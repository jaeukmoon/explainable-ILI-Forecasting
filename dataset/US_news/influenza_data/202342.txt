However, the ecological and virological properties that underscore future mitigation strategies still remain unclear. Using epidemiological, spatial and genomic approaches, we demonstrate changes in the origins of resurgent HPAI H5 and reveal significant shifts in virus ecology and evolution. Outbreak data show key resurgent events in 2016–2017 and 2020–2021, contributing to the emergence and panzootic spread of H5N1 in 2021–2022. Genomic analysis reveals that the 2016–2017 epizootics originated in Asia, where HPAI H5 reservoirs are endemic. In 2020–2021, 2.3.4.4b H5N8 viruses emerged in African poultry, featuring mutations altering HA structure and receptor binding. In 2021–2022, a new H5N1 virus evolved through reassortment in wild birds in Europe, undergoing further reassortment with low-pathogenic avian influenza in wild and domestic birds during global dissemination. These results highlight a shift in the HPAI H5 epicentre beyond Asia and indicate that increasing persistence of HPAI H5 in wild birds is facilitating geographic and host range expansion, accelerating dispersion velocity and increasing reassortment potential. As earlier outbreaks of H5N1 and H5N8 were caused by more stable genomic constellations, these recent changes reflect adaptation across the domestic-bird–wild-bird interface. Elimination strategies in domestic birds therefore remain a high priority to limit future epizootics.

Facts About the Canine Influenza Vaccine Back To Common Conditions Do Dogs Need a Flu Shot? Facts About the Canine Influenza Vaccine By Dr. Jerry Klein, CVO Updated: Oct 19, 2023 | 4 Minutes Updated: Oct 19, 2023 | 4 Minutes vaccinations canine influenza dog flu flu shot Outbreaks of canine influenza virus, also known as the “dog flu,” can occur anywhere at any time. As with human influenza, the dog flu stays with them. The difference is that we now know which viruses cause the two different strains of influenza, which helps veterinarians diagnose and treat the illness properly. There are now vaccines available for both known strains of canine influenza: H3N8 and the more recent H3N2. In fact, you may be able to obtain one vaccine for both depends on what your vet offers. Dogs most susceptible to canine influenza are those that frequent communal activities: dog parks, dog events, grooming shops, daycare and boarding facilities. Any dogs can contract the virus from other infected dogs or from vectors, which are inanimate objects such as dog bowls, clothing, etc., that have recently been exposed to the virus. It is important to note that people don’t become infected by dogs infected with influenza, and dogs do not become infected by humans infected with the flu. It’s safe to be around your dog when they have canine influenza, just as they can be around you when you have the flu. Here are some things to note about the canine influenza vaccine, from the American Kennel Club’s Chief Veterinary Officer, Dr. Jerry Klein, who was personally involved in treating hundreds of dogs sickened by the virus during its initial outbreak in Chicago in the spring of 2015. Do Dogs Need a Flu Shot? Most veterinarians do recommend getting the vaccine for canine influenza, especially for dogs who frequent the groups mentioned above that are higher-risk. Owners of boarding and daycare facilities may require vaccination of dogs frequenting their establishments. In general, dogs that participate in events and social activities should be fully vaccinated for core vaccines as well as Bordetella and canine influenza. Just like humans, it’s best to get your dog the flu shot each year. To be fully vaccinated against influenza, dogs should receive two initial sets of vaccinations followed by a yearly booster. Can Dogs Die From the Flu? Though dogs can die of the flu, as in humans, the majority don’t. Cases usually do require veterinary attention, regardless of severity. The signs of influenza are usually lethargy, fever, decrease in appetite, cough, runny eyesose, and possible vomiting. Worsening signs are the development of pneumonia. Which Dogs Are Most At Risk for Canine Influenza? Whether your dog is often in social spaces or lives in a single-pet household, it’s important to try to minimize the risk of canine influenza. Since it’s a highly contagious disease, it can easily spread through infected dogs that are in close proximity, contact with contaminated vectors, or people moving between infected and uninfected dogs that can transfer the virus. Most dogs exposed to the virus will contract it, and about 80% will show symptoms of illness. Dogs can also contract and spread the virus without showing symptoms. The incubation period of canine influenza is approximately 2 to 4 days from initial exposure to the dog, often even before showing symptoms. Viral shedding starts to decrease after the fourth day, but dogs with H3N8 can remain contagious for up to 10 days after exposure, and dogs with H3N2 can remain contagious for up to 26 days. Most dogs will completely recover with proper treatment, but the disease can be fatal. stonena7 via Getty Images Symptoms of Canine Influenza Dry, hacking cough (similar to kennel cough but can progress to a moist, congested cough) Lack of appetite Lethargy Discharge from the nose or eyes that may become green or thick Fever (normal temperature is 101-102 degrees) Preventing Canine Influenza The best prevention is vaccination. There is now a single vaccination to prevent both the H3N2 and H3N8 strains of the virus. The vaccination requires a booster shot two weeks after the initial vaccine. Vaccines take 3-4 weeks to provide immunity. Practice good sanitation. Use a bleach and water mixture to disinfect common areas such as tables, bowls, leashes, crates, etc. Allow items to thoroughly air dry before exposing dogs to them. Wash your hands frequently, especially between handling different dogs. At the very minimum, hand sanitizer should be used between handling dogs. Use disposable gowns or wipe down clothing and shoes with a bleach solution between dogs or after leaving an area where dogs congregate. If your dog does get sick, isolate them and keep them isolated for up to 21 days after symptoms subside. How is Canine Influenza Treated? Treatment of canine influenza virus requires veterinary assistance. If you believe your dog may have canine influenza virus, contact your veterinarian immediately. Untreated, the illness may progress to pneumonia or other, more serious problem. If your dog is going to a veterinary hospital or clinic, call ahead to let them know you have a suspected case of canine influenza virus. They may ask you to follow a specific protocol before entering to minimize the spread of the disease, including waiting in your car until they are ready to examine your dog. Any dog suspected of having canine influenza virus should be immediately isolated from other dogs and should not attend dog shows, daycare, grooming facilities, dog parks, or other places dogs gather. Dogs are contagious for 7-10 days after they have stopped showing symptoms Keep sick dogs at home and isolated from other dogs and cats until you are certain the illness has run its course (typically 3-4 weeks). Most dogs take 2-3 weeks to recover from the illness, however, some otherwise healthy dogs have died from it.

Vaccination is an effective approach used to prevent influenza infection. Influenza vaccines are developed using hemagglutinin (HA), a surface antigen of the virus that induces an immune response. A recent Npj Vaccines study evaluates the efficacy of a quadrivalent messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccine encoding HA from four seasonal influenza strains. Study: Seasonal quadrivalent mRNA vaccine prevents and mitigates influenza infection. Image Credit: 89stocker / Shutterstock.com Importance of influenza vaccination Influenza is a respiratory infection that manifests in annual epidemics and sporadic pandemics. The four influenza subtypes endemic in humans are A(H1N1), B-Yamagata lineage, A(H3N2), and B-Victoria lineage. This seasonal viral infection causes up to 650,000 deaths annually worldwide. The first influenza vaccine was developed in the 1940s by harvesting inactivated viruses from the allantoic fluid of embryonated hens' eggs. Currently, three types of influenza vaccines are available in the United States, including live attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIV), inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV), and recombinant HA protein subunit vaccines. Although HA is highly immunogenic, it undergoes continual antigenic drift; therefore, updating vaccines based on the dominantly circulating influenza virus strain is imperative. Importantly, virus strain selection occurs six months prior to vaccine use, which creates an opportunity for a new variant to emerge and become unexpectedly dominant. A similar incident occurred between 2015 and 2016 during the Northern Hemisphere flu season. Advantages of mRNA-based influenza vaccine Although mRNA-based vaccines were being designed and developed for over a decade, the onset of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) accelerated the development process for its timely clinical use. Since then, millions of people throughout the world have received mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines that effectively protect them against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causal agent of the pandemic. Compared to conventional IIV and LAIV influenza vaccines, mRNA-based vaccines have many advantages, including their in vitro production process without the use of eggs or cell culture. The mRNA technology also eliminates the risk of viral growth-promoting mutations that might influence antigenicity. Another advantage of an mRNA-based influenza vaccine is reduced production time compared to other vaccine types. This could be beneficial in reducing the time window between the vaccination program and virus strain selection and manufacturing. Development and effectiveness of a new quadrivalent influenza mRNA vaccine The current study evaluated the effectiveness of a quadrivalent mRNA vaccine encoding HA from four seasonal influenza viruses, including A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 (H3N2), B/Phuket/3073/2013 (B-Yamagata lineage), A/California/07/2009 (H1N1), and B/Brisbane/60/2008 (B-Victoria lineage). This vaccine, developed by GreenLight Biosciences (GLB), exhibited significant immunogenicity and protectivity in a mouse model. Related StoriesMpox vaccine allocation targets 9 African countriesResearch suggests no need for yellow fever vaccine booster after initial doseThrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura cases after CoronaVac raise concerns over vaccine safetyThe mRNA vaccine was encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles (LPN) developed by Acuitas Therapeutics. The LPN used for mRNA encapsulation consisted of four lipid components, including a saturated phospholipid, a proprietary cationic lipid, cholesterol, and a polyethylene glycol (PEG)-lipid. The mRNA construction was optimized based on immunogenicity and protective efficacy obtained after altering CA09 HA mRNA vaccines. As compared to unmodified mRNA vaccines, modified mRNA vaccines triggered significantly higher antibody titers. Similar to that of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, the new influenza vaccine used pseudouridine, thus reflecting the safety and efficacy of vaccine components in clinical settings. Monovalent and quadrivalent mRNA was used to assess immune activation at doses of 30 micrograms (μg) of each antigen. This vaccine dosage elicited antibody production against each subtype, which enhanced the vaccine's potency against various influenza strains. In vivo studies revealed that the quadrivalent mRNA influenza vaccine was well tolerated at a concentration of 120 µg without any adverse effects. This finding indicated that a dose of 40 µg of each strain, which was used to construct quadrivalent mRNA, was sufficient for clinical use. When the vaccine dose was lowered to a dose of one μg of each component, it induced protection against the A/California/04/2009 challenge. Furthermore, no morbidity was observed at this dose. A single 10 μg dose of the GLB quadrivalent mRNA vaccine exhibited complete protection in mice subjected to the CA09 challenge. However, antibody titers against the HK14 HA antigens after this dose were low, thus indicating that a larger dose of quadrivalent mRNA may be needed. Conclusions The current preclinical study used a mouse model to assess the effectiveness of quadrivalent mRNA influenza vaccines developed by targeting HA from four seasonal influenza subtypes. Robust antibody titers were recorded post-vaccination without any adverse effects. Admixed mRNA-LNP quadrivalent vaccines induced immune responses, even at a very low dose of 1 μg. More research is needed to understand the effect of mRNA-based quadrivalent influenza vaccination on T-cell responses. Future studies must also determine the kinetics of antibody maintenance following vaccination. Journal reference: Kackos, C. M., DeBeauchamp, J., Davitt, C. J. H., et al.

Back to Healio Key takeaways:Since 2018, fewer than 64% of eligible children have been vaccinated against influenza each season.Previously vaccinated children had a lower probability of receiving a vaccine if they lived in a county with high COVID-19 severity.Vaccine mandates played a significant role in boosting influenza vaccination rates during the 2020-2021 influenza season, researchers reported in Pediatrics. Claire Abraham, MD, MPH, a pediatrician at the Children's Hospital Primary Care Center at Boston Children’s Hospital, told Healio that the study was inspired by an interest in the policies and environmental factors that impact people’s vaccination behaviors. “It’s well established that vaccinating children against influenza decreases flu-related morbidity and mortality, as well as community spread,” Abraham told Healio. “However, in the past 5 years, fewer than 64% of eligible children have been vaccinated each season.” “When Massachusetts announced a flu vaccine mandate, it seemed like a great natural experiment to see if such an approach might change vaccination uptake,” Abraham said.Abraham and colleagues used insurance claims data from a regional insurer to examine influenza vaccination practices across the 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 seasons among 71,333 children in Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Maine aged between 6 months to 18 years. “Using an individual-level logistic regression model, we assessed whether living in a state with an influenza vaccine mandate or community COVID severity predicted influenza vaccine uptake in the 2020-2021 influenza season and whether these effects differed based on a child’s prior influenza vaccination status,” Abraham said.Ultimately, the researchers found that children living in states with vaccine mandates during the 2020-2021 influenza season had a higher predicted probability (47.7%) of receiving an influenza vaccine than those living in states without a mandate (21.2%).For families who vaccinated their children in years prior and who lived in areas with elevated COVID-19 numbers during the 2020-2021 influenza season, however, previously vaccinated children had a lower probability of receiving an influenza vaccine if they lived in a county with the highest COVID-19 severity (72.1%) compared with a county with low COVID-19 severity (77.3%).“It was interesting to see how significantly a flu vaccine mandate increased vaccination rates, especially among those who had not been vaccinated in the prior season,” Abraham said. “Prior nonvaccinators living in a state with a vaccine mandate had a 26.5% higher predicted probability of receiving a flu vaccine in 2020-2021 than prior nonvaccinators living in a state without a mandate. This was a significantly larger effect than that seen in prior vaccinators. To me this highlighted how many people are willing to vaccinate in certain circumstances, particularly when given clear reasons to do so, even if they don’t always vaccinate against the flu.”according to the researchers, reasons for lower rates included avoiding in-person clinic visits based on fear of COVID-19 exposure, inability to schedule appointments because of limited availability of in-person office visits or lack of options for a vaccination if a school service shut down with the switch to remote learning. Understanding how the COVID-19 response and mandate policies affected changes in decision-making about influenza vaccination — particularly for previously unvaccinated children — might be able to inform the development of future strategies to increase youth vaccination rates for influenza and other infectious diseases like COVID-19.“We should all be discussing the importance of flu vaccination with our patients every season, regardless of whether they accepted or declined a flu vaccine in prior seasons,” Abraham said.Abraham also cautioned that such mandates are not a catch-all solution.“It's also important to note that even in a state with a vaccine mandate, the predicted probability of flu vaccination among prior nonvaccinators remained below 50%,” Abraham said. “So, while mandates are an effective way to increase vaccination rates, they aren’t a perfect solution.”Future studies, she said, should examine how this affects families down the road.“Further work is needed to enhance communication and policy strategies incentivizing hesitant caregivers to consistently vaccinate children against influenza,” Abraham said. “Separately, future studies are needed to assess the downstream effects of the COVID pandemic on family decisions about influenza vaccination.” Sources/DisclosuresCollapse Source: Abraham C, et al.

Doctors Share How Long to Stay Home With the FluAnd is the flu contagious prior to symptom onset?By Korin MillerUpdated: Oct 19, 2023Save ArticleJump to:Flu symptomsHow long is the flu contagious?How does the flu spread? How to keep from spreading the fluThe flu (a.k.a. influenza) is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses that infect the nose, throat, and lungs, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There are two main types of flu viruses—types A and B—and they usually circulate during flu season every year. But how long is the flu contagious? And exactly how long should you stay home when you have the flu? Meet the Experts: Amesh A. Adalja, M.D., a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security; Thomas Russo, M.D., professor and chief of infectious disease at the University at Buffalo in New York; and David Cennimo, M.D., assistant professor of medicine, infectious disease at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School. Last year, the flu spiked in November as opposed to the usual later January-February hot spot, David Dowdy, M.D., an infectious disease expert and professor of epidemiology told John Hopikins’ Bloomberg School of Public Health in July. “We probably are a bit more likely to have an early flu season this year—again, just because the last flu season was pushed early, too,” he explained. “And it might take another year or two for us to get back to the usual way of things.”Given that the past few years have made everyone stop and think about how we catch and pass on illnesses, understanding how long the flu is contagious is vital—especially if you’re unlucky enough to get it. Curious about when you can safely be around others after having the flu? Experts break it down.Flu symptomsThe flu can cause the following symptoms, per the CDC:fever or feeling feverish/chillscoughsore throatrunny or stuffy nosemuscle or body achesheadachesfatigueVomiting and diarrhea (this is more common in children than adults)How long is the flu contagious?There’s a spectrum here. People with the flu are most contagious in the three to four days after they develop symptoms, the CDC says. Most people can infect other people up to a day before their symptoms start and up to five to seven days after they show signs of the virus. Kids and people with weakened immune systems may be able to pass on the virus for more than seven days. But there are a few variables that come into play. “Contagiousness for an infectious disease is not an on-and-off switch,” says Amesh A. Adalja, M.D., a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. “But it’s important to remember that, as you get further out from when your symptoms started, you could still be contagious.”Things like taking oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and being vaccinated against the flu should also shorten the amount of time you’re sick—and infectious, adds Thomas Russo, M.D., professor and chief of infectious disease at the University at Buffalo in New York. Baloxivir (Xofluza) “does likely diminish contagiousness as seen in household attack rate studies,” Dr. Adalja says. One study published in 2022, for example, found that other family members got the flu 9.5% of the time when a patient took baloxivir compared to 19% when the patient took oseltamivir.Still, Dr. Russo says, “I like to consider people infectious up to seven days, just to be safe.”As a whole, “people are generally most contagious one to four days after they fall ill,” says David Cennimo, M.D., assistant professor of medicine and infectious disease at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School. “This time of maximal infectivity generally coincides with the time of the worst symptoms [and] most household infections happen right away,” he adds. How does the flu spread?The flu is thought to be mainly spread by droplets that are created when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. Those droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into their lungs, the CDC explains. Less commonly, a person could get the flu by touching a surface or object that has flu virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or eyes. How to keep from spreading the fluIf you have the flu and you’re able to isolate, Dr. Adalja recommends doing just that. That means you should try to sleep apart from other members of your household and use a different bathroom if you have one. You should stay in isolation until you’re fever-free for 24 hours, Dr. Adalja says. And, if you need to be around others, he suggests wearing a high-quality mask to lower the risk you’ll infect them. “The same things that work with COVID should work with the flu,” Dr. Russo says. If it’s within seven days since you were diagnosed and you’re out and about, Dr. Russo recommends wearing a mask to help lower the risk you’ll spread the virus to others. “That’s particularly true if you’re interacting with vulnerable people,” like the elderly, very young, or pregnant people, he says.“I’m hoping that people will be considerate of others and do what they can in terms of minimizing risk of spreading the flu to others if they get infected,” Dr. Russo says. “Influenza is still a lethal virus.”Related StoriesHow to Tell If Your Nasty Cold Is Actually the FluDo I Have COVID, the Flu, or RSV?Flu Shot Side Effects You Should KnowAdvertisement - Continue Reading BelowFlu Season7 Ways to Get Over the Flu FasterCan You Get Your COVID and Flu Shots at Once?FDA Approves New Home Flu VaccineCDC Warns About Flu Deaths in KidsAdvertisement - Continue Reading BelowAt-Home Flu Vaccine May Be Available Next YearFlu Shot Side Effects You Should KnowWhen Will Flu Season Start and End This Year?5 Myths About Colds and Flu, DebunkedDoctors Share Exactly When to Get the Flu ShotWhat Is the Deadly H3N2 Flu?This Is the Most Effective Way to Prevent the FluU.S. Flu Activity Is up 23%Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowAbout Prevention.comNewsletterPress RoomGive A GiftCommunity GuidelinesSubscribeMedia KitAdvertise OnlineOther Hearst SubscriptionsCustomer ServiceA Part of Hearst Digital MediaWe may earn commission from links on this page, but we only recommend products we back.©2024 Hearst Magazines, Inc.

About 35% of all flu hospitalizations were reported in the southeast of the U.S., which experts say is a typical trend at the start of the flu season.MORE: What to expect with COVID, RSV, flu shots set to be available this fallMost of the flu cases detected were Influenza A and the most common subtype was Influenza A(H1N1), which is the strain of the virus that the flu vaccine usually offers better protection from, according to the CDC.The percent of all reported respiratory viruses circulating over the past week have been relatively unchanged nationally, but there is regional variability. Region 9 -- made up of Arizona, California, Hawaii, and Nevada -- was the only region that saw an increase.Still, the numbers in all regions of the U.S. remain below their baseline and outpatient respiratory illness activity is either minimal or low throughout most of the U.S., according to the CDC.A Weekly Influenza Surveillance Report Prepared by the Influenza Division Outpatient Respiratory Illness Activity Map Determined by Data Reported to ILINetILINetAlaska is the only state that is currently experiencing moderate respiratory illness activity. Influenza typically circulates this time of year and peaks between December and February for most of the U.S., according to the CDC.Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) numbers are on the rise and are projected to increase further, according to the CDC's weekly surveillance. RSV typically circulates from October to April, according to the CDC.How to prepare for this year's cold and flu season This time last year, the U.S. was bracing for a "tripledemic" amid rising cases of COVID-19, influenza and RSV after the seasons became more unpredictable during the COVID-19 pandemic.Dr. John Brownstein, chief innovation officer at Boston Children's Hospital and an ABC News contributor, said these early cases are behaving in a more predictable pattern."The data is pointing to something a little bit more par for the course. We're seeing the early rise of RSV and flu at a time when you'd expect it," Brownstein said.MORE: COVID, RSV and influenza likely to impact health care system this year: CDCBrownstein, however, cautioned that cases of respiratory viruses are expected to increase further and higher levels still have potential to strain health systems and cause severe illnesses, Brownstein said."I think there's still concern around the threat of all three respiratory viruses plus, of course, the rest of the seasonal mix [of viral illnesses], wreaking havoc on our health systems," he said.Experts are hopeful that new and updated immunizations that protect against COVID-19, influenza and RSV will stave off the strain on health care systems.A flu shot appears to be given in this undated stock photo.STOCK PHOTO/Getty ImagesThese viruses may only cause mild illness for many people, but young babies, pregnant women, people who are immunocompromised and the elderly are at highest risk for severe disease.Everyone 6 months and older is eligible for an updated COVID-19 shot and the annual flu vaccine.The Department of Health and Human Services told ABC News that, so far, more than 7 million updated COVID-19 shots have been administered. The CDC recommends getting the COVID-19 and flu vaccines by the end of October and encourages both to be given at the same time.Adults who are 60 years and older can get an RSV vaccine and pregnant women who are in their third trimester can get an RSV shot that provides protection against RSV to their baby for the first 6 months of life.Babies less than 8 months old who are born to mothers who did not get an RSV vaccine during pregnancy can get a protective shot called nirsevimab that offers about five months of protection against RSV.MORE: 6 things experts say can help keep kids healthy in school amid flu, RSV and COVIDNirsevimab is a one-dose shot made of monoclonal antibodies, which are proteins manufactured in a lab and mimic the antibodies the body naturally creates when fighting an infection. This is different than a vaccine, which activates the immune system.Brownstein said the pandemic has helped make many health systems better prepared for seasonal spikes in respiratory viruses and is hopeful that people are more motivated to stay up to date on shots that are available for protection and prevention this respiratory virus season."Now is really the time to get the protection advanced of the seasons really heating up," Brownstein said.Dr. Jade A Cobern, M.D., M.P.H, a licensed and practicing physician, is a member of the ABC News Medical Unit.Related TopicsFlu SeasonRSV casesPopular ReadsTrump's plan for education in his second termNov 11, 4:56 PMSotomayor has no plans to resign: SourcesNov 10, 4:27 PMArrest in fatal shooting at Tuskegee UniversityNov 10, 6:35 PMMissing American tourist in Hungary killed: PoliceNov 9, 1:36 PM538's final forecasts for the 2024 electionNov 5, 7:49 AMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkAbout Nielsen MeasurementChildren's Online Privacy PolicyContact UsDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationInterest-Based AdsPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseYour US State Privacy Rights © 2024 ABC NewsPandemic Flu Has Many Potential Pathways Close Menu Facebook X (Twitter) Instagram Facebook Instagram Threads Subscribe Featured News Funding Directory Jobs Events Advertisement Biosurveillance Pandemic Flu Has Many Potential PathwaysBy Global Biodefense StaffOctober 19, 2023 H3N2 influenza strain. Credit: NIAID Share Facebook LinkedIn Reddit Email Influenza viruses are believed to have sparked at least 14 human pandemics in the past 500 years; the most devastating of which began in 1918. Yet, despite intense study and considerable advances in public health, virus surveillance and virology, there is no simple answer to this pressing question: when and how will the next flu pandemic arise? NIAID scientists consider the many potential pathways to future influenza pandemics in a new viewpoints essay in Science Translational Medicine. There are no hard and fast ‘rules’ specifying, for example, what characteristics a given avian influenza virus must possess to allow it to efficiently infect people and other mammals, the authors note. Instead, “current and historical evidence suggests that pandemics result from highly variable, and extremely rare, viral adaptational phenomena that can be understood only in hindsight.” In the face of this humbling reality, the authors conclude, preparation for future pandemics must include basic research into ‘host switching’ and how the virus adapts to new hosts; expanded surveillance of viral emergence at the animal-human interface; and continued efforts to develop broadly protective vaccines.

The year is not 2020 but 1918, and Harriet Jane Lawrence is developing a vaccine against the deadliest influenza outbreak the world has ever seenBy Erica Huang, Amy Scharf & The Lost Women of Science Initiative Paula ManginHarriet Jane Lawrence was one of the first female pathologists in the U.S. In the early 1900s she worked in Portland, Ore., where she hunted microbes and developed vaccines and serum therapies with the help of 200 guinea pigs that she kept in her garage. Her work on a vaccine during the 1918 influenza pandemic earned her presidential recognition and has had a lasting impact on medicine.LISTEN TO THE PODCASTOn supporting science journalismIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing.

She wrote in about a scientist named Harriet Jane Lawrence, a pathologist working in Oregon in the early 1900s.Producer Erica Huang brings us her story.Essie Jenkins: “1919 Influenza Blues”:It was in nineteen hundred and nineteenYes men and women was dyin’,Erica Huang: This is Essie Jenkins, singing a tune called “1919 Influenza Blues”.Essie Jenkins: With the stuff which the doctors called the flu.Erica Huang: If you don’t know about the 1919 Influenza that she’s singing about here, also called the Spanish Flu or the 1918 flu, you’re not alone – until our more recent pandemic caused a surge in interest, the 1918 flu was widely considered “forgotten”. World War I was taking up all the newspaper real estate at the time, and then-president Woodrow Wilson never made a single public statement about it. Despite the fact that it killed over 600,000 people in the U.S. alone.And in the chorus that’s coming up here, Essie sings some lyrics that point to something else interesting about this flu.Essie Jenkins: But it was God's almighty plan,He was judging this old landErica Huang: She says “it was God’s almighty plan. He was judging this old land”. And for the people living (and dying) through this flu in 1918, that was the only answer they had about what was happening. Because in 1918, no one knew that influenza was caused by a virus.Which brings us to scientist Harriet Jane Lawrence.Gloria Hodes: First of all, she was one of the first women pathologists in America.Erica Huang: This is Gloria Hodes, who wrote to us about Lawrence.Gloria Hodes: She was as far as I know the first woman pathologist in Oregon.Erica Huang: And Gloria knew her personally. She was a family friend.Gloria Hodes: She had met my mother at a PTA meeting, and we became friends. I often went to her lab. And she would let me look through the microscope and count cells.In Portland, so many doctors would of course seek her services. And I would often be in her lab when they would come. But I, you know, I was very very young, and I didn’t totally understand. I knew that she used her guinea pigs, ha!Erica Huang: This is something that is mentioned constantly in the records I’ve found about Lawrence. Guinea pigs.Gloria Hodes: Two hundred guinea pigs!Erica Huang: That she kept in her garage at her house in Portland, and used literally as guinea pigs – to develop vaccines and serum therapies.So how did Harriet Jane Lawrence end up here in Portland, with 200 guinea pigs in her garage?Let’s go back a bit.Harriet Jane Lawrence was born in 1883, in Maine. When she was just 15, she started teaching at a nearby schoolhouse. She used the money she made to put herself through college, and through medical school at Boston University.After graduating, she moved to Oregon and opened her own laboratory in the Selling building, which is one of Portland’s historic landmarks.As Gloria mentioned, Dr. Lawrence was one of the first women pathologists in the country. And she made it a point to champion other people who were overlooked in the sciences too. She aided Oregon doctor Alan L. Hart, who underwent one of the first recorded cases of gender affirming surgery when he got a hysterectomy in 1917. She also wrote him a letter of recommendation, which helped him find work as a staff physician.And then, came the flu.So it’s 1918, and hospitals across Oregon are filled with flu patients – the numbers of infected people keep climbing, and the hospitals are at capacity. It’s a pandemic. I’m sure it’s not too hard to imagine what that was like.I wanted to know what the state of American medicine was like in 1918. So I asked an expert.John Barry: Yes, I’m here because I wrote a book called The Great Influenza, about the 1918 pandemic.Erica Huang: This is John Barry.John Barry: There was a revolution in American medicine that was extraordinarily rapid. Really a period of maybe three decades. It went from probably the worst in the developed world, to pretty much equal to the best, from 1890 to just around the time of the pandemic.Erica Huang: But even though there had been some amazing advances in immunology, and vaccines and antitoxins had been developed to treat some diseases like diphtheria and tetanus, there was still a lot they didn’t know. Most importantly:John Barry: They didn’t even know what a virus was.Erica Huang: Bacteria and viruses are fundamentally different. Bacteria are larger, single cells that can survive on their own. Viruses are much smaller, and they cause infection by entering and multiplying inside the host’s healthy cells. They’re harder to find, and harder to target.Erica Huang (interview): It seemed like a lot of the initial race to develop treatments and things like that was entirely focused on “which bacteria is causing this?”John Barry: Right, as Goethe said, you look where you have light. And they understood bacteria. Many scientists around the country were trying to target that bacteria for a vaccine. They had em in Boston, they had em in Philadelphia, they had em in New York, you know, they had em in Portland, Oregon.Erica Huang: Where Harriet Jane Lawrence was working at her lab in the Selling building.So The Oregon Board of Health brought an infected tissue sample from the navy yard in Bremerton, Washington, to Dr. Lawrence’s lab in Portland. And she decides that the bacteria she’s going to target with her vaccine is hemolytic streptococcus, which had been showing up again and again in flu patients. She isolates the pathogen from the sample, and grows a culture of it – then uses that to produce a batch of the vaccine. This was an arduous and time consuming process – at least three weeks of work. And she and her contemporaries around the country were working against a flu that was moving through the population at breakneck speed.So this begs the question, right – if all these scientists were pulling all these sleepless nights developing the wrong thing, was all this work in vain? No. Here’s why.Michael Worobey: The vast majority of people who died from flu, died of secondary bacterial pneumonia.Erica Huang: This is Michael Worobey, a Professor of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, giving a talk at The University of Arizona about the role that pneumonia played in the 1918 pandemic.Michael Worobey: It’s the way flu has always killed, and it’s the way it kills now.Erica Huang: And people got pneumonia through the bacteria that invaded their systems, after they were infected with the virus. One bacteria in particular was a common culprit: Hemolytic Streptococcus. And this is the bacteria that Dr. Lawrence’s vaccine targeted.Michael Worobey: Pneumonia is really, really deadly. It creates inflammation, fluid buildup in your lungs, where you need them clear for oxygen. And that’s what killed people in 1918.Erica Huang: I should say, we don’t know exactly how much of an impact her specific vaccine had on pneumonia in flu patients. There are different strains of bacteria that cause pneumonia, and her vaccine would have only worked against a subset of them. But in 2010, there was an article published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases, which analyzed a number of studies on these bacterial vaccines. And it suggests that hemolytic streptococci vaccines provided “significant protection” against pneumonia and mortality.So, was this work in vain? No! It wasn’t a perfect solution, but it most likely saved lives. And also, the vaccines that were created to fight pneumonia during that time, are still helping us out today.John Barry: The pneumonia vaccine you get today is a straight line descendant of one that was developed during the pandemic.Erica Huang: Dr. Lawrence’s vaccine was distributed to flu patients across Oregon. And Lawrence was recognized on a national scale for this work.Gloria Hodes: President Woodrow Wilson honored her for the work that she did on this.Erica Huang: In the years following the worst of the pandemic, Doctor Lawrence continued to develop vaccines and serums to fight diseases (this is where the garage full of guinea pigs comes in).She also became a fellow with the American Society of Clinical Pathologists, and served on the executive committee of the Medical Club of Portland.Gloria actually didn’t know about any of this, until she recently looked Doctor Lawrence up as she was preparing to share her story with us.Gloria Hodes: I just had no idea. To me she was just sweet Dr. Lawrence, with the little wispy grays in her face when she would come for dinner. She was - she was amazing!Erica Huang: Gloria is not a scientist.Gloria Hodes: I am a singer and a performer.Erica Huang: But in her stories about Doctor Lawrence, you can hear the love of science being passed down – the things Doctor Lawrence impressed upon her, that were maybe more important to share than the accolades. The wonder of the lab, and the search for the unseen.Amy Scharf: This episode of Lost Women of Science: From Our Inbox was produced and engineered by Erica Huang, and recorded at Good Studio in Brooklyn.

Email X (Twitter) Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger An outbreak of avian flu – a highly contagious viral infection that affects wild birds as well as poultry – has hit poultry farms in South Africa. Two different strains are causing outbreaks in the country – A(H5N1) and influenza A(H7N6). A specialist in poultry health, Shahn Bisschop, answers some questions put to him by The Conversation Africa. What strain has broken out in South Africa? The outbreak caused by a highly pathogenic (HPAI) strain of H7N6 avian influenza is causing the most concern at present. The strain was first confirmed in chickens near Delmas north of Johannesburg at the beginning of June 2023. This virus is a novel mutation of a strain which originated from wild birds at or near the location of the original outbreak. The strain is well-adapted to chickens – it infects them easily and replicates effectively in them, in preference to other avian species – and spreads very easily between birds and farms. An estimated 10 million have become infected while 6 million died from the H7N6. A further 1.7 million died from H5N1 earlier in the year. The conventional control measures (collectively known as biosecurity) have been less effective than usual in limiting the spread of the disease. The main measures taken on poultry farms include strictly limiting human and vehicle movement. People entering farms will typically take further measures to limit disease transmission such as showering, changing clothes and disinfecting footwear when moving between different parts of the farm. Because wild birds are associated with the spread of avian flu, measures are taken to ensure they are completely excluded from all chicken sheds. What’s new this time? For at least the past nine years, HPAI H5 viruses of the 2.3.4.4 clade have been spread across the globe principally by wild bird migrations and infect a range of avian and mammalian species. The first recorded cases caused by viruses belonging to this clade were reported in South Africa in 2017. A second outbreak occurred in 2020. It was anticipated that the next outbreak would probably also be caused by these viruses and indeed the first reported cases of HPAI in 2023 in the coastal regions were associated with H5 strains. Local experts are working on the theory that the present outbreak of H7N6 HPAI was created when a low pathogenicity AI (LPAI) virus circulating without causing disease in wild birds underwent a mutation to become an HPAI strain adapted to causing serious disease in chickens. This mutation occurred locally. Mutation from LPAI to HPAI has been described in poultry in various parts of the world but was considered less likely than the return of the H5 clade 2.3.4.4 viruses previously encountered. What’s in place and what’s missing Avian influenza is a “controlled disease”. That means it’s placed under strict government control with the aim of eradication as quickly as possible when outbreaks are detected. All outbreaks on farms are immediately reported to the state veterinary service, which takes responsibility for the disease. The protocol for HPAI control is that all affected farms are placed under strict quarantine and all surviving birds are destroyed and disposed of as quickly as possible in order to limit the further spread of the disease. But there are weaknesses in the system. The biggest is that the state veterinary services don’t have sufficient resources to manage the outbreaks effectively. Secondly, because the state doesn’t compensate farmers for their losses, they have difficulty getting farmers to comply with orders to cull. This has meant that outbreaks have spread out of control. Infected birds have been moved off infected farms for sale – taking the disease with them. Farmers in the EU and US are compensated when culling happens. This used to be the case in South Africa but no longer happens. As a result, South Africa has struggled to contain HPAI outbreaks. In 2017 and 2020/21 the outbreaks gradually slowed and eventually stopped. HPAI outbreaks tend to be seasonal. In Europe, they occur principally in winter months. In South Africa, there is a similar but less clear trend to more cases in the winter and fewer in summer. This may be related to reduced viral survival in hotter summer weather. Are there new approaches to consider? New and innovative thinking is needed to deal with the reality on the ground in South Africa. One possible solution is the introduction of appropriate vaccines. This would reduce the losses associated with outbreaks and would slow the spread of the disease between farms. Like all vaccines, they can’t prevent birds from becoming infected but they can manage the level of infection and spread. But they can’t eradicate the disease. But there are limited options in terms of available vaccines. And South Africa would need to ensure that the vaccines registered for use in the country were effective against the local strain. If vaccines are poorly matched to outbreak strains, they won’t be effective. All of this will take time, even with the best effort of government and industry. Does the strain pose a risk to people? What should consumers should be aware of? The South African Poultry Association has made it clear that poultry products are safe for consumption. It has been collaborating with the University of Pretoria to make sure poultry products are indeed safe. Together with leading scientists they have sequenced the current field strain of H7 avian influenza virus. In a recent paper scientists reported that none of the amino acid markers were present that afford the virus the ability to bind to mammalian cells. This shows that infection of humans with the current virus is highly unlikely.

Aging impairs the immune response to influenza, both intrinsically and because of altered interactions with endothelial and pulmonary epithelial cells. To characterize these changes, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), spatial transcriptomics, and bulk RNA sequencing (bulk RNA-seq) on lung tissue from young and aged female mice at days 0, 3, and 9 post-influenza infection. Our analyses identified dozens of key genes differentially expressed in kinetic, age-dependent, and cell type-specific manners. Aged immune cells exhibited altered inflammatory, memory, and chemotactic profiles. Aged endothelial cells demonstrated characteristics of reduced vascular wound healing and a prothrombotic state. Spatial transcriptomics identified novel profibrotic and antifibrotic markers expressed by epithelial and non-epithelial cells, highlighting the complex networks that promote fibrosis in aged lungs. Bulk RNA-seq generated a timeline of global transcriptional activity, showing increased expression of genes involved in inflammation and coagulation in aged lungs. Our work provides an atlas of high-throughput sequencing methodologies that can be used to investigate age-related changes in the response to influenza virus, identify novel cell-cell interactions for further study, and ultimately uncover potential therapeutic targets to improve health outcomes in the elderly following influenza infection.

Infections with IAV are generally nonlethal; however, certain patient populations are at high risk of mortality, including young children, the immunocompromised, and the elderly2. Increased age is strongly correlated with both increased morbidity and mortality following influenza virus infection3, as aging impairs both the human immune response to natural influenza infection and the anamnestic response to influenza vaccination4,5,6,7. Murine models of aging have been shown to have qualitatively and quantitively impaired anti-influenza immune responses: aged lungs exhibit altered myeloid cell recruitment and function;8,9 lower titers of neutralizing antibodies;10 and delayed and diminished recruitment of CD4 and CD8 T cells to the lung during infection, which results in delayed viral clearance11,12,13. Aged mice also have impaired memory T cell responses, with tissue-resident memory (TRM) CD8 T cells in aged mice exhibiting impaired antiviral recall functionality and instead promoting lung fibrosis following infection resolution14.The lungs and airways are comprised of several different types of epithelial cells with specialized functions, including type 1 (AT1) and type 2 (AT2) pneumocytes; goblet, ciliated, and club cells; and a variety of fibroblasts15. In addition, the lungs are a highly vascularized site, with dense capillary networks necessary to support gas exchange16. Two recent studies have used scRNA-seq to identify a novel population of endothelial cells that promote vascular regeneration in the murine lung17,18, and another has identified vascular heterogeneity in the human lung19, emphasizing the vast cellular heterogeneity of both epithelial and endothelial cells in the lungs.Aging alters all organ systems, not just the immune system; as such, aging may also impact the host response to IAV through direct changes in lung tissue. As a result, recent studies have begun to investigate interactions between systems in the respiratory tract, often by using scRNA-seq20. Applications of scRNA-seq to young and aged mice have identified age-induced changes that occur at homeostasis21. Our lab and others have shown that aged immune cells drive a senescent phenotype in non-immune tissues22, that aged pulmonary epithelial cells recruit greater numbers of immune cells to the lung via excessive chemokine production post-IAV infection8, and that a subset of type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) promotes wound healing and tissue repair in the lung following IAV infection23. These findings, among several others20, all highlight the importance of crosstalk among immune, epithelial, and endothelial cells during infection. However, further work is needed to characterize these cell-cell interactions and how they may be disrupted in aged hosts following influenza infection.One particular avenue in need of further investigation is that of cellular localization. The ability of cells, particular immune cells, to mediate their functions and interact with other cell types is contingent upon their ability to appropriately localize to the region of interest. Fluorescence microscopy is a common technique for identifying cell-cell colocalization. However, new spatial sequencing techniques, such as the 10x Genomics Visium platform, offer the ability to identify cells and their gene expression profiles in situ at a resolution not previously possible, particularly when paired with scRNA-seq24,25,26. Spatial transcriptomics therefore offers a high throughput method to characterize changes in cellular localization and cell-cell interactions, thus allowing for the identification of novel pathways that may ultimately be targeted for therapeutic benefit.The aforementioned observations collectively suggest that immune-epithelial-endothelial crosstalk in the lung is critical during influenza virus infection, and that these interactions may be altered by aging. Improved understanding of these interactions will be critical for understanding the pathology of influenza virus infection and may have implications for the infection course of other respiratory viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2 and emerging respiratory viral pathogens. Therefore, we sought to utilize a combination of scRNA-seq, spatial sequencing, and bulk RNA-seq to generate a multifaceted, high-resolution atlas of young and aged lung tissue following influenza infection and identify key changes induced by aging in this clinically relevant setting.ResultsSingle-cell RNA sequencing reveals cellular heterogeneity among young and aged lungs post-influenza infectionIn order to investigate age-induced alterations in the host response to influenza A virus (IAV) infection, we infected groups of three young (16–18-week-old) and three aged (80–82-week-old) female C57Bl/6 mice intranasally with 50 PFU of the PR8 H1N1 variant of IAV. Lungs were harvested on day 3 or day 9 post-infection and processed for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), Visium spatial sequencing, or bulk RNA sequencing (bulk RNA-seq) (Fig. 1A, Supplemental Fig. 1A, B, and Methods). We also used the R package Seurat to integrate27,28 our 12 scRNA-seq samples with published scRNA-seq data from naïve, uninfected young and aged mice29. After integrating all 12 samples (day 0, day 3, and day 9 post-infection) and performing quality control to exclude doublets and dead cells, we were left with 82,079 cells that formed 33 clusters using uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) visualization (Fig. 1B). We used this combined scRNA-seq dataset for all further analyses unless otherwise specified. As we performed scRNA-seq on all cells in the lung, we found clusters consisting of immune cells, epithelial and stromal cells, and endothelial cells. To identify each cluster, we constructed a dot plot of key marker genes for these various cell types based on published scRNA-seq data17,18,19,29,30 (Fig. 1C). We then used a bar plot to quantify relative frequencies of these clusters between young and aged mice pooled from all timepoints (Fig. 1D and Supplemental Table 1).Fig. 1: Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals cellular heterogeneity among young and aged lungs post-influenza infection.A Schematic of experimental design.

F Violin plot showing module scores of the Reactome Cellular Senescence gene set (GSEA systematic name M27188). Horizontal lines denote mean values. Statistical testing was performed using the two-sided Wilcoxon test without multiple comparison correction. Data in (B–F) are pooled from all scRNA-seq data (day 0, day 3, and day 9). See also Supplemental Table 1.Full size imageAging is known to be associated with senescence, a cellular state marked by lack of proliferation and resistance to apoptosis31. To examine whether our data was able to capture these changes, we examined global expression of Cdkn1a, which encodes the senescence marker p2132. As might be expected, we found that cells pooled all timepoints of scRNA-seq data from the lungs of aged mice expressed significantly higher levels of Cdkn1a than did those of young mice pooled from all timepoints (Fig. 1E). To verify this, we wanted to use several markers rather than simply one to determine the degree of cellular senescence. As such, we calculated module scores of the Reactome Cellular Senescence gene set (GSEA systematic name M27188). Leveraging over 100 senescence markers, we once again found that aged mice expressed significantly higher levels of genes in this gene set than young mice (Fig. 1F). Collectively, these preliminary analyses demonstrated the power afforded by scRNA-seq in conjunction with kinetically staggered samples to identify age-induced and temporal changes in various cell types in the lung in response to influenza infection.Spatial sequencing allows for topological analysis of cellular and systemic processes altered by agingIt is understood that localization of cells plays an important role in regulating cell-cell interactions in both physiological and pathological processes. Although traditional spatial visualization methods such as immunohistochemistry or fluorescence microscopy allow for identification of proteins, they are limited in the number of markers that can be concomitantly detected in a given tissue section and these markers must be chosen a priori. Therefore, we opted to use the 10x Genomics Visium spatial RNA sequencing platform to generate high throughput transcriptomic captures of lungs from young and aged mice at day 0 (naïve), day 3, and day 9 post-infection with PR8 IAV (Fig. 1A). Visium slides allow for simultaneous viewing of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained histology (Supplemental Fig. 2A) as well as 55 micron diameter capture spots of pooled captured mRNA (Supplemental Fig. 2B–D). These capture spots are individually barcoded, allowing us to identify putative cell types based on mRNA expression within each spot across the tissue section. Similar to scRNA-seq, in which dimensionality reduction is used to cluster individual cells, we used UMAP visualization to visualize and cluster 15,026 individual capture spots from all six lung samples (Fig. 2A). Using key markers, we were able to identify the major cell type in each cluster (Fig. 2B): pneumocytes, immune cells, smooth muscle, epithelial cells, red blood cells (RBCs), fibroblasts, endothelial cells, neutrophils, mesothelial cells, and platelets. Notably, the 55 micron resolution afforded by Visium spatial sequencing does not allow for single-cell resolution. As a result, each of our spatial sequencing clusters tended to express low levels of markers of other clusters in addition to their own respective key marker; for example the immune cell cluster most strongly expressed Ptprc (encodes CD45), but many of the capture spots in this cluster also expressed Sftpa1 (encodes surfactant protein A1, which is produced by type 2 pneumocytes (AT2 cells)) (Fig. 2B). This stands in contrast to our scRNA-seq data, in which most marker genes were uniquely expressed by their respective clusters (Fig. 1C). To improve on the multicellular resolution available with Visium, we used the SPOTlight package in R to predict the cellular composition of each Visium spot using our scRNA-seq data as a reference. 33. SPOTlight generated a pie chart from each spot of our Visium capture spots, allowing us to later correlate putative locations of specific cell types with other parameters captured by our spatial sequencing data (Supplemental Fig. 2B–D).Fig. 2: Spatial sequencing allows for topological analysis of cellular and systemic processes altered by aging.A UMAP plot of Visium data, with each of 10 clusters labeled.

Statistical testing was performed using a two-sided t-test without multiple comparison correction.Full size imageTo demonstrate the enormous analytical power afforded by spatial sequencing, we used module scores to identify upregulation of key biological processes in a cell type-agnostic spatial manner. We began by visualizing module scores of the Hallmark Inflammatory Response gene set (GSEA systematic name M5932) as a way to identify where inflammation occurred in each lung tissue section (Fig. 2C). As expected, inflammation was low in naïve lungs but increased at day 3 and dramatically increased at day 9 post-infection. We also quantified the inflammation module score in each tissue section and found a significant increase in inflammation in aged lungs compared to young lungs at all three timepoints (Supplemental Fig. 2E). This agrees with prior observations that aged mice tend to have increased inflammatory responses during influenza infection10. This increased level of inflammation is also known to occur at baseline before pathogen challenge, a condition referred to as inflammaging34. Given that aged mice undergo greater tissue fibrosis following IAV infection compared to young mice14, we also checked scores of the WP Lung Fibrosis gene set (GSEA systematic name M39477) in our spatial sequencing data (Fig. 2D). As with inflammation, fibrosis scores were highest on day 9 post-infection and were consistently and significantly elevated in aged mice (Supplemental Fig. 2F). It was also apparent that the center-left section of the aged day 9 lung tissue section scored highly for both inflammation and fibrosis gene sets, a topological correlation that would be impossible to detect by bulk RNA-seq or scRNA-seq. To quantify this, we performed a linear regression analysis between the inflammation and fibrosis gene sets in the lungs of young and aged mice at day 9 post-IAV infection (Fig. 2E); in this analysis, each point represented one capture spot from these two tissue sections. We found a strong and significant positive correlation between inflammation and fibrosis module scores on a per-capture spot basis in aged lung tissue. In contrast, young lung tissue had a very weak negative correlation between inflammation and fibrosis. These data suggest that inflammation promotes fibrosis in the lungs of aged mice during IAV infection, whereas young mice are able to prevent the development of fibrosis in inflamed regions.Neutrophils in aged mice exhibit altered tissue localization and chemotactic gene expressionNeutrophils mediate inflammation in a variety of pathophysiological processes and are known to drive age-associated mortality following IAV infection8. Given this, we turned to our scRNA-seq data to identify temporal and age-related changes in the neutrophil population during IAV infection (Supplemental Fig. 3A). We noticed that genes encoding neutrophil granule proteins such as Ltf (lactotransferrin), Camp (cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide), and Ngp (neutrophilic granule protein) were all expressed at significantly higher levels pre-infection in young neutrophils compared to aged neutrophils. However, aged neutrophils did upregulate the proinflammatory gene Il1b (encodes IL-1β) at baseline. At day 3 post-infection, young and aged neutrophils expressed similar levels of Il1b, but young neutrophils expressed higher levels of Il1a; the chemokines Ccl3, Cxcl3, and Cxcl1; and Cd274 (encodes PD-L1). Neutrophils from mice of both age groups also upregulated common genes at this timepoint such as Bcl2a1b (encodes the anti-apoptotic protein BCL-2 A1)35, Traf1, and Sod2 (encodes superoxide dismutase 2).As gene expression analysis suggested that pro-inflammatory genes are differentially expressed between young and aged neutrophils at different timepoints post-infection, we quantified these functional changes using module scores. The inflammatory module score was significantly higher in aged neutrophils at baseline but lower or comparable in aged neutrophils following infection (Supplemental Fig. 3B). Collectively, these trends suggested that neutrophils from aged mice may have impaired inflammatory function on a per cell basis. Although this initially seemed to contradict aforementioned data that aged mice undergo increased inflammation during IAV infection (Fig. 2C and Supplemental Fig. 2E)10, we reasoned that neutrophils in aged mice could make up for inflammatory quality with cellular quantity, as has been demonstrated previously8.As chemokine signaling is known to play a major role in neutrophil recruitment to the inflamed lung during influenza infection, especially via CXCL2-CXCR2 interactions36, we turned our attention to the impact of aging on neutrophil chemotaxis. We used the R package CellChat37 to predict CXCL chemokine signaling to neutrophils from all cell populations found in our scRNA-seq data. At day 3 post-infection, young neutrophils were consistently predicted to experience significantly higher CXCL chemokine signaling than their aged counterparts (Supplemental Fig. 3A), with chemokine ligands predicted to be produced by a variety of immune and nonimmune cell types including alveolar macrophages, endothelial cells, matrix fibroblasts, and neutrophils themselves. However, these trends were sharply reversed on day 9 post-infection, with aged neutrophils predicted to experience significantly higher CXCL chemokine signaling than young neutrophils in almost all cell-cell interactions (Fig. 3A). Even at this timepoint, there was an interaction predicted between CXCL2 produced by neutrophils and CXCR2 on neutrophils. We quantified Cxcl2 gene expression by neutrophils using a violin plot and accordingly found that levels of this gene were highest on day 3 post-infection with young neutrophils expressing Cxcl2 at significantly higher levels than aged neutrophils (Supplemental Fig. 3D). Levels of this gene decreased in both age groups by day 9 post-infection, although less so in aged neutrophils, leading to aged neutrophils expressing significantly higher Cxcl2 than their young counterparts on day 9 post-infection. Taken together, these data suggest that neutrophils are recruited to the lungs in both young and aged mice early in IAV infection but that they tend to remain in the lungs of aged mice later in the course of infection, potentially allowing them to mediate pathological inflammation. We therefore performed flow cytometry to quantify neutrophils in the lungs of young and aged mice, but found no significant difference in neutrophil frequency on either day 3 or day 9 post-infection (Supplemental Fig. 3E–F). However, we wondered whether the tissue dissociation necessary for flow cytometry may be obscuring important information about neutrophil tissue distribution. We therefore turned to our SPOTlight-deconvoluted Visium data. We classified each capture area of our tissue sections into vascular and parenchymal regions based on the presence of at least 20% vascular cells (endothelial cells, Car4+ endothelial cells, or Vwf+ endothelial cells) predicted per capture spot (Fig. 3D). We then compared the distribution of neutrophils between vascular and parenchymal regions on day 9 post-infection and found that neutrophils in aged lungs were significantly more likely to appear in parenchymal regions compared to neutrophils in young lungs (Fig. 3E), suggesting that aging promotes increased parenchymal tissue infiltration by neutrophils, which may then drive lung damage, especially later in the infection course. In support of this hypothesis, previous experiments have shown that antibody-mediated ablation of neutrophils at day 6 post-IAV infection reduces mortality in aged mice, whereas depleting these cells early in infection worsens mortality8.Fig. 3: Neutrophils in aged mice exhibit altered chemotactic gene expression and tissue localization.A Dot plot showing predicted interactions between CXC chemokine ligands produced by cells labeled on the x-axis and CXC chemokine receptors located on neutrophils at day 9 post-infection.

We began by separately clustering CD4 and CD8 T cells pooled from all timepoints to identify more granular lymphocyte populations (Fig. 4A, B). By doing so, we found populations of naïve cells, effector cells, and memory precursor cells (MPCs) in both the CD8 and CD4 T cell compartments based on key transcriptional markers (Fig. 4C, D). In particular, we defined naive T cells based on low expression of Cd44, MPC T cells on high expression of Cd44 and Il7r, and effector T cells on high expression of Cd44 and effector genes such as Bhlhe40 and Gzmb (Fig. 4C, D). Although many key marker genes were expressed uniquely in each cluster, we noticed stark differences in expression of key T cell genes by young and aged T cells.Fig. 4: Lymphocytes from aged mice exhibit characteristics of altered effector function and memory formation.A, B UMAP plots of CD8 (A) and CD4 (B) T cells from day 3 and day 9 post-infection.

Statistical testing was performed using a two-sided two-sample t-test. Flow cytometry data are pooled from two independent experiments. In (F), n = 2 young mice per experiment; otherwise, n = 3 mice per age group per experiment. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageIn particular, aged naive CD8 T cells had higher expression of certain markers of naive and memory-like cells such as Il7r but lower expression of other such markers, including Bach2 and Tcf7 (encodes TCF-1), compared to young naive CD8 T cells (Fig. 4C). Similar differences were observed in young and aged MPC CD8 T cells, likely a result of the similar genetic and epigenetic characteristics of naive, MPC, and memory CD8 T cells40. However, there were more unique changes in the gene expression profiles of young and aged effector CD8 T cells. Young effector CD8 T cells had higher expression of genes encoding cytolytic proteins, such as Gzma and Gzmb (encode granzymes). Conversely, aged effector CD8 T cells had higher expression of genes related to persistent T cell stimulation, T cell exhaustion, and apoptosis, including Tox, Eomes, and Casp3 (encodes caspase 3). Interestingly, many of these genes were also upregulated in aged MPC and naive CD8 T cells relative to their young counterparts, although to a lesser degree than observed in aged effector CD8 T cells (Fig. 4C).Similarly, CD4 T cell subsets also appeared to have differential gene expression based on age (Fig. 4D). Like aged effector CD8 T cells, aged effector CD4 T cells also had higher expression of genes involved in persistent T cell activation, exhaustion, and apoptosis, including Tox and Casp4 (encodes caspase 4), compared to young effector CD4 T cells. Related genes, such as Pdcd1 and Nr4a2, were also expressed at higher levels by aged compared to young MPC CD4 T cells. Aged MPC CD4 T cells also had much higher expression of genes downstream of type I interferon (IFN) signaling, such as Stat1 and Irf7. Interestingly, we recently demonstrated that type I IFN signaling is a key signature of chronic viral infections compared to acute viral infections in both CD4 T cells41 and CD8 T cells42. Indeed, several markers of T cell exhaustion were upregulated in aged MPC and effector CD4 and CD8 T cells compared to their young counterparts, suggesting that aging causes dysregulation of key cytolytic and memory functions in both CD4 and CD8 T cells.To determine whether these alterations in gene expression were accompanied by changes in cellular frequencies, we used flow cytometry to quantify CD4 and CD8 T cells in young and aged mice. On day 3 post-IAV infection, we observed no differences in the frequency of CD8 T cells between young and aged mice, but we did observe a significantly reduced frequency of CD4 T cells in aged mice versus young mice (Fig. 4E, F). We found the same pattern at day 9 post-infection, with only aged CD4 T cells, but not CD8 T cells, having reduced frequencies compared to young cells (Fig. 4G, H). This agrees with previously published data demonstrating that aged mice mount a delayed CD4 T cell response to influenza infection compared to young mice43. We found that this change appears to be due to a selective reduction in the frequency of naive CD4 T cells in aged mice (Supplemental Fig. 4A–D), in line with known reductions in naive T cell numbers with age as a result of thymic involution44. Interestingly, we observed that activated (CD44+) CD4 T cells were significantly increased in frequency in aged mice compared to young mice on day 3 but not day 9 post-infection (Supplemental Fig. 4B, D).We also examined B lymphocytes as antibody responses are critical for anti-IAV immune responses45. Using flow cytometry, we observed no differences in the frequency of B cells between young and aged mice on day 3 post-IAV infection (Supplemental Fig. 4E) but did notice a significant increase in the frequency of B cells in aged mice on day 9 post-infection (Supplemental Fig. 4E). We then used our scRNA-seq data to identify genes differentially expressed by age group and time in both naïve B cells (Supplemental Fig. 4I) and plasma cells (Supplemental Fig. 4J). Of note, Prdm1 (encodes Blimp1), which enables plasma cell antibody secretion46, was upregulated in aged mice compared to young mice at all three timepoints studied in both naïve B cells and plasma cells. No significant differences between young and aged mice were found at any timepoint in the expression of Irf447,48,49 or Xbp150, both of which are required for plasma cell differentiation. Conversely, Bach2, which encodes a basic region-leucine zipper (bZip) transcription factor (TF) that prevents plasma cell formation from naïve B cells by inhibiting the expression of Blimp151, was found to be significantly upregulated in young plasma cells on day 3 post-infection (Supplemental Fig. 4J). In addition, we found that Pax5, a master regulator of B cell development whose expression is maintained in memory B cells but lost in plasma cells52,53,54, was upregulated in young naïve B cells at day 3 and day 9 post-infection and in young plasma cells at day 3 post-infection (Supplemental Fig. 4I-J). Given that activated B cells ultimately undergo a cell fate decision by differentiating into either plasma cells or memory B cells55, these altered patterns of gene expression suggested that aging may impact the propensity of B cells to develop into plasma cells or memory B cells. We therefore plotted module scores of a gene set upregulated in plasma cells versus memory B cells (GSEA systematic name M3253)56 and found that it was significantly upregulated in aged naïve B cells and plasma cells compared to their young counterparts at all time points (Supplemental Fig. 4K), suggesting that aged B cells may be biased to differentiate into plasma cells rather than memory B cells.Finally, our analyses also emphasized the possibility of aging impacting the function of genes and proteins that have been previously studied without considering age as a variable. For example, we noticed that aged plasma cells upregulated Ptpn22 (Supplemental Fig. 4J), which encodes Lyp, a phosphatase that inhibits TCR and BCR signaling and is able to impose B cell tolerance in autoimmune disorders such as type 1 diabetes57,58,59. Animal studies conducted on this critical mediator of immune responses have predominantly used relatively young mice (<12 weeks of age), as is standard for most experiments. However, our data suggest that it may be prudent to examine the impact of aging on the function of Lyp and other immunomodulatory proteins. Our data collectively provide insights into aging-induced changes in T and B lymphocytes following influenza infection and may therefore be a useful resource for identifying new pathways in these cells to target for further study.Aged endothelial cells exhibit altered localization to fibrotic sites and increased coagulationOur initial scRNA-seq analysis identified three populations of non-lymphatic endothelial cells in the lung: conventional endothelial cells (ECs), which likely comprise microvasculature; Vwf+ ECs, which are likely macrovascular cells;17 and Car4+ ECs, which were recently identified as being important for vascular regeneration following lung injury17,18. We chose to focus on Car4+ ECs, as these as are a novel population with direct relevance to lung injury, and conventional ECs, as vascular injury during respiratory viral infection typically affects capillaries rather than large vessels60. Although the initial studies identifying Car4+ ECs used scRNA-seq to categorize this population, they were performed in young mice; we therefore began our analysis by identifying genes differentially expressed between conventional and Car4+ ECs at different timepoints post-infection and in young and aged mice (Supplemental Fig. 5A). As expected, Car4+ ECs had unique markers compared to conventional ECs such as Car4, Ednrb (encodes endothelin receptor B), and Kdr (encodes VEGFR-2). In addition, Car4+ ECs expressed Cd34 and Tbx2, which is expressed by stem-like mesenchymal progenitor cells but downregulated in terminally differentiated endothelial cells61, underlining the stem-like nature of Car4+ ECs. Interestingly, these two genes were expressed at lower levels in Car4+ ECs at homeostasis but were upregulated following infection, whereas the related T-box TF Tbx3 was consistently expressed at high levels at all time points (Supplemental Fig. 5A). Conversely, conventional ECs expressed Cxcl12, which may serve to recruit monocytes to sites of inflammation via CXCR4-mediated chemotaxis62, and Kit (encodes c-Kit), which is expressed on progenitor-like ECs recruited to sites of endothelial inflammation for vascular regeneration63.Given differential expression in terms of genes regulating vascular regeneration, we applied a module score of the GO Vascular Wound Healing gene set (GSEA systematic name M29158) to conventional and Car4+ ECs. Interestingly, aged conventional ECs exhibited comparable or significantly reduced vascular wound healing scores at all timepoints (Fig. 5A), whereas there was no significant difference between young and aged Car4+ ECs at any age (Supplemental Fig. 5B). We then turned to our Visium data to determine if there were spatial differences between young and aged Car4+ ECs, with a focus on fibrotic regions as these cells have been found to localize to regions of tissue damage17. Indeed, spatial sequencing identified a significant positive correlation between Car4+ EC frequency per capture spot and the fibrosis module score (Supplemental Fig. 2F) in young lungs and a significant negative correlation between these variables in aged lungs at day 9 post-infection (Fig. 5B-C). This observation suggests that localization of Car4+ ECs to sites of tissue damage may be impaired in aged mice.Fig. 5: Aged endothelial cells exhibit altered localization to fibrotic sites and increased coagulation.A Violin plot showing module scores of a vascular wound healing gene set (GSEA systematic name M29158) in endothelial cells (ECs).

Horizontal lines denote mean values. Statistical testing was performed using a two-sided Wilcoxon test without multiple comparison correction (A–D) or two-sided t-test without multiple comparison correction (C).Full size imageOur analyses have previously shown increased inflammation in the lungs of aged mice compared to young mice (Fig. 2C, Supplemental Fig. 2E); therefore, it was unsurprising that aged Car4+ ECs significantly upregulated Gdf15, a TGF-β family member and marker of inflammatory stress in lung damage and other pathological states64, post-infection compared to both young Car4+ ECs and conventional ECs (Supplemental Fig. 5A, C). More broadly, aged Car4+ ECs had significantly higher module scores of the Hallmark Inflammatory Response gene set (GSEA systematic name M5932) than young Car4+ ECs on day 9 post-infection (Supplemental Fig. 5D). As inflammation is a key trigger of endothelial cell activation and coagulation65, we calculated module scores of the Hallmark Coagulation gene set (GSEA systematic name M5946) in ECs (Supplemental Fig. 5E) and Car4+ ECs (Fig. 5D). Neither cell type exhibited an age-related difference pre-infection, but both aged ECs and aged Car4+ ECs had significantly higher coagulation module scores at day 3 and day 9 post-infection than their respective young counterparts. Thus, scRNA-seq and spatial sequencing analyses collectively suggested that Car4+ ECs have impaired localization to sites of tissue damage with age and that aged lungs are prone to endothelial injury, which may lead to increased risk of thrombosis with age during respiratory viral infection. These findings are particularly of interest in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, as SARS-CoV-2 infection is prone to cause more severe infection in the elderly and has been associated with the development of pulmonary thrombosis66.Spatial sequencing reveals pro- and anti-fibrotic genes differentially expressed by immune and nonimmune cellsAs we found a novel spatial correlation between Car4+ ECs and tissue fibrosis (Fig. 5B, C), we chose to further investigate the spatial relationship between pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis using their respective module scores (Fig. 2B, D). Using the mean value of each module score as a binary cutoff, we grouped spatial capture spots from our day 9 aged lung sample, which had the highest average fibrosis module score (Supplemental Fig. 2F), into three categories: uninflamed, inflamed fibrotic, and inflamed nonfibrotic (Fig. 6A). We then performed differential expression analysis to identify genes upregulated in each category (Fig. 6B). Some genes, such as Il1b, Isg15 (encodes interferon-stimulated gene 15), Gzmb (encodes granzyme b), Cd8a, and Tgfb1 (encodes TGF-β1) were expectedly enriched in inflamed fibrotic regions as these genes encode markers of inflammation and T cell-mediated cytolysis as well as a pro-fibrotic cytokine.Fig. 6: Spatial sequencing reveals pro- and anti-fibrotic genes differentially expressed by immune and nonimmune cells.A Spatial feature plot of aged lung tissue from day 9 post-infection.

See also Supplemental Table 2.Full size imageInflamed fibrotic regions also upregulated Wfdc17 (encodes AMWAP), which has previously been shown to skew myeloid cells from a pro-inflammatory to a suppressive phenotype characterized by increased Arg1 (encodes arginase) expression;67 in accordance with these data, we also found that Arg1 was significantly enriched in inflamed fibrotic regions (Fig. 6B) and that Wfdc17 was selectively expressed by myeloid cells in our scRNA-seq data (Fig. 6C). Furthermore, Wfdc17 expression tended to be significantly enriched in myeloid cells from aged mice, although expression kinetics varied by specific cell type (Supplemental Fig. 6A–D). These analyses suggest that Wfdc17 is upregulated by myeloid cells in an attempt to reduce inflammation; however, myeloid skewing towards an anti-inflammatory or myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) phenotype, characterized by arginase expression68, may also promote fibrosis69, particularly in aged mice.We also found several genes that were upregulated in inflamed nonfibrotic and uninflamed regions (Fig. 6B). Prss23 encodes a protease known to cleave collagen and inhibit fibrosis in renal tissue70, although its role in lung fibrosis has not yet been investigated. Hpgd encodes hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase, an enzyme that degrades proinflammatory prostaglandins (PGEs) such as PGE2. As PGE2 may prevent lung fibrosis by downregulating TGF-β production in IPF, HPGD has been shown to promote fibrosis in bleomycin models of IPF71,72. However, the role of PGE2 in influenza infection is still contested73, suggesting that further investigation of the roles of PGE2 and HPGD in IAV, particularly in the context of aging, may be warranted. Calcrl encodes the calcitonin receptor like-receptor (CRLR) that mediates adrenomedullin signaling, which has been found to reduce bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis74. Interestingly, genes related to caveolae formation, such as Cav1 (encodes caveolin 1), Cavin2 (encodes SDPR), and Ehd2 were all enriched in these regions as well (Fig. 6B). Caveolin 1 has been found to prevent bleomycin-induced fibrosis by inhibiting inflammasome activation75,76, although the roles of Cavin2 and Ehd2 in pulmonary fibrosis are not well-defined. We also found significantly elevated expression of Wfdc2 (encodes HE4) in uninflamed regions (Fig. 6B); HE4 is a protease inhibitor that non-covalently binds to PRSS23 to inhibit collagen breakdown in models of renal fibrosis70. Given the unusual spatial distribution of expression of Wfdc2, its role in fibrosis post-IAV infection may be nuanced.We then examined expression of these genes by cell type using our scRNA-seq data (Fig. 6C). Prss23 and Ehd2 were expressed by both endothelial and epithelial cells; Hpgd and Calcrl primarily by endothelial cells; Cav1 and Cavin2 by a mix of endothelial and epithelial cells; and Wfdc2 by non-fibroblast epithelial cells including AT1, AT2, club, ciliated, and goblet cells. These data suggest that various immune, epithelial, and endothelial cells interact in the lung to either promote or prevent fibrosis following respiratory viral infection. Age-induced dysregulation of these interactions therefore may bias the lungs to a pro-fibrotic state rather than normal wound healing after injury.Finally, we returned to our spatial sequencing data to identify which cell types may be enriched in fibrotic areas of the lung. To do so, we deconvoluted our aged day 9 lung sample using SPOTlight (Supplemental Fig. 2D) and calculated the average predicted cellular composition of inflamed fibrotic, inflamed nonfibrotic, and uninflamed capture spots (Fig. 6D and Supplemental Table 2). By highlighting which region each cell type was enriched in, we identified several interesting trends that paralleled our differential gene expression analysis. Notably, cells that expressed high amounts of antifibrotic Prss23 by scRNA-seq, such as lymphatic endothelial cells and mesothelial cells, were predicted to be enriched in inflamed nonfibrotic and uninflamed regions (Fig. 6C, D). The notable exception to this was matrix fibroblasts, which were unsurprisingly enriched in inflamed fibrotic regions as these cells produce collagen to induce fibrosis30,77. Similarly, cell types expressing high levels of Wfdc2, such as AT2 cells, ciliated cells, club cells, and goblet cells were all predicted to be enriched in uninflamed regions. Conversely, cells with high expression of Wfdc17, such as monocytes, conventional dendritic cells (cDCs), and interstitial macrophages, were predicted to be enriched in inflamed fibrotic regions (Fig. 6D). These analyses demonstrate the unique insights afforded by spatial sequencing, particularly in conjunction with scRNA-seq data, for the discovery of novel transcriptomic and cellular mediators of pathophysiological processes following tissue injury, such as during influenza virus infection.Bulk RNA sequencing captures global kinetic and age-induced changes in IAV-infected lungsTo complete our analysis of aging-induced changes in the lung following IAV infection, we performed bulk RNA sequencing (bulk RNA-seq) on young and aged lungs from day 0, day 3, and day 9 post-PR8 IAV infection (Fig. 1A). We visualized samples using a principal component analysis (PCA) plot and observed that samples clustered by timepoint and age, with day 9 samples exhibiting more drastic changes than day 3 samples compared to baseline and aged samples exhibiting more heterogeneity than young samples (Supplemental Fig. 7A). To identify more specific changes, we constructed heatmaps of significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) identified between young and aged mice at each timepoint (Supplemental Fig. 7B–D). Markers of immune cells such as Ptprc (encodes CD45), Pdcd1, Ly6c2, and Cd14 were enriched in aged lungs at various timepoints. Markers of B cells (Cd19), T cells (Cd3g), and antigen presentation (Cd74 and Cd83) were elevated in aged lungs at day 3 post-infection. Genes encoding broader markers of inflammation such as complement proteins (C1qa, C1qb, and C1d), acute-phase proteins (Crp), and interferon-stimulated genes (Ifit1, Ifit3, Isg15, and Isg20) were also elevated in aged mice at various timepoints. Interestingly, members of the serpin (serine protease inhibitor) family were upregulated in aged mice across all timepoints (Supplemental Fig. 7B–D). Of particular interest were Serpina1a, Serpina1b, Serpina1c, and Serpina1d, which encode isoforms of alpha-1-antitrypsin (A1AT), a protease inhibitor which has been found to inhibit the degradation of elastin and collagen by neutrophils in the lung78. Elevated levels of serpins, especially A1AT, could therefore impair collagen breakdown in aged lungs, leading to increased pulmonary fibrosis following influenza infection (Fig. 2D and Supplemental Fig. 2F). In line with this, the profibrotic gene Wfdc17 (Fig. 6B) was also elevated in aged lungs at day 9 post-infection (Supplemental Fig. 7D). Finally, genes related to coagulation factors and platelets (F2 and Ppbp) were elevated in aged mice at baseline or day 9 post-infection.We then performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) using the Reactome database to identify pathways significantly enriched between young and aged mice at each of the three different timepoints to provide a broad overview of transcriptomic changes in the lung (Fig. 7A). Some pathways, such as collagen chain trimerization were exclusively enriched in young lungs at multiple timepoints. Others were initially enriched in aged lungs but then become enriched in young mice, such as mitotic prophase and DNA repair. Finally, some pathways were consistently enriched in aged lungs including complement cascade; chemokine signaling; necrosis; and several pathways involved in coagulation such as platelet P2Y12 receptor signaling, fibrin clot formation, platelet activation, and platelet aggregation. This supports scRNA-seq module score analyses, which showed elevated coagulation gene sets in multiple endothelial cell populations (Fig. 5D and Supplemental Fig. 5E). We also performed GSEA using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database (Fig. 7B). KEGG results were similar to Reactome results, with apoptosis, chemokine signaling, and cytokine signaling all enriched in aged lungs at different timepoints. Notably, the fatty acid metabolism and PPAR signaling pathways were also enriched in aged lungs. Although global PPARγ expression has been found to be reduced in obese mice post-IAV infection79, the role of this signaling pathway requires further investigation in the context of aging and IAV infection, where it may be elevated in aged mice compared to young mice. Collectively, pathway analyses suggest that aged mice may be more prone to pulmonary inflammation, thrombosis, and tissue damage following influenza infection compared to young mice. These detrimental outcomes may be the ultimate result of impaired cellular localization, function, and phenotype due to age-mediated alterations in immune-endothelial-epithelial interactions in the lung following respiratory viral infection.Fig. 7: Bulk RNA sequencing captures global kinetic and age-induced changes in IAV-infected lungs.A Dot plot showing Reactome pathways enriched in young (normalized enrichment score (NES) < 0) or aged (NES > 0) lungs at day 0, day 3, or day 9 post-infection.

Our analyses revealed drastic changes in gene expression patterns in various immune, endothelial, and epithelial cell types. Moreover, we found that cell-cell interactions, cellular localization, and systemic processes were altered in the lungs by aging. These changes paint a broad picture of increased inflammation, fibrosis, and coagulation as well as reduced vascular wound healing in the aged lung following influenza infection.By performing scRNA-seq in duplicate on young and aged lungs at 3 and 9 days post-influenza infection, we were able to identify age-induced changes in the host response to infection. In addition, we integrated our data with publicly available scRNA-seq data from lungs of naïve young and aged mice29, thus allowing us to compare cellular changes between pre- and post-infection states. This data set by Angelidis et al. also uses young and aged mice on the C57BL/6 genetic background, and tissue collection and dissociation was done in a similar manner to our experimental protocols. Utilizing available data from naïve mice allowed us to make temporal comparisons over the course of infection. Notably, our approach of sequencing all cell types in the lung enabled a broad overview of interactions among various immune, endothelial, and epithelial cells. Our scRNA-seq analysis identified 33 clusters of cells; however, the cellular landscape of the lung is far more heterogeneous than this, and this increased heterogeneity can be identified by either increasing the resolution of the clustering algorithm or selecting subsets of the data and reclustering cells if desired. Our aim in compiling these data is to enable other groups to utilize them to study cell populations of interest, and focusing on specific cells and increasing the cluster granularity may help individual groups with this goal. One limitation to our approach is that frequencies of cells cannot be directly compared between timepoints. Our day 9 samples had to be FACS sorted in order to enrich non-immune populations, thus preventing direct comparisons to day 0 and day 3 samples. However, comparisons can still be made between young and aged mice at each timepoint, as samples from any given timepoint were subject to the same experimental design. Another limitation to our analysis that must be acknowledged pertains to our use of publicly available naïve data29 to combine with our scRNA-seq data: the mice in this public data set were 12 and 96 weeks old whereas we used mice that were 16–18 weeks old and 80–82 weeks old. However, these differences in age are relatively minor and would not dramatically impact response to infection. Finally, it must be noted that influenza infection heterogeneously affects different anatomical regions of the lung. Since we consistently sampled the left lung to minimize variability between samples, our spatial transcriptomics data may not fully capture infection heterogeneity in the lungs.Our spatial sequencing analysis provided a novel perspective on the spatial differences between IAV-infected lungs of young and aged mice. Although the resolution of the 10x Visium platform is currently limited to 55 microns, and is therefore not capable of directly providing single-cell information, we were able to use the SPOTlight algorithm33 to deconvolute spatial sequencing data using our scRNA-seq data. Although we chose to use SPOTlight for our analyses, there are multiple software packages available in different programming languages for spatial transcriptomics deconvolution, including cell2location80, Stereoscope81, and RCTD82. We readily identified increased levels of inflammation and fibrosis in the lungs of aged mice using spatial sequencing. Notably, aged mice had significantly elevated levels of inflammation module scores pre-infection. This baseline increase in inflammation, often referred to as inflammaging34, is a major driver of age-related pathophysiological changes. Some have argued that inflammaging is not only driven intrinsically by aging but is also accelerated by recurrent bouts of infection and inflammation83. This provides one extrinsic mechanism by which aged organisms, which will statistically tend to have a greater history of antigen exposure than young organisms, may have exacerbated dysregulation of the inflammatory response. In line with this model, our spatial sequencing data suggested that aged lungs have a striking correlation between inflamed and fibrotic regions not present in young lungs, further showing that aging impairs the ability to regulate inflammation, which may then cause increased collagen deposition and subsequent fibrosis14,84.When investigating the innate immune system, we used CellChat receptor-ligand analysis and spatial transcriptomics-based location analysis to determine that chemotaxis of neutrophils into the lung parenchyma from the vasculature is likely increased in aged mice compared to young mice at day 9 post-infection, with increased chemokine signaling likely mediating this phenomenon. Previous work has shown that neutrophil infiltration of the lung during the later stages of IAV infection is selectively detrimental to aged mice and that this process is driven by increased CXCL chemokine production by lung epithelial cells8. Our work confirms these observations; identifies previously unconsidered chemokine-receptor interactions, such as CXCL12-CXCR4 and PPBP-CXCR2 interactions, that may mediate this migration; and demonstrates that spatial transcriptomics can be used to identify location-based cellular data that may be lost upon tissue dissociation for scRNA-seq or flow cytometry. Finally, our bulk RNA-seq analysis identified significantly increased expression of Serpina1a (encodes alpha-1-antitrypsin, A1AT) and other serpin genes in aged lungs, similar to previous findings that A1AT protein levels are increased in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples from healthy aged human donors85. A1AT inhibits the breakdown of elastin and collagen by neutrophils in the lung78, thus increasing fibrosis, so increased levels of A1AT may provide an indirect mechanism for neutrophils in aged hosts to contribute to lung damage post-IAV infection.Concerning the adaptive immune system, scRNA-seq analysis of lymphocytes revealed increased inflammatory activity in the CD4 T cell compartment and altered memory gene expression in the CD4 T cell, CD8 T cell, and B cell pools. Our data suggest a reduction in memory potential in aged CD4 T cells based on decreased expression of the key memory-associated gene Ccr786,87,88 and identify upregulation of genes associated with persistent T cell stimulation and exhaustion, such as Tox89,90,91,92,93 and Pdcd194, in multiple subsets of aged CD4 and CD8 T cells. We and others have shown that the T cell receptor (TCR) sequence and structure, and therefore the make of the T cell repertoire, is important for CD4 T cell fate in the context of acute viral infection88,95. However, it has been found that the CD4 T cell repertoire does not appear to contract with age for key influenza antigens43. On the other hand, it is known that H-2Db:NP366–374-specific CD8 T cells contract with age in mice13. Human studies have addressed this question at higher resolution by using single-cell T cell receptor sequencing (scTCR-seq) to show that older humans also have reduced antigen-specific CD8 T cells and that the CD8 T cell repertoire of older humans is biased toward private rather than public clonotypes6,7. It has also been found that CD8 resident memory T (TRM) cells from young IAV-infected mice have hierarchies of immunodominant antigen specificities in different portions of the respiratory tract96. Application of paired spatial sequencing and scTCR-seq to murine models of aging and influenza infection later in the disease course may therefore improve our understanding of how the CD8 T cell repertoire changes with age and how CD8 TRM cells develop post-infection or vaccination, as these cells are critical for prevention of reinfection96 but also promote lung fibrosis in aged mice14.Our analysis of B cells suggests that B cells in aged mice may have reduced memory potential and an increased plasmablast or plasma cell phenotype due to decreased expression of the plasma cell master regulator Prdm1 (encodes Blimp1)46 and reduced expression of Pax5, a B cell lineage regulating transcription factor whose expression is maintained in memory B cells but lost in plasma cells52,53,54. These observations align with human data showing a loss of memory B cells with age97,98 and alterations in memory B cell99,100,101 and plasma cell102 functionality following influenza vaccination in aged human subjects, including increased frequencies of PAX5lo atypical B cells103 and reduced protective antibody titers104. As antibody production is the first line of immune memory against recurrent infections or infections post-vaccination, studies of how influenza-specific B cell dynamics change with age may ultimately help improve influenza vaccine efficacy in the elderly. Application of single-cell B cell receptor sequencing (scBCR-seq) to young mice has shown that individual low- and high-affinity B cell clones can give rise to both memory and plasma cells;105 whether this holds true in aged mice is an unanswered but important question as bulk BCR-seq from humans has shown that elderly subjects have reduced IgH diversity pre- and post-influenza vaccination compared to young subjects106.Aging is known to correlate with an increased hypercoagulable state107. Our analysis of endothelial cells (ECs) shows that both conventional capillary ECs and recently discovered Car4+ ECs17,18 exhibit increased transcriptomic profiles of coagulation with age, particularly at day 9 post-infection. Clinical data have shown that patients with severe IAV infection have higher serum levels of D-dimer108 and that acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients with IAV infection are at higher risk of thrombosis compared to patients with ARDS induced by causes other than IAV infection109. Our data combine these two sets of observations and imply that changes in vascular phenotype and function may predispose the elderly to a greater risk of thrombotic events following influenza infection. As thrombosis can also occur following SARS-CoV-2 infection and the outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection worsen with age66,110,111, further studies investigating age-induced changes in vascular biology and hemostasis following respiratory viral infection may be prudent. Our spatial transcriptomics analyses suggest that Car4+ ECs may exhibit reduced vascular healing in aged mice due to impaired localization to sites of lung fibrosis. As the Car4+ EC population was discovered relatively recently, the impact of aging on the regenerative role of these cells in respiratory viral infections requires further study.Finally, we used spatial transcriptomics to identify novel potential regulators of post-IAV pulmonary fibrosis. Wfdc17 is enriched in fibrotic regions whereas caveolae-associated genes and Prss23 are enriched in nonfibrotic regions. Wfdc17 has been reported to play a role in skewing microglia towards an immunosuppressive phenotype67 and may therefore warrant further investigation in the context of pulmonary fibrosis. Prss23, by contrast, has an established role as an antifibrotic agent in the context of renal fibrosis but is again understudied in the context of respiratory viral infection70. The spatially enriched and cell type-specific expression of these genes may help improve our understanding of the cellular mediators of pulmonary fibrosis in the context of infection and aging. More generally, our identification of these genes serves as a proof of concept as to the ability of spatial transcriptomics to identify novel markers that may not be detected by conventional imaging methods or even scRNA-seq.Finally, our application of bulk RNA-seq to young and aged lung tissue identified global changes in gene expression as well as signaling pathways and pathophysiological processes. For example, we observed alterations in PPAR signaling pathways in the lungs of aged mice. PPAR family members are key regulators of free fatty acid (FFA) metabolism112. Obesity and its resultant increase in serum FFAs are also known to negatively impact morbidity and mortality following influenza113,114,115 and SARS-CoV-2116 infection. Aged hosts may also be predisposed to negative outcomes following respiratory viral infection due to metabolic dysfunction, although further studies will be needed to expand upon this observation and tease apart these two comorbidities mechanistically. Nonetheless, our current study provides a multifaceted transcriptomic atlas for public investigation of the impact of aging on influenza infection which may be useful to the broad scientific community for hypothesis generation. Moreover, our work demonstrates the immense power and unique discovery potential of paired scRNA-seq and spatial sequencing.Our study has inherent limitations, most notably that we primarily analyzed transcript-level changes in cellular function, which may not necessarily correlate to protein-level changes and ultimate phenotypic manifestations of disease. Furthermore, our work was done exclusively in female mice, and there are known sex differences in influenza infection in both humans and mice117. Finally, our work dissects the lungs at day 3 and day 9 post-IAV infection to investigate age-related changes during infection, but infection resolution and post-infectious lung damage and immune memory generation occur beyond these timepoints14. However, the work presented here is presented as a launching off point for other researchers to utilize these data and develop further experiments to address these limitations. As mentioned before, pairing scTCR-seq or scBCR-seq with spatial sequencing may allow for identification of changes in T cell and B cell clonal dynamics with age during influenza infection. In addition, performing high resolution spatial transcriptomics techniques would enable true single-cell spatial analyses, whereas our use of the Visium platform limits us to 55 micron capture spots and necessitates deconvolution using scRNA-seq data. Finally, new methods have bene developed that allow for spatial measurement of protein expression on a large scale, combining the advantages of fluorescence microscopy and spatial transcriptomics118.MethodsEthics StatementResearch for this manuscript complied with all relevant ethical regulations. Young (16–18-week-old) and aged (80–2-week-old) female C57Bl/6 J mice were purchased from Jackson. All mice were maintained under the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) of the Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW) (protocol AUA00003003). All animal experiments were performed under the guidelines of the Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) at MCW (protocol IBC20130979).Influenza infectionMice were infected with ~50 PFU of influenza A/PR8/34 (NCBI Taxonomy ID 211044) to establish acute infection. Infections were performed by intranasal (i.n.) administration under anesthesia as described before119.Tissue collectionFor scRNA-seq, mice were euthanized and the right ventricle was perfused with 10 mL cold DPBS (Corning). The lung lobes were cut into fine pieces and digested at 37 °C with collagenase IV (1 mg/mL; Worthington) for 40 min. The tissue pieces were further ground and homogenized in a 70 μm cell strainer. After spinning down, red blood cells were removed by addition of ACK lysis buffer (Lonza) for 10 min on ice. Cells were kept in 10% RPMI (Lonza) at all times.For Visium spatial sequencing, mice were euthanized and lungs were inflated with 500 μL of 50% v/v OCT/PBS (Fisher Healthcare) via an intratracheal catheter. The left lung was excised and the caudal half was placed in a cryomold containing OCT. The mold was frozen in an isopentane (Fisher Scientific) bath chilled by liquid nitrogen.For bulk RNA-seq, pieces of right lung were harvested after ventricular perfusion and snap frozen on dry ice.For flow cytometry, mice were euthanized and the right ventricle was perfused with 10 mL cold DPBS (Corning). Lungs were minced into fine pieces and placed into a 50 mL tube containing 20 mL of 1.3 mM EDTA in Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution, which was supplemented with 12 mg/mL HEPES sodium salt, 2.9 mg/mL L-glutamine powder, 0.2x penicillin-streptomycin solution, and 0.05 mg/mL gentamycin sulfate (1x HGPG). After shaking for 30 min at 37 °C, the 20 mL supernatant was carefully removed from the minced lung tissue and 25 mL of 1% FBS in cRPMI supplemented with 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 2500 units of collagenase I, and 1x HGPG was added to lung tissue. This was placed on a shaker for 60 min at 37 °C. The residual tissue was homogenized in a 70 μm cell strainer. The suspension was centrifuged for 10 min at 1500 rpm. Supernantant was removed and the cell pellet was suspended in 4 mL of 44% Percoll (in 1% cRPMI), and transferred to a 14 mL round bottom tube. Then, 2.5 mL of 67% Percoll (in PBS) was carefully underlaid, and this was centrifuged for 30 min at 1800 rpm at room temperature with no braking. Cells were pipetted out and red blood cell lysis was then performed.Cell sortingOnly day 9 post-infection samples were sorted for scRNA-seq to obtain a roughly equal proportion of immune and non-immune cells for analysis, although all samples were stained to examine the relative proportions of immune and non-immune cells. Single-cell suspensions were incubated with biotin-conjugated antibodies targeting the following Lineage markers for 30 min at 4 °C in 10% RPMI: CD3e, CD8a, TCRb, B220, NK1.1, Ly6C/G (anti-GR1), CD11b, CD11c, Ter119 (Biolegend). Samples were then washed twice in 10% RPMI and stained with Live/Dead Fixable Violet (ThermoFisher), streptavidin, and anti-CD90 for 30 min at 4 °C in 10% RPMI. Samples were then run on an Aria IIIu cell sorter (BD Biosciences).Flow cytometryLive/Dead cell staining was performed using Fixable Live Dead Blue (ThermoFisher) in PBS at 4 °C for 30 min in the dark. Cells were washed twice and surface panel was applied to cells, incubated at room temperature for 60 min in the dark. Cells were fixed using 1x TrueNuclear Fix (Biolegend), and intracellular transcription factor staining was performed using TrueNuclear Perm Buffer (Biolegend) at room temperature for 45 min in the dark. Cells were resuspended in FACS buffer prior to analysis by flow cytometry. Single color compensations and cellular flow cytometry were acquired and unmixed on a 5 laser spectral flow cytometer (Cytek Aurora). Data were analyzed using Cytobank Premium (Beckman Coulter). Antibodies and dilutions are listed in Supplemental Table 3.Single-cell RNA sequencing and analysisFor day 9 post-infection samples, single-cell suspensions of lung tissue were FACS sorted (see above), and Lin+ cells and Lin– cells from each sample were individually pooled at a 1:1 ratio. For day 3 post-infection samples, cells were not sorted as the ratio of Lin+:Lin– cells was ~1:1. Cells were loaded onto the Chromium Controller (10x Genomics), then the 10x Genomics 3’ v2 Reagent Kit (day 9 post-infection samples) or the 10x Genomics 3’ v3.1 Reagent Kit (day 3 post-infection samples) was used to generate cDNA libraries. Barcoded libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500 instrument using a NextSeq 500/550 High Output Kit v2 (150 cycles) (20024907, Illumina) with the following cycle counts: 28 (read 1), 8 (index), and 91 (read 2) (day 9 post-infection samples) or 28 (read 1), 10 (index 1), 10 (index 2), 90 (read 2) (day 3 post-infection samples). Data were demultiplexed and aligned to the mm10 2020-A reference transcriptome (10x Genomics) using Cell Ranger (v6.0, 10x Genomics). Analysis was performed in R using Seurat (v4.0)120, with tidyverse (v1.3.1) used for data organization121. Quality control was performed to exclude low quality cell, doublets, and dead cells; cells with >1000 unique genes (day 0 samples), >3500 unique genes (day 3 and day 9 samples), <200 unique genes (all samples), or >10% mitochondrial genes were excluded from the final analysis. Day 3 and day 9 post-infection samples collected by our lab were then integrated with publicly available day 0 data29 using Seurat integration pipeline. Gene set scoring was performed using Seurat’s AddModuleScore function with default settings for both scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics data. Receptor-ligand analysis was performed using CellChat (v1.1.3)37 with default settings.Bulk RNA sequencing and analysisMice were infected and lungs were inflated as described above. Small sections of the right lung were excised and snap frozen on dry ice. RNA was extracted using an RNAEasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). Reverse transcription was performed and the resultant cDNA was enzymatically fragmented and indexed using a Nextera XT DNA Library Preparation Kit (Illumina). Barcoded cDNA libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500 instrument using a NextSeq 500/550 High Output Kit v2 (75 cycles) (20024906, Illumina) with the following cycle counts: 37 (read 1), 8 (index 1), 8 (index 2), 37 (read 2). Demultiplexing was performed using bcl2fastq (v2.20, Illumina). Alignment was performed using Salmon (v1.4.0)122 and the GRCm39 reference genome (Ensembl) with default settings. Downstream analysis was performed in R using DESeq2 (v1.28.1)123.Visium spatial sequencing and analysis10 μm sections were generated from frozen inflated left lungs using a cryostat and placed on barcoded slides (10x Genomics). The Visium Spatial Gene Expression Slide & Reagent Kit (10x Genomics) was used to generate barcoded cDNA libraries. H&E stained tissues on Visium slides were imaged using a Nikon Eclipse Ti2 inverted microscope. Lung tissue on Visium slides was permeabilized for 14 min to extract mRNA. Barcoded cDNA libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500 instrument using a NextSeq 500/550 High Output Kit v2 (150 cycles) (20024907, Illumina) with the following cycle counts: 28 (read 1), 10 (index 1), 10 (index 2), 90 (read 2). Loupe Browser (v5.0, 10x Genomics) was used to identify which spatial sequencing capture area spots were in contact with tissue. Demultiplexing and alignment was performed with Space Ranger (v2.1, 10x Genomics) and the mm10 2020-A reference transcriptome (10x Genomics). Analysis was mainly performed in R using Seurat (v4.0). Visium datasets were integrated using the SCTransform pipeline, and PCA and UMAP were performed using the top 30 principal components. SPOTlight33 was used to demultiplex Visium data with our integrated scRNA-seq data used as a reference.Statistical analysisStatistical comparisons for sequencing data were performed in R. Pairwise comparisons were performed using a Wilcoxon test with Holm-Sidak correction through the ggpubr package. Linear regressions were performed using the lm function. CellChat analyses were performed using default parameters.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.

From: Animal and Plant Health Agency, Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs, Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, UK Research and Innovation and The Rt Hon Lord Benyon Published 20 October 2023 This was published under the 2022 to 2024 Sunak Conservative government Scientists have discovered Northern Gannets and Shag are showing signs of developing immunity to avian influenza in research published today. The top scientific research consortium has secured £3.3 million additional funding for further research into avian influenza transmission due to continued risk of spread of disease New research will explore the evolution of the virus and the ability to predict new strains, protecting both animal and human health. As part of a major research consortium announced last June, the UK’s top scientists have discovered that some seabirds are demonstrating immunity to avian influenza. The eight-strong FluMap consortium, headed by the world-leading research team at the Animal Plant Health Agency (APHA), has developed laboratory tools that can dissect the immune response in birds that have been exposed to avian influenza viruses in their lifetime. Preliminary investigations in a small sample size of some species of seabird, including Northern gannets and Shag, revealed specific immunity to H5N1 showing exposure and recovery in a proportion of birds. However, avian influenza viruses are prone to change and so antibody levels will likely decline over time with next year’s offspring not guaranteed to be immune suggesting there are no great population level benefits yet. Scientists hope to look at the effect of antibodies on infection, to better predict the emergence of new viruses with different protein combinations in the future, allowing experts to stay one step ahead to safeguard animal and human health, given 60% of new human diseases originate in animals. High pathogenicity avian influenza (bird flu) is a significant burden on animal health globally and threatens human health, with over 350 infected UK premises detected between 2020 and 2023. Wild bird populations have also suffered significant mortalities across multiple species and wild mammals that have scavenged dead bird carcasses have also been infected. The consortium has also identified several genetic characteristics that explain the ability of the current H5N1 viruses to spread fast and infect a greater range of species. Research has found that multiple virus genes have switched and evolved to act together to enhance fitness to infect, transmit and persist in birds, but remain un-adapted to humans. The consortium has mapped the spread of infection over time and made important discoveries regarding airborne transmission of the virus – determining that infectious virus can only travel short distances (less than 10 metres) and is very unlikely between farms through the air. To further our understanding of this terrible disease, including to study immunity in a range of wild birds, an additional £3.3 million from UK Research and Innovation’s (UKRI) Tackling Infections programme and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) has been granted. A further £3.2 million has also been allocated for a sister consortium, focussing on the potential for human transmission. Partners from both consortia will work closely together in a One Health approach. A joined-up ‘One Health’ approach aims to sustainably balance and optimise the health of people, animals and the environment, recognising that these things are interdependent. This research will allow for better understanding of the potential impacts of animal-human-environment avian influenza interactions. Cross government community collaboration is key in effectively responding to and preparing for evolving threats like avian influenza. Professor Ian Brown, APHA’s Director of Scientific Services and project manager, said: “APHA has led this consortium of the greatest minds from eight world-leading British institutions to address gaps in our understanding of avian influenza and I am excited that we have already made some important discoveries, particularly around the genetic makeup of avian influenza viruses. “I am pleased that with further funding this work can continue - helping us to control the spread of the disease while furthering UK animal health science and ensuring we maintain our world-leading reputation in the field.” UK’s Chief Veterinary Officer Christine Middlemiss said: “I am delighted this research project has received further funding. Bringing together all our national experts increases the speed and quality of our understanding of avian influenza and how it behaves in the UK. “This critical research will aid our development of further strategies to protect our birds and minimise the impact of this dreadful disease.” Biosecurity Minister Lord Benyon said: “Bird flu has been devastating on kept and wild birds. This has caused an emotional and financial toll on bird keepers and those who love our wildlife. “That is why we are continuing to invest in world leading science to improve our understanding of this disease and inform future ways to prevent and control it.” Professor Guy Poppy, interim Executive Chair at the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) and UKRI’s Tackling Infections programme lead, said: “In the face of a relentless challenge, the UK research community in collaboration with government has demonstrated its agility in responding to emerging threats and diseases. “The latest funding for the avian influenza research consortium signifies our collective commitment across research disciplines and government departments to coordinate a world-class response that helps safeguard animal and human health. “This investment is testament to the UK’s determination to stay ahead of avian influenza and underscores the importance of collaboration in the face of evolving threats.” The new funding will respond to the evolving nature of avian influenza and further our understanding of: transmission and infection in different bird populations, including how the virus transmits from wild birds to farmed poultry the gaps in biosecurity that allow the virus to penetrate premises, and how this could be addressed the role of immunity in wild birds in the evolution of the virus how the implementation of vaccination might impact outbreaks UK researchers are already world leaders in studying avian influenza, with the APHA hosting an International Reference Laboratory which conducts analysis on global samples, provides expert advice and rapidly shares the latest information internationally on outbreaks. The knowledge gathered will also be shared with international partners to aid their efforts to tackle the disease with benefits for global risk mitigation. Further information: The research will be published at 9am tomorrow morning and will be available here: https://science.vla.gov.uk/fluglobalnet/publications/flumap-update-oct23.html With seabirds that have expressed presence of antibodies it remains unclear as to what other long-term effects these birds may experience in terms of reduced life expectancy or lower fertility. We are doing all we can to tackle the spread in wild birds, with year-round surveillance, research consortia – to develop new strategies to tackle avian influenza outbreaks, and working closely and meeting regularly with conservation charities, including the WWT, National Trust and RSPB, to consider any further action we can take. Defra and the Welsh Government commissioned JNCC to establish an Avian Influenza Wild Bird Recovery Advisory Group. The group collaborates with the NatureScot Avian Influenza Task Force for Scotland and is gathering information from conservation, land management and wildlife disease experts from a range of organisations to assess what further conservation and monitoring actions can be implemented with respect to wild birds. Natural England is working closely with RSPB on a project to collect and analyse data from seabird colonies in England to help inform our understanding of the factors affecting transmission of HPAI in breeding seabirds and effectively manage impacted sites. In addition, funding has been provided to install mitigation measures at priority sites including the establishment of additional breeding sites for terns (new islands or tern rafts), equipment to assist with monitoring and to ensure sites are prepared to deal with mass mortalities. Consortium members include: APHA, The Pirbright Institute, the Royal Veterinary College, the Roslin Institute, the University of Cambridge, Imperial College London, the University of Leeds, and the University of Nottingham. Their researchers bring together expertise across many areas including microbiologists, epidemiologists, virologists, genomics specialists, mathematical modelers, and those translating science evidence into formats that can be used by policymakers. The £3.3 million is allocated over 17 months. . Tackling Infections is one of UKRI’s five strategic themes. This project is one of a number of investments currently underway to investigate and better manage future infectious disease threats.

Since the disease’s resurgence in the 2020-2021 season, at least 250 million poultry have been culled around the world to nip outbreaks in the bud, according to data from epidemiologist Vijay Dhanasekaran of the University of Hong Kong. The figures are unprecedented: during this period, over 100,000 wild birds of 400 different species have died, with the disease making worrisome jumps to mammals, such as the one observed at an American mink fur farm in Galicia, Spain, and the massive deaths of sea lions on the beaches of Peru. The new avian influenza virus subtype is everywhere. Dhanasekaran’s team has investigated the pathogen’s evolution. On Wednesday, he warned that “the epicenter” of the crisis has shifted from Asia to Europe and Africa. Experts are bracing for the imminent onset of the typical November outbreaks caused by the arrival of migratory birds from the Arctic.The current virus’s lineage was detected in geese in China’s Canton province in 1996. Avian influenza viruses have two characteristic proteins on their surface: hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). There are 18 types of H and 11 types of N, with a multitude of possible combinations. The Guangdong Goose virus was an H5N1 that could be transmitted rapidly among poultry, causing a hemorrhagic disease with a very high mortality rate of over 40%.Two different subtypes of influenza can coincide in the same cell of an animal, giving rise to a phenomenon called genetic reassortment, which generates a third subtype, a mixture of the previous ones. Dhanasekaran’s group has detected key episodes in the virus’s evolution. In 2016, a particularly virulent strain of H5N8 originated in ducks in China. In 2020, a subtype of H5N8 classified as 2.3.4.4b emerged in African poultry. In 2021, the H5N1 2.3.4.4b subtype emerged through genetic reassortment in wild birds in Europe; since November of that year, it has caused “unprecedented outbreaks” in wild animals on five continents, according to Dhanasekaran’s study in the journal Nature.“The shift of the epicenter of these highly pathogenic viruses to new regions has increased the chances of them infecting a wider range of animals, including mammals,” epidemiologist Dhanasekaran warns. The avian flu virus has already been detected in seals, foxes, raccoons, cougars, lynxes and bears, among other species. Exceptionally, humans have also been infected, as in the case of a 9-year-old girl who nearly died after living with sick chickens in a village in Ecuador in late 2022. “Repeated infections in mammals, and in humans, increase the chances of the virus adapting, increasing the likelihood of a pandemic,” Dhanasekaran warns.The team analyzed the genomes of 10,000 viruses and investigated outbreaks recorded by the World Organization for Animal Health and the United Nations since 2005. The authors note that the virus’s ubiquity in wild birds has accelerated the speed of the pathogen’s spread and multiplied the risk of genetic reassortment. “There is a perpetual threat of the virus jumping to humans. This is mainly due to the virus’s ability to evolve rapidly. It can acquire mutations that help it better attach to receptors on human cells, or it can acquire the ability to transmit via aerosols,” Dhanasekaran explains. “The biggest concern is the genetic reassortment of an H5 [bird] virus with human influenza viruses, which is what happened in previous pandemics, such as the ones in 1957 and 1968.”Ornithologist Victor Gamarra notes that the current panzootic — the animal equivalent of a pandemic — has affected “hundreds of thousands of wild birds” around the world. The first case of H5N1 in Peru was detected in a pelican on November 13, 2022. The outbreak spread quickly along the coast and by mid-March at least 100,000 wild birds — belonging to 24 species, some of which are endangered — had been found dead, as Gamarra’s team described in a recent study. The pathogen killed 20% of the pelicans in Peru’s protected marine areas. The ornithologist emphasizes that the total numbers are much higher, because his estimates do not include what happened outside protected areas, where half a million birds could have died.“The virus has spread throughout South America. And it’s no longer just birds, but thousands and thousands of dead sea lions from the Pacific coast to the Atlantic,” laments Gamarra, a researcher at the Natural History Museum of the National University of San Agustín in Arequipa, Peru. “The situation could become even worse when the new bird migration begins soon. A recombination of the virus could occur, and we could possibly be talking about a second wave in South America,” he warns. “This virus spreads fairly quickly, so studies like Dhanasekaran’s may become outdated. That’s this virus’s major threat: we are not prepared to be able to counteract how fast it [spreads].”Sign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage from EL PAÍS USA EditionTu suscripción se está usando en otro dispositivo¿Quieres añadir otro usuario a tu suscripción?Añadir usuarioContinuar leyendo aquíSi continúas leyendo en este dispositivo, no se podrá leer en el otro.¿Por qué estás viendo esto?Flecha Tu suscripción se está usando en otro dispositivo y solo puedes acceder a EL PAÍS desde un dispositivo a la vez.

Study: High Influenza Incidence and Disease Severity Among Children and Adolescents Aged <18 Years ― United States, 2022–23 Season. Image Credit: CDC Influenza activity in the 2022-23 season began in October in the US, earlier than in previous seasons, reaching levels recorded before the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Moreover, the season recorded high hospitalization rates in pediatric populations in the Southeast and a limited decrease in oseltamivir availability, the antiviral influenza drug. Besides, influenza virus co-circulated with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) annually assesses seasonal severity and estimates the rates and numbers of medical visits, hospitalizations, and deaths due to influenza in the US. Seasonal severity is classified using three indicators ­– the percentage of outpatient visits for influenza-like illness (ILI) and influenza-related hospitalization rates and the percentage of deaths. Severity is low if ≥ 2 indicators peak below the fiftieth percentile intensity threshold (IT50), determined using data from previous seasons. It is rated as very high, high, or moderate if ≥ 2 indicators peak above IT98, IT90, or IT50, respectively. About the study In the present study, researchers described the incidence and severity of the 2022-23 influenza season among US adolescents and children. The incidence of influenza-associated outpatient visits, hospitalizations, and deaths was estimated. The hospitalization rates were calculated by applying hospitalization rates from the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET) to the US population, adjusting for possible under-detection. The researchers estimated influenza-related outpatient visits and deaths. The rates were calculated for children under five and those aged 5-17. Influenza vaccination status and clinical characteristics were obtained. Data were collected for hospitalized adolescents and children from 2016-17 to 2021-22 and for an age-stratified sample in 2022-23. The present study reported findings from the 2022-23 season relative to data from 2016-17 to 2021-22 seasons. Findings The 2022-23 influenza season for adolescents and children was highly severe. The three severity indicators peaked between IT90 and IT98. The hospitalization rate and percentage of outpatient ILI visits peaked in November 2022, three weeks before influenza-associated deaths peaked, which was high for four weeks in December 2022.

Further, medical visit and hospitalization rates among adolescents and children aged 5-17 were higher in 2022-23 than in previous seasons. Children under five had the second-highest rates of medical visits and hospitalization in 2022-23. However, the rates of influenza-related deaths were low, consistent with prior seasons. FluSurv-NET reported 2,762 influenza-related hospitalizations in individuals under 18 between October 2022 and April 2023. Nearly half had underlying conditions like obesity, asthma, and neurologic disorders. More than 95% of infections were due to influenza A virus. Most hospitalizations occurred in October–November 2022, higher than in previous seasons. About 18.3% of hospitalized subjects were vaccinated in 2022-23, compared to 35.8% to 41.8% in previous seasons. The proportion of hospitalized subjects receiving antiviral therapy was similar in 2021-22 and 2022-23 but lower during pre-COVID-19 seasons. Further, the proportions of patients requiring intensive care and mechanical ventilation and in-hospital deaths in 2022-23 were similar to previous seasons. Conclusions The influenza season in 2022-23 was rated as highly severe among adolescents and children, the fourth such instance since the influenza A pandemic of 2009. The severity indicators surpassed the high severity thresholds, with peaks occurring early in the season. The rates of outpatient visits and hospitalizations due to influenza were higher than during prior seasons, which strained healthcare systems. Moreover, fewer hospitalized adolescents and children in 2022-23 were vaccinated than in previous seasons. Similarly, the proportion of pediatric hospitalized patients receiving antiviral medication was low. Overall, the findings highlight the importance of seasonal influenza vaccination for adolescents and children, emphasizing the need to increase coverage of antiviral treatment for hospitalized patients.

Here, we identify that obese individuals have deficient pulmonary antiviral immune responses in bronchoalveolar lavage cells but not in bronchial epithelial cells or peripheral blood dendritic cells. We show that the obese human airway metabolome is perturbed with associated increases in the airway concentrations of the adipokine leptin which correlated negatively with the magnitude of ex vivo antiviral responses. Exogenous pulmonary leptin administration in mice directly impaired antiviral type I interferon responses in vivo and ex vivo in cultured airway macrophages. Obese individuals hospitalised with influenza showed dysregulated upper airway immune responses. These studies provide insight into mechanisms driving propensity to severe influenza infections in obesity and raise the potential for development of leptin manipulation or interferon administration as novel strategies for conferring protection from severe infections in obese higher risk individuals.

An increased susceptibility of obese individuals to severe respiratory viral infections was initially highlighted during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic where this comorbidity was consistently observed to be independently associated with adverse outcomes including requirement for hospitalisation and death2,3,4. Similar risks have been demonstrated in studies of seasonal influenza strains5. More recently, obesity has also emerged as a major risk factor for adverse outcome from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)6.Obesity may increase the risk of adverse outcomes from respiratory viral infections via a number of putative mechanisms including the influence of comorbid conditions (e.g. cardiovascular disease), direct consequences of altered lung mechanics (e.g. lung volume restriction)7 or by having immunometabolic effects upon the pulmonary host response. Innate antiviral immune responses including the production of type I and III interferons (IFN) and subsequent induction of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) are a major mechanism of pulmonary mucosal protection against viruses such as influenza. Support for defective innate immunity as a mechanistic driver of obesity-related adverse consequences comes from animal studies where obese mice show attenuated induction of type I IFN pathways associated with impaired virus clearance8,9,10. However, this has not been observed consistently across all influenza strains10,11. Whether a similar impairment in innate immune responses occurs in obese humans to drive adverse clinical outcomes from influenza is poorly understood. Moreover, the key type I and III IFN-producing cell types (e.g. macrophages, epithelial cells or dendritic cells) that may be affected and mechanisms that drive any potential defect are unknown.Here, we utilise multi-compartment peripheral blood and airway sampling within a study of morbidly obese individuals undergoing bariatric surgery. This study design gave unique access to stable-state lower respiratory tract samples and allowed detailed investigation into inherent alterations of innate antiviral immunity in obese individuals relative to non-obese control subjects. We identify that obese individuals display deficient ex vivo type I and III IFN responses to influenza, a defect that occurs in airway macrophages but not other principal IFN-producing cell types (epithelial cells or dendritic cells). We elucidate that the airway metabolomic milieu is perturbed in obesity and that concentrations of prototypical adipokines, including leptin, are altered. Using functional experiments in mouse models of viral infection, we demonstrate that increased leptin is causally related to impairment of antiviral immunity in macrophages. Finally, we demonstrate that airway immune responses are dysregulated in obese individuals hospitalised with naturally acquired influenza infections. Taken together, these data implicate deficient airway innate immunity involving macrophages in the increased propensity to severe viral infections observed in obese individuals.ResultsStudy subjectsThe patient enrolment process for recruitment of subjects in this study is summarised in Fig. 1. There were 15 obese subjects and 15 non-obese control subjects included. There were no significant differences between the groups other than on anthropomorphic measures, as intended (Table 1). Of note, 2 of the 15 obese subjects had type 2 diabetes mellitus, both of which were treated with metformin only (not insulin dependent).Fig. 1: Schematic diagram showing recruitment into the study.Subjects were recruited as part of a case control study. Total subject numbers screened in each group and subjects excluded are shown.Full size imageTable 1 Demographic and anthropometric characteristics in obese and non-obese subjects included in ex vivo experiments. Data represented as median (IQR) and analysed by two-tailed Mann–Witney U test or Fisher’s Exact testFull size tableObesity does not alter bronchial epithelial immune responsesRespiratory epithelial cells are the primary target cells for influenza infection12 and impaired epithelial type I and III antiviral IFN responses have been reported in asthma and COPD, conditions similarly associated with susceptibility to severe viral infection13,14,15. We therefore initially hypothesised that obese individuals would display a similar impairment in epithelial antiviral immunity. In some recruited subjects, bronchial epithelial cell (BEC) cultures were unsuccessful; we therefore included 10 obese and 13 non-obese individuals in these experiments (Fig. 2a). Cells were stimulated ex vivo with the clinically relevant influenza viruses: A/Eng/195 (pandemic H1N1/09), A/Eng/691/10 (seasonal H3N2) and B/Florida (influenza B). No significant induction of type I IFN-α protein was observed for any of the three strains of influenza at 24 h (Fig. 2b). Type I IFN-β and -type III IFN-λ1 were significantly induced by H3N2 at 24 h with no induction observed for H1N1 or B/Florida viruses (Fig. 2c, d). The magnitude of induction of IFNs-β and -λ by H3N2 was no different between obese and non-obese individuals (Fig. 2c, d). Combined, these findings indicate that, unlike other disease states predisposed to severe influenza infection, obesity does not impair the epithelial antiviral response.Fig. 2: Obesity does not alter bronchial epithelial cell antiviral or proinflammatory responses to influenza infection.a Bronchial epithelial cells from 10 obese and 13 non-obese control subjects were cultured and infected ex vivo with H1N1/09 (H1N1), seasonal H3N2 and B/Florida (B/Flo) influenza viruses.

At 24 h post-infection pH1N1/09 did not significantly induce IL-6, IL-8 or TNF, whereas H3N2 resulted in significant expression of all three cytokines in obese and non-obese subjects (Fig. 2e–g). B/Florida similarly induced all three cytokines in non-obese and obese subjects (Fig. 2e–g). As observed with the antiviral response, there was no difference in the induction of IL-6, IL-8 or TNF proteins between obese and non-obese individuals (Fig. 2e–g), demonstrating that obesity also does not alter the epithelial pro-inflammatory response to influenza infection.Antiviral immune responses are impaired in bronchoalveolar lavage cells from obese individualsHaving observed that obese individuals did not display dysregulated epithelial immunity to influenza, we next focused on responses in BAL cells, comprising ~95% alveolar macrophages. Macrophages also have a key role in the innate antiviral immune response to infection18 and similarly display deficient IFN responses in other conditions predisposed to severe viral infection such as asthma and COPD19,20. BAL cells obtained from obese and non-obese subjects were therefore infected ex vivo with H1N1/09, H3N2 and B/Florida (Fig. 3a). IFN-α was induced by all three viruses with significantly reduced induction observed in obese compared with non-obese individuals (Fig. 3b). IFN-β and IFN-λ were also induced by all three viruses in non-obese individuals but induction of IFN-β by H1N1 and IFN-λ by all three viruses failed to reach statistical significance and induction was significantly attenuated in obese compared with non-obese subjects (Fig. 3c, d). These data indicated that, in contrast to the epithelial response which is unaffected in obesity, BAL cells from obese individuals have an impaired potential to generate protective type I and III IFN antiviral responses. Despite this impairment of innate antiviral immunity, we did not detect any differences in BAL cell influenza M gene copies between obese and non-obese individuals at 24 or 48 h post-infection (Fig. 3e–g).Fig. 3: Antiviral immune responses are impaired in bronchoalveolar lavage cells from obese subjects.a Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells from 15 obese and 15 non-obese control subjects were cultured and infected ex vivo with H1N1/09 (H1N1), seasonal H3N2 and B/Florida (B/Flo) influenza viruses.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageWe additionally evaluated pro-inflammatory cytokine production in response to influenza infection in BAL cells. Baseline (medium-treated) BAL cells from obese individuals had significantly reduced spontaneous and post-infection production of IL-6, CXCL8/IL-8 and TNF compared to non-obese individuals. (Fig. 3h–j).Obesity does not alter ex vivo antiviral responses in dendritic cellsDendritic cells (DCs) are resident in the peripheral blood and lung and the plasmacytoid DC subset which express TLRs 7, 8 and 9 can be stimulated by influenza virus ssRNA to produce type I IFN21. Moreover plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) are known to be particularly potent producers of type I IFN22 We therefore studied whether obesity affected antiviral immune responses in these cells by isolating pDCs from peripheral blood by magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) (Supplementary Fig. 1a) followed by stimulation ex vivo with the same three influenza virus strains. There was no difference in DC purity between obese and non-obese subjects (Supplementary Fig. 1b). Significant induction of IFN-α, -β and -λ1 by H1N1 and B/Florida was observed in non-obese subjects and of IFN-α and -β by all three influenza strains in obese subjects with no differences in the magnitudes of induction in obese versus non-obese subjects (Supplementary Fig. 1c–e). Therefore, as observed for BECs, obesity does not impair the dendritic cell antiviral immune response.Evaluation of pro-inflammatory cytokine responses in dendritic cells showed that IL-6 was induced by H1N1 and B/Florida in non-obese subjects and by all three viruses in obese subjects with no difference observed between the two subject groups (Supplementary Fig. 1f). For CXCL8/IL-8, induction occurred with H1N1 and B/Florida in obese and H1N1 in non-obese subjects with attenuation of responses for H1N1 observed in obese subjects (Supplementary Fig. 1g). TNF was induced by H1N1 and B/Florida in non-obese subjects and by all three viruses in obese subjects with no differences observed between the two subject groups (Supplementary Fig. 1h).Alterations of the airway metabolomic and adipokine milieu in obesityHaving observed a specific impairment of antiviral immunity within BAL macrophages from obese individuals, we next reasoned that the metabolomic milieu within the obese airways would be altered and may contribute to the observed ex vivo immune dysregulation. We therefore profiled BAL fluid metabolite abundances using Ultrahigh Performance Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) to gain insight into potential mechanisms that may be driving impaired immunity in obesity (Fig. 4a). Unsupervised Principal Components Analysis demonstrated a partial separation of obese and non-obese groupings (Supplementary Fig 2). This was followed by a supervised analysis where Orthogonal Projections to Latent Structures Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA) revealed differences between obese and non-obese individuals (Fig. 4b). Differential abundance analysis performed via visualisation of the volcano plot identified 17 metabolites with significantly altered responses with the majority (n = 15) downregulated and two metabolites (adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and glycerol) upregulated in BAL from obese individuals (Fig. 4c). Heat map of the 50 metabolites with the highest peak area responses detected in BAL revealed a similar pattern, with all but three being elevated in non-obese participants, with only AMP, glycerol and mannitol/sorbitol being elevated in obese participants (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 4). Enrichment analysis indicated a range of different metabolites that were enriched within the cohort, including seleno-amino acid, methionine and fatty acid metabolic pathways in obese compared with non-obese participants (Fig. 4e).Fig. 4: Altered airway metabolomic milieu in obesity.a Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid from 15 obese and 15 non-obese control subjects was collected and processed for metabolomics analysis. b Orthogonal projections to latent structures-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) showing separation of obese (green) and non-obese (red) subjects. c Differential abundance analysis, performed via visualisation of the volcano plot.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageFatty acid metabolism has been shown to influence antiviral responses as dysregulated cholesterol biosynthesis can impact type I IFN signalling23. Obesity is linked to fatty acid metabolism through adipokines such as leptin which can stimulate fatty acid oxidation via AMP-activated protein kinase24. Since AMP was one of the two metabolites significantly upregulated in BAL fluid from obese participants, we therefore further focused on a targeted evaluation of adipokine concentrations. These cell signalling molecules are produced by adipose tissue and can exert pleiotropic effects upon immune function. Leptin, specifically, has been shown to impair macrophage-mediated immune responses to bacterial pathogens25 and we therefore postulated that similar effects could occur in the context of antiviral immunity. We found that leptin concentrations were augmented in obese versus non-obese individuals in both the upper (nasosorption) and lower (bronchosorption and BAL) airways (Fig. 4f). Measurement of other adipokines showed reduced adiponectin concentrations in BAL and nasosorption but not bronchosorption (Supplementary Fig. 3a) and reduced concentrations of visfatin in BAL but not nasosorption or bronchosorption (Supplementary Fig. 3b) in obese compared with non-obese individuals. There were no significant differences in resistin concentrations in any sample type (Supplementary Fig. 3c).Furthermore, bronchosorption concentrations of leptin negatively correlated with the magnitude of BAL cell IFN-β responses to all three influenza strains tested in our ex vivo experiments, with greater concentrations of leptin being significantly associated with weaker induction of IFN-β by each virus strain (Fig. 4g). Bronchosorption concentrations of leptin also significantly positively correlated with BAL AMP levels (Fig. 4h). This indicated a possible causal link between raised leptin concentrations and impaired antiviral immunity in obesity, potentially through perturbed fatty acid metabolism. By contrast, bronchosorption concentrations of adiponectin, visfatin and resistin showed no significant correlations with ex vivo BAL cell IFN-β responses to all three influenza strains tested (Supplementary Fig. 3d–f).Exogenous leptin administration reduces airway type I IFN responses to influenza infection in miceNext, to elucidate if suppression of IFN responses in obesity is functionally related to increased airway leptin concentrations, we used pulmonary recombinant leptin protein administration (at a previously reported dose26) in mice (Fig. 5a) to mimic the increased airway concentrations observed in human subjects and permit study of direct causal effects upon antiviral immunity. Consistent with the known pro-inflammatory effect of leptin27, administration of exogenous leptin alone increased lung mRNA expression of IfnB and the antiviral ISGs 2′-5′Oas, Viperin and Pkr compared to vehicle-treated controls (Fig. 5b). All four of these genes were also induced in lung tissue by influenza X31 (a mouse adapted H3N2 strain) at 6 h post-infection. Leptin administration prior to influenza infection attenuated virus-induced expression of all four of these antiviral immune genes (Fig. 5b), indicating that leptin is functionally related to attenuated pulmonary type I IFN immune responses. This was associated with a later augmentation in pro-inflammatory responses at 72 h post-infection with increased BAL neutrophils, activated neutrophil subsets (CD63+ and CD64+) and pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF observed in mice treated with leptin prior to infection compared to vehicle-treated infected control mice (Fig. 5c–f).Fig. 5: Pulmonary leptin administration reduces airway immune responses to influenza infection in mice.a BALB/c mice were treated with intranasal leptin protein (16μg) or vehicle control, 12 h prior to infection with Influenza X31 or PBS control. b Ifnβ, 2’-5’Oas, Viperin and PKR lung mRNA expression measured by qPCR at 6 h post-infection. c BAL neutrophils and activated neutrophil subsets (CD63+ and CD64+) enumerated by flow cytometry at 72 h post-infection.

Statistical significance analysed using one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-test. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imagePrevious studies have reported that raised suppressor of cytokine signalling (SOCS)-3 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from obese individuals is associated with reduced production of type I IFNs in response to TLR-agonist stimulation28. Accordingly, we found that leptin administration in mice increased lung expression of Socs3 mRNA (Fig. 5g). In conjunction with the concomitant reduced induction of IfnB and ISGs upon viral infection this suggests that high leptin levels in obesity may promote increased expression of SOCS-3, a known negative regulator of JAK-STAT-mediated type I IFN signalling, to attenuate the early antiviral immune response during influenza infection.Leptin treatment impairs ex vivo type I IFN responses in mouse macrophagesWe next determined whether the suppressive effect of leptin upon pulmonary antiviral immunity was mediated through effects on airway macrophages, given our prior data of a specific defect in this cell type from obese human subjects (Fig. 3). We therefore isolated BAL macrophages from mice and infected them ex vivo with influenza, in the presence or absence of exogenous leptin treatment at 320 µg/ml (mimicking the dose used in vivo) and ten-fold lower 32 µg/ml concentrations (Fig. 5h). Influenza infection induced IfnB and the ISGs 2′-5′ Oas and Pkr in macrophages (Fig. 5i). Leptin treatment (320 µg/ml) significantly impaired virus-induction of IfnB and Pkr with a trend towards reduced 2’-5’ Oas (Fig. 5i). As observed in vivo with whole lung expression, leptin treatment also increased Socs3 mRNA specifically in macrophages (Fig. 5j). These data corroborated our human ex vivo findings and confirmed a specific defect of macrophage immunity associated with augmented airway leptin.Dysregulated airway immune responses in obese individuals hospitalised with influenzaTo confirm the clinical relevance of our ex vivo human and ex vivo and in vivo animal findings, we studied upper airway immune responses in the Mechanisms of Severe Acute Influenza Consortium (MOSAIC) study which recruited adult patients hospitalised with clinical influenza presenting to hospitals in London and Liverpool (UK) during the winters of 2009/10 and 2010/11 (periods of intense influenza activity in the UK). The MOSAIC study was associated with the larger multicentre FLU-CIN (Influenza Clinical Information Network) cohort study in which obesity has already been clearly shown to be independently associated with adverse outcomes29 Of 133 patients recruited to the study, n = 27 (20.3%) were classified as obese (BMI > 30; Fig. 6a). Baseline demographic and clinical data of obese and non-obese individuals are shown in Table 2.Fig. 6: Altered upper airway immune responses in obese adult patients hospitalised with influenza infection.a Schematic of the Mechanisms of Severe Acute Influenza Consortium (MOSAIC) study highlighting timepoints from hospitalisation of study samples. b Nasopharyngeal virus load between obese and non-obese patients. c Nasopharyngeal aspirate and (d) serum multiplex immune mediators comparing obese and non-obese patients.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageTable 2 Demographic and clinic characteristics in obese and non-obese subjects within the MOSAIC studyFull size tableThere were no differences in nasopharyngeal virus loads between obese and non-obese patients during the acute (24 and 48 h after hospitalisation) or recovery (>4 weeks) phases of influenza infection (Fig. 6b). There was also no difference in nasopharyngeal IFN-α or IFN-γ concentrations between the two groups but obese patients had increased concentrations of IFN-β at 24 and 48 h after presentation, compared to non-obese patients (Fig. 6c). Pro-inflammatory cytokine concentrations were also increased in nasopharyngeal aspirates from obese patients including IL-1, IL-6, CXCL8/IL-8 at 24 and 48 h, CXCL10/IP-10 at 24 h and TNF at 48 h after presentation, all compared to non-obese patients (Fig. 6c). By contrast, there were no significant differences in serum concentrations of any of these cytokines between obese and non-obese patients (Fig. 6d). Collectively, these findings indicate that, during acute hospitalised influenza infection, immune dysregulation occurs locally within the upper airway mucosa but not centrally within the systemic circulation.DiscussionThe mechanisms that underlie susceptibility to severe respiratory viral infections in individuals with comorbidities such as obesity remains a major area of interest in the field. In this study we combined human and animal studies to demonstrate that obesity is associated with a specific impairment of antiviral type I and III IFN responses to influenza infection within bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) macrophages. Our experiments indicate a mechanism for impairment of antiviral immunity in the obese lung occurring through increased airway leptin concentrations which we observed were increased in the airways of obese people and which directly inhibited protective pulmonary antiviral immune responses when administered to mice.In recent years, there has been intense focus on susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection with type I and III interferon immunopathology being a major pathway of interest30. However, influenza remains a significant cause of morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs worldwide with numbers of positive cases rising exponentially recently due to increased social interactions following easing of COVID-19 lockdown measures. Therefore, better understanding of mechanisms driving susceptibility to influenza in at-risk individuals remains a major global research priority. Obesity has previously been identified to be a strong risk factor for severe influenza infections during previous pandemic and seasonal outbreaks2,3,4,5 but the reasons underlying this heightened susceptibility have been unclear. Although vaccination is recommended for high-risk individuals, including those with BMI > 40, these approaches do not confer complete protection and new approaches using antiviral or immunomodulatory therapies are urgently needed.Production of type I (-α and -β) and type III (-λ) IFNs are a major host protective mechanism to counteract respiratory virus infections and, in their absence, mice succumb to influenza infection31. Both diet- and genetically-induced obese mice (leptin- or leptin receptor-deficient) suffer greater lung damage and higher mortality from influenza than non-obese controls31. Detailed study of these mouse models has repeatedly found attenuated type I IFN production in obese mice infected with influenza9,10,32,33,34,35,36,37. Despite this evidence from animal studies, there are very few studies that directly investigate obesity-related antiviral responses in human subjects. Limited case series report greater viral replication with prolonged shedding in obese subjects38,39. Studies also indicate that PBMCs from obese individuals show impaired type I IFN responses to TLR3 agonist stimulation40,41. However, examination of peripheral cell responses is an imprecise surrogate for responses within the lower respiratory tract (the primary site of influenza pathology). Obtaining lower airway samples from stable-state morbidly obese individuals to investigate pulmonary-specific immune responses is technically challenging since bronchoscopy under conscious sedation may be considered risky in these individuals. Our study therefore utilised a unique design whereby lower airway samples were taken directly from obese subjects during general anaesthesia being administered as part of a bariatric surgery procedure. This opportunistic approach allowed us to interrogate the ex vivo antiviral immune response within the two major lung resident IFN-producing cell populations, epithelial cells and macrophages. We identified that type I and III IFN responses are specifically impaired in BAL cells (comprised predominantly (~95%) of macrophages) from obese individuals but unaffected in bronchial epithelial cells (major producers of IFN-β and IFN-λ) or plasmacytoid dendritic cells (major producers of IFN-α). We and others have reported similar defects in BAL cells from other high-risk individuals including those with asthma and COPD20,42 and recent single-cell transcriptomic data from intubated COVID-19 patients indicates attenuated type I IFN in obese versus non-obese subjects43. Alveolar macrophages are well known to play a key role in mediating immune responses to influenza and their ablation in mouse models worsens influenza-mediated pathology and mortality44. It has also been reported that alveolar macrophages are an important source of type I IFNs during influenza infection, as ex vivo IFN-α and -β induction was reduced in alveolar macrophages but not pDCs sorted from the lungs of diet-induced obese mice9. Our data supports the central role played by these cells in innate immunity and highlight that their antiviral responses to influenza infection are attenuated in obese individuals.Macrophage immune function can be reprogrammed through metabolomic alterations and we therefore hypothesised that the obese pulmonary microenvironment may be impacting upon type I IFN pathways to dampen innate antiviral immunity. Analysis of the airway metabolome in our subjects revealed profound alterations associated with obesity including dysregulation of fatty acid metabolism, a pathway that has been mechanistically linked to antiviral immunity23,45. AMP was one of two metabolites significantly upregulated in BAL from obese subjects and the adipokine leptin, through activation of AMP-activated kinase, is known to directly stimulate fatty-acid oxidation24. Accordingly, we identified increased concentrations of leptin in the obese airway which positively correlated with AMP concentrations and negatively correlated with the magnitude of ex vivo BAL cell type I IFN response, suggesting that leptin may directly impact upon antiviral pathways through perturbation of fatty acid metabolism. To investigate a functional relationship, we studied the effect of pulmonary recombinant leptin protein administration in mice to mimic the increased concentrations observed in the obese human airway and our results indicate a direct causal role for leptin in attenuating antiviral immune responses. Leptin is a non-glycosylated hormone of 146 amino acids that is synthesised by adipose cells in response to food intake and plays a central role in appetite and body weight homeostasis. It is increasingly recognised to have a regulatory role in metabolism-immune system interplay and exerts its effects upon immune cells through the cell surface leptin receptor (LepR)46. Leptin can increase oxidative stress in macrophages and in a diet-induced obesity influenza mouse model, hyperleptinaemia was associated with increased viral spread, inflammation and mortality, consequences that could be reversed by anti-leptin antibody administration47 Surprisingly a greater number of metabolites were upregulated in BAL from non-obese subjects. The reasons for this observation are unclear and further independent validation in larger studies is needed to corroborate our findings.Mechanistically, we identified that airway leptin augmentation induces expression of SOCS3 in macrophages, a known negative regulator of type I IFN pathways via inhibition of JAK/STAT signalling. Our data are supported by previous studies linking elevated leptin with induction of systemic SOCS3 expression in obese individuals, as a mechanism of negative feedback46,48. Genetic silencing of SOCS3 but not SOCS1 in PBMCs from obese individuals can boost type I IFN immunity and exogenous leptin administration also induces SOCS3 and inhibits type I IFN responses to TLR3 agonist stimulation in PBMCs28. cAMP has also been shown to upregulate SOCS3 in endothelial cells49. Our data therefore implicate the leptin-AMP-SOC3 axis as an important determinant of antiviral immunity in the airway that may drive susceptibility to severe influenza infections in morbidly obese individuals. Whether this pathway is similarly dysregulated in overweight or non-morbidly obese individuals remains unknown. Given the strong correlation between BMI and serum leptin concentrations reported in multiple studies, we would anticipate that airway leptin concentrations would be similarly correlated with BMI and therefore we postulate that a continuum (i.e. the same effect would be present but to a lesser degree) would be observed in terms of antiviral immune suppression. Further studies are needed to determine this.Finally, to study the clinical relevance of our findings, we carried out immune analyses within samples from a ‘real-world’ cohort of adults hospitalised with influenza. Upper airway in vivo IFN responses were not deficient in hospitalised obese patients, which corroborated the results of our in vitro epithelial cell influenza infection experiments. Furthermore, the lack of differences in serum cytokine levels between obese and non-obese patients hospitalised with influenza were in keeping with results from ex vivo simulation of circulating pDCs. The MOSAIC study did not routinely have access to BAL data and therefore our results which utilised ex vivo stimulation of BAL cells demonstrating a type I and III IFN deficiency in obese individuals helps to provide a mechanistic understanding of why obese subjects are more susceptible to viral infections. We observed increased upper respiratory proinflammatory responses associated with obesity in this cohort, an effect that was also mimicked at late timepoints in our mouse model of leptin administration with influenza infection. There is likely to be a delay between virus infection and hospital presentation which typically occurs at the peak of symptom severity (around day 5–6 after viral inoculation in human influenza challenge models50). Therefore, the initial impairment of antiviral responses observed in macrophages ex vivo could drive an early presymptomatic increase in viral replication which may subsequently (by day 5–6) drive later accentuation of antiviral and pro-inflammatory airway responses. We have observed a similar pattern of antiviral immune expression in asthma where type I IFN deficiency is observed in BECs and BAL macrophages ex vivo13,19,42 but in vivo type I IFN and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression is increased at day 4 after experimental RV challenge51. It should also be noted that COVID-19 studies have demonstrated disparate interferon expression in the upper and lower respiratory tract during acute disease52.In conclusion, our study uncovers insight into mechanisms driving susceptibility to severe influenza infections in obese individuals. Future work should focus on whether sustained weight loss leads to a restitution of this impaired antiviral immunity, especially given that epidemiological evidence indicates that the clinical risk of influenza infection diminishes following bariatric surgery53 and impaired mononuclear cell type II IFN responses in obese individuals can be corrected by weight loss54. As a preventable condition, treatment of obesity itself must remain a priority and is potentially the most effective method of reducing risk of severe viral infections. However, this is not achievable for many individuals and the findings of our study open up the potential for leptin manipulation or IFN administration as novel strategies for conferring protection from severe infections.MethodsEthics statementHuman bronchoscopy study: the study received ethical approval from the Surrey Borders Research Ethics Committee (approval number 12/LO/1812). Informed consent was obtained from all participants.The Mechanisms of Severe Acute Influenza Consortium (MOSAIC) study of hospitalised influenza infections: the study was approved by the NHS National Research Ethics Service, Outer West London REC (09/H0709/52, 09/MRE00/67). Informed consent was obtained from all participants.Animal experiments: all animal work was performed under the authority of the UK Home Office outlined in the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 after ethical review by Imperial College London Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Body (project licence PP4051423).Study design and participantsMorbidly obese individuals (body mass index (BMI) ≥ 35 kg/m2) were prospectively recruited from the bariatric surgery service at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust as part of a case-control study. Healthy non-obese control subjects (BMI 20–25 kg/m2) were matched for age, gender and ethnicity. Exclusion criteria included age over 60, atopy defined as skin prick test positivity to one or more of nine common aeroallergens, obstructive airways disease (asthma or COPD), history of smoking within the last 6 months or smoking history > 20 pack years, inhaled medication, statin or thiazolidinedione treatment (any of which could confound interferon (IFN) responses), respiratory tract infection within the preceding 3 months and pregnancy.Sample processing and cell cultureAll subjects underwent anthropometric characterisation and clinical sampling including blood, nasal synthetic absorptive matrix (SAM) sampling (nasosorption, to sample airway lining fluid), and bronchoscopy with bronchosorption, bronchial brushings, and BAL, as previously described55,56.BAL macrophages: BAL fluid was filtered, centrifuged at 200 RCF for 10 min. The supernatant was removed and stored at −80oC for metabolomic/adipokine measurement. The remaining cell pellet (comprising>95% macrophages) was resuspended in medium. Cells were then washed ain PBS, resuspended at a final concentration of 2 × 106 cells/mL and then plated in a 96-well plate at 2 × 105 cells per well.Bronchial epithelial cells: brushed epithelial cells were dislodged into bronchial epithelial cell growth medium (BEGM, Lonza). Cells were placed into a T25 culture flask and incubated at 37oC with 5% CO2 until 95% confluency. Cells were passaged twice before being seeded onto 24 well plates at 5 × 105 cells per well.Plasmacytoid dendritic cells: plasmacytoid and conventional dendritic cells (pDCs and cDCs respectively) were isolated from PBMCs using a commercial human DC isolation kit according to manufacturer’s instructions (Miltenyi Biotec, Germany). The purity of the positively selected cell fraction containing the enriched DCs was confirmed by flow cytometry. Cells were plated in 96 well plates at 20,000 cells per well.Ex vivo virus infection experimentsBAL macrophages, BECs or DCs were infected with influenza viruses, A/Eng/195, A/Eng/691/10 or B/Florida, at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 3 or medium control. After one hour the viral inoculum was removed and fresh medium was added. Cell supernatants and lysates were subsequently harvested at 24 and 48 h. Supernatants and lysates were stored at −80 °C until protein quantification or RNA extraction respectively.Influenza infection and treatment of miceIn vivo protocols: Female mice (6–8 weeks of age) on a BALB/c background purchased from Charles River UK Laboratories were used for all animal studies. Mice were housed in individually ventilated cages under specific pathogen-free conditions.Mice were treated intranasally under isofluorane anaesthesia with 16 ng of recombinant mouse leptin (Sigma Aldrich) in 50 µl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or vehicle (PBS) control, as previously described26. Twelve hours after leptin treatment, mice were intranasally infected with influenza virus strain X31 (1 × 105 pfu in 50 µl of PBS) or PBS control. Mice were euthanized with intraperitoneal overdose administration of pentobarbitone solution.In vitro mouse alveolar macrophage experimentsNaive mice underwent BAL with PBS supplemented with 2.5 mM EDTA. BAL cells were resuspended in 10% RPMI medium, seeded at a density of 5 × 104 cells per well and then incubated at 37 oC with 5% CO2 for 2 h to allow adherence of macrophages. Cells were treated with leptin at 32 µg/ml and 320 µg/ml concentrations or medium control for 12 h before infection with influenxa X31 (MOI 1.0). Cell lysates were harvested at 6 h post-infection for downstream mRNA expression analysis.The Mechanisms of Severe Acute Influenza Consortium study of hospitalised influenza infectionsReal-world data from obese and non-obese individuals with PCR-confirmed influenza were drawn from the multi-site, prospective, observational Mechanisms of Severe Acute Influenza Consortium (MOSAIC) study57,58. Detailed clinical and demographic data were recorded for all participants. BMI was calculated where height and weight data were available, defining obesity as BMI ≥ 30. Patients were also classified as obese if BMI could not be calculated but ‘obese’ was documented in the case report forms used to collect demographic data. Nasopharyngeal aspirates and swabs were taken within 72 h of admission and used to confirm influenza infection by PCR. Out of a total of 133 patients, 120 were influenza A positive (116 H1N1, 3 H3N2 and 1 undetermined), 12 were influenza B positive and 1 had influenza A + B coinfection. Nasopharyngeal aspirates and blood samples were taken within 24 h of admission (as previously described57,58). Time 1 (T1) samples were collected within 24 h of admission, T2 samples within 48 h of admission and T3 samples in convalescence ≥4 weeks after presentation.Protein assaysIFN-α2a, IFN-β, IFN-λ1, IL-6, IL-8, and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) proteins were quantified in cell supernatants from ex vivo experiments using Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) assays (Mesoscale Discovery, USA). Adipokines were quantified in nasal lining fluid (nasosorption), bronchial lining fluid (bronchosorption) and BAL samples by Luminex immunoassays (Luminex, USA). Cytokine protein concentrations in mouse BAL were assayed using commercial ‘duoset’ enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits (Biotechne, UK). MSD assays were used to measure all immune proteins in nasal and serum samples from the MOSAIC study cohort.RNA and quantitative PCR for measurement of immune gene expressionTotal RNA was extracted from the right upper lobe of mouse lung and placed in RNA later, prior to RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis using the Omniscript RT kit (Qiagen, UK). Quantitative PCR was carried out using previously described specific primers and probes for each gene of interest59 and normalised to 18 S rRNA housekeeping gene. 2-ΔΔCt (fold-change) was used to calculate gene expression relative to the control group. Primer/Probe sequences for mouse genes were as follows.Ifnb Forward: CCATCATGAACAGGTGGAT; Ifnb Reverse: GAGAGGGCTGTGGTGGAGAA, Ifnb Probe: CTCCACGCTGCGTTCCTGCTGTG.2’-5’ Oas Forward: TCCTGGGTCATGTTAATACTTCCA, 2’-5’ Oas Reverse: CCCCAGGGAGGTACATTCCT, 2’-5’ Oas Probe:CAAGCCTGATCCCAGAATCTATGCCATC;Viperin Forward.

Cells were then washed in PBS containing 0.1% sodium azide and 1% BSA followed by staining for surface markers at 40C for 30 minutes. Details of antibodies used are shown in Supplementary Table 1. Cells were subsequently washed in PBS containing 0.1% sodium azide and 1% BSA before fixation in 2% paraformaldehyde. Neutrophils were identified using the following surface markers, as previously described60: The gating strategy adopted is shown in Supplementary Fig. 5.MetabolomicsBAL samples were analysed by Ultrahigh Performance Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) performed by Metabolon (Morrisville, NC, USA), as described previously. Briefly, a Waters ACQUITY UPLC system was coupled to a Thermo Scientific Q-Exactive MS interfaced with a heated electrospray ionization (HESI-II) source and Orbitrap mass analyser operated at 35,000 FWHM mass resolution. Samples were prepared using the automated MicroLab STAR® system (Hamilton, Bonaduz, Switzerland). Several recovery standards were added prior to the first step in the extraction process for QC purposes (see method descriptions below for more detail). To remove protein, dissociate small molecules bound to protein or trapped in the precipitated protein matrix, and to recover chemically diverse metabolites, proteins were precipitated with methanol under vigorous shaking for 2 min (GenoGrinder 2000, Glen Mills, Clifton, NJ, USA) followed by centrifugation. The resulting extract was divided into five fractions: two for analysis by two separate reverse phase (RP)/UPLC-MS/MS methods with positive ion mode electrospray ionisation (ESI), one for analysis by RP/UPLC-MS/MS with negative ion mode ESI, one for analysis by HILIC/UPLC-MS/MS with negative ion mode ESI, and one sample was reserved for backup. Samples were placed briefly on a TurboVap® (Zymark, Clackamas, OR, USA) to remove the organic solvent. The sample extracts were stored overnight under nitrogen before reconstitution in compatible solvents suitable for each analytical protocol. One aliquot was analysed in positive ion mode on a C18 column (Waters UPLC BEH C18-2.1 × 100 mm, 1.7 µm) using water (Buffer A) and methanol (Buffer B), containing 0.05% perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPA) and 0.1% formic acid (FA). A flow rate of 0.35 mL/min was employed with a linear gradient protocol running from 5% B to 80% over 3.35 min. Seven instrument performance standards (d7-glucose, d5-glutamine, d2-threonine, d5-hippuric acid, d3-methionine, d3-leucine, and Br-phenylalanine) and two process assessment standards (fluorophenylglycine and chlorophenylalanine) were used. A second aliquot was analysed in positive ion mode on the C18 column using 0.05% PFPA and 0.01% FA in water (Buffer A) and 50:50 methanol:acetonitrile (Buffer B). A flow rate of 0.60 mL/min was employed with a linear gradient protocol running from 40% B to 99.5% over 1 min, and held for 2.4 min. Four instrument performance standards (Br-phenylalanine, d5-androstene, d9-progesterone, and d4-dioctypthalate) and two process assessment standards (d6-cholesterol and chlorophenylalanine) were used.A third aliquot was analysed in negative ion mode on the C18 column using 6.5 mM ammonium bicarbonate at pH 8 in water (Buffer A) and 95% methanol (Buffer B). A flow rate of 0.35 mL/min was employed with a linear gradient protocol running from 0.5% B to 70% over 4.0 min, rising to 99% B in 0.5 min. Eleven instrument performance standards (d7-glucose, d3-methionine, d3-leucine, d8-phenylalanine, d5-tryptophan, Br-phenylalanine, d15-octanoic acid, d19-decanoic acid, d27-tetradecanoic acid, d35-octadecanoic acid, and d2-eicosanoic acid) and two process assessment standards (tridecanoic acid and chlorophenylalanine) were used. The final aliquot was analysed in negative ion mode using a HILIC column (Waters UPLC BEH Amide 2.1 × 150 mm, 1.7 µm) with a gradient consisting of 10 mM Ammonium Formate, in water:methanol:acetonitrile (15:5:80, Buffer A) and 50% acetonitrile (Buffer B). A flow rate of 0.50 mL/min was employed with a linear gradient protocol running from 5% B to 50% over 3.5 min, rising to 95% B in 2.0 min. Nine instrument performance standards (d35-octadecanoic acid, d5-indole acetate, Br-phenylalanine, d5-tryptophan, d3-serine, d3-aspartic acid, d7-ornithine, and d4-lysine) and two process assessment standards (fluorophenylglycine and chlorophenylalanine) were used. For all sample analysis runs, the MS analysis was performed by within-run switching between MS and data-dependent MSn scans using dynamic exclusion. The scan range varied slighted between methods but covered m/z 70–1000. Raw data were extracted, peak-identified and QC processed using Metabolon’s hardware and software. These systems are built on a web-service platform utilising Microsoft’s.NET technologies, which run on high-performance application servers and fibre-channel storage arrays in clusters to provide active failover and load-balancing. Compounds were identified by comparison to library entries of purified standards or recurrent unknown entities. Biochemical identifications were based on three criteria: retention index within a narrow RI window of the proposed identification, accurate mass match to the library ±10 ppm, and the MS/MS forward and reverse scores between the experimental data and authentic standards.Metabolomics data processing steps were completed using the online Metaboanalyst 5.0 platform (https://www.metaboanalyst.ca/). Data were pre-screened and compounds without identification (i.e. not available within the reference library) or known to be exogenous (e.g. lidocaine) were removed from the dataset. Data were uploaded to the platform as peak area values and features with >50% of missing values were excluded. For compounds where sufficient data points were present, any missing data were imputed as 1/5 of the minimum. A 5% data filter was applied based on IQR values (for non-deviated species) and data were normalised by cube root transformation and pareto scaled. Data normalisation/scaling parameters were optimised and checked before proceeding. A volcano plot comparing up- and down-regulated metabolites in obese vs. non-obese individuals was created using a fold-change threshold of 2.0 and a false discovery rate (FDR) p-value of 0.01, assuming an equal group variance. The volcano plot graphic was produced using the data generated by Metaboanalyst and drawn in GraphPad Prism (v10, GraphPad Software, Boston, MA, USA). Unsupervised multivariate analysis was performed by principal components analysis. Supervised multivariate analysis was performed by orthogonal projections to latent structures-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA). Heat map analyses were conducted by identifying the top 50 correlations (via t-test) and categorised into obese and non-obese individuals. Quantitative Enrichment Analysis (QEA) was performed by inputting the PubChem ID values for all known metabolites alongside a compound concentration table which included the sample phenotype label (i.e. grouping) and metabolite concentration (i.e. peak areas extracted from the metabolomics analyses). Following this,metabolite sets were searched containing at least 2 entries in the SMPDB pathway database. The QEA analysis is performed using the R package globaltest61 which produces a generalised linear model to estimate a Q-statistic for each metabolite set to describe the correlation between metabolite abundance and clinical grouping. Metabolic enrichments were visualised in order of statistical certainty (i.e. lowest p-value first) against a -log10 scale.Statistical methodsData from human obesity studies were analysed using Mann–Whitney U test or Kruskal–Wallis test with Dunn’s multiple comparison test. Correlations between datasets were analysed using Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient. For animal experiments, group sizes of 5 mice were used and data shown are representative of at least 2 independent experiments. Data were analysed using one- or two-way ANOVA test with Bonferroni’s multiple-comparison test. All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 9. Differences were considered significant when P < 0.05.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.

The California condor is the only bird species in the U.S. that has been approved for the new emergency-use vaccine, which was administered this summer to condors bred in captivity during a trial at the Los Angeles Zoo, the San Diego Zoo Safari Park and the Oregon Zoo. Authorities launched the study after the avian influenza deaths earlier this year of 21 free-flying condors in Arizona, part of a Southwest flock usually accounting for a third of the wild population.Wildlife officials feared that the outbreak’s toll on the California condor population could erase any gains made to rebuild the wild population, spurring the efforts to fast-track the vaccine. After 40 years of recovery efforts to prevent the extinction of the iconic vulture with a 10-foot (3-meter) wingspan, the wild population today has fewer than 350 condors in flocks spanning from the Pacific Northwest to Baja California, Mexico. “Losing 20 birds is effectively akin to setting the recovery program back by 10 years,” said Dr. Hendrik Nollens, vice president of wildlife health for the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance.The so-called bird flu reached the U.S. in February 2022 after wreaking havoc across Europe. U.S. agriculture officials consider this year’s cases to be part of last year’s outbreak, which was recorded as the country’s deadliest ever. Authorities confirmed the flu’s presence earlier this month in commercial poultry flocks in South Dakota and Utah, heightening concerns ahead of the spring migratory season. The outbreak cost poultry producers nearly 59 million birds across 47 states, including egg-laying chickens and turkeys and chickens raised for meat. The flu also caused spikes in egg and turkey prices for consumers and cost the federal government more than $660 million. Early results indicate that when 10 condors were vaccinated with half a milliliter (0.016 fluid ounces) on two occasions — an initial injection and a booster administered 21 days later — 60% of the birds showed measurable antibodies expected to protect them from avian flu after exposure.“We’re thankful that we’re getting any immune response,” said Ashleigh Blackford, the California condor coordinator for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.The population was nearly wiped out by hunting during the California Gold Rush in the mid-1800s, as well as by poisoning from toxic pesticide DDT and lead ammunition.In the 1980s, only 22 California condors were left in the wild. They were captured and placed in captive breeding programs to save the species. Zoo-bred birds were first released into the wild in 1992 and in the years since have been reintroduced into habitats from which they had disappeared. The ongoing re-wilding efforts are considered a conservation success.The bird flu trial’s progress will allow wildlife officials to move forward and release roughly two dozen vaccinated condors into the wild in California and Arizona by the end of the year. The government is awaiting additional results before deciding whether free-flying condors should be captured and inoculated. Officials already vaccinate condors in captivity and in the wild for West Nile virus. Dr. Carlos Sanchez, the Oregon Zoo’s director of animal health, said wildlife officials faced questions about undertaking the bird flu vaccine study. “Human intervention, veterinary intervention, is not something we do all the time or take lightly,” he said. “It wasn’t an easy decision.”The shots initially were tested on black vultures to make sure they could be safely injected into condors in managed care beginning in July. The post-inoculation monitoring and testing lasted 42 days and officials said no adverse reactions occurred.Dr. Dominique Keller, the LA Zoo chief veterinarian, said participating in the historic trial was one of her career’s highlights. She hopes the condor study will lead to bird flu vaccines for other endangered species. “It was just so incredible to be the first one to hold the vaccine in my hand and actually give it to the first bird,” she said. The trial’s second test group includes 10 condors vaccinated with one dose of a single milliliter (0.03 fluid ounces). Results from those birds will determine whether condors in the wild will get the shot.“We want to look at the data more holistically before we kind of jump ahead to what’s next,” Blackford said.The condor is intrinsically tied to several Native American tribes in the West and is considered by tribal members to be equal or even superior to humans. The condor disappeared from the Yurok Tribe’s ancestral lands in Northern California in the late 1800s but returned in 2021 after major conservation efforts from a team led by Tiana Williams-Claussen, the tribe’s wildlife department director. Watching the avian flu wipe out 21 birds in Arizona just a few years later was “deeply impactful” to members of the tribe, Williams-Claussen said. The study and vaccine could prevent a repeat of the devastation.“We’re all kind of waiting with bated breath to see what the final results are going to be,” she said.

Water, ink, and paint on paper, 35.25 in x 24.5 in/89.5 cm x 62.23 cm. © Ralph Steadman Art Collections Ltd. Maidstone, Kent, England. A passage from the biographical information on the Ralph Steadman Art Collection website for the British artist and illustrator is revealing. “One of Ralph’s favourite pastimes growing up was to make model aeroplanes. He would rush home from school and would always complete any outstanding homework before allowing himself to indulge in his hobby. This work ethic has remained with him and later, when he began working with Hunter S. Thompson, would lead to no end of irritation to his tall, trans-Atlantic friend when Ralph would often have completed his drawings before Hunter had written a word.” After publication of their best known collaboration, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (first published as a two-part article in Rolling Stone magazine in 1971 and then as a book in 1972), Steadman and Thompson (who was an American journalist and writer who became a counterculture icon) were together catapulted into the popular zeitgeist. A short biographical note on the Tate Museum website states that Steadman “is a British illustrator best known for his collaboration with the American writer Hunter S. Thompson.” However, Steadman’s voluminous portfolio reveals a restless creativity extending well beyond his illustrations linked to Thompson’s “gonzo journalism.” Steadman has created political cartoons for various magazines; scathing caricatures of politicians; British postal stamps; product labels; artwork for album, CD, and DVD covers; and a pair of books on what he calls “boids” (one depicting extinct birds and the other endangered ones). He also illustrated many other books, including a 1967 edition of Alice in Wonderland and an out-of-print (in English) 1995 edition of Animal Farm. Steadman himself is the subject of the 2012 documentary For No Good Reason. In her review for National Public Radio, the late film and art critic Pat Dowell wrote, “Steadman’s drawings are a ferocious tangle of ink blotches and lines that famously distort but also reveal their subjects.” His most recent book, Ralph Steadman: A Life in Ink, is a curated retrospective that spans much of his career. Steadman’s website describes the 300-page book as “a pandemic project,” which was started in November 2019, just before the world learned about the emergence of COVID-19, and which was completed in the fall of 2020 via the online conferencing platforms and file-sharing technologies that provided lifelines for so many people during sustained lockdowns and isolation. Viral Menace, featured on this month’s cover, comes from a small group of works labeled as Steadman’s “Lockdown Portfolio” (S. Williams, Ralph Steadman Art Collection, pers. comm., 2023 Jan 23), In a review of Steadman’s book from the Guardian, journalist Nadja Sayej wrote, “It’s the very last image in the book that sums up 2020. It’s a drawing called Viral Menace, a portrait of COVID-19. It looks like an ink-splatted demon over a sea of blood. A walking nightmare, if there ever was one.” This drawing of a so-called walking nightmare could be seen as a somewhat realistic, if unintentional, depiction of how respiratory viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, are spread through coughing and sneezing. In a 2021 article about how airborne pathogens are transmitted, researchers Linsey C. Marr and Julian W. Tang describe “the transfer of pathogens in respiratory fluid from 1 person to another” via respiratory droplets of various sizes “emitted as part of a turbulent cloud.” In Steadman’s drawing, the viewer is confronted by a distorted, twisted visage, barely recognizable as human, with eyes askew and an arm extended. This central shape floats in a miasmic turbulent cloud, and the malevolent red mist dominates the lower portion of the image. Steadman achieves this splattered effect through his “dirty water technique,” as described by Sayej and others, which involves flinging the leftover water used to clean his paintbrushes onto a clean sheet of paper and letting it dry. He then revisits the spattered paper, which at that point looks like a first pass by Jackson Pollock or an image for a Rorschach test, but it provides a jumping off point for the artist. According to Dowell, Steadman remarked, “You don’t pencil in anything; you just start going and see where it leads you." Steadman’s drawing was an artistic reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. The world is in a different place in 2023, but respiratory viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, influenza virus, and respiratory syncytial virus, still circulate globally, causing substantial morbidity and mortality. Some populations, including older people, young children, pregnant women, and people with underlying health conditions, are more vulnerable to severe disease from those three respiratory viruses. Key public health actions to help mitigate the combined impact of those current viral menaces include vaccinations that protect against COVID-19, influenza, and respiratory syncytial virus, combined with proven nonpharmaceutical measures such as handwashing, wearing masks, and improving indoor ventilation..

A doctor explains By Katia Hetter, CNN 6 minute read Updated 11:57 AM EDT, Wed October 18, 2023 Link Copied! It's generally best to stay home if you have a fever or if you have active, new symptoms. Luke Chan/E+/Getty Images CNN — It’s fall in the Northern Hemisphere, and the weather is getting cooler. Many people have cold-like symptoms, and some may have tested positive for Covid-19, influenza or the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). With winter on the way and viral infections increasing, a lot of people may wonder how long they will be contagious after infection and how long they should take precautions and avoid contact with others. How can someone know if they are still contagious? If so, what’s the average length of time they could transmit viruses such as the coronavirus, influenza, RSV or the common cold to others? And what precautions should an infected person take at school, work and at home? To guide us through these questions, I spoke with our CNN Wellness medical expert, Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. She previously served as Baltimore’s health commissioner. CNN: Is there an easy way to tell if someone is still contagious after having a viral infection? Dr. Leana Wen: Not really. For many viruses, an infected individual is contagious even before they start exhibiting symptoms.

A doctor helps sort it out Also, while there are some tests that can tell you whether you have the virus, they usually aren’t used to clear someone after infection. The exception is Covid-19. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, someone whose symptoms are improving and who has had two negative home coronavirus tests spaced 48 hours apart can end isolation. One more complicating factor here is that many people may continue to have lingering symptoms well after their infectious period ends. It’s common to have a cough, for example, that could last for weeks or even months after a respiratory illness. Such symptoms indicate ongoing airway inflammation but do not reflect ongoing infection or risk to others. CNN: What’s the average length of time someone could transmit the virus to others if they are infected with common viruses like the coronavirus, influenza, RSV or the common cold? Wen: Let’s go through each of these. The virus that causes Covid-19, SARS-CoV-2, can be spread by asymptomatic individuals who are infected but don’t exhibit any of the common symptoms such as cough, fever, runny nose and sore throat. An infected person who has not yet developed symptoms—someone who is presymptomatic—may also be contagious. Scientists estimate that the period of maximal contagiousness for SARS-CoV-2 is in the 48 hours prior to developing symptoms and then the first five days after. The CDC recommends that a person infected with Covid-19 should isolate for five days and then wear a high-quality, well-fitting mask when around people for the next five days, unless they test negative with two consecutive tests, as I mentioned above. Young woman suffering from cold sebra/Adobe Stock Scientists finally know why people get more colds and flu in winter Asymptomatic transmission of influenza is probably less common. While it’s possible that you could spread the flu to others before you develop symptoms, the period of maximal contagiousness is thought to be three to four days after the illness begins. The CDC advises that otherwise healthy adults may be able to infect others up to five to seven days after becoming sick, and some people, like those with weakened immune systems, might be able to infect others for an even longer period of time. RSV has a potentially longer period of contagiousness. Those infected with RSV, which is a very common respiratory infection believed to infect nearly every child before they turn 2, are usually contagious for three to eight days after they develop symptoms, though presymptomatic transmission is possible too. According to the CDC, some infants and people with immunocompromise could keep spreading the virus for as long as four weeks after they stop having symptoms. As for the common cold, there are over 200 viruses that can cause it. The period of infectiousness depends on the virus and on the health of the individual infected, but generally follows a similar pattern to the other viruses discussed. In short, there could be a time before showing symptoms that the person may be contagious, and usually the period of maximal infectiousness is in the three to five days after symptoms begin. However, they may be able to spread the virus for as long as two weeks after infection. CNN: With such long periods of potential infectiousness, what precautions should people with cold-like symptoms take at school and workplaces? Wen: Schools and workplaces have long recognized that it’s unrealistic to ask that people stay home until the entire period during which they could be infectious passes. Even if they had policies asking that people stay out of school or work until, say, two or even four weeks after symptoms resolve, there will still be viral spread because of asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission.

Many schools have policies that try to balance the importance of keeping kids in school with limiting in-person presence during times of maximal infectiousness. For instance, they may ask that parents keep kids home if they have a fever and that there is at least a 24-hour period of being fever-free without the need for fever-reducing medicines before kids return. Sometimes, they may require a doctor’s note if a child continues to have noticeable symptoms, like coughing. Workplaces may have these or other protocols. If you are unsure, ask your human resources department. It’s generally a good idea to stay home if you have a fever and if you first start having active, new symptoms. If you are required to return to work, be sure to wear a well-fitting, high-quality mask in public or shared places to avoid infecting others. CNN: What should people do to prevent infecting those they live with? Wen: This is tricky. Parents of young children know that they often get sick when their kids do because it’s so hard to avoid infection when you are in close contact. Bandage after applying vaccine andreswd/E+/Getty Images Why people who qualify should get the RSV vaccine The key is to identify who in the household is particularly vulnerable to severe outcomes if they were to contract these viruses. If everyone is generally healthy, many families will decide that they won’t take extraordinary steps to isolate someone who has cold-like symptoms. On the other hand, if someone is elderly with serious medical conditions, it would make sense to separate the person who is infected from that individual. Those two people should not dine together or be in the same room for at least a week after symptoms begin. These viral infections are very difficult to avoid, but I do want to emphasize that preventive methods can and do work. Wash your hands or use hand sanitizer often. And be sure to stay up-to-date on your vaccines, including the updated Covid-19 vaccine, the flu shot and, for those 60 and above, the new RSV vaccine. These vaccines, crucially, reduce the risk of severe illness, and they decrease your chance of getting infected with those specific viruses.

Last year only 3 million got their shot.Jennifer Chambers The Detroit NewsAn alarming decrease in vaccinations statewide has primary care physicians and public health leaders fearing the worst about the health threat on its way to Michigan this fall and winter: influenza.Members of the Michigan Academy of Family Physicians spoke Monday during an online roundtable with the media about common influenza misperceptions and urged vaccination for babies, toddlers, teens, adults and the elderly."As flu season approaches, vaccine fatigue remains strong and we need to remember that flu can be fatal for all ages," said Dr. Beena Nagappala, president, Michigan Academy of Family Physicians and medical director of community health at Ascension Southeast Michigan.Flu season started severely last year, with an early hospitalization peak in October 2022, and a season high in cases in December, officials said."Influenza is not the stomach flu and it's also different than the common cold. It’s a respiratory illness and which is what makes it so dangerous," said Nagappala who is already seeing cases of flu in her practice.Doctors from the roundtable said survey data from 2023 shows that people’s intent to become vaccinated against the flu is low overall. The state's goal this flu season is 4 million people vaccinated. Last year only 3 million got their shot."This means only a third of our state was vaccinated," Nagappala said. "The best plan for avoiding flu is to have your family vaccinated now."Getting vaccinated is critical, health officials said, because flu, COVID-19 and RSV frequently spread at the same time of year.Dr. Vincent Winkler-Prins, owner and operator of Table Health-Petoskey Family Practice, which serves a rural population and people who lack access to affordable care in northern Michigan, said on Monday that vaccine rates are 19% points lower for rural children compared to those in urban areas."The downward trend began when, due to COVID, people weren't able to visit their primary care physician for in-person appointments and things like immunizations," Winkler-Prins said. "But now we can connect in person again and the time is overdue."More: How pandemic isolation fueled RSV surge among young children in MichiganDr. Nirali Bora, medical director of the Kent County Health Department, said a common question from the public is when to get the flu vaccine. Mid-November to December is when the flu is expected to peak, officials said, in Michigan."Everyone should be vaccinated by the end of October," Bora said.Asked about the predicted severity of the flu, some physicians on the roundtable said they could not say for sure, but Winkler-Prins said fears are based the number of under-immunized people."People are very worried what while we don't know yet the severity of the current strains, we do worry that we have a larger population at risk and so ultimately the effects could be very significant," Winkler-Prins said.The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services is recommending residents get the flu, COVID-19 and RSV vaccines to protect themselves and their communities against respiratory viruses this upcoming season.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention expects 2023-24 to be similar to 2022-23 in terms of total number of hospitalizations from seasonal respiratory illnesses.During the 2022-23 flu season, the nation recorded 27 to 54 million estimated cases of flu, 12 to 26 million flu medical visits and 19,000 to 58,000 estimated deaths from the flu.Officials said despite its comparison to the common cold, the flu can be a serious and potentially deadly, especially for children, older adults and people with chronic health conditions, which is why vaccination remains a critical strategy for prevention. Vaccination rates among Michigan toddlers are at their lowest level since 2010, with some dropping over 7 percentage points since the COVID-19 pandemic began alone, and experts fear the decrease could lead to a resurgence of preventable diseases.Public health officials have said the trend among 19-month to 36-month-old children in Michigan, detailed in data from the State Care Improvement Registry, is cause for concern and could fuel an uptick of conditions such as measles, mumps and even polio that may spread beyond the state's youngest population.jchambers@detroitnews.com Facebook Twitter EmailHelpTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicySite MapResponsible DisclosureYour Privacy Choices © 2024 The Detroit News, a Digital First Media NewspaperEasing the Healthcare Burden of the Seasonal Triple-demic and Pfizer’s Unwavering Commitment to Public Health | Pfizer Sorry, you need to enable JavaScript to visit this website.

Coined a "triple-demic," the concurrent surge of these three respiratory illnesses not only threatens our individual states of health, but can also place a greater burden on healthcare systems worldwide, diverting resources away from other patients in need. In the 2022-2023 season, millions of people contracted one of the three respiratory illnesses.1-5 In fact, flu peaked at a decade-high rate of hospitalizations,6 overwhelming hospital systems. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) expects the upcoming 2023-2024 season will bring a similar number of total hospitalizations from COVID-19, flu, and RSV as seen last year.7 This “triple-demic” is the result of a complex interplay of factors, each with its own unique challenges. These include: 1. Common Symptoms: All three respiratory viruses can present with fever, cough, runny nose, sore throat, and body aches. This can make it difficult for individuals to differentiate between the diseases and challenging for healthcare providers to diagnose without conducting tests. Testing is often necessary to provide an accurate diagnosis, which then guides appropriate treatment. 2. Transmission Dynamics: COVID-19, flu, and RSV all have similar modes of transmission, primarily through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. These droplets can enter the bodies of nearby people, leading to the spread of these viruses. Close contact typically seen in indoor settings during the winter months can facilitate transmission. 3. Virus Variability: Over time, some viruses might mutate, or change, requiring annual updates to vaccines like flu. This unpredictability can create challenges in creating vaccines that are best suited to combat the viruses in circulation that season. At Pfizer, we believe in comprehensive solutions to tackle the challenges of the “triple-demic” head-on. Our toolbox is not limited to preventative vaccines; we also have diagnostic tools and treatments that can help us ease the burden of respiratory illnesses. At IDWeek 2023—the annual meeting of key professional groups focused on infectious diseases—we presented data highlighting the real-world effectiveness of COVID-19 treatment, along with results from ongoing early- and late-stage studies from anti-infectives in our pipeline. We also presented data from our robust pipeline of COVID-19, flu, and RSV vaccines. I'm particularly proud of my colleagues across the company for all the work they've done leading up to these presentations. Vaccination plays a crucial role in lowering the risk of serious illness. Pfizer has been a leader in vaccine development with proven success in bringing pivotal vaccines to market that help address substantial unmet needs for people of all ages. Our vaccine innovation edge is built on several pillars: our talented teams, clinical development capabilities, a vast manufacturing network, and a diverse vaccine design toolbox. This toolbox allows us to select the right platform technology and the right science for the right pathogen. These strengths enable us to meet the demand for our vaccines and help protect more lives globally. Over the last year, we have achieved remarkable milestones, including multiple vaccine approvals and authorizations from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and a continued progression of our ongoing clinical trials. Our extensive teams of skilled researchers, diverse vaccine design platforms, and robust manufacturing capabilities position us as leaders in the field. I am proud to say we vaccinated over one billion people last year alone. Here are just a few examples of the work we’re doing, which gives me such pride: We achieved FDA approval of the RSV vaccine not only for older adults, but also for the protection of infants through active immunization of pregnant individuals 32-36 weeks of gestational age. Of the three viruses that are associated with the triple-demic, flu has been the most challenging to bring consistent success. We are encouraged by our efforts to date and have an ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial testing the efficacy of an mRNA-based flu vaccine. For COVID-19, we have continued to leverage Pfizer’s nimble manufacturing capabilities of mRNA to adapt our vaccine based on the guidance from key regulatory bodies. Looking to the future, combination vaccines have the potential to simplify immunization practices against these three respiratory pathogens.8 Our ongoing studies aim to advance potential options for combination vaccines targeted towards COVID-19, flu, and RSV. In the coming years, with approvals already in hand and potential approvals on the horizon for our respiratory disease portfolio, we will continue to focus our work on impacting more lives. We remain committed to tackling unmet medical needs and have several programs in clinical studies, evaluating potential combination and standalone vaccines and treatment regimens. As a leader in vaccine research and development, I am excited about the road ahead. The future holds immense promise as we continue to push the boundaries of science and develop solutions to address the world's most pressing healthcare challenges. Together, we can look forward to a future where the fall and winter surges of COVID-19, flu, and RSV may have a lower burden on our healthcare system by preventing serious illness with vaccinations and saving lives by bringing new science to advance the latest treatments.

Learn how to protect your children against this virus. Children need to be protected against influenza. Image courtesy: Adobe Stock Published by Dr Somalika Pal Updated On: 17 Oct 2023, 06:34 pm IST 150 Channel ChannelAccording to doctors, cases of H3N2 flu infections among children below the age of 5 are on the rise. H3N2 is a variant of influenza, a virus that is a significant cause of human influenza. Now as Covid-19 cases are rising in India, there is a surge in the number of children complaining of fever, cough and cold. The majority of them complain of a chronic cough that can continue up to three weeks, as well as very high fevers that last for one to two days and not even responding to paracetamol. With these complaints, quite a large number of children are also experiencing loose motions. In children, H3N2 can cause major complications and takes a little longer to recover. This may even result in respiratory infections or pneumonia, which may necessitate hospitalization and even mortality in severe cases.Is this a new strain?India is seeing a surge in H3N2 cases. According to Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) records, upto 50 per cent of all hospitalizations due to respiratory illnesses is because of the H3N2 strain of the Type A Influenza virus. Influenza is a common respiratory illness caused by the Influenza virus of which there are several types A, B, C, and D. The swine flu H1N1 and the most commonly circulating strain this year H3N2, are common types of Type A influenza and they have been in circulation for a while now.A unique feature of this virus is its ability to undergo minor gradual mutations as well as sudden drastic mutations. This gives the virus the ability to continuously wreak havoc on public health.The influenza virus has been responsible for several dreadful and worse pandemics in the past, just like the Covid-19 pandemic. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that approximately 5-20 per cent of the US population is infected by the flu each year, resulting in over 2 lakh hospitalizations and thousands of fatalities, making it a persistently serious public health issue in the country. It is advised that children, the elderly, and some high-risk groups have routine vaccines against the seasonal flu because India experiences an increase in cases during the rainy or winter months.H3N2 in IndiaIndia is experiencing a sharp increase in H3N2 cases this year, far exceeding the usual annual prevalence rates. Many states, including Delhi, Gujrat, Haryana, Odisha, and Maharashtra, have released a public health advisory.The H3N2 virus is spreading in India. Image courtesy: Adobe StockNonetheless, not all are H3N2. Most often rhinovirus is the common cold infection that causes minor symptoms like runny nose and sneezing. The H1N1 type A influenza virus, adenovirus, and more recently SARS-CoV 2 (Covid-19) are the third most prevalent viruses among hospitalized cases of respiratory disease. It should be kept in mind that there are few viral testing facilities available and that published data only represent a small portion of the total.How do you know whether your child has H3N2?Unfortunately, H3N2 lacks pathognomonic signs and symptoms. It is far more difficult to differentiate between the symptoms of the disease, H3N2, and the common cold, seasonal flu, or even mild cases of Covid-19. High-grade fever, chills, myalgia, sore throat, runny nose, cough, loose stools, and vomiting are some of these symptoms. H3N2 symptoms can become more severe and persistent in certain kids, requiring hospitalization. Lethargy, poor feeding, respiratory issues, chest tightness, or persistent high fever are a few of these.

In India, trivalent and quadrivalent inactivated influenza virus vaccinations are approved for use and advised for all children over the age of six months. Your child will receive two doses of the flu vaccine when receiving it for the first time (often between the ages of 6 months and 1 year), and after that, annual vaccinations are indicated.Every year, a new strain of the vaccine is available, so you should make sure your children have the shot, ideally before flu season starts. The H1NI and H3N2 strains of influenza A as well as 1 or 2 strains of influenza B are covered by the vaccine sold in Indian markets.Make sure your child is vaccinated. Image Courtesy: Shutterstock.Ideally, all individuals should receive an annual flu shot, and those at high risk for serious illness, such as young children under the age of 5, elderly people over 65, pregnant women, or people with chronic medical conditions like diabetes or immunocompromised, should absolutely and strongly be recommended doing so. It is wise for all adults to get immunized during epidemics like the one we are presently experiencing so that those at risk are protected from exposure.Get latest updates on health and wellness along with Preventive Care, Family Care, Reproductive Care, Self Care About The Author Dr Somalika Pal Dr Somalika Pal, Senior Consultant, Department of Neonatology and Paediatrics, Cloudnine Group of Hospitals, New Delhi (East of Kailash)Related Stories Best puzzle games for kids: 6 top picks for your child’s development Health Shots Recommends 7 best exercises to manage diabetes Photo Gallery Amazon Prime Day Sale 2024: Top deals on best baby products with up to 70% off Health Shots Recommends Starting a new diabetes treatment? 10 questions to ask your doctor Family CarePhoto Gallery 7 foods to reduce cholesterol levels Photo Gallery 7 healthy juices to burn belly fat Photo Gallery 7 healthy Diwali snacks for a guilt-free celebration Photo Gallery Next Story MIND Emotional Health Happiness Hacks Mental HealthINTIMATE HEALTH Feminine Hygiene Menstruation Sexual HealthBEAUTY Hair Care Natural Cures Skin CaresFITNESS Muscle Gain Weight Loss Staying FitPREVENTIVE CARE Family Care Reproductive Care Self CareHEALTHY EATING Nutrition Recipes SuperFoodsWEB STORIESHEALTH HOROSCOPEHOW TOMOM SAYSSHE SLAYSPODCASTSVIDEOSHEALTH NEWSNEWSLETTERSTOOLS Period Tracker Nutrimeter QuizTRENDING TOPICSWeight Loss Home remedies Healthy Foods Diabetes Skin Care Hair LossSUBSCRIBE TO OUR WELLNESS NEWSLETTER Get your Daily Dose of Wellness in your Inbox !DOWNLOAD APP FOLLOW US ON LATEST STORIES Shocked by overnight weight gain?

(Joe Raedle/Getty Images) The Alabama Department of Public Health (ADPH) said Thursday that respiratory virus cases are manageable as the cold and flu season begins. “Our respiratory virus season is upon us, and we’ve spent a lot of time talking about that,” said State Health Officer Dr. Scott Harris said to state committee board members of the ADPH Thursday. Harris said that statewide influenza-like activity is about 2.5% of patient visits to healthcare providers for any influenza-like illness reported each week, a minimal activity level according to the CDC. The Southeast region has relatively low activity rates. Alaska with the highest rate of influenza like illnesses. Around the same time last year, the influenza-like illness activity level was about 5%. According to the CDC, Alabama had the second-highest per capita death rate from flu in the country in 2021, with 16.8 deaths per 100,000 people. Only Mississippi had a higher rate of death from the flu that year. GET THE MORNING HEADLINES. SUBSCRIBE The state health officer also said about 120 people in the state are currently hospitalized with COVID-19. Harris said that caseload was manageable. That is far below the Jan. 2021 peak, when the state averaged nearly 3,000 hospitalizations a week. Some of those patients, he said, are hospitalized with COVID, but first arrived at the hospital with another condition. From a hospital standpoint, they still have to treat those patients the same way. They’ve still got to isolate these patients, Harris said. “It’s still an issue for hospitals, but in terms of actually saying what morbidity is caused by COVID itself, it’s certainly not all that,” he said. According to data reported on Oct. 14, the percentage of RSV tests that detected the virus via an antigen, or rapid, test was 11.3%, significantly up from .6% in mid-July. The last time that rate was above 10% was in November last year. About 8% of Alabamians are up-to-date on their COVID vaccines, meaning they received the bivalent COVID booster, according to the CDC. The national average is about 17%. ADPH embarked in a “Ask Your Doctor” campaign to encourage people to talk to their physicians about getting vaccinated against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), COVID-19 and the flu, the three major viruses for which there are now vaccines. The department also encouraged people to discuss the pneumonia vaccine with their doctors. With the approval of the RSV vaccine in May, Harris said health care professionals for the first time have vaccines to fight the three major respiratory illnesses that have harmed public health the most. RSV often gives people mild cold-like symptoms. Most recover within a week or two, but it can be severe, especially for infants and older adults. Right now, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the new RSV vaccine for adults over 60 and children under 2 years old, as well as people who are 32-36 weeks pregnant to protect their babies from severe RSV. “RSV is one of those things that we have never thought a lot about, simply because we didn’t really have any tools to fight it,” Harris said. “We know it’s fairly common, particularly for folks that are vulnerable in that way.” He said that infants and babies should get one vaccine dose as they approach their first RSV season, unless the mother was immunized during pregnancy. If the mother received the vaccine at least the weeks before birth, the baby should also have that protection, but there’s no problem with immunizing a baby whose mom has had the vaccine. It is also recommended that high risk children get a second RSV vaccine a year later. Besides the RSV vaccine, there is a monoclonal treatment for those who get infected. YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE.

Research shows that while outbreaks in 2016 and 2017 started in China, two new H5 viruses emerged in 2020 in African poultry and in 2022 in European wild birds.“These results highlight a shift in the HPAI [highly pathogenic avian influenza] H5 epicentre beyond Asia,” researchers write in the paper published in Nature.The latest outbreak of the highly infectious variant of H5N1 caused Europe’s worst bird flu outbreak, before spreading globally. It has now reached every continent except Oceania and Antarctica, killing record numbers of domestic and wild birds, and even jumping into mammals. It can also jump to humans: since 2003, H5N1 was found in 873 humans, resulting in 458 deaths, according to the World Heath Organization. Most cases were linked to the handling of infected poultry, and it is not known to be able to transmit from human to human.‘Tears were rolling down my face’: readers describe ‘heartbreaking’ impact of bird flu Read moreAn international team of scientists led by the University of Hong Kong analysed outbreaks between 2005 and 2022, collecting data on confirmed cases from the Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Organisation for Animal Health. They also studied 10,000 sets of viral DNA.Despite the number of outbreaks, only 0.2% of cases were sequenced, researchers said, and urged countries to increase surveillance to understand how the virus is changing. Monitoring infrastructure is particularly weak in Africa, they said. The authors suggest the increasing persistence of avian flu in wild birds is driving the evolution and spread of new strains.Bird flu is highly infectious, with scientists saying one bird can infect as many as 100, with the virus present in faeces, mucus, blood and saliva. UK government authorities say more than 99% of cases in poultry in the UK have come from wild birds.Mass culling used to be an effective policy to control the disease’s spread in poultry, but because avian flu is now so widespread in wild bird populations, this is proving less effective.The spread of bird flu within the poultry industry is determined by human activity and how birds are traded. In wild birds, migratory flyways are key indicators of where the disease will spread, with key migration routes along the east Atlantic and Pacific flyways, meaning it has been able to spread to new areas that have never been exposed to it before.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Everyone over 6 months of age will also be able to get updated shots to protect against COVID-19 and influenza.RSV is one of the most common causes of childhood respiratory illness and the leading cause of hospitalization among babies in the U.S. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), approximately 80,000 children younger than 5 years old, most of them babies, are hospitalized each year due to RSV infection, with some requiring oxygen, IV fluids, or mechanical ventilation. In late 2022, a surge of RSV infections overwhelmed hospitals with babies and young kids who hadn’t been exposed to the virus during the COVID-19 lockdown.Roshni Mathew, MD, and Hayden Schwenk, MD, pediatric infectious diseases specialists at Stanford Medicine Children’s Health, answer questions that parents have about the monoclonal antibody shot for RSV and other vaccines that are important to get heading into respiratory virus season.RSV antibody shot to protect babies and kidsIn California, RSV season typically runs from November through March. There are two monoclonal antibody products approved for use in infants and children: nirsevimab (Beyfortus) and palivizumab (Synagis).Nirsevimab is recommended for all infants younger than 8 months born during or entering their first RSV season. It is also recommended for some children between the ages of 8 and 19 months who are at high risk of RSV illness, like those who are severely immunocompromised and who are entering their second RSV season. One dose of nirsevimab is expected to protect infants for at least 5 months, which is about the length of an average RSV season.Palivizumab is approved for children under 24 months of age with certain conditions that place them at high risk for severe RSV disease. This must be given once a month during RSV season.Antibodies are part of our immune system and help us fight infections. Monoclonal antibodies are made to look like the antibodies produced in the human body and mimic the immune system response.“These shots are an important tool to protect our children against the threat of RSV,” Dr. Schwenk says. “For a very young infant, this method of protection is an advantage. The shots contain ready-made antibodies, which means they start working as soon as they’re given.”An updated COVID-19 vaccine for the fall and winterWhile the global COVID-19 pandemic has been declared over, the nation is seeing more cases as fall begins. The CDC is recommending an updated COVID-19 vaccine for everyone 6 months and older. “COVID is still very much in circulation and will likely have an uptick during the winter months,” Dr. Mathew says. “That’s why it’s still important to check in with your child’s pediatrician to see what they need to protect themselves against potentially serious outcomes of illness.”Even if your child has recently been infected with COVID, the shots still provide additional protection. Updated COVID vaccines are designed to target the variants currently circulating.“From the experience over the past few years, we know that one can get reinfected with COVID-19,” Mathew adds. “COVID vaccines have been shown to provide the most long-lasting protection, both in people who have and who have not had COVID infection previously.”The vaccine requirement depends on the child’s age and how many COVID-19 vaccines they’ve already received. It’s important to check with your child’s pediatrician to see what they need to be up to date.Protecting your child from the fluThe influenza virus changes constantly, so vaccines are updated every season. Additionally, protection from influenza vaccine declines over time, which makes it important to get the flu shot every year.“It’s especially important for children 6 months and older to get the flu shot,” Dr. Mathew says. “Children younger than 5 years old, and especially those under 2, are at higher risk of influenza-related complications. Infants younger than 6 months are at highest risk for hospitalization, but there are no approved vaccines for this age group. It is thus important for their caregivers and other members of the household to be vaccinated as well as take other preventative actions to protect this vulnerable population.”Parents can start by asking their child’s pediatrician, who may offer these vaccines in their office. Additionally, many local pharmacies are expected to provide COVID, flu, and RSV shots. Other than shots, some ways to protect against acquiring RSV and other respiratory viruses include washing hands, avoiding close contact with anyone who is sick, wearing a mask, and cleaning commonly touched surfaces.Related Posts Helping Kids and Families Cope with COVID-19As COVID-19 continues to spread, Stanford Medicine Children’s experts have advice about communicating with children… Protecting Your Kids from Colds and FluPediatric advice for keeping your family healthy this cold and flu season.

How long do flu shot side effects last?When should I get the flu shot?Should immunocompromised people get a flu shot?How to treat flu shot side effectsWhen should you see a doctor about flu shot side effects?Flu season is upon us again, so let’s set the record straight: The flu shot can’t give you the flu. Still, like any vaccine or medication, your annual jab does come with the potential of flu shot side effects. In most cases, this translates to a sore arm, but there’s even a chance you won’t experience that. “The majority of patients really don’t have any side effects,” says Sandra Kemmerly, M.D., system medical director for hospital quality at Ochsner Health System in New Orleans. And when symptoms do occur, they’re usually mild and clear up in a day or two, she says.Basically, flu shot side effects are not something to stress over. Instead, you should be concerned about what could happen if you don’t get your flu shot, like the risk of getting seriously ill from influenza. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that somewhere between 12,000 and 52,000 people have died each flu season between 2010 and 2020. It makes sense to want to know what you could (potentially) be in for. Here are the most common side effects of the flu shot, how long you can expect your possible side effects to last, and how to treat them, per experts. Flu shot side effectsMost of these possible reactions to your flu shot are completely normal and nothing to worry about, but some rare complications are definitely worth bringing up with your doctor. Here are some of the more common, and some very rare, side effects you can expect: Soreness or aching in your armYour arm might be sore or uncomfortable after getting the shot, but this is a good thing: It means your immune system is responding to the vaccine and creating antibodies, says Dr. Kemmerly. Plus, it’s usually “one day of discomfort,” says Claudia Vicetti, M.D., a pediatric infectious disease specialist with UnityPoint Health in Cedar Falls, IA. She adds, “and not everybody gets that [side effect].”Redness, pain, or swelling at the injection siteThis is another good sign that your immune system is raring to go and responding to the vaccine properly, Dr. Kemmerly says. Plus, any time something breaks the skin barrier (like a needle), it may get red and swollen as your body reacts to it as a foreign object. This side effect is common and should only last a few days.Low-grade feverExperiencing a low-grade fever (below 101 degrees) after the flu shot is possible, but it’s not very common. If it’s any higher than that, you may already be sick with another virus that commonly circulates during flu season. A person might catch a cold, for example, or RSV (respiratory syncytial virus, a common childhood illness).Oftentimes, people delay getting a flu shot until flu season is in full swing, Dr. Kemmerly points out. They were already “incubating” the flu virus and “then, lo and behold, they got the flu—but totally unrelated to the flu shot,” she says.Nausea, headaches, or fatigueThese are all totally normal reactions as your body responds to the flu vaccine, the CDC says.Dizziness or faintingLike any other vaccine, some people may experience dizziness or fainting after getting a flu shot, but this has much more to do with the process—getting a needle poked into your arm—than the vaccine itself, the CDC says. The organization emphasizes that nearly all vaccines receive reports of people fainting afterward, so it’s not unique to the flu shot alone.Coughing or sneezing The nasal flu vaccine, the type your child might get if he or she doesn’t have asthma or a recent history of wheezing, can cause some of the same side effects as the flu shot—minus the sore arm—plus some additional ones. “There can be some coughing and sneezing,” Dr. Kemmerly notes, “but for the most part people feel pretty good.”Sore throatWhile the flu shot is unlikely to give you a sore throat, the CDC says that you may experience this side effect with the nasal flu vaccine. If you happen to experience this side effect, it will usually happen soon after you get vaccinated and be mild and short-lived. Guillan-Barré syndromeGuillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is a neurologic condition that attacks your body’s nerve cells, in turn causing muscle weakness or paralysis in severe cases. This rare condition got attention in 2021 after the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) shared that there is an “observed increased risk” of the condition after people were vaccinated with the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine. Based on an analysis of Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting (VAERS) data, there were 100 preliminary reports of GBS after 12.5 million doses were given of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, the FDA said. Of those, 95 were serious and required hospitalization, and one person died. But that was for the COVID-19 vaccine—not the flu vaccine. There are people who do develop serious side effects after getting the flu vaccine, including GBS. (These people fall on the list of people who should not get a flu shot.) The condition is extremely rare. In fact, for every 1 million flu shots given, only one or two of those people will develop GBS, the CDC states. Each year, an estimated 3,000 to 6,000 people develop GBS of any cause in the U.S.Can people have allergic reactions to the flu shot? Allergic reactions can occur with any vaccine including influenza, though these reactions are very rare, says infectious disease expert Amesh A. Adalja, M.D., senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. There are people who may experience an allergic reaction to the flu vaccine or its components, such as gelatin, antibiotics, or other ingredients. The CDC says that signs of a severe allergic reaction can include difficulty breathing, wheezing, swelling around the eyes or lips, hives, high fever, and a fast heartbeat. Can the flu shot trigger a dangerous reaction?Life-threatening reactions to the flu shot are extremely rare. “I’ve been practicing for 30 years. I’ve never seen an anaphylactic reaction to the flu shot,” says Dr. Kemmerly. Dr. Finkel agrees that life-threatening allergic reactions to flu shots are “very rare,” but it’s still possible to have an allergic reaction to an ingredient in the vaccine. Signs of serious allergic reaction can include breathing problems, hoarseness or wheezing, hives, paleness, weakness, a fast heartbeat, or dizziness, Dr. Finkel says. “If they do occur, it is usually within a few minutes to a few hours after receiving the shot.” (If you happen to have any of those symptoms, seek medical care ASAP, she says.)⚠️ If you’ve had a life-threatening allergic reaction to the flu shot in the past, you should not get the vaccine.If you have an egg allergy, you can still get vaccinated, the CDC says, but it should be done in a controlled setting where you can be monitored. In this case, talk to your doctor about your egg allergy so you can both make an informed decision about your vaccine.Why do some people feel sick after the flu shot while others don’t? Doctors say reactions to the flu vaccine differ from person to person and that multiple factors are likely at play.Think about how people respond to the common cold. Some folks get a runny nose and go on with their lives, while others stay home with a fever or develop a cough. It’s the same with the flu shot, says Dr. Vicetti. “You’re stimulating your body, and your immune system may react in different ways,” she says.“The flu” isn’t a single virus. Each season, a new vaccine is developed to match circulating strains. Getting a flu vaccine can protect you against the same or related viruses in the vaccine, but it won’t cover every possible strain that a person might encounter, the CDC explains. This year’s vaccine will target the following strains:an A/Victoria/4897/2022 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus; an A/Darwin/9/2021 (H3N2)-like virus; a B/Austria/1359417/2021-like virus (B/Victoria lineage) a B/Phuket/3073/2013-like virus (B/Yamagata lineage)Even though it is not 100% effective, getting a flu shot is the best way to protect yourself from getting sick, and can significantly lower your chances of winding up in the hospital. It is important to get vaccinated before the end of October, so your body has time to build up immunity. Once you do get the vaccine, you may be one of the rare few that feels a bit crummy afterward, but it shouldn’t last very long. Here are the flu shot side effects to know, when you should and shouldn’t worry, and how to feel better once side effects hit.How long do flu shot side effects last?It really depends. Typically “they last a few hours to a few days,” says Diana Finkel, D.O., an associate professor of infectious diseases at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School.Still, “duration varies from person to person,” says Dr. Adalja. Just know this, he adds: “If side effects persist for several days and are more than just injection site pain and slight achiness, there may be another illness present.”When should I get the flu shot?The CDC and public health officials generally recommend that you try to get your flu shot before Halloween. But, if you can’t make that deadline, Dr. Adalja says it’s best to just get it as soon as you can. Flu activity is already jumping up across the country, so this is definitely something you want to do sooner rather than later. Should immunocompromised people get a flu shot?Everyone above the age of 6 months will benefit from influenza vaccine, says Dr. Adalja. “The biggest benefits, however, are in the very old, the very young, those who are immunocompromised, those with underlying medical conditions, and pregnant women,” he adds. So in other words, those who are immunocompromised should absolutely get their shot when they can.How to treat flu shot side effectsTylenol Rapid Release GelsNow 25% Off$12 at AmazonAgain, flu shot side effects are usually minor, if you have them at all. But if you’re uncomfortable, try these self-care measures to feel better ASAP:For muscle aches, headache, or flu-like symptoms, take a pain reliever, such as Tylenol or ibuprofen.For arm pain after the flu shot, apply a cool compress.The same goes for side effects of the nasal flu vaccine. Treatment is based on a person’s symptoms, Dr. Kemmerly says. All in all, minor aches are a small price to pay for the vast protection the flu vaccine provides for both you and those around you. When should you see a doctor about flu shot side effects?If a person has continuous pain, severe rash, or swelling, they should seek medical attention, says Dr. Adalja. Additionally, as we mentioned above, if you experience any signs of an allergic reaction to the vaccine, be sure to contact your doctor ASAP.Related Stories5 Myths About Colds and Flu, DebunkedHow Does the Flu Spread?Is the Nasal Flu Vaccine the Best Choice for You?Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowCold & Flu Season7 Ways to Get Over the Flu Faster16 Best Foods to Eat When You Feel SickSigns Your Cold Might Be Getting BetterHow to Check for a Fever Without a ThermomerAdvertisement - Continue Reading BelowCan Mucinex Help You Get Pregnant?FDA Approves New Home Flu VaccineCDC Warns About Flu Deaths in KidsSo, When Is the Best Time for a Flu Shot?Natural Ways to Ease NauseaHow to Get Rid of a Lingering CoughGenius Home Remedies to Soothe a Sore Throat ASAPHow to Break a Fever ASAPAdvertisement - Continue Reading BelowAbout Prevention.comNewsletterPress RoomGive A GiftCommunity GuidelinesSubscribeMedia KitAdvertise OnlineOther Hearst SubscriptionsCustomer ServiceA Part of Hearst Digital MediaWe may earn commission from links on this page, but we only recommend products we back.©2024 Hearst Magazines, Inc.

Wild birds can spread avian influenza to domestic flocks.Thousands and thousands of snow geese off Storm Lake's Scout Park. Wild geese are believed to be the main carriers of avian influenza.Absent for seven months, bird flu has again resurfaced in Iowa, hitting a commercial turkey facility in Buena Vista County and resulting in the destruction of 50,000 birds, the Iowa Department of Agriculture said Friday.The news comes as poultry producers have braced for fall migration, which can bring infections with highly pathogenic avian influenza. Wild birds, in particular waterfowl, can spread the virus to domestic flocks, often without showing signs of illness themselves.Gov. Kim Reynolds issued a disaster proclamation for Buena Vista County Friday to help state and federal agencies respond to the outbreak. The proclamation allows agencies to assist with "tracking and monitoring, rapid detection, containment, disposal and disinfection."State and federal officials require the area around an infected facility to be quarantined and poultry tested. Infected flocks are killed to prevent the spread of the deadly, highly contagious disease.The last case to hit an Iowa flock was in March, infecting about 50 backyard birds in Chickasaw County. The current outbreak, which began in 2022, has resulted in the destruction of roughly 16 million laying hens, turkeys and other birds in Iowa.Iowa, the nation's top egg producer, tops the nation in birds destroyed during the long outbreak.Nationally, 59.4 million birds have been destroyed, U.S. Department of Agriculture data shows, making it the single largest foreign animal disease outbreak in U.S. history. Since last year, Iowa has had 33 episodes of bird flu, while nationally, there have been 860.The outbreak caused egg prices to spike last year to record highs. But the USDA said prices have dropped 38% since their peak and are expected to climb just 0.1% this year.More: Bird flu outbreak has slowed in 2023, but Iowa poultry producers remain fearfulIowa Agriculture Secretary Mike Naig on Oct. 11 urged producers to tighten security measures to protect their flocks, given recent outbreaks in South Dakota and Minnesota.“Unfortunately, highly pathogenic avian influenza continues to be an active threat to our state’s turkey producers, egg layers, and backyard flocks,” Naig said in a statement. “We encourage everyone to remain vigilant, review their biosecurity plans and ensure they are fully implemented.“Prevention of disease is always our goal, but should we face new cases, our team at the Iowa Department of Agriculture ... working jointly with USDA and industry partners, is ready to swiftly respond,” Naig said.According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, the recent infections in birds do not present a public health concern, and it remains safe to eat poultry products.Donnelle Eller covers agriculture, the environment and energy for the Register.

Facebook Twitter Instagram RSS Email HEALTH After losing her leg to the flu, Virginia woman urges people to get vaccinated: ‘Don’t waste time’ Allison Miller was a healthy 33-year-old when the flu led to ‘life-altering’ bacterial pneumonia By Melissa Rudy Fox News Published October 18, 2023 3:45am EDT Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video Fox News Flash top headlines for October 17 Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. For most of the millions of people who get the flu each year in the U.S., the virus brings a few days of fever, body aches and weakness before it goes away. But for some, the influenza virus can lead to severe illness, hospitalization — even death.Allison Miller knows these risks all too well. This year marks a decade since serious complications from the flu led to a life-changing loss for the Virginia-based communications director. HAVE A COLD OR FLU? HERE'S HOW TO KNOW IF YOU CAN STILL WORK OUT: ‘USE THE NECK CHECK’ At age 33, Miller was a healthy young woman when she came down with a sore throat and headache. When her symptoms got worse, she went into urgent care for a chest X-ray, but it showed nothing alarming. A decade ago, Allison Miller (pictured) experienced serious complications from the flu, which led to a life-changing loss. (Allison Miller/iStock)"It looked like it was just some sort of run-of-the-mill stuff — they gave me some prescription cough syrup and said to let them know if it got worse," she said in an interview with Fox News Digital. Back at home that night, Miller started feeling worse — and began having intense back pain."Thinking it was the flu or something I could get over, I kept waiting to turn the corner — like, this is the worst of it. It'll get better. And clearly that wasn't the case," she said. SKELETONS FROM 1918 FLU PANDEMIC REVEAL CLUES ABOUT THOSE MOST LIKELY TO DIE, STUDY FINDS The next morning, when the back pain was causing her to have periodic blackouts, Miller managed to call a friend, who came over and called an ambulance. That’s where Miller's memory stops."I remember being loaded into the ambulance — and then I really don't remember a whole lot after that for about three weeks to a month thereafter," she said. "It just escalated very quickly." Today, in what Miller refers to as her "new normal," she wears a prosthesis and — with the help of "very qualified people" — has learned to walk again and to "navigate the world and all of its terrain." (Allison Miller) As Miller would later learn, her influenza had caused bilateral bacterial pneumonia — which affects both lungs and is more severe than viral pneumonia.This led to sepsis, which quickly turned to septic shock. "All of my organs were shutting down," Miller said. "Within a short amount of time, I was in the ICU and they were doing everything they could. But ultimately, my last best chance was to be put on life support.""I had missed the memo that flu vaccines were for everyone, and being 33 at the time and otherwise healthy, it didn't even register as something I should consider doing." After five days, Miller experienced a rare complication. "A known complication of that form of life support is amputation," she told Fox News Digital. "Some patients lose blood circulation, and that's what happened to me."Ultimately, doctors had to amputate Miller’s left leg above the knee — all while she was still in a medically induced coma. Miller has been able to get back to the things that she loves to do, such as traveling the world and not feeling limited by her disability. (Allison Miller) "By the time I came out of it, it had been three weeks. I awoke in a very hazy position — and I didn’t have a left leg," she recalled.She spent another two months in the hospital and then had to do weeks of inpatient rehabilitation. Today, in what Miller refers to as her "new normal," she wears a prosthesis and — with the help of "very qualified people" — has learned to walk again and to "navigate the world and all of its terrain." DOCTORS URGE VACCINATIONS AHEAD OF THIS YEAR'S FLU SEASON, WHICH COULD BE 'FAIRLY BAD,' EXPERTS SAYMiller has been able to get back to the things that she loves to do, such as traveling the world, without feeling limited by her disability. "It's just different, and I have learned to adapt and adjust," she said. In addition to the amputation, Miller still suffers from permanent lung damage and below-average heart function. The more severe complications of flu are often markedly reduced for those who get an influenza vaccine, a doctor told Fox News Digital. (Nicolas Maeterlinck/Belgia/AFP via Getty Images)"There was some permanent organ damage because of the strain of the virus, as it was such a severe case of pneumonia," she said. "I have a terminal lung condition that needs regular treatment."She added, "It's manageable, but it's something I will forever deal with." The experience has given Miller a "renewed sense of how quickly things could change" — and has taught her to be as proactive as possible about her health to prevent a terrible outcome."A viral illness like influenza can set you up for something more serious further on." Overall, Miller said she thinks most people don’t understand how severe the flu can be — so they don’t recognize the signs that they need immediate medical attention."In my case, it was very quick — it was within 24 to 48 hours that it went from just coming on, to me being in the hot seat." Now, Miller is looking to spread awareness of the importance of getting the flu vaccine, which she did not get that year. The CDC recommends that everyone 6 months and older get a flu vaccine every season, with rare exceptions. (REUTERS/Andrew Kelly/File Photo)"I had missed the memo that flu vaccines were for everyone, and being 33 at the time and otherwise healthy, it didn't even register as something I should consider doing," she said. "If there's anything you can do proactively to minimize the risk of something that severe happening to you, you absolutely should do it, I think." FLU PREVENTION TIPS FROM FLORIDA'S SURGEON GENERAL: A 'DAY-TO-DAY’ HEALTHY LIFESTYLE IS KEYMiller acknowledges that the vaccine doesn’t guarantee that someone won't get the flu, but noted that "it's more of a continuum, rather than either you're sick or you're not."She said, "You still might get it, but you may not end up in the ICU like I did … Considering the benefits that you could get and what the extreme, worst outcome could be, it is an easy thing to do that is proven to make a tremendous difference for people," she added. In addition to getting yearly vaccines, Miller takes steps to minimize her exposure and makes healthy lifestyle choices, such as eating nutritious foods and exercising. During the 2021-2022 influenza season, the CDC estimates that there were nine million illnesses, four million medical visits, 10,000 hospitalizations and 5,000 deaths related to the flu. (iStock) Dr. Gregg Sylvester, chief health officer at CSL Seqirus, a New Jersey biopharmaceutical company, noted that while Miller’s experience is not typical of most women in her age range, "it probably occurs more often than we know."The flu triggers inflammation of the respiratory tract, Sylvester said, which causes it to become irritated and can allow secondary or bacteria to enter. COVID-19, FLU AND RSV VACCINES ARE ALL AVAILABLE THIS FALL: SEE WHAT SOME DOCTORS RECOMMEND AND WHY "A viral illness like influenza can set you up for something more serious further on," he warned. "That's why it's so important to get a vaccine."The more severe complications of flu often are markedly reduced for those who get an influenza vaccine, according to the doctor. "It's important to seek care early, especially if symptoms start to change dramatically," a doctor told Fox News Digital. (iStock) "You still may end up getting infected, but your symptoms will be milder," he said. "And hopefully, your respiratory tract will be in a little bit better shape."Mid-October is the "perfect time" to get a flu vaccine, Sylvester said, as he noted that the U.S. is starting to see an upswing in cases.

It's so much more than that. And it can be life-altering."She continued, "If you're sick and the symptoms are severe, don't waste time wondering if you should seek medical attention. Listen to your body — it’s better to go in proactively, rather than regret it later." Miller's influenza caused bilateral bacterial pneumonia, which affects both lungs and is more severe than viral pneumonia.

(Photo courtesy of Julia Kleinschmit) Listen To This Story The bird flu wave that’s left around 60 million chickens and turkeys dead nationwide can also infect and kill pets like cats and dogs, along with other mammals.Six cats have died in Nebraska, Wyoming and Oregon and at least one dog in Canada. The U.S. Department of Agriculture reports 170 mammals have picked up the disease during the latest outbreak, mostly wild foxes and skunks. (Photo courtesy of the U.S. Department of Agriculture) Cases are extremely rare but can be fatal.“I think maybe we were waiting for this moment to happen,” said Nichola Hill, an ecologist at the University of Massachusetts Boston. “There have been documented cases in domestic cats and dogs now that have been linked to predation on dead birds, as tends to be the habit of dogs and cats. They’re predators too.”Hill said keeping pets away from wildlife is the best way to protect them.“This is a real call to action that we’re seeing this so close to home,” she said. “If you’re walking your dog, keep them on a leash. I have an indoor cat – I love cats, but I also love birds. And so I just keep them in different spaces.”Sarah Sillman studies animal diseases and examined the three infected cats in Nebraska at the state’s veterinary diagnostic center.The cats lived on rural farm acreages and likely ate birds infected with the disease, quickly becoming lethargic and developing breathing problems and gunky eyes.The owners and veterinarians were worried they’d been exposed to a toxin like rat poison, until biopsies showed the presence of avian influenza.Sillman said the disease also causes neurological damage that made it difficult for the cats to move as they experienced tremors, seizures and trouble walking.“It’s a pretty significant disease for the cats that are affected. All the cases that I’ve encountered have been fatal,” she said. “But there’s millions of cats in the United States, and we only have a handful of confirmed cases. It’s very rare.”It’s even rarer for the disease to pass to humans, according to poultry veterinarian David Swayne. Since 1997, Swayne said there have been 874 reported cases of humans contracting the disease. Symptoms are typically flu-like, but about 40% of those cases have been fatal.“Something that helps me sleep at night is that this virus is watched very closely by public health agencies around the globe,” he said. “And to this point, the virus has not passed a threshold of being transmissible human to human. In 20 years of watching, it hasn’t happened.”This story was produced in partnership with Harvest Public Media, a collaboration of public media newsrooms in the Midwest. It reports on food systems, agriculture and rural issues.

Skip to main content Back to main site ENFR Main navigation - Vaccineswork About COVID-19 Stories News History Emerging Threats Opinions Search Vaccineswork - Search Search Main navigation - Vaccineswork About COVID-19 Stories News History Emerging Threats Opinions Search News from the lab Cross-postsVaccine developmentInnovation Beyond COVID vaccines: what else could mRNA technology do for our health? The goal of mRNA technology is to harness the power of the cell to potentially prevent infections and treat diseases. 19 October 2023 5 min read by The Conversation Credit: nobeastsofierce/Shutterstock Many people first became familiar with the term “mRNA” when Pfizer’s and Moderna’s COVID vaccines were rolled out. In the simplest terms, mRNA, which stands for messenger ribonucleic acid, is a type of genetic material that gives cells in our bodies instructions to make specific proteins.More recently the 2023 Nobel prize in physiology or medicine was awarded to Katalin Karikó and Drew Weissman from the University of Pennsylvania for their discoveries in mRNA biology.These scientists’ work has underpinned multiple successful COVID vaccines, which undoubtedly shifted the course of the pandemic. But their discoveries have likewise opened the door to a range of possible therapeutics which, until recently, remained elusive.The promise of mRNAWithin each of our cells are ribosomes, micro-machines that manufacture proteins, which in turn make up everything from muscle and bone to enzymes and hormones.mRNA is the intermediate chemical “message” that carries the genetic code locked in the chromosomes of our DNA to the cytoplasm, the fluid that fills our cells and where proteins are made.The ability to deliver genetic information directly into a cell has been one of medicine’s most obstinate challenges. While mRNA was theoretically the most attractive way to achieve this, it was of little use as a therapy. This is because our immune system mistakes the foreign RNA as being an invading virus, mounting a powerful and toxic immune response. Injecting naked mRNA therefore can make you very sick.So it was pivotal when Karakó and Weissman pioneered a technique to “cloak” mRNA from the immune system, alongside lipid nanoparticles to protect the RNA and allow it to be delivered safely to our cells. COVID vaccines have shown us the potential of mRNA technology.Credit: Siyanight/Shutterstock This paved the way for mRNA COVID vaccines which instruct our cells to make spike proteins, proteins on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID). This is turn primes our immune system to make anti-spike antibodies that then block SARS-CoV-2 from infecting our cells.Have you read?After COVID-19, can mRNA vaccines help with cancer as well?Pancreatic cancer: a personalised mRNA vaccine may boost effects of treatmentQ&A: Start talking about mRNA vaccine access now, say expertsTheir discovery has opened up new possibilities for how we treat common infectious illnesses as well as genetic diseases that have previously defied treatment.Flu vaccinesInfluenza kills up to 650,000 people globally each year. At the moment, seasonal vaccines need to be made annually once the main circulating strain has been identified. Manufacture takes about six months, by which time the original flu strain may have evolved. At best the seasonal vaccine is about 60% effective.We need a better vaccine and mRNA technology offers the potential of a universal influenza vaccine, with multiple candidates currently undergoing human clinical trials. A vaccine, if successful, could replace the current seasonal shots.The mRNA vaccines are based on a specific part of the influenza protein, called hemagglutinin, teaching the cells to recall it and therefore inducing broad immunity across many influenza strains. In this vaccine, hemagglutinin is the equivalent target the spike protein is in the COVID vaccines.Cancer treatmentsTargeting cancer is another promising avenue for mRNA technology, with mRNA-based cancer immunotherapies already at the trial stage.One technique uses mRNA to mimic “neoantigens” (short bits of tumour proteins on the surface of the tumour cells) identified from an individual patient’s tumour cells. Once delivered to the patient’s immune system, their body should produce powerful killer cells called cytotoxic T cells, eliciting a strong anti-tumour immune response. mRNA technology has a number of possible applications in cancer treatment.Credit: fizkes/Shutterstock Chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T) therapy is a form of cancer immunotherapy currently in use around the world to treat certain forms of leukaemia. It uses immune cells called T cells that are genetically altered in a lab to help them locate and destroy cancer cells more effectively.Traditionally CAR-T therapy has required a patient’s T cells to be harvested from white blood cells, modified, and then injected back into the patient. With mRNA technology the time consuming and most expensive steps are could be eliminated by delivering the CAR gene directly to T cells in the bloodstream.Genetic diseasesmRNA technology is also transforming our response to some genetic diseases. Hereditary angioedema is a rare and potentially fatal genetic disorder where patients suffer severe and repeated attacks of swelling in their organs and tissues.Scientists had discovered that a specific liver gene called KLKB1 prompts these swelling attacks. Researchers developed mRNA as a system to genetically edit and in turn “silence” the offending gene, with initial results positive for patients.A similar trial using mRNA to edit the liver gene transthyretin alleviated symptoms in patients suffering a life-threatening hereditary condition called ATTR amyloidosis which affects the nerves and heart.The path aheadTherapeutics based on mRNA technology are still in their infancy and hurdles remain. For example, mRNA is short-lived in cells and protein is only made for a short time. Increasing the life-span of mRNA in cells would reduce the amount of mRNA required (the dosage). Scientists are working on this and a couple of methods have shown promise.These caveats aside, the ability to deliver genetic information directly into cells could be a new frontier for medical therapeutics.John Fraser, Dean, Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences, University of AucklandThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

Doctors say they are prepared to take on vaccine disinformation. Pregnant women have a higher risk of severe illness from respiratory viruses like the flu and Covid. Nicole Fahey is pictured getting a Covid booster shot in Los Angeles on Nov. 3, 2021. Gary Coronado / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images file Oct. 17, 2023, 9:00 AM UTCBy Erika Edwards and Jane WeaverAs the winter respiratory illness season fast approaches, this is the first year that four vaccines are being recommended during pregnancy. Yet, there are already signs that fewer pregnant women are getting vaccinated — putting themselves and their newborns at increased risk of severe illness or death."We are meeting more resistance than I ever remember," said Dr. Neil Silverman, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist at UCLA Health. "We didn't get this kind of pushback on this scale before the pandemic.""Now all vaccines are lumped together as 'bad,'" he said.In September, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended for the first time that pregnant people get the RSV vaccine to protect against an infection that is usually mild in healthy adults but can be dangerous for children younger than 5. The new guidance means pregnant women will be encouraged to get four vaccines to protect against the flu, Covid and pertussis (also called whooping cough), as well as respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV. However, a recent CDC report found growing doubts about vaccination during pregnancy. Among almost 2,000 women who were pregnant during the height of last year's cold and flu season or when the survey was conducted in March and April, almost a quarter said they were "very hesitant" about getting a flu shot.That is a significant increase over the 17.2% who said they had the same level of reservations during the 2021-2022 respiratory illness season.That reluctance has translated to fewer pregnant women protected against influenza and other illnesses. "Even prior to the pandemic, it was a struggle to get pregnant women vaccinated," said Dr. Denise Jamieson, vice president for medical affairs at the University of Iowa Health Care, as well as a spokesperson for the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Since then, skepticism about vaccines has ballooned and spread to common flu shots that have been given to millions of pregnant women over several decades without any evidence of problematic side effects. Last year, the CDC study found, 47.2% of expectant mothers got their flu shots, down from 57.5% who got their flu shots during the pre-Covid 2019-20 season. Just more than half, or 55.4%, got their Tdap vaccines and only 27.3% of women got the Covid booster before or during pregnancy last season, when omicron infections were filling hospitals. The Tdap vaccine protects newborns against tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis and has been recommended during pregnancy since 2011. "Tdap is just barely recovering from pre-pandemic levels," Jamieson said. "The number of women vaccinated for Covid is disappointing."According to Dr. Linda Eckert, an OB-GYN and global health and immunization expert at the University of Washington, "there's a bias that some patients have, more than they used to, about how they feel about a vaccine." When Eckert recommends a vaccine to her pregnant patients, more now react with, "I'm not going to talk about it," she said. What pregnant women need to know about vaccines Pregnant women are primed to question everything they put in their body, and that's not necessarily a bad thing, experts say. "That instinct is a good one. It's protective mothering," said Dr. Jodie Dionne, associate director of Global Health in the University of Alabama at Birmingham’s Center for Women's Reproductive Health. "We actually want women to question what they're putting in their body.""There are a lot of myths out there, what I would call blatant disinformation that is intended to be more politically charged, not based in science," said Dr. Melissa Simon, an OB-GYN at Northwestern Medicine in Chicago.The only way doctors can address those concerns effectively, Dionne said, is to "create an open atmosphere where they feel comfortable telling you what they're worried about."A key finding in the CDC report is that when obstetricians or providers talked to women about the need for vaccination, they were less hesitant."A lot more people are vaccine hesitant than anti-vaccine," Eckert said. "Vaccine hesitant individuals tend to be curious."Doctors perfected their skills addressing patients' vaccine concerns when Covid shots became "crucial," said Dr. Sarah Pachtman, a maternal/fetal physician at Northwell Health's Katz Women's Hospital of Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New Hyde Park, New York. "We've had so much practice," she said, adding that she's encountered less vaccine hesitancy this year compared to before the pandemic. "I noticed myself spending more time counseling patients," she said. "That helps decrease their hesitancy."Flu and Covid are dangerous during pregnancy During pregnancy, the belly enlarges, pushing up against the diaphragm, decreasing lung capacity. That makes pregnant women — especially those late in their pregnancies — more vulnerable to breathing difficulties, Simon said.Haeli Graham and her son, Colton, during the summer.Courtesy Graham family"When an infection like RSV or Covid or influenza gets into that lung space, it's even harder for people who are pregnant to breathe," she said. Pregnant women are one of the most at-risk groups for flu complications. Covid can also be harmful during pregnancy, and can increase the risk of preterm births and other complications.The virus almost killed Haeli Graham of Swansboro, North Carolina, and caused her son to be born three months early.On July 4, 2021, Graham, then 27 years old and six months pregnant, went to the emergency room, "gasping for air," she said."I couldn't breathe and I couldn't feel my baby moving anymore," she said. A Covid test came back positive. Within days, her lungs collapsed and she developed two pulmonary embolisms. She was intubated and put into a medically induced coma to give her lungs time to heal. Graham had no idea that doctors had to deliver her baby early until she woke up more than a month later. "I was speechless," she said. "It was just shocking that me — a very healthy, active 27-year-old female — could have died."Colton Graham was born three months premature in 2021 when his mother, Haeli, had to be put into a medically induced coma after she contracted Covid.Courtesy Graham familyHer son, Colton, was born at just 3 pounds, 9 ounces. Despite some delays, he is now a healthy 2 year old. Though Covid vaccines were available by summer 2021, Graham's doctor at the time advised her against getting the shot, citing a lack of evidence about their safety. "It was a very scary time," Graham said. "We had no idea what to do."It was not until August 2021, a month after she had been hospitalized with Covid, that the CDC said it had gathered enough evidence to recommend the shots for pregnant people.Vaccinated moms protect their newbornsNow is the time for flu, as well as Covid shots — just ahead of the typical winter respiratory virus season, experts say. Those shots can be given at any stage of pregnancy, according to the CDC. Timing for the two other recommended shots is more specific and should be given during the third trimester. The Tdap vaccine is given between the 27th and 36th weeks of gestation, ideally during the earlier part of that timeline. That timing "helps pass the greatest amount of protective antibodies to your baby before birth," the CDC says on its website. That is especially important when it comes to protecting against whooping cough. Babies are not eligible for the shots themselves until they're several months old. "Babies who catch whooping cough, especially those younger than 3 months old, are most likely to have serious problems, have to be cared for in a hospital, and possibly even die," Tami Skoff, a CDC epidemiologist, wrote in an email. "Vaccinating women during every pregnancy is critical for providing the best protection to the youngest of babies."A CDC study published in February found that the number of babies 2 months and younger who developed whooping cough was significantly lower after the vaccines were recommended. The vaccine is given during each subsequent pregnancy because those antibodies decrease in the mother's body over time.The single-dose RSV shot from Pfizer is recommended between 32 and 36 weeks' gestation. It was found to lower the risk of severe RSV among infants by 91% within the first three months after birth, a time when babies are especially vulnerable. Last winter, a surge of RSV among young children overwhelmed hospitals. Doctors insist there is no danger in vaccinations during pregnancy."We've been vaccinating pregnant people for decades," Silverman said. "While any vaccine for any person, pregnant or not, can have a rare side effect, those serious side effects are exceedingly low. And none of these vaccines have ever been shown to have any negative impact on the fetus or newborn.""Vaccines are a very efficient way to protect mothers and to protect their babies in one fell swoop," he said.

High-risk individuals are eligible now. The flu vaccine will maximize protection against the influenza virus, which is known to cause severe illness and result in hospitalization or even death among previously healthy children, older adults, or pregnant individuals. It is also important to stay up to date with your COVID-19 vaccines. The new XBB- targeting vaccine will help to prevent severe outcomes due to COVID-19. “The region continues to be at high-risk for COVID-19. Influenza is also expected to begin circulating over the coming months. Getting vaccinated is the best way to keep yourself safe from these viruses," said Brian Larkin, Manager, Vaccine Preventable Disease at KFL&A Public Health. "We encourage everyone to make sure they're up to date with their flu and COVID-19 shots. It’s important to use all the tools in our toolbox, like staying home if we're not feeling well, washing our hands often, making sure our vaccinations are up to date, covering our mouth and nose with our elbow when we cough or sneeze, and wearing masks when recovering from illness or when it is right for you and people you interact with. These actions help keep our community safe and healthy.” Given that it takes approximately two weeks post-vaccination to establish immunity against influenza and COVID-19. It is safe and strongly recommended to receive both vaccines at the same time. Both vaccines are accessible at participating primary care offices and pharmacies. For those under two years of age or 65 years of age or older, KFL&A Public Health is offering appointments. Please book online at kflaph.ca/Vaccine or call 613-549-1232. We recommend that all KFL&A area residents, not just the young and the elderly, get immunized when eligible. COVID-19 and flu shots for the general public aged six months and older will be available starting October 30 at participating primary care offices and pharmacies. —30— Subscribe to page updates Subscribe Contact Us Kingston, Frontenac and Lennox & Addington Public Health works together with our communities to promote and protect the public's health.

Forest department official picks a sick crow from a roadside in Jaipur. (File Photo | PTI)Jitendra ChoubeyUpdated on: 16 Oct 2023, 1:41 am2 min readCopiedNEW DELHI: In a bid to eradicate the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) or ‘bird flu’ without the use of vaccinations, India has adopted a set of globally recognised protocols to fight the virus. The country has been successful in the endeavour, with 26 poultry farms made free of HPAI in this manner. Another 10 poultry farms are set to be declared bird flu free as well.The international regulatory agency, World Organisation for Animal Health, has recently approved India’s efforts. “This achievement is a testament to India’s commitment to maintaining high standards related to animal health and biosecurity,” said Parshottam Rupala, Minister of State for Animal Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries. “India, as the third largest producer of eggs (129.60 billion) and the fifth largest producer of poultry meat (4.47 million tonnes) globally, is poised to capitalise on this achievement,” he said.Earlier, the time-consuming nature of the protocol had made way for the illegal vaccination market.The poultry industry had long been demanding preventive measures against avian influenza to protect their millions of birds. The size of the poultry industry stands at 851 million birds in India and they are at a risk of bird flu outbreak. Avian influenza causes devastating consequences for the poultry industry, farmers’ livelihoods, international trade and the health of wild birds.India’s policy to control bird flu is ‘detect and cull’ approach including destruction of animals.Avian flu outbreakBird flu was first detected in India in February 2006, at Navapur town of Maharashtra. Since then, the country has experienced annual outbreaks of HPAI in different regions, leading to substantial economic losses. The disease has been reported in 24 states and Union Territories, resulting in the culling of over 9 million birds to control its spread. The last reported outbreak was also in Navapur in 2021.

COVID-19 / SARS-CoV-2 From 9 to 15 October 2023 (week 41), the number of people testing positive for COVID-19 dropped to 347 cases, compared to 365 cases the previous week (-5%). The positivity rate fell to 23% compared with 25% the previous week. These 2 clinical indicators suggest that a peak in the circulation of SARS-CoV-2 has recently been reached. The viral concentration detected in waste water had been rising in recent weeks [1]. Recent sequencing data showed a preponderance of the EG.5.1 variant (38.7%) [2]. Influenza For the week of 9 to 15 October 2023 (week 41), the number of influenza cases reported by laboratories fell to 1, compared with 5 the previous week. These data largely overlap with LNS sentinel surveillance, which indicates increased circulation of rhinoviruses and SARS-CoV-2, but little circulation of influenza viruses.

For context, always refer to the full article. The Bird flu strain found in Capiz is the same strain that caused an outbreak in Pampanga and Bulacan early in 2022. INFO (1st UPDATE) The Department of Health has recorded 151,375 cases from January 1 to October 13 this year MANILA, Philippines – Influenza-like illness (ILI) cases have increased by 45% compared to the previous year, as reported by the Department of Health (DOH) on Thursday, October 19. Play Video The DOH has recorded a total of 151,375 cases of ILI, also commonly known the flu, from January 1 to October 13 this year. This represents a 45% increase compared to the same period last year. The increase began in September recording a 26% increase in ILI cases compared to previous year. “The higher number of cases in 2023 compared to the previous year is observed in most diseases under surveillance, which could be attributed to the efforts to strengthen surveillance for other diseases as we shift our focus from COVID-19,” the DOH said in its statement released on October 18. The flu season in the Philippines typically coincides with the start of the rainy season, which typically lasts from June to December, the DOH said in a statement. For those who have not yet received the latest flu vaccine strain, before the end of the year is the ideal time to do so since the virus thrives in both cold, dry, and humid, rainy conditions. You can check with your local health office regarding the availability of the vaccine in your area. According to the United States Center for Disease Control, if you feel ill, it’s advised to stay home from school or work and to cover your mouth. Additionally, you should avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth and practice good hygiene habits. – Rappler.com (Editor’s note: An earlier version of this article reported that the 151,375 ILI cases were from October 9 to 13, 2023.

We have had two winters now with H5N1 and a significant number of outbreaks.Gannets during the breeding season on Bass Rock (Danny Lawson/PA)“We are running at a high risk level for infection in our wild birds but low in our kept poultry. It doesn’t mean to say it won’t happen and we continue to encourage all bird keepers to remember biosecurity precautions.”There have been more than 337 cases of bird flu in farmed poultry confirmed across Great Britain since late October 2021.One of the big concerns going into winter will be migratory birds returning from overseas, with Ms Middlemiss saying researchers will be “watching closely” to see what they bring with them.Bird flu outbreaks have had a devastating impact on seabirds, with an outbreak last year on the Farne Islands, off the coast of Northumberland, killing more than 6,000.Ms Middlemiss said the “overarching message” is that while scientists are not seeing the same level of cases as this time last year, “we are still at high risk of infection”.Researchers are concerned about migratory birds returning from overseas (Danny Lawson/PA)Explaining more about the research they have carried out, Professor Brown said their investigations involved collecting blood samples from around 30 northern gannets and 30 shags on Bass Rock, which the Scottish Seabird Centre says is home to around 150,000 gannets during peak season – making it the world’s largest colony.He said it was a “huge logistical challenge” to carry out the research but that they hope to carry out more similar studies.He added: “There was a very high mortality, probably upwards of 50% in some parts of the Rock.“They are in close contact, so when they come together, it is a bit like being inside a poultry house on a poultry farm.“What we did see was individuals that were clearly in contact with birds that had succumbed and died. We did find through blood sampling that we could detect specific antibodies to the H5N1 virus.“It isn’t a simple art to do this because the problem with wild birds, during their lifetime, is that they could be exposed to one or more influenzas and then dissecting the response is not straightforward.“We developed a range of tools that gave us greater confidence that we were truly detecting antibodies to the H5N1 virus.“We were able to show that around 30% of the birds we sampled had antibodies to H5N1, indicating they had been infected and had recovered. In the shags we saw something a bit higher, around 50%.The funding will also help scientists look deeper into how the virus transmits from wild birds to farmed poultry, the gaps in biosecurity that allow the virus to penetrate premises, how this could be addressed and how vaccination might impact outbreaks.While the virus remains low risk to people, another £3.2 million has also been allocated for a sister consortium, focusing on the potential for human transmission.Professor Guy Poppy, interim executive chairman at the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council and UKRI’s tackling infections programme lead, said: “In the face of a relentless challenge, the UK research community, in collaboration with Government, has demonstrated its agility in responding to emerging threats and diseases.“The latest funding for the avian influenza research consortium signifies our collective commitment across research disciplines and Government departments to coordinate a world-class response that helps safeguard animal and human health.“This investment is testament to the UK’s determination to stay ahead of avian influenza and underscores the importance of collaboration in the face of evolving threats.”The research is published at 9am on Friday at science.vla.gov.uk/flu-lab-netSorry, we are not accepting comments on this article.Similar storiesDame Imelda Staunton and Simon Le Bon to receive royal honours at Windsor CastleUK News|Just nowMPs to consider call to remove Church of England bishops from House of LordsUK News|Just nowEnvironmentalists to challenge Rosebank and Jackdaw oil and gas fields in courtUK News|Just nowWhat the papers say – November 12UK News|2 hours agoJohn Smyth QC abuse survivor calls for ‘clean sweep’ of Church of EnglandUK News|2 hours agoMost popular1Big projects at risk as P&R starts mini-BudgetNews|20 hours ago2La Mare site to be ‘transformed’ ahead of Sixth Form Centre moveNews|20 hours ago3‘My Guernsey-born great-uncle deserves the Victoria Cross’News|21 hours agoFollow us onGet involvedSend Us Your NewsSubscribe to the Guernsey PressUseful linksAdvertise with usMaking a complaintGuernsey AirportGuernsey HarboursAbout the websiteAbout usContact usTerms of website usePrivacy PolicyAcceptable Use PolicyHomepageFollow us onTwitterFacebook Back to top© 2024 Guernsey Press.

Agriculture Undersecretary Deogracias Victor B. Savellano told reporters that the vaccines are still undergoing trials. “(They are still under) testing; once approved and we are okay with all the protocols, then we will recommend the vaccines for purchase,” Mr. Savellano added. He said that the DA has received five bird flu vaccines for evaluation. He added that the DA aims to seek approval for testing and use of AI vaccines from the President, who is also the Secretary of Agriculture. “AI vaccines have been around for a long time now but there is no approved protocol for its testing, approval, and use,” Mr. Savellano said. He added that four suppliers have expressed interest in bringing ASF vaccines to the Philippines, with two currently being tested. “They are in various stages of trials at our Veterinary Laboratory Division of the Bureau of Animal Industry,” he said. He added that until the approval of vaccines, the DA is prescribing heightened biosecurity measures to slow the spread of AI and ASF. “For both the AI and ASF vaccines, we want to do it fast, but we want to do it safely also. This is a balancing act, but we are streamlining the process to expedite trials, approvals and eventual use,” he added. The DA has said that it is aiming to increase livestock production by five times by 2028. Separately, Pork Producers Federation of the Philippines Chairman Nicanor M. Briones said in a statement that vaccine testing has only been conducted on starter hogs and not sows and breeders, which are “the ones that produce pigs.” Mr. Briones added that it would take billions more for the hog industry to recover from the effects of the ASF virus. The House of Representatives said earlier that it would re-allocate about P1.5 billion towards ASF vaccines. — Adrian H.

The annual CVO forum is an international gathering where we discuss issues of global importance from animal and public health. See also: EU checks face further delay as Government reveals January launch date It is attended by chief veterinary officers and representatives of all G7 countries alongside the European Commission, the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH), and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). This year's discussion focused on some of the most difficult animal health challenges facing the farming industry today including highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), African swine fever (ASF), and antimicrobial resistance (AMR). See also: Over The Farm Gate Podcast: Avian Influenza - Housing measures lifted but biosecurity remains paramount I know through my conversations with farmers just how devastating outbreaks of avian influenza are for bird keepers and how interested the industry is in the potential to use vaccination to curb this terrible disease. The forum held a good and open discussion around vaccination, and all G7 members have committed to evaluating vaccination as part of a risk assessment. This assessment will consider how vaccination outcomes align with our international objective to protect both poultry and wild populations while maintaining safe international trade. The conversation on avian influenza continued with all G7 members in agreement surveillance systems need to include nationwide and targeted monitoring of wild bird populations and early warning capabilities - which are crucial for a timely response. See also: Government lifts AI prevention zone In the UK, we continue to invest in vaccination research, as well as monitoring vaccine usage in Europe and globally. Any future decisions on the use of vaccination will be risk-based and reliant upon the latest scientific, ornithological, veterinary research and evidence. See also: BSE found on Cornish farm I was also able to present on the AMR approach in the UK and the achievements made so far in the livestock sector. I take immense pride in the fact the UK has already achieved a 55 per cent reduction in antibiotic use in animals since 2014 using a voluntary and collaborative approach between the government, the agriculture industry, and the veterinary profession. See also: Farming figures awarded New Year honours The other major topic for discussion was African swine fever - a disease I know is causing concern for pig keepers as it moves across the continent. The G7 emphasised the importance of raising awareness among veterinarians, importers, and border control officials - as well as acknowledging the value of updated and adaptable contingency plans to effectively manage outbreaks. See also: Practicalities of an Avian Influenza vaccine A key part of my work as a CVO goes into managing our international relationships. Good relations and mutual trust are vital for effective trade. See also: Avian Influenza confirmed What's next? This is important because when do get disease outbreaks, UK farmers can continue to trade and are not impacted by barriers coming down like we have seenover the years with beef in the wake of bovine spongiform encephalopathy. Forums like the G7 are a key part of this work. Success in managing disease, transparency and providing reassurance to trading partners is achieved through coming together as experts to share our knowledge. I now keenly await the comprehensive written reports which detail the outcomes, so my colleagues and I can jointly move forward with tackling these global challenges.

The report shows that outbreaks, previously confined largely to Asia, are now occurring in different regions of the world and affecting larger numbers of poultry. And that poses several threats to humans.Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.TRANSCRIPTThe deadly H5N1 virus, also known as the bird flu, is showing troublesome signs of evolution.A new study, made in conjunction by experts from Australian and Asian universities and published in Springer Nature, reveals new outbreaks of the virus in Europe and Africa.Professor Raina MacIntyre is Head of the Biosecurity Program at the Kirby Institute at the University of New South Wales.She is an expert in influenza and emerging infectious diseases.She says bird flu could be the basis for the next epidemic."It's always been the fear that one day, one of these highly pathogenic avian flu viruses will mutate to become easily transmitted between humans. And there's a lot of red flags around one particular clade, as we call it, of the H5N1 that's been spreading in the last year or two."The first outbreaks in H5 viruses were documented in 2014.Professor Michael Ward is Chair of Veterinary Public Health & Food Safety at The University of Sydney.He explains how the virus has changed over recent years."It rapidly spread across Asia and Europe and Africa and that was thought to be as a result of the virus taken by wild birds that migrate across continents. So it spread quite rapidly and that might've been associated with changes in the virus. And then lately we've seen, in the last 3-4 years, we've seen another change in this virus. We're seeing these ongoing outbreaks that are occurring in particularly northern Europe but also in the US."]]The study goes on to reveal that the H-5 virus has mutated, moving away from Asia where it is said to have originated.A potential outbreak in Australia, while unlikely, could cause significant issues.Professor Ward says other countries affected by the virus faced major problems in their food chains."Trying to control the disease led to a lack of poultry products. A lack of meat and eggs. So, it had that consequence, the supply dried up very quickly because the authorities were trying to control the disease. So, that's the problem. The disease also can be quite devastating when it gets into poultry flocks. It can kill a lot of birds. So you also have that impact as well."So what are the ways that being used to control the disease?Dr David Muscatello is an epidemiology expert with the University of New South Wales.He says there are two ways to stop the bird flu."There are two main methods, as I understand, particularly in domestic animal or agricultural applications: culling the populations of the animals that have been exposed to the virus or potentially exposed to the virus; or vaccinating the birds or the animals against the virus. And vaccination is being used more and more, as I understand it, in the animal populations."But Professor Ward warns the second method carries with it significant risks."The problem with vaccination is, you could potentially make the situation worse if then you're starting to get other viruses mixing with the wild viruses. So, countries have been reluctant to do that."Dr Muscatello explains one of the most troublesome things about the H5 viruses."Influenza viruses are constantly evolving and they evolve very easily. So the viruses are continuously circulating in animal, bird and human populations and they're always evolving. And probably the best evidence of that is that we need to change our human influenza vaccines every year."Bird flu symptoms in humans aren't really all that different from the common flu, as the University of New South Wales' Professor McIntyre explains."It presents with typical, influenza-like illness, so high fever, feeling really unwell, aches and pains, respiratory symptoms like cough and shortness of breath."However, this particular strain of the virus could have some very serious differences in the way it attacks the immune system.Professor McIntyre goes on to explain what makes the H5N1 strain so dangerous."So we see things like seizures, unsteady walking, very prominent neurological symptoms. So it is quite conceivable that if this particular strain, which is called clade 2.3.4.4 b, of H5N1 mutates to infect humans easily, we may see very prominent neurological symptoms, as well as the respiratory symptoms."One way to prevent the possibility of a future pandemic is by keeping a watchful eye on how the virus continues to evolve.Professor McIntyre says her team at UNSW has come up with an innovative way to do that."A way to mitigate that is early warnings and early detection. And we've developed an early warning system at UNSW called "epi-watch" where we actually report on any undiagnosed severe acute respiratory illnesses that are occurring particularly in hotspots of the avian survirus. Because that's exactly how it's going to present. You'll see lots of avian flu virus in animals and birds, and then suddenly you'll start seeing clusters of pneumonia, just like it started in Wuhan in 2020-late 2019."ShareLatest podcast episodesNew program will see pregnant mothers and babies protected from life-threatening virusNew data sheds light on the mental health impacts of losing a pregnancyHysterical: Fatima found a 'hidden community' of grieving parents after not getting culturally safe support'These laws would have protected her': advocates welcome social media banRecommended for you'Embarrassing and disrespectful': Lidia Thorpe faces backlash over King Charles protestindigenous peoplesAustralia's driver's licence rule change — and who it's set to affectaustralian driving licence'Tar balls' identified as debris that closed Sydney beaches.

We should be – it's our country's biggest infectious disease killer, twice as deadly as influenza. Every week we see thousands of cases, hundreds lying in hospital beds, and around 20 deaths. Sorry to say it, but Covid-19 is still alive and kicking. "It's a bit like an unwelcome guest that no one wants to talk about, but it hasn't gone away, that's for sure,'' University of Otago epidemiologist Professor Michael Baker tells The Detail. "It's our number one infectious disease threat... it's really displaced influenza as our biggest single infectious disease killer." And Baker warns the number of reported cases are probably well behind what's actually out there. "[There are] 3,500 or so reported cases every week, but we know that will be at best 50 per cent of the cases in the community... maybe less than that... so we're still looking at about 10,000 cases probably a week at least." Baker says reporting has dropped off for several reasons, such as there no longer being mandatory self-isolation and the Covid-19 leave support scheme ending, which helped pay employees who had to isolate. And wastewater results are showing an interesting, if not slightly concerning, trend. "We're seeing a rise at the moment, a relatively small rise, in the detection of this virus in wastewater, unlike the continuing decline we're seeing in self-reported cases, and this does seem to date to the period when we removed the subsidy for self-isolation, and that coincided with when we removed mandatory self-isolation." Baker says the virus hasn't stopped evolving. He led the publication of a recent paper in the New Zealand Medical Journal, co-authored by 16 academic experts, which calls for careful mitigation strategies. "Mitigation is not a 'do-nothing' approach. You do a selection of things to try and minimise the harms caused by an infection." He talks about being up-to-date with vaccinations, staying at home and self-isolating if you're sick, and putting on masks in crowded indoor environments like public transport. Also in this episode of The Detail, associate professor Helen Petousis-Harris, a vaccinologist at the University of Auckland, talks about vaccine developments. She says current vaccines are effective at protecting against serious disease, but not so much the asymptomatic or mild infections. "They started off with a hiss and roar because they were quite well-matched to those circulating variants," she says. "As that shifted, the ability to prevent initial infection in the first place – that was what you saw wane first, and then the ability to prevent mild disease, whereas you see that protection against more severe disease holding." She says there's a lot of work going on to get better vaccine solutions. "These are things like intranasal vaccines – so vaccines you sniff – or skin patches... you want them in your upper respiratory tract to catch that virus as soon as it appears. So we're likely to see that sort of thing coming along, hopefully near rather than far future now. "And that of course has got that spillover for other respiratory infections as well. Covid's not the only game in town. Influenza causes us grief every year, along with other respiratory viruses." Petousis-Harris says there could be combination vaccines – attacking several viruses in one shot – in coming years. For more news from around New Zealand, go to RNZ.

This achievement is a testament to India's commitment towards maintaining high standards of animal health and biosecurity. Acceptance of Indian Self-Declaration by the WOAH: The Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying, Government of India has self-declared freedom from highly pathogenic avian influenza in 26 poultry areas to the World Organization for Animal Health. On October 13, 2023, on the occasion of World Egg Day, the World Organization for Animal Health approved this self-declaration of India. Avian Influenza in India: Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) is commonly known as bird flu. It was first found in India in February 2006 in Maharashtra. Since then, outbreaks of highly pathogenic and contagious avian influenza have been occurring year after year in different areas of the country. This has caused a lot of economic loss. This disease has been found in 24 states and union territories. This has resulted in the culling of more than 9 million birds to control the spread of avian influenza. Control of Avian Influenza: India's approach to controlling highly pathogenic avian influenza follows the policy of 'detect and kill' outlined in the National Action Plan for Prevention, Control and Containment of Avian Influenza (Revised - 2021). This comprehensive process includes the destruction of infected and destitute animals, eggs, feed, waste and other contaminated materials. It is important to note here that vaccination against highly pathogenic avian influenza is not permitted in India. What is avian influenza? Avian influenza is a highly contagious disease that affects many species of domesticated birds and wild birds, including food-producing birds. This virus, called influenza A or type A virus, is usually found in birds, but can sometimes infect many other mammals, including humans. When it infects humans it is called influenza. Classification: A major control measure: India has adopted a comprehensive approach to reduce the risks associated with highly pathogenic avian influenza by adopting the concept of poultry classification. Classification is an important measure that enhances animal health, reducing the risk of disease spread within and outside the area. It facilitates trade of poultry and poultry related products. Poultry Sector of India: Poultry sector is developed mainly in four states of India, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. This recognition by the World Organization for Animal Health reflects India's commitment to international biosafety standards. It will significantly contribute to enhancing the export potential of Indian poultry and poultry products including meat and eggs. India is the third largest producer of eggs (129.60 billion) and fifth largest producer of poultry meat (4470000 tonnes) globally. The country is now ready to take advantage of this achievement. What benefit will India get from this? India exported poultry and poultry products to 64 countries during the financial year 2022-23. This generated revenue of US$ 134000000. The approval of this self-declaration is expected to create new opportunities for Indian poultry in the global market, which will contribute significantly to the economic growth of the country. The expansion of the Indian poultry sector will increase employment on a large scale, and ultimately boost our economy. World Organization for Animal Health: The headquarters of the World Animal Health Organization is located in Paris (France). The World Organization for Animal Health is an intergovernmental organization responsible for improving the status of animal health around the world. It has been recognized by the World Trade Organization as a reference organization. Till the year 2018, a total of 182 member countries were included in this organization. India is its member.

As of now, 26 poultry farms in the country have declared themselves HPAI-free. In the coming days, more such farms or poultry compartments will be added to the list. Considered as a major achievement in maintaining high standards of animal health and biosecurity, it will facilitate the poultry trade at a faster rate. What is HPAI and the public health challenges?Avian influenza is divided in two categories based on pathogenicity: Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Viruses (HPAIV) and Low Pathogenic Avian Influenza Viruses (LPAIV). HPAIV have strains such as H5N1, H5N8 and H7N9, which are a threat to public health. H5N1 is highly dangerous to both animals and humans. It first broke out in 1959 in Scotland’s poultry and its first human transmission was detected in 1997 in Hong Kong.In India, only one case of H5N1 death of an 11-year-old boy from Gurgaon (Haryana) was registered in 2021. However, officials couldn’t trace how the boy came in contact with H5N1. Also, the boy had co-morbidities. According to the World Health Organization, there were 878 cases of H5N1 infection in humans and 458 (52%) fatalities in 23 countries between 2003 and July 2023.As for LPAIV, it only affects the avian species. It results in lesser mortality but reduces the volume of egg production.Bird flu in IndiaBird flu was first detected in India in Navapur in the Nandurbar district of Maharashtra in February 2006. Ever since, the country has experienced annual outbreaks of HPAI in different regions, leading to substantial economic losses. The disease has been reported in 24 states and Union territories, resulting in the culling of over 9 million birds to control its spread. The last reported outbreak was in Navapur in 2021. HPAI has devastating consequences for the poultry industry, farmers’ livelihood, international trade and the health of wild birds.When there is a bird flu outbreak, the rule of thumb is to cull all poultry—infected or not—to contain the spread of avian influenza. This leads to heavy economic losses for farmers and a long-lasting impact on their livelihoods. Often, bird flu incidents are suppressed by authorities or farmers themselves as they don’t get compensation.Why India isn’t using bird flu vaccine?Many Southeast Asian countries, including China, have developed vaccines and saved their industry. However, India has not adopted vaccination due to its weak surveillance systems. Indian poultry is mostly reared in unorganised farms, including backyard poultry where thousands of farmers are engaged. There is a high risk of monitoring live vaccines as it increases the chances of virus strains from poultry droppings infecting humans. Government officers say despite vaccinations in Southeast Asian countries, there are a high number of human transmission of H5N1 virus.What does self-declaration mean for the poultry industry? It is good news for India’s poultry industry. There are currently 851 million poultry birds in India, making India the third-largest producer of eggs (129.60 billion) and the fifth-largest producer of poultry meat (4.47 million tonnes) globally. India exported to 64 countries last year.Over the last eight years, India has formed two expert committees in the North and South, which consist of state and Central government technical experts chaired by independent experts. They set a methodology and strict protocols for regular testing of workers engaged in the poultry industry and their documentation. After the assessment of documents, the government provides certificates, which are valid for three years. Many countries don’t entertain this certificate but prefer to check samples in their lab to verify the claim. It is a time-consuming process. Since the self-approval system got recognition from the 182- 182-member-nation of WOAH, India’s poultry trade is expected to see record growth. Even with the outbreak of HPAI in other parts of the country, these 26 poultry compartmental-free zones can keep exporting it.Follow The New Indian Express channel on WhatsApp Download the TNIE app to stay with us and follow the latestHealthBird flupoultrydiseaseXploreShow CommentsRelated StoriesNo stories found.

Teresa Montemayor October 18, 2023, 6:52 pm Share Share X (formerly Twitter) Viber Email MANILA – The country has recorded a total of 151,375 cases of influenza-like Illness (ILI) from Jan. 1 to Oct. 13, the Department of Health (DOH) said Wednesday.In a message to reporters, the DOH said the tally translates to 45 percent increase compared to 104,613 ILI cases during the same period last year.The agency also reported that ILI cases have increased by 26 percent in the recent three to four weeks from Sept. 3 to 16 compared to reported cases two weeks prior.“Looking at historical data since 2009, case increases coincide with the onset of rainy and colder months. Hence, we are implementing strict monitoring of cases as we anticipate rise in cases in the coming months,” the DOH said.It added the higher cases this year are observed in most diseases under surveillance, which could be attributed to the strengthened surveillance efforts for the other diseases, as the country shifts its focus from the coronavirus disease 2019.During a Bagong Pilipinas Ngayon briefing on Wednesday, infectious disease expert and Philippine College of Physicians president Rontgene Solante said the reason for the increase of ILI cases are influenza A and influenza B.“Most regions are experiencing this, iyong tinatawag natin na influenza-like illness – ubo, sakit ng katawan (what we call influenza-like illness – cough, body aches), sore throat and some of them may have fever,” he said.“And this is brought about by reasons that medyo malamig na, medyo maraming days na tag-ulan and it’s also the same pattern of increase in the cases as we have last year at expected ito ‘no, for the past several years, talagang ganito ang nangyayari sa atin (it’s already cool, there are many rainy days and it’s also the same pattern of increase in the cases as we have last year and this is expected, for the past several years, this is what’s happening to us).”Solante said increase in ILI cases starts in August until the early part of January.He advised individuals experiencing the symptoms to rest, take necessary medications and not to go to work or school to protect other people from being infected.

The disease is believed to have been recently imported from the South African province of North West. According to the National Director of Livestock Development, Américo Coinceição, cited in Thursday’s issue of the Maputo daily “Notícias”, the Ministry of Agriculture has sent a team to continue investigating the situation in Morrumbene. “All the provinces have been informed to alert the authorities immediately about any symptom of avian influenza or death of animals, especially wild and domestic birds”, Coinceição said. In order to avoid bird flu infections, the National Livestock Development Directorate recommends that producers should only introduce birds into their aviaries after carrying out an inspection or even submitting the animals to a two week period of quarantine. As a result of the bird flu outbreak, all imports of chickens and other poultry products from South Africa have been suspended. This means that the country, especially the cities of Maputo and Matola, is facing a shortage of eggs and chickens. Due to this situation, the vendors are resorting to Eswatini to import eggs and chickens. Avian influenza outbreaks – caused by virus H5N8, H5N1, H5N2 and H7 – have so far been detected in the South African provinces of North West, Western Cape, Mpumalanga, Free State, Kwazulu Natal and Eastern Cape.
