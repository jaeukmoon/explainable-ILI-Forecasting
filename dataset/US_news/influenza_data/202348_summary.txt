- Influenza A virus (IAV) defective interfering particles (DIPs) are being studied as potential antiviral agents.
- Conventional DIPs (cDIPs) contain a deletion in the genome and can only replicate when co-infected with infectious standard virus (STV).
- A new type of IAV DIP called "OP7" has been discovered, which has genomic point mutations and shows higher antiviral efficacy than cDIPs.
- A production system has been developed to produce OP7 chimera DIPs without the need for infectious IAV, addressing safety concerns for medical use.
- The production system involves reconstituting a mixture of cDIPs and OP7 chimera DIPs, with the deleted viral protein expressed by the suspension cell line used for production.
- DIP preparations harvested using this system are not contaminated with infectious virions.
- Intranasal administration of OP7 chimera DIP material has been well tolerated in mice and has shown remarkable antiviral efficacy against IAV infection.
- This new class of broad-spectrum antiviral may contribute to pandemic preparedness.
