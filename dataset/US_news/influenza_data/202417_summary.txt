1. In 2017, a novel H9N2 bat influenza A virus was isolated from an Egyptian fruit bat, which was related to avian A(H9N2) viruses.
2. The virus has features associated with increased risk to humans, but it has not shifted to a preference for α2,6 sialic acid receptors, which are found in human respiratory cells.
3. The virus has a pH inactivation profile and neuraminidase activity similar to human-adapted influenza A viruses.
4. It can readily infect ex-vivo human respiratory cell cultures and replicates in the lungs of female mice.
5. It replicates in the upper respiratory tract of experimentally-infected male ferrets, featuring direct-contact and airborne transmission.
6. These findings suggest that the bat H9N2 virus has the potential for cross-species spill-over and poses an increased risk to humans.
