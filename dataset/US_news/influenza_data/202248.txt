However, there is no way to accurately predict which subtype will cause the next pandemic. Moreover, circulating subtypes of influenza A and B viruses vary each year, and predicting which ones will dominate — for inclusion in seasonal vaccines — is an ongoing challenge.

Watch the recording » What nurses need to know Currently, rates of influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are climbing rapidly across the United States. Pediatric hospitals are full. Hospitalizations for flu are the highest for this time of year in over a decade. This is happening while the Covid-19 pandemic continues. The hospital industry’s normalizing of crisis standards of care sets the stage for the respiratory viral surges to become another crisis. Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) RSV is a respiratory virus that infects the lungs and respiratory tract. In healthy people, symptoms are usually mild and self-limiting. Asymptomatic infections appear to be common and some individuals, including young children, can shed virus for long periods of time. In children and other vulnerable individuals, including many adults, RSV infection can cause serious illness or death. Influenza Influenza is a respiratory virus that infects the nose, throat, and lungs. It can cause mild to severe illness and can lead to death. Asymptomatic infections and presymptomatic transmission are common. Serious complications can happen at any age, but there are some groups at higher risk (adults over age 65 years, children younger than five years, people who are pregnant, and people with certain chronic health conditions). Covid-19/SARS-CoV-2 Covid-19 is the disease caused by the coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, which can infect the respiratory tract. It can cause mild to severe illness and can lead to death. Asymptomatic infections and presymptomatic transmission are common. Serious complications can happen at any age, but there are some groups at higher risk (adults over age 65 years, people who are immunocompromised, and people with certain chronic medical conditions). Anyone infected with SARS-CoV-2 is at risk of long-term health impacts (“long Covid”), which can impact every major organ system, even if their initial infection was mild or asymptomatic. SARS-CoV-2 infections can also lead to immune dysregulation for weeks to months following infection. This is really a Quad-demic… In addition to the three circulating respiratory viruses, a fourth factor is at play in the current crises—hospital disaster capitalism and the health care industry’s embrace of crisis standards of care. The hospital industry has implemented changes motivated by increasing profit and excess revenues and this has set the stage for the current surge in RSV, influenza, and Covid-19 patients needing care and hospitalization to be a crisis. The hospital industry has long implemented programs to increase profits and excess revenues without regard for patient care—such as by intentionally short staffing units, closing units and facilities that aren’t “profitable” enough, and failing to prepare for infectious diseases like seasonal influenza surges and Covid-19. Additionally, for several decades, the hospital industry has desired to replace registered nurses (RNs) entirely. The hospital industry’s aim has been to deskill the nursing process by inappropriately pushing care to the lowest-cost and least-regulated setting, including retail clinics, outpatient surgery centers, and the patient’s home. The attack on nursing practice and patient advocacy includes displacing RNs and RN professional judgment with health information technology, automation, remote monitoring tools and, ultimately, abandoning the patient by leaving complex clinical care to be provided in the home by the family or even by the patient alone. During the Covid-19 pandemic, regulatory flexibility afforded the hospital industry a rationale and opportunity to adopt—and normalize—crisis standards of care, even when not in a surge—from locking up and rationing personal protective equipment (PPE) to adopting harmful staffing models like team nursing. Hospital industry mistreatment and neglect of RNs and other health care workers has also led to many health care workers to leave their respective facilities in order to protect their health, wellbeing, and licenses, which has created a staffing crisis in health care. The hospital industry’s decades-long campaign to increase profits and revenues without regard for patient care has resulted in a decreased number of inpatient beds, especially pediatric beds, and a nation-wide staffing crisis. The result is the current quad-demic surge. How are RSV, influenza, and Covid-19 transmitted? All three circulating respiratory viral illnesses (RSV, influenza, and Covid-19) can be transmitted via contact and airborne/aerosol transmission. Contact Transmission Airborne/aerosol Transmission RSV, influenza, and Covid-19 infection can occur via inoculation through the eye or other mucous membranes from environmental contamination on objects. RSV can survive on surfaces up to six hours and can be recovered from hands for up to 25 minutes.1 Influenza can survive on surfaces up to 12 hours and can be recovered from hands up to five minutes.2 SARS-CoV-2/Covid-19 can survive on surfaces up to 28 days and can be recovered from hands up to nine hours.3 RSV, influenza, and Covid-19 infection can also occur by breathing in infectious airborne particles (or aerosols). Patients infected with RSV, influenza, and SARS-CoV-2/Covid-19 emit infectious particles when they breathe, cough, sneeze, speak, laugh, sing, or have medical procedures performed on their airways. These aerosols can contain infectious virus and can remain airborne and travel up to 27 feet.4 Studies in health care facilities have found airborne RSV, influenza, and SARS-CoV-2/Covid-19.5,6 Studies have documented health care worker exposure to airborne respiratory viruses in their breathing zones while caring for infected patients.7 Immune responses to RSV, Influenza and Covid-19 Being infected with RSV, influenza, or Covid-19 does not guarantee protection from future infection. RSV infection confers only partial immunity and people remain susceptible to repeat RSV infections over the lifespan. There is currently no vaccine for RSV. Immune responses to influenza infection are relatively broad and long-lived, but influenza viruses can escape from immune responses due to their high mutation rates. There are multiple vaccines available for seasonal influenza and the level of protection provided against infection depends on how well the vaccine is formulated to match circulating strains. Typically, seasonal influenza vaccines are 40-60% effective against infection. Seasonal influenza vaccines also provide protection against serious outcomes, such as ICU admission or death from influenza and major cardiovascular events.8,9 SARS-CoV-2/Covid-19 infection confers short-lived immune protection. New variants of SARS-CoV-2 continue to emerge and spread, often with increased immune escape and/or transmissibility. Reinfections are increasingly common. There are multiple vaccines available for SARS-CoV-2/Covid-19 with protection against infection, hospitalization, and death initially strong but then quickly fading over time. Additional boosters have been developed, including most recently the bivalent booster updated to match the Omicron BA.4/5 variants. Boosters have helped restore vaccine effectiveness, but uptake of the bivalent (updated) booster has been low.10 Why is the surge in flu and RSV hospitalizations so bad this year? Public health measures adopted to slow the spread of Covid-19 also helped reduce the spread of other respiratory viruses in 2020. However, those public health measures are no longer in place, so it is not surprising to see a surge in respiratory viral illness transmission. It is likely that immune dysfunction caused by Covid, reinfections, and long Covid is also playing a role in causing the significant impact of RSV on young children and infants and influenza on the general population. At least 75% of children and adolescents have had Covid at least once. Additionally, the closure of pediatric hospitals and units has restricted the number of beds available nationally, contributing to the surge in pediatric hospitalizations.

Workplace protections for nurses and caregivers must be based upon the scientific evidence and the precautionary principle, which states that we do not wait for proof of harm before taking action to protect people’s health. Based on symptoms alone, RSV, influenza, and Covid-19 are not easily distinguishable without a diagnostic test, and the science on transmission is very similar, indicating that they require similar protective measures. Hospitals should cancel non-urgent and elective surgical and other procedures in order to limit transmission of respiratory viral infections and to maintain capacity to respond to the surge in respiratory viral infections. Universal N95 use should be implemented for all staff when in contact with other staff, patients, and/or visitors. Other individuals, such as patients and visitors, should be required to wear a face covering. All patients and visitors should be screened for symptoms of a respiratory viral infection. Patients with symptoms of a respiratory viral infection should be isolated immediately. Diagnostic testing should account for the possibility of coinfections with SARS-CoV-2/Covid-19, influenza, and RSV. Visitors with symptoms or a recent diagnosis of a respiratory viral infection should be restricted from entering the facility. Designated cohort units should be created for patients with suspected/confirmed respiratory viral infections. Patients with different respiratory viral infections should not be placed in the same room. Cohorting of patients should be utilized. A nurse should never have both patients with suspected/confirmed respiratory viral infections and patients without respiratory symptoms/infections. Team nursing should not be utilized. Team nursing transgresses scopes of practices for registered nurses, licensed vocational nurses, and other health care personnel involved. Research clearly shows that team nursing results in poorer patient outcomes than primary nursing as it is prone to lead to role confusion and missed nursing care. Health care workers should be screened for respiratory symptoms prior to each shift and, if symptomatic, provided paid sick leave for missed work hours. Health care workers providing care to patients with suspected or confirmed respiratory viral infections should be provided with optimal personal protective equipment (PPE). Health care workers who perform screening of patients and visitors should also be provided with this PPE. A powered air-purifying respirator, but in no case should a health care worker be provided respiratory protection less protective than an N95 respirator. Eye protection Isolation gown Gloves Health care workers should be provided with prompt notification of exposures to respiratory viral infections. If a health care worker becomes symptomatic or tests positive for a viral respiratory illness following an exposure or possible exposure to an infected or potentially infected patient, coworker, or visitor, they shall be provided paid time off with no impact to their PTO or other benefits. Frequent environmental cleaning using disinfectants and cleaning chemicals that are effective against RSV, influenza, and SARS-CoV-2 in patient rooms and units where infected patients are placed and in common areas of the facility (e.g., lobbies, waiting rooms, stairwells, restrooms).

An experimental mRNA-based vaccine against all 20 known subtypes of influenza virus provided broad protection from otherwise lethal flu strains in initial tests, and thus might serve one day as a general preventative measure against future flu pandemics, according to researchers from the Perelman School of Medicine. Image: Bernard Chantal for Adobe Stock The “multivalent” vaccine, which the researchers describe in a paper published in Science, uses the same messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) technology employed in the Pfizer and Moderna SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. This mRNA technology that enabled those COVID-19 vaccines was pioneered at Penn. Tests in animal models showed that the vaccine dramatically reduced signs of illness and protected from death, even when the animals were exposed to flu strains different from those used in making the vaccine. “The idea here is to have a vaccine that will give people a baseline level of immune memory to diverse flu strains, so that there will be far less disease and death when the next flu pandemic occurs,” says study senior author Scott Hensley, a professor of microbiology at the Perelman School of Medicine. Hensley and his laboratory collaborated in the study with the laboratory of mRNA vaccine pioneer Drew Weissman, the Roberts Family Professor in Vaccine Research and director of Vaccine Research at Penn Medicine. Influenza viruses periodically cause pandemics with enormous death tolls. The best known of these was the 1918-19 “Spanish flu” pandemic, which killed at least tens of millions of people worldwide. Flu viruses can circulate in birds, pigs, and other animals, and pandemics can start when one of these strains jumps to humans and acquires mutations that adapt it better for spreading among humans. Current flu vaccines are merely “seasonal” vaccines that protect against recently circulating strains, but would not be expected to protect against new, pandemic strains.

Nearly 3,000 deaths from influenza have been reported since October.Get more newsLiveonNov. 28, 2022, 11:34 PM UTCBy Erika EdwardsThe floodgates have opened on the flu, with millions of people across the U.S. reporting the illness and nearly 3,000 deaths from influenza since the beginning of October, according to the latest statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.With the start of the holiday season and large family gatherings, cases are expected to keep rising. “We are likely to see an increase in the upcoming weeks,” Lynnette Brammer, an epidemiologist and team lead of CDC’s domestic influenza surveillance team, told NBC News. So far this season, an estimated 6.2 million flu illnesses have been logged, according to the latest CDC data. Twelve of the influenza deaths occurred in children. Of the samples reported to the CDC this season, about 76% are the H3N2 strain of influenza A. The rest are H1N1. Both versions of the flu can result in severe illness.However, most flu patients sick enough to end up in the intensive care unit at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville have tested positive for H1N1, said Dr. Todd Rice, director of VUMC's medical intensive care unit."People don't have a good appreciation for how severe flu can be," said Brammer.Dima Radilla, 92, receives a flu vaccination during a drive-thru clinic in Garden City, Ga., on Nov. 22.Richard Burkhart / Savannah Morning News / USA Today NetworkFlu barreled in unusually early this year, along with Covid and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which has inundated hospital systems. Several years of limited viral activity have resulted in few people with immune systems capable of fighting off the most virulent infectious diseases.“We are dealing with three very contagious respiratory viruses,” said Dr. Ashish Jha, coordinator for the White House Covid-19 Task Force. “Our expectation is we are likely to see an increase in the upcoming weeks," particularly with influenza and Covid. The surge in RSV, however, may have peaked, Jha said. "Nationally, the numbers do seem to be turning down," Jha said. "We'll want to see over the next couple of weeks where that goes. But the preliminary evidence right now is pretty hopeful."Why is this flu season so rough?Typical flu seasons ramp up in December, peaking in January or February, said Dr. Julie Morita, executive vice president of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. With the early start to the flu season this year, many people were infected before they had a chance to get vaccinated, making it easier for the virus to spread.“There was a bigger pool of people who were unvaccinated than there would have been in ordinary seasons,” said Morita, who is also a former public health commissioner for Chicago. "That could be contributing to why we’re seeing such high rates of disease right now.” As of Nov. 28, "influenza-like illness," or ILI, activity — which includes the flu — was highest across the Southeast, as well as in New York City and Washington, D.C.CDCThe latest CDC data on flu activity shows spread “very high” across much of the nation, especially in Arkansas, California, Colorado, Kentucky, Mississippi, New Mexico, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington, as well as New York City and Washington, D.C.There is no evidence that spread of the flu will burn out anytime soon.“It’s a pretty safe bet that flu activity is going to continue on for several more weeks or months,” said Brammer.Intensive care units are already seeing a surge in the sickest patients.“Three weeks ago, we were not seeing much flu in our ICU,” Rice said. “Then the floodgates opened.”Now, 30% to 40% of Rice’s patients in need of the most intensive care have the flu. He blames, in part, the early arrival of influenza. “It resulted in more people at risk because there were fewer people vaccinated.”Follow NBC HEALTH on Twitter & Facebook.Erika EdwardsErika Edwards is a health and medical news writer and reporter for NBC News and "TODAY."AboutContactHelpCareersAd ChoicesPrivacy PolicyYour Privacy ChoicesCA NoticeTerms of Service (Updated JULY 7, 2023)NBC News SitemapClosed CaptioningAdvertiseSelect ShoppingSelect Personal Finance© 2024 NBCUniversal Media, LLCNBC News LogoMSNBC LogoToday LogoThe bird flu outbreak is the deadliest in U.S. history.

A wave of the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian flu has entered Southern California, driven by wild bird migration. Mario Tama/Getty Images The U.S. is enduring an unprecedented poultry health disaster, with a highly contagious bird flu virus triggering the deaths of some 52.7 million animals. The culprit is highly pathogenic avian influenza, or HPAI. It has ravaged farm flocks and chicken yards in 46 states since February, when the first cases were reported in commercial flocks. It's the worst toll on the poultry industry since 2014-2015, when more than 50 million birds died. That earlier outbreak also started in the winter — but while that ordeal was over by the following June, the current outbreak lasted through the summer and has surged anew. Sponsor Message "I'm hopeful that this is not the new normal for us," Richard Webby, director of the World Health Organization's Collaborating Center for Studies on the the Ecology of Influenza in Animals, tells NPR. Some birds have died from the disease itself, but the vast majority are being culled through flock "depopulation," to try to stop the virus from spreading. That includes millions of chickens and turkeys in barns and backyards that had been raised to provide eggs or meat. Here's what you need to know about the 2022 outbreak in the U.S.: 52,695,450 million birds have been wiped out The losses stretch across the U.S., and they're deepest in the country's middle: More than 1 million birds have been killed in each of 11 states that stretch from Utah to the Midwest and on to Delaware, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. In Iowa, two massive egg-laying operations had to cull more than 5 million birds in single incidents earlier this year. Unlike the 2014-15 outbreak, this one is being driven by wild birds, not by farm-to-farm transmission. For commercial and backyard flocks, many early infections centered along the intersection of the Central and Mississippi flyways of migratory wild birds. As those birds traveled, so did the virus. Sponsor Message "We don't know exactly what it is about it, but it does seem just to be able to grow and transmit better in wild birds," Webby, who is also a member of the infectious diseases department at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, tells NPR. "Wild birds are the perfect mechanism to spread a virus because they, of course, fly everywhere," he adds. Influenza viruses are common among wild aquatic birds, which often show no symptoms despite being infected. In January, the dangerous H5N1 flu virus was found in an American wigeon duck in South Carolina — the first U.S. case since 2016, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More reports poured in over the following weeks and months, raising alarms as the virus spread to more states. A highly pathogenic avian influenza virus "can cause disease that affects multiple internal organs with mortality up to 90% to 100% in chickens, often within 48 hours," the CDC notes. "However, ducks can be infected without any signs of illness." A biosecurity sign is seen at the Powers Farm, which raises turkeys in Townsend, Del. The poultry industry has been credited with surveillance and prevention of avian influenza — but the virus remains a threat. Nathan Howard/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Nathan Howard/Getty Images Avian flu poses only a low risk to humans It's very rare for a human to be infected with the avian virus. The first U.S. case of a person infected with avian influenza A (H5N1) virus was reported in April in Colorado. The patient recovered after experiencing a few days of fatigue. The virus does not pose a special risk in the nation's food supply, given proper handling. The CDC states that like any poultry or eggs, heating food to an internal temperature of 165˚F kills any bacteria and viruses present, including HPAI viruses. The virus is like a kid in a candy store "The bird populations haven't seen viruses like this before," Webby says, "so in terms of their immune response, they're all immunologically naïve to this" influenza virus. Sponsor Message "Right now, it's like a kid in a candy store racing around," infecting bird populations, he says. U.S. experts had been bracing for an outbreak, watching successful strains of the H5N1 influenza virus proliferate in Europe and elsewhere. Now that the virus is here, it shows no sign of going away. A key part of the challenge, Webby says, is that like the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the avian flu virus has spun off several variants of concern. And right now, a specific version of the virus — known as clade 2.3.4.4b — is ruling the roost. "You can think of that like an omicron variant" because of its wide prevalence, Webby says. Animals Zoos across North America are moving birds indoors to protect them from avian flu Viruses are notoriously quick to mutate. And since its arrival in North America, the avian influenza virus has continued to change. "When the virus came over into the Americas, it started to interact with the viruses that we have in our wild birds here," picking up different combinations of other genes, Webby says. Comparing the current U.S. virus to the one in Europe, Webby says, "From the outside looking in, they look very similar. But when you actually go on the inside and take a look, the viruses we have here are quite different now from what was in Europe." It's possible that wild bird populations will build up an immunity to the virus — but Webby warns that it will take months to understand whether that is happening at a meaningful level. The outbreak hasn't raised all poultry costs If you like to eat chicken, you're in luck. This version of the influenza virus doesn't affect "broilers" — chickens raised for meat — as badly it does "layers" — table-egg laying hens — and turkeys. "For whatever reason, turkeys and layer birds tend to be more susceptible" to the virus, says Amy Hagerman, an assistant professor at Oklahoma State University who specializes in agricultural economics. Sponsor Message "The chicken that most people think of, their chicken tenders, their chicken sandwiches, all of those things haven't tended to have the same kinds of impact," she adds. Hagerman warns that in a time of inflationary pressure and supply-chain snags, it can be hard to directly link a price hike to the virus. But she notes that U.S. egg prices can be affected if just a few farms have to dispose of their flocks. Egg prices have risen this year, as aggressive measures against avian influenza disrupted the U.S. industry. Here, eggs sit on a supermarket shelf in San Mateo County, Calif. Liu Guanguan/China News Service via Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Liu Guanguan/China News Service via Getty Images "Generally speaking, these complexes are over a million birds, easily," Hagerman says. "It takes fewer egg-laying operations being affected by HPAI to drive up the price of eggs and egg products," she adds, especially since the majority of U.S. production goes to the domestic market. The virus has hit many turkey farms — but because those operations tend to be smaller and the cases have been spread out over time and space, producers have mostly been able to absorb the losses, building up stocks of frozen turkey ahead of the end-of-year holidays. "So, yes, we certainly saw an increase in turkey prices in this holiday season," Hagerman says, "but not as much as we might have anticipated given the extent of this outbreak." What about vaccines? The presence of the virus in the commercial food chain raises a number of possible trade headaches — but so would using a vaccine to fight it. "A lot of countries don't use vaccines for this virus in their poultry," Webby says. "One of the big complications is timing on a vaccine," Hagerman says. "Generally you need two doses of a vaccine and then a length of time to achieve full effectiveness." "If you have a bird that has a very short feeding window before it's ready for harvest, that can be a lot more challenging because you also need to allow the withdrawal period after the vaccine before the bird is harvested," she adds. Sponsor Message Another central issue is the difficulty of surveillance — of knowing whether a bird is infected with a deadly influenza virus but isn't showing symptoms because they've been vaccinated. National Bird flu outbreak drives Nebraska to cull 1.8 million more chickens But the calculations might change if the virus is determined to be endemic in wild birds or in a geographic area. That "certainly seems to be the case in Europe and Africa," Webby says, adding, "my gut feeling is we're headed that way in the Americas as well." "These are actually discussions that are going on now," Webby says, describing ideas such as what kind of post-vaccination surveillance would be needed to "make sure your trading partners are happy that the virus is not circulating silently." The last outbreak didn't survive the summer. This one did Experts say poultry farms should be credited with limiting the virus as much as they have, hailing the success of surveillance and biosecurity programs. But nearly 11 months after the first known wild case in the current outbreak, the deadly influenza virus is still here. "Generally, when the weather gets hot, influenza goes away for the most part," Hagerman says. That was the case in the 2014-2015 outbreak — which came when Hagerman worked at the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, or APHIS. Animals Bald eagles around the U.S. are contracting the bird flu "Bright sunshine and heat kills the virus in the environment," Hagerman says, describing how summer weather helped end the earlier outbreak. "This time we didn't see that virus circulation going down to zero in our wild bird population" over the summer, Hagerman says. Instead, the virus sort of simmered through the summer months, she adds, "and then we get into the cooler, wetter months of the fall and we see a resurgence." The long outbreak is discouraging, Hagerman says: "If we look at Europe, we can see that they are on two years of HPAI outbreaks."

"It's been something we've been monitoring for two decades now and it creates a real problem, not only for wildlife but it can have dramatic impacts on domestic stock."He added, "Because this virus is so contagious, drastic measures have to be put into place to stop the spread and that ultimately results in the death of millions of birds."Can people be infected with avian flu?Avian flu viruses do not usually infect people but there have been rare cases.Because the virus is shed through mucus, saliva and feces, most infections occur when a human comes into contact with these fluids or inhales them.MORE: Flu cases, hospitalizations, deaths continue to surge across USSymptoms can range anywhere from mild to severe and, sometimes, result in death, according to the CDC."We have to remind people the risk to humans is low, but at the same time, unprotected contact with birds that look sick can pose a risk," Brownstein said. "An additional layer is when you have this much virus spread, there's opportunities for mutation and this is where there's an opportunity for a version of this virus that could actually have deeper impact in the human population as well."He said there is no evidence to suggest people can contract bird flu from eating poultry meat or poultry products, such as eggs.Why is there an outbreak?It's believed that the outbreak began from wild birds. In January, the United States Department of Agriculture announced a highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza was found in wild birds for the first time since 2016, mainly in North Carolina and South Carolina.The birds then migrated, spreading the virus to farms, with the first outbreak confirmed Feb. 9 at a turkey farm in Dubois County, Indiana.Cage-free chickens are shown inside a facility in Lakeside, California, April 19, 2022.Mike Blake/Reuters, FILESince then, birds across 46 states have either died as a result of infection or been killed due to exposure of infected birds, according to the USDA.By comparison, the 2015 outbreak only affected birds in 21 states.What should people do?The CDC recommends that people should avoid contact with wild birds whenever possible, especially because they can be infected with avian flu and not appear ill.In addition, those who work directly with birds such as in zoos, in wildlife conservations centers at meatpacking plants or on farms -- or those who have backyard poultry -- should use protection.MORE: Flu cases continue to rage across the US while vaccination rates lag"Right now you want to use protective equipment, like gloves and N-95 masks," Brownstein said. "Just like any virus, you want to avoid touching your mouth, nose, your eyes after contact with birds. It's important changing clothes if you've had any contact."He also recommended that people receive their flu vaccine as soon as possible."It won't prevent infection from bird flu but can reduce the risk of getting sick," Brownstein said.Popular ReadsTrump's plan for education in his second term3 hours agoSotomayor has no plans to resign: SourcesNov 10, 4:27 PMArrest in fatal shooting at Tuskegee UniversityNov 10, 6:35 PMMissing American tourist in Hungary killed: PoliceNov 9, 1:36 PM538's final forecasts for the 2024 electionNov 5, 7:49 AMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkAbout Nielsen MeasurementChildren's Online Privacy PolicyContact UsDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationInterest-Based AdsPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseYour US State Privacy Rights © 2024 ABC NewsCalifornia reporting very high flu levels, among worst in U.S. - Los Angeles Times News Home Page California Election 2024 Housing & Homelessness Politics Science & Medicine World & Nation Business Artificial Intelligence Autos Jobs, Labor & Workplace Real Estate Technology and the Internet California California Politics Earthquakes Education Housing & Homelessness L.A.

(U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) By Rong-Gong Lin IIStaff Writer Dec. 3, 2022 Updated 12:14 PM PT Share Share via Close extra sharing options Email Facebook X LinkedIn Threads Reddit WhatsApp Copy Link URLCopied! Print California is now reporting very high flu levels, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as the respiratory illness continues to surge nationwide.The CDC uses five overall levels, from minimal to very high, to measure influenza-like illnesses across the U.S. and its territories. On Friday, the agency’s color-coded map showed California and 10 other states, along with New York City, shaded purple, the worst of the three shades in the very high flu level.Since the start of October, CDC officials estimate, there have been 78,000 flu hospitalizations and 4,500 deaths nationally. Advertisement The California Department of Public Health classifies all of Southern California as having high flu levels, while Central and Northern California are rated moderate. Flu is the reason for nearly 4% of hospitalizations each week at Kaiser’s Northern California facilities, the highest in any of the prior four flu seasons. In Los Angeles County, flu and COVID-19 cases are surging, and RSV — or respiratory syncytial virus — also remains at a high level. California Flu could be far worse in L.A. this season. Here’s why Influenza has been largely dormant the past two seasons, possibly due to the infection-prevention protocols put in place to ward off the coronavirus. Oct. 5, 2022 “This triple threat … has a lot of potential to cause there to be significant circulating illness and to strain our healthcare system — both in terms of the number of beds that are available and the number of healthcare workers that are impacted by illness, which lowers the hospital’s capacity to take care of patients,” L.A. County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said in a recent briefing. Advertisement The flu positivity rate in L.A. County has reached 25%, a level not seen at this time of year in the last four years. “Clearly, we’re ... off the charts,” Ferrer said. “We already are seeing many individuals hospitalized for flu-related illness and complications. So please, we urge people to not just think of this as ‘just the flu.’ It’s not too late to get your seasonal flu shot,” she added. California has recorded at least 36 flu-related deaths since the start of October, based on death certificate data. That figure is probably an undercount. Advertisement The positivity rate for RSV also remains elevated — around 15%, higher than in any of the four prior cold-and-flu years, which run October through September. There are some indications that RSV activity may have peaked in L.A. County in early November and is starting to decline. In late October, the positivity rate exceeded 20%, according to county data. But it’s possible the 15% rate is simply a result of more people being tested for the virus, Ferrer said. “The current percent positivity, even while it’s dropped, still surpasses the highest percent positivity values seen for our last five seasons,” Ferrer said. “So, still an alarming number of people who are testing positive for RSV.” At Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, the RSV positivity rate is 23%. That’s dropped considerably from Nov. 1, when the rate was 38%. But the latest figure is still quite high and is about the same as during the peak for all of last winter, which was 24%. The emergency room at CHLA is so busy that it cannot always accommodate patient transfers from other hospitals. Advertisement The positivity rate for flu at CHLA is 19%; before Thanksgiving, it was 12%.Orange County’s RSV situation remains the same as it was the prior week, according to its Health Care Agency, where officials declared a public health emergency over RSV and other viral illnesses stressing children’s hospitals. Increasing coronavirus-positive hospitalizations are exacerbating the RSV situation, as a rise in COVID-19 hospital patients means there’s fewer hospital beds available, the agency said. At Kaiser’s Northern California hospitals, about 2.2% of hospital admissions are related to RSV, down from 2.3% last week, according to the most recent available data. Those rates are higher than in the five preceding cold-and-flu seasons.There have been at least 14 RSV-related deaths, according to California death certificate data, since the start of October. The figure is probably an undercount. “Given the high levels of RSV activity, caution is warranted,” Ferrer said. “RSV often impacts young children most severely and causes bronchiolitis [inflammation of the airways] and pneumonia. It’s important to take precautions to prevent respiratory illnesses. This includes washing your hands often, and for RSV in particular, wiping down frequently touched surfaces.” California Stop touching your face! It could help you stay healthy this holiday Looking for an easy way to reduce your risk of catching a viral illness? Try to stop touching your face.Nov. 24, 2022 In addition to wearing a mask, health experts say one of the easiest ways to reduce your risk of catching the flu or other viral illnesses is to avoid touching your face. Advertisement The CDC notes that people can be infected with flu and RSV by touching contaminated surfaces, where some viruses can survive for days, and then their face.“The one point I want to reemphasize is … avoiding touching your eyes, nose and mouth,” Dr. Ralph Gonzales, a UC San Francisco associate dean, said at a recent campus town hall. “Very good studies have shown that if we can double down our efforts to be vigilant about this, that will increase our chances of staying flu-free.”Still, this simple-sounding advice may be easier said than done. Touching your face can be a spontaneous or even subconscious act that some research indicates can help us deal with anxiety and discomfort, or be related to negative or dissatisfactory feelings.And it’s something that happens a lot. A study from 2015 caught medical students in class touching their faces 23 times per hour on average.Here are some tips on how to train yourself to avoid touching your face.Be mindful when you do touch your face, and catch yourself when — and, preferably, before — you do it.If you catch yourself before touching your face, consider folding your hands or doing something else with them.Got an itch? Try to ignore it. If that’s bothersome, wash your hands, then scratch it, then wash your hands again. Or buy sterile wooden tongue depressors to use as a tool to scratch itches.Regular hand-washing is also an important step to help thwart viral spread, officials say. When soap and water aren’t available, hand sanitizer can be used as a substitute. More to Read Early signs California’s COVID surge is peaking: ‘It’s not gone away.

And so should your plan to get your flu shot. The shot, also known as the influenza vaccine, is a vaccine that protects against the influenza viruses. All flu vaccines in the United States are "quadrivalent" vaccines, which means they protect against four different flu viruses: an influenza A(H1N1) virus, an influenza A(H3N2) virus, and two influenza B viruses. Most flu vaccines are given with a needle, usually in the arm, but there also is a nasal spray flu vaccine. Most importantly, the flu vaccine is the best way to reduce your odds of spending time in flu agony. annebaek / Getty Images Why You Should Get the Flu Shot The flu may be common but is a potentially serious disease. In some people, it can lead to hospitalization and sometimes even death. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that, annually between 2010 and 2020, the flu has caused: 9 million–41 million illnesses 140,000–710,000 hospitalizations 12,000–52,000 deaths But it's important to remember that each flu season is different, and flu can affect people differently during different flu seasons. For example, during the 2021-2022 influenza season, due to COVID-19 restrictions including social distancing and masking, the CDC estimated that influenza was associated with 9 million illnesses, 4 million medical visits, 100,000 hospitalizations, and 5,000 deaths. Also, if you're wondering if you really need the flu vaccine, the answer is 100% yes. The CDC recommends that everyone six months and older get vaccinated every year. "We always encourage everybody to get vaccinated as soon as possible," said Jean Moorjani, MD, a pediatrician at Orlando Health Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children. Vaccination to prevent flu and its potentially serious complications is particularly important for people who are at a higher risk of developing serious flu complications. If you are 65 or over, or have certain health factors such as chronic lung disease, asthma, and kidney disease, you are at an increased risk of developing serious complications from flu. How Long Before the Vaccine Works To keep yourself safe during the flu season, it's best to get your vaccine as soon as you can each fall. But there is one thing the flu vaccine can't do: safeguard you from the flu immediately. In fact, the vaccine needs some time to work its magic. "It takes about two weeks after getting the vaccine for your body to build up enough antibodies to protect against the flu," said Dr. Moorjani. That means the flu could still creep up on you during that two-week waiting period. Since you need to give your body two weeks to build up those flu antibodies, it's crucial you get your vaccine before the end of October, said Dr. Moorjani. No one wants to enter the thick of flu season, which ramps up in November and December, without proper protection. Other Precautions Because of the two-week build-up period, it's important to take other flu-preventing precautions. You still need to get enough sleep, maintain a healthy diet, and stick to your workout schedule to keep your immune system in fighting shape in case you do encounter the flu virus. And of course, wash your hands with soap and water (or use hand sanitizer if you can't find a sink) regularly—especially before you eat or touch your eyes, nose, or mouth, all of which are conduits that allow flu viral particles to enter your body and infect you. Even after the two-week wait, never slack on these anti-flu measures. How Effective the Flu Shot Is Flu vaccine effectiveness can vary from season to season. The variation depends in part on the age and health status of the person getting the vaccine and the similarity or "match" between the viruses in the vaccine and those in circulation. During seasons when flu vaccine viruses are similar to circulating flu viruses, the flu vaccine has been shown to reduce the risk of flu illness by 40% to 60%. A Quick Review So, to stay healthy during flu season, don't delay getting your flu vaccine. It can up to two weeks for the flu vaccine to be effective so be sure to get it before the peak of flu season and, in the two weeks after receiving your vaccine, be sure to wash your hands often, eat a well-balanced diet, and exercise to stay healthy.

However, co-administration has a possible pitfall that pharmacists need to be aware of.The CDC strongly recommends adults aged 50 years and older get 2 doses of recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) (Shingrix), in addition to immunocompromised adults aged 19 years and older.1 They note that this vaccine, which is more than 90% effective, is the only way to prevent shingles and accompanying postherpetic neuralgia.1The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) says co-administration is safe and recommended, and advises that both recombinant and adjuvanted shingles vaccines can be given with the flu shot, in different arms.2 “Concomitant administration of RZV with Fluarix Quadrivalent (influenza vaccine) (QIV) has been studied, and there was no evidence for interference in the immune response to either vaccine or safety concerns,” ACIP reports.2There is a catch, revealed by a study by Benjamin M Rome, MD, MPH, of the division of pharmacoepidemiology and pharmacoeconomics in the department of medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and of Harvard Medical School, in Boston, Massachusetts, and colleagues. The researchers reported that less than 50% of adults get the flu shot, and side effects play a major factor in patients avoiding vaccinations. Between August 1, 2018, and March 31, 2019, Rome and colleagues studied a cohort of 89,237 patients aged 50 years and older who either received the shingles and flu shot at the same time or separately for the 2018-2019 flu season. Women made up 58.3% of the group; 85.7% had at least 1 comorbidity; and 70.1% were white. They then tracked the number of flu vaccinations for the following flu season and found “uptake in 2019-2020 was lower among 27,161 individuals who received concurrent influenza and zoster vaccines compared with the 62,076 individuals who received the vaccines on separate days (87.3% vs 91.3%; adjusted odds ratio, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.71-0.78; P < .001). Results were similar across subgroups.”3Brigid Groves PharmD, MS, senior director of practice and professional affairs at the American Pharmacists Association (APhA) in Washington, DC, spoke with Drug Topics® on the reduction of flu vaccination the year following the co-administration of shingles and flu shots. Pharmacists can prevent the drop-off in flu vaccine uptake the following year by counseling patients on expected side effects from each type of vaccine before administering shots, Groves said. “Flu vaccines reactions are typically localized to the injection site and consist of pain, redness, or swelling. Shingles vaccine reactions can be more systemic in nature, including fatigue, headache, or muscle aches,” she noted.Groves advised clarifying these side effects with patients. “Explain that the shingles vaccine is known to have a greater likelihood of systemic reaction, which is less likely to happen with a flu shot. The patient may notice a greater reaction when getting both together. Emphasize that it is safe and recommended to get the flu and shingles vaccines together.” Groves added that if a patient prefers it, pharmacists may consider administering the flu and shingles vaccines on separate visits to accurately relate reaction, if any, to the specific vaccine.“Consider giving the flu shot in the patient’s left arm (using L alliteration) and the shingles vaccine in the right arm to separate location and easily remember which side,” Groves advised. “Deliver a strong recommendation and endorsement for getting an annual flu shot,” she said.References1.

(Photo by Ed Konrad) COVID-19 isn’t the only contagious disease sweeping across American shores. Earlier this year, the team at the Southeastern Cooperative Wildlife Disease Study (SCWDS) in UGA’s College of Veterinary Medicine confirmed the first cases of a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus in three bald eagles in Georgia. The news set off alarm bells in the Georgia wildlife community. “It’s an unprecedented outbreak,” said Nicole Nemeth, associate professor in the College of Veterinary Medicine and head of the wildlife research and diagnostic service at SCWDS. “Sometimes influenza virus comes in with migrating birds and then dissipates. This outbreak is making us nervous.” Often referred to as HPAI, the virus has killed thousands of wild birds in more than 50 countries and shows no signs of stopping. Birds of prey have been hit hard, with HPAI a likely factor in decreased nesting success among Georgia’s coastal bald eagles. Domestic poultry have been affected, too, with millions of chickens across the United States depopulated to curtail the virus’s spread. HPAI has also been detected in foxes, skunks, marine mammals, and bears. It’s an unsettling scenario, even for experts accustomed to receiving and delivering grim news. Former SCWDS director David Stallknecht says the program serves a vital epidemiological role for the health of both animals and humans, since many pathogens they monitor can jump from species to species. “I’m worried,” said David Stallknecht, professor in the College of Veterinary Medicine and former director of SCWDS. “These viruses find their way into naïve populations in a manner similar to how COVID entered the human population, and that doesn’t go well. We don’t yet know if there will be long-term impacts on wildlife populations.” While the deaths of nesting eagles might prompt some to look the other way, the SCWDS team has kept vigil, helping state agencies and wildlife groups understand how the virus is changing and evolving. That’s their job—and the passion that drives them. “Our ability to help is by learning as much as we can,” said Rebecca Poulson, assistant research scientist with SCWDS. Disease detection for 65 years and counting SCWDS has been in the forefront of disease detection and surveillance since 1957, when it was founded by the Southeastern Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies to determine why white-tailed deer were dying in large numbers. SCWDS’s first scientists successfully identified a hemorrhagic viral disease as the cause of that die-off. They forged an agreement with UGA’s College of Veterinary Medicine to establish a headquarters in Athens, and research expanded to include wildlife species across the southeastern United States. Monitoring avian disease is a large part of SCWDS’ mission. Here research professional Deb Carter carefully places a snow goose into a crate for transport. After sampling, the bird will be released. (Photo by Diane Borden-Billot, U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service) Today a partnership of 17 member states and led by 8 core faculty members, SCWDS is tasked with investigating wildlife diseases and providing expertise to federal and state agencies on wildlife health, domestic livestock interests, and human health. SCWDS experts lead with diagnostics and surveillance while simultaneously raising public awareness. Their message? Animal, human, and environmental health are inseparable—and individual actions on behalf of wildlife matter more than we might think. “Everyone is a steward,” said Mark Ruder, associate professor in the Department of Population Health and the director of SCWDS. “Some people just don’t know it yet.” In the news, behind the scenes Diagnosing HPAI in bald eagles wasn’t the first time the team’s findings have made headlines. In recent years SCWDS researchers have received attention for their engagement on a range of cases: mysteriously dead crows, deer with hairy eyeballs, and rabid black bears, to name just a few. Some of these are rare events, curiosities that attract temporary interest and then fade from view. Other times, cases don’t garner as many headlines yet pose a greater threat to ecosystem health in the long run. Take influenza A viruses in migrating waterfowl and shorebirds. Poulson has been studying the pathways of these common viruses in waterfowl and shorebirds throughout North America. While scientists have long known about low-pathogenic flu viruses, Poulson’s investigations revealed that they can survive outside their hosts and stay infectious far longer than once estimated—up to seven months. “We’re looking at how these viruses move with wild birds as they migrate,” she said. “Shorebirds are especially concerning because of their conservation status. We need to learn more.” A group of shorebirds are foraging on horseshoe crab eggs at a stopover site in South Carolina as they prepare for long-distance migration to the Arctic. The ruddy turnstone, seen here with orange legs, plays an important role in the movement of influenza A viruses. (Photo by Deb Carter) Behind the scenes, SCWDS is also tracking chronic wasting disease (CWD) in cervids, a fatal neurological condition affecting white-tailed deer and other deer species. Like mad cow disease, the illness is spread by pathogenic proteins that can cause symptoms mimicking dementia. Although CWD has occurred in the United States since the 1960s, the disease’s spread is causing concern. With Alabama, Tennessee, and North Carolina all seeing recent cases, Georgia wildlife experts are bracing themselves. SCWDS is tracking transmission pathways, supporting Georgia’s Department of Natural Resources and other first responders as they try to prevent the disease from crossing into the state. “We really lean on public engagement here,” said Ruder. “We rely on the public to see and report sick deer.” Private citizens should call their state wildlife agency to report sick or dying wildlife for submission to SCWDS. From service to research and back again Research forms an integral part of SCWDS’s mission, and the support activities the team carries out in the field both shape and are shaped by individual faculty interests. Nemeth’s scholarship offers one example. Her work explores the potential role of disease in the decline in wild turkeys across the Southeast. These turkeys, once game staples, have experienced marked population decreases over the past 10 to 20 years. Along with other faculty at SCWDS, Nemeth has assessed the susceptibility of wild turkeys to West Nile virus infection and studied lymphoproliferative disease virus (LPDV) as another potential contributor to the birds’ decline. LPDV is a tumor-causing virus first documented by SCWDS in 2009. Recent grants from the National Wild Turkey Federation and the Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies’ multistate conservation grant program will allow Nemeth, several other SCWDS faculty members, and Warnell faculty member Michael Chamberlain to further examine LPDV and other diseases of wild turkeys. This black bear suffers from sarcoptic mange, a disease that affects numerous species of wildlife and also domestic dogs. The disease causes animals to develop severe skin problems and hair loss and can ultimately lead to death. (Photo courtesy of Jennifer Ballard, Arkansas Game and Fish Commission) “We need to answer these questions to conserve turkeys as an important gamebird,” Nemeth said. “We need more information at the cellular level to understand the potential impacts of disease.” Michael Yabsley’s research interests include sarcoptic mange in black bears. Though the “itch mite” has been detected in bears, foxes, and coyotes for 20 years, recently the disease has worsened, explained Yabsley, professor of wildlife disease and a diagnostic parasitologist for SCWDS. Mange is now affecting bear populations in more states, including the first case found in Georgia last year. “These bears look really bad,” he said. “They’re naked and skinny and suffering. It’s caused significant public outcry. People are demanding action, but state agencies don’t always have a lot of options.” Yabsley and UGA colleagues are working to understand why the mange is becoming so severe. They are also conducting a study of human emotions surrounding mange and wildlife, partnering with faculty in the Warnell School of Forestry and Natural Resources to examine the human dimensions of conservation efforts. Chris Cleveland, assistant professor in the College of Veterinary Medicine and a SCWDS scientist, began his research career studying the resurgence of guinea worm in domestic dogs. He worked with Yabsley and experts at The Carter Center to study the parasite’s transmission in Chad and subsequently developed clinical field trials for dogs infected with the parasite, including a pharmacokinetic study of a novel treatment for dogs. Michael Yabsley, a SCWDS researcher and faculty member in both veterinary medicine and forestry, studies tick-borne disease in both wildlife and humans. Most recently, he’s monitored the spread of the Asian longhorned tick, which has been associated with numerous human and animal diseases. (Photo courtesy of Michael Yabsley) More recently, support from the USDA is allowing Yabsley, Cleveland, and Ruder to study the Asian longhorn tick, first recognized in New Jersey in 2017. They have conducted surveillance to assess the importance of wildlife hosts, habitats, and microclimate variables on the tick’s presence and abundance in a Virginia county. In an era of climate change, time is of the essence to understand what kind of threat this tick poses for humans. The number of pathogens carried by this tick is increasing annually. “A single tick can churn out a whole new population,” said Ruder. “When you think about invasive species, that’s about as good—or as bad—as it gets: you only need one.” Training for change Mentoring and equipping the next generation comprises a key part of these research efforts. SCWDS faculty offer educational workshops and programs for wildlife biologists and veterinarians; they also train diagnosticians, graduate students, and pathology residents. Students have the chance to engage in hands-on field work at every step of the research. Cleveland, for example, works with his students on regional surveillance for a zoonotic tapeworm (Echinococcus) found in coyotes and other wild canids. “Being out in the field, experiencing different perspectives, it’s so important for learning,” he said. “Whether you’re talking to local hunters, state biologists, or even a tribal chief in Chad, all those conversations should inform how we frame our research questions.” Sonia Hernandez, professor of wildlife disease in a shared position between SCWDS and the Warnell School of Forestry and Natural Resources, brings students into her studies of how anthropogenic activities affect wildlife ecology and health. Since 2009, she has studied the American white ibis and its adaptation to urban life. Florida has destroyed about half of its natural wetlands, and ibises are attracted to cities because people feed them. Hernandez and her students explore how foraging and living in the city changes these birds’ movement patterns and health, with a particular focus on Salmonella. They have found that ibises in cities have more Salmonella than those in natural areas. They were also the first to describe that West Nile virus can kill white ibis nestlings, a link that had not been known until she and team members conducted a key study. “There are so many changes that we humans are imposing on the environment—and those changes come with important impacts on pathogen and disease dynamics,” Hernandez said. “It’s a wonderful time for someone who wants to try to disentangle some of these effects —with evidence-based research—hopefully to make some sound management recommendations that will keep wildlife and people healthy.” “Everyone is a steward [of wildlife health]. Some people just don’t know it yet.” –Mark Ruder, associate professor of population health in the College of Veterinary Medicine and director of the Southeastern Cooperative Wildlife Disease Study, leaning into the cooperative nature of the project’s mission. Realism and hope It takes a special type of person to enter and embrace a career in wildlife disease research. “We have faculty and staff who have been here a long time,” said Poulson. “They’ve devoted their lives to this work. Some days are hard, but we can lean into the support of the team. We’re small but mighty!” Nemeth chose the field because she loves wildlife and saw the need to contribute to their conservation. One of her recent studies tracks the pathways of anticoagulant rodenticides—rat poison—in bald and golden eagles, information critical to informing regulations surrounding exposure risk. A bird who eats a poisoned rat can also experience fatal poisoning, she explained. “As long as I can see wildlife out there fighting to live, I’ll keep fighting for them,” she said. “That gives me hope. They’re still out there. They’re trying to adapt to our changing world.” Engaging in research that daily confronts the realities facing imperiled wildlife isn’t easy. But doom and gloom is not how the SCWDS team tells this story. “I do this work because it’s incredibly interesting,” Stallknecht said. “Wildlife health is all related to our individual actions, one way or another. There are steps we can take. Tiny steps add up.” He gave an example: “When I build a house, I destroy wildlife habitat. What should I do? Maybe build a smaller house. Stop and think about our collective impact and our individual impact. Ask yourself: What difference am I going to make?” Associate professor Nicole Nemeth, who heads up SCWDS’ wildlife research and diagnostic service, feels a responsibility to pursue the program’s mission. “As long as I can see wildlife out there fighting to live, I’ll keep fighting for them,” she says. “They’re trying to adapt to our changing world.” (Photo by Jason Thrasher) Having partnerships helps. SCWDS scientists have crossed cultural, political, and geographical divides to find common ground with individuals who share a deep commitment to wildlife conservation. That’s a significant—and lasting—achievement. “There are things we can do,” said Ruder. “Think about habitat conservation, for example. We can pull together to enable the wildlife population to be more resilient and withstand the impact of these diseases.” Poulson takes the message of hope one step further. “I would tell people to go outside and enjoy this incredible wild world,” she said. “The more we can get out there and understand this world, the more we can care for it. Everyone is on their cell phones all the time, not looking up, not engaging in nature. That doesn’t help. We need to put our phones down and get outdoors. We need to pay attention.” It’s a mission worth going to the woods for.

Their approach differs from previous attempts to craft a universal flu vaccine, by including antigens specific to each subtype, rather than just a smaller set of antigens shared among subtypes. This strategy harnesses the same mRNA technology as that employed in the Pfizer and Moderna SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. The mRNA technology that enabled those COVID-19 vaccines was pioneered at Penn. Tests in animal models showed that the vaccine dramatically reduced signs of illness and protected from death, even when the animals were exposed to flu strains different from those used in making the vaccine. The team suggests that their technology could lead to the development of a universal flu vaccine that protects against potential future pandemics. “The idea here is to have a vaccine that will give people a baseline level of immune memory to diverse flu strains, so that there will be far less disease and death when the next flu pandemic occurs,” said study senior author Scott Hensley, PhD, a professor of microbiology at in the Perelman School of Medicine. Hensley and colleagues reported on the development of their mRNA vaccine in Science, in a report titled, “A multivalent nucleoside-modified mRNA vaccine against all known influenza virus subtypes.” Hensley and his laboratory collaborated in the study with the laboratory of mRNA vaccine pioneer Drew Weissman, MD, PhD, the Roberts Family professor in vaccine research and director of vaccine research at Penn Medicine. Influenza viruses periodically cause pandemics with enormous death tolls. The best known of these was the 1918–19 “Spanish flu” pandemic, which killed tens of millions of people worldwide. Flu viruses can circulate in birds, pigs, and other animals, and pandemics can start when one of these strains jumps to humans and acquires mutations that adapt it better for spreading among humans. The authors explained, “There are at least 18 different influenza A virus (IAV) subtypes that circulate in animal reservoirs, and these viruses occasionally enter the human population and cause a pandemic.” Current flu vaccines are “seasonal” vaccines that protect against recently circulating strains, but would not be expected to protect against new, pandemic strains. And even with increased global surveillance, it is difficult to predict which flu strain will cause the next flu pandemic, making a universal vaccine important. As the investigators noted, “Although surveillance programs and modeling studies have increased our knowledge of pandemic risk, we cannot accurately predict which influenza subtype will cause the next pandemic.” There are several universal influenza vaccines in development to provide protection against diverse influenza virus subtypes, the team continued. Most of these vaccine candidates include a limited number of antigens that have epitopes that are conserved across different influenza virus subtypes. In contrast, the strategy employed by the Penn Medicine researchers is to vaccinate using immunogens—a type of antigen that stimulates immune responses—from all known influenza A and influenza B virus (IBV) subtypes in order to elicit broad protection. This vaccination strategy is not expected to provide “sterilizing” immunity that completely prevents viral infections. “Instead of focusing on immunogens to elicit antibodies against epitopes that are conserved among many different influenza virus strains, we designed a vaccine that encodes separate immunogens from all known IAV subtypes and IBV lineages,” the team explained. Their newly reported study confirmed that the vaccine elicited a memory immune response that can be quickly recalled and adapted to new pandemic viral strains, significantly reducing severe illness and death from infections. “It would be comparable to first-generation SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines, which were targeted to the original Wuhan strain of the coronavirus,” Hensley said. “Against later variants such as Omicron, these original vaccines did not fully block viral infections, but they continue to provide durable protection against severe disease and death.” For their flu vaccine, the researchers prepared 20 different nanoparticle encapsulated mRNAs, each encoding a different hemagglutinin antigen. The experimental mRNA-lipid nanoparticle vaccine developed by Hensley and colleagues encoded hemagglutinin (HA) antigens from all 20 known influenza A and B virus subtypes. When injected and taken up by the cells of recipients, the vaccine then resulted in production of copies of the key flu virus hemagglutinin protein, for all 20 influenza hemagglutinin subtypes—H1 through H18 for influenza A viruses, and two more for influenza B viruses. “For a conventional vaccine, immunizing against all these subtypes would be a major challenge, but with mRNA technology, it’s relatively easy,” Hensley said. Tested in mice, the mRNA vaccine elicited high levels of antibodies, which stayed elevated for at least four months, and reacted strongly to all 20 flu subtypes. Multivalent protein vaccines produced using more traditional methods elicited fewer antibodies and were less protective compared to the multivalent mRNA vaccine in the animals. Moreover, the new vaccine seemed relatively unaffected by prior influenza virus exposures, which can skew immune responses to conventional influenza vaccines. The researchers observed that the antibody response in the mice was strong and broad whether or not the animals had been exposed to flu virus before. The team also carried out tests in ferrets that were vaccinated using a prime-boost approach, and challenged with an avian H1N1 virus, to mimic a pandemic caused by an unknown viral strain. The results of these experiments confirmed that compared with unvaccinated animals challenged by the same virus, the vaccinated ferrets lost less weight, and all survived, whereas two of the four unvaccinated ferrets died. Unvaccinated animals also displayed more clinical signs of disease relative to vaccinated animals after infection. “Further studies will be required to fully elucidate the mechanisms by which the 20-HA mRNA vaccine provides protection,” the authors acknowledged. Their reported findings suggested that protection against antigenically matched strains is mediated by neutralizing antibodies, whereas protection against mismatched viral strains may occur through non-neutralizing mechanisms, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Hensley and his colleagues currently are designing human clinical trials. The researchers envision that, if those trials are successful, the vaccine may be useful for eliciting long-term immune memory against all influenza subtypes in people of all age groups, including young children. “We think this vaccine could significantly reduce the chances of ever getting a severe flu infection,” Hensley said. As the team noted in their report, “It is likely that mRNA influenza vaccines that are imperfectly matched to novel pandemic influenza virus strains will not provide sterilizing immunity but will instead limit disease severity and protect against death through non-neutralizing mechanisms.” In an accompanying perspective, Alyson A Kelvin, PhD, and Darryl Fallzarano, PhD, at the University of Saskatchewan, noted that the strengths of the mRNA platform for pandemic vaccine production include flexibility of antigen design, increased numbers of potential viral targets, speed of production, and inexpensive, scalable manufacturing. “These strengths are important when designing and producing vaccines for a highly diverse, unpredictable family of viruses that can easily spread globally in a matter of weeks,” they noted. However, they commented, “questions remain regarding the regulation and approval pathway of such a vaccine that targets viruses of pandemic potential but are not currently in human circulation.” In principle, Hensley added, the same multivalent mRNA strategy could be used for other viruses with pandemic potential, including coronaviruses. “Multivalent mRNA-LNP vaccines may be applied against other variable pathogens, such as coronaviruses and rhinoviruses,” the scientists concluded. “For example, SARS-CoV-2mRNA vaccines are being updated to include multiple spike components to combat antigenically distinct strains. Additional studies will be required to determine the maximum number of antigens that can be simultaneously delivered through mRNA-LNP vaccines and the underlying immunological mechanisms that allow for the induction of responses against multiple antigens.” NewsCellular, Molecular and Developmental BiologyCOVID-19 vaccineInfectious diseasesInfluenzaMedicine, Diagnosis, and TherapeuticsMessenger RNAMolecular biologyPharmacologyRNA biologySystemic conditionsVaccinesViral diseasesViral vaccineModernaPfizer Ventures Share FacebookTwitterLinkedinReddItEmail Previous articleAutoimmune Diseases May Be Driven by Killer T Cells That Go RogueNext articleAdvanced Biotherapy Regulatory Considerations Sophia Ktori Also of Interest StockWatch: Wall Street Weighs Trump Effect on Biopharma, from Vaccines to M&A Supplier-Turned-Partner: Twist Joins Absci in AI Antibody Collaboration Patient Dies in Beam Trial of SCD Candidate; Company Cites Conditioning Alzheimer’s Drug Shows Slower Cognitive Decline in Lower Tau Patients Synthetic Gene Cascades Timed to Control DNA Nanotube Assembly StockWatch: Investors Hammer Lilly as GLP-1 Sales Miss Forecasts Related Media Avak Kahvejian, PhD, Recounts His Journey from Sequencing Pioneer to Flagship General Partner on "Close to the Edge" Nobel Winner Katalin Karikó Shared mRNA Vaccine Story with GEN, Mid-Pandemic Carl Icahn States His Case for Change at Illumina on "Close to the Edge" Celebrating DNA: Matthew Cobb's Reflections on the Double Helix Emerging Markets Collaborate to Succeed in Post-Pandemic World The Sun Sets on AGBT: A Report from the Last Day Related Content StockWatch: Wall Street Weighs Trump Effect on Biopharma, from Vaccines to M&A Supplier-Turned-Partner: Twist Joins Absci in AI Antibody Collaboration Patient Dies in Beam Trial of SCD Candidate; Company Cites Conditioning Alzheimer’s Drug Shows Slower Cognitive Decline in Lower Tau Patients Read the Digital Edition ExploreAbout GEN Contact GEN GEN Staff Editorial Guidelines Reprints and Permissions Scientific Advisory Board AdvertiseMedia Kit and Planning Calendar Advertising Terms and Conditions ResourcesGet the GEN Magazine Get the GEN Email Newsletter Inside Precision Medicine Privacy Policy Copyright © 2024 Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology News.

"It's a very cruel death whether it was foul play or not," he said. There's been at least half a dozen found dead in the past week. "I've been here 15 years and I never seen, once in a blue moon a duck dies, but never like this, six or seven, never," he said.Another duck at the complex is showing signs of sickness too. Capurso initially thought there was foul play, but wildlife experts say it could be something else. "That could be either botulism, which is a toxin from a bacterium in the soil," said Dr. Charlotte Cournoyer from the South Florida Wildlife Center. "The other thing we're really concerned about right now is highly-pathogenic avian influenza." She is especially worried about avian influenza. "We've seen at least 50 Muscovy ducks come in with these symptoms in the last month. And a lot of times people bring us the sick duck, but there were more dead ducks back at the pond." State wildlife officials are monitoring avian flu cases. It's shown up all over the state, including here in Broward and Miami-Dade. Humans are feeling the impact too. While there are rare cases of spread to people, this is also a pocketbook issue at the grocery store. "In 2022 alone, 50 million birds in the poultry industry have been affected by this virus. It is 90-100% fatal so it has huge economic impacts as well as a threat to our native wildlife," she said. Wildlife officials say if you come in contact with a sick or dead bird, do not touch it.

A better understanding of the molecular regulation in tissue and cells upon IAV infection is needed to thoroughly understand pathogenesis. We analyzed IAV replication and gene expression induced by IAV strain H3N2 Panama in isolated primary human alveolar epithelial type II cells (AECIIs), the permanent A549 adenocarcinoma cell line, alveolar macrophages (AMs) and explanted human lung tissue by bulk RNA sequencing. Primary AECII exhibit in comparison to AM a broad set of strongly induced genes related to RIG-I and interferon (IFN) signaling. The response of AECII was partly mirrored in A549 cells. In human lung tissue, we observed induction of genes unlike in isolated cells. Viral RNA was used to correlate host cell gene expression changes with viral burden. While relative induction of key genes was similar, gene abundance was highest in AECII cells and AM, while weaker in the human lung (due to less IAV replication) and A549 cells (pointing to their limited suitability as a model). Correlation of host gene induction with viral burden allows a better understanding of the cell-type specific induction of pathways and a possible role of cellular crosstalk requiring intact tissue.

It remains one of the diseases with the highest mortality rates in children under five and older adults worldwide1. There has been little improvement in morbidity and mortality rates, despite vaccination strategies. One of the most common pneumonia-causing pathogens is influenza A virus (IAV)2. The rapid emergence of new IAV strains results in annual epidemics and occasional pandemics of acute respiratory illness in the human population3. For this reason, there is an urgent need to gain more knowledge about the molecular basis of the initial molecular host response, the cellular crosstalk and the pathogen-host interaction, particularly in human lung tissue, to understand most critical signaling pathways of this zoonotic disease.The main target cells for IAV infection and replication in the human alveolus are alveolar type II epithelial cells (AECII)4,5. However, also alveolar macrophages (AM) are permissive, although the efficiency of virus replication is dependent on the viral strain and macrophage type6. Together, these cells play a critical role for the host defense and innate immune response by a coordinated cellular cross-talk4,7.Studies in mice exhibit that AECII, compared to AM, activate a broader range of physiological responses including antiviral pathways in response to IAV infection8. However, differences between mice and men regarding cell differentiation and substantial diversification of lung cell types during mammalian evolution9,10,11 underline the importance of using human models that reflect both the tissue physiology and the clinical situation of the patient in the best possible way. Thus, we established a comprehensive map of differential gene expression in primary human AECIIs, AMs, and lung tissue explants. Previous studies have been done with various techniques and they were conducted at different stages of “omics”-development12,13,14, which makes comparison difficult. Also, they have not been done in parallel, nor with the same virus strain. In contrast, our study is the first systematic comparison between responses towards IAV infection for primary in vivo targets and the A549 cell line. Our analyses identified a shared core set of genes induced upon infection, including members of the IFITM and OAS gene family, but also highlighting cell-type specific differences with regard to relative induction upon infection, hence pathway enrichment, and absolute transcript abundance. The model of primary human lung tissue infected ex vivo provides further insight into the interplay between AMs and AECIIs and potential involvement of other cell types such as dendritic cells. AECII exhibited a broad set of strongly-induced genes, prominently related to RIG-I and interferon (IFN) signaling, which were induced to a lesser extent in the A549 cell line, which is widely used as IAV infection model. Although this adenocarcinoma-derived cell line expresses some characteristic features of ATII cells including synthesis of phospholipids, cytoplasmic lamellar bodies, and apical microvilli15 differences were shown in their response to virus infection including interferon and cell death signaling16. In conclusion, our study systematically defines the transcriptomic responses of the different sample types and allows direct comparison due to our stringent approach of parallel infection with the same virus strain.Materials and methodsCell culture and human lung tissueA549 cells (ATCC, CCL-185) were cultured in Ham’s F12 medium and MDCKII (Dog, kidney) cells in Minimum Essential Medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mM l-glutamine at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells were cultured up to passage 10 and then relaunched from frozen stock.Peripheral human lung tissue was obtained from patients suffering from bronchial carcinoma. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin (Project EA2/079/13). Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. Tumor-free peripheral lung tissue was processed as previously described4,5,17 and patient data are summarized in Table 1.Table 1 Clinical patient data for used human lung tissue as far as known.Full size tableAMs were isolated by repeated perfusion of the human lung tissue with Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS). The resulting cells were seeded and cultured in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium supplemented with 2% FCS and 2 mM l-glutamine under the conditions described above.AECIIs were isolated as previously described18 with modifications. Briefly, human lung tissue was perfused to remove AMs as stated above and the remaining tissue was finely minced and digested with type I trypsin and DNase. The digested tissue was filtered and cells were incubated in hybridoma serum-free medium (SFM) to promote the differential adhesion of residual AMs. The cell fraction was then collected and layered on a Pancoll discontinuous gradient. Cells at the interfacial layer were collected, washed with HBSS and finally cells were seeded and cultured in RPMI 1649 medium supplemented with 10% FCS and 2 mM l-glutamine under the conditions described above4.Viral strainThe human seasonal IAV strain A/Panama/2007/1999 (Pan/99[H3N2]) was propagated in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells as previously described5. Virus stocks were titrated on MDCKII cells using a standard plaque assay.Ex vivo infection of human lung tissue and cellsLung organ cultures were either mock-infected with infection medium (RPMI 1649 medium supplemented with 0.3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 2 mM l-glutamine) or inoculated with 1 × 106 plaque-forming units (PFU) of Pan/99[H3N2] diluted in infection medium using a disposable syringe and needle as described4,5,19. Infection was done in a 200 µl volume of infection or control medium per 100 mg lung tissue. After 1.5 h, excess virus was removed by 3 washing steps with PBS. The lung tissue explants were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. A549 cells, AMs and AECIIs were either mock-infected with infection medium or challenged with Pan/99[H3N2] at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1. After 1.5 h, excess virus was removed by 3 washing steps with PBS. Cells were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere.Infectious particle quantificationInfectious particles were quantified by plaque titration on MDCKII cells. Briefly, cell monolayers were seeded in 24-well plates, incubated with virus-containing cell culture supernatants and overlaid with 1.2% Avicel in appropriate medium. After 48 h cells were washed two times with PBS and plaques were fixed and visualized by staining with crystal violet.Isolation of total RNA and cDNA synthesisTotal RNA was isolated using the Direct-zol RNA Kit (Zymo Research, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Human lung tissue was transferred to Lysing Matrix D tubes (MP Biomedicals, Germany) in 500 μl TRIzol reagent. The tissue was lysed using a FastPrep-24 device (MP Biomedicals) by applying four rounds of tissue lysis at default settings (4 m/s, 20 s). Cells were directly lysed in 500 μl TRIzol reagent. The homogenates were centrifuged and 0.5 µg of RNA purified from the supernatant was reverse transcribed for the profiling of IFN subtypes using the RT2 Profiler Kit (Qiagen, Germany).RNA sequencingRNA from infected samples was purified as described above and 500 ng was used for library preparation and sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq 1500 in the Philipps University Marburg Sequencing Core Facility. Reads were mapped using CLC Workbench v10.0 (Qiagen). Viral reads were detected by mapping against a hybrid virus/human reference. Differential gene expression was computed as logarithmic fold change with the DeSeq2 Package20 in R v3.5.2. Genes were considered differentially expressed at padj. < 0.05 (Benjamini–Hochberg corrected for multiple testing). For the representation of gene abundance as an important additional information to interpret fold-change data, transcripts per million (TPM) values were computed, z-score transformed and represented in heatmaps. Pathway enrichment analysis was carried out using the R package gprofiler221 and Qiagen Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Transcription factor enrichment was calculated using CiiiDER22. Correlation analysis was carried out by computing the Pearson correlation coefficient of genes with a selected single gene or composite ratio of viral NA and host ACTB. Data are deposited at NCBI GEO under the accession number GSE206606. All gene groups utilized are listed in table S1.ELISACell-free and tissue-free supernatants were assayed 24 h following infection for release of Interferon α, β, γ, and λ1 by ELISA (PBL Assay Science, USA; eBioscience, USA) following the manufacturer´s instructions.StatisticsStatistical analysis not pertaining to RNA sequencing was carried out using PRISM v6 (GraphPad Software, USA) and data are presented as the mean ± standard error (SEM) of at least three donors representing independent experiments.ResultsTranscriptional analysis reveals that IAV infection induces numerous pathways exclusively in primary AECIIs compared to A549 cellsTo validate the permissiveness of all four culture models for IAV we infected human lung tissue explants, AECII cells, AM and A549 cells with the seasonal IAV strain Pan/99[H3N2] and observed efficient replication of the virus in all used host systems (Fig. S1). We then investigated the cell-specific responses to IAV infection by initially comparing virus-modulated genes in A549 cells and AECIIs. We identified 592 genes that were exclusively upregulated in AECIIs, 503 genes that were exclusively upregulated in A549 cells, and 468 genes that were upregulated in both (Fig. 1A). Among the 468 shared genes, z-score hierarchical clustering revealed that many of the corresponding mRNAs were less abundant in A549 cells than in AECIIs, under resting conditions and during infection (Fig. 1B). A smaller number of mRNAs were similarly abundant in both cell types (fraction 3) or more abundant in A549 cells (fraction 1). Pathway enrichment analysis yielded very similar results (Fig. 1C, Figure S2). We next investigated pathway enrichment signatures in genes that were exclusively upregulated in one particular cell type, revealing pathways that were only activated in AECIIs (Fig. S3A). Closer investigation of two representative pathways (antiviral mechanism by IFN-stimulated genes and RIG-I like receptor signaling) indicated that only a part of the genes were induced by IAV infection in A549 cells. The Type I and II IFN response of A549 cells consequently appears to be diminished relative to AECIIs shown in an independent experiment on the RNA (Fig. S3B) and partly on the protein level (Fig. S7B). Of note, among the genes which are more abundant in A549 is e.g. TRIM31, which has been described as oncogenic 23.Figure 1Comparative transcriptional analysis of AECIIs and A549 cells during IAV infection. (A) 592 genes are exclusively induced in AECII cells, 503 genes are exclusively induced in A549 cells, and there is a shared set of 468 induced genes. (B) The corresponding mRNAs of the shared set differ in abundance and relative induction between the two cell types (1 = similar genes, 2 = more pronounced induction in AECIIs, 3 = more pronounced induction in A549 cells). (C) Gene Ontology (GO) categories (BP = biological process, CC = cell compartment, MP = molecular process) and database classifications (KEGG = Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, REAC = reactome database) highlights different pathway enrichment patterns for these three gene sets. Parts of this Figure were made with Biorender.Full size imageInduction of common antiviral responses in AMs and AECIIs as well as AECII-specific pathwaysNext, we characterized the cell-specific responses to IAV strain Pan/99[H3N2] in more detail by comparing AMs and AECIIs. As expected, the shared upregulated genes (n = 620) revealed a strong enrichment of defense responses and IFN pathways. Many more genes were upregulated specifically in AMs (n = 1061) than in AECIIs (n = 440) (Fig. 2A, Fig. S4). Analysis of the AM-specific genes yielded only weak pathway enrichment (not shown), whereas the AECII-specific genes showed a clear enrichment of the Gene Ontology (GO) terms cytokine-mediated signaling pathway and immune response, among others. A set of 79 genes (Table S1) associated with the GO term immune response was found in the AECII-exclusive Venn diagram section from panel 2A, which were more abundant in AM (Fig. 2B). Their mean relative fold change upon infection was significantly weaker in AM vs. AECII (Fig. 2C).Figure 2Comparison of virus-induced genes between AM and AEC yielded a strong shared antiviral response and a set of enriched pathways that was driven by AEC-specific genes (A). The top 10 of these pathways as ranked by p value are shown. Exemplary candidates from the GO term “Immune Response” show that the lack of virus induced genes from this pathway in AM is due to a high basal abundance of these genes. Z- scores were calculated on the basis of transcripts per million (TPM) (B). Broad lack of relative gene induction in AM was confirmed when investigating all 79 genes from this pathway that were part of the AECII-exclusive Venn section (C). Statistical significance was assessed by ANOVA with tukey correction for multiple testing. ***p < 0.001.

Parts of this Figure were made with Biorender.Full size imageIAV triggers a broad transcriptional response in primary human cells and whole lung tissue, which can be further resolved by mRNA abundanceWe next analyzed primary human lung samples to reveal crosstalk-dependent gene expression between AECII and AM. While the analysis of cell-exclusive genes yielded pathway enrichment patterns with low-confidence (Figure S5), we identified 302 genes that were upregulated in the human lung, AECIIs and AMs (Fig. 3A). Principal component analysis (PCA) of these genes revealed good separation of the different sample types. Principal component 1 (PC1) clustered samples according to infection status, PC2 separated human lung tissue from AECII, and PC3 separated AECII from AM. The union of the 30 genes with the highest loading per principal component are illustrated as heatmap, showing abundance differences in the respective sample types. IFITM1, IFITM2 and IFITM3, e.g., were genes with high abundance in the human lung. Conversely, OAS1, OAS2 and OAS3, e.g., showed a reduced abundance in the human lung compared to AECII and AM. (Fig. 3B).Figure 3Infection with IAV leads to a broad transcriptional response in primary human cells and in whole lung tissue. (A) A set of 302 induced genes is shared as a common response between all cell types (a core set of genes), but the expression level of these genes differs across cell types. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to resolve the contribution of individual genes from this core signature to the different transcriptional landscapes. PC1 separated control samples from infected samples, PC2 separated AECII from human lung samples, and PC3 separated AECII from AM. Z-scores of genes driving sample separation were calculated on the basis of transcripts per million (TPM) and are shown as a heatmap (B). Parts of this Figure were made with Biorender.Full size imageAECII secrete a broader range of IFNs than AMs and their IFN target genes are induced more strongly by viral infectionNext we used CiiiDER to identify overrepresented and underrepresented transcription factors that may cause the observed gene expression profiles22. We probed all cell-specific and overlapping Venn diagram sectors from Fig. 3A. The transcription factors representing the shared fraction of 302 genes were highly enriched for IRFs (IFN response factors, Fig. 4A). For each cell type, there was a unique landscape of transcription factor enrichment and depletion. The AECII-specific gene set yielded a highly significant positive enrichment of the STAT1:STAT2 heterodimer and of IRF2, IRF7 and IRF8. The AM-specific gene set yielded a weak positive enrichment of transcription factors such as Hoxd8 and NFIA. In the human lung, the most enriched transcription factors were ATF1 and E2F4 (Fig. S6).Figure 4Infection with IAV leads to the broad upregulation of genes in primary human lung cells and in whole lung tissue. (A) A set of 302 genes is shared as a common response between all cell types, which is strongly enriched in IRF-responsive genes. Genes that were not regulated in response to IAV served as reference matrix. (B–E) Sets of IFN target genes as inferred by Ingenuity pathway analysis (IFNγ, n = 139; IFNλ1, n = 64; IFNα, n = 128; IFNβ, n = 41) show a significantly stronger average induction upon viral infection in AECII compared to AM and lung as determined by ANOVA with tukey correction for multiple testing. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 versus AM #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01 vs. human lung.Full size imageTo identify hallmark events of viral gene induction that shape the observed transcriptional patterns, we extracted gene sets that were upregulated exclusively in one cell type. We grouped the differentially expressed genes by potential upstream regulators as inferred by Qiagen Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. The upstream regulators predicted with the highest confidence were IFNγ and IFNλ (p < 1 × 10–60 for each overlap). The IFNγ response, illustrated by these target genes (Table S1), was pronounced in AECIIs but significantly weaker in human lung samples and also AMs (Fig. 4D). We compared these data to IFN expression levels in AECIIs and AMs, revealing that AECIIs induce a broader panel of type I IFNs than AMs upon influenza infection (Fig. S7A). We additionally performed ELISA for four prototypic interferons (Figure S7B). The different biological systems secrete different amounts of interferons upon infection, and AECII are the most potent producers of IFNγ RNA and protein. Notably, AECIIs induce IFNλ1 and IFNα, but not IFNβ, target genes to a higher level compared to AM and lung. (Fig. 4B,C,E).Correlation with viral transcripts identifies a core set of cellular defense genesIn order to account for the differences in viral load (Fig. S1) when exploring gene expression, we identified viral transcripts in the infected cells as indicator of viral burden. The abundance (transcripts per million, TPM) of the eight IAV transcripts HA, M1, NA, NP, NS1, PA, PB1 and PB2 was broadly comparable across all four sample types, with a tendency towards lower abundance in the lung samples (Fig. 5A). As NA was the most evenly expressed viral transcript across all sample types, we normalized the NA transcript counts to human ACTB transcript (encoding the housekeeping factor β-actin) in order to derive a coefficient that reflects the viral load per sample. We then correlated host gene expression with this ratio. From the pool of shared upregulated genes (Fig. 3A), we extracted 29 candidates that correlated (Pearson Coefficient > 0.7) with this ratio coefficient and showed similar relative induction across cell types (Fig. 5B). For these genes, we observed strong pathway enrichment for cellular defense signaling (Fig. 5C, S8). Looking at these genes individually revealed that, while their mean relative fold change was similar, abundance patterns were different across cell types (Fig. 5D). We summarize expression patterns, interactions and cellular context of selected genes identified in this study in a graphic representation (Fig. 6 and Table S1).Figure 5Viral sequences retrieved from infected samples show comparable infection rates across all cell types. Sequences obtained from RNA sequencing were mapped against a hybrid reference genome of human and H3N2 Panama virus. (A) Transcripts per million (TPM) and cell type are shown as mean + SEM. Uninfected cells (not shown) showed TPMs below 10 for viral transcripts. (B) Genes from the shared upregulated pool (302 genes) that correlate (Pearson > 0.7) with the ratio of viral NA mRNA to cellular β-actin (ACTB) mRNA (n = 29) show a mean similar induction across all cell types (B). These genes show a high enrichment of the cellular defence response pathways (C). While the relative induction is similar, abundance across all cell types is different as shown by z-score (D). Classifications: BP = biological process, CC = cell compartment, MP = molecular process, KEGG = Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, REAC = reactome database.Full size imageFigure 6Hallmark genes of the antiviral response are shown in their cellular context with their fold-change regulation in the different biological systems. Details on the interaction between nodes are derived from Qiagen Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and are given in Table S1. Parts of this Figure were made with Biorender.Full size imageCorrelation of selected genes with published single cell sequencing dataIn order to test the fidelity of selected findings from our approach in a single cell sequencing setup, we used a published single cell sequencing dataset that included infection of human lung samples with Pan/99[H3N2]19. We can show that correlation of genes that we show to differ between AM and AECII (Fig. 2C) also show poor correlation in the single cell sequencing data (R = 0.28, Figure S9A), while genes that we show to be similar between AM and AECII (Fig. 5D) show a good correlation in the single cell sequencing data (R = 0.83, Figure S9B).DiscussionTo gain insight into the host response to IAV infection, and specifically the influence of different human cell types and the crosstalk between them24, we established a comprehensive map of differential gene expression in primary human AECIIs, AMs, and lung tissue explants under resting conditions and during IAV infection with the Pan/99[H3N2] virus strain. We chose this strain because at the time of experimentation, Pan/99 had been selected by the WHO as a prototypic H3N2 vaccine strain, thereby representing many other circulating IAV strains. Furthermore, there is a reverse genetic system available that will allow to assess the contributions of distinct genetic determinants to the phenotypes of Pan/99 in the infection models of future studies25. The sequencing data we obtained from our infection experiments are deposited at NCBI GEO under the accession number GSE206606. Together, our biological models provide insight into the interplay between AMs and AECIIs by allowing the comparison of lung tissue to each cell type cultured in isolation. We also compared primary human AECIIs to the A549 cell line, which is derived from a human alveolar epithelial cell adenocarcinoma and used in many IAV studies. While many of the aspects of cellular responses towards IAV have been studied in the literature12,13,14, this is the first systematic study comparing four different relevant human respiratory host systems by RNA sequencing. This allowed us to establish with high confidence the significant differences in gene expression between A549 cells and AECIIs, as well as broad similarities but also nuanced differences between AECIIs, AMs and human lung samples upon IAV infection. We furthermore measured the viral load in each cell type by quantifying viral transcripts and derived from this a cell-specific transcriptional response to the viral burden, which enabled us to explore key gene expression while accounting for different viral load per sample.AECIIs are the major target of IAV in the human lung4,5. Infection generally results in productive virus replication, whereas immune cell populations (including AMs) tend to be less permissive or even non-permissive to productive replication by seasonal IAV6. Furthermore, AECIIs and AMs sense and respond differently to IAV infections. They differ in the sialic acid linkages displayed on the cell surface, which affects their susceptibility to infection26, and they produce distinct patterns of inflammatory mediators in response to IAV27. The analysis of gene regulation in these cells revealed that the less pronounced relative induction of gene expression in infected AMs reflected the higher basal level of immunoactive genes, e.g. SAMHD1, ELF1 or ERAP128,29,30. However, the first line of defense against viruses is the production of IFNs31, which exert their antiviral functions mainly via the JAK/STAT pathway32,33. Interestingly, transcription factor enrichment analysis suggested that STAT1:STAT2 heterodimers were primarily active in AECIIs, correlating with our observation of strong IFN expression in these cells. We may therefore have identified a component of IFN signaling that is mainly active in AECIIs and to a lesser extent in AMs, and which may be an innate feature of the cellular response and/or an indicator that the virus interferes with this response to a different extent in the two cell types.Primary human AECIIs are known to lose their phenotype and capacity for surfactant synthesis during standard in vitro cultivation34. The human pulmonary adenocarcinoma cell line A549 is therefore used extensively as a model, even though its suitability is a matter of discussion35,36. We correlated our A549 gene expression data with the public dataset GSE169309, which included a 24 h infection setting of A549 cells with H3N2 influenza. We observed an overall correlation coefficient of R = 0.79 (data not shown), which corroborates the response pattern of our A549 cells to infection. Our further comparison of A549 cells with our primary AECIIs revealed a broadly similar antiviral response in both cell types, but multiple pathways induced in AECIIs showed limited or zero activity in A549 cells because the corresponding genes were not induced by infection. As examples, we observed the non-expression of IFNA2 and IFNA8 (antiviral mechanism by IFN-stimulated genes) and IFITM1 and IFITM2 (RIG-I like receptor signaling). This indicates that A549 cells mount a more limited cytokine response than primary cells, and have a diminished capacity to sense the virus via RIG-I and respond with an appropriate IFN signal. On the other hand, A549 cells show comparable or even increased gene induction in comparison to AECII, e.g. in the case of DDX58 (RIG-I), ISG15, IRF7, and PNPT1, indicating their partially intact response pattern to IAV infection.A clear limitation of our study is the bulk nature of our sequencing data. While we believe that the bulk approach has its advantages over single cell sequencing, notably sparing the cells from the physical stress of separation and less room for data misinterpretation due to lower complexity, we clearly do not achieve the level of resolution that single cell sequencing would have provided. Therefore, we show the induction of two sets of key genes identified in our study in a single cell sequencing dataset. A further intriguing aspect that goes beyond the scope of this study is the dependency of the virus life cycle and gene expression regulation on the chosen biological host system. As our paper highlights the cell-type specific differences in the host response, we expect that these differences also impact on viral gene expression and viral assembly. Furthermore, to maintain consistency and reproducibility, and to interpret findings in the proper context, it is essential to take into account the limitations of 2D cell cultures when using them to model aspects of organ function. Besides AECII and AM, ex vivo cultured alveolar tissue contains at least AECI and microvascular endothelial cells as well as resident immune cells, which may impact on the IAV-related tissue activation in situ. Therefore, we also investigated the gene expression patterns in whole lung human tissue. We established a core signature that was shared by all primary models, and on the basis of these transcripts compared all three models by PCA. PC1 separated uninfected from infected samples, PC2 separated human lung tissue from AECII, and PC3 separated AECII from AM. In order to account for the markedly reduced replication of virus in the human lung, we focused on the genes driving PCA separation and found IFITM1, IFITM2 and IFITM3 to be particularly abundant in the human lung. As this gene family has reported antiviral properties37, they might explain partly why the herein used IAV strain showed lesser growth in whole lung tissue. RelA, which has the highest induction and abundance also in the lung samples might also account for this observation, as it enables NF-κB activation and subsequent pro-inflammatory gene transcription38. Furthermore, ARID5A, which we highlight as most abundant in the human lung, has been described to stabilize transcripts such as IL6, STAT3 and TNFRSF439, which we have found in the highest abundance in the human lung, albeit not further induced by IAV infection. On the other hand, the transcripts of OAS1, OAS2 and OAS3, which are also described as antiviral40, show a lesser abundance in the human lung compared to AECII. Likewise, the lung showed the lowest abundance and induction of IFNB1 upon IAV infection. These findings illustrate the differential transcription status of core signature genes in the different primary models. We furthermore found the abundant transcript for the dendritic cell maturation factor FLT3LG which suggests the presence of dendritic cells41 that contribute to the distinct transcriptional profile of the complete tissue compared to isolated cell types.Viral transcripts were detected as indicator of the viral burden in the infected cells and their abundance was correlated with host gene expression. We observed a comparable relative induction of host genes that correlated with viral burden across all cell types, but we also saw less abundance of these genes in human lung tissue and A549 cells. This again argues for the complex crosstalk in the human lung tissue which might exert inhibitory effects on gene expression, and it highlights the shortcomings of isolated cells. Usage of 2D cell culture of isolated primary cells and in particular cell lines comes with severe limitations because of the lack of 3D tissue integrity. Intact tissue and in the future, organoids, represent a much more physiological model to study ongoing infection42,43,44. We have comprehensively mapped the shared and exclusive transcriptional responses to IAV H3N2 infection in AMs, AECIIs, A549 cells, and importantly, human lung tissue. The similarities and differences we report will assist careful selection of cell culture models and their performance.

Also, COVID-19 variants continue to shift, with cases, hospitalizations, and deaths showing small rises.H3N2 still dominant, but vaccines still a good matchIn its latest FluView update, the CDC said 35 states are experiencing high or very high activity, with only 6 still reporting low activity, mostly in the north. At the national level, the percentage of respiratory samples that tested positive for flu at clinical labs rose from 14.7% to 18.2%. Positivity rose in most CDC regions, remained stable in the south-central states, and declined in the southeast.H3N2 is still the dominant strain, making up 78% of influenza A samples. Seasons dominated by H3N2 are known to be tough on seniors and young children, and the virus is known to evolve to evade protection from the H3N2 component of the vaccine. But so far, the CDC said the majority of flu viruses tested are similar to the viruses included in this year's seasonal flu vaccines.The percentage of outpatient visits for flulike illness, which can reflect activity from other respiratory viruses, rose slightly from 5.8% to 6%.For hospitalizations, the cumulative rate per 100,000 population was 11.3%, the highest for this point in the year since the 2010-2011 flu season. The highest rates are in seniors, followed by children ages 0 to 4 years old.Five more pediatric flu deaths were reported, bringing the season's total to 12. The deaths occurred between early October and the middle of November. All involved influenza A. Of two subtyped viruses, one was H1N1 and the other was H3N2.US COVID markers edge upwardMeanwhile, the 7-day average for new daily COVID-19 cases today is 43,692, up 8% compared to a week ago, according to the Washington Post tracker. Similarly, the daily average for deaths is 379, up 24% from last week. And likewise, hospitalizations are up 5%.Though small, the uptick in COVID-19 activity is occurring against the backdrop of the steadily rising proportion of Omicron subvariants BQ.1 and BQ.1.1, which are known to more easily evade earlier protection from vaccination or previous infection.In its last variant proportion estimates, the CDC said the original BA.5 Omicron subvariant now makes up only 19.4% of sequenced samples. BQ.1 now makes up 27.9%, with BQ.1.1 making up 29.4%. XBB, an Omicron variant recombinant fueling outbreaks in Asia, is rising slowly and currently makes up 3.1%.In other COVID developments, protests in China over the country's "zero COVID" policy flared in at least 10 major cities over the past several days, with the country experiencing a sharp rise in daily cases.In Shanghai, for example, protesters clashed with police and called for the removal of China's president and the end of Chinese Community Party rule, according to CBS News. The rare protests were partly triggered by anger over the deaths of 10 people in an apartment fire in which the response was reportedly delayed due to excessive lockdown measures.

That’s as high as the peak of the 2017-18 flu season and higher than any season since.The annual winter flu season usually doesn’t get going until December or January, but this one began early and has been complicated by the simultaneous spread of other viruses.The measure of traffic in doctor’s offices is based on reports of symptoms like coughs and sore throats, not on lab-confirmed diagnoses. So it may include other respiratory illnesses.That makes it hard to compare to flu seasons from before the COVID-19 pandemic. Other years also didn’t have this year’s unusually strong wave of RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, a common cause of cold-like symptoms that can be serious for infants and the elderly.Meanwhile, 44 states reported high or very high flu activity last week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday. Oregon and Washington are both in the very high category.This graphic shows the percent of positive flu tests in Oregon since 2017.That may not bode well for the near future. It’s likely there was more spread of respiratory viruses during Thanksgiving gatherings and at crowded airports, experts say.The dominant flu strain so far is the kind typically associated with higher rates of hospitalizations and deaths, particularly in people 65 and older.The CDC estimates there have been at least 78,000 hospitalizations and 4,500 deaths from flu so far this season. The deaths include at least 14 children.In the tri-county Portland area, 7,583 people tested positive for the flu and 78 people were hospitalized in the week ending Nov. 26th, the most recent data released by the Oregon Health Authority. That is a 56% increase in hospitalizations from the previous week.RECOMMENDED•oregonlive.comLakeridge’s Chloe Huyler wins gold, Lincoln unseats Jesuit for Class 6A cross country titleNov. 9, 2024, 6:49 p.m.Poachers exploit demand for eagle feathers, sacred among Native AmericansNov. 7, 2024, 9:00 a.m.Flu shots are recommended for nearly all Americans who are at least 6 months old or older.-- The Associated Press and The Oregonian/OregonLive contributedOur journalism needs your support.

"With this group, they communicate that to me. I listen to my players."After stating there were "flu symptoms" in the group, he continued. ADVERTISEMENT "We are not going to elaborate on that," he said. "But if it goes around in the group, it is worrying."[Scouting the Netherlands: Are the Dutch vulnerable against U.S.?]The disruption, believed to have been due to high air conditioning at the team base, should not be underestimated.Part of Dutch soccer philosophy involves having the starting XI play a game against the reserves two days before match, with the second-stringers to replicate the playing style of the opponent – much like a scout team in the National Football League.To depart from that at this stage of the tournament is striking. Given that there are 26 players on the Netherlands squad like with every World Cup team, it has been suggested by Dutch journalists that at least six players were affected badly enough not to train. Had there been 21 fit players, assistant coach Edgar Davids – a former national team superstar – would likely have been drafted in to fill the final training spot.The only comment from the players on the matter came from midfielders Frenkie de Jong and Marten de Roon earlier in the week. De Jong complained of a scratchy throat that impacted his ability to communicate during the Group A victory over Qatar, while de Roon said he had a cold after reporters noticed his eyes watering.Netherlands-U.S. preview: How does USMNT match up? USA head coach Gregg Berhalter said his coaching staff and members of the squad's administrative support had been ill during the early part of their trip to the Middle East, but that they were fine now and that the players had experienced no such concerns."I'm good," captain Tyler Adams said.As for van Gaal, a veteran coach who has previously taken charge of Manchester United, Barcelona and Bayern Munich, he also sought to turn up the pressure on Saturday's referee (Brazil's Wilton Sampaio) by putting the focus on the tournament's officiating and indicating his team had been unfairly treated so far."You saw the three refs the Netherlands has experienced," van Gaal said. "Well, I think we can start a discussion on that as well."Football is a physical sport, it is simply a trend in the first three matches that I saw we made more fouls than the opponent, but I think we had 50-60% ball possession."The Dutch media, strongly critical of van Gaal and the Netherlands' performances during this tournament, expressed general concern that the USA may have the edge in midfielder going into the game at Khalifa International Stadium.Adams, Yunus Musah and Weston McKennie have been a combined force, while Dutch hopes with be likely pinned on central trio of de Jong, de Roon and Davy Klaassen.Despite, the Netherlands' pedigree as a three-time World Cup finalist, van Gaal was adamant his group would not be taking the Americans lightly."The USA has demonstrated that it has an excellent team, I would even say one of the best teams," he said. "A team that is fine-tuned, a very tough match. I am not going to downplay the USA. I think they are an example of what a good team is supposed to be."Beating Netherlands would be best moment in U.S. history Read more from the World Cup:Christian Pulisic injury update: Doing 'everything in my power' to play SaturdayWhy USMNT captain Tyler Adams is the ideal leader for Gregg BerhalterNetherlands has gotten results — but hasn't impressed back homeUSA's Tim Weah talks World Cup goal, beating Iran: 'Moment of my life'World Cup Power Rankings: USA cracks top 10, Brazil is No. 1Top stories from FOX Sports:Week 13 NFL preview: Predictions, analysis, key matchups and stats for every gameWhy Patriots linebacker Matthew Judon is one of Bill Belichick’s best-ever signingsCollege football bowl projections: Ohio State or Penn State to the Rose Bowl?Justin Verlander is 39.

Here's why doctors think it happensCanadians have been getting sick enough with seasonal flu to land in hospital, say doctors with suggestions on who is most at risk and what it could mean for festive gatherings.Earlier flu season than normal has started to hit Canadian hospitalsAmina Zafar · CBC News · Posted: Dec 01, 2022 4:00 AM EST | Last Updated: December 1, 2022Licensed nurse practitioner Christine Melanson prepares doses of the H1N1 influenza vaccine at the Dr. Everett Chalmers Hospital in Fredericton, N.B. in 2009. The 2009 H1N1 pandemic continues to affect how younger ones do with flu, doctors say. (David Smith/The Canadian Press)Social SharingCanadians have been getting sick enough with seasonal flu to land in hospital, say doctors with suggestions on who is most at risk and what it could mean for festive gatherings."We're starting to now see the effect of flu on certain populations, particularly very young children and very older people, in making them sick enough that they need to come into hospital," said Dr. Gerald Evans, chair of the division of infectious diseases at Queen's University and Kingston Health Sciences Centre.During the depths of the COVID-19 pandemic, air travel declined. It's one of the suspected reasons that influenza all but disappeared, Evans said.Flu viruses need human hosts travelling between the southern and northern hemispheres to gain a foothold during winter on both ends of the planet, according to influenza experts.Dr. Upton Allen, head of infectious diseases at Sick Kids Hospital, said the H3N2 strain of influenza might be associated with more severe disease than other strains. (SickKids)For about 100 years, doctors have known that the youngest and oldest are most at risk for serious flu. Why hasn't been nailed down, but there are a few possible reasons — including what strains were circulating when you were first exposed.Generational effects exploredCanadian and international research on humans as well as in animal models suggest that the first strain of flu virus you're infected with tends to prime or shape the immune system. The result is that our immune system responds best to the original type of flu infection it faced."That's why we believe that older people who are mostly primed with H1N1 don't do very well during an H3N2 year like we're having this year," Evans said.Staff at pediatric hospitals like Sick Kids continue to face pressures from pandemic backlogs of surgeries. (Michael Wilson/CBC)The 2009 H1N1 pandemic also continues to affect how younger ones do with flu.Those aged 13 and under were probably primed to H1N1 after 2009, just as their grandparents were in their childhoods, Evans said.If so, today's kids could be more vulnerable to severe disease from flu now than their parents' generation who first encountered an H3N2 strain.Evans added it's also thought that older people may have more severe outcomes from flu because of underlying problems such as heart disease, lung disease or treatments for cancer.Youngest hadn't been exposed Another reason why young children are being hit hard by flu and RSV this year: recent pandemic public health measures meant those under two haven't seen flu at all and preschoolers haven't experienced it or another respiratory virus known as respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, for a couple seasons."The boost of immunity they get from having had some prior exposures in the year before are missing and so they're tending to get infected more," Evans said. Dr. Upton Allen, chief of infectious diseases at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, pointed to a few other possibilities.One is the strain of flu virus that's mainly circulating. It's officially called Influenza A H3N2, which Allen said might be associated with more severe disease.Why 'stay home when sick' matters so much right nowHer son's heart surgery has been cancelled twice. It's happening all over CanadaAlso, our immune system is considered weakest at the extremes of life."The overwhelming majority of kids who get the flu will get it mild, but some people can get it severe," Allen said.WATCH | Masking back up:What would it take to get us to wear masks again? | About That2 years agoDuration 23:16Health experts in Canada and the U.S. are recommending people start wearing masks again with a 'perfect storm' of respiratory diseases on the rise, a strain on our hospital systems and a shortage of medication. But is that enough to get us to wear masks again? Dr. Susy Hota joins About That with Andrew Chang to take us through it all.If a child is breathing very quickly, having trouble breathing, weak, doesn't wake up or respond then those might indicate a more severe bout. "Call 911 or go to the nearest emergency department," Allen said.The Public Health Agency of Canada reports fewer than five influenza-associated deaths among those aged 16 and younger for the week ending Nov. 19."Each year the number of deaths generally are in single digits," for that age group in Canada, Allen said.Doctor's holiday flu forecastMarie Tarrant, a professor in the nursing school at the University of British Columbia Okanagan, is concerned about the uptick in hospitalizations from flu for patients and health-care systems trying to provide care to everybody."The other side of that is just the burden that is putting on a healthcare system that has been maximally strained for the last 2 ½ years."A lab technician works in the H1N1 laboratory at the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control in Vancouver in 2009. This year's flu season started earlier than the norm. (Darryl Dyck/The Canadian Press)People with flu, RSV and other infections have a "compounding effect" of burdening hospitals, she said. Like Canada's National Advisory Committee on Immunization, Tarrant recommends those aged six months and older who are eligible get a flu shot."Flu vaccines prevent about 40 to 60 per cent of serious illness and hospitalization," she said. "They do work."It's also not too late to get a flu shot, clinicians say.Plus, flu season started earlier than it typically does this year, which could (eventually) offer a yuletide bright spot.

[+] Qatar in the 2022 World Cup, is dealing with a flu outbreak. (Photo by ADRIAN DENNIS/AFP via Getty Images)AFP via Getty Images The Netherlands football team has been facing a nasty opponent leading up to their round-of-16 matchup against the U.S. men’s national team (USMNT) this Saturday at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. This nasty opponent is very small, much smaller than a soccer ball. But it could have big consequences for the favored Dutch side or rather against the favored Dutch side. According to the Dutch team’s manager Louis van Gaal, several of his 26 players have been dealing with flu symptoms, although he wouldn’t specify how many players. Reporting for ESPN, Tom Hamilton quoted van Gaal as saying the following about the influenza virus, “If it goes around in the group, it is worrying.” Yeah, “worrying” is not a great word for the Dutch team before their winner-advances-and-loser-goes-home match versus the USMNT, scheduled to begin at 10 am U.S. Eastern Time on December 3. December 3 happens to be Let’s Hug Day too. But hugging isn’t a great thing to do when you have the flu. In fact, it’s better to keep people apart in general when the flu is spreading like an Elon Musk tweet. Therefore, rather than go through their usual 11-vs-11 practice two days prior to the match, the Netherlands just kept to a rather light practice. Aside from midfielders Frenkie de Jong and Marten de Roon mentioning a scratchy throat and upper respiratory symptoms, respectively, earlier this week, the team hasn’t revealed who specifically has been sick or how sick they’ve been. So it’s unclear how many Dutch players the flu will knockout from their knockout game against the U.S. The USMNT reached the knock-out stage of the World Cup by finishing second in Group B, after a 1-0 victory over Iran and ties against Wales and England. This has certainly been a better World Cup for the USMNT than the 2018 World Cup in Russia. The USMNT failed to qualify for that World Cup and hasn’t won a knockout stage match since 2002. But this year’s team has been impressive, especially considering the fact that many people in U.S. still think of football as the sport where a player wear a helmet and shoulder pads and doesn’t really use his or her foot on the ball that often. In the U.S., football is known as soccer, which rhymes with shocker and Kid Rock, er, as in what did “er, what did Kid Rock just say?” The Netherlands failed to qualify for the 2018 World Cup as well, which was a bit of a shocker. Unlike the USMNT, the Dutch side has historically been among the favorites to win the World Cup each time they’ve made it to the biggest of the big football tournaments over the past several decades. They’ve been a bit like the football version of Glenn Close, who’s been nominated for eight Oscars without winning a single one. Many consider the Dutch to be the most successful national team to never bring home the World Cup trophy. They’ve appeared in three World Cup finals, the latest being the 2010 World Cup in South Africa where they lost 1-0 to Spain in the championship match. In the current World Cup, the Dutch team finished atop Group A, following wins over Qatar and Ecuador and a draw against Senegal.

(Photo by John Todd/ISI Photos/Getty Images)Getty Images MORE FROMFORBES ADVISORBest Travel Insurance CompaniesByAmy DaniseEditorBest Covid-19 Travel Insurance PlansByAmy DaniseEditor Although the Netherlands side are favored to beat the USMNT, “flu” knows what’s going to happen. Having the flu is not fun, unless you enjoy being kicked in the proverbial balls with symptoms that can be quite debilitating. The flu virus typically doesn’t affect your actual balls. Instead, the most common symptoms are a fever, coughing, sneezing, body aches, chills, headaches, lack of energy, a runny nose, nausea, and vomiting. These symptoms can really “soccer” it to you, leaving you with that just-want-to-lie-in-bed-and-watch-Ted-Lasso-on-Netflix feeling and tend to appear with a few days of catching the virus. Typically symptoms last from four to seven days, although some symptoms such as a cough and feeling run down could persist for weeks. In some cases, the flu can land you in the hospital or even kill you, especially if you are a young child, older adult, or otherwise have a weaker immune system. Most healthy young adults do end up surviving the flu but every now and then you hear of a health young adult tragically passing away from the flu. So it’s important to take the flu seriously. It’s not just a cold. That’s why it’s a good idea to get the flu vaccine each year. The vaccine has a very good safety record and doesn’t turn you into a 5G transmitter, a refrigerator door, a “homoborgenesis”, or whatever anti-vaccination propaganda may try to make you believe. It’s also a good idea to keep washing your hands thoroughly and frequently because you tend to touch yourself, a lot. Each time you wash your hands, don’t just wave at the running faucet with jazz hands. Instead, make sure that you lather up with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds, which is about how long it takes to sing to the first chorus of the Divinyls song, “I Touch Myself.” Keep surfaces and high-touch objects like your gigantic statue of Portugal football star Cristiano Ronaldo regularly disinfected. If someone else has flu-like symptoms, try to stay at least six feet away, which is one Lewandowski since Polish football star Robert Lewandowski is about six feet tall.Cristiano Ronaldo #7 of Portugal jumps to head the ball during the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 Group H ...

But these days it may seem difficult to mention the words “face mask” without someone throwing another “f” word in your face, right? After all, some politicians, personalities, and anonymous social media accounts have politicized the “f” out of face masks during the Covid-19 pandemic. The Netherlands hasn’t been the only football team to struggle with such flu-ish symptoms at the ongoing World Cup in Qatar. The Brazilian team seems to have struggled with such symptoms in the group stage as well. Following Brazil’s 1-0 victory over Switzerland, one of their players, Antony, blamed the air conditioning system inside Qatar’s World Cup stadiums after he and others were left filling sick, according to Omar Garrick reporting for The Athletic. Now, air conditioning symptoms alone aren’t going to give you the flu. So don’t start looking at your air conditioner suspiciously. You have to either inhale the influenza virus or rub the virus into your eyes, nose, or mouth. Regardless, it looks like the World Cup may have gone viral, but not in a good way.

(Scott Olson/Getty Images) When the leaves start changing colors and there’s a cold breeze in the air, we begin to think of fall and spending time with friends and family as the holiday season nears. What we don’t have on our minds is the beginning of the respiratory illness season, such as influenza, and the importance of getting your annual flu vaccine. This is important because we will be spending time with people that are at high-risk of developing complications from respiratory infections, especially in people 65 years and older. Nationally, flu vaccination rates among people 65 years and older are not where they need to be to prevent serious illness and hospitalization. Currently, only 45.6% of people 65 years and older are vaccinated against influenza. This is well below the HealthPeople 2030 goal of 70%. This is important because older adults are at the greatest risk for flu-related complications, hospitalizations and death. It’s estimated that approximately 50% of flu-related hospitalizations and approximately 80% of flu-related deaths occurred in people 65 years and older in recent years. These complications and risks are due in part to the waning immune system that occurs with age, commonly known as immunosenescence. This decline of the immune system makes older adults more prone to infections but also a diminished response to vaccination. That is why the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended an enhanced influenza vaccine for people 65 and older. There are three enhanced flu vaccines available, high-dose, recombinant and adjuvanted. These vaccines are specially designed to boost the waning immune system and optimize protection against influenza infection. Is there an advantage of one over the other? There is no advantage of receiving one over the other — either of the three vaccines are effective at protecting against influenza, minimizing doctor and hospital visits and preventing serious complications from an infection. The benefits of the flu vaccine go far beyond protecting against severe influenza illness. The flu vaccine also provides protection against heart attacks and strokes that may occur in those with existing cardiovascular disease. An influenza infection increases the risk of heart attack up to 3 times in those that are unvaccinated. Studies have demonstrated the benefit of influenza vaccines at preventing a heart attack is similar to that of smoking cessation, certain cholesterol lowering medications and proper blood pressure control. For this reason, your annual flu vaccine should be a routine preventive measure to dramatically reduce your risk from these complications. Make sure you talk to your health care provider or pharmacist about which vaccine is right for you. And remember, the annual flu vaccine is a routine way to prevent flu-related complications, hospitalizations and death, allowing you to spend this, and every future holiday season with friends and family.

Photograph: Carolyn Kaster/APUS news This article is more than 1 year oldUS sees surge in children under five hospitalized for respiratory virusesThis article is more than 1 year oldWave of illness caused by RSV, influenza and other infections has seen more than three-quarters of pediatric hospital beds fullMelody SchreiberThu 1 Dec 2022 10.00 GMTLast modified on Fri 2 Dec 2022 22.41 GMTShareWhen his son was born seven weeks early, weighing only 2.5lb, RH watched as the little boy stayed in the neonatal intensive care unit for 37 days.When they finally left the hospital, RH, who asked to use his initials for health privacy, breathed a sigh of relief. The baby, despite his difficult start, was perfectly healthy. But only a few months later, the child landed back in the hospital with a dangerous virus, RSV.Fauci urges Americans to get Covid shot, as study finds new booster is best yetRead more“It’s terrifying,” he said. His tiny son was hooked up to a maze of wires and beeping monitors, including oxygen to help with his breathing and intravenous fluids for dehydration. He stayed there for a week.Hospitalizations for respiratory viruses like RSV, influenza and others are surging across the United States, with children under five – especially newborns and premature babies – at the most risk, while simultaneous shortages of antivirals and antibiotics have swept the nation.RSV hospitalization rates for newborns are seven times higher than they were in 2018, the last full season before the pandemic struck, and flu hospitalizations are the worst they have been in a decade. Rhinovirus, enterovirus, adenovirus, metapneumovirus and parainfluenza are also contributing to this wave of illness, and Covid cases are beginning to rise once again in the US.More than three-quarters of pediatric hospital beds were already full by mid-November. One hospital in Oregon has instituted pediatric crisis of care standards, an emergency measure to stretch existing capacity. Hospitals in California and Maryland began using overflow tents to try to address the swell in pediatric patients. Children’s hospitals in Boston and Salt Lake City have canceled planned surgeries.At least three children have died from RSV and 12 children have died from the flu so far this year, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).Leading child health organizations are calling for the Biden administration to declare a national emergency, as some 55 million Americans return from Thanksgiving holiday travel and many prepare for Christmas and New Year celebrations.FDA authorizes Covid vaccine boosters for children five and aboveRead more“I think it should have been called a national emergency a month ago,” said Anita K Patel, a pediatric critical care specialist at Children’s National hospital in Washington, DC, and an assistant professor of pediatrics at George Washington School of Medicine and Health Sciences.Children’s National has been operating at or near capacity for the past two months amid an “enormous spike” in RSV and flu cases, as well as other viruses, she said.“It’s like a viral petri dish right now,” said Mark Kline, physician-in-chief and chief medical officer at Children’s hospital, New Orleans. He has seen a “deluge” of children needing hospitalization for viral respiratory diseases over the past four to six weeks.The curves for new cases and hospitalizations are “almost vertical”, Kline said. “You’re at wintertime peak levels in the first half of November.” His hospital system is seeing double the number of patients usually seen at this time of year, and the flu positivity rates, for instance, have been “extremely high” at 30 to 35%.Respiratory viruses like flu and RSV typically spike in the winter – but not this early, often not simultaneously, and not at this scale. “What’s unique about this year is the sheer volume of cases,” Patel said.Most kids at this point have had Covid, so that could have, unfortunately, also weakened their immune systemsAnita K PatelAnother challenge has been the number of different viruses circulating at once. “Any one of them individually would have strained the system, but we’re dealing with at least four simultaneously,” Kline said. Pediatricians and primary care practices are also swamped.The child health crisis has had ripple effects across American society. Some schools have closed or temporarily switched to virtual learning as staff and students fall ill. And the surge in even mild illness has taken a toll on parents. In October, more than 100,000 people missed work because of childcare issues – a greater number than any other point in recent years, including 2020.RH’s son caught Covid in August, and his pediatrician warned that he might get sicker than usual in the next few weeks as he recovered. A friend had also warned him that RSV hits newborns and premature babies especially hard. When the baby came down with the sniffles a few weeks later, RH and his wife kept a close eye on him. After a few days, he seemed to be getting sicker, more lethargic. Then he vomited, and his breaths were labored.“It’s just that spidey sense you get where you’re like, something’s wrong,” RH said.His worries were confirmed. After a few hours of waiting in the emergency department, the medical team agreed that it looked like the baby was suffering from a severe case of RSV and should be admitted for care. That hospital was full of pediatric patients, though. They had to be transferred by ambulance to another hospital about 45 minutes away from their home.“It turned out to be the last bed that they had,” RH said. He felt lucky that he had listened to his instincts, and that he hadn’t waited.The causes for this wave in illness are complex and still being understood.View image in fullscreenMark Kline, physician-in-chief and chief medical officer at Children’s hospital, New Orleans advises keeping kids at home if they are sick. Photograph: Myrleen Pearson/AlamyOne term, “immunity debt”, has arisen during the pandemic, tough it’s not a scientific or medical term, and definitions can be confusingly opposed.Some proposed that precautions from Covid would lead to weakened immune systems for children – similar to the hygiene hypothesis, the discredited idea that getting sick is good for building the immune system. The idea that taking precautions weakens the immune system is a “total junk hypothesis”, Patel said.Another interpretation is that Covid itself has weakened immune systems, making other infections more severe. But there is no indication of permanent damage to immune systems, as there can be with viruses like HIV. “I haven’t seen any evidence of that,” Kline said.Several viral infections, including measles, are capable of temporarily suppressing immune responses, and more research on possible complications after Covid need to be done, experts said. Some immunological dysfunction may persist for months after mild or moderate Covid infections, one study found. Another recent study found that babies seemed to have worse bouts with RSV soon after a Covid infection.“We see that Covid affects every single organ system in your body,” Patel said. “Most kids at this point have had Covid, so that could have, unfortunately, also weakened their immune systems. But it’s too early to tell.”It is also possible that a more severe variant of RSV is circulating in some communities.But it could just be the vast numbers of infections causing the strain.The pediatric surge has been compared to the March 2020 Covid crisis that threatened to incapacitate hospitals. And it is happening on top of an existing healthcare crisis, with years of health worker shortages, illnesses and burnout.Yet some of these dangerous viruses are preventable by vaccination, and all of them could be dampened by measures like improving air quality and wearing masks.View image in fullscreenKindergarten students wearing face shields and masks at the Resurrection Catholic school in Los Angeles, California. Photograph: Étienne Laurent/EPAThe International Epidemiological Association called last week for global child vaccinations against Covid-19 amid staggeringly low vaccine rates for kids. The flu vaccine has also had low uptake.While there is no vaccine for RSV, there are monoclonal antibodies that are extremely effective at preventing hospitalization from RSV for at-risk infants, including premature babies – but many parents still don’t know about it, and getting approval from insurance companies can take time.The children most vulnerable to the worst outcomes are also too young to get vaccinated against the flu and Covid, and they are too young to wear masks.That means other precautions need to be taken as well by everyone around them.Masks, for instance, have proven effective at preventing respiratory viruses. “Masks will help prevent transmission of these other respiratory viruses the same way that masks prevent transmission of Covid-19,” Kline said.Schools and daycare centers should also invest in better ventilation and air filtration to remove many pathogens – including respiratory viruses and allergens – from the air, he said.And staying home when you’re sick is one of the most effective ways to cut down on further transmission. Even illnesses that seem mild in older kids and adults can be devastating for young children.“If your child is sick, please don’t send them to school, please don’t take them to family gatherings,” Kline said. “Keep them home.”After a week in the hospital, RH’s son had dramatically improved, though he still had a lingering cough a few weeks later. He has already been vaccinated against the flu, and next he is getting his Covid vaccine.RH is now on a mission to let other parents know about how dangerous these viruses can be for children. He took a fact sheet on bronchial diseases that a doctor gave him and “just blasted that out to everyone I knew who has a kid under two or is pregnant”, he said. “I had to be like, ‘Read this.’”RH urges families to be cautious this holiday season, keeping gatherings small, taking precautions, and avoiding travel.Even when you’re able to access care, watching your child fight against illness in a hospital bed is agonizing, RH said. “Any hospital stay is going to be pretty traumatic – mentally, physically, financially. So take that all into account when making your holiday decisions.”Explore more on these topicsUS newsChildren's healthHealthChildrenVaccines and immunisationCoronavirusInfectious diseasesnewsShareReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this storyDigested week: my child’s flu has plunged us into a full Ayckbourn farce9 Dec 2022Race to control ‘tripledemic’ as cases of RSV in children sweep US and Europe9 Dec 2022Flu and other viruses pile pressure on NHS as waiting lists hit new high8 Dec 2022Health experts in conundrum over best way to avoid winter ‘tripledemic’ 7 Dec 2022Germany faces ‘catastrophic’ paediatric bed shortage as RSV cases soar1 Dec 2022Plea to vaccinate children against flu as hospitalisations rise in England28 Oct 2022Immune system-evading hybrid virus observed for first time 24 Oct 2022It’s not just Covid: the triple threat that could overwhelm the NHS this winter7 Sept 2022…… commentsMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveTax strategyFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInXNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Total turkey production for Christmas was around 8.5 to 9 million birds, but around a million had been culled or died from bird flu.Giving evidence to the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs select committee avian influenza inquiry, Griffiths said it was uncertain how prices would be affected: “That’s really a question for the retailers. We don’t know how the gaps within retail are going to be filled at this point.”ALSO READ: VIDEOS: EuroTier poultry seminars available to watch Three top-notch seminars featuring 11 renowned speakers were organised by Poultry World during the EuroTier livestock exhibition and trade show in Hannover.

Read more…Turkey production brought indoorsGriffiths said that in the short term, he questioned whether outdoor free-range production would be viable given the scale of the avian influenza epidemic: “There may be a drop away from free-range production more towards indoor rearing.”Essex turkey farmer Paul Kelly said the spread of the outbreak had been devastating: “We have one farm with 9,500 turkeys. The first infection was on Thursday evening, and by Monday lunchtime, they were all dead. That is £700,000 gone.Kelly said he was unsure about how he’d rear his free-range birds next year given the ongoing avian influenza epidemic: “Luckily, we’re going to get through to next year, but… can we take the risk to grow Christmas poultry based on what we’ve seen this year? We couldn’t. And had I known what I know now, we would not have grown the turkeys we did.Culling and freezing“Looking to next year, I don’t want to put the farm at risk. Without a vaccine in place or a compensation scheme that is fit for purpose, I don’t know whether we’d have the confidence to grow Christmas poultry next year.”Some turkey producers have taken the government’s offer of culling birds early and freezing them for the Christmas market to prevent losses to bird flu. Others are trying to get into the scheme. Philip Hunter, who runs 6,000 birds at Suffolk Turkeys, including chickens and geese, wants to cull his birds in the next few days following a case of bird flu on his doorstep.But Hunter said he had received little communication from the Animal and Health Plant Agency. He told BBC Farming Today that he was still awaiting a vet to come on farm to assess that the birds were healthy: “Its very poor communication coming back to us.

(photo credit: REUTERS/PETER NICHOLLS) A 38-year-old woman from Qinzhou in southeastern China died after being infected with the H5N1 strain of avian influenza, the first death due to the strain in China since 2015, Hong Kong's Center for Health Protection announced on Wednesday.The woman developed symptoms on September 22 and passed away on October 18.Largest ever bird flu outbreak continues to spreadThe case comes as the largest ever recorded avian influenza outbreak continues to spread across the world, mainly in Europe and North America. The predominant strain in the outbreaks in Europe and North America is H5N1, although from the Eurasian lineage and not the Asian lineage which has been associated with severe or fatal human infections. So far, human infections by the Eurasian lineage have resulted only in mild illness. A preliminary risk assessment published by the UK Health Security Agency on Tuesday stated that due to the high amount of infected birds, humans were more likely to be exposed to the virus.

(credit: MICHAEL GILADI/FLASH90)The UKHSA added that available surveillance data does not suggest that the virus had adapted to spread widely in mammals and that there is no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission.The agency noted that sequencing from mammalian infections found that the virus they were infected with was carrying the PB2 E627K substitution, which is known to be acquired rapidly after infection of a mammalian host in some influenza viruses. The assessment added that the appearance of the mutation could indicate that the virus has a tendency to cause human infections. A recent report from the World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH) stated that over 4.6 million birds had died or were culled due to the virus in just a four week period between October 12 to November 10. Over 52.7 million domesticated birds in 46 states have been killed or culled in the US due to the 2022 avian influenza outbreak, making it the largest ever bird flu outbreak recorded in the US.Two outbreaks of H5N1 bird flu have been detected in Israel in the past few weeks, including one outbreak among turkeys in Kibbutz Shluhot in northern Israel and another at a turkey farm in Beit Herut in central Israel.Sign up for the Health & Wellness newsletter >> Related Tags flu animals Virus bird flu Hot Opinion Dear Jared Kushner, the Jewish people need you By JPOST EDITORIAL To recover, Democrats must expel anti-Zionist extremists who put off Middle America By AMOTZ ASA-EL Leaders of the Jewish enemies have always died as weak cowards By URI PILICHOWSKI How will the recent US election affect Iran, Russia, and North Korea?

If you haven't subscribed, you can do that by clicking here.Infectious disease experts say having one virus like a common cold could keep others at bay, as each bug effectively takes turns over the fall and winter.Respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, infections are stabilizing across the country and flu is picking up sharply, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada. Canadians are mingling and travelling freely again. The mixing of people with each other gives scientists a rare opportunity to watch how the different respiratory pathogens we carry interact after a pandemic.Until now, most virus research has focused on just a single pathogen at a time, whether in an individual patient or a whole population.Here's a look at the early science into why we likely won't see multiple viruses hitting adults at the same time — and who may be more vulnerable to a double- or triple-whammy.Multiple viruses may not hit adults at the same time but kids could face a double-whammy or worse. Scientists are exploring how and when viruses interfere with one another. (BSIP/UIG/Getty)Virus triggers immune defenceThough the idea of viruses interfering with one another has been discussed since the 1960s, the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic gave scientists some further clues about it.Dr. Guy Boivin, a virologist and professor of pediatrics at Laval University in Quebec City, wrote a commentary earlier this year reviewing the evidence on viral interference — competition between respiratory viruses interfering or blocking each other's spread."It was notable that the [H1N1 flu] pandemic virus emerged in France two to three months after its emergence in the other European countries," Boivin said. "That was related to a rhinovirus outbreak at that time. This small epidemic of rhinoviruses delayed the pandemic H1N1 virus in France."Rhinovirus is a type of a common cold virus.When it comes to waves of different respiratory infections like COVID, RSV and flu circulating in Canada, Boivin said he expects some overlap. But he also thinks it's unlikely they will all peak at the same time, because catching one bug can offer short-term protection against other viruses.WATCH | Renewed respiratory virus precautions: What would it take to get us to wear masks again? | About That2 years agoDuration 23:16Health experts in Canada and the U.S. are recommending people start wearing masks again with a 'perfect storm' of respiratory diseases on the rise, a strain on our hospital systems and a shortage of medication. But is that enough to get us to wear masks again? Dr. Susy Hota joins About That with Andrew Chang to take us through it all.Dr. Ellen Foxman, an immunologist at the Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Conn., studies antiviral defences at her lab, including how viral interference happens."Having one virus activates antiviral defences in your body," Foxman said. "That can protect against other viruses too, at least for a short span of time."Foxman said it's possible that having one infection makes you less likely to get another at the same time. For instance, if human airway tissues are infected with rhinovirus and then the H1N1 flu is introduced a few days later, the influenza virus won't grow.7 cold virus and flu myths and questions debunked"It was because the defences that the tissue turned on in response to the rhinovirus also protected against the flu," Foxman said.She's currently looking at interference between the virus that causes COVID-19 and other viruses in human airway samples at her lab.A view of the Bichat Hospital where the French Health ministry said a patient was treated for a confirmed case of H1N1 pandemic flu in May 2009. Scientists say another virus seemed to suppress H1N1 initially in France. (Benoit Tessier/Reuters)Short-lived protectionFoxman said the lining of our airways take on an antiviral defensive state when they sense an invader.The guard defence is one of several layers of protection in the immune system. One is called interferon: a family of proteins produced by the body's immune system in response to an invading viral infection.As the name implies, interferon interferes with or blocks the ability of a virus to accomplish its raison d'être of making copies of itself.Instead, interferon summons immune cells to the site of the invasion so they can take up arms against the threat.But interferon doesn't stay turned on for long, cautioned Dr. Allison McGeer, an infectious diseases specialist at Sinai Health System in Toronto."It's not an effect with most viruses and it's not a big effect," McGeer said.Dr. Allison McGeer, an infectious diseases specialist at Sinai Health System in Toronto, says the effect of viral interference is small. (Evan Mitsui/CBC)The opposite can also happen. Some people get double or co-infections — two or more bugs at the same time.Why that's the case isn't well understood and the degree to which it happens is just starting to be explored. McGeer said co-infections happen "not infrequently" among kids admitted to the hospital.Baby's multiple infections at onceEmilie Doré's six-week-old son, Diego, was one of them. "My mom instincts were telling me that it was a bad cold on a baby who is just too little, too young," Doré recalled.Baby Diego was hospitalized at Montreal Children's Hospital for four days with multiple respiratory infections. (Submitted by Emilie Doré)Doré was on the lookout for symptoms in the infant after her two-year-old daughter fell sick. First the baby had a little congestion and a cough followed by lethargy and fever."I would say the most upsetting and worrying time was when he had to be connected to oxygen because he was having difficulty breathing," the Montreal mother said.When he wasn't getting better, Diego had a lumbar puncture or spinal tap procedure. The tests suggested he had RSV, rhinovirus and enterovirus, another common cold virus, as well as possibly meningitis.He recovered after four days in hospital and is now eight weeks old.Baby Diego has now recovered. (Submitted by Emilie Dore)Virologists say at a population level, other factors, such as human behaviour of different age groups, population immunity, environmental conditions like temperature and humidity and what's happened during the COVID-19 pandemic also influence the triple threat of viral spread.Separate waves of each virus may still sicken individuals and increase demand on emergency departments and primary care services at a time they're struggling with staffing shortages and backlogs.Young and old more likely to face severe flu. Here's why doctors think it happensWhat to know about RSV, a virus surging among young children in CanadaDr. Gerald Evans, chair of infectious diseases at Queen's University and Kingston Health Sciences Centre, said when people in hospital are tested for respiratory infections now, three viruses can appear."We are starting to pick up a small signal that people can get infected with both flu and with COVID, and certainly in children we see flu and RSV popping up," Evans said."So the impact of that coinfection we're still going to have to figure out. We are seeing it. It's small numbers."ABOUT THE AUTHORAmina ZafarJournalistAmina Zafar covers medical sciences and health care for CBC.

Through a paper published in the European Journal of Heart Failure, researchers assessed the impact of how 5,210 adults with heart failure responded to a regular or high-dose flu vaccine, which is provided to adults ages 65 and older. More than one-third of adults, almost 38%, experienced side effects, like having a sore arm or feeling tired. These minor symptoms foreshadowed vaccine effectiveness. Compared to adults with heart failure who didn’t report side effects, those who did were less likely to be hospitalized for any cause or die prematurely. One exception was adults who experienced side effects that were severe, which affected 2.9% of study participants and were associated with an increased risk for hospitalization or death. In a letter published in JAMA Network Open, researchers echoed similar findings about COVID-19 vaccines. After partnering with 928 middle-aged to older adults from the Framingham Heart Study who received a Moderna or Pfizer vaccine, researchers found six in 10 study participants experienced mild to moderate symptoms. Common examples included having a fever, chills, muscle soreness, or feeling tired. However, regardless of symptom onset, nearly all adults had increased antibody production – a sign the vaccines were working. Some adults, like women and people with prior COVID-19 infections, were more likely to report side effects. While more research is needed to understand these differences, the authors underscored that common side effects signal the immune system is responding. They also conclude the findings support ongoing recommendations for COVID-19 booster shots in older adults.

Her research focuses on microbiology, molecular biology, and hematology. Dr. Bae is currently working toward implementing a global clinical study and establishing an international network of clinical investigations. What should we expect during this year’s flu season?Eunsin Bae, M.D.Image source: Seegene Dr Bae: 'Over the past three years, we have been paying particular attention to personal hygiene such as frequent hand washing and the use of face masks. Due to reduced exposure and lowered immunity to respiratory viruses including influenza and colds during the pandemic, we have become more vulnerable to such illnesses. The UK Health Security Agency says that emergency department attendances for acute respiratory infections and influenza-like illness have increased. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, early increases in seasonal influenza activity have been reported in most of the United States. South Korea has also seen a surge in influenza cases outside of their expected season. In addition, South Korea and the United States are both witnessing the early and fast spread of respiratory syncytial virus which usually causes mild, cold-like symptoms but can sometimes cause serious complications especially in very young infants and older adults. Health officials are especially concerned about the early return of influenza in Australia this year. The intensity of the flu season in Europe and North America can often be predicted by the flu season in the southern hemisphere. This year, Australia experienced its worst flu season in five years. At its height in June, more than 30,000 cases were reported each week. Australian Influenza Surveillance Report shows that the most prominent flu strain during their winter was influenza A (H3N2), which is more likely to lead to severe morbidity and increased mortality than influenza B or seasonal A (H1N1) strains.1 It is expected that the circulation of respiratory viruses could return to pre-pandemic levels spreading widely at the same time, fueling concerns of a potential winter “multi-demic”, which is why multiplex testing is more important than ever this year.' What is multiplex testing?'Multiplex testing in molecular tests refers to PCR tests that simultaneously detect multiple pathogens in a single reaction with one sample. While most singleplex PCR tests for respiratory infection only detect a single pathogen such as COVID-19 or Influenza A and B, multiplex PCR tests for respiratory infection can detect and differentiate COVID-19, influenza and respiratory syncytial virus using a single tube. However, some will extend beyond that to include adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, human rhinovirus and metapneumovirus.' About Seegene’s Allplex™ SARS-CoV-2/FluA/FluB/RSV Assay The Allplex™ SARS-CoV-2/FluA/FluB/RSV Assay detects six targets associated with the four respiratory viruses. For the detection of COVID-19, three distinct genes (S, RdRp, N) are included as targets to reliably identify positive cases, even as new variants emerge. The test also includes two internal controls for proper sampling and testing validation. The product can deliver results within two hours when extraction-free, making it both time and cost-efficient. The assay is CE-IVDD marked but is available for research use only in the U.S. Image source: Seegene What are the benefits of using multiplex testing?Clinicians and laboratories 'Multiplex PCR testing enables clinicians to make informed decisions for patient management, including the need for isolation and appropriate treatment. The ability to identify infectious pathogens using a single assay rather than multiple tests will allow laboratories to create an efficient workflow and conserve important testing materials that are in short supply. Multiplex testing can also identify coinfections. Research in 2020 found that people diagnosed with flu and COVID-19 at the same time had an increased risk of death compared to those who only tested positive for COVID-19.2 Based on a meta-analysis result, coinfection of COVID-19 and flu was associated with a higher risk of ICU admission compared with infections caused by COVID-19 only.3'Patients and health authorities 'Getting multiple results from a single test means less discomfort and lower costs for patients. Respiratory illnesses may present similar symptoms such as cough, sneezing, stuffy or runny nose, sore throat, and fever. Despite the similarities in symptoms and signs, there are preferred treatment options for each respiratory virus. Influenza B virus, for example, is highly resistant to amantadine and rimantadine, antiviral drugs that are used to treat Influenza A virus. Multiplex testing also helps early detection of outbreaks by screening multiple viruses in a single test, enabling rapid public health response to limit spread, particularly in hospitals and long-term care facilities.' Can we apply molecular diagnostics to other disease diagnosis areas?'Conventional laboratory tests for the detection of infectious pathogens are based on microbiological culture, which requires long incubation times, special facilities, and laboratory personnel highly trained in clinical microbiology. Furthermore, many bacteria and viruses require specific conditions for growth and are, therefore, difficult to culture. In this respect, rapid and highly accurate molecular diagnostic tests will be excellent alternatives for clinical microbiology laboratories. Other than respiratory illnesses, there is a demand for multiplex molecular diagnostic tests for infectious diseases such as gastrointestinal tract infections, sexually transmitted infections, human papillomavirus infections, meningitis, and urinary tract infections. High multiplex PCR tests covering these disease areas could offer speed and sensitivity that was impossible to achieve with standard microbiology and play a significant role in improving clinical care for patients.'

Wild birds, such as ducks, gulls, and shorebirds, can carry and spread these viruses but may show no signs of illness. However, avianinfluenza can kill wild birds and domestic poultry (such as chickens,turkeys, ducks, and geese).Avian influenza spreads quickly through direct, bird-to-bird contact. It can also spread to birds via contaminated surfaces and materials, including people’s clothing, shoes, or hands.According to the Illinois Department of Natural Resources (IDNR), more than 300 waterbirds, primarily snow geese, have died of suspected avian bird flu at public hunting areas in southern Illinois.The deceased wild birds have been found at Baldwin Lake, Pyramid State Recreation Area, Rend Lake, and Carlyle Lake in recent days.IDNR is asking the public to report large concentrations (20 or more) of deceased birds found at any location.IDNR and the Illinois Department of Agriculture first announced the detection of avian influenza in March 2022 when it was found in wild Canada geese.Illinois is not alone, Missouri has also seen recent cases of avian bird flu in waterfowl.“We have seen an uptick in avian flu in the last two weeks", said Sherri Russell, a wildlife veterinarian with the Missouri Department of Conservation (MDC). "We were expecting it. We’re seeing problems in Arkansas, Illinois and Missouri.”As the birds migrate south this fall and winter, cases in wild ducks and geese were anticipated.It’s something that organizations like MDC and IDNR are monitoring closely. Thankfully, avian influenza rarely infects people.“It specifically targets a receptor in birds that is unique to bird lungs," explained Lucas Kirschman, a biologist assistant professor at Southeast Missouri State University. "Mammals, especially humans, do not have that receptor except very deep in the lungs. Birds essentially get the flu the same way a person does, there’s respiratory symptoms.”This current strain of bird flu has proven to be very contagious. Waterfowl, like snow geese, are at high risk, not only because they're susceptible to the virus, but also because they often congregate in large groups, making transmission more likely.Domestic birds, mainly poultry, have also experienced outbreaks of avian bird flu."This strain is especially virulent to chickens and turkeys," said Kirschman. "Once it gets into a domesticated poultry flock, it spreads very rapidly and is almost universally fatal.”The public should avoid handling sick or dead waterfowl found in the field, and they should not allow dogs or other pets to consume waterfowl that died from unknown causes.

Viral infections commonly cause respiratory and digestive illnesses, but viruses can also infect most other parts of your body.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. PolicyWhat is a virus?A virus is a type of germ (pathogen) that’s so small, you can only see it under a microscope. All viruses carry a small piece of genetic information (DNA or RNA) inside a protective coating (capsid). You can think of it like an envelope carrying instructions. Our cells, on the other hand, are like an entire factory: They contain instructions and all the equipment needed to carry them out. These instructions tells us how to build proteins and make more cells.Unlike you and me, viruses don’t have cells, which means they don’t have all the “machinery” they need to make more of themselves. So, if they want to make copies of their instructions (replicate), they have to break into our cells and use our machinery to do it. Viruses replicating is what makes you sick with a viral infection.How do you tell if a disease is viral or bacterial?Viruses and bacteria can cause similar symptoms, like fever, cough and rashes. The only way to know what kind of infection you have is to have a healthcare provider assess you. If you have symptoms that last more than a few days or that concern you, see your provider.What are the types of viral infections?You might hear viruses described by what part of your body they infect, how they spread or what symptoms they cause. Some viruses, like herpes viruses and adenoviruses, can cause many different types of illness. Types of viral infections include:AdvertisementRespiratory infections.Digestive system infections.Viral hemorrhagic fevers.Sexually transmitted infections (STIs).Exanthematous (rash-causing) infections.Neurological infections.Congenital infections.Respiratory infectionsRespiratory infections affect your nose, throat, airways and lungs. Many respiratory viruses can cause bronchitis, sinusitis, ear infections or pneumonia. Examples include:Common cold (usually caused by rhinovirus).The flu (influenza).COVID-19.Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).Human metapneumovirus (hMPV).Parainfluenza.Viral infections in your digestive systemViral infections in your digestive system can affect your stomach and intestines (GI tract) or your liver. These include:Norovirus, rotavirus and astrovirus can cause gastroenteritis, sometimes called “stomach flu.”Hepatitis viruses cause liver disease. These infections often last a long time (chronic).Viral hemorrhagic feversHemorrhagic fevers affect how your blood clots and can weaken your blood vessels, causing potentially life-threatening bleeding. Examples include:Ebola.Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome.Severe dengue.Yellow fever.Sexually transmitted virusesSexually transmitted diseases are mainly spread by sexual contact, including oral, anal and vaginal sex. Examples include:Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).Human papilloma virus (HPV)/genital warts.Genital herpes (HSV).Hepatitis B.Exanthematous viral infectionsExanthematous viral infections cause rashes that can appear as bumps or blisters on your skin or spots of blood under your skin. They can also cause respiratory or other symptoms. Examples of exanthematous infections include:Chickenpox.Measles.Rubella (German measles).Roseola.Fifth disease.Mpox.Neurological infectionsSome viruses attack the cells of your nervous system (your brain and spinal cord). These can cause paralysis, swelling of your brain or its covering (encephalitis or meningitis) and other life-threatening conditions. Examples include:West Nile virus.Polio.Rabies.Congenital viral infectionsCongenital viral infections are those you’re born with. They pass from a pregnant person to the fetus while it’s developing or during birth. Depending on the virus, this can cause various health issues, including vision or hearing loss, developmental delays and neurological conditions. Viruses known to cause congenital infections include:Cytomegalovirus (CMV).Rubella.Zika virus.Who do viral infections affect?All of us will get viral infections at some point. But you’re at increased risk of serious illness from certain types of viruses if you:Are under 5 or over 65.Have certain health conditions, like diabetes, asthma, COPD or other chronic lung disease.Have a weakened immune system (from HIV/AIDS, cancer or immunosuppressive medications).Are pregnant.AdvertisementSymptoms and CausesWhat are the symptoms of a viral infection?Symptoms of a viral infection depend on where you’re infected, but some common ones include:Flu-like symptoms: fever, head and body aches, fatigue.Upper respiratory symptoms: sore throat, cough, sneezing.Digestive symptoms: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea.Skin conditions: rashes, sores, blisters, warts.Many viral infections don’t cause any symptoms.What causes viral infections?Many different types of viruses can cause infections, though only a few infect humans. They can get into your body through your nose, mouth, eyes, anus or genitals, or through a break in your skin. Once there, they get inside of your cells and use them to make more copies of themselves.How do you get a viral infection?Common ways you can get viral infections include:From other people (through coughing, sneezing or close contact).From surfaces or objects that someone with a virus has touched (like countertops, doorknobs or phones).Through vaginal, oral or anal sex.From a bite from an infected animal, mosquito or tick.From eating contaminated food or swallowing contaminated water.Are viral infections contagious?Yes, nearly all viral infections are contagious (can spread from person to person). Viruses need to infect living things to reproduce, so human viruses survive by spreading between people.Diagnosis and TestsHow are viral infections diagnosed?A healthcare provider can often diagnose you with a viral infection by listening to your symptoms and examining you. To diagnose a specific virus, your provider might swab your nose or throat or take a blood sample for testing.AdvertisementIf they think you have a viral infection causing serious inflammation in your lungs, brain or another internal organ, your provider might get X-rays, ultrasound, MRI or CT imaging. Imaging can’t diagnose a viral infection, but it can help your provider understand how it’s affecting your body.Tests for viral infectionsYour provider might send body fluid or tissue samples to a lab to look for signs of a viral infection (viral DNA/RNA, antibodies or antigens). Types of samples they might take include:Blood.Spit (saliva).Phlegm or mucus (sputum).Cells from your nose or nasopharynx (nasalasopharyngeal swab).Skin or other affected tissue.Fluid around your brain and spinal cord (CNS fluid).Pee (urine).Poop (stool).Cells from your cervix (Pap smear). Pap smears can find HPV, a virus that can cause cancer. The kind of HPV that can lead to cancer doesn’t usually have symptoms.Management and TreatmentHow are viral infections treated?Specific medications are only available for a few viral infections. For viruses that can cause life-threatening or chronic illness, a provider may prescribe antiviral medications or treatment that prevents you from getting sick after being exposed to a virus.For infections that rarely cause serious illness, like the common cold, you can usually treat the symptoms at home while you wait for them to go away on their own.AdvertisementWhat medications are used to treat viruses?Medications a healthcare provider might prescribe to treat viral infections include antiviral medications, convalescent plasma and post-exposure prophylaxis.Antiviral medicationsAntiviral medications stop viruses from making more copies of themselves (replicating). They can be used to manage chronic infections or shorten the length of some respiratory infections. They can only treat one type of virus — they don’t work on other viruses. Antivirals are available for the flu, COVID-19, hepatitis B and C, HIV and mpox.Convalescent plasmaIn some cases, providers can treat someone with a life-threatening viral infection with a blood transfusion. For convalescent plasma treatment, someone who has recovered from an infection with the same virus donates their blood. Your provider gives you the plasma from the blood through an IV. The plasma contains antibodies, which help you fight the infection. Providers have treated some cases of COVID-19 and Ebola with convalescent plasma.Post-exposure prophylaxisTreatments for certain life-threatening viral infections can prevent you from getting sick after being exposed. A provider has to give you these treatments before you have symptoms. These include antiviral medications and immunoglobulin (antibody) treatment. Post-exposure prophylaxis is available for:HIV.Rabies.Hepatitis B.Chickenpox.Do antibiotics work on a viral infection?No, antibiotics can’t treat or cure illnesses caused by a virus. You provider will only give you antibiotics if they think you have a bacterial infection.How do I manage my symptoms?If you have a mild respiratory or GI tract infection without complications, you can often manage the symptoms at home. Using over-the-counter (OTC) medications, drinking plenty of fluids and getting enough rest can help get you through until you’ve fought off the virus. It’s always a good idea to ask a healthcare provider what medications are OK to take.Care at Cleveland ClinicFind a Primary Care ProviderSchedule an AppointmentPreventionHow can I prevent viral infections?One of the best ways to reduce your risk of a viral illness is to get vaccinated. A healthcare provider can tell you which vaccinations are recommended for you. Vaccinations are available for:Chickenpox.COVID-19.Hepatitis A.Hepatitis B.Human papillomavirus (HPV).Flu (influenza).Measles, mumps and rubella.Polio.Rotavirus.Rabies.Shingles.Other ways to protect yourself and others from viruses include:Wash your hands frequently, especially during cold and flu season.Practice safe food habits. This includes storing food properly, heating meat and poultry to a safe temperature, and washing or peeling fruits and vegetables before eating.Use a condom or dental dam during any kind of sex.Protect yourself from bug bites. Wear protective clothing, use bug spray and sleep under mosquito netting if necessary.Don’t handle wild or aggressive animals. Don’t leave your pets outside unsupervised, where they could potentially get bitten by an animal with rabies.Avoid being around other people if you’re sick.Get post-exposure prophylaxis. If you’ve been exposed to certain viruses, post-exposure prophylaxis can prevent you from getting a life-threatening illness. Talk to a provider right away if you think you’ve been exposed to rabies, HIV, hepatitis B or chickenpox.Outlook / PrognosisWhat can I expect if I have a viral infection?What to expect depends on what kind of viral infection you have. You can usually manage less serious infections, like the common cold or skin infections, at home. Other viral infections can cause life-threatening or long-lasting illness.How long do viral infections last?Viral infections can vary a lot in how long they last, for instance:Respiratory infections can last a few days to two weeks.A wart on your skin can last for a year or longer.Hepatitis B and C can cause chronic infections that last for years.HIV infections aren’t curable and are lifelong.Complications of viral infectionsViral infections can cause serious complications, both shortly after getting sick or years later. Complications include:Inflammation in your lungs (pneumonia). Respiratory illnesses can infect your lungs and cause swelling that can make it hard to breathe. You may have to be treated in the hospital for severe pneumonia.Inflammation in your brain or its lining (encephalitis or meningitis). If a virus moves to your brain from another part of your body, it can cause swelling. This can be life-threatening.Severe bleeding. Hemorrhagic illnesses, like severe dengue, can cause life-threatening bleeding.Reactivation. Some viral infections can stay in your body for a long time, even if you no longer have symptoms — or you never had symptoms at all. A virus that’s not reproducing or causing symptoms in your body is called dormant. Viruses like Epstein-Barr (EBV), HPV, herpes simplex and varicella can reactivate in your body and cause symptoms years later.Cancer. Some viruses that stay in your body for long periods of time can cause cancer (oncoviruses). HPV, Epstein-Barr, HIV, hepatitis B and C, human T-lymphotropic virus 1 (HTLV-1) and human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) have all been linked to specific cancers.Living WithWhen should I see my healthcare provider?Contact a healthcare provider if:You have symptoms of a viral infection that aren’t getting better or are getting worse after several days.You have symptoms of the flu or COVID-19 and are at risk for serious illness. Your provider may be able to treat you with antiviral medications.You’ve been exposed to HIV, rabies, hepatitis B or chickenpox. You need post-exposure prophylaxis as soon as possible after exposure.When should I go to the ER?Go to the nearest ER or seek immediate medical attention if you have signs of a serious infection, including:High fever (103 degrees Fahrenheit/39.4 degrees Celsius).Difficulty breathing.Chest pain.Coughing up blood.Severe stomach (abdominal) pain.Confusion or other mental changes.What questions should I ask my doctor?How do I prevent spreading this to other people?How do I use my medication?How long will it take to feel better?What can I do to manage my symptoms at home?When should I follow up with you?A note from Cleveland ClinicViral infections are common and usually not serious. We manage colds, the occasional stomach bug, and bumps and sores on our skin on a regular basis. But some viruses cause life-threatening illnesses, and some common illnesses — like the flu — can turn serious. This is why it’s important to take steps to protect yourself and those around you from viral infection. Vaccinations, good hand-washing habits and safe sex can all help you stay healthy.Medically ReviewedLast reviewed on 11/23/2022.Learn more about the Health Library and our editorial process.ReferencesAdvertisementAdvertisementAdAppointments 216.444.6503Appointments & LocationsRequest an AppointmentRendered: Tue Nov 12 2024 01:11:40 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)FacebookTwitterYouTubeInstagramLinkedInPinterestSnapchatActionsAppointments & AccessAccepted InsuranceEvents CalendarFinancial AssistanceGive to Cleveland ClinicPay Your Bill OnlineRefer a PatientPhone DirectoryVirtual Second OpinionsVirtual VisitsBlog, News & AppsConsult QDHealth EssentialsNewsroomMyClevelandClinicMyChartAbout Cleveland Clinic100 Years of Cleveland ClinicAbout UsLocationsQuality & Patient SafetyOffice of Diversity & InclusionPatient ExperienceResearch & InnovationsCommunity CommitmentCareersFor EmployeesResources for Medical ProfessionalsSite Information & PoliciesSend Us FeedbackSite MapAbout this WebsiteCopyright, Reprint & LicensingWebsite Terms of UsePrivacy PolicyNotice of Privacy PracticesNon-Discrimination Notice9500 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio 44195 | 800.223.2273 | © 2024 Cleveland Clinic.

Apart from the deadly trail it has left behind, the pandemic has also had a major impact on societies across the world. The disease has destabilised governments and national economies and ushered in a wave of political upheaval. It has fuelled fascist politics, empowered populist right-wing politicians and opened space for radical right-wing groups to flex their muscles. But the world has also witnessed a wave of progressive activism and organising that has resisted this trend. The pandemic seems to be part of a series of challenges pushing millions of people to take radical approaches, in both progressive and totalitarian ways. It appears to be empowering more people to step up – people who want to stop the next pandemic, fight to curb climate change and defeat far-right forces. To students of history, it is hardly surprising that the pandemic has had this effect. Take, for example, the 1918-20 H1N1 influenza pandemic, also known as the Spanish flu outbreak. It killed between 50 million and 100 million people and sickened 500 million worldwide – a quarter of the world’s population. In a 2017 article, How the Horrific 1918 Flu Spread Across America, author John M Barry presciently argued “the most important lesson from 1918 is to tell the truth.” “To retain the public’s trust, authorities had to be candid,” so they can meet the crisis with “layers” of mitigation efforts, Barry wrote. Influenza victims crowd into an emergency hospital at Camp Funston, a subdivision of Fort Riley, Kansas, the US in 1918 [File:AP] But that was not what occurred during the flu outbreak a century ago and that is certainly not what has been happening with the COVID-19 pandemic. National governments and local communities then and now mostly did not take adequate measures to stem the spread of the contagion. Many leaders downplayed it as “ordinary influenza” or a “little flu” or just flat-out lied, creating an atmosphere of distrust and misinformation. As World War I raged on in 1918, millions of soldiers fell ill. Even after the war’s end, European measures to stop the spread of the virus were meagre or even nonexistent. In the United States, there was no coordinated national effort to combat the pandemic. Economic recession, riots, civil strife and the rise of far-right movements grew out of the pandemic and World War I. In the US, immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe, African Americans and Jews became scapegoats for the spread of H1N1 flu and for the loss of jobs. During the Red Summer of 1919 alone, white mobs attacked Black communities in more than two dozen cities across the US, beating, raping and killing Black residents and burning their homes and businesses. In Italy and Germany, fascist forces took advantage of the fallout of the pandemic and war-related recession to win public support. One study even correlated the death toll from the flu pandemic for different cities and regions in Germany from 1918 to 1920 with levels of support for the Nazi Party a decade later. Yet there was another side effect of the pandemic from a century ago. In the US, with the flu disproportionately killing young white men, more white women found themselves in the workforce in the 1920s, reversing a decades-long decline in the number of working women. This was a boost to first-wave feminism as it normalised women’s presence in workplaces. Some experts consider the frivolity of the Roaring Twenties itself an example of the left-leaning radicalisation of young people in response to a pandemic, recession, war and the violence of the era. This may have been particularly true for young intellectuals leading literary movements like the Harlem Renaissance and modernism. In the colonised world, the pandemic also had a major impact. In India, at least 12 million people died, mostly during the second wave of infections in 1918-19 while another 2.5 million people from a population of roughly 130 million died from the disease on the African continent. India’s and Africa’s British rulers, in particular, showed racist indifference to this overwhelming death toll, which came on top of the pervasive poverty and suffering under colonialism. There is not much more to learn about the pandemic from African archives beyond the death statistics because as author Nanjala Nyabola put it, nearly everything in these archives “is the perspective of colonial officials constructing a racist political state”. Small wonder that anti-colonial movements grew in strength and numbers in the years after the end of World War I and as the H1N1 pandemic abated. Today, one can easily draw parallels between the Spanish flu outbreak and the COVID-19 pandemic. In the past three years, the signs of fascist resurgence in the West have grown with the spread and mutation of COVID-19. In the US, the most obvious example is the insurrection on January 6, 2021, in Washington, in which several thousand protesters stormed the US Capitol building to stop Congress from certifying the 2020 presidential election win of President Joe Biden. In addition to former President Donald Trump’s role in inciting this violent attempt to overthrow the government, it was also apparent that restrictions put in place to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 – what the January 6 insurrectionists would call “government overreach” – played a role. In Italy, which had one of the deadliest early outbreaks in Europe, Giorgia Meloni and her Brothers of Italy party, which has fascist roots, won the election with a coalition of other far-right forces. In the Philippines, which also suffered from government mismanagement of the pandemic response, Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr, a member of the Marcos family, which presided over a brutal dictatorship in the 1980s, was elected president. For supporters of the far right, this form of “governmental overreach” is part of a theme that includes globalisation, climate change and immigration. All are examples of how the pandemic has made already existing trends towards totalitarianism and racist, xenophobic, misogynistic, homophobic and religious extremism normal, even alluring. But COVID-19 has also encouraged political action in the opposite direction. In the US, the strong voter turnout in the midterms for centre-left Democratic Party candidates for Congress like John Fetterman in Pennsylvania and Mandela Barnes of Wisconsin against fascist-leaning Republicans is one example. Another is the series of labour actions, including more than 50,000 higher education workers on strike in the University of California system and at New School University. Policemen pin down and arrest a protester during a demonstration on a street in Shanghai, China on November 27, 2022 [AP] In Iran, where there was much anger at the high death toll during the pandemic, mass protests were triggered by the death in police custody of Jina (Mahsa) Amini but evolved into resistance against government repression. In China, demonstrations erupted against the government’s zero COVID-19 policy, but also against the crackdown on the freedom of dissent and movement. There have also been widespread labour disruptions in commerce, public transportation, education, childcare, healthcare and other sectors in the UK, France, South Korea, Australia and South Africa among many other nations. But the COVID-19 pandemic has been different from past global outbreaks in how people have mobilised. The response over the past three years has been to shift organising efforts online and onto platforms like Twitter, Zoom, Facebook and Instagram. “Our ‘armchairs’ [from the disdainful refrain of ‘armchair activism’] have become the primary portals for our current sociopolitical movement,” social justice activist Anjali Enjeti wrote in her book Southbound. In-person activism and organising certainly did not go away with the COVID-19 pandemic. But those combined with online efforts and outrage over the failures of governments to tell the truth about the pandemic galvanised Zillennials and Gen Zers (people born between 1995 and 2012). In the US, they along with Black and Latinx voters, defeated regressive forces in the 2020 and 2022 elections. It remains to be seen whether this mobilisation will ultimately keep the US and other countries from falling into a civil war or send them ever closer toward disruption and destruction. Perhaps this depends on answering the questions that award-winning author Imani Perry asks at the end of her book South to America: “When will you finally be repulsed enough to throw a wrench in the works? When will you allow curiosity and integrity to tip over into urgency?” In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, on top of climate change and the rise of far-right forces in the US and globally, millions of people have already been dreaming of and doing much for a better world. This is because they are hurting. Because for them, getting into good and deadly trouble is the only choice.

The performance location was in North Carolina, with an appropriation type of defense working capital funds for fiscal 2015-2017. Frequently Asked Questions: What is GlaxoSmithKline? GlaxoSmithKline was formed in 2000 with the merger of Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham. Previously, the pharmaceutical giants were separate companies of Glaxo, Wellcome, SmithKline, and Beecham. Almost 22 years after the merger, the company ranks 294th on the Fortune 500 list in 2022. While its corporate headquarters is located in London, England, GSK has a significant presence in the United States with two corporate hubs, employing approximately 15,000 people. The company offers expanded nationwide access to its pharmaceutical products across commercial, research & development, manufacturing, and corporate functions. What is GlaxoSmithKline’s Sotrovimab? Sotrovimab is a neutralizing monoclonal antibody developed by GlaxoSmithKline and Vir Biotechnology. It serves as an early treatment against COVID-19 and prevents the virus from getting into the lungs to cause an infection. Sotrovimab acts like a clone of human antibodies, sticking to the spike protein of the virus to neutralize it. Once the treatment takes effect, it can prevent reinfection from COVID-19 for at least four weeks. Sotrovimab is branded under Xevudy in the United Kingdom. Does GSK’s Sotrovimab have FDA approval? The Food and Drug Administration issued Emergency Use Authorization (FDA EUA) for Sotrovimab on May 26, 2021. While still unapproved, FDA allowed the treatment use of the medicine for mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adults and pediatric patients at least 12 years old or 40 kgs. The FDA EUA applies only to positive cases where patients haven’t been hospitalized or require respiratory support. Does GlaxoSmithKline have a COVID-19 vaccine? Aside from offering Sotrovimab for COVID-19 treatment, GlaxoSmithKline provides the technology to improve the immune system’s response to the vaccine. GSK’s adjuvant technology increases the production of the vaccine, as it can develop large quantities of the vaccine with only a tiny amount. The company has offered this technology with Sanofi, Medicago, and SK bioscience. At the same time, GlaxoSmithKline has worked with CureVac to develop mRNA vaccines against multiple COVID-19 variants. The preclinical test results were announced in 2021, while the clinical trial commenced in 2022. The partnership aims to build five mRNA-based vaccines and monoclonal antibodies. Does GSK have an influenza vaccine? GlaxoSmithKline has been awarded different government contracts for influenza vaccine doses. In February 2022, The US Department of Health and Human Services’ Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority extended its agreement with GSK to provide influenza vaccine for the US government. Aside from the US government, GSK has contracts and agreements for the production of influenza supply doses in Europe, Canada, and the World Health Organization. The company has also developed different vaccine delivery methods for influenza, such as Afluria Quadrivalent, Fluarix Quadrivalent, FluLaval Quadrivalent, Fluzone Quadrivalent, and more. Getting ahead of diseases with science, technology, and talent GlaxoSmithKline government contracts have positively impacted the world’s fight against diseases. With its large scale and long history of expertise, GSK is on a mission to improve the health of 2.5 billion people worldwide in the next ten years.

A necropsy performed on the carcass at Université de Montréal’s Faculty of Veterinary Medicine reveals that the dolphin died of avian flu, an infectious disease that mainly affects birds. From the Gulf of Mexico to Sweden Although it mainly affects birds, avian influenza, or bird flu, can be transmitted to mammals. Cases of infected red foxes, lynx, otters and European polecats have also been reported in Europe. As for marine mammals, a few cases of infected seals have been documented. Recently, the first cases of affected cetaceans have surfaced. In March 2022, the death of a dolphin in the Gulf of Mexico was attributed to bird flu, which triggered inflammation of the brain. A few months later, i.e. last June, the first case of a porpoise to succumb to avian influenza was documented in Sweden. It is likely that this porpoise had come into contact with infected wild birds. Harbour seals affected by avian flu in the St. Lawrence. © QMMERN © Pierre Luc Pelletier Situation in Quebec In Quebec, many harbour seals have died after contracting H5N1, a seemingly highly pathogenic Eurasian strain of the avian flu that attempts to firmly establish itself in mammals. Last spring, a bear and her two cubs contracted this strain at Forillon National Park, the first such case in the country. They had to be euthanized to avoid transmission to humans. As for cetaceans, the number of porpoise mortalities was particularly high this summer and some have wondered whether the disease may have been transmitted to this species. However, veterinarian Stéphane Lair of the Université de Montréal does not think that porpoises were affected by this flu, as they did not show the histological lesions that are usually found on carcasses. The high mortality might be explained by other factors such as a lack of prey. The white-sided dolphin carcass recovered in Rimouski © QMMERN mobile team As for the white-sided dolphin in Rimouski, this is the first confirmed case in this species. Stéphane Lair explains that the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine has received confirmation from the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA). In Canada, all cases must be reported to the CFIA for validation and reported under the Health of Animals Act. “In my opinion, cases in marine mammals will remain sporadic, so there will be little impact at the population level,” he argues. What does it eat in winter? Avian flu is an infectious disease caused by the influenza virus, which is classified into different types: A, B, C and D, each of which affects different species. Type D virus causes infections strictly in cattle, while virus types B and C generally affect humans, though not exclusively. Type A, on the other hand, usually affects avifauna, i.e. birds. These viruses attack the respiratory tract, causing not only respiratory, but also digestive and nervous symptoms. Viral transmission occurs through direct contact with infected excrement or secretions, or with contaminated equipment, water and food. Though rare, transmission to humans is not impossible. It is therefore recommended not to approach or touch a sick or dead animal.

This year's total of 50.54m birds - including chickens and turkeys - has surpassed a previous high set in 2015. Flocks in over 40 states have been affected, more than double the number of states in the previous outbreak. While the risk for humans is low, authorities have warned that safety measures should be taken near birds. The disease is spread by wild birds which transmit the virus through feathers, faeces and direct contact. "Wild birds continue to spread HPAI [highly pathogenic avian influenza] throughout the country as they migrate, so preventing contact between domestic flocks and wild birds is critical to protecting US poultry," Rosemary Sifford, the USDA's chief veterinary officer, was quoted as saying by Reuters. Why is bird flu so bad this year?In a 3 November announcement about the ongoing outbreak, the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) said that while the risk to the general public remains low, it is advising Americans to take "preventative measures" - such as avoiding direct contact with wild birds and avoiding unprotected contact with poultry - to prevent spreading the disease to humans, pets, birds and other animals. "This applies not just to workplace or wildlife settings, but potentially to household settings where people have backyard flocks or pet birds with potential exposures to wild or domestic infected birds," the statement added. While cases of human infections are rare, the CDC's website warns that the virus could spread when airborne - such as via droplets or dust - if it gets into a person's eyes, nose or mouth, or is inhaled. Symptoms of bird flu in humans have previously ranged from eye redness and mild flu-like symptoms, to pneumonia and difficulty breathing. World Health Organization (WHO) data shows that only 868 cases of transmission from birds to humans were recorded between 2003 and 3 November 2022, resulting in 456 deaths. In the US, only one case - a Colorado resident who was directly exposed to poultry - has been reported in the recent outbreak. The person reported fatigue for a few days and recovered, the CDC said in April. Poultry deaths stemming from avian flu led to rising prices for eggs and turkey ahead of last week's Thanksgiving holiday in the US. The American Farm Bureau, a US-based insurance company and lobbying group, said the price of a traditional Thanksgiving turkey had risen 21% over the last year and now stands at nearly $29 (£24.05) for a 16 pound (7.5kg) bird. Record outbreaks of avian flu have also swept across the UK and Europe, as well as parts of Africa and Asia. The World Organisation for Animal Health believes the wave of outbreaks is the result of international trade, farming practices and migratory wild birds. Over 4.6 million birds died or were culled between mid-October and mid-November alone, according to the organisation. On 31 October, concerns over the outbreak prompted officials in England to order that all poultry and captive birds must be kept indoors from 7 November. A similar measure went into effect on Monday in Northern Ireland, and is scheduled to be implemented in Wales on 2 December.

Learn who should take the antiviral medication and whether Tamiflu is safe for kids. By Nicole Harris Updated on November 29, 2022 Medically reviewed by Monika Goyal, M.D. Influenza infects an estimated 9 million to 41 million people each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The highly contagious illness, which is also called flu, brings along a wide array of symptoms—including fever, cough, chills, fatigue, muscle aches, and runny nose. Getting a flu vaccine is the best way to protect against the flu, but if illness strikes your family, your doctor might suggest taking Tamiflu, which is the trade name of oseltamivir, to lessen the severity of symptoms and shorten the course of the illness. Keep reading to learn more about Tamiflu, where to get this antiviral medication, who should take it, and the safety and side effects of Tamiflu in kids. What Is Tamiflu? "Tamiflu is an antiviral medication that decreases the multiplication of the flu virus," says Daisy Dodd, M.D., a pediatric infectious disease doctor for Kaiser Permanente in Southern California. To be effective, the medication needs to be taken within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms, The flu viruses must multiply in human cells to survive, explains Dr. Dodd. Tamiflu works by blocking this viral replication, decreasing the length of the illness by about 24 hours. This Is The Best Time for Your Family to Get the Flu Shot How Does Tamiflu Work? Early treatment with Tamiflu can lead to milder illness, which lessens the number of hospitalizations and deaths associated with the flu. But it's important to note that Tamiflu doesn't actually stop you from having influenza. "Tamiflu is different from antibiotics," explains Rhonda Patt, M.D., a pediatrician at Atrium Health Levine Children's Charlotte Pediatric Clinic-SouthPark. "Antibiotics are used to treat bacterial infections such as strep throat, pneumonia, or urinary tract infections. Tamiflu, on the other hand, may help reduce the duration or severity of the flu but does not cure the flu." Jimena Roquero / Stocksy Who Should Take Tamiflu? Tamiflu and generic versions of the medication are approved for the treatment of flu in children and babies as young as 14 days old. The CDC recommends Tamiflu for patients with severe cases of influenza, as well as patients who are considered at high risk for developing complications of the flu. Dr. Patt gives the following examples of people who might benefit from Tamiflu: Adults over 65 years oldAnyone taking medications that may suppress the immune systemChildren under 2 years old, who have a higher risk of potentially life-threatening complications like pneumonia and dehydrationPeople with chronic medical conditions, such as asthma, diabetes, lung disease, heart disease, or sickle cell anemiaPregnant people or those who have recently given birth Dr. Dodd adds that some parents also request Tamiflu if the family benefits from a speedier recovery—for example if a parent can't work when their child is sick. Common Side Effects of the Flu Shot in Kids Tamiflu Side Effects for Kids Although Tamiflu can shorten the duration of influenza, it's not without side effects. The most common are gastrointestinal issues like nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. They usually occur during the first two days of treatment. More severe Tamiflu side effects—such as confusion, hallucinations, or unusual behavior—occur on rare occasions, and children should be monitored for these reactions "It's unclear at this time whether these behavioral changes are true side effects of Tamiflu, but they have been observed in children and teens who have taken Tamiflu," says Dr. Patt. Is Tamiflu Safe for Kids? As with any medication, parents and doctors must weigh the risks versus the benefits. "If a child is having a mild case of the flu, the risk of stomach upset may outweigh the benefits of the medication—meaning that we allow influenza to just run its course without antiviral medication," says Dr. Patt. "However, if a child has a chronic medical condition or is having severe flu symptoms, Tamiflu is more strongly recommended as a treatment option." The Flu Vaccine for Children and Toddlers How to Get Tamiflu for Kids To work effectively, Tamiflu must be taken within 48 hours from the onset of illness, says Dr. Dodd. Influenza can be determined with a rapid test or evaluation from your doctor, who might decide to prescribe Tamiflu depending on your child's risk factors. Pediatricians can also treat "suspected influenza" with Tamiflu if it would benefit the patient, says the CDC. For example, they might give Tamiflu to a high-risk child who was exposed to the virus through a friend or sibling. Tamiflu isn't an over-the-counter medication—you can only get it through a prescription. It's available in either liquid or pill form, and it's generally prescribed for five days at a time. Doctors determine the correct Tamiflu dosage for kids, depending on factors like body weight and age. If your child takes Tamiflu, you should also encourage other flu-fighting remedies, such as rest, hydration, and possibly fever-reducing medications. "If a patient is prescribed Tamiflu, it is OK to still take antipyretics such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil) for fever or discomfort," adds Dr. Patt. When Does Flu Season Start and End? How Much Does Tamiflu Cost? The cost of Tamiflu depends on your health insurance and location. Without insurance, Tamiflu costs typically more than $100 for a five-day supply; it even can sometimes retail for closer to $200. Parents can also ask about generic versions of Tamiflu for kids that might cost less. If you have insurance, your cost may be significantly less. Was this page helpful? Thanks for your feedback!

Many patients are being treated at Cook Children’s Health Care System for flu A. Over the last week, more than 800 patients tested positive for flu A, marking a record high compared to the last few years. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) cases are declining compared to previous weeks, but remain high.Cook Children’s has expedited our winter staffing plan in preparation for peak flu season. Our census is full, including beds, the Emergency Department and Urgent Care Centers. Wait times are extremely long. We ask parents and caregivers to contact their pediatrician unless their child has a moderate or severe illness or injury.Be sure that you and your family are vaccinated against the flu and are updated on the latest COVID vaccines and booster shots. The flu vaccine works to prevent you from catching the flu – or, reduce the severity if you do come down with the illness.“We are seeing increased cases of flu admissions, particularly influenza infections associated with pneumonias,” said Laura Romano, D.O., Hospitalist at Cook Children’s Medical Center. “In addition to causing respiratory symptoms, the flu can also cause myositis, which results in significant muscle pain and requires admission for IV hydration and pain management. The best way to prevent influenza-associated pneumonia and influenza-induced myositis is to get your flu vaccine.”Respiratory illnesses, like flu and RSV, are typical for this time of year; RSV is a very common respiratory virus. Some children require hospitalization for RSV, but most do not. We are also seeing positive cases of COVID and rhinovirus in our patients.There are limited treatments for RSV; most are available for premature infants, infants with other lung diseases, infants who are considered immunocompromised, or patients with a congenital heart disease.“RSV cases continue to decline but we are still seeing children, particularly our most vulnerable patients, becoming significantly ill with symptoms,” Dr. Romano said. “Our most at-risk patients include those less than 12 weeks, any pre-term infant born at less than 34 weeks, or any baby with congenital lung disease or congenital heart disease.”Patient CensusIn the last 24 hours, 533 patients went to the Emergency Department, which is equivalent to one check in every 2 minutes. This is causing long wait times (8-10 hours) to transfer patients to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit.Across our seven Urgent Care Centers, there were 814 patients seen on Monday and 722 patients seen in the last 24 hours.There are steps families can take to avoid getting sick. Parents and caregivers can remind their children to continue the healthy habits learned in the pandemic, including hand hygiene, coughing into a tissue or your elbow and staying home if you or your child feel sick. Face masks add increased protection, especially in public spaces.Last year, more people were wearing face masks and children were more likely to stay home while sick. This year, parents are sending their children to daycare and school for the first time following two years of the pandemic, Dr. Romano said. Children who haven’t been previously exposed to respiratory viruses are among the many children who are getting sick.RSV cases at Cook Children’s Health Care System:Oct. 2 – Oct 8: 210 cases (24% positivity rate)Oct. 9 – Oct. 15: 288 cases (29% positivity rate)Oct. 16 – Oct. 22: 246 cases (24% positivity rate)Oct. 23 – Oct. 29: 263 cases (23% positivity rate)Oct. 30 - Nov. 5: 337 cases (23% positivity rate)Nov. 6 - Nov. 12: 342 cases (19% positivity rate)Nov. 13 - Nov. 19: 267 cases (15% positivity rate)Nov. 20 - Nov. 26: 222 cases (12% positivity rate)Positive Influenza A cases at Cook Children’s Health Care System:Oct. 9 – Oct. 15: 47 casesOct. 16 – Oct. 22: 75 casesOct. 23 – Oct. 29: 170 cases (14.6% positivity rate)Oct. 30- Nov. 5: 333 cases (22.6% positivity rate)Nov. 6 - Nov. 12: 483 cases (27.5% positivity rate)Nov. 13 - Nov. 19: 630 cases (35.4% positivity rate)Nov. 20 - Nov. 26: 812 cases (42.3% positivity rate)Pediatrician OfficesCall your pediatrician first if children are experiencing mild symptoms or injuries (ear pain, sore throat, diarrhea or vomiting, rash, cough or other non-urgent health concerns). The pediatrician’s office can help you decide what steps to take.As we prepare for the flu season to worsen, make an appointment with your pediatrician to get updated flu and COVID vaccines.

Laurel Wamsley/NPR hide caption toggle caption Laurel Wamsley/NPR It can be hard to find children's fever-reducing medication in some areas. At a Bed Bath & Beyond in Washington, D.C., on Thursday, a few products were in stock while others were sold out. Laurel Wamsley/NPR If you stroll the cold and flu medicine aisle these days, you might notice shelves that are bare, or nearly so. Some medicines that can be particularly hard to find are fever reducers for kids, like children's Tylenol, Motrin or Advil. Drug manufacturers point to a big spike in demand. That's not surprising, given the surge in three respiratory viruses right now: COVID, RSV and influenza, what has been termed a "tripledemic." Shots - Health News Experts are concerned holiday gatherings could accelerate a 'tripledemic' Johnson & Johnson makes Children's Tylenol and Children's Motrin. It says there is no nationwide shortage — just a lot of demand. "Consumer demand for pediatric pain relievers in the U.S. is high, but there are no supply chain issues and we do not have an overall shortage in the U.S.," company spokesperson Melissa Witt said in an email to NPR. The company says it is "experiencing high consumer demand and are doing everything we can to make sure people have access to the products they need." Sponsor Message Nationally, sales of pediatric internal analgesics — which includes drugs like acetaminophen and ibuprofen — were up more than 26% in October compared with a year earlier. That's according to data from the Consumer Healthcare Products Association (CHPA), a trade group that represents manufacturers of over-the-counter drugs. Shots - Health News Tylenol For Infants And Children Is The Same. Why Does 1 Cost 3 Times More? While there may not be a countrywide shortage, there is one part of the U.S. where finding these meds is most difficult: areas near the Canadian border. The Buffalo-Rochester area of western New York is seeing the highest demand in the U.S., CHPA says. Sales for such products in the Buffalo-Rochester market surged 53% in October compared to a year earlier. That's very likely the result of an ongoing shortage of kids' pain and fever medications in Canada, with Buffalo's close proximity to Toronto making it an ideal place for Canadians to buy such products in the U.S. Health RSV is surging. Here's what to watch for and answers about treatment options A spot check on Thursday in Washington, D.C., of four stores — a Giant supermarket, a CVS, a Target, and a Bed Bath & Beyond — found low supplies of children's fever-reducers, though each had at least a few of such medicines available. Supplies were low of cold and flu products for adults, as well. "The supply chain is strong," says Anita Brikman, a spokesperson for CHPA. But parents and caregivers may need to check more than one store, buy a store brand instead of a name brand, or order products online, she suggests. Sponsor Message Parents have a range of options for treating fevers So what to do if you have a fevered child, and are struggling to find Children's Tylenol or a similar product? There's a good chance you don't even need to use medicine, says Dr. Sean O'Leary, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Colorado School of Medicine and Children's Hospital Colorado, as well as the chair of the Committee on Infectious Diseases for the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). "These medicines are not curative. They don't alter the duration of the illness or anything like that. They are essentially purely for comfort," he tells NPR. "Fevers from common respiratory viruses in and of themselves are not harmful." He offers a scenario. "If [a child's] temp is 103, but he's running around the room having a good time playing, you don't need to do anything with that. That's not going to hurt him. Fever is representing our body's immune response to an infection. On the other hand, if he doesn't have a fever, but his throat is hurting, something is bothering him, he's pretty fussy — then that's where things like ibuprofen or Tylenol, acetaminophen can be helpful." AAP has guidance on treating a child's fever, as well advice on treating a fever without medicine. Shots - Health News For Kid's Coughs, Swap The Over-The-Counter Syrups For Honey Often when kids do have a fever, they do feel pretty crummy, and so that's a time to use such medicines — "It's to treat how the child is feeling," O'Leary says. Fever is a more serious concern in infants and children who experience febrile seizures. "Fever in very young infants, in newborns, is actually a different situation, and that's something that does need evaluation," O'Leary says. "Essentially, the younger the child, the more concerned you should be about a fever. For example, a 2-week-old with a fever is something that that needs immediate medical attention. A 6-month-old with a fever that's otherwise doing well does not need immediate medical attention. [Parents] can simply call their child's pediatrician to get that checked out." Sponsor Message Be very careful with adapting adult medications Parents at home might be eyeing their bottle of adult acetaminophen or ibuprofen and wondering if they could give a smaller amount to their sick child. But there's reason to be very cautious with that — and to consult a doctor or pharmacist first to find out the correct dosage for your particular child. "For both acetaminophen and ibuprofen, there are potential toxicities from taking too much — some of which can be quite severe, particularly for acetaminophen. So you really have to be careful when you do that," O'Leary says. Wendy Mobley-Bukstein, a professor of pharmacy practice at Drake University and the president of the American Pharmacists Association Academy of Pharmacy Practice and Management, agrees. Shots - Health News Giving Medicine To Young Children? Getting The Dose Right Is Tricky "It's best to talk to the doctor or pharmacist," she tells NPR. If a parent or caregiver "can weigh [the child] at home, tell us what they weigh on their scale at home, we can figure out what an appropriate dose would be for them to take," she says. She explains that repetitively giving a child too large a dose could have liver implications with acetaminophen, and kidney implications with ibuprofen. And Mobley-Bukstein has another piece of advice: Get kids vaccinated for COVID-19 and flu. "Even if you still get the flu or even if you still get COVID, it's definitely going to lessen the severity of the disease itself. And so just making sure that they're getting their immunizations is really important," she says. PSA: Please don't hoard the meds Brikman at the CHPA worries that the notion that there is a shortage will spur parents to buy more than they need. "If families start to stock up in worry, as opposed to buying what they need, we are concerned that that could amplify the situation," she says. Sponsor Message And if you were thinking of stocking up on a bunch of fever meds just in case, Mobley-Bukstein has a practical warning: These products do expire. "So putting a whole bunch of them in your medicine cabinet at home might not serve you if you don't get sick, or if your kids don't get sick," she says. "It's important for us to remember that they do have expiration dates, that it can be dangerous to give [children] expired medications. And so only buy what you need when you need it, and use up what you have at home before you go and buy new, if it's still in date." influenza fever medication COVID-19 RSV Facebook Flipboard Email Read & Listen Home News Culture Music Podcasts & Shows Connect Newsletters Facebook Instagram Press Public Editor Corrections Contact & Help About NPR Overview Diversity NPR Network Accessibility Ethics Finances Get Involved Support Public Radio Sponsor NPR NPR Careers NPR Shop NPR Events NPR Extra Terms of Use Privacy Your Privacy Choices Text Only Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsorPeru bird flu: Thousands of pelicans found deadSkip to contentBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsUS ElectionSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthVideoLiveHomeNewsIsrael-Gaza WarWar in UkraineUS & CanadaUKUK PoliticsEnglandN.

In total, more than 13,000 birds have been killed by the H5N1 avian influenza strain, according to biologists. Peruvian officials have declared a health alert to prevent its spread to farm poultry.H5N1 can spread extremely quickly between birds through their droppings and saliva.The virus can also spread to humans if they are in close contact with an infected bird, but scientists say the current strain seems to be low risk for this.Peru's agricultural health authorities have warned people not to handle wild birds or their carcasses and to notify them if they spot any dead animals.ReutersHealth officials in protective clothes have been removing the dead birdsAs well as the outbreak in Peru, there is currently a wave of bird flu in Europe and in the United States.

According to Alberta Health, 20.5 per cent of Albertans have received a flu vaccine this season. The immunization rate for children between six months and four years old sits at 12.7 per cent. (Leah Hennel/Alberta Health Services)Social SharingHealth experts are concerned Alberta's low flu vaccine uptake, particularly among vulnerable groups, could spell trouble as a harsh influenza season tightens its grip on the province.Two Alberta children have died of influenza since the start of the flu season. Kids up to the age of 19 account for nearly one-third of flu-related ICU admissions, according to provincial data.But even as transmission rates rise, just 20.5 per cent of Albertans have rolled up their sleeves for the annual flu shot.Children under the age of five and seniors are two of the groups at highest risk of serious complications due to influenza. Just 12.7 per cent of children between the ages of six months and four years have their flu shots, and 57 per cent of seniors have their dose. The immunization target for both groups is 80 per cent."That's low when you consider the fact that [young children] can be hit pretty hard by influenza in terms of severity and ending up in hospital," said Dr. Cora Constantinescu, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Alberta Children's Hospital, which is dealing with a wave of respiratory illnesses.Dr. Cora Constantinescu, pediatric infectious disease physician at the Alberta Children's Hospital, says children of all ages are being admitted to hospital with influenza. (Jennifer Lee/CBC)She is worried about vaccine uptake in all pediatric age groups."Considering how fast this influenza wave is climbing, I would definitely love to see the uptake in the vaccine rates climb as well. They're pretty low, though, and not enough to feel that our children our being sent to school protected at all." Staff scramble to relieve pressure on Alberta Children's Hospital as families are left waiting Alberta hospitals battle wave of sick children as viral illnesses surge According to Constantinescu, children of all ages are ending up seriously ill, and many of them were previously healthy."Influenza now is driving our ICU stays and hospitalizations in terms of respiratory viruses," she said."We're seeing a variety of ages of kids ending up intubated with influenza, with respiratory failure. We're seeing kids who can have brain effects from influenza. We're also seeing heart effects from influenza. And we also see very often a bacterial infection on top of influenza."According to the Public Health Agency of Canada's FluWatch report, there has been a "sharp increase" in pediatric hospitalizations in recent weeks.Today we are reporting our second influenza-related child fatality of the season. In the interest of privacy, we will not be providing additional identifying details. 1/6&mdash;@JasonCoppingABThe report notes weekly pediatric influenza hospitalizations are unusually high for this time of year and have exceeded levels normally seen during the peak of influenza season.Nationally, children under the age of five and adults 65 and older have the highest cumulative hospitalization rates.Seniors at riskAccording to a Toronto-based geriatrician, Dr. Samir Sinha, it's common for influenza to circulate first among kids."It's only a matter of weeks before what's happening with children is going to be happening with their parents, and then it's going to be happening with their grandparents," said Sinha, the director of geriatrics at Mount Sinai and the University Health Network.WATCH | Why health officials are urging people to get their flu shots this season:Low flu shot rates among Alberta kids and seniors a worry as influenza rages on2 years agoDuration 1:12Health experts are concerned Alberta's low flu vaccine uptake, particularly among vulnerable groups, could spell trouble as a harsh influenza season tightens its grip on the province. The CBC's Jennifer Lee has more."When we see such a high spike in the rates in children, we're just going to anticipate that we're going to see a significant spike happening especially amongst older populations in the coming weeks. And that's why it's really important that people get vaccinated."Sinha warned a 57 per cent vaccination rate among Alberta seniors leaves too many people at risk. The bulk of hospitalizations and deaths during a typical flu season occur in this age group, he said. Flu rising sharply in Canada, Dr. Theresa Tam says The worst of Alberta's respiratory virus surge could be yet to come, experts warn "I'm really concerned … because we know that when flu season hits Canada, it tends to hit the Prairie provinces first, and we know this flu season is going to be a particularly bad one," he said."We're going to see a significant burden of disease in terms of emergency department visits, hospitalizations and deaths occurring in larger than usual numbers."Dr. Samir Sinha, director of geriatrics at Mount Sinai and the University Health Network in Toronto, is concerned about vaccine uptake among Alberta seniors. (Tiffany Foxcroft/CBC)Nine of Alberta's 12 flu-related deaths have been in adults over the age of 60. One person who died was in their fifties.Both physicians are calling on Albertans to take key steps including masking, staying home when sick, frequent handwashing and getting their free flu shots."Flu is the second leading vaccine-preventable cause of death in Canada.… So that's why we really emphasize people getting vaccinated," Sinha said.ABOUT THE AUTHORJennifer LeeReporterJennifer Lee is a CBC News reporter based in Calgary.

(Leah Hennel)Social SharingAlberta is in the midst of the worst flu season it has seen in years and it's one of the hardest hit regions in the country.Influenza cases are spiking early and they've hit levels not seen since 2009, the year the new H1N1 virus emerged."The numbers right now approaching what we had seen in 2009, which was by far our worst flu season in the last several decades," said Craig Jenne, associate professor in the department of microbiology, immunology and infectious diseases at the University of Calgary."What's really concerning, though, is this curve hasn't started to slow." Calgary pediatric hospice discharging all respite patients, redeploying staff to children's hospitalAccording to the Public Health Agency of Canada's FluWatch report, Alberta has some of the most widespread influenza activity in the country.At the same time, less than one quarter — just 22.5 per cent — of Albertans have gotten their flu shot."Vaccine uptake is remarkably low in Alberta this year. We are well behind our average … and Alberta Health has even admitted that our past five-year average is still not sufficient for community level protection."Alberta's flu cases are approaching levels not seen since 2009, the year the new H1N1 virus emerged. (Rob Easton)The difference between 2009 and this year, noted Jenne, is there wasn't an effective flu vaccine broadly available targeting the emerging H1N1 virus at the start of that flu season.This year's vaccine targets both of the strains circulating in the province (H3N2 and, to much a lesser extent, H1N1), he said. Staff redeployment possible as Alberta Children's Hospital struggles with wave of sick kids Staff scramble to relieve pressure on Alberta Children's Hospital as families are left waiting "It has been rough for influenza and other respiratory viruses, certainly, this year," said Dr. Karla Gustafson, a medical officer of health in the Calgary zone.She is hopeful, though, that flu case numbers could be plateauing."It does look like things have settled a bit with two weeks of stable numbers in Alberta. They're high but … it doesn't look like they're climbing now, so we may be getting closer to a peak," said Gustafson."But with that, of course, [there are] lots of increased hospitalizations and ICU stays … and, unfortunately, deaths in Alberta from influenza across the ages."Flu hospitalizations increased by 268 last week. So far this flu season, 818 Albertans have been hospitalized due to influenza, and 80 of them have ended up in intensive care.Four more flu deaths have been reported for a total of 16 so far this season.Jenne believes it's too early to know if Alberta has reached its flu peak, adding he'd want to see several more weeks with clear downward trends."You have to keep in mind that those numbers are already very high. And we need a significant decline if we're going to slow the viral spread."Dr. Karla Gustafson is a medical officer of health in the Calgary zone. She says the flu case numbers could be plateauing. (CBC)Public messagingAlberta Health Services said it continues to strongly encourage people to book their free flu shots.It has a provincial advertising campaign running in airports as well as at both the Saddledome and Rogers Place during NHL and lacrosse games. "It's not too late to get your vaccine," said Gustafson, adding AHS recently opened some vaccination clinics on weekends in an effort to get more children vaccinated. Kids under five must get their flu shots through AHS public health clinics. Low flu shot rates among Alberta kids and seniors a worry as influenza rages on The province, meanwhile, launched a text and email campaign on Tuesday, encouraging influenza immunization.As of Friday afternoon, Alberta Health said it had sent 906,000 texts and 300,000 emails to people who have previously registered to receive notifications on the Alberta Vaccine Booking System.Gustafson said wearing a mask in public and staying home when sick can also help stem transmission."Sometimes we're most infectious in that day before we get sick or right when we're starting to feel unwell. So … if you have that inkling [that you're] feeling off, that is the most important time to avoid contact with others to help prevent the spread of illness."ABOUT THE AUTHORJennifer LeeReporterJennifer Lee is a CBC News reporter based in Calgary.

A 1-week hold of methotrexate was equally effective in terms of immediate and long-term influenza vaccine response in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), according to a recent study.Methotrexate is a first-line therapy for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) due to its efficacy, safety profile, and inexpensive cost.However, it significantly reduces response to pneumococcal and seasonal influenza vaccines, especially novel strain antigens; prior studies showed that withholding methotrexate for 2 weeks after patients received the seasonal flu vaccine improved immunogenicity. This study aimed to determine whether a 1-week hold worked just as well.For this prospective randomized parallel-group trial, 178 adult patients with RA were recruited from tertiary centers in South Korea. All met the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for RA and had been on a stable dose of methotrexate for at least 6 weeks. Patients were randomly assigned to withhold methotrexate for 1 week (90 patients) or 2 weeks (88 patients) after receiving the quadrivalent 2021-2022 seasonal flu vaccine (H1N1, H3N2, B-Yamagata and B-Victoria strains). A control group without an autoimmune disease acted as a reference.The primary outcome was a positive response at 4 weeks post vaccination, defined as a 4-fold or greater increase in antibody titers against at least 2 of the vaccine strains. Secondary outcomes were positive response and antibody titers at 4- and 16-weeks post vaccination.The proportion of patients achieving satisfactory vaccine responses were similar in the 1- and 2-week groups at 4 weeks and 16 weeks (69% versus 75% and 69.6% versus 70.3%, respectively). The vaccine responses in the patients with RA and controls were also similar.The researchers said it is not yet known if the strategy will work in other vaccines; they next want to see if the approach can be applied to other disease modifiying therapies and vaccines.Jin Kyun Park, MD, chief of rheumatology at Seoul National University Hospital, associate professor at Seoul National University College of Medicine, and the study’s lead author, said the main reason for undertaking the trial was to determine whether the time without methotrexate could be minimized to reduce the likelihood of disease flares.“Patients and physicians alike do not often know what to do with methotrexate when a vaccination, including the annual flu vaccine or novel COVID-19 vaccines, is required. It was relieving to find out that skipping methotrexate for one week is as effective as skipping it for two weeks to improve vaccine response with no increase in disease flare risk,” he said in a statement.The study was presented at ACR Convergence 2022, the ACR's annual meeting.Related VideosRelated Content AdvertisementNovember 11th 2024Possible Genetic Links Between Hidradenitis Suppurativa and CAD, Diabetes RisksMaggie L.

"Well, now, we are in contact with each other, we are unmasked, we are anticipating more social gathering and we could have these contacts with potential influenza carriers."McKinnon continued, explaining that it takes two weeks for the flu vaccine to take effect -- meaning now is the time to get vaccinated if you want to protect yourself and others this holiday season.To find more information about the flu vaccine and how to schedule an appointment, visit vaccines.gov.Stay ConnectedLike UsFollow Ussbg-envelopeNewsletter Sign up /sign-up© 2024 Sinclair, Inc.TermsFCCEEOFCCPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesLoading ...Landmark 20-strain mRNA flu vaccine looks to prevent future pandemics SUBSCRIBE AD-FREE LOG IN HOME SCIENCE Biology Environment Materials Medical Physics Space View all SCIENCE news Biology Environment Materials Medical Physics Space View all SCIENCE news TECH AI & Humanoids Consumer Tech Energy Manufacturing Military Robotics Deals View all TECHNOLOGY news AI & Humanoids Consumer Tech Energy Manufacturing Military Robotics Deals View all TECHNOLOGY news TRANSPORT Aircraft Automotive Bicycles Marine Motorcycles Urban Transport View all TRANSPORT news Aircraft Automotive Bicycles Marine Motorcycles Urban Transport View all TRANSPORT news LIFESTYLE Outdoors Tiny Houses Architecture Good Thinking Holiday Destinations View all LIFESTYLE news Outdoors Tiny Houses Architecture Good Thinking Holiday Destinations View all LIFESTYLE news BODY & MIND Medical Innovations Wellness & Healthy Living Illnesses and conditions Brain Health Medical Innovations Wellness & Healthy Living Illnesses and conditions Brain Health © 2024 New Atlas Menu HOME SCIENCE Biology Environment Materials Medical Physics Space View all SCIENCE news TECH AI & Humanoids Consumer Tech Energy Manufacturing Military Robotics Deals View all TECHNOLOGY news TRANSPORT Aircraft Automotive Bicycles Marine Motorcycles Urban Transport View all TRANSPORT news LIFESTYLE Outdoors Tiny Houses Architecture Good Thinking Holiday Destinations View all LIFESTYLE news BODY & MIND Medical Innovations Wellness & Healthy Living Illnesses and conditions Brain Health SUBSCRIBE AD-FREE LOG IN Show Search Search Query Submit Search Infectious Diseases Landmark 20-strain mRNA flu vaccine looks to prevent future pandemics By Rich Haridy November 27, 2022 Facebook Twitter Flipboard LinkedIn Landmark 20-strain mRNA flu vaccine looks to prevent future pandemics A new mRNA vaccine, not tested on humans, includes several strains of influenza with pandemic potential that have yet to cross over from animalsDepositphotos View 1 Image 1/1 A new mRNA vaccine, not tested on humans, includes several strains of influenza with pandemic potential that have yet to cross over from animalsDepositphotos An incredible new study published in the journal Science demonstrates the potential for a single mRNA vaccine to provide protection from all 20 known influenza A and B virus subtypes. It's hoped the vaccine, so far seen to be effective in preclinical animal models, would prevent future flu pandemics by promoting immunity against influenza strains yet to cross over from animals into humans.Vaccines work by helping teach the immune system to recognize certain parts of a pathogen, so when the real thing strikes our bodies can quickly recall that training and fight back. Our annual flu vaccines generally concentrate on between two and four antigens from the the strains of influenza most likely to be spreading at that time. Our recent COVID-19 vaccines, on the other hand, focus on just one iteration of the infamous SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.One of the hypothetical strengths of the recently emerged mRNA vaccine technology is its ability to present the body with a wide variety of different antigens at the same time. Older vaccine technology is unable to pack 10 or 20 different antigens into a single shot, but mRNA technology, in theory at least, doesn't face these limitations.So far, with the introduction of the latest bivalent Omicron mRNA vaccine booster, researchers have incorporated two particular antigens into the one shot. But what if a single vaccine could help teach the immune system how to recognize dozens of different iterations of the same virus?It is this very idea that researchers at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania explored in their landmark study. We created an mRNA vaccine expressing HAs from all 20 flu types. First, we vaccinated mice and found that this multivalent vaccine elicits robust antibody responses reactive to every HA. 2 pic.twitter.com/GrZLpfaN0U— Hensley Lab (@SCOTTeHENSLEY) November 25, 2022 The key antigenic target in influenza vaccines is a molecule called the hemagglutinin protein. It sits on the surface of the virus and is crucial to its infectivity. Each strain of influenza carries its own uniquely shaped hemagglutinin protein. The experimental mRNA vaccine tested in this new research covers 20 different influenza hemagglutinins: all 18 known subtypes of influenza A and two subtypes of influenza B.The newly published study reported testing the multivalent vaccine in mice and ferrets. As explained by Scott Hensley, senior author on the new study, the big takeaway from these experiments is the animals seemed to develop distinct antibodies against all 20 influenza strains. This shows a single mRNA vaccine can effectively deliver broad protection against a large number of different antigens."Our new vaccine does not simply elicit antibodies that cross-react to every known influenza subtype," Hensley explained on Twitter. "Instead, we found that that the vaccine elicits distinct antibody lineages against all 20 different flu HAs [hemagglutinin antigens]."The idea behind the novel vaccine is not to prevent influenza infection but to reduce the severity of disease that comes with those infections. And the initial animal studies do indicate that could be possible, with the vaccine effectively preventing severe disease in mice exposed to both the specific strains in the vaccine and other strains of influenza distinct from the specific 20 targets.Perhaps the most unconventional aspect to this vaccine is that it contains antigens from influenza strains that have yet to cross over into humans. Many of the 20 antigenic targets are types of influenza only currently circulating in animals. But according to Hensley, the big goal here is to get ahead of the next pandemic by building a degree of broad immunity in the human population."[In mice] the vaccine prevented severe disease and death against viruses that were distinct from the vaccine components," Hensley said on Twitter. "This resembles a pandemic situation. And that is our goal: to elicit a baseline level of immunity in the population that would not necessarily prevent infections with new pandemic strains – but rather prevent severe disease and death caused by new pandemic strains."This new work is far from the first to explore the potential of mRNA vaccine technology to fight influenza. A number of mRNA flu vaccines are in various stages of being trialed. Most recently a team of researchers demonstrated preclinical efficacy of a mRNA vaccine that targets four specific influenza proteins and is believed to offer universal protection against most strains.But what is particularly unique, and potentially controversial, about this new 20-strain mRNA vaccine is its targeting of many types of influenza that are not currently a problem in humans. The big hypothesis is that delivering a vaccine like this, particularly to very young children, could help prime their immune memory against all influenza subtypes for their entire life."The idea here is to have a vaccine that will give people a baseline level of immune memory to diverse flu strains, so that there will be far less disease and death when the next flu pandemic occurs," said Hensley. "We think this vaccine could significantly reduce the chances of ever getting a severe flu infection."Adolfo García-Sastre, from Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, called this new research "interesting" and "promising." While he is cautious, suggesting we wait for human clinical trial data before concluding this to be a significant breakthrough, García-Sastre noted if this strategy does work it certainly would help us get ahead of potential future flu pandemics."[The study] demonstrates the ability to be able to develop multivalent mRNA vaccines that are able to immunize against 20 or perhaps more different antigens at the same time," García-Sastre said. "In this case, these are influenza virus antigens that encompass all possible influenza virus subtypes and variants, including those with pandemic potential."It's a bold strategy that delivers on the promise of mRNA technology transforming the way we uses vaccines. But even if it does work it leaves plenty of questions for us all to grapple with. Are regulatory health authorities, or the general population, interested in a vaccine targeting future pandemics instead of immediate threats? Nevertheless, further preclinical tests are ongoing and Phase 1 human trials are being planned.The new study was published in the journal Science.Source: Penn Medicine Tags Infectious DiseasesVaccinesInfluenzaVirusPennsylvania State University Facebook Twitter Flipboard LinkedIn 3 comments Rich Haridy Rich has written for a number of online and print publications over the last decade while also acting as film critic for several radio broadcasters and podcasts.

Is it here to stay?It’s been an “unprecedented” year with the virus, and species like eagles, pelicans and vultures are all vulnerable.

The epicenter of the outbreak initially emerged in Brevard County and along Florida’s Atlantic Coast. [ DOUGLAS R. CLIFFORD | Times ]By Max ChesnesTimes staffPublished Nov. 29, 2022|Updated Nov. 29, 2022It was the morning of Jan. 22 when the fears of Florida wildlife biologists became reality.Reports of a highly infectious new bird flu strain had been confirmed a month prior in Canada, the launching pad for several migratory bird species that make their way to Florida. Biologists had been watching with anxious anticipation as birds wandered closer.Then, it arrived.The dreaded day unfolded when hunters in Palm Beach County turned over two ducks, just shot and killed, for routine disease testing at a checkpoint hosted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The pair of blue-winged teal ducks, with a white stripe down their faces and powder-blue wing feathers, were the first two animals in the state to test positive for the untreatable Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza. “That was Page 1,” said Mark Cunningham, a fish and wildlife health subsection leader for the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.“We’re on Page 500 now.”Laughing gulls mix with turkey vultures over the Hernando County Landfill on Tuesday, Nov 29, 2022, in Brooksville. More than half of all Florida counties have confirmed or suspected cases of the extremely infectious bird flu strain this year. The epicenter of the outbreak initially emerged in Brevard County and along Florida’s Atlantic Coast. [ DOUGLAS R. CLIFFORD | Times ]That day kicked off a busy year for Cunningham and his small team of veterinarians and wildlife technicians as they tried to track the unprecedented arrival of the virus. Fast forward 11 months, and thousands of wild birds are estimated dead, including beloved species like bald eagles and great horned owls.“It’s certainly been a busy year. There really is no comparison,” Cunningham said in an interview with the Tampa Bay Times. “This is the first time we’ve had a highly pathogenic avian flu in Florida’s wild birds. And it’s really blown up.”More than half of all Florida counties have confirmed or suspected cases of the extremely infectious bird flu strain this year. The epicenter of the outbreak initially emerged in Brevard County and along Florida’s Atlantic Coast in early February, as hundreds of lesser scaup ducks, a common North American diving duck with a black head, began showing signs of neurological distress. It has since spread as far north as Okaloosa and as far south as Miami-Dade.More than half of all Florida counties have confirmed or suspected cases of a highly infectious new bird flu strain ravaging the state's wild bird populations, according to data from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission posted Nov. 21. [ Courtesy of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Comission ]On paper, the U.S. Department of Agriculture shows roughly 1,450 cases in Florida through November. But the true total is suspected to be much higher, Cunningham said. Many cases are presumed positive, but haven’t undergone formal testing. Take, for instance, the state’s black vulture population: A sharp spike in bird flu cases was recently reported in vultures because an infected animal will often return to its roost before it dies. Then its fellow vultures will feed on the virus-laden carcass, spreading the disease further.Spend your days with HayesSubscribe to our free Stephinitely newsletterColumnist Stephanie Hayes will share thoughts, feelings and funny business with you every Monday.Loading...You’re all signed up!Want more of our free, weekly newsletters in your inbox? Let’s get started.Explore all your optionsThat cycle can’t be fully documented with testing, but the cases are out there. As Cunningham spells it out: If biologists see 50 dead birds and test three of them, and all three are confirmed to have the virus, the other 47 are suspected positive.“We estimate that it’s well into the thousands of birds that have died,” Cunningham said. And there’s “well over 2,000 confirmed cases” of vultures alone.The state wildlife commission says there is a “low risk” of humans contracting the virus, and no human cases have been confirmed in Florida this year. In April, a human case was confirmed in Colorado after somebody became infected when handling poultry that was presumed to be carrying the virus, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The person reported symptoms of fatigue for several days before recovering.Still, wildlife officials “caution that you avoid contact with these birds and contact your public health department with any concerns of a potential infection or exposure,” the agency writes on a webpage dedicated to the outbreak.A turkey vulture flies over an American Bald Eagle at the Hernando County Landfill on Tuesday, Nov 29, 2022, in Brooksville. More than half of all Florida counties have confirmed or suspected cases of the extremely infectious bird flu strain this year. The epicenter of the outbreak initially emerged in Brevard County and along Florida’s Atlantic Coast. [ DOUGLAS R. CLIFFORD | Times ]In the Tampa Bay area, at least six bird species have died from avian influenza, according to the latest U.S. Department of Agriculture data. That includes a trio of great horned owls that were all confirmed dead on the same day, June 29, and a bald eagle, black vultures and mallard ducks in Hillsborough County.Infected birds can, in some cases, be asymptomatic. That was what happened with the first two ducks that tested positive in January. They didn’t appear sick, Cunningham said. But some species can show visible symptoms, like lethargy, tremors, circling and seizures, according to the Florida wildlife agency. Sometimes birds are found dead with no signs of injury.Unlike other states, Florida has, for now, avoided cases spreading to commercial poultry flocks, according to Madeline Brezin, the deputy digital director for the Florida Department of Agriculture & Consumer Services. It’s a different story in other states: At least 1.8 million egg-laying hens will be killed in Nebraska and a 6-mile “control zone” was created after bird flu was confirmed there over the weekend, the Nebraska Department of Agriculture announced Saturday.“It is critically important that this does not occur in Florida,” the state’s wildlife agency warns on its website.But backyard poultry flocks here haven’t been as lucky.At least 21 backyard flocks across 11 Florida counties have been confirmed with bird flu since August, according to state agriculture data provided by Brezin. That includes two flocks in Hillsborough County, confirmed between Oct. 28 and Nov. 16, and one in Pasco on Oct. 26. The infected birds were mostly chickens, but there were also domestic ducks, geese, peafowl and guineas.An unprecedented bird flu outbreak is also affecting mammals. In September, the University of Florida announced a bottlenose dolphin in Dixie County was confirmed to have contracted the virus. [ Courtesy of the U.S. Department of Agriculture ]Wild populations of aquatic birds like pelicans and gulls have also succumbed to the virus in Florida, federal agriculture data show. The University of Florida announced in September that a bottlenose dolphin in Dixie County contracted bird flu in the first known case in North America. It likely came into contact with an infected bird along Florida’s Gulf Coast, according to researchers.Now that migratory waterfowl are returning to Florida, Cunningham predicts a surge of cases in duck and vulture populations in the Panhandle area this winter, he told the Times. Last year, the virus came from eastern Canada, along the Atlantic Coast. This year, it’s likely to come from what’s called the Mississippi Flyway, a bird migration path that stretches from the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico.There was a spike in Florida in September and October, and one theory is that Hurricane Ian stressed out birds and increased bird flu’s spread, according to Cunningham. Despite the unprecedented year and the busy workload, the team tasked with tracking the virus says there have been plenty of lessons learned as new science emerges. One is that the virus affects species differently; another is that the virus was supposed to fade away in warmer temperatures, but has persisted in the Florida heat.“We’ve learned a lot. It’s definitely a concerning disease,” Cunningham said. “Now that it’s been circulating in the population for about a year, hopefully soon it’ll start to taper off. That’s the question of the day.”Florida wildlife officials encourage the public to report bird mortalities so the disease can be studied and tested.

This makes the outbreak the worst in history, exceeding the 2015 outbreak, which claimed the lives of 50.5 million birds. While the 2015 epidemic was mostly limited to poultry farms, the current outbreak has expanded to almost every state. What exactly is avian flu? Avian influenza is a bird illness caused by infection with avian influenza Type A viruses. According to the CDC, domestic fowl, including chickens and turkeys, can become sick and transmit the disease, as can other bird and animal species. According to an epidemiologist, several strains of influenza infect people and animals. They've been watching it for two decades, and it's becoming a severe issue for animals and domestic cattle.Can humans become infected with bird flu? Avian flu viruses seldom infect humans, but there have been isolated examples. Since the virus spreads through mucus, saliva, and faeces, most infections develop when someone touches or inhales these fluids.What is causing the outbreak? The outbreak is thought to have started with wild birds. In January, the United States Department of Agriculture announced that a highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza was discovered in wild birds for the first time since 2016, primarily in North and South Carolina.Web DevelopmentDjango & PostgreSQL Mastery: Build Professional Web ApplicationsBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView Program Artificial Intelligence(AI)Basics of Generative AI: Unveiling Tomorrow's InnovationsBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView Program MarketingDigital Marketing Masterclass by Pam MooreBy - Pam Moore, Digital Transformation and Social Media ExpertView Program Web DevelopmentIntermediate Java Mastery: Method, Collections, and BeyondBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView Program AstrologyVastu Shastra CourseBy - Sachenkumar Rai, Vastu ShashtriView Program Web DevelopmentJavaScript Essentials: Unlock AI-Driven Insights with ChatGPTBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView Program Data ScienceSQL for Data Science along with Data Analytics and Data VisualizationBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView Program LeadershipBusiness Storytelling MasterclassBy - Ameen Haque, Founder of StorywallahsView Program FinanceA2Z Of MoneyBy - elearnmarkets, Financial Education by StockEdgeView Program Office ProductivityMastering Microsoft Office: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and 365By - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView Program Artificial Intelligence(AI)AI-Powered Python Mastery with Tabnine: Boost Your Coding SkillsBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView Program Web DevelopmentJava 21 Essentials for Beginners: Build Strong Programming FoundationsBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView Program Web DevelopmentA Comprehensive ASP.NET Core MVC 6 Project Guide for 2024By - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView Program Web DevelopmentAdvanced C++ Mastery: OOPs and Template TechniquesBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView Program Web DevelopmentMastering Full Stack Development: From Frontend to Backend ExcellenceBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView Program StrategyESG and Business Sustainability StrategyBy - Vipul Arora, Partner, ESG & Climate Solutions at Sattva Consulting Author I Speaker I Thought LeaderView Program MarketingPerformance Marketing for eCommerce BrandsBy - Zafer Mukeri, Founder- Inara MarketersView Program FinanceFinancial Literacy i.e Lets Crack the Billionaire CodeBy - CA Rahul Gupta, CA with 10+ years of experience and Accounting EducatorView Program Web DevelopmentAdvanced Java Mastery: Object-Oriented Programming TechniquesBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView Program Web DevelopmentIntermediate C++ Skills: Master Pointers, Structures and File StreamBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView Program FinanceA2Z Of Finance: Finance Beginner CourseBy - elearnmarkets, Financial Education by StockEdgeView Program Artificial Intelligence(AI)AI and Analytics based Business StrategyBy - Tanusree De, Managing Director- Accenture Technology Lead, Trustworthy AI Center of Excellence: ATCIView Program Web DevelopmentMaster RESTful APIs with Python and Django REST Framework: Web API DevelopmentBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView Program FAQs:Is avian influenza transmissible to humans?Exposure to diseased birds' saliva, mucus, or dung can result in direct infection.

Telegram Facebook Copy Link IANS Published On Dec 2, 2022 at 02:10 PM IST Read by: 100 Industry Professionals Read by 100 Industry Professionals Copenhagen: European health leaders have voiced their concern over a potential surge in respiratory virus infections across the region this winter, and called for better protection of the population, especially the most vulnerable.As concerns over the spread of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) increase and Covid-19 remains a threat, the 2022-2023 influenza (flu) season has gotten off to an early start in the European region, Xinhua news agency reported, citing a joint statement issued by European Commissioner for Health and Food Safety Stella Kyriakides, World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Director for Europe Hans Kluge and Director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) Andrea Ammon. Advt "The World Health Organization Europe region is currently experiencing increasing circulation of influenza and RSV. Together with Covid-19, these viruses are expected to have a high impact on our health services and populations this winter," the statement said.It highlighted the current influenza viruses (A and B), which are rising in circulation in different parts of the region, among all age groups. Those aged 55 years and older are particularly vulnerable. They have accounted for almost half of all reported influenza hospital admissions since October.Another cause for concern is the spike in RSV, a common respiratory virus that causes bronchitis or pneumonia and can be fatal, particularly in infants and the elderly. RSV cases have "also been on the rise since October, with some 20 countries and areas experiencing intensified RSV activity."While case rates, hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, and death rates are all currently low compared to the previous 12 months, there are concerns that "this situation could change as new variants emerge, and the disease continues to strain healthcare resources.""With the continued impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and the circulation and health impact of other respiratory pathogens, it is challenging to predict how the new winter period will develop," the statement said.The leaders also recommend that clinicians consider early antiviral treatments and prophylaxis for influenza, RSV and Covid-19 for those at risk of severe disease in order to prevent severe outcomes and reduce the burden on healthcare systems. Advt "We cannot say it enough: vaccination saves lives. It decreases the chances of being infected and reduces the risk of severe illness from Covid-19 and seasonal influenza," the document said.

Influenza (flu) vaccines, often called âflu shotsâ, are vaccines that protect against the four influenza viruses NEW DELHI: A study by the AIIMS cardiology department has recommended that people with weak cardiac conditions or those who have suffered heart failure should take influenza vaccines as they are effective in reducing the chances of a heart attack.The study, published in Lancet this year, was led by Dr Ambuj Roy, professor of cardiology, AIIMS. It was conducted across 30 centres in 10 countries in Asia, the Middle East and Africa.Seven centres were in India, six in China, four each in Philippines and Nigeria, three in Saudi Arabia, two in Mozambique and one each in Zambia, Kenya, Uganda and Zambia. The study, with 5,129 participants, was held between 2015 and 2021.âInï¬uenza infection has been associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events and death, especially in the acute period, which is why people are recommended to take the vaccine. There is data showing there is nearly 28% reduction in heart attacks, strokes and other cardiovascular diseases. Those who already had heart failures or attacks must take the inï¬uenza vaccine,â said Dr Roy.Most participants were recruited either from clinics focused on heart failure or through local investigatorsâ databases. Patients aged 18 years and above with a clinical diagnosis of heart failure and New York Heart Association (NYHA)âs functional classiï¬cation of heart failure II, III, or IV were eligible.In Kenya, Mozambique, Nigeria and Zambia, inï¬uenza circulates throughout the year, although peak periods of circulation still occur. In these countries, participants were enrolled in either October-November (autumn cohort) or April-May (spring cohort).âWe found there has been a significant reduction in hospitalisation and deaths due to heart disease. Heart failure poses a major global burden to health. It has been estimated that the number of patients with heart failure has nearly doubled from 33.5 million in 1990 to 64.3 million in 2017,â Dr Roy said.âA lower rate of cardiovascular events related to ischaemia (a condition in which the blood flow/oxygen is restricted or reduced in a part of the body) was reported for inï¬uenza vaccination in the study. Given the increasing burden of heart failure and the low use of routine inï¬uenza vaccination in low- and middle-income countries, we did a randomised controlled trial there,â he added.âIt was also found that if people are given the influenza vaccine, there is a reduction of 50% of further heart failure,â Dr Roy said.

The previous weekly record was 610 cases reported Feb. 23-29, 2020.Flu became a reportable disease in Erie County in 2003."We are seeing a lot of people test positive for flu," said Dr. Tim Pelkowski, a family physician and program director of the Saint Vincent Family Medicine Residency Program. "It's not any more virulent than usual, though it is early in the season."Flu season typically peaks between January and March, though previous seasons have started as early as October and as late as February. Cases are also surging as COVID-19 and respiratory syntical virus continues to spread in northwestern Pennsylvania.More: Erie County sees surge in COVID-19 deaths as cases, hospitalizations declineOne possible reason for the spike in reported flu cases is that physician offices and hospitals are testing more people than ever, due to the presence of all three respiratory illnesses."We are certainly testing more people because of COVID, and I'm sure that's part of the increase," Pelkowski said. "But that is still a lot of flu out there."Most of the patients are children, as 69% of the county's 1,618 cases this season are people 18 or younger. Only 4% are 65 or older, according to county health department data.More: Flu surges in Erie County, while RSV cases remain high and COVID-19 cases dropOlder people are more likely to get a flu vaccine, and more likely to wear face masks and take other precautions when out in public, said Dr. Ivan Loker, a doctor with UPMC Hamot's Harborcreek Family Physicians."Older folks are certainly more likely to get the vaccine and wear a mask," Loker said. "Getting a 35-year-old to get a flu shot can be an uphill battle, to say the least."Hospital admissions for flu had been relatively low so far this season, with just 19 patients as of Nov. 26, according to the county health department. But that appears to have changed in the past week."We are hearing of more hospitalizations with flu in recent days," Erin Mrenak, county health department director, said earlier this week. "It's pretty severe for some people."Those usually most at risk for severe flu symptoms include young children, older people and those with chronic illnesses, such as asthma and diabetes.One of Loker's patients recently tested positive for both COVID-19 and flu, the first time he could recall such a diagnosis."The patient felt really run down, really exhausted," Loker said. "Thankfully, it was a younger, normally healthy individual, so I recommended supportive treatments. I'm glad it wasn't one of my older patients."Here is a look at the recent weekly number of flu cases in Erie County:Nov. 20-26 — 647Nov. 13-19 — 389Nov. 6-12 — 257Oct. 30-Nov. 5 — 160Oct. 23-29 — 87Source: Erie County Department of HealthContact David Bruce at dbruce@timesnews.com.

Recently, researchers in Japan investigated the role of a particular group of amino acids, known as D-amino acids, in the progression of viruses like influenza A virus (IAV) and Sars CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19.In a new study published in BBA – Molecular Basis of Disease, the research team have uncovered a relationship between D-amino acids and severe viral infection in both animals and humans. While our understanding of COVID-19 has evolved during the COVID-19 pandemic, methods to predict disease severity and treat severe COVID-19 infection have been somewhat limited. D-amino acids have been previously shown to function as biomarkers for diseases such as kidney disease. However, the significance of D-amino acids in viral infection has not yet been explored, spurring the research team to investigate whether D-amino acids are affected during severe IAV infection or COVID-19. “We first assessed serum levels of D-amino acids in a mouse model of severe IAV infection and found that D-amino acids were greatly reduced in these mice compared with uninfected mice,” says lead author of the study Shihoko Kimura-Ohba. “When we evaluated serum from patients with severe COVID-19, we also found reduced levels of D-amino acids compared to those of healthy control subjects.” The researchers next explored the effects of supplementation with a specific D-amino acid known as D-alanine in mouse models of IAV infection and COVID-19. IAV mice exhibited a severe reduction in body weight that was mitigated by D-alanine treatment, while survival rates were improved in COVID-19 mice who received D-alanine treatment. “Our results indicate that D-amino acids may serve as biomarkers to reflect the severity of viral infection,” says senior author Tomonori Kimura. “Additionally, although the observed effects of D-alanine supplementation were limited, treatment with D-alanine may help to improve clinical outcomes in patients with severe viral infection.” The mechanism of D-alanine in the improvement of viral prognosis has yet to be elucidated. However, the research team’s findings indicate that D-amino acids represent promising biomarkers and therapeutic options for the evaluation and treatment of severe viral infections, including those associated with COVID-19.

Dolly Butz Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save Dolly Butz SIOUX CITY — Cases of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) continue to dominate local clinics, urgent cares and emergency departments, while COVID-19 activity remains "low" in Woodbury County and influenza rates are beginning to tick up. "We're seeing as much of RSV as anything," said Dr. Steven Joyce, a MercyOne Internal Medicine and Pediatrics physician. "With RSV, we always say, the very young and the very old are the ones who are most affected."RSV generally causes mild cold-like symptoms, which people usually recover from in a week or two. The virus is the most common cause of bronchiolitis, inflammation of the small airways of the lungs, and pneumonia in children younger than 1 year of age in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Children's Hospital Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics recently called upon the Biden administration to declare an emergency in response to "unprecedented levels" of RSV in young patients.

Outgoing Woodbury County Supervisor Jeremy Taylor Scholten wins second term in Iowa House District 1 The CDC reports that the RSV hospitalization rate among seniors is 10 times higher than it normally is at this point in the season. When it comes to treating RSV, Joyce said there isn't much you can do, other then rest, hydrate and take Tylenol or ibuprofen to relieve symptoms. "In little kids, there's very little evidence that support inhaler use or steroids, certainly not antibiotics, it being a virus," he said. "There isn't really much that truly helps, from a scientific standpoint." The State Hygienic Laboratory at the University of Iowa reported 1,341 cases of RSV from Nov. 13 to 19, up from 938 and 810 cases the previous two weeks. Overall flu activity was "moderate," according to the respiratory virus surveillance report. Data updated by the Iowa Department of Public Health on Nov. 22, shows 99 positive COVID-19 tests, which is up from 89 positive tests reported on Nov. 15. Eighty-three positive tests were reported on Nov. 8. Joyce said he suspects that COVID-19 case numbers will remain fairly steady. "More gatherings and indoor gatherings -- that's probably what leads to more spread of any of these: influenza, RSV, COVID," he said. "The benefit of influenza and COVID is that we have vaccinations for those. We do not for RSV. And, speaking specifically about COVID, that is, I think, the biggest reason of all that we haven't seen a big surge and much of anything." Joyce said it's possible to have COVID-19, influenza and RSV, which have overlapping symptoms, at the same time. "They can all have very similar symptoms, especially in adults," he said of the viruses. "You get runny nose, congestion, low grade fevers. I would say the deep muscle aches more with influenza, but certainly not a defining characteristic."With adults, Joyce said it can be "exceptionally difficult, if not impossible" to differentiate between the three viruses over the phone based on symptoms. "Many, many times, we have a person who comes into the office with any number of those symptoms, and they actually have none of them," he said. "They don't have RSV. They don't have influenza. They don't have COVID. They have just some other upper respiratory virus, which again, there's no specific treatment for." Joyce said you should be sure to stay home when you're sick to prevent RSV, COVID-19 and influenza from further spreading in the community. He said practicing good handwashing and sleep hygiene, as well as getting adequate amounts of exercise are key to staying healthy. "I would say the two big ways that you prevent it are, if you're sick, stay home. And, wash your hands frequently when you're around other people, so you don't do that hand to mouth, hand to nose contamination," he said. $1 for 13 weeks RSV symptoms Runny noseDecrease in appetiteCoughingSneezingFeverWheezingSource: CDC COVID-19 Fever or chillsCoughShortness of breath or difficulty breathingFatigueMuscle or body achesHeadacheNew loss of taste or smellSore throatCongestion or runny noseNausea or vomitingDiarrheaSource: CDC Influenza fever or feeling feverish/chillscoughsore throatrunny or stuffy nosemuscle or body achesheadachesfatigue Some people may have vomiting and diarrhea, though this is more common in children than adults.Source: CDC 0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0 Get local news delivered to your inbox!

LOUIS – A trio of diseases (COVID-19, Influenza, RSV) are rising throughout the United States, including the St. Louis region. It’s a trend many have dubbed ‘tripledemic’ as winter draws closer. Each virus shares similar symptoms, and rising cases could lead to crowded medical facilities in the upcoming weeks. Heading into the first weekend of December, St. Louis City and County health officials reported more than 1,000 cases of COVID-19 and flu over the last week. FOX 2 has compiled information on all three diseases, plus some resources to consider addressing each one in the St. Louis area.

Cough? Here's What to Know If You're Ill or Were With Someone Who Was Experts say there are some important steps to take - no matter your symptoms Published November 30, 2022 • Updated on November 30, 2022 at 1:44 pm With COVID, RSV, flu and a number of other viruses circulating heavily, chances are you're either sick or know someone who is right now. So what should you do if you're feeling ill or were around someone who was ill over the Thanksgiving holiday? Experts say there are some important steps to take - no matter your symptoms. 📺 24/7 Chicago news stream: Watch NBC 5 free wherever you are Start by determining what you can and take necessary precautions. According to the Illinois Department of Public Health, anyone who was exposed to someone with COVID should wear a mask for 10 days when around others and avoid contact with persons who are at high risk for severe disease and large gatherings. The health department notes that the "date of last exposure" should be considered day 0. Then, it is suggested that anyone who is ill or was exposed to someone who was, should take a COVID test - even if you're not feeling any symptoms following a Thanksgiving get-together. When should you test? With the incubation periods of the current prevalent strains of the omicron variant dropping down to just over three days, some experts suggest testing early and often. Repeat testing is recommended for those who test negative. Local Delphi Murders 11 mins ago Sentencing set after Richard Allen found guilty in Delphi murders Illinois Lottery 1 hour ago Largest Fast Play lottery prize in US history up for grabs in Illinois "Even if one has no symptoms, I would certainly test on day three and then test again at day five," Dr. Sharon Welbel, director of Hospital Epidemiology and Infection Control for Cook County Health, told NBC Chicago. IDPH recommends those who are asymptomatic test again on Day 6 following your exposure. Feeling out of the loop? We'll catch you up on the Chicago news you need to know. Sign up for the weekly Chicago Catch-Up newsletter. "People should use multiple tests over a certain time period, such as two-three days, especially when the people using the tests don't have COVID-19 symptoms," guidance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration states. If you test positive, it means that the test detected the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and you most likely have COVID. You are then encouraged to follow the CDC’s guidance for people with the virus, including staying at home, isolating from others and seeking follow-up care with a health care provider if necessary. But with the current prevalence of the flu and RSV, a COVID test may not be the only test you need to take if you're feeling sick. “(COVID) can really mimic influenza, so it’s impossible to tell,” Welbel said. “It is worthwhile seeing a provider to get molecular tests. (There are) all-in-one tests that test for COVID and influenza and RSV and others. That’s really ideal, because really you want to start therapy in the first few days (after the onset of symptoms).” With different therapies and treatments existing for COVID-19 and influenza, Welbel said that knowing which one you have if you are sick can both help ensure the best possible treatment for the patient while helping keep those in public settings safer. IDPH notes that for other respiratory viruses, like influenza, RSV, parainfluenza virus and more, home tests are not as easily accessible. "If you test positive for flu make sure you discuss treatment with your provider within two days of falling sick," IDPH recommends. The department also stressed staying home if ill, even if it's not COVID. "If COVID testing is negative, people should still remain home and away from others until other symptoms have improved and they are fever-free for 24 hours without use of fever reducing medication," the department told NBC Chicago. "You may need special care to avoid contact with those who have weakened immune symptoms and are at risk of getting severely ill from these viruses." Lastly, experts encouraged anyone who is eligible to get vaccinated for both flu and COVID as the holiday season ramps up.

From: UK Health Security Agency Published 30 November 2022 Following the latest UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) data showing the low uptake of the flu vaccine among 2 and 3 year olds and the high rates of under 5s being hospitalised with flu, UKHSA is warning parents of the importance of ensuring their young children are vaccinated. During week 46 (between 14 and 20 November), it is estimated that over 200 children under 5 were hospitalised suffering from serious complications caused by flu. These figures are estimated based on confirmed influenza cases in NHS acute hospitals. The uptake of the flu vaccine among 2 and 3 year olds (30.9% and 32.9% respectively in week 46) has dropped considerably when compared with the last 2 years, by around 11%. Flu is now circulating at higher levels than recent winter seasons and young children are particularly vulnerable and can become seriously unwell. Due to coronavirus (COVID-19) restrictions in the past couple of years most young children will not have ever encountered flu. This means they will not have built up any natural immunity to this virus, so it is particularly important for them to take up the flu vaccine this year. GP surgeries are inviting children aged 2 and 3 years old (age on 31 August 2022) for the nasal spray vaccination at their practices. If you haven’t heard from your GP surgery you should contact them directly to make an appointment. All primary school children and some secondary school children are also eligible for the flu nasal spray this year, which is usually given at school. Dr Conall Watson, Consultant Epidemiologist at UKHSA, said: Young children are particularly vulnerable to becoming very poorly from flu. For the third week running we have seen hospitalisation rates among children under 5 jump up, with a 70% increase in just the last week. Over 200 children were hospitalised because of flu in one week. Flu is now circulating at higher levels than recent years and because of the pandemic restrictions most young children will not have encountered flu before. This means they will have no natural immunity and are therefore at even greater risk this year. Two and 3 year olds can get protection with a free nasal spray vaccine from the NHS. Nobody wants their child to get sick so I strongly urge parents to book the vaccine at their GP surgery as soon as possible. Case study Anjali and Ben Wildblood from Bristol, parents of a 2-year-old boy, Rafa, wanted to share their story to encourage other parents of 2 to 3 year olds to ensure their child receives the flu vaccine. Both work as NHS consultants and had every intention of getting their son vaccinated as soon as possible, but could not attend the appointment they were offered and before they could reschedule their son became very sick. Ben and Anjali told us about their experience: Before we were able to get our 2-year-old son, Rafa, booked in for a flu vaccine, over the course of a weekend he became very sick, with a high temperature and breathing difficulties. He had previously suffered with croup and had been treated with steroids, but this was clearly some other very concerning respiratory problem. We took him into A&E where he was treated and we returned home. But his condition got worse again, with a soaring temperature and exhaustion – he had no strength whatsoever and what was so extremely worrying was that he barely had the strength to breathe; every parent’s worst nightmare. We returned to A&E and he was admitted to the paediatric Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Even as NHS consultants, seeing your child in ICU is a terribly frightening experience. He was put under general anaesthetic and intubated, which involved inserting a tube into his throat so he was able to breathe. His swab results came back showing he had Influenza type A. After 2 long agonising days of intubation in ICU, his condition improved and he began to recover. He is now home and doing well. No parent wants this for their child or to go through a similar terrible experience. We urge other parents of 2 to 3 year olds to ensure your child gets their flu vaccine as soon as possible. Our son has now been vaccinated as we wanted to be sure he was protected against other strains of flu that may be circulating.

Here’s What All Bird Hunters Need to Know Hunters across the flyways have seen notable die-offs of snow geese and other waterfowl By Alex Robinson Updated on Dec 1, 2022 12:37 PM EST Dead snow geese collected from a lake near Eureka, South Dakota. The geese were suspected to have died from bird flu. Greg Kottsick Share As of Monday, more than 52 million birds across the United States have died of bird flu, which makes this year the deadliest in history, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The outbreak (from strain H5N1) has hit domestic poultry hardest—farm-raised chickens and turkeys—but it has also impacted wild birds, and hunters have taken notice. Earlier this year the Canadian border closed importation of most wild waterfowl (before opening it back up again) and there have been several instances of massive culls at pheasant farms to prevent the flu from spreading. But what most hunters are concerned about is the long-term impact on our wild bird populations. Will duck and goose numbers crash because of bird flu? Horror Stories from the Field Earlier this year I interviewed Greg Kottsick, a waterfowl hunter from South Dakota who spent a weekend last April picking up dead snow geese. Kottsick and a group of buddies were cleaning up two lakes on the west side of Eureka that were littered with snow and blue geese, all dead or dying from what they suspected was avian flu. Based on recommendations from state fish and game officials, Kottsick and his buddies wore gloves, masks, and Tyvek suits. “The lakes are right in town,” Kottsick says. “Cats and racoons were dragging carcasses up on the bank. Plus, people were concerned because we had some track and field events going on and there were sick geese near the field and park. It was pretty gruesome. People were worried about their dogs getting into them. So, we got a bunch of guys together to pick up as many as possible.”By the end of the day, Kottsick and his buddies had picked up 462 dead birds and piled them in a front-end loader. They buried the waterfowl in a pit at a nearby farm. There were another 200-300 dead or dying geese that the volunteers couldn’t get to, Kottsick says. As waterfowl species continue their spring migration, anecdotes like Kottsick’s are cropping up across the Central Flyway. Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (commonly called “bird flu” or “avian flu”) has made headlines this year as it wreaks havoc on domestic poultry, but it’s also killing a substantial number of wild birds. Bird flu, which spreads through nasal secretions, saliva, and feces, is common in waterfowl, but it doesn’t usually result in notable mass die-offs of wild ducks and geese. This year seems different. Cleaning up dead snow geese in Eureka, South Dakota. Greg Kottsick Based on anecdotes and reports from the spring migration, it’s likely that this year’s strain of bird flu is deadlier for wild birds than it has been in previous years. These reports have hunters concerned and wildlife managers hustling to establish surveillance efforts. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has set up a bird flu tracking page, but it’s clearly not capturing the bird deaths that hunters are seeing in the field. For example, the CDC tracker shows that there have been only 4,238 detections in wild birds, but in McPherson County, South Dakota, Kottsick and his buddies cleaned up 462 dead waterfowl in just that one weekend. A report from Arkansas said officials there found more than 1,500 dead waterfowl in just the last few weeks. The discrepancy is likely because hunters don’t report all the cases they find and because surveillance and reporting efforts are still being organized. “This one feels a little different,” says Mike Brasher, a waterfowl scientist for Ducks Unlimited. “It feels like there’re higher mortality rates among wild birds, but I don’t know if we have the data to really back that up yet … We have to wait to see the data before we [talk about infection rates and mortality rates].” Until researchers can a better handle on the size and scope of this outbreak, let’s take a look at what we do know about bird flu’s impact on wild birds and waterfowl hunting so far—and what we don’t know about virus. How can I tell if a wild duck or goose has bird flu? Many wild birds carry avian flu without showing any symptoms. But other infected birds can experience complete paralysis, swelling around the eyes, and twisting of the head and neck, according to the USDA. While hunting in North Dakota last weekend, my buddy Todd Gifford and I found this sick snow goose that appeared to be dying of bird flu. As you can see in the video below, the goose is having spasms in its neck and appears unable to control its head. We saw several geese that had these same symptoms. Through our years of hunting, we’ve come across plenty of snow geese that have been crippled for one reason or another, but this was different. The birds that we suspected were dying of avian flu had no noticeable injuries whatsoever. They were unable to fly away or run and they were clearly struggling with coordination and mobility. Will bird flu crash duck and goose populations? Probably not, but it’s too early to tell. “We’ll have infection rate information at some point over the coming year,” says Brasher. “The thing that seems to be different this year is its lethality to wild birds, based on what we’re seeing at this time. Typically, avian flu occurs in the background of waterfowl populations and we most often don’t see its effects. In terms of why we seem to be seeing something different this year, is because just like with the coronavirus, viruses mutate. There seems to be a fairly large number of mutations associated with this strain.” According to the CDC reports, there were infections in 229 snow geese, 657 mallards, and 380 Canadas. These are all species with relatively hardy populations. But there were also waterfowl killed by bird flu from more sensitive species, like wigeon (171 recorded) and pintails (43 recorded). Even so, if mortality rates are low, it’s unlikely that biologists or hunters will notice population-level changes in waterfowl species. Species that congregate in large, dense flocks are likely most susceptible. Shorebirds, gulls, and raptors have also been found with the virus. Can bird flu infect people? Yes, but for now it’s extremely rare. Here’s information straight from the CDC: “Human infections with bird flu viruses can happen when virus gets into a person’s eyes, nose or mouth, or is inhaled … Human infections with bird flu viruses have occurred most often after unprotected contact with infected birds or surfaces contaminated with bird flu viruses. However, some infections have been identified where direct contact with infected birds or their environment was not known to have occurred.” So far, there have been 1 recorded cases of humans being infected with avian flu in the U.S. according to the CDC tracking page. Is it safe to clean and eat wild waterfowl? Yes, but don’t handle or eat birds that are obviously sick. This is a good rule to live by even when avian flu isn’t rampant. Beyond that, the Animal Plant Health Inspection Service has the following recommendations: Wear gloves when cleaning game birds.Do not eat or drink while cleaning or handling game.Avoid cross-contamination. Keep uncooked game in a separate container, away from cooked foods.Poultry should reach an internal temperature of 165°F to kill disease organisms and parasites.Dress game birds in the field whenever possible. Can my hunting dog get bird flu? The experts I spoke to said not to send your dog to retrieve birds that are obviously sick or found dead in the field. Just like not eating visibly sick birds, this is a good rule all the time. That said, based on the available research, it doesn’t seem like bird flu is a serious threat to hunting dogs. But it’s not impossible for a dog to contract avian flu, either. “Avian influenza risk to dogs is very, very low but not zero,” Sarah Bailey, the assistant state veterinarian of the North Dakota Board of Animal Health, wrote in an email. “Dogs are more likely to get canine-specific influenza A from other canines and there are other common respiratory diseases (kennel cough, distemper, etc.) I would rule-out first if a hunting dog got sick.” There is at least one report of a fatal H5N1 HPAI case in a dog that ate the carcass of an infected duck (which you can read more about here). What are wildlife agencies doing about bird flu? Major surveillance efforts are underway. Just like in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, mass testing is critical to understanding how widely the virus has spread, and how much of a threat it might be. Wildlife agencies know this well from previous years dealing with bird flu, and they’re hustling to ramp up testing. “State agencies, federal agencies, and the National Flyway Council are all working on this,” says Brasher. “They’ve gone through this before. So, there is definitely a full-court press up and running. I’ve heard that they are trying to achieve surveillance sampling of wild birds in the tens of thousands over the next year or more. This is a priority for state and federal agencies right now. That’s out of joint concern for commercial poultry operations and wild birds.” Counties where bird flu has been recorded in wild birds, according to the CDC reporting page. CDC How can hunters help contain bird flu? There are two things hunters can do to help: Report any sick birds we find.Avoid accidentally spreading the virus. When I returned home from my North Dakota trip, I reported the dead and dying snow geese we found to the state’s wildlife mortality reporting page. Many states have similar pages set up through their wildlife agencies. Just run a simple Google search for your own state and report sick and dead birds when you find them. Reporting sick and dead birds will help researchers track the virus and get an understanding of its prevalence.When it comes to not spreading the disease, follow these guidelines from APHIS: Keep a separate pair of shoes to wear only in your game cleaning area. If this is not possible, wear rubber footwear and clean and disinfect your shoes before entering or leaving the area.Use dedicated tools for cleaning game, whether in the field or at home. Do not use those tools around poultry or pet birds.Double-bag the offal and feathers. Tie the inner bag, take off your gloves, and leave them in the outer bag before tying it closed. Then wash your hands or use hand sanitizer.Place the bag in a trash can that poultry and pet birds cannot access. Make sure the trash can is covered and children, pets, or other animals can’t get into it.Wash all tools and hunting gear thoroughly. Waterfowl experts say it’s critical to prevent spreading the virus from wild birds to domestic poultry. They also say that just like with other flu viruses, the spread tends to slow when the weather warms. Until then—and until more data is collected—hunters should remain cautious, but hopeful. “We shouldn’t panic with this,” says Brasher. “We should take reasonable precautions and wait for the information to come in. We’ve learned a lot about this disease over the last decade-plus and we know that the greatest risk is to poultry operations, so that’s the area where we need to exercise the greatest caution.” As for Kottsick and his buddies, they sat out this spring snow goose season. Kottsick says that after seeing all the carnage around Eureka, he wants to see how the virus plays out before harvesting wild waterfowl—or upland birds.“God forbid that it gets into our pheasants,” he says. Summary There have been substantial die-offs in wild birds from bird flu. But, it's too early to diagnose the prevalence and lethality of the virus.

Photo: DOC A wildlife vet is worried a strain of bird flu currently circulating the US and the UK could have a devastating impact on wild native bird populations, if it reaches New Zealand. The strain of Avian Influenza A(H5N1) has been circulating throughout Asia since 2014 but has now spread to other parts of the world. In Europe 48 million birds have been culled in the last year in an effort to limit the spread, and in the United States 50m birds have died. The disease has also recently been detected in Peru where nearly 14,000 pelicans and sea birds have died. - A Guillemot displaying the classic signs of a strain of Avian Influenza A(H5N1) in Northern England in 2022. Video / David Steel Massey University Professor Brett Gartrell who is a veterinary expert said this strain of Avian Influenza was highly infectious. Avian influenza had been present in birds for a long time and in the past it mostly hit poultry breeders overseas but currently a "really scary variant of the avian influenza" was spreading and this global outbreak was unprecedented, he said. Massey University Professor Brett Gartrell Photo: Supplied "This current strain is different in that it is much more likely to spread between different species of wild birds and it's much more likely to cause serious disease and death in those wild birds as well." That had allowed this strain of bird flu to travel around the globe in a way that had not been seen before, he said. "The nearly 50 million birds that have died in the US, that's just this year alone and it only entered the country the previous year." The risk of this strain of avian influenza causing illness in people was low, however it could if it mutated or changed, he said. Wherever the disease occurred, health authorities "tended to take very strong precautionary principles around human health", Gartrell said. This avian flu epidemic was moving into areas where highly pathogenic avian influenza had not been seen before, although like all epidemics it would eventually run its course, he said. Fears for endangered bird species if A(H5N1) gets to NZ The birds that are being exposed to this avian flu have no immunity to it, he said. "That's our concern with New Zealand birds in particular, is that we haven't had an avian influenza outbreak here for a very long time, we've got what we call low pathogenic avian influenza circulating in water fowl, but they're not going to give our birds any immunity at all to this virus if it gets into the country." Gartrell said he feared for New Zealand's more critically endangered bird species if the avian influenza did arrive here. Internationally, measures around the avian influenza were to protect poultry industries and human health rather than wild bird populations, he said. "So trying to control it in poultry flocks and things like that is about killing every infected bird and all of those in an area around it to try and stop the disease spreading." New Zealand was extremely lucky because of its geographically isolated position which had kept the virus out so far, he said. "But I think we can't get complacent about this because we do have migratory birds that come down from the Northern Hemisphere and we have seabirds that migrate across the circum polar regions of the Southern Hemisphere and if those birds can bring it here then ... it only takes one infected bird to get established in a country." It has been said that if a bird got avian influenza it would be too sick to migrate, he said. The disease had a variable incubation period although generally the time between when the bird became infected and when it started to show symptoms was about a week, he said. Ornithologists have discovered that shore birds could migrate from Alaska down to New Zealand in as little as seven days, he said. A more likely risk was that the disease could leap-frog bird species to New Zealand, perhaps spreading from a species that moves through Europe, to one that moves into Australia and then into a species that moves across to New Zealand, Gartrell said. Seabirds, shore birds were being seen in this outbreak, with migratory water fowl a major way that the virus had been moving through Asia and Europe, he said. Although there were not any water fowl that migrated into New Zealand, if it came to this country via shore birds and then infected water fowl, ducks would spread it right around the country, he said. The disease could also potentially enter the country via smuggled eggs, he said. The key was to stop it getting here in the first place, he said. MPI response In a statement, the Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) chief veterinary officer Mary van Andel said it was continually monitoring the situation overseas and New Zealand had never had a case of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza. The risk of it arriving was still considered low and there were systems in place to ensure early detection if it were to arrive, she said. That included summer surveillance programmes which screened ducks close to migratory bird sites and liaising with wildlife hospitals and Poultry Industry Association vets. "Biosecurity New Zealand works closely with the Department of Conservation (DOC) in preparedness and awareness within New Zealand and on avian influenza screening kits. These kits would be deployed by DOC to sub-Antarctic Islands if an unusual mortality event was detected," she said. Gartrell agreed that MPI was doing good work, but said he would like to see them doing more surveillance "at that front line" by going out and sampling shore birds and seabirds. The public should notify any mass bird deaths or strange behaviour to MPI's Exotic Pest and Disease Hotline - 0800 80 99 66. Gartrell said migratory birds would now start to come in to New Zealand after the breeding season in Alaska and the Northern Hemisphere. Anyone working with the birds on the shoreline who noticed unusual deaths should be very proactive about calling the hotline as quickly as possible, he said. What if it did get here? The Ministry for Primary Industries said if highly pathogenic avian influenza was detected, Biosecurity New Zealand would be the lead agency to coordinate any response. "Any actions such as movement control, vaccination or culling, would depend on the extent of the detection and whether it is found in wild birds, zoo/sanctuary/pet birds or poultry," van Andel said. Gartrell said if the disease arrived in New Zealand, based on overseas experience, the most likely approach would be to try and cull any infected birds and any birds that posed a risk of further spreading the infection. There was no clarity on what a mass cull of infected birds would mean for wildlife populations, including endangered birds, he said. There would be some extremely difficult decisions to make if the disease did arrive, and decisions would need to be made very quickly to stop the virus becoming established in the country, Gartrell said.

After a case of avian influenza was confirmed here on Friday, 18 November, the Zoo Berlin management immediately initiated quarantine measures. One of those measures was to close the entire Zoo grounds to visitors. The process also began of taking samples from all the birds kept at Zoo Berlin. Now that almost all the test results have been analysed, Germany’s oldest zoo can give an initial assessment of the current situation. The good news is that no other positive cases were detected in the first round of testing. However, Zoo Berlin will remain closed for the time being.Initially, tests were conducted on all the birds (86) that had been in direct contact with the infected hamerkop that died. After that, the birds that had been in indirect contact were tested (235). Next, samples were taken from all the remaining birds. The first round of testing has not yet revealed any further cases of avian influenza, but the final results are still pending. Additional rounds of testing will be required before conclusions can be drawn about the source of the infection and what further steps to take. Article 12(1.a) of EU Commission Delegated Regulation 2020/687 rules that when a positive case of avian influenza is established “all animals of listed species kept in the affected establishment shall be killed as soon as possible.” At Zoo Berlin, that wouldn’t just mean the chickens, geese and ducks, but also more exotic species like the African penguins, James’s flamingos and hyacinth macaws. “For now, we are just pleased that the infected hamerkop appears to have been an isolated case,” says Zoo and Tierpark Director Dr Andreas Knieriem. But he stressed the seriousness of the Zoo’s situation, explaining that “current EU legislation leaves us with little room for manoeuvre. Before we can address the topic of reopening, we have to focus on averting a very real disaster for our birds and the Zoo as a whole. We are currently working flat out to try to gain an exemption for the unique collection of birds at Zoo Berlin.” Among the 1,200 feathered inhabitants are many species that are critically endangered or at risk of extinction, such as the kagu, Vietnamese pheasant, North Island brown kiwi, southern rockhopper penguin and the Bali myna. These birds are all part of European Endangered Species Programmes and form important reserve populations. Zoo Berlin also breeds various birds for reintroduction into the wild, including the bearded vulture, northern bald ibis, and ferruginous duck. The loss of these birds at Zoo Berlin would therefore constitute a severe blow to conservation efforts. Avian influenza is a highly contagious viral disease. It primarily spreads through direct contact but can also be transmitted indirectly, for example via contaminated footwear, clothing, or animal bedding and nesting material. Most bird species – especially domestic turkeys and chickens – are susceptible to infection, but the disease rarely occurs in wild birds. “Of course, bird flu is a problem we have long been aware of, but this is the first-ever case among our own collection and still came as a great shock,” says Zoological Director Christian Kern. “In previous years, we moved our birds to their indoor habitats as soon as a case was discovered in the vicinity of the Zoo.” In February and March of this year, 26 cases of avian flu were recorded among wild birds found dead in Berlin. But this is the first detected case this winter in Berlin or the surrounding state of Brandenburg. “Our top priority must be to prevent the spread of the disease to other bird populations,” says Dr Torsten Nöldner, spokesman for animal welfare with the Senate Department for the Environment, Mobility, Consumer Protection and Climate Action. The disease control measures put in place by the veterinary and food supervisory authority of the Berlin Mitte district include:Zoo Berlin will remain closed to visitors until further notice. The Zoo is currently only accessible to authorised personnel whose presence is required, for example, to feed and take care of the animals. The staff members looking after the birds at Zoo Berlin have received comprehensive training and are wearing protective clothing to prevent the spread of the disease. All birds are being kept indoors and no animals are permitted to enter or leave the Zoo at the current time.A risk analysis has been initiated of the overall situation at Zoo Berlin. An epidemiologist from the Friedrich Löffler Institute (Federal Research Institute for Animal Health) and other external experts are on hand to advise the Zoo Berlin team. All the birds are being tested regularly. Maria Elena Kaschubat, a veterinarian with the local authority has confirmed that “the official measures put in place should minimise the spread of the disease, stop susceptible animals being put at risk, and quickly get the situation under control. It is in everyone’s interest that each and every detail is adhered to with the utmost care and discipline.” It will only be possible to ease the restrictions if the further tests on all Zoo Berlin’s birds reveal no more positive cases. It currently seems likely that the Zoo will have to remain closed until the end of the year. However, any further positive test results would lead to a reassessment of the situation. Both the Aquarium and the Tierpark remain open.Background With the spread of avian influenza across Central Europe in recent years, some time ago Zoo and Tierpark Berlin began randomly testing deceased birds for the disease, also known as avian flu or bird flu. A hamerkop that died at Zoo Berlin on 13 November was shown to have been carrying the virus. Extensive quarantine measures were immediately introduced, and almost all the birds at the Zoo were moved into their indoor habitats or aviaries. To date, global instances of humans and other types of animals becoming infected with the H5N1 virus have been rare and isolated. However, there is a risk of introducing the virus into other bird populations. In consultation with the local authorities, Zoo Berlin will therefore remain closed to visitors until further notice.Direct help for Zoo Berlin Coming hot on the heels of the Covid-19 pandemic, the energy crisis, and the rising cost of animal feed, the outbreak of bird flu is one more problem in a series of challenges that Zoo Berlin has faced in the past couple of years. The team is working tirelessly to cope with the situation and ensure all its animals are fed and well cared for. As a non-profit organization, Zoo Berlin relies on entrance fees and donations and would therefore be very grateful for any support during these difficult times: https://www.zoo-berlin.de/en/donate/donations Tip: Animal sponsorships and ticket vouchers make great gifts that bring Christmas cheer to both the lucky recipients and the Zoo’s animals.

Fever is much more complicated in people that were infected by Covid. Experts point out that their lungs have a much lesser ability to withstand the influenza virus. In 26 days, 2.52 lakh people came to government hospitals alone due to fever. 72,640 people arrived within a week. Malappuram and Kannur are the districts that are the most affected. There were 14 fever related deaths in the state this year. Influenza virus infects the throat, nose and lungs. Symptoms include prolonged coughing and shortness of breath. Influenza A and B variants are present in Kerala. This was confirmed when the samples were tested at the Virology Institute. Those who come with such symptoms are tested for Covid only in emergency situations. If it is negative, no other tests are done as it is not life-threatening. Fever up to 104 degrees Previously, children had high fevers of 100 degrees. Doctors say the average fever is now 104 degrees. Paracetamol injection does not relieve fever. High-strength paracetamol should be given as a drip. 'Influenza can be very difficult even for those who have suffered minor lung damage due to Covid.' - Dr. Padmanabha Shenoy Rheumatologist, Kochi Mask should be used strictly.

I’m not, but I work in public health, so that’s hardly surprising. But I have some good news for anyone who doesn’t want to talk about COVID-19 vaccines, shots, jabs, etc.: I’m here to talk about flu vaccines, shots, jabs, etc. Yes, it’s time to revisit the classic influenza vaccine. Every year a new flu vaccine appears, and every year only about 40% of Canadians 12 years and over get their flu shot. Or at least that’s how many did in 2020-21. There are many different reasons why people don’t get immunized. For me, it was usually because I would forget to go every week until the flu season finally ended. However, this year I remembered, and I had five reasons for doing so: Reason 1: I don’t usually get that sick from the flu… and I want to keep it that way. All things considered, I’m fairly healthy. I could eat more vegetables, but I don’t have chronic illnesses and I’m relatively young. It’s not shocking that my encounters with the flu haven’t been very serious. As the Canadian Paediatric Society says, “Most healthy people recover from the flu without any serious problems.” Emphasis on most. Considering that the more serious complications can include pneumonia, heart attacks, and death, I would like to boost those odds. The flu vaccine, which is proven to reduce the number of doctor visits, hospitalizations, and deaths related to the flu, does just that. Reason 2: There are a lot of people I care about who ARE at higher risk from the flu. Besides protecting myself, the flu vaccine also helps protect the people around me. It’s simple: if I’m less likely to get the flu, then I’m less likely to pass it on to others. I’m surrounded by people who are at higher risk of serious complications from the flu than I am: my 71-year-old father, who is a cancer survivor. My nephew, who is just over a year old. My co-worker who is expecting a baby. I decided to get my flu shot to reduce my risk of unintentionally making any of them sick. Reason 3: The flu shot won’t protect me from COVID-19, but it can help protect our health care system. Our flu season has started earlier and we’re seeing more cases than normal. The health care system is struggling to keep pace, especially for the youngest patients. With COVID-19 and RSV also circulating and our health care system stretched to capacity, the flu shot just made sense. If the vaccine stops me from getting the flu or getting seriously ill, that means more health care resources for things like broken arms, sick kids, and people with bad COVID-19 infections. Reason 4: The flu vaccine WON’T give me the flu. The flu vaccines provided in Ontario this year are all inactivated vaccines. That means the virus proteins are dead. Donezo. Deceased. Dead virus proteins can’t replicate, so they can’t give me the flu. I was confident getting my shot knowing there was no way it could make me sick… though it did give me a slightly sore arm. Many people also briefly experience flu-like symptoms, such as chills and a headache, after getting vaccinated. However, these are normal side effects, generally last about 24 hours, and they’re a good sign that your immune system is responding to the vaccine and building protective antibodies! Reason 5: It was really easy to get vaccinated. I have a bit of an advantage here; my job had a clinic right in the workplace. However, even if you don’t work with several nurses, it’s still easy to get your flu shot. Many health care providers are prepared to give the flu vaccine to their patients (just call yours and ask), it is widely available at pharmacies, and public clinics are being organized across the TBDHU area. In fact, to further increase access to the flu vaccine, all TBDHU COVID Vaccine Clinics in Thunder Bay are now offering the flu vaccine to anyone 6 months and older on a walk-in basis. If you need your COVID-19 booster as well, you can even get both at the same time! Additional details about how and where to get vaccinated are shared on the TBDHU website. My apologies for sneaking the COVID-19 vaccine back in there. I hope you can forgive me… and I hope that one or two of these reasons will help you make a date to get the flu shot this year.

File | Photo Credit: SURESH ALLEPPEY Avian flu outbreak has been confirmed at two more places in Alappuzha. Officials of the Animal Husbandry Department (AHD) said the disease had been detected in ducks at Purakkad and chicken at Karuvatta. “Rapid Response Teams (RRT) of the AHD will cull around 9,300 ducks belonging to a farmer at Purakkad on Wednesday. Besides, domesticated birds within a one-km radius of the hotspot will be destroyed. At Karuvatta, the outbreak has been detected at a poultry farm. The entire bird stock there has succumbed to the disease. At least one RRT and other AHD officials will visit Karuvatta,” said an official. Following the mass death of birds at two places, the AHD sent samples of dead birds to the National Institute of High-Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD), Bhopal, for analysis, which tested positive for avian influenza.Avian influenza (H5N1) has so far been detected at five places in four local bodies in Alappuzha. The disease was first confirmed in ducks at Vazhuthanam in Haripad municipality on October 26. Later the outbreak was detected in Cheruthana and Karuvatta grama panchayats on November 4 and 12 respectively. In view of the fresh bout of the bird flu outbreak in the district, District Collector V.R. Krishna Teja on Tuesday issued an order banning the movement, sale and use of duck, chicken, quail, and other domestic birds, their egg, meat and waste (manure) in Amabalapuzha South, Pallippad, Karthikappally, Edathua, Thakazhi, Veeyapuram, Cheruthana, Karuvatta, Kumarapuram, Thrikkunnapuzha, Purakkad, Ambalapuzha North, Nedumudi, Champakulam and Ramankary grama panchayats and Haripad municipality till December 4.

Representative image KOLKATA: A spate of viruses has laid thousands of Kolkatans low with Covid-like symptoms such as fever, persistent cough, body ache, diarrhoea and lung infection. The sudden temperature fluctuation over the last one week has triggered the viruses that may remain active for a fortnight more, say doctors. While a few people are tested for viruses once Covid has been ruled out, most of the people have been struck by the common ones that turn active at this time of the year, say experts.An addition to the symptoms this time has been an obstinate cough, forcing doctors to prescribe antibiotics.Rhino virus, human meta-pneumo virus, adeno virus and influenza viruses have seen a major spurt, said doctors who pointed out that it is difficult to identify a virus unless a test is done. But very few, they said, have tested positive for Covid. "The symptoms this time are close to Covid, though none have tested positive at our hospital over the last fortnight. Some children were detected with adeno virus that has symptoms close to Covid. In some cases, it infiltrates the lungs and could turn serious. Most others have been struck by rhino and the variants of influenza that have been causing fever for four-five days," said Peerless Hospital microbiologist, Bhaskar Narayan Chowdhury.A significant number of fever patients are suffering from an upper respiratory tract infection, said Fortis Hospital's internal medicine consultant Joydeep Ghosh. "Fever accompanied by a severe cough has been the most common symptoms so far. Rather than the fever, it is the cough that is refusing to go, forcing us to prescribe antibiotics. While Covid has not been detected, the symptoms are close to it and leaving patients worried," he said.Mild fever and severe cough have been the common symptoms this season, according to RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) intensivist, Sauren Panja. "Upper respiratory tract infection, triggered by rhino virus and the variants of the influenza virus, has been striking frequently over the last one week. Temperature fluctuation is a reason for it helps viruses multiply. Indiscriminate use of antibiotics has been leading to loose motion after the fever is subsiding," said Panja.Internal medicine consultant, Arindam Biswas, said, "Paracetamol and anti-allergic drugs, if necessary, should be used." Some of the cases have been very severe, indicating a mutated version of influenza, he added. The common viruses trigger similar symptoms that recede in three-five days, according to Panja. Those aged above 65 and below 12 are susceptible to bacterial infections while suffering from viral fever. "A subsidiary infection could be dangerous unless it is detected early and treated with antibiotics. Many people have required hospitalization to tide over the crisis period," said paediatrician Shantanu Ray.End of ArticleFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA Visual Stories Previous9 most unique and rare birds in the worldLifestyle10 foods that contain highest protein per 100 gramsLifestyle8 Indian cities where non-vegetarian food is bannedFoodHow to make South-Indian style Chicken PakoraFood10 lines from Shakespeare's sonnets that are profound life lessonsLifestyleMost beautiful hill stations in the Western Ghats for a serene vacationtravel8 yoga poses that can reduce waist size effectivelyLifestyle7 home remedies to remove yellow stains from teethLifestyle10 books that will help transform your life in the next 3 monthsLifestyleGanesh Chaturthi 2024: 10 South Indian dishes to make for Lord GaneshaFood Next123Hot PicksIllia YefimchykArvind Kejriwal BailAnnapurna Interactive Staffs ResignedEx-Miss Switzerland FinalistHaitian ImmigrantsStock Market TodayDelhi Greater Kailash shootingTOP TRENDINGVande MetroHamster Kombat Daily Cipher CodesNarayana MurthyGarena Free Fire Max Redeem CodesOsama Bin Laden SonDonald TrumpAadhar Card UpdateIndia vs Pakistan Asian Champions TrophyLargest Mammals in the WorldPatrick MahomesTrending StoriesIn CityEntire Website'We were treated like slaves, made to work for 15 hours a day': Tricked into Ukraine war, 3 from Karnataka return home'My father was on the flight': Jaishankar opens up about 1984 Air India hijackAirtel CEO Gopal Vittal sends letter to Reliance Jio, Vodafone-Idea, Tata Tele and BSNL CEOs; here's what he saidPrince Harry to celebrate 40th birthday away from Meghan MarkleHaitian immigrant pet-eating row: Ohio woman accused of eating cat is US citizen, video is not from SpringfieldKejriwal out of jail; 'CBI arrest only to frustrate ED case bail': SC judgeDonald Trump reveals what Laura Loomer is to his campaign: 'I don't control her'Hamster Kombat Daily Cipher Codes and Combo Cards for September 14, 2024: Unlock up to 1 million coinsLaura Loomer's photo with Donald Trump viral.

Photo: RTHK Health authorities said on Wednesday that plans are in place to cope with the upcoming winter flu surge – as public hospitals brace for the challenges from both the influenza and Covid-19. Maria Leung, Chief of Service for the Hospital Authority's Department of Family Medicine, told RTHK that the consequences of a possible influenza outbreak will be more severe than before, as people in the SAR are less immune. “Over the last two years there wasn't any winter surge, which means the majority of the public – if they didn't have the influenza vaccination, they probably have no antibodies against the influenza virus,” she said. Leung added that travellers may also bring influenza viruses to the territory. The authority's Chief Manager, Michael Wong, told reporters that the HA has already allocated over $790 million to prepare hospital clusters for the anticipated demand surge. Wong stressed that authorities have prepared for the winter flu surge by bringing in more beds and healthcare staff. He noted that the HA is currently formulating a plan to deploy experienced staff at Covid-19 infection control centres to relieve pressure on hospitals.
