CDC and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommend that health care personnel (HCP) receive an annual influenza vaccination to reduce influenza-related morbidity and mortality. What is added by this report? HCP working in acute care hospitals during the 2017–2023 influenza seasons were less likely to be vaccinated against influenza during the COVID-19 pandemic (influenza seasons 2020–21 through 2022–23) than before the pandemic (influenza seasons 2017–18 through 2019–20). What are the implications for public health practice? Efforts are needed to implement evidence-based strategies to increase vaccination coverage among HCP. HCP should receive seasonal influenza vaccines to protect other HCP and patients from influenza-related morbidity and mortality.

Every year, acute care hospitals report receipt of influenza vaccination among HCP to CDC’s National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). This analysis used NHSN data to describe changes in influenza vaccination coverage among HCP in acute care hospitals before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Influenza vaccination among HCP increased during the prepandemic period from 88.6% during 2017–18 to 90.7% during 2019–20. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the percentage of HCP vaccinated against influenza decreased to 85.9% in 2020–21 and 81.1% in 2022–23. Additional efforts are needed to implement evidence-based strategies to increase vaccination coverage among HCP and to identify factors associated with recent declines in influenza vaccination coverage. Top Introduction Health care personnel (HCP), including those working in acute care hospitals, are at risk for becoming infected with influenza, missing work due to illness, and transmitting the virus to their patients and to other staff members (1). The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends that HCP receive an annual influenza vaccine to reduce influenza-associated morbidity and mortality (2). In 2013, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) began requiring acute care hospitals to report aggregate facility-level data on HCP influenza vaccination to CDC’s National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) (3). This analysis used data reported to NHSN to assess annual variation in influenza vaccination coverage among HCP during six influenza seasons (2017–18 through 2022–23) to describe annual changes in influenza vaccination coverage among HCP before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Top Methods Data Collection Since 2013, every year, acute care hospitals report aggregate facility-level influenza vaccination data among HCP working in the facility for ≥1 day during October 1–March 31 to NHSN.* During the 2019–20 influenza season, CMS suspended the NHSN reporting requirement to reduce regulatory workload during the COVID-19 pandemic,† making reporting optional during this season. This report includes data submitted by acute care hospitals to NHSN for the six influenza seasons from 2017–18 to 2022–23. Data Analysis For each influenza season, both pooled HCP influenza vaccination coverage (calculated by dividing the number of HCP who received the annual influenza vaccine by the total number of HCP among all reporting facilities) and facility-level coverage (calculated by dividing the reported number of HCP who worked at a specific facility and received the annual influenza vaccine by the total number of HCP who worked at the facility) were examined. A logistic regression model with generalized estimating equations was developed to assess differences in influenza vaccination coverage before the COVID-19 pandemic (prepandemic) and during the pandemic, controlling for HCP type (employee [those receiving a paycheck directly from the health care facility], nonemployee licensed practitioner [physicians, advanced practice nurses, and physician assistants who are affiliated with the health care facility, but are not directly employed by it], and nonemployee students and volunteer [medical, nursing, or other health professional students, interns, medical residents, or volunteers aged ≥18 years who are affiliated with the health care facility but are not directly employed by it]),§ three levels of urbanicity of the hospital location (urban, suburban, and rural),¶ and the six influenza seasons (2017–18 through 2022–23). The prepandemic period included influenza seasons 2017–18 through 2019–20, and the pandemic period included seasons 2020–21 through 2022–23, with the 2017–18 season set as the reference season. The 2019–20 season was included with the prepandemic seasons because influenza vaccination is generally recommended by the end of October,** and most influenza vaccines are administered by January.†† Thus, because widespread community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States did not begin until March 2020 (4), the pandemic is unlikely to have affected influenza vaccination during that season. In considering job category, the reference group was set as employee; for urbanicity, the reference group was rural. Descriptive analyses were performed at the facility level, with median coverage levels and IQRs calculated by season. Pooled facility-level vaccination coverage was further stratified by each factor included in the generalized estimating equations model, and odds ratios (OR) and 95% CI were calculated. P-values <0.05 and 95% CI that excluded 1 were considered statistically significant. All analysis was conducted using SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute). This activity was reviewed by the CDC, deemed not research, and conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.§§ Top Results During the 2017–18 through 2022–23 influenza seasons, 5,231 acute care hospitals reported HCP influenza vaccination data to NHSN (Table 1), including 2,908 (55.6%) hospitals during the 2019–20 season, when reporting was optional. During the six-season period, overall pooled influenza vaccination coverage among HCP was 85.8%. During the prepandemic influenza seasons (2017–18, 2018–19, and 2019–20), pooled annual influenza vaccination coverage was 88.6%, 90%, and 90.7%, respectively. After the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, coverage during the 2020–21, 2021–22, and 2022–23 seasons declined to 85.9%, 80.4%, and 81.1%, respectively. When controlled for HCP type and urbanicity, HCP were significantly less likely to be vaccinated against influenza during the pandemic than they were during the 2017–18 season, (Table 2). Across all influenza seasons, compared with HCP employed by hospitals, influenza vaccination coverage was lower among licensed independent practitioners (OR = 0.35; 95% CI = 0.34–0.37) and student trainees and volunteers (OR = 0.98; 95% CI = 0.81–0.98). Compared with HCP working in rural areas, HCP working in suburban areas were more likely to be vaccinated (OR = 1.16; 95% CI = 1.05–1.28). Top Discussion This study of a large national surveillance system found that influenza vaccination coverage among HCP in acute care hospitals has declined since the COVID-19 pandemic. A recent study reported similar results from an Internet panel survey of HCP in which estimated influenza vaccination coverage based on self-reported receipt of influenza vaccine decreased between the 2019–20 and the 2020–21 seasons (5). These findings underscore the importance of investigating reasons for declines in vaccination coverage among HCP. A combination of factors might have affected the decline in influenza vaccination coverage among HCP during the COVID-19 pandemic. Similar decreases in influenza vaccination observed among HCP in other countries have been attributed to COVID-19 vaccination campaigns leading to decreased emphasis on influenza vaccination and vaccine fatigue from having received multiple COVID-19 vaccines (6). Although the co-administration of COVID-19 and influenza vaccines is safe and effective,¶¶ individual hesitancy to receive both vaccines at once might also have contributed to lower influenza vaccination coverage during the pandemic. In the United States, facility-wide mask-wearing was recommended by CDC during the pandemic,*** and fewer influenza cases, hospitalizations, and deaths were reported during the 2020–21 and 2021–22 influenza seasons compared with previous years.††† These factors might have contributed to perceptions that the risk for acquiring influenza in the workplace was lower and that influenza vaccination was less important than it had been in previous years. Similar to reports from previous influenza seasons, nonemployee licensed independent practitioners were consistently found to have lower vaccination coverage compared with employees.§§§ Personnel directly employed by a hospital might be more easily reached by strategies to increase vaccination, such as offering vaccination at no cost, eliminating an important barrier to access. In addition, facility-issued vaccine mandates have been found to improve HCP influenza vaccination coverage (7). However, facility-level vaccination mandates might not be easily enforced among nonemployee licensed independent practitioners, potentially limiting the effectiveness of this strategy in this subpopulation of HCP. Previous reports of HCP vaccination have found that HCP working in rural areas had lower vaccination coverage compared with those working in nonrural areas (8). This report found that, compared with influenza vaccination coverage among HCP working in rural areas, influenza vaccination coverage among those working in suburban areas was significantly higher. There was no difference in coverage among HCP working in urban and rural areas. This suggests that future studies of vaccination coverage might consider examining HCP working in suburban and urban areas as separate subgroups. Limitations The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, this report includes influenza vaccination data reported by facilities to NHSN on behalf of HCP, which could have resulted in an underestimate of influenza vaccination acquired by HCP outside the hospital, particularly among HCP not employed directly by the reporting hospital. Second, NHSN received aggregate facility-level data; therefore, vaccination coverage could not be stratified by person-level covariates including age, race, or ethnicity. Third, a reporting exception was granted for acute care hospitals for the 2019–2020 season, resulting in only a subset of facilities reporting and limiting the generalizability of the data reported that year. Finally, NHSN does not collect data about facility-level influenza vaccination mandates for HCP. Therefore, it was not possible to determine the impact that facility-level vaccination mandates or changes to mandates over time might have had on influenza vaccination coverage among HCP. Implications for Public Health Practice Receipt of an annual influenza vaccination by HCP working in acute care hospitals is important for protecting themselves and hospitalized patients from influenza infection and its associated complications. Acute care hospitals can use evidence-based strategies to increase vaccination coverage, including implementing mandatory immunization policies and offering on-site influenza vaccination at no cost to all employee and nonemployee staff members.¶¶¶ Understanding factors contributing to recent declines in influenza vaccination among HCP might facilitate targeted interventions to increase influenza vaccination coverage during future public health emergencies.

Pyroptosis is a lytic and pro-inflammatory form of cell death executed by the pore-forming protein gasdermin D (GSDMD). In this study, we investigated a potential role for GSDMD in promoting the development of severe IAV disease. IAV infection resulted in cleavage of GSDMD in vivo and in vitro in lung epithelial cells. Mice genetically deficient in GSDMD (Gsdmd−/−) developed less severe IAV disease than wildtype mice and displayed improved survival outcomes. GSDMD deficiency significantly reduced neutrophil infiltration into the airways as well as the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF, IL-6, MCP-1, and IL-1α and neutrophil-attracting chemokines CXCL1 and CXCL2. In contrast, IL-1β and IL-18 responses were not largely impacted by GSDMD deficiency. In addition, Gsdmd−/− mice displayed significantly improved influenza disease resistance with reduced viral burden and less severe pulmonary pathology, including decreased epithelial damage and cell death. These findings indicate a major role for GSDMD in promoting damaging inflammation and the development of severe IAV disease.

Severe IAV infections are associated with excessive inflammation, cell death, and damage to the epithelium, which contribute to the development of untreatable and fatal lung disease [2, 3]. While the molecular mechanisms involved in the induction of inflammation during IAV infection have been extensively studied, the pathways involved in IAV-induced cell death and their impact on inflammation and immunopathology are less well described [2, 3]. A greater understanding of the role of cell death in host defense and disease pathogenesis may facilitate the design of new and effective host-directed therapies for severe IAV infections.NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasomes are cytosolic innate immune complexes that assemble during IAV infection in response to viral and endogenous cellular danger signals [2, 3]. These include pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs, e.g., viral RNA, IAV PB1-F2, and M2 proteins), as well as danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs, e.g., extracellular ATP and IL-1α) [4,5,6,7]. Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome complex, comprising NLRP3, ASC, and pro-caspase-1, induces proximity-mediated dimerization and activation of caspase-1 to process the inactive cytokines, pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18, into their bioactive, inflammatory forms, IL-1β and IL-18 [2]. Critically, we have previously shown the NLRP3 inflammasome and IL-1β can promote hyperinflammation in vivo and the development of severe IAV disease [7,8,9].NLRP3 inflammasome activation is known to typically result in pyroptosis, a lytic and pro-inflammatory form of cell death [3, 10]. Specifically, NLRP3 inflammasome activation induces caspase-1 cleavage of gasdermin D (GSDMD) between the autoinhibitory C-terminal and active N-terminal (NT) domains (at Asp 276 in mice and Asp 275 in humans) [11]. Active NT GSDMD p30 subunits insert into the lipid membrane and oligomerize to form a transmembrane pore [10, 12]. The GSDMD pore has been shown to facilitate the release of active pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18 from macrophages and dendritic cells [13, 14]. Ultimately, GSDMD pore formation leads to osmotic cell lysis and the release of inflammatory cellular contents, including DAMPs and PAMPs. Interestingly, Corry et al. detected cleaved GSDMD in the lungs of macaques infected with lethal avian H5N1 IAV [15], suggesting IAV infection induces GSDMD activation. While GSDMD has been shown to play a key role in numerous inflammatory diseases [10], its role in modulating inflammation and the severity of IAV disease in vivo is not currently well understood.In this study, we investigated a potential role for GSDMD in modulating the severity of IAV infection. Here we show that IAV infection induced GSDMD cleavage in vivo in murine lung epithelial cells and in vitro in human bronchial epithelial cells. Additionally, genetic deficiency of GSDMD limited the severity of IAV disease and improved survival and recovery from infection, which correlated with reduced lung viral burden, as well as diminished neutrophil infiltration and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF, IL-6, MCP-1, and IL-1α in the airways. Finally, mice lacking GSDMD displayed reduced pulmonary pathology, including epithelial damage and cell death. Collectively, our data provides evidence that GSDMD plays a major role in augmenting cell death and hyperinflammation at the site of infection, thereby promoting severe IAV disease.Materials and methodsInfluenza virusIAV strains used were HKx31 (H3N2), which is a high-yielding reassortant of A/PR/8 that carries the surface glycoproteins of A/Aichi/2/1968 (H3N2). In some in vitro experiments, human influenza strains A/Brazil/11/78 (BR; H1N1), A/Solomon Island/3/2006 (SI; H1N1), A/Tasmania/2004/2009 (Tas; pandemic H1N1), and A/Perth/16/2009 (Perth; H3N2) were used. IAV were grown in 10-day embryonated chicken eggs by standard procedures and titrated on Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells. All viral stocks were stored at −80 °C.In vitro IAV infectionHuman normal bronchial epithelial HBEC3-KT cells (immortalized and non-malignant) were purchased from ATCC (Virginia, USA) and cultured under submerged conditions on collagen-coated flasks (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA) in supplemented bronchial epithelial growth medium (BEGM; Lonza, Basel, Switzerland). HBEC3-KT cells were plated into collagen-coated 24-well plates in BEGM medium without hydrocortisone. The following day, cell monolayers were infected with IAV in BEGM media for 1 hr at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 3. Cell monolayers were then washed and incubated in media for 24 h. Cell supernatants and cell lysates were collected and stored at −80 °C for protein analysis via immunoblot. Cell supernatants were assayed for levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) using a CytoTox 96 Non-radioactive Cytotoxicity Assay (Promega, Madison, USA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Levels of IL-1β and IL-18 in cell supernatants were determined by ELISA (R&D Systems, USA).Influenza virus infection of miceWildtype and Gsdmd−/− C57BL/6N mice (male and female, 6–8 weeks old) were maintained in the Specific Pathogen Free Physical Containment Level 2 (PC2) Animal Research Facility at the Monash Medical Centre (Clayton, Victoria, Australia). Gsdmd−/− mice were kindly provided by VM Dixit (Genentech, South San Francisco, California, USA) [16]. All experimental procedures were approved by the Hudson Animal Ethics Committee, and experimental procedures were carried out in accordance with approved guidelines.For virus infection studies, cages of mice were randomly allocated to groups. Mice were lightly anesthetized with isoflurane, and intranasally inoculated with 104 plaque-forming units (PFU) of HKx31 (H3N2) IAV in 50 µL PBS, which induces severe disease [17]. Mice were weighed daily and assessed for clinical signs of disease on a scale of 0 to 3 (0 = no visible signs; 1 = slight ruffling of fur; 2 = ruffled fur, reduced mobility; 3 = ruffled fur, reduced mobility, rapid breathing). Animals that lost 20% of their original body weight and/or displayed severe clinical signs of disease (a score of 3) were euthanized.At the indicated time points, mice were sacrificed via intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was immediately performed by flushing the lungs three times with 1 mL of PBS. Lung tissues were then removed and frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen. Titres of infectious virus in lung homogenates were determined by standard plaque assay on MDCK cells. In some experiments, whole lung tissues (i.e., no BAL was performed) were excised from mice and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen for protein analysis.Examination of protein expression by immunoblotWhole lung tissues were homogenized in lysis buffer consisting of 250 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 10% (w/v) SDS, 20% (v/v) glycerol, supplemented with cOmplete™ Protease Inhibitor (Roche, Basel Switzerland). Protein estimation was used for whole lung samples to normalize protein loading (Bio-Rad DC Protein Assay, Bio-Rad, Hercules, California, USA). Proteins from mouse BAL cells and human HBEC3-KT cell lysates were isolated with RIPA buffer consisting of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% (v/v) Igepal, 0.5% (w/v) Sodium Deoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 10 mM Sodium Fluoride, 1 mM Sodium Orthovanadate, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri, USA). Protein lysates from HBEC3-KT cell supernatants and mouse BAL fluids were concentrated using Strataclean resin (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, California, USA).Protein lysates were resolved by 4–12% SDS-PAGE (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, California, USA) and transferred onto PVDF (Merck Millipore, Burlington, Massachusetts, USA). Membranes were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma Aldrich) in Tris-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST; Sigma Aldrich) followed by incubation with the desired primary antibodies overnight: anti-mouse Gsdmd (EPR19828; Abcam, Cambridge, UK), anti-human GSDMD (G7422, Sigma Aldrich), anti-human caspase 1 (D7F10; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, Massachusetts, USA), anti-mouse IL-1β (clone 30311; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, USA), or anti-mouse alpha tubulin (clone YL1/2; Abcam). Membranes were subsequently probed with the appropriate secondary antibodies and visualized on the Bio-Rad ChemiDoc MP Imaging System (Bio-Rad) via chemiluminescence (human and mouse GSDMD, caspase 1) or fluorescence (IL-1β and alpha tubulin). All original western blots are included in the Supplemental Material.Quantification of cytokines and chemokines in mouse BAL fluidBAL fluid was collected following centrifugation and stored at −80 °C. Levels of IL-6, MCP-1, IFNγ, IL-10, IL-12p70, and TNF proteins were determined by cytokine bead array (CBA) using the mouse inflammation kit (BD Biosciences, San Jose California, USA). Mouse IL-1β, IL-18, IL-1α, KC, and MIP-2 were quantified by ELISA (R&D Systems). Levels of IFNβ and IFNα were measured by ELISA as previously described [18].Flow cytometry on mouse BAL cellsCells in the BAL fluid were isolated by centrifugation and treated with red blood cell lysis buffer (Sigma Aldrich) for 5 min. The reaction was quenched by washing the cells in FACS buffer (PBS containing 2% (v/v) FBS and 2 mM EDTA). BAL cells were then incubated with fluorescently labeled antibodies at 4 °C for 20 min in the presence of Fc receptor blocking monoclonal antibodies against CD16/CD32 (clone 93, Thermo Fisher Scientific) to limit non-specific antibody binding. Specifically, monoclonal antibodies to Siglec-F (clone E50-2440, BD Biosciences), NK1.1 (clone PK136, BioLegend, San Diego, California, USA), CD3ε (clone 145-2C11, BioLegend), CD11c (clone HL3, BD Biosciences), CD64 (clone X54-5/7.1, BioLegend), Ly6C (clone AL-21, BD Biosciences), Ly6G (clone 1A8, BD Biosciences), and I-Ab (clone AF6-120.1, BD Biosciences) and the Zombie Aqua viability dye (BioLegend). Total live cells (Zombie Aqua viability dye-), neutrophils (Ly6G+ Ly6Cint), NK cells (NK1.1+ CD3−), T cells (NK1.1− CD3+), IM (Ly6G− Ly6C+), AM (CD11c+ Siglec-F+) and DCs (CD11c+ I-Ab+) were quantified by flow cytometry using a BD LSRFortessa™ X-20 (BD Biosciences) or Aurora flow cytometer (Cytek Biosciences, Fremont, California, USA) and FlowJo™ 10 analysis software (BD Biosciences). Cells were enumerated using a standard amount of blank calibration particles (ProSciTech, Kirwan, Queensland, Australia) as determined using a hemocytometer [17].For flow cytometric analysis of cell death and phenotype, BAL cells were treated with Fc receptor-blocking monoclonal antibody against CD16/CD32 (clone 93, Thermo Fisher Scientific) to limit non-specific antibody binding, followed by staining with fluorochrome-conjugated monoclonal antibodies as above. In some experiments, monoclonal antibodies to CD11b (clone M1/70, BioLegend) and CD69 (clone H1.2F3, BD Biosciences) were also included. Cells were then incubated with Annexin V (BioLegend) in binding buffer (10 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, and 2.5 mM CaCl2) and 5 µg mL−1 propidium iodide (PI; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cells were analyzed using a BD LSRFortessa™ X-20 (BD Biosciences) or Aurora flow cytometer (Cytek Biosciences, Fremont, California, USA) and FlowJo software (BD Biosciences).Immunofluorescence and immunohistochemical staining of lung tissue sectionsIn the indicated experiments, mice were sacrificed via intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital, and lungs were immediately inflated and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin (NBF) for at least 24 h, and then processed in paraffin wax. Longitudinal lung tissue sections (4 µm) were dewaxed and rehydrated, then microwaved for 6 mins in citrate buffer (10 mM citrate, pH 6) for heat-induced antigen retrieval. Lung sections were incubated in CAS-Block Histochemical Reagent (Thermo Fisher) for 1 hr and then incubated overnight with primary antibodies against cleaved Gsdmd (E3E3P, Cell Signaling Technology) and E-Cadherin (AF648SP, R&D Systems). Sections were then stained with anti-goat and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Thermo) for 1 h followed by Hoechst 33342 nuclear staining (Thermo Fisher). Sections were mounted using Fluorescence Mounting Medium (Agilent, Santa Clara, USA). Slides were examined under a Nikon A1R confocal microscope (Nikon, Japan). Confocal imaging was performed at 40× magnification and images were processed using ImageJ (National Institute of Health, USA). The % of Hoechst+ cells that were positive for cleaved GSDMD per field of view (FOV) was quantified using ImageJ software.In the indicated experiments, Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUDP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay was performed on lung tissue sections using the ApopTag Peroxidase In Situ Apoptosis Detection Kit (Merck Millipore), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. Lung sections were viewed on an Olympus BX60 microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) and photographed at 10× magnification with an Olympus DP74 color camera using Olympus cellSens Dimension software. TUNEL staining intensity (% positive pixel intensity per FOV) was quantified using ImageJ software. Color deconvolution was performed, and a threshold was set on DAB intensity, with the same parameters applied to all sections. Five random fields per section were analyzed.Assessment of lung damage and pathologyLevels of protein in BAL fluid supernatant were determined using a PierceTM BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA). Levels of LDH in BAL fluids were determined using a CytoTox 96 Non-radioactive Cytotoxicity Assay (Promega, Madison, USA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.In the indicated experiments, mice were sacrificed via intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital, and lungs were immediately inflated and fixed in 10% NBF for at least 24 h, and then processed in paraffin wax. Longitudinal tissue sections (4 µm) were prepared and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Tissues were graded for alveolitis and peribronchial inflammation on a subjective scale of 0 to 5 (0 = no inflammation, 1 = very mild, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, 4 = marked, and 5 = severe inflammation) [17, 19]. Sections were also scored for features of epithelial damage such as presence of debris in the airspace, epithelial denudation, and thickening of the epithelial wall (0 = no obvious damage, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = marked, and 4 = severe) [17]. Sections were blinded and randomized, and samples corresponding to the least severe and most severe were assigned scores of 0 and 4/5, respectively. All other samples were graded in 5 random fields by two independent readers. Lung sections were viewed on an Olympus BX60 microscope and photographed at 10x magnification with an Olympus DP74 color camera using Olympus cellSens Dimension software.Data and statistical analysisSample sizes were estimated based on previous extensive experience in the laboratory within similar studies. The investigator was blinded to the group allocation for the assessment of histology but was not blinded for other experiments. No samples were excluded from analysis. Data were tested for normality and analyzed by GraphPad Prism version 9 software (Graphstats Technologies, Bangalore, India). A Student’s t test (two-tailed unpaired) was used when comparing two values. When comparing three or more sets of values, a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used with either Tukey’s or Dunnett’s multiple comparisons post-hoc test. Survival proportions were compared using the Mantel-Cox log-rank test. A P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. No samples were excluded from analysis.ResultsIAV infection promotes GSDMD cleavage in lung epithelial cellsGSDMD cleavage or activation is a hallmark feature of pyroptosis. To examine cleavage of GSDMD in vivo during IAV infection, we utilized a well-established preclinical model of severe IAV infection [7,8,9, 17]. Wildtype and Gsdmd−/− mice were intranasally infected with 104 PFU of HKx31 H3N2 IAV. Gsdmd−/− mice [16] were kindly provided by Vishva Dixit (Genentech USA). Whole lung tissue lysates from IAV infected mice were evaluated for GSDMD expression and cleavage by immunoblot and compared against uninfected counterparts. IAV infection resulted in increased expression of full-length GSDMD on days 3 and 5 (Fig. 1A). Critically, the cleaved active N-terminal p30 subunit of GSDMD was detectable in lung tissues on day 3 and 5, suggesting IAV infection promotes GSDMD cleavage in the lung. Interestingly, full-length GSDMD was detectable in BAL cell lysates on day 3 (predominantly macrophages and neutrophils [9, 17]); however, the active N-terminal p30 subunit of GSDMD was not detected (Fig. S1), suggesting that during IAV infection GSDMD cleavage in airway leukocytes is limited in vivo. As lung epithelial cells represent the major site of IAV infection and replication [20], we next examined the expression of cleaved GSDMD in lung tissue sections by confocal imaging (Fig. 1B, C, S2). E-cadherin+ epithelial cells lining the bronchioles and alveoli expressed cleaved GSDMD on day 3 post-infection, suggesting GSDMD is activated in lung epithelial cells in vivo during IAV infection. The % of cells positive for cleaved GSDMD trended lower on day 5 (Fig. 1C). Importantly, expression of cleaved GSDMD was not observed in lung tissues from Gsdmd−/− mice (Fig. S2). Lastly, in vitro infection of normal human bronchial epithelial (HBEC-3KT) cells with human H1N1 and H3N2 IAV resulted in GSDMD cleavage, with active p30 and inactive p43 subunits of GSDMD detected in cell supernatants at 24 h following infection (Fig. 1D). Caspase 1 is a well-described activator of GSDMD and consistent with this, the active p20 subunit of caspase 1 was detected in human epithelial cells following IAV infection (Fig. 1D). Lastly, IAV infection was associated with the release of LDH (Fig. 1E), IL-1β (Fig. 1F) and IL-18 (Fig. 1G) in cell supernatants. Together, these data demonstrate IAV infection promotes activation of GSDMD in murine and human lung epithelial cells.Fig. 1: IAV infection results in cleavage of GSDMD in lung epithelial cells.A, B Wildtype and Gsdmd−/− mice were infected with 104 PFU of HKx31 IAV.

Wildtype and Gsdmd−/− mice were infected with 104 PFU of HKx31 (H3N2) IAV and monitored daily for weight loss and clinical signs of disease (score of 0-3, as described in the Materials and Methods). Mice were euthanized either upon losing greater than 20% of their initial body weight or displaying severe clinical signs of disease (score of 3). By day 6 post-infection, all wildtype mice had developed severe IAV disease characterized by 20% weight loss (Fig. 2A), reduced mobility, and rapid breathing (disease score of 3; Fig. 2B) and were subsequently euthanized (Fig. 2C). In contrast, Gsdmd−/− mice developed less severe IAV disease as seen by reduced clinical disease scores (scores of 1–2; Fig. 2B). Critically, 75% of Gsdmd−/− mice recovered from the infection by day 10 post-infection (Fig. 2C). These results suggest GSDMD deficiency promotes resistance to severe IAV infection.Fig. 2: GSDMD deficiency limits the severity of IAV infection.Wildtype and Gsdmd−/− mice were infected with 104 PFU of HKx31 as a model of severe IAV infection. n = 8 per group, pooled from two independent experiments.

B Mice were scored daily for clinical signs of disease on a scale of 0–3, as described in the Materials and methods. Results are expressed as mean disease score ± SD. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, two-tailed unpaired Student’s t test. C Survival curves are shown. **p < 0.01, Mantel–Cox log-rank test.Full size imageGSDMD deficiency limits neutrophil infiltration into the airways during IAV infectionIAV infection induces the rapid infiltration of immune cells into the airways. The magnitude and nature of the cellular infiltrates may be critical factors contributing to morbidity and mortality during IAV infection. Having established that Gsdmd−/− mice are more resistant to developing severe IAV disease (Fig. 2), we enumerated cellular infiltrates in BAL fluids at days 3 and 5 post-infection using flow cytometry (Fig. 3A). Total airway cellularity and numbers of neutrophils, natural killer (NK) cells, inflammatory macrophages (IM), dendritic cells (DC), and resident alveolar macrophages (AM) were determined [17]. Compared with wildtype mice, total BAL leukocyte numbers were significantly reduced on day 3 and 5 in infected Gsdmd−/− mice (Fig. 3B). This correlated with a significant reduction in neutrophil numbers in the airways on day 3 and 5 post-infection (Fig. 3C). Resident AMs are susceptible to HKx31 IAV infection [20,21,22] and play an important protective role in vivo [21]. Consistent with our recent findings [17], IAV infection reduced AM numbers in the airways of wildtype mice on day 3 and 5 post-infection and a similar reduction was observed in the absence of GSDMD (Fig. 3D). Lastly, a trend for reduced IM numbers was seen on day 3 in the absence of GSDMD, with similar numbers of NK cells and DCs observed (Fig. 3E–G).Fig. 3: GSDMD deficiency limits the infiltration of neutrophils into the airways.Wildtype and Gsdmd−/− mice (n = 8) were infected with 104 PFU of HKx31 IAV and BAL performed on day 3 and 5 post-infection. Uninfected controls (n = 3 or 4) were included for comparison. A Representative flow cytometry gating strategy for BAL cells. B Numbers (#) of total live cells.

Data are presented as the mean ± SD, pooled from two independent experiments, with each data point representing an individual animal. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001, two-tailed unpaired Student’s t test.Full size imageWe next sought to correlate alterations in leukocyte numbers with possible changes in cell activation and/or cell death. A mild reduction in the surface expression of activation marker CD69 was seen on AMs in the airways of Gsdmd−/− mice (Fig. S3A); however, CD69 expression on IMs was comparable between wildtype and Gsdmd−/− cohorts (Fig. S3B). The reduced neutrophil numbers observed in Gsdmd−/− mice (Fig. 3C) was not associated with changes in surface expression of activation markers CD69, CD11b, and MHC Class II on neutrophils (Fig. S3C–E). Interestingly, Annexin V and PI staining revealed GSDMD deficiency was not associated with a reduction in the frequency of dying (Annexin V+ PI−) or dead (Annexin V+ PI+) AMs, IMs, or neutrophils in the airways (Fig. S2F–H). Together, these results suggest GSDMD plays a major role in promoting the infiltration of neutrophils into the airways.GSDMD deficiency constrains excessive pro-inflammatory mediator production in the airways during IAV infectionSevere and fatal IAV infections are characterized by dysregulated and excessive cytokine responses, also known as ‘cytokine storm’. We next examined levels of pro-inflammatory mediators in the airways of wildtype and Gsdmd−/− mice on days 3 and 5 following IAV infection. Levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, TNF, MCP-1, and IL-1α were all significantly reduced in Gsdmd−/− mice on day 3 (Fig. 4A–D), with MCP-1 levels additionally reduced on day 5 (Fig. 4A). By contrast, no significant differences were observed in levels of interferon beta (IFNβ), interferon alpha (IFNα), interferon gamma (IFNγ), IL-10, or IL-12p70 at either time point (Fig. S4A–E). Interestingly, levels of NLRP3-dependent cytokines IL-1β, and IL-18 in the BAL were not altered by GSDMD deficiency (Fig. 4E, F). Immunoblot analysis of lung tissue lysates (Fig. S4F) and BAL fluids (Fig. S4G) confirmed no defect in IL-1β responses in Gsdmd−/− mice, as expression of the mature IL-1β p17 subunit was comparable. Consistent with the observed reduction in neutrophil numbers in the BAL (Fig. 3C), neutrophil-attracting chemokines CXCL1 and CXCL2 were significantly reduced in BAL fluids from Gsdmd−/− mice (Fig. 4G, H). Collectively, these data demonstrate GSDMD promotes excessive pro-inflammatory mediator production in the airways.Fig. 4: GSDMD deficiency limits the production of pro-inflammatory mediators in the airways.Wildtype and Gsdmd−/− mice were infected with 104 PFU of HKx31 IAV and BAL performed on day 3 and 5 post-infection.

Lung infectious viral burden (pfu/lung) was significantly reduced at day 3 post-infection in mice lacking GSDMD, with a less profound reduction in viral loads observed at day 5 (Fig. 5A). Levels of LDH in BAL fluids were significantly lower in Gsdmd−/− mice (Fig. 5B), with a trend for reduced total protein concentrations (Fig. 5C), collectively suggestive of diminished pulmonary damage in the absence of GSDMD. Histopathological analysis of H&E-stained lung tissue sections (Fig. 5D) indicated that peribronchial inflammation, alveolitis, and epithelial damage were significantly diminished on day 3 in Gsdmd−/− mice (Fig. 5E–G). Lastly, TUNEL labeling revealed Gsdmd−/− mice displayed significantly reduced tissue and epithelial cell death (Fig. 5H, I) [23]. Together, these data demonstrate GSDMD promotes pulmonary viral dissemination, tissue damage and cell death during severe IAV infection.Fig. 5: GSDMD deficiency limits viral loads, epithelial cell death, and immunopathology.Wildtype and Gsdmd−/− mice were infected with 104 PFU of HKx31 IAV.

Seasonal IAV continue to cause yearly epidemics with considerable morbidity and mortality. Additionally, outbreaks of ‘bird flu’ have caused more than 2400 sporadic infections in humans, with an associated mortality rate of 40% [24, 25]. Current IAV antiviral drugs have shown limited efficacy [26], and without new effective and safe host-directed therapies, we will continue to be vulnerable to developing severe IAV disease.The severity of IAV disease may be dictated by the maintaining of a balance between rapid virus elimination and regulation of the immune response to limit immunopathology. Severe IAV infections in humans are characterized by excessive inflammatory responses, cell death, and damage to the epithelium, which leads to fatal acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)-like disease [2, 21, 27, 28]. While numerous studies have defined a critical role for apoptosis in limiting the severity of IAV infection (reviewed in [3]), here we report that GSDMD promotes epithelial cell death and excessive pulmonary inflammation, including the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the infiltration of neutrophils into the airways, leading to increased pulmonary damage and pathology.In the lung, resident AMs and epithelial cells lining the airways are the primary targets of IAV infection, with epithelial cells representing the major site of viral replication [20, 21, 29]. In general, cell death pathways, such as those involving apoptosis, are thought to interrupt the IAV replication cycle and limit virus amplification. Consistent with this, IAV infection of primary murine and human macrophages is described as ‘abortive’, in which viral proteins are expressed within the cell but infectious virus is not released [20, 21, 30]. Macrophages therefore provide a ‘dead end’ important for the control of IAV infection, with in vivo depletion increasing viral loads and exacerbating disease [21]. Of note, the PR8 H1N1 IAV strain was adapted to mouse lung by >300 sequential passages [31], and as such, it poorly infects murine macrophages [20, 21]. Conversely, the HKx31 H3N2 IAV used in our study and human seasonal H3N2 and H1N1 IAV are more efficient at infecting macrophages [18, 21, 30]. Here we observed IAV infection depleted AM numbers in the airways (Fig. 3D) and induced IM infiltration (Fig. 3F) in wildtype and Gsdmd−/− mice. Interestingly, we failed to detect cleaved GSDMD in BAL cell lysates from IAV-infected wildtype mice (Fig. S1), and GSDMD deficiency had limited impact on AM or IM cell death (Fig. S3F, S3G), which correlated with a similar abundance of these cell types in infected airways (Fig. 3D, F). Together, these data suggest that in the absence of GSDMD, macrophage cell death in vivo during IAV infection is largely unaltered. Conversely, IAV infection induced cleavage of GSDMD in vivo in lung epithelial cells (Fig. 1B and C) and in vitro in normal human bronchial epithelial cells (Fig. 1D). However, a limitation is the human bronchial epithelial cells were not grown in an air liquid interface and therefore more closely emulate basal cells rather than epithelial cells of the bronchus. In support of our findings, GSDMD cleavage has been reported in human precancerous respiratory epithelial cells (PL16T cells) following IAV infection [32]. Critically, in our study, mice lacking GSDMD displayed reduced epithelial cell damage (Fig. 5G) and death (Fig. 5H, I); key determinants of IAV-induced ARDS-like disease [27].IAV infection of epithelial cells and macrophages results in the rapid recruitment of leukocytes into the airways, predominantly IMs and neutrophils (Fig. 3). We observed no significant differences in numbers of IMs, NK cells, and DCs in the airways of wildtype and Gsdmd−/− mice following IAV infection. Interestingly, the rapid infiltration of neutrophils into the airways was significantly impaired in the absence of GSDMD (Fig. 3C). Notably, this was not associated with major alterations in neutrophil activation (Fig. S3C–E) or cell death (Fig. S3H) but rather a reduction in levels of neutrophil-attracting chemokines CXCL1 and CXCL2 (Fig. 4G, H), which are produced by IAV-infected epithelial cells [20]. We have previously shown potent and sustained antibody-mediated depletion of neutrophils prior to and throughout IAV infection increased viral burden and promoted the development of severe IAV-induced disease [19, 33]. However, treatment with 2 low doses of neutrophil-depleting antibodies has been shown to improve IAV infection outcomes in mice without altering viral burden [34]. As such, in contrast to complete depletion of neutrophils in the airways, limiting their numbers may be beneficial through a reduction in immunopathology. Consistent with Gsdmd−/− mice displaying improved resistance to severe IAV infection (Fig. 2), as well as the observed reduction rather than ablation of neutrophil infiltrates (Fig. 2C), limiting GSDMD activation during IAV infection may therefore fine-tune neutrophil responses in the airways.Cytokines play a critical role in mediating protective inflammation; however, excessive responses can promote cell death and tissue damage. In this study, the absence of GSDMD limited the production of several key pro-inflammatory mediators in the airways (Fig. 4), which correlated with increased resistance to infection, namely improved survival (Fig. 2), as well as reduced lung viral burden and pathology (Fig. 5). Critically, GSDMD-mediated cell death leads to cell lysis and the release of cellular contents, including PAMPs and DAMPs [35, 36], which have the potential to further promote inflammation via activation of toll-like receptors (TLRs) and the secretion of NFκB-dependent cytokines. Consistent with this, TNF, IL-6, and MCP-1, cytokines commonly associated with ‘cytokine storms’, were reduced in the airways of Gsdmd−/− mice (Fig. 4A-C). DAMPs released following GSDMD-mediated cell lysis are also well-described NLRP3 inflammasome activators, which could feed forward to exacerbate GSDMD-mediated cell death. Thus, during severe IAV infection, GSDMD activity may overamplify the local innate immune response, contributing to damaging immunopathology and compromising the health of the host.The GSDMD pore has also been shown to facilitate the release of NLRP3-dependent cytokines IL-1β and IL-18 from macrophages and dendritic cells [13, 14]. Interestingly, in vivo IL-1β and IL-18 responses were not altered in the absence of GSDMD (Fig. 4E, F, Fig. S4F, G). This observation may reflect a potential differential role for GSDMD in myeloid and epithelial cells and/or a potential role for GSDMD-independent release of IL-1β and IL-18 in vivo during IAV infection. More recently, GSDMD has been shown to promote the release of IL-1ɑ [37], which reportedly also supports neutrophil infiltration and promotes pulmonary damage during IAV infection [38]. Congruent with these findings, we observed reduced levels of IL-1ɑ in the airways of infected Gsdmd−/− mice (Fig. 4D). GSDMD deficiency may therefore rebalance innate immune responses to limit tissue damage without compromising critical protective host immunity.Together, our findings define a detrimental role for GSDMD in promoting damaging inflammation and the development of severe IAV disease. Critically, IAV infection induced GSDMD cleavage in lung epithelial cells with mice lacking GSDMD displaying reduced inflammatory cell death, viral burden, and damage to the epithelium. There is an urgent need to develop new treatment for respiratory viruses, particularly those with pandemic potential. Novel host-directed therapies that limit hyperinflammation-associated morbidity and mortality, a common feature of severe respiratory virus infections, are an increasingly attractive option compared to current IAV antivirals, which can lead to the emergence of drug resistant IAVs. As such, GSDMD may be a new candidate therapeutic target for treatment of influenza and to improve disease outcomes.

CDC and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommend that health care personnel (HCP) receive an annual influenza vaccine and stay up to date with recommended COVID-19 vaccination. What is added by this report? During the 2022–23 influenza season, influenza vaccination coverage was 81% among HCP at acute care hospitals and 47% among those at nursing homes. Up-to-date COVID-19 vaccination coverage was 17% among HCP at acute care hospitals and 23% among those at nursing homes. What are the implications for public health practice? There is a need to promote evidence-based strategies to improve vaccination coverage among HCP. Tailored strategies might be useful to reach all HCP with recommended vaccines to protect them and their patients from vaccine-preventable respiratory diseases. Article Metrics Altmetric: Citations: Views: Views equals page views plus PDF downloads Metric Details FigureTablesTable 1Table 2Related MaterialsArticle PDFFull Issue PDF Abstract The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends that health care personnel (HCP) receive an annual influenza vaccine and that everyone aged ≥6 months stay up to date with recommended COVID-19 vaccination. Health care facilities report vaccination of HCP against influenza and COVID-19 to CDC’s National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). During January–June 2023, NHSN defined up-to-date COVID-19 vaccination as receipt of a bivalent COVID-19 mRNA vaccine dose or completion of a primary series within the preceding 2 months. This analysis describes influenza and up-to-date COVID-19 vaccination coverage among HCP working in acute care hospitals and nursing homes during the 2022–23 influenza season (October 1, 2022–March 31, 2023). Influenza vaccination coverage was 81.0% among HCP at acute care hospitals and 47.1% among those working at nursing homes. Up-to-date COVID-19 vaccination coverage was 17.2% among HCP working at acute care hospitals and 22.8% among those working at nursing homes. There is a need to promote evidence-based strategies to improve vaccination coverage among HCP. Tailored strategies might also be useful to reach all HCP with recommended vaccines and protect them and their patients from vaccine-preventable respiratory diseases. Top Introduction Vaccination of health care personnel (HCP) is a critical strategy to minimize transmission of infection in health care settings (1,2). HCP are at high risk for work-related exposure to viruses such as influenza and SARS-CoV-2 but are less likely to transmit these infections when they are vaccinated (3). The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that HCP receive an annual influenza vaccine (4). ACIP also recommends that persons aged ≥6 months stay up to date with recommended COVID-19 vaccination.† The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) monitors the implementation of these recommendations by requiring health care facilities such as nursing homes and acute care hospitals to report influenza§ and COVID-19¶ vaccination coverage among HCP** to CDC’s National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). This study examined influenza and up-to-date COVID-19 vaccination coverage among HCP working in acute care hospitals and nursing homes during the 2022–23 influenza season. Top Methods Data Collection Acute care hospitals and nursing homes report data to NHSN according to surveillance protocols for influenza and COVID-19 vaccination. Acute care hospitals and nursing homes began reporting COVID-19 vaccination among HCP in 2021; nursing homes were required to report influenza vaccination among HCP for the first time during the 2022–23 influenza season.†† To assess influenza vaccination coverage, facilities are required to report an annual count of HCP working in the facility for ≥1 day during an influenza season (October 1–March 31)§§ and the number of HCP who 1) received influenza vaccination, 2) had a medical contraindication to influenza vaccination, 3) declined vaccination, and 4) had unknown vaccination status. The protocol for COVID-19 vaccination coverage includes parallel data fields for COVID-19; however, data collection occurs at a different cadence. Nursing homes and acute care facilities report on schedules mandated by their respective regulatory programs at CMS. Nursing homes submit COVID-19 vaccination coverage weekly¶¶; acute care facilities submit ≥1 week of data per month.*** Both types of facilities report COVID-19 vaccination coverage data among HCP who were eligible to work in the facility ≥1 day during the reporting week. Data Analysis To assess HCP vaccination coverage during the 2022–23 influenza season, analyses were conducted using influenza and up-to-date COVID-19 coverage data (specifically, up-to-date COVID-19 coverage data from the week ending March 26, 2023, or the last submitted week of data) reported to NHSN. NHSN defined up-to-date COVID-19 vaccination as the receipt of a bivalent booster dose or completion of a primary series within the previous 2 months (i.e., not yet eligible to receive a bivalent vaccine).††† Facilities reporting data for both vaccine types and employing at least five HCP were included in the analysis. Pooled mean influenza and up-to-date COVID-19 vaccination coverage rates were calculated as the number of HCP who had received each recommended vaccine or vaccination series divided by the number of HCP working in all facilities. HCP reported to have a medical contraindication to COVID-19 vaccination were subtracted from the denominator of the up-to-date COVID-19 vaccination coverage calculation, to align with the measure adopted by CMS’s quality reporting programs.§§§ Coverage with each vaccine was calculated for HCP working at each facility type (nursing home or acute care hospital). Results were further stratified by employment category (employee, licensed practitioner, and student or volunteer); rural-urban classification (rural or urban)¶¶¶; county-level social vulnerability index (SVI) tertile****; facility size tertile††††; state; and U.S. region.§§§§ Counties in a lower SVI tertile are less socially vulnerable than are those in an upper SVI tertile. All analyses were conducted using SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute).

Among HCP working in acute care hospitals, influenza vaccination coverage was highest in the Midwest (84.7%) and lowest in the Pacific region (74.4%). Among approximately 2.0 million HCP working in 13,794 nursing homes, influenza vaccination coverage was 47.1% overall; coverage was lowest among employees (46.1%) and substantially higher among nonemployee licensed practitioners (55.3%) and nonemployee students and volunteers (57.7%). Among HCP working in nursing homes, influenza vaccination coverage was highest in the Pacific region (61.1%) and lowest in the South (39.7%). Influenza vaccination coverage among HCP was similar across facility size, urban-rural status, and SVI for both nursing homes and acute care hospitals. Nursing homes in six states reported influenza vaccination coverage of ≥75% among HCP, whereas this level of coverage was reported in acute care hospitals in 40 states (Figure) (Supplementary Table, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/134928). Up-to-Date COVID-19 Vaccination Coverage Among approximately 7.7 million HCP working in 4,057 acute care hospitals, up-to-date COVID-19 vaccination coverage was 17.2% overall (Table 2) and was highest in the Pacific region (28.9%) and lowest in the Mountain region (9.1%). No substantial differences by staff member type or urbanicity were observed. Among approximately 1.6 million HCP working at 13,794 nursing homes, up-to-date COVID-19 vaccination coverage was 22.8% overall; coverage was highest among nonemployee licensed practitioners (28.2%) and lowest among employees (22.4%). Among HCP working in nursing homes, up-to-date COVID-19 vaccination coverage was highest among those working in the Pacific region (40.7%) and lowest among those working in the South (17.5%). Up-to-date COVID-19 vaccination was also substantially higher among HCP working at nursing homes in urban (24.2%) than in rural (17.5%) areas. No substantial differences in COVID-19 vaccination coverage among HCP by facility staff size or SVI were observed at either facility type. Up-to-date COVID-19 vaccination coverage was ≥20% among HCP working in nursing homes in 30 states but among HCP in acute care hospitals, approximately one half as many states (16) achieved this level of coverage (Supplementary Table, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/134928). Top Discussion During the 2022–23 influenza season, fewer than one quarter of HCP working in acute care hospitals and nursing homes were up to date with recommended COVID-19 vaccination, and fewer than one half of HCP working in nursing homes had received influenza vaccine. Coverage varied by geographic region, health care facility type, employment category, and urbanicity. Recent reports indicate that influenza and COVID-19 vaccination coverage among HCP has declined during the COVID-19 pandemic (5). During the 2017–18 and 2018–19 influenza seasons, influenza vaccination coverage among HCP in acute care hospitals was 88.6% and 90.0%, respectively (6). From November 2021 to June 2023, CMS required all HCP at CMS-certified facilities to be vaccinated for COVID-19*****; this requirement likely contributed to COVID-19 primary series vaccination coverage reaching 94.3% among HCP in nursing homes (7) and 91.2% among those at acute care hospitals (5). The current findings suggest that factors associated with low vaccination coverage might have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and compounded by emerging concerns such as vaccine fatigue (8) and other as yet unidentified factors. In this analysis, up-to-date COVID-19 vaccination coverage was higher among HCP working in nursing homes than among those working in acute care hospitals. CMS requires nursing homes to report weekly up-to-date COVID-19 vaccination status among HCP and publishes weekly results on a public-facing website†††††; this might have resulted in higher coverage among HCP in nursing homes. CDC also worked with nursing homes to facilitate access to vaccination for both patients and staff members,§§§§§ which might have also improved coverage. This report identified low up-to-date COVID-19 vaccination coverage among HCP in both acute care hospitals and nursing homes and low influenza vaccination coverage among HCP in nursing homes, both important threats to patient health and safety that need to be addressed. Implementation of vaccination recommendations for HCP has been a long-standing challenge for the public health and health care sectors. In an effort to improve vaccination coverage among HCP, health care facilities and federal and state governments have implemented interventions including jurisdiction-wide and facility-wide vaccination mandates (7,9). Mandates for HCP to receive influenza vaccination have been in place since before the COVID-19 pandemic and might contribute to the high vaccination rates reported to NHSN. However, such mandates might not be easily enforceable among nonemployee HCP in acute care hospitals, among whom coverage with both vaccines was lower than that among employees. Compared to influenza vaccines, COVID-19 vaccines are newer, and availability can be more sporadic; therefore, facilities do not have as much experience promoting vaccination and might not have the ability to conduct mass vaccination events. This might have contributed to lower COVID-19 vaccination coverage. Further, given the variations in vaccination coverage by region and urbanicity, campaign strategies tailored by region and focusing on rural areas might have the potential to increase vaccination coverage. Limitations The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, influenza vaccination and up-to-date COVID-19 vaccination coverage rates were reported separately using different definitions of total HCP working within the facility. Whether the same personnel are represented in seasonal influenza vaccination coverage counts and weekly COVID-19 vaccination counts is unknown. This nuance limits the direct comparability of coverage with the two vaccines; therefore, statistical comparisons of vaccination coverage were not conducted. Second, this report includes data reported by facilities on behalf of HCP, which could have resulted in underestimates of vaccination acquired outside the health care facility, particularly by HCP not employed directly by the reporting facility. Third, vaccination coverage could not be stratified by recent history of SARS-CoV-2 infection. CDC recommendations state that persons may consider delaying an updated vaccine by 3 months after infection. Therefore, some persons might not have considered themselves eligible for vaccination, leading to an underestimate of COVID-19 vaccination coverage. Finally, this analysis was conducted using aggregate data reported to NHSN at the facility level. Therefore, vaccination coverage could not be stratified by person-level covariates that might have enabled an assessment of potential differences, such as age, race, and ethnicity. Implications for Public Health Practice Closely monitoring influenza and up-to-date COVID-19 vaccination coverage among HCP might help facilitate evaluation of effective implementation of vaccination promotion strategies.¶¶¶¶¶ Studies are needed to identify additional factors associated with low vaccination coverage and approaches to improve coverage among HCP, with particular attention to geographic region, health care facility type, and employment category. Understanding these factors and promoting evidence-based strategies to increase vaccination coverage among HCP, such as making vaccines free and accessible at work (10), might allow for targeted interventions to improve coverage during future respiratory virus seasons. HCP should receive annual influenza vaccines and remain up to date with recommended COVID-19 vaccination to protect themselves and their patients from vaccine-preventable diseases.

Those who are 0 to 19 years old have been most affected, with more than 13,600 cases reported in that population, Mellado said.Health officials said there were plenty of vaccines, tests and treatments available on the island. Hoy decretamos epidemia de la influenza tras registrarse un aumento sostenido de casos, hospitalizaciones y fatalidades en toda la isla de personas infectadas con el virus. El llamado es a unirse a las medidas de prevención para hacerle frente a la propagación de este virus. pic.twitter.com/oJKZ5zyYiK— Carlos Mellado López (@prsecsalud) November 9, 2023 A record 53,708 influenza cases were reported in 2015 in Puerto Rico. The island has struggled with a deteriorating health care system, which experts say was worsened by Hurricane Maria in 2017 and Hurricane Fiona last September. As of last year, about half of the people living in Puerto Rico depend on the public health care system. Local officials have blamed federal funding gaps for causing staff shortages and long wait times for patients. In an interview last year, Nelson Varas-Diaz, a researcher at Florida International University who oversees studies assessing the state of health care on the island, pointed to debt as a reason for the collapse."The collapse is caused mainly by debt and the economic crisis in Puerto Rico and historic privatization of the health care system there," Varas-Diaz told "CBS Mornings" lead national correspondent David Begnaud in Sept. 2022. "Our research shows patients are waiting for six to eight months to get an appointment with a specialist. If that's not a sign of collapse, I don't know what is."

We previously developed a subunit vaccine antigen consisting of a stabilized trimeric influenza A group 1 hemagglutinin (H1) stem protein that elicits broadly neutralizing antibodies. Here, we further optimized the stability and manufacturability of the H1 stem antigen (H1 stem v2, also known as INFLUENZA G1 mHA) and characterized its formulation and potency with different adjuvants in vitro and in animal models. The recombinant H1 stem antigen (50 µg) was administered to influenza-naïve non-human primates either with aluminum hydroxide [Al(OH)3] + NaCl, AS01B, or SLA-LSQ formulations at week 0, 8 and 34. These SLA-LSQ formulations comprised of varying ratios of the synthetic TLR4 agonist ‘second generation synthetic lipid adjuvant’ (SLA) with liposomal QS-21 (LSQ). A vaccine formulation with aluminum hydroxide or SLA-LSQ (starting at a 10:25 µg ratio) induced HA-specific antibodies and breadth of neutralization against a panel of influenza A group 1 pseudoviruses, comparable with vaccine formulated with AS01B, four weeks after the second immunization. A formulation with SLA-LSQ in a 5:2 μg ratio contained larger fused or aggregated liposomes and induced significantly lower humoral responses. Broadly HA stem-binding antibodies were detectable for the entire period after the second vaccine dose up to week 34, after which they were boosted by a third vaccine dose. These findings inform about potential adjuvant formulations in clinical trials with an H1 stem-based vaccine candidate.

Influenza is estimated to cause 3–5 million cases of severe illness and is responsible for 290,000 to 650,000 deaths annually worldwide (pre-COVID-19 pandemic)2. Vaccination is considered to be one of the most cost-effective health interventions to prevent influenza3. Current influenza vaccines may need to be updated annually as influenza viruses continue to evolve by acquiring mutations that enable it to evade protection by previous infections or vaccination. These seasonal influenza vaccines predominantly protect against strains closely related to the strains the vaccine is based on, but provide little protection against other influenza strains or subtypes4,5. The identification of broadly protective neutralizing antibodies fueled the development of a class of universal or broadly protective influenza vaccines, targeting conserved epitopes in the haemagglutinin (HA) protein6. As these broadly protective antibodies are predominantly directed to the highly conserved stem region of HA, we developed a subunit protein vaccine consisting of a stabilized trimeric influenza A group 1 HA (H1) stem without the immune-dominant HA head domain7. Vaccination with this H1 stem protein protected against challenge with heterosubtypic influenza A group 1 challenge in mice and in non-human primates (NHP) when administered with aluminum salts7,8,9.Adjuvants are thought to contribute to a better quality of the HA stem-specific immune response by increased recruitment of (memory) B cells and follicular T helper cells10,11. We therefore set out to further improve the immunogenicity of H1 stem by screening and optimizing various adjuvant formulations. Although aluminum salts induce humoral responses and are among the most widely used adjuvants, alternative adjuvants have been developed that induce superior antibody levels compared to aluminum salts12,13. AS01B was developed to elicit strong cellular and humoral responses12,14 and is included in the herpes zoster (Shingrix) vaccine15,16. AS01B consists of a saponin fraction (QS-21)17 and the toll-like receptor 4 agonist (TLR4) 3-O-desacyl-4′- monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL®) that is purified from Salmonella minnesota, in a liposomal formulation18. MPL® is a heterogeneous mixture of congeneric lipid A with 4′-phophoryl groups and varying numbers of acyl chains with hexa- and penta-acylated species reported to be TLR4 agonists, while tetra- and tri-acylated species are human TLR4 antagonists19. As MPL® is also believed to be responsible for the local injection site pain observed in human vaccinees20, careful titration of the adjuvant components is required to achieve similar levels of immunogenicity compared with AS01B, while potentially reducing the reactogenicity following vaccination in humans. Further development of adjuvant components has led to a second-generation synthetic lipid adjuvant (SLA) TLR4 agonist, which is a hexa-acylated structure, to further improve the binding affinity to human TLR4 and improve its adjuvanting properties21,22. In this study, we evaluated the immunogenicity of H1 stem formulated with different doses of SLA and QS-21 in a liposomal formulation (SLA-LSQ)23 in NHP, in comparison with AS01B.ResultsDesign and in vitro characterization of H1 stem antigensTo increase protein stability and manufacturability, two additional point mutations were introduced to the original H1 stem design7 (referred to as H1 stem v1) to obtain a H1 stem v2 design. An important region of instability in influenza A HA is the second pH-sensitive switch at the bend of the central helix D to helix E24. The negatively charged Glu434 at this interface was substituted with the neutral Gln, stabilizing this switch region in the trimer interface by neutralizing the repulsion and optimizing the interaction with the 30-loop. Previously, residues at several positions in the B-loop were successfully optimized to generate a stable soluble stem-based immunogen7. Position 392 in the B-loop of the current construct was further explored for optimization by substitutions to the charged Arg or to a Pro which is known to potentially stabilize the hinge region of class I fusion proteins25,26,27 (Fig. 1a). Supernatants of cells transfected with plasmids encoding H1 stem v1 and the improved H1 stem v2 design were tested for expression and trimer content (Fig. 1b). The two mutations increased the expression yields of trimeric H1 stem v2 by ∼5-5.7-fold and the percentage trimers by ∼2.7-3.2-fold, compared with H1 stem v1. Trimeric H1 stem v1 and H1 stem v2 were purified for further testing. The improved purified trimeric H1 stem v2 showed an increase in melting temperature (Tm50) up to 6.1 °C as determined by differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF), whereas antigenicity was maintained as confirmed by EC50 binding values (ELISA) in the lower nanomolar range as shown for monoclonal (CR911428 and CT14929) and multidomain (SD38-Fc30) antibodies (Fig. 1c). H1 stem v2 Y392R was selected as it had the highest melting temperature, while antigenicity was comparable between H1 stem v2 Y392P and Y392R. Next, we evaluated the protective efficacy of H1 stem v1 and -v2 (Y392R) designs in a lethal H1N1 A/Brisbane/59/2007 influenza challenge model. We observed comparable, significant protection by both H1 stem v1 and v2 compared to PBS, indicating that increased protein stability and manufacturability did not affect immunogenicity (Fig. 1d).Fig. 1: Characterization of H1 stem antigens.a Structure (top) and a schematic representation (below) of monomeric HA (PDB ID 4M4Y) and a model of monomeric H1 stem v2.

Animals vaccinated with PBS were included as a control (n = 11). Post-challenge survival until day 21 after challenge with 12.5xLD50 of H1N1 A/Brisbane/59/2007 at day 0 is shown. The median weight loss per groups is shown with the inter-quartile range. Statistical comparisons were performed using a 2-sided Fisher’s exact test. Significant differences in survival compared with the PBS group are indicated by asterisks: ***P < 0.001.Full size imageOptimization of the aluminum-based adjuvantsWe have previously shown that the H1 stem antigen is immunogenic in mice and NHP when administered with the salt aluminum hydroxide [Al(OH)3] diluted in PBS7,8,9. In addition to Al(OH)3, aluminum phosphate (AlPO4) is commonly used and has different biological and physicochemical properties31. Antigen adsorption to the adjuvant is thought to be one of the factors driving immunogenicity32. We found that less than 20% H1 stem v2 was bound to AlPO4, while antigen adsorption was highest to Al(OH)3 in a buffer containing 2% sucrose/ 10 mM Tris ( >90% bound) and 70-80% bound for Al(OH)3 diluted in PBS (Table 1). Art et al. reported that increasing the salt concentration increases Al(OH)3 particle aggregation32, which is thought to influence immunogenicity. Therefore, we also formulated H1 stem v2 in Al(OH)3 + 140 mM NaCl.Table 1 Characteristics of different aluminum salt-based adjuvant formulations.Full size tableTo evaluate which aluminum-based adjuvant maximized the immunogenicity of H1 stem v2, mice were vaccinated twice with three dose levels (0.1, 1 or 10 μg) of H1 stem v2 adjuvanted with 50 μg 2% AlPO4, Al(OH)3, Al(OH)3 + PBS or Al(OH)3 + NaCl. HA stem-binding antibody titers were highest across dose in mice immunized with H1 stem v2 adjuvanted with either Al(OH)3 + PBS or Al(OH)3 + NaCl (Fig. 2a), compared with AlPO4 and Al(OH)3. Subsequently, the mice received a lethal H5N1 A/Hong Kong/156/1997 influenza challenge to assess the breadth of protection, as H5N1 is a different subtype compared to the H1N1-derived H1 stem v2. In addition, H5N1 is of interest as it has pandemic potential in humans. While we did not observe protection in the AlPO4- and Al(OH)3-adjuvanted groups against a lethal challenge compared with the control-immunized group, mice immunized with an H1 stem v2 dose from 10 μg adjuvanted with Al(OH)3 + PBS and as low as 1 μg adjuvanted with Al(OH)3 + NaCl were significantly protected (Fig. 2b).Fig. 2: Formulation of Al(OH)3 + NaCl enhances the immunogenicity and efficacy of H1 stem v2 in mice.Mice were immunized with 0.1, 1 or 10 μg H1 stem v2 adjuvanted with 50 μg 2% AlPO4, Al(OH)3, Al(OH)3 + PBS or Al(OH)3 + NaCl twice on day −49 and −28 (n = 8 per dose). Animals vaccinated with PBS (n = 8) were included as a control. a HA stem specific binding antibody levels were measured at day −1 using a H1N1 A/California/07/09 full-length HA IgG-binding ELISA. Individual binding titers per animal are shown. Black horizontal bars indicate the group medians. b Survival proportions are shown post-challenge with 12.5xLD50 of H5N1 A/Hong Kong/156/1997 until day 21. Comparisons with the control group or across dose comparisons were performed using an ANOVA (a) or a 2-sided Fisher’s exact test (b) with a 4-fold Bonferroni-correction. Statistical differences compared with the control group are indicated with plus symbols: ++P < 0.01, +++P < 0.001 and statistical differences across dose are indicated by asterisks: *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.Full size imageIn vitro characterization of SLA-LSQ formulationsIt has recently been shown that levels of HA stem antibodies can be increased with the next generation adjuvants AS01B and AS0333. Therefore, we also aimed to evaluate the immunogenicity of H1 stem v2 adjuvanted with AS01B or SLA-LSQ, which consists of the synthetic TLR4 agonist SLA and a saponin fraction (QS-21) in a liposomal formulation. MPL®, which is part of AS01B, is a mixture of TLR4 agonists and antagonists19 and believed to be responsible for the local injection site pain observed in human vaccinees20. Therefore, careful titration of the adjuvant dose is required to achieve similar levels of immunogenicity compared with AS01B, while potentially reducing the reactogenicity following vaccination in humans.First, various analytical methods were applied to characterize the AS01B and SLA-LSQ vaccine formulations in vitro before and after mixing with H1 stem v2. We observed a higher absorbance at 350 nm in the 5:2 μg SLA-LSQ formulation (Fig. 3a), indicating an increase in turbidity (cloudiness). The average particle size as quantified using dynamic light scattering (Fig. 3b) and nanoparticle tracking analyses showed an increase in particle size (Fig. 3c). In addition, nanoparticle tracking revealed a reduced number of larger particles. All formulations had similar intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence (Fig. 3d), indicating that there is no interaction of the protein with the lipid bilayer of the liposomes or larger formed lipid-like structures. The H1 stem v2 protein therefore does not contribute to additional fusion or aggregation of the SLA-LSQ formulations. However, we observed a higher zeta potential in the 5:2 μg SLA-LSQ formulation (Fig. 3e) that may be responsible for the fusion/ aggregation of liposomes as there are less repulsive charges present. The presence of globular particles in the micrometer range in the 5:2 μg SLA-LSQ formulation were visualized by microscopy after Nile Red staining (Fig. 3f). When analyzing the formulation characteristics of adjuvants without antigen, 5:2 μg SLA-LSQ was also more turbid and contained larger particles before mixing with H1 stem v2, suggesting that these aggregates were not introduced upon mixing with H1 stem v2 (Supplemental Fig. 1a, b). Staining with Nile Red confirmed these findings as the 5:2 μg SLA-LSQ group showed reduced bulk fluorescence due to a reduced total surface area and clearly visible aggregates when visualized with microscopy (Supplemental Fig. 1c, d).Fig. 3: In vitro characterization of H1 stem v2 formulated with SLA-LSQ and AS01B.H1 stem v2 was formulated with SLA-LSQ containing SLA and QS-21 in a ratio of 5:2 μg, 10:25 μg, 25:25 μg or 50:50 μg or AS01B containing 50:50 μg MPL® and QS-21. a Absorption at 350 nm indicates the turbidity. b Average particle size was evaluated using dynamic light scattering (DLS) and c nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) in nm. The particle count was also evaluated using NTA in count/ mL. d Group means are shown ±standard deviation. The peak intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence was measured at 340 nm after excitation at 280 nm. e The zeta potential was measured using the zetasizer nano ZS. f The larger micrometer-size globular and hydrophobic structures were visualized by Nile Red staining. Red horizontal bars in (a), (b), (d) and (e) indicate the group medians. Scale bar indicates 100 μm.Full size imageHumoral responses after vaccination of cynomolgus monkeys with adjuvanted H1 stem HAMPL® contains tetra- and tri-acylated congeneric lipid A species that are TLR4 antagonists in humans19, but are agonists in mice19. Therefore, we evaluated the reactogenicity and immunogenicity of H1 stem v2 adjuvanted with SLA-LSQ in cynomolgus monkeys, as they have a similar TLR receptor distribution compared to humans34. Monkeys received a dose of H1 stem v2 on week 0 and week 8. Subsequently the animals received a dose at week 24 to evaluate amnestic responses. AS01B (containing 50:50 μg MPL® and QS-21) and Al(OH)3 + NaCl were included as reference adjuvants. Different doses of SLA-LSQ with a ratio of 5:2 μg, 10:25 μg, 25:25 μg or 50:50 μg SLA and QS-21 were included to evaluate if comparable immunogenicity to AS01B can be achieved at lower adjuvant doses. Local injection-site reactions were monitored using the Draize scoring system post immunization to assess skin reactogenicity. However, we did not observe edema and erythema at the injection site up to three days after the first two doses. Only minimal erythema was detected after the third dose in one animal that received H1 stem v2 adjuvanted with 25:25 μg SLA-LSQ and two animals that received Al(OH)3 + NaCl as an adjuvant.HA stem-binding antibodies were measured using a H1N1 A/California/07/2009 full-length HA IgG-binding ELISA (Fig. 4a). Although no statistical significant differences in mean binding-antibody titers were detected between the SLA-LSQ and Al(OH)3 + NaCl groups with AS01B 4 weeks post dose 1 (Fig. 4b), the number of animals with HA stem-binding antibodies above the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) appeared to be higher in the Al(OH)3 + NaCl adjuvanted group at this time point. Four weeks post dose 2 (study week 12), HA stem-binding antibodies were detected in all adjuvanted groups. HA IgG antibody-binding titers were not different between the Al(OH)3, the 50:50 μg SLA-LSQ and the AS01B group (Fig. 4c). However, binding antibody titers were lower in the groups adjuvanted with 5:2, 10:25 and 25:25 μg SLA-LSQ. The antibody titers gradually decreased over time after week 12, until the animals received a third dose at week 34 (Fig. 4a). At week 38, antibody titers were lower in the Al(OH)3 + NaCl-adjuvanted group, compared with the AS01B-adjuvanted group. However, 10:25 and 50:50 μg SLA-LSQ induced comparable binding-antibody titers with AS01B, while titers were lower in the 5:2 and the 25:25 μg SLA-LSQ groups (Fig. 4d).Fig. 4: Influenza haemagglutinin stem-specific binding antibodies after vaccination of NHPs with adjuvanted H1 stem protein.Influenza-seronegative cynomolgus macaques received either unadjuvanted H1 stem v2 or H1 stem v2 adjuvanted with SLA-LSQ containing SLA and QS-21 in a ratio of 5:2 μg, 10:25 μg, 25:25 μg or 50:50 μg, H1 stem v2 adjuvanted with AS01B containing 50:50 μg MPL® and QS-21 or Al(OH)3 + NaCl (N = 8-9) in a 3-dose immunization regimen on week 0, 8 and 34. a HA stem-specific binding antibody levels were measured at week −2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 34 and 38 using a H1N1 A/California/07/09 full-length HA IgG-binding ELISA. Median binding titers per group are shown and error bars denote the interquartile range (IQR). Individual binding titers per animal are shown for week (b) 4, (c) 12 and (d) 38. Red horizontal bars indicate the group medians and the dotted line indicates the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ). Open symbols indicate the response is at or below the LLOQ. Comparisons between the SLA-LSQ- and Al(OH)3 + NaCl-vaccine groups with the AS01B group were performed by a Wilcoxon rank sum test. Statistical differences are indicated by asterisks: *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001. Additional statistical comparisons are shown in Supplemental Tables 1–3.Full size imageComparable results were obtained with a H1N1 A/California/07/2009 HA stem IgG-binding ELISA (Supplemental Fig. 2a–c). Moreover, we measured HA stem-binding titers using this ELISA in a cohort of healthy human volunteers that received the seasonal trivalent influenza vaccine Inflexal V that included the influenza strains H1N1 A/California/07/2009, H3N2 A/Victoria/210/2009 and B/Brisbane/60/200835. The adult population generally has pre-existing HA stem binding antibodies from previous infections or vaccinations. Seasonal influenza vaccination led to an approximately 2-fold increase in HA stem binding antibodies titers in humans, but antibody titers were relatively low (Supplemental Fig. 2d). By contrast, we observed both higher HA stem binding antibody titer increases as well as higher absolute antibody levels after 3 doses of adjuvanted H1 stem v2 in NHPs compared with seasonal influenza vaccination in humans (Supplemental Fig. 2c). This suggests that vaccination with H1 stem v2 has the potential to increase HA stem antibody levels in humans as well.Influenza virus neutralization breadth was also evaluated at week 12 using a pseudovirus entry inhibition assay (pseudo-particle Virus Neutralization Assay, ppVNA), using pseudotyped retroviruses expressing a large panel of HA and NA Influenza A group 1 strains. Broad neutralization was observed, with neutralizing titers detected against most strains (Fig. 5a; see Supplemental Fig. 3 for individual results). We detected significantly lower neutralizing titers against all variants tested in animals that had received H1 stem v2 adjuvanted with 5:2 μg SLA-LSQ, compared with AS01B. The area under the curve (AUC) of breadth-potency plots was calculated to quantify the breadth of neutralization, which also showed a significantly lower AUC in the 5:2 μg SLA-LSQ group (Fig. 5b, c). No significant differences were found between the SLA-LSQ groups starting at 10:25 μg and the Al(OH)3 + NaCl-group, with AS01B.Fig. 5: Neutralizing breadth induced by vaccination of NHPs with adjuvanted H1 stem protein.Influenza-seronegative cynomolgus macaques received either unadjuvanted H1 stem v2 or H1 stem v2 adjuvanted with SLA-LSQ containing SLA and QS-21 in a ratio of 5:2 μg, 10:25 μg, 25:25 μg or 50:50 μg, H1 stem v2 adjuvanted with AS01B containing 50:50 μg MPL® and QS-21 or Al(OH)3 + NaCl (N = 8–9) on week 0 and 8. a Neutralizing antibody titers were measured using a ppVNA against a panel of influenza A group 1 virus strains at week 12 (4 weeks post dose 2). The median neutralizing titers per group are visualized in a heatmap using binned neutralization titers. b Breadth-potency curves of individual animals per group. Breadth denotes the neutralization coverage of the panel of ppVNA influenza strains as shown in (a). Red line represents the mean curve per group. c AUC of each breadth-potency curve as shown in (b). d ADCC was quantified using a H1N1 A/California/07/09 HA-specific hFcγRIIIa reporter assay at week 12. Endpoint titers are shown for individual animals. Red horizontal bars indicate the group medians and open symbols indicate the AUC for the breadth of neutralization is 0 or that ADCC was not detected. Comparisons between the SLA-LSQ- and Al(OH)3 + NaCl-vaccine groups with the AS01B group were performed by a Wilcoxon rank sum test. Statistical differences are indicated by asterisks: *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001. Additional statistical comparisons are shown in Supplemental Tables 4 and 5.Full size imageNon-neutralizing HA stem antibodies have also been shown to contribute to protection by ADCC of infected cells upon the interaction with FcγRIIIa on natural killer (NK) cells36,37. A reporter assay was used in which cells express luciferase upon binding of FcγRIIIa with the Fc of antigen-bound antibodies that correlates with functional ADCC assays38. 4 weeks post dose 2 (week 12), FcγRIIIa signaling was comparable in the groups that received 25:25 μg SLA-LSQ and AS01B. However, FcγRIIIa signaling was significantly lower in the 5:2, 10:25 and 50:50 μg SLA-LSQ groups (Fig. 5d). In addition, HA stem-binding antibodies partially correlated with the AUC for neutralization and ADCC titers (Supplemental Fig. 4).Cellular responses after vaccination of cynomolgus monkeys with adjuvanted H1 stem proteinT cell responses were also evaluated at week 10 (2 weeks post dose 2) and week 36 (2 weeks post dose 3) by intracellular cytokine staining after stimulation of PBMCs with either a full-length (FL)-HA or a HA stem peptide pool. Overall, we found low frequencies of CD4 and CD8 T-cells positive for IFN-γ, IL-2 or TNF- α, with the highest frequencies of cytokine-positive CD4 T-cells detected in the AS01B group both at week 10 and week 36 (Fig. 6, Supplemental Figs. 5–8).Fig. 6: CD4 responses induced by vaccination of NHPs with adjuvanted H1 stem protein.Influenza-seronegative cynomolgus macaques received either unadjuvanted H1 stem v2 or H1 stem v2 adjuvanted with SLA-LSQ containing SLA and QS-21 in a ratio of 5:2 μg, 10:25 μg, 25:25 μg or 50:50 μg, H1 stem v2 adjuvanted with AS01B containing 50:50 μg MPL® and QS-21 or Al(OH)3 + NaCl (N = 8–9) in a 3-dose immunization regimen on week 0, 8 and 34. CD4 T cell responses were analyzed with ICS at study week 10 (2 weeks post second immunization) and 36 (2 weeks post third immunization). The median frequency of CD4 + CD69+ T cells stimulated with full-length (FL)-HA or HA stem peptide pools expressing IFN-γ, IL-2 or TNF-α are shown after subtraction of the percent positive cells in the DMSO-stimulated (mock control) group. Single positive (SP), double positive (DP), triple positive (TP). Comparisons between the SLA-LSQ- and Al(OH)3 + NaCl-vaccines groups with the AS01B group were performed by a Wilcoxon rank sum test. Statistical differences are indicated by asterisks: *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001. Additional statistical comparisons are shown in Supplemental Tables 6–9. Responses in individual animals are shown in Supplemental Figs. 6, 7. Flow cytometry controls are shown in Supplemental Fig. 8.Full size imageIn addition, antigen-specific cytokine secretion was measured at week 36 using a multiplex assay. The standardized group means in cytokine-positive T-cell subsets as measured by ICS and cytokine/chemokine secretion by Luminex after stimulation with full-length HA and HA stem are shown. Overall, the highest fold change in cytokine-positive T-cells and secreted cytokines and chemokines was detected in the H1 stem v2 group adjuvanted with AS01B, showing a proinflammatory cytokine profile, similar to what has been observed before with AS01B in blood39 (Supplemental Fig. 9).DiscussionA broadly protective influenza vaccine is required to improve the protection against seasonal influenza and to provide protection against potentially pandemic influenza strains that may originate from avian and swine influenza viruses40. We developed a subunit vaccine consisting of a stabilized trimeric influenza A group 1 HA stem antigen7,8,9, capable of generating broadly neutralizing antibodies. We further improved the original H1 stem vaccine7 by incorporating two additional mutations (Y392P/R and E434Q), that increase its expression and trimer stability without affecting antigenicity and protective potency, resulting in H1 stem v2.We and others have previously shown that robust HA stem-specific antibody responses can be induced in naïve and pre-exposed NHP7,41,42,43,44, with increased antibody levels in the presence of adjuvants in naïve animals42,43. Although NHP lack the IGHV1-69 allele (prevalent in many human group 1 HA stem antibodies) or orthologs hereof, group 1, group 2 and cross-reactive HA stem-specific antibodies were efficiently induced in vaccinated NHPs showing alternative immunoglobulin encoding usages43,44, supporting the use of NHP in the evaluation of HA stem vaccines. Here, we evaluated the immunogenicity of H1 stem v2 with the adjuvants Al(OH)3 + NaCl, AS01B and SLA-LSQ. H1 stem v2 adjuvanted with AS01B and 50:50 μg SLA-LSQ (which both contain 50 μg QS-21 and 50 μg MPL® or SLA) induced comparable broadly protective HA stem binding and neutralizing antibody titers, which suggests that the bacterium-derived MPL® and the synthetic TLR4 agonist SLA have comparable adjuvanting properties in NHP. We did not directly evaluate the protective capacity of the H1 stem v2-induced antibodies in NHP. However, we have previously shown that H1 stem v1 antibodies induced in NHP can both directly protect against pandemic H1N1 challenge7 and indirectly after passive immunization of mice with serum from H1 stem v1-immunized NHP followed by H1N1 and H5N1 challenge9. Given that the protective capacity between the H1 stem v1 and the H1 stem v2 is highly similar in mice, in our opinion the protective capacity of the H1 stem v2-induced antibodies in NHP is also identical to H1 stem v1.Although the AS01B-adjuvanted herpes zoster (Shingrix) vaccine is highly effective15,16, the strong immunostimulatory properties are also linked to increased reactogenicity39, such as systemic and injection site reactions. For example, solicited or unsolicited severe grade 3 reactogenicity were reported for 10% of the herpes zoster (Shingrix) vaccine recipients15,16. Lower reactogenicity has been observed using a Respiratory Syncytial Virus Prefusion F protein adjuvanted with AS01E (25 μg MPL® and 25 μg QS-21), compared with AS01B (50 μg MPL® and 50 μg QS-21)45. Reducing the dose of SLA and QS-21 might therefore be an approach to reduce potential adjuvant-driven reactogenicity in humans. However, we did not detect local-injection site reactions using Draize scoring in NHPs with any of the adjuvant formulations, indicating that different readouts or animal models are needed to evaluate the local reactogenicity. It appears that a composite of biomarkers, in particular, IL-6, CRP, and for highly immunogenic products, the IFN-signalling pathway, are linked to systemic reactogenicity46. Although we did not measure these cytokines directly in whole blood, antigen-specific restimulation of PBMCs results in lower levels of those cytokines for the SLA-LSQ formulation compared to AS01B, suggesting that systemic reactogencity might be lower. A malaria vaccine with as little as 1 μg of the synthetic TLR4 agonist Glucopyranosyl Lipid Adjuvant (GLA) and 0.4 μg QS-21 in a liposomal formulation has been shown to be immunogenic in humans47. In addition, clinical trials are currently performed with 5–10 μg GLA and 2–4 μg QS-21 (NCT03589794, NCT02508376, and NCT04177355). However, H1 stem protein formulated with 5:2 μg SLA-LSQ induced significantly lower HA stem binding and neutralizing antibody titers in NHPs, compared with AS01B. While the lower adjuvant concentration may contribute to the reduced immunogenicity of this formulation, we hypothesize that the presence of larger fused or aggregated liposomes in this formulation also negatively impacts immunogenicity as fewer particles in the preferred size range are present. In contrast, H1 stem v2 formulated in SLA-LSQ with as low as 10 µg SLA and 25 µg QS-21 induced antibody titers largely comparable with the AS01B-adjuvanted group, while these formulations with a lower SLA and QS-21 dose may have the potential to reduce reactogenicity in humans.Aluminum-based adjuvants also provoke considerably less reactogenicity in humans compared with AS01B12,39, but this is often accompanied by a reduction in immunogenicity12,39,48. However, aluminum hydroxide-based commercial vaccine formulations do in general not combine low amounts of Tris buffer with relatively high amounts of NaCl. We found that two vaccinations with H1 stem protein adjuvanted with an optimized aluminum hydroxide [Al(OH)3 + NaCl] formulation induced HA stem-binding and neutralizing antibodies that were comparable with two vaccinations with H1 stem protein adjuvanted with AS01B. We demonstrated in mice that formulation with Al(OH)3 + NaCl induced stronger immunogenicity and vaccine efficacy, compared with Al(OH)3. Although the percentage of bound H1 stem v2 was comparable in the Al(OH)3 and Al(OH)3 + NaCl formulations, NaCl is thought to improve the immunogenicity by increasing particle aggregation32.We detected the highest cellular responses upon vaccination with H1 stem protein adjuvanted with AS01B. SLA-LSQ induced lower cellular responses, even at TLR4 agonist and QS-21 concentrations similar to AS01B. This might suggest that a synthetic TLR4 agonist less efficiently activates T-cell responses than bacterium-derived MPL®. T-cell responses appeared to be higher upon stimulation with an HA stem peptide pool, compared with a FL-HA peptide pool both at week 10 and week 36. A possible explanation could be the size and complexitiy of the peptide pools (and associated DMSO concentration), which is around twice the size for the FL-HA pool. It has been shown for CD8 T cells that peptide pool size can influence responses in assays49,50. Another explanation is that there might be a response to neoepitopes present in HA stem proteins. T cell epitope mapping in NHP would be required to verify this. As T cell responses were low in general, and H1 stem appears to contain a low number of (protective) T cell epitopes51, further characterization of potential enhancement of the T cell response by SLA-LSQ with an antigen known to induce robust T cell responses is required.We observed a slow decline in HA stem-specific antibody levels after the 2nd dose independent of the adjuvant used. Others have reported different observations in NHP, varying from a strong decline to an increase of antibody levels over time42,43,51,52,53, but a direct comparison is difficult, as studies differ in many aspects such as antigen used, infection versus vaccination, use of adjuvants and follow-up time, among others. In addition, we report here that a 3rd vaccination to mimic responses in a pre-exposed population boosted HA stem-specific antibody levels. This was also reported for an adjuvanted comparable HA stem protein immunogen in NHPs43. AS01B and SLA-LSQ starting at 10 µg SLA and 25 µg QS-21 boosted antibody titers to a higher level than Al(OH)3 + NaCl post dose 3, suggesting that AS01B and SLA-LSQ recall B-cell responses more efficiently. Further characterization of the antigen-specific B and plasma cell populations, antibody repertoire and antibody characteristics would be required to confirm this observation. In humans, AS01B induced high-avidity antibodies at a higher frequency upon antigen recall, suggesting that AS01B contributes to affinity maturation54. By contrast, immunization of NHP with a HA stem antigen in a live virus pre-exposure setting did not boost HA stem-specific antibody levels52, which could be explained by the fact that no adjuvant was used in this study and was also recently observed in humans, where a second dose of an unaduvanted nanoparticle HA stem antigen dit not further boost responses55,56. This emphasizes the benefits of adjuvants for induction or boosting of HA stem-specific immune responses. In our NHP study, levels of HA stem-specific antibodies were higher after the 3rd vaccination when directly compared with stem-HA antibody titers in the adult (pre-exposed) human population after seasonal influenza vaccination using the same ELISA assay to measure samples. This suggests that our H1 stem-based vaccine has the potential to boost HA stem antibody titers in humans.Overall, we have shown that an H1 stem protein adjuvanted with various adjuvants durably enhanced the HA stem-specific humoral immune response in an animal model relevant to humans. All adjuvant formulations elicited comparable humoral responses in vivo, except for the lowest SLA-LSQ dose, in line with in vitro formulation findings. These data support an ongoing phase 1/2a clinical trial in which the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of H1 stem v2 (INFLUENZA G1 mHA, NCT05901636) is being evaluated in healthy adults.MethodsHuman seraSerum was obtained from a vaccine safety and immunogenicity trial (INF-V-A017, EudraCT #2012-001693-28)35, in which subjects received Inflexal V, a trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine of the 2011/2012 composition (H1N1 A/California/07/2009, H3N2 A/Victoria/210/2009 and B/Brisbane/60/2008). Blood was collected on the day of vaccination and four weeks after vaccination. The study was approved by the ‘Universitair Ziekenhuis Antwerpen Comité voor Medische Ethiek’ ethical review board. Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects prior to enrolment.Vaccines and adjuvantsDNA encoding tag-free H1 stem (H1 stem v1, design and alignment with full-length HA amino acid sequence as described by Impagliazzo et al.7) and H1 stem v2, optimized for expression and manufacturability, were synthesized and cloned into pcDNA3 DNA plasmid with a modified cytomegalovirus promotor (Genscript). All H1 stem proteins were based on the HA sequence from H1N1pdm A/California/07/2009, except for the H1 stem v1 used in the murine challenge experiment which was based on H1N1 A/Brisbane/59/2007 HA sequence and also known as ‘#4900”7. Recombinant protein was transiently expressed in ExpiCHO cells.H1 stem v2 has 31% amino acid identiy similarity with full length H1N1 A/Brisbane/59/2007 HA, while the H1N1 A/Brisbane/59/2007 HA stem domain has 67% amino acid identiy similarity with H1 stem v2. H1 stem v2 has 28% amino acid identiy similarity with full length H5N1 A/Hong Kong/156/1997 HA, while the H5N1 A/Hong Kong/156/1997 HA stem domain has 61% amino acid identiy similarity with H1 stem v2.Expression titers and trimer content of recombinant H1 stem proteinExpi293F culture supernatants were harvested at day 3 post transfection, clarified by 0.22 µm filtration. Analytical SEC at day of harvest was performed on an ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography system (Vanquish, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and µDAWN light Scattering detector (Wyatt) coupled to an Optilab µT-rEX Refractive Index Detector (Wyatt). The cleared cell culture supernatants were applied to a Unix-C SEC-300 15 cm column (Sepax) with the corresponding guard column (Sepax) equilibrated in running buffer (150 mM sodium phosphate, 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.0) at 0.3 ml/min. Analytical SEC data was analyzed using the Chromeleon software package (Thermo Fisher Scientific).The trimer content was calculated as the percentage of total protein based on peak heights (in mAU) of the monomeric and trimeric species.Purification of recombinant H1 stem proteinH1 stem v1 and v2 were purified from the clarified ExpiCHO culture supernatant, harvested at day 7, by a two-step protocol. First H1 stem protein was captured by affinity chromatography using a resin consisting of an H1 stem protein binding single domain immobilized to POROS beads (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Following elution by application of a step gradient of elution buffer (0.1 M TRIS, 2 M MgCl2, 40% propylene glycol, pH 7.4), the antigen containing fractions were pooled and further purified by size exclusion chromatography (Superdex 200 pg 2.6 × 60 cm) using 20 mM TRIS, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.8 as mobile phase.In vitro H1 stem protein characterizationThermal stability of purified H1 stem protein was assessed by Differential Scanning Fluorimetry (DSF). Melting temperatures were determined by monitoring the fluorescent emission of Sypro Orange Dye (Thermo Fisher Scientific) added to 6 µg of protein in solution. Starting at 25 °C, the temperature was increased at a rate of 54 °C per hour to a final temperature of 95 °C and melting curves were measured using a ViiA7 real-time PCR machine (Applied Biosystems), and Tm50 values were derived from the negative first derivative. Protein antigenicity was evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). H1 stem protein was directly coated in half area 96-well plated (0.25 µg/mL) and incubated with mAb CR911428, CT14929 (10 µg/mL starting concentration), and Fc fused SD3830 (4 µg/mL starting concentration) in a 3-fold dilution series following incubation with an anti-human Fc horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody (mouse anti-human IgG, Jackson ImmunoResearch, cat 109-035-098, 3750-fold diluted). The luminescent signal of bound antibodies was determined following substrate addition (BM Chemiluminescence ELISA Substrate (POD), Roche) and the EC50 values of the S-curves were determined as an average of 3 independent assays.AdjuvantsAluminum phosphate [AlPO4; Adju-Phos™] and aluminum hydroxide [Al(OH)3: Alhydrogel™ 2%] adjuvants were manufactured and supplied by Croda Denmark, formerly known as Brenntag Biosector, Federikssund, Denmark. The amount of adsorbed protein was indirectly defined by measuring the residual protein in the supernatant after centrifugation of the protein-adjuvant mixture57. The liposomal adjuvants, SLA-LSQ, were manufactured and supplied by Access to Advanced Health Institute (AAHI, Seattle, USA), formerly known as Infectious Diseases Research Institute (IDRI), using QS-21 purified from Quillaja saponaria bark extract as previously reported58. The AS01B adjuvant (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, Rixensart, Belgium) was obtained from the adjuvant vial from the Shingrix vaccine (i.e., without mixing in lyophilized glycoprotein E from the separate antigen vial).In vitro characterization of SLA-LSQSLA-LSQ stock solutions were mixed 1:1 with the formulation buffer (10 mM Tris, 2.5% sucrose, 150 mM NaCl), either with or without H1 stem protein, and characterized by absorbance (turbidity at 350 nm) and fluorescence emission spectroscopy (excitation 280 nm, emission 340 nm) using a Biotek Neo plate reader. In addition, dynamic light scattering was evaluated using a Wyatt Dynapro II plate reader. After characterization, Nile Red was added and mixed into the formulations and the fluorescence emission at 635 nm was measured after excitation at 550 nm. The SLA-LSQ formulations were also characterized by fluorescence microscopy, using 10 µl in a MultiCount 10™ microscopy slide, according to the staining method described by Demeule et al.59. Zeta-potential (mV) was determined using a Zetasizer Nano (Malvern). Nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) was measured using a Nanosight NS300 (Malvern) with a flowcell. To visualize the individual particles in NTA, formulations required a dilution of 300-times in 10 mM Tris, 2.5% sucrose and 150 mM NaCl. Video capture was performed during 120 s.Mouse studiesMouse experiments were approved by the Dutch Central Authority for Scientific Procedures on Animals (Centrale Commissie Dierproeven) and conducted in accordance with the European guidelines (EU directive on animal testing 2010/63/EU and ETS 123) and local Dutch legislation on animal experiments. The in vivo phase of mouse studies was performed at Triskelion, Zeist, The Netherlands. Female BALB/cAnNCrl mice aged 6–8 weeks at the start of study were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Germany). Mice were vaccinated intramuscularly with 100 μl (divided over the two hind legs) H1 stem v2 vaccine adjuvanted with either 50 μg 2% AlPO4, Al(OH)3, Al(OH)3 + PBS or Al(OH)3 + NaCl. The characteristics of the aluminum salt-based adjuvant formulations are listed in Table 1. Blood was collected via the tail vein. Immunizations and blood collections were performed on conscious, restrained animals. Mice were intranasally inoculated with 12.5xLD50 of H1N1 A/Brisbane/59/2007 or H5N1 A/Hong Kong/156/1997 in a volume of 50 µl (25 µl per nostril) under general anesthesia with ketamine/xylazine applied intraperitoneally. Health monitoring was performed twice daily during the 21-day follow-up after virus inoculation. Animals were considered moribund and euthanized for ethical reasons if lethargy is noted in four subsequent observations. The surviving animals were sacrificed on day 21 by O2/CO2 anesthesia followed by CO2 asphyxiation.NHP studyHousing and handling of NHPs was performed in accordance with the standards of the AAALAC International’s reference resource: the 8th edition of the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory animals, Animal Welfare Act as amended, and the 2015 reprint of the Public Health Service (PHS) Policy on Human Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Handling of samples and animals occurred in compliance with the Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL), 5th edition (Centers for Disease Control). This study was performed under IACUC-approved protocol no. 18-19.Fifty-seven adult (28 male and 29 female) Cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) were purchased from Beijing Prima Biotech (China) and the in vivo phase of the study was performed at Alpha Genesis Inc, Yemassee, South Carolina. Prior to study start, all animals were subjected to a health assessment and they were confirmed negative for tuberculosis, simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), simian retrovirus (SRV), simian T-lymphotropic virus (STLV), Herpes B virus, measles and seronegative for influenza viruses as measured by a haemagglutinin inhibition assay (HI assay) for influenza strains known to have been recently circulating in the human population prior to study start. The animals were assigned to 7 study groups using randomized stratification based on body weight and sex.Groups of 8–9 influenza-naïve cynomolgus macaques were intramuscularly immunized with 50 µg H1 stem v2 protein. The antigen was either unadjuvanted (Group 1) or mixed with SLA-LSQ adjuvant formulations that differ in the final amount of SLA and QS21: 50 µg SLA/50 µg QS-21 (Group 2), 25 µg SLA/25 µg QS-21 (Group 3), 10 µg SLA/ 25 µg QS-21 (Group 4), 5 µg SLA/ 2 µg QS-21 (Group 5). Two groups were immunized with either H1 stem v2 adjuvanted with 750 µg aluminum hydroxide adjuvant [Al(OH)3 + NaCl, Group 6] or human dose of AS01B (50 µg MPL®:50 µg QS-21; Group 7). Animals were immunized through the intramuscular route in week 0, week 8 and week 34 in an injection volume of 0.75 mL. Blood for serum was obtained at regular intervals. One animal from group 7 (AS01B) was lost to follow-up as it did not recover from anesthesia after biotechnical procedures in week 12. After reviewing of all data, it was decided that the death was deemed unrelated to vaccine or adjuvant. For all procedures, the animals were anesthetized intramuscularly with ketamine hydrochloride (10–20 mg/kg) or tiletaminezolazepam (5–8 mg/kg). The injection site was marked with indelible ink and scored according to the Draize Grading scale for 3 days post immunization, where edema was graded as none (no swelling), minimal (slight swelling), mild (defined swelling—distinct), moderate (defined swelling— raised), severe (pronounced swelling). Erythema was graded as none (normal color), minimal (light pink), mild (bright pink/ pale red), moderate (bright red), severe (dark red).Mouse ELISAHA-specific binding IgG antibody levels were measured by ELISA against a H1N1 A/California/07/2009 full-length HA. Briefly, 96-well ½ area plates were coated for 2 h with 0.5 µg/ml H1 A/California/07/2009 HA protein (Protein Sciences) at 37 °C in a humidified incubator. Plates were washed with PBS with 0.05% Tween (PBS-T) and subsequently blocked with block buffer (PBS + 2% BSA). After incubation for 1 hour, the plates were washed with PBS-T and serum/ control samples were added to the plates in duplicate, serially diluted in block buffer. Following a wash with PBS-T, a 1:20.000 dilution of anti-mouse IgG-HRP (KPL cat 474-1802) was added, incubated for 1 h, washed with PBS-T and Enhanced ChemiLuminescence (ECL, Bio-Rad) detection substrate was added. The luminescence signal was determined after 10 min, expressed as relative luminescence units (RLU). RLU signals were normalized per plate, and the log10 transformed normalized values were fitted using a four-parameter logistic model. Titers were calculated as a dilution ratio between a sample and the reference standard at 50% of the fitted signal (log10 relative titer).NHP and human ELISAHA-specific binding IgG antibody levels were measured by ELISA against C-terminally biotinylated H1N1 A/California/07/2009 full-length HA and a C-terminally biotinylated H1N1 A/California/07/2009 HA stem with different engineered stabilization domains60 to exclude irrelevant cross-reactive responses to non-HA derived epitopes. Briefly, 96-well ½-area plates were incubated with 5 μg/mL streptavidin for 2 h at 37 °C in a humidified incubator. Plates were washed with PBS with 0.05% Tween (PBS-T) and subsequently blocked with block buffer (PBS + 1% casein). Plates were incubated with 1 µg/ml C-terminally biotinylated H1N1 A/California/07/2009 full-length HA or HA stem. After incubation for 1 h, serum samples or 3 µg/ml reference standard (mAb CR911428) were added to the plates in duplicate, serially diluted in block buffer and incubated for 1 h. Following a wash with PBS-T, a 1:3750 dilution of anti-human IgG-HRP (Jackson ImmunoResearch, cat 109-035-098) was added, incubated for 1 h, washed with PBS-T and Enhanced ChemiLuminescence (ECL, Bio-Rad) detection substrate added. The luminescence signal was determined after 10 min, expressed as RLU. RLU signals were normalized per plate, and log10 transformed normalized values fitted using a four-parameter logistic model. Titers were calculated as a dilution ratio between a sample and the reference standard at 10% of the fitted signal (log10 relative titer).ADCC hFcγRIIIa reporter assayTo measure HA-specific antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) Fc effector functions elicited by H1 stem vaccination, serum samples were analyzed using an ADCC hFcγRIIIa reporter assay (Promega). Briefly, human lung carcinoma-derived A549 epithelial cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium supplemented with fetal calf serum. Two days before the experiment, cells were transfected with plasmid DNA encoding H1N1 A/California/07/2009 full-length HA. One day before the assay, transfected cells were harvested and seeded in 96-well plates. After 24 h, serum samples were diluted in assay buffer and heat-inactivated, followed by serial dilution in assay buffer. The cells were replenished with fresh assay buffer and ADCC Bioassay effector cells (a stable Jurkat cell line expressing human hFcγRIIIa [V158 variant], human CD3γ, and an NFAT-response element driving expression of a luciferase reporter gene) were added and incubated. Bio-Glo Luciferase Assay System substrate was added, and the luminescence signal was read. Data are expressed as endpoint titers, which are defined as the reciprocal dilution where a pre-defined, arbitrarily threshold (5 × 104 RLU) is reached.Pseudovirus entry inhibition assayNeutralizing antibody titers were measured with a pseudo virus particle entry inhibition assay (ppVNA), using a panel of strains expressing influenza A group 1 HA and neuraminidase (NA) at Monogram (San Francisco, USA): H1N1 A/Fort Monmouth/1/1947, H1N1 A/South Carolina/1/1918, H1N1 A/USSR/90/1977, H1N1 A/New Caledonia/20/1999, H1N1 A/Brisbane/59/2007, H1N1 A/California/07/2009, H5N1 A/Hong Kong/156/1997, H5N1 A/Indonesia/05/2005, H6N2 A/Turkey/Massachusetts/3740/1965, H8N4 A/duck/Yangzhou/02/2005, H9N2 A/Hong Kong/1073/1999.Influenza virus neutralization was measured using a recombinant pseudo-influenza virus assay that involves a single round of infection. A replication-defective retroviral vector (RTV1.F-lucP.CNDO delta U3) containing a firefly luciferase gene was co-transfected into human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cell cultures along with HA and NA expression vectors. A fourth expression vector containing a human airway serine protease used in processing the HA protein, TMPRSS2, was also transfected. The resultant pseudoviruses were harvested from culture supernatants, filtered, titrated and stored at −80 °C. Murine leukemia virus envelope (aMLV) pseudotyped virus was used as a control. The pseudovirus stocks, at a concentration giving approximately 30,000-300,000 RLU per well, were incubated at 37 °C for one hour with 3- or 4-fold serial diluted serum samples in a 96-well plate starting at a 1:10 dilution. HEK293 cells were then added to each well and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2. After 3 days, luciferase substrate and cell lysing reagents were added to the plates which were read on a luminometer. Inhibition curves were fitted by a four-parameter sigmoidal function using nonlinear least-squares and bootstrapping. Resulting curves were used to calculate the serum dilution/antibody concentration required to inhibit virus infection by 50% (IC50). Neutralization titers were expressed as the reciprocal of the IC50 serum dilution (ID50).Neutralizing-breadth potency plots were generated according to Joyce et al.61. Briefly, the percentage of human-infecting influenza HA subtypes neutralized by serum (defined as percentage coverage) was calculated per animal as the minimum branch length connecting all neutralized viruses (at the specified log10 reciprocal ID50) divided by total branch length of the phylogenetic tree generated from all tested viral strains. The sequence alignment and the phylogenetic tree were generated using the Neighbor Joining method and Jukes-Cantor distance measure using CLC Main workbench 8.1 (Qiagen Aarhus, Denmark). The area under the curve (AUC) of breadth potency plots was calculated using the trapezoidal rule to quantify the breadth of neutralization. Breadth-potency plots were generated and AUC calculations performed using R.4.1.1 and libraries ape 5.6.262 and tidyverse 1.3.163.Intracellular cytokine staining (ICS)Antigen-specific cytokine secretion was measured by ICS at Texas Biomedical Research Institute (San Antonio, Texas). 1–2 × 106 PBMC were stimulated overnight with peptide pools of 15-mer peptides with 11-amino acid overlap (covering the entire length of H1N1 A/California/07/2009 HA or H1 stem), negative control (medium) or positive control (SEB), in the presence of Brefeldin A at 37 °C (5% CO2 and 95% humidity). Samples were stained by Live/Dead Aqua dye (Invitrogen) for dead cell discrimination. Cells were surface stained with anti-CD3-PerCP-Cy5.5 (cloneSP34.2, BD cat. 552852, 1:3400 dilution), anti-CD4-APC-H7 (clone L200, BD cat. 560837 1:3400 dilution), and anti-CD8-PE-Cy7 (clone SK1, Biolegend cat. 344712, 1:5667 dilution) for 30 minutes at 4 °C. The cells were then permeabilized with Cytofix/Cytoperm and subsequently stained intracellularly using anti-IFN-γ-APC (clone B27, Biolegend cat. 506510, 1:6000 dilution), anti-TNF-α-FITC (Mab11, BD cat. 552889, 1:2000 dilution), anti-IL-2-BV421 (MQ1-17H12, BD cat. 564164, 1:6000 dilution), anti-CD69-PE (clone FN50, Biolegend cat. 310906, 1:6000 dilution) antibodies for 30 min at room temperature. T cells were identified by consecutive gating on size (lymphocytes; FSC-A versus side scatter-A), single cells (forward scatter [FSC]-H versus FSC-A), live cells, CD3+, CD4+, or CD8+ cells, and CD69+ plus cytokine-positive (Supplemental Fig. 10). Boolean gating was used to measure single, double or triple IFN-γ, TNF-α or IL-2 positive cells. The frequency of cytokine-positive cells is presented after subtraction of the background response detected in the corresponding medium-stimulated sample of each individual animal.LuminexAntigen-specific cytokine secretions were measured with a 14-plex cytokine secretion assay at the Texas Biomedical Research Institute. Briefly, 4 × 105 PBMC were stimulated overnight in the presence of peptide pools of 15-mer peptides with 11-amino acid overlap, covering the entire length of H1N1 A/California/07/2009 HA or H1 stem, negative control (medium) or positive control (SEB). 24 h after stimulation an aliquot of the supernatant was removed to measure concentrations of: IL-22, IP-10, IL-4, Perforin, IFN-y, IL-17, I-TAC, TNF-a, sCD40L, MIG, IL-9, IL-6, MCP-1 and IL-2 by Luminex, according to manufacturer’s instructions. The full-length H1 HA and H1 stem group means have been centered and scaled with the root-mean-squared-error from an analysis-of-variance, with group as factor. Hierarchical clustering has been applied in the resulting heatmap to both the rows and columns. The rows have been sorted within the trees by the mean absolute deviation of the standardized group means, and the columns have been sorted by the mean of the standardized group means. In this way, the more statistically significant assays are at the top and the groups with higher responses are on the right.Statistical analysisMouse study comparing HA stem v1 vs v2Comparisons of the survival proportion were performed using a two-sided Fisher’s exact test.Mouse study comparing aluminum-based adjuvantsComparisons of the survival proportion with the mock-group were performed using a two-sided Fisher’s exact test with a 4-fold Bonferroni-correction and a step-wise approach starting with the highest dose of H1 stem per alum salt formulation. Across dose comparisons of the survival proportion were performed using a two-sided Fisher’s exact test with a 4-fold Bonferroni-correction.Comparisons of the ELISA titers with the mock-group were performed using an ANOVA with treatment as a group factor with a 4-fold Bonferroni-correction and a step-wise approach starting with the highest dose of H1 stem per alum salt formulation. Across dose comparisons of the ELISA titers were performed using an ANOVA with treatment as a group factor with a 4-fold Bonferroni-correction.NHP studyComparisons between the SLA-LSQ groups and the AS01B group were performed using the Wilcoxon rank sum test for all assays. No multiple comparison adjustment was applied.Human seraComparisons were performed using a paired nonparametric Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test.For all statistical tests, the significance level was 5%. All statistical calculations were done in SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc). Data availability All data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon request.

Secretary of Health Dr. Carlos Mellado López urged Puerto Ricans to get vaccinated to help stop the spread of the flu virus. Pablo Martinez/GFR Media/AP CNN — The Puerto Rico Department of Health declared an influenza epidemic Thursday, with at least 900 hospitalizations and 25,900 cases recorded since flu season began in July. It’s the first flu epidemic in the US territory since 2016, officials say.

Tiger Mosquitoes invade France this summer - Paris - 19 Aug 2023 Geyres Christophe/ABACA/Shutterstock/FILE FDA approves first vaccine against chikungunya virus As of November 4, there have been 42 confirmed deaths this season, according to Dr. Melissa Marzán, an epidemiologist with the health department. Nine other deaths are under investigation. “The current flu season began above the alert threshold,” Marzán said, adding that there have been nearly six times as many cases this flu season as there were at this time last year. In order to declare an epidemic, she says, several criteria need to be met. One is that the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s monitoring system for the virus needs to reach a high level. Puerto Rico’s flu activity is currently high, data from the CDC confirms. “This is not the time to be alarmed, but to prepare to help prevent the increase in the spread of this virus,” Secretary of Health Dr. Carlos Mellado López said in a statement. The Puerto Rico Department of Health also reported that it will begin a mass vaccination program.

We know that influenza has a period where transmission is usually high. If we do our part, get vaccinated, and protect ourselves, we will stop the disease,” Mellado López said. The majority of flu cases appear to be in children and young people, with more than 13,600 cases recorded among newborns through 19-year-olds, according to the health department. More than 9,600 cases were recorded among adults between 20 and 59 years old, while older adults made up about 2,500 cases. Puerto Rico’s 2022-23 flu season had 31,710 total cases, with 15 deaths and 1,224 hospitalizations, the health department said.

The virus can cause mild to severe illness in people.According to the USDA, the virus was also found in flocks in two of Minnesota's four neighboring states of Iowa (162,550 birds) and South Dakota (300,800 birds).The federal agency also said 26,800 turkeys are slated to be slaughtered at a McPherson County farm in South Dakota, the AP reported, and just under 17,000 birds are set to be killed on two farms in Iowa’s Clay County.A USDA spokesperson could not immediately be reached for comment Wednesday.What is the bird flu? The bird flu, is disease caused by a family of flu viruses primarily transmitted between birds.Avian influenza viruses, according to the CDC and USDA, are classified into two groups: Low Pathogenic Avian Influenza (LPAI) (often seen in wild birds) and Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) (found mostly in domestic poultry). According to the Centers for Disease Control, LPAI viruses cause mild or no disease and HPAI cause severe disease and high mortality rates in infected birds.The bird flu has cost the government roughly $660 million and in recent times raised the price of eggs and poultry. At least 58 million birds have been slaughtered this year to limit the spread of the virus.Bird flu confirmed in Antarctic region: First cases of bird flu confirmed more than 1,000 miles from South AmericaWhat are signs of bird flu?Indications a bird may be infected with avian influenza include:Loss of appetite, lethargySudden death without prior symptomsEyelid swellingTwisting of the head and neckPurple discoloration to body parts including waddle and legsStumbling and fallingDiarrheaDifficulty breathingNasal dischargeBird flu symptoms in humansBird flu infections in humans are rare according to the CDC.The first case of avian influenza in a person in the United States was reported in Colorado in April 2022.As of Wednesday, according to CDC stats, only four human infections with LPAI viruses had been identified in the United States - and all four people suffered mild-to-moderate illness.Human infection with the bird flu can happen during close contact with infected birds or when people touch sick birds or their saliva, mucus and feces, the CDC said. People contract the virus when it gets into a their eyes, nose or mouth, or when it is inhaled.Those who contract the virus often experience mild illnesses including an eye infection and upper respiratory symptoms or no symptoms at all, while others can develop a severe sometimes fatal disease like pneumonia.Natalie Neysa Alund is a senior reporter for USA TODAY.

Influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and COVID-19 are circulating this fall, but not yet at the rate that worried public health agencies a year ago. As we approach the time of winter when these diseases usually peak, around December to February, experts warn that the patterns can change at any time and advise people to take precautionary measures, such as getting vaccines. For those who are concerned about respiratory viruses, there is good news: the Food and Drug Administration approved two RSV vaccines and another shot for use in vulnerable populations. Several vaccine makers also have updated their COVID-19 boosters, which are recommended for those who are over age 5. Public health experts generally expect a milder flu season this year. Last year was especially severe as social activities returned to normal and COVID-19 social distancing rules ended. Experts say that more than two years of staying at home and taking precautionary measures protected people from influenza viruses, but also reduced their immunity once they resumed normal social activity. “We are seeing pretty decent matches with the flu vaccine, which is going to help and we haven’t seen a big take off locally and nationally yet of the flu,” said Dr. Marlene Millen, an internal medicine doctor at UC San Diego.

Here’s what you should know about this cold and flu season. What is the outlook for flu, RSV and COVID? “The big answer is that it is uncertain,” said Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, infectious disease physician at UC San Francisco. Experts say the exact patterns of infection of any of these respiratory viruses cannot be predicted due to several factors, such as human interaction, travel and preventative habits. According to the California Department of Public Health, it is too soon to know how severe each of the diseases will be this season. “As more people are heading indoors for school, fitness routines, and festive gatherings, Californians are getting exposed to respiratory viruses,” said Dr. Tomás Aragón, director of the state Public Health Department in a press release. “Anyone can be affected by winter illnesses, however, some individuals, including older adults, people with weakened immune systems or chronic conditions, pregnant people and young children are at higher risk for severe illness and death.” “These aren’t new viruses, so all of the risks are already there. The biggest thing is listening to what is going on and paying attention.”Dr. Marlene Millen of UC San diego Chin-Hong said that while infections from COVID-19 have plateaued in the past few months, there may be an uptick in infections on the horizon, especially among vulnerable populations. The state’s respiratory infections reports show that RSV infections are currently rising ahead of flu and COVID-19. But the state also has more tools to battle the disease compared to last year. The new RSV shots, combined with the leftover immunity from last year, Chin-Hong said, may result in a comparatively milder RSV season from last year. What experts are worried about is the rate of infections for all three of these respiratory diseases peaking together at the same time, which can overwhelm health care systems. That scenario is now known as a “tripledemic.” “Every year, that’s a possibility. I always cross my fingers that that doesn’t happen because we get very busy in the hospitals, especially in the clinics and other places,” Millen said. “Every year since COVID, it has been a concern that all three will kind of peak at once. And if that happens, then our health care system gets even more strained.” Should I be worried? Millen said even though infections could spread faster than predicted, there is no reason to panic. “These aren’t new viruses, so all of the risks are already there,” she said. “The biggest thing is listening to what is going on and paying attention.” Several treatments can help reduce serious infections and death rates. Experts also say that people should continue to exercise preventative measures such as wearing masks, washing hands and staying away from crowded places as they did during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. How do I know if I have flu, COVID-19 or RSV? All three viruses have similar symptoms in that they attack the respiratory system and cause symptoms like cold, fever, cough, stuffy or runny nose, body ache and fatigue, as well as chills. Infections from all three viruses can also be asymptomatic. Doctors recommend isolating if you develop any respiratory systems or fever at all, to avoid putting others around you at risk, especially young children and the elderly. “If you’re sick, stay home,” Millen said. “Viral loads are really high in those first few days of illness and that’s when spreading illnesses happens, so just wait.” What is the current guidance on vaccinations? For influenza and COVID-19, the state Department of Public Health recommends vaccinations for all who are 6 months or older. Anyone over 6 months old should get the annual flu shot, while those 5 years and older should also get the updated COVID-19 booster this year. For RSV, doctors recommend all those who are eligible to get vaccinated. This includes adults who are 60 or older, pregnant women, infants who are 8 months or younger and high risk children between 8-19 months old. For those who do not have health insurance, California has several resources to get free vaccines, including federally qualified health centers, Bridge Access Program for COVID-19 vaccines, and the Vaccines for Children program. What is happening with the new RSV vaccine? Earlier this year, three shots were approved for RSV: two vaccines and an antibody shot. The two vaccines are approved for use in elderly and pregnant women. The vaccine for pregnant women is recommended to be used between weeks 32 and 36 of the pregnancy and will reduce the risk of infection in newborns. The vaccine for seniors is available for all adults 60 or older as they are at higher risk from infections than younger adults. The antibody preparation provides lab-prepared monoclonal antibodies to infants and young children at high risk from infections who may not be able to produce their own antibodies. This shot is recommended for all infants under 8 months as well as high-risk children between 8-19 months old. There is currently a shortage of the antibody shot, which is causing concern among pediatricians, especially as RSV infections rise this winter.

By Cyra-Lea Drummond, BSN, RN Published on November 09, 2023 Fact checked by Nick Blackmer Print Westend61 Close Key Takeaways Even young, healthy individuals can become critically ill from the flu.The flu vaccine may not prevent 100% of flu cases, but it will decrease your likelihood of developing severe illness from the influenza virus.Patients and families whose lives have been direly impacted by the flu are spreading awareness of the importance of getting a yearly flu vaccine. In March of 2013, then-33-year-old Allison Miller started feeling run down on a Friday evening. The following day, she woke up feeling worse, with a bad cough and sore throat, so she went to urgent care, where providers took a chest X-ray, gave her a prescription cough syrup, and instructed her to return if she continued to get worse. Over the next 24 hours, Allison declined quickly. “I had a ton of back pain. I am fairly sure I blacked out a couple of times. I had never felt so sick in my life,” she told Verywell. Allison called a friend for help, who called 911 upon seeing her condition. Allison does not recall the most acute phase of her illness, and much of that time was recounted to her by others. She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with pneumonia and sepsis, experienced organ failure, and was placed on an extreme form of life support called extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for five days. Circulation complications from ECMO cost Allison her left leg. Allison didn’t have a mystery illness—she had influenza. Had she known about the potential risk of complications, she says she would’ve gotten a flu shot, despite not having any risk factors for severe disease. “I didn’t realize that the [CDC] advice had changed,” she said, explaining she thought only the elderly, healthcare workers, and the immunocompromised individual needed a flu shot. “I didn’t see a doctor regularly enough to have it suggested to me, so it didn’t occur to me as something I needed to do. A flu shot is not a guarantee I wouldn’t have gotten sick, but it probably wouldn’t have been as severe as it ended up being.” Allison’s story highlights an important fact: Even young, healthy individuals can become critically ill from the flu. Influenza sends thousands of people to the hospital each year. That’s why annual flu shots are so important, and why Allison now advocates for them as a part of the nonprofit organization Families Fighting Flu. How Deadly Is the Flu? Why Flu Complications Can Happen Mild-to-moderate cases of the flu will resolve on their own within a few weeks. However, in some cases, the immune system overreacts to the flu, causing widespread inflammation throughout the body. The immune response spirals out of control, and the same substances that should fight the flu begin to damage healthy body tissues that are not infected by the virus. For example, severe flu can lead to myocarditis (inflammation of the heart), encephalitis (inflammation of the brain), and multiorgan failure, particularly of the kidneys and lungs. Sepsis (a life-threatening, whole-body response to infection), is another potential complication of the flu. Signs Your Illness Is Serious The most common symptoms of the flu are cough, fever, chills, body aches, sore throat, fatigue, nausea and vomiting. To avoid spreading the influenza virus, avoid leaving your home unless absolutely necessary until you have been fever-free (without fever-reducing medications like Tylenol) for at least 24 hours. Adults should seek medical care if they begin to develop any of the following: Fever or cough improves for a time, then begins to worsenShortness of breath or difficulty breathingPersistent pain or pressure in the chest or abdomenA change in mental status such as confusion or lethargySeizuresSigns of dehydration, such as no urinationSevere muscle pain, weakness, unsteadiness, or dizzinessPre-existing chronic health conditions begin to worsen In addition to the above, parents or guardians should seek medical care if they notice any of the following in their child: Fast breathingRibs pulling inward with each breath (also called retractions)Bluish lips or nails (a sign of low oxygen)No wet diapers or urination for eight hours, dry mouth, crying but producing no tearsA fever in a child less than 12 weeks old, or a fever above 104 in a child of any age Recognizing Early Flu Symptoms in Children Trouble breathing was the first sign something was wrong in 5-year-old Caroline Miller, who was swimming three times a week and taking gymnastic classes when she became sick with the flu in December 2012. She didn’t exhibit the usual flu symptoms of fever, chills, and muscle aches, but did have a minor cough and congestion. Her asthma medications were not enough to get her breathing under control. At the advice of their pediatrician, Caroline’s mother, Jennifer Miller, took her daughter to the hospital. Caroline’s subsequent diagnosis of influenza A and pneumonia in both lungs required supplemental oxygen, and an eventual airlift to a hospital with a dedicated pediatric unit for more specialized management. “The thought of your child going on a helicopter is terrifying, but even more heartbreaking, we couldn’t go with her. You’re signing over responsibility of your child to perfect strangers,” Jennifer, who also works with Families Fighting Flu, told Verywell. She said her family had been planning on getting the flu shot, but hadn’t made time for it yet. “When you see a loved one, particularly a child, clinging to life because you didn’t take advantage of a life-saving intervention, it changes the trajectory of all things.” After two weeks in a medically induced coma on an oscillatory ventilator, Caroline began to recover. She required rehab with physical and occupational therapists, and is a healthy 16-year-old field hockey player today. Almost Everyone Needs a Flu Shot Since 2010, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that individuals aged 6 months and older receive a yearly flu vaccine, including busy, active, healthy people. The only people who should not get a flu shot are individuals who have had a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction (such as anaphylaxis) to any of the flu vaccine’s ingredients or a previous flu shot. Anyone with a history of Guillain-Barré syndrome (a severe, paralyzing illness) should speak with their provider before getting a flu shot. Even if you don’t think you personally need a flu shot, remember: It’s protecting people around you who are high-risk. “From newborns up to the age of 5 or 6, the immune system is immature, so we worry about children getting complications from influenza. In older adults, the immune system is starting to slow down, so it’s just not as strong as it used to be,” Gregg Sylvester, MD, MPH, a pediatrician and the Chief Health Officer of CSL Seqirus, a leader in influenza vaccine science, told Verywell. “We worry about the two ends of the spectrum, but the recommendation applies to everyone. Anybody is at risk of getting complications from the flu. It’s crucial to understand that the flu is not just a bad cold.” If you’re hesitant to get the immunization because of needles, you may be eligible for a nasal flu vaccine called FluMist Quadrivalent. Unlike other flu vaccines, which use a weakened or deadened form of the influenza virus, the nasal vaccine uses a live flu virus. That means it’s not safe for certain groups of people, including (but not limited to) anyone aged 50 or older or people with weakened immune systems. FluMist Quadrivalent is less widely available than conventional flu shots, so you will need to search for a local pharmacy or physician's office that offers it. “Both nasal flu vaccines and traditional flu shots offer relatively similar protection against the season’s circulating strains of influenza when administered in the populations and age groups for which they are licensed,” Sylvester said. “Choosing one or the other may be a personal preference or convenience. Regardless of vaccine preference, everyone needs to do their part in protecting themselves and loved ones by receiving an annual influenza vaccine.” You Might Be Able to Give Yourself a FluMist Vaccine at Home Next Year Many quick-care clinics and pharmacies offer same-day vaccines, so you don’t need to make an appointment with your doctor’s office days or weeks in advance. “Go ahead and get the vaccine,” Allison said. “There’s not a downside to protecting yourself against the permanent effects of the flu.” What This Means For You Getting a flu vaccine is a quick and simple way to protect yourself and those around you from the potentially dire consequences of the flu. Medicare, Medicaid, and all Affordable Care Act (ACA)-compliant health insurance policies cover flu vaccines, so there will be no out-of-pocket cost to you. If you do not have health insurance, you may be able to receive low-cost vaccines from your local health department. Children who do not have health insurance or whose insurance does not cover all vaccines qualify for no-cost vaccines through the federal Vaccines for Children (VFC) program. 4 Sources Verywell Health uses only high-quality sources, including peer-reviewed studies, to support the facts within our articles.

Egg Producers AssociationCBC News · Posted: Nov 08, 2023 4:51 PM EST | Last Updated: November 8, 2023Cases of the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain of avian flu have been detected at 16 farms in B.C. since late October. (Jay-Dee/Shutterstock)Social SharingAvian flu is spreading rapidly again through poultry farms in British Columbia, with the virus discovered in half a dozen commercial flocks this week alone.Birds at eight commercial poultry farms in the Fraser Valley and small flocks in both Merritt and Port McNeill have also recently tested positive for avian influenza, bringing the total number of confirmed outbreaks to 16 since late October, according to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA). The affected farms in the Fraser Valley include operations in Chilliwack, Agassiz, Mission, Abbotsford and Langley. The birds tested positive for the highly pathenogenic H5N1 strain, which was first detected in Canada in 2021 and has since led to the loss of millions of birds. H5N1, which is spread through contact with an infected bird or its feces or nasal secretions, is highly contagious and deadly to birds. In October, farmers were ordered by B.C.'s chief veterinarian to take extra precautions to reduce the risk of transmitting the virus, including restricting poultry events and keeping birds indoors. Avian flu outbreaks are more likely to occur during fall, when migrating wild birds can pass it on to poultry farms or backyard flocks. Avian flu detected on poultry farm in ChilliwackMark Siemens, president of the B.C. Egg Producers Association, says farmers in the province are expecting the spread to be particularly bad this year. "We are preparing ourselves for a long and difficult fall and winter," said Siemens, who owns a chicken farm in Abbotsford. He says experiencing an outbreak at this time of year is devastating for farmers, as it could mean the loss of their entire operation through the holiday season. "It's also animals that you care about and that you've really invested your time and energy into, so it is a very mentally and emotionally straining time for these producers," he said.Avian flu threat fades on farms but may be back in the fallAround 370,000 birds have already been euthanized since October due to avian flu, according to Amanda Brittain from the B.C. Poultry Association. She says this is unlikely to affect chicken prices in grocery stores. "We're very lucky in Canada to have supply management for poultry and that keeps pricing somewhat stable," said Brittain. The outbreak during the fall and winter of 2022-23 season resulted in about three million birds being culled in B.C. The province's worst season on record, in 2004, saw 17 million birds being destroyed. B.C.'s Ministry of Agriculture says farmers need to remain vigilant, and any sick or dead bird should be reported through the province's wild bird surveillance hotline at 1-866-431-2473.

As the physical barrier against inhaled air pollutants, airway epithelium is a primary target for PM2.5 and influenza viruses, two major environmental insults. Recent studies have shown that PM2.5 and influenza viruses may interact to aggravate airway inflammation, an essential event in the pathogenesis of diverse pulmonary diseases. Airway epithelium plays a critical role in lung health and disorders. Thus far, the mechanisms for the interactive effect of PM2.5 and the influenza virus on gene transcription of airway epithelial cells have not been fully uncovered. In this present pilot study, the transcriptome sequencing approach was introduced to identify responsive genes following individual and co-exposure to PM2.5 and influenza A (H3N2) viruses in a human bronchial epithelial cell line (BEAS-2B). Enrichment analysis revealed the function of differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Specifically, the DEGs enriched in the xenobiotic metabolism by the cytochrome P450 pathway were linked to PM2.5 exposure. In contrast, the DEGs enriched in environmental information processing and human diseases, such as viral protein interaction with cytokines and cytokine receptors and epithelial cell signaling in bacterial infection, were significantly related to H3N2 exposure. Meanwhile, co-exposure to PM2.5 and H3N2 affected G protein-coupled receptors on the cell surface. Thus, the results from this study provides insights into PM2.5- and influenza virus-induced airway inflammation and potential mechanisms.

Due to its small size and high specific surface area, PM2.5 can absorb diverse harmful substances from the air, including microbes, transition metals, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), then enters the lungs and other remote regions through the circulatory system1,2,3. Even though air pollution mitigation measures have achieved impressive gains in China in the last several years, PM2.5 remains a significant threat to human health4. A recent study has demonstrated that PM2.5 pollution still causes around 4.23 million deaths globally each year5. Previous study has shown that PM2.5 accounts for 96% of PM seen in human lung parenchyma6, directly causing or aggravating respiratory diseases. Long-term PM2.5 exposure has been associated with higher hospitalization and mortality for pneumonia, lung cancer, cardiovascular disorders, and neurological diseases7,8,9,10. A case-crossover study of 40,002 people in Guangzhou found that each 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 concentration was related to a 1.6% increase in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) hospitalization11. The interaction of PM2.5 and the influenza virus has been reported in multiple epidemiological investigations, showing a correlation between exposure to PM2.5 and higher hospitalization and mortality rates by respiratory viral infections12,13,14.Influenza is a devastating respiratory viral disease that infects around one billion people each year and kills 500,00015. The most prevalent kind of influenza virus is influenza A virus (IAV), with H1N1 and H3N2 as the main subtypes causing influenza, pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome16. Incubation time for influenza viruses ranges from one to three days following infection of the host, and the development of influenza symptoms is largely dependent on the body's innate immune system's capacity to eliminate the virus17. Previous study has demonstrated that air pollution influences viral infection through modification of the viral life cycle or the intensity of the host's innate and adaptive immune response after infection18. Epidemiological investigations and experimental studies have demonstrated that exposure to environmental PM can result in the exacerbation of adverse health effects linked with respiratory viral infection in humans, and that metals in PM can interact with respiratory viruses via complicated modes of action leading to serious harm in humans19,20. For example, ozone (O3) exposure promotes the production of protein hydrolases, which more efficiently activate influenza virus particles, resulting in greater IAV infection21. PM10 increases H5N1 influenza virus infection in A549 cells (a human alveolar epithelial cell line) by modulating the innate immune response22. PM2.5 poses a negative impact on the innate immune system of the lung by altering the function of bronchial epithelial cells' mucus cilia, hindering alveolar macrophages' ability to destroy pathogens, reducing the natural killer (NK) cell response, and causing airway epithelial cell dysfunction23,24,25. By inhibiting lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced activation of the NLRP3 (NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing protein 3) inflammasome and production of interferon-β (IFN-β) during influenza infection, PM2.5 could also change the inflammatory responses of macrophages26. Taken together, these studies suggest that air pollutants can increase influenza virus infectivity and disease severity by inducing inflammation, suppressing host innate and adaptive immunity, reducing antiviral ability, and increasing virus replication.Airway epithelial cells, a physical barrier against inhaled air pollutants, are the primary targets of environmental hazards including PM2.5 and influenza viruses27. In this study, we used a normal human bronchial epithelial cell line (BEAS-2B) as an in vitro model and transcriptomic approach to examine the joint effects of PM2.5 and H3N2 on the transcriptome of human airway epithelium to provide insights into the mechanisms for interactions of ambient PM2.5 and H3N2.ResultsMetallic elements of PM2.5 ICP-MS was used to detect the content of various metallic elements in PM2.5. As shown in Fig. 1, The top 10 metallic elements in terms of concentration in the PM2.5 samples utilized in this study were Al, Fe, Mg, Ca, Cu, Zn, Bi, Sc, Y, In, Ti. Of them, Al, Fe, Ca, and Mg are crustal elements, implying that road and construction specks of dust may have the greatest impact on air quality in the winter and spring seasons of Xinxiang, where the study was performed.Figure 1The top 10 Metallic elements composition of PM2.5 (\({\overline{\text{X}}}\) ± SD, n = 3).Full size imageCytotoxicity of PM2.5 exposure and H3N2 infection on BEAS-2B cellsCCK-8 assay was used to evaluate the cytotoxicity of PM2.5 exposure and H3N2 virus infection on BEAS-2B cells, which showed that exposure to PM2.5 (0–100 μg/mL) and H3N2 virus (MOI = 1) had minimal effect on cell viability (Fig. 2).Figure 2PM2.5 and H3N2 virus exposure caused damage in BEAS-2B cells: Cell viability (\({\overline{\text{X}}}\) ± SD, n = 3).Full size imageInfluence of PM2.5 on infectivity of H3N2 virus on BEAS-2B cellsTo assess whether exposure to PM2.5 could affect the ability of the H3N2 virus to infiltrate BEAS-2B, we first exposed them to PM2.5 (12.5 g/mL) for 4 h before infecting them with H3N2 (MOI = 1). As shown in Fig. 3A and B, co-exposure of BEAS-2B cells to PM2.5 and H3N2 virus increased 65.9% of virus-infected cells compared to H3N2 group alone (P < 0.05). It suggests that exposure to PM2.5 can increase the susceptibility of respiratory epithelial cells to IAV in co-exposure. This is consistent with what we found in our previous study28.Figure 3Influence of PM2.5 on infectivity of H3N2 virus BEAS-2B cells. (A) Cell morphology after IPMA. (B) PM2.5 exposure enhances H3N2 infectivity in BEAS-2B cells (n = 3, *P < 0.05, compared to H3N2 virus exposure).Full size imageAnalyses of gene expression and correlationsThe distribution of the gene expression data for all samples is displayed in boxplots. Gene expression levels of all samples were essentially the same after normalization, indicating that batch effect and systematic bias were not significant (Fig. 4A). The results of the principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that the control (MOCK) group, H3N2 group, PM2.5 group, and the co-exposure group (PM2.5 + H3N2) were well separated, indicating that there was a high degree of similarity among the samples in the same group and differences among different groups (Fig. 4B). As shown in Fig. 4C, the correlation coefficient between the samples was calculated by Pearson correlation analysis, and the closer the correlation coefficient is to 1, the higher the similarity between the samples, and the smaller the differences between the samples. The results show that biological experimental operations of the samples are highly repeatable and that samples in the same experimental group have a high degree of similarity.Figure 4Gene expression level, principal component analysis, and correlations among samples.

(C) The correlations among samples were analyzed by Pearson correlation.Full size imageScreen of DEGsIn PM2.5 group, 53 DEGs were detected in contrast to the control group, of which 30 were up-regulated and 23 were down-regulated. In H3N2 group, 54 DEGs were detected with 21 up-regulated and 33 down-regulated. In the co-exposure group, 97 DEGs were discovered compared with the control group, of which 45 were up-regulated and 52 down-regulated. Moreover, 52 DEGs were found between the co-exposure group and PM2.5 group, of which 22 were up-regulated and 30 down-regulated. 47 DEGs were found between the co-exposure group and H3N2 groups, of which 32 were up-regulated and 15 down-regulated (Fig. 5A–C). These DEGs could be divided into multiple sub-groups through a heat map of hierarchical cluster analysis (Fig. 5D–F). The top 10 DEGs in each comparison group are displayed in Tables 1, 2, 3.Figure 5Volcanic map of DEGs expression profiles among (A) Co-exposure and MOCK. (B) Co-exposure and PM2.5 exposure.

(C) Co-exposure and H3N2 virus exposure (Top 30 GO term).Full size imageBetween the co-exposure group and PM2.5 group, 103 enrichment sub-classes were identified, which were related to the biological process (59.22%), molecular function (25.24%), and cellular component (15.54%), such as transmembrane signaling receptor activity, activation of GTPase activity, positive regulation of cell migration, intracellular protein transport, and plasma membrane (Fig. 6B).Between the co-exposure group and H3N2 group, 119 enrichment sub-classes were identified, which were associated with the biological process accounting (68.07%), cellular component (8.10%), and molecular function (23.53%), such as extracellular matrix organization, cellular protein metabolism, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, and peptide hormone binding (Fig. 6C).KEGG pathway analysis of DEGsAnalysis of DEG-associated pathways was performed using the KEGG database to study the potential mechanism of the joint biological effects of PM2.5 exposure and H3N2 infection. It was revealed that biological systems related to DEGs between the co-exposure and the control groups included the endocrine system, digestive system, and immune system. Related metabolic processes including lipid metabolism, carbon metabolism, etc. DEG-related human diseases include viral, bacterial, and immune diseases. DEG-related environmental information processing included signal transduction, signal molecules and interaction, and cellular community-eukaryotes of cellular processes (Fig. 7A). Moreover, DEGs were significantly enriched in several related pathways (levle3), including the calcium signaling pathway, neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, complement and coagulation cascades, long-term potentiation, glucagon signaling pathway, and chemical carcinogenesis, among others. (Fig. 7B).Figure 7KEGG pathway classification (upper panel) and enrichment analysis (lower panel) of DEGs between Co-exposure and MOCK (A and B), Co-exposure and PM2.5 exposure (C and D), and Co-exposure and H3N2 virus exposure (E and F).Full size imageThe biological systems associated with DEGs between the co-exposure and PM2.5 groups included the immune system and endocrine system. DEG-associated human diseases included viral, bacterial, immune, and cancer. DEG-associated environmental information processing included signal transduction, signal molecules and interaction (Fig. 7C). Moreover, DEGs were significantly enriched in several related pathways (levle3), including the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, viral protein interaction with cytokine and cytokine receptors and epithelial cell signaling in Helicobacter pylori infection (Fig. 7D).Biological systems associated with DEGs between the co-exposure and H3N2 groups included the immune system and the endocrine system. DEG-associated human diseases included viral, bacterial, immune, and cancer. In addition, DEG-associated environmental information processing included signal transduction, and signal molecules and interaction (Fig. 7E). DEGs were significantly enriched in several related pathways (levle3), including neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450, complement and coagulation cascades, chemical carcinogenesis, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus, et al. (Fig. 7F).It is noteworthy that some differential genes and pathways were identified and enriched only in the co-exposure group through the discovery of DEGs and KEGG enrichment, KEGG pathways such as calcium signaling pathway, long-term potentiation, etc., and related DEGs including Adrenoceptor Alpha 1 Beta (ADRA1B), Adrenoceptor Beta 1 (ADRB1), Calcium/Calmodulin Dependent Protein Kinase II Beta (CAMK2B), etc., implying that the co-exposure of PM2.5 and H3N2 is more than just an additive effect.Gene set enrichment analysis (GESA) of DEGsThe samples were split into two groups in the gene expression matrix that served as the input for the GSEA analysis. Then, the genes in these two groups were all listed based on their values generated from GSEA analysis from large to small, respectively. Here, we can tell whether a pathway is activated or inhibited by simply looking at the value of its corresponding gene in the list. The gene with a large value was putatively considered as up-regulated. On the contrary, the gene with a smaller value was considered down-regulated.Compared with the control group, the up-regulated pathways in the co-exposure group included drug metabolism cytochrome P450, DNA replication, metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450, small cell lung cancer, base excision repair, autoimmune thyroid disease, antigen processing and presentation, and type I diabetes mellitus, the down-regulated pathways include steroid biosynthesis, biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction (Fig. 8A).Figure 8GSEA of DEGs between (A) Co-exposure and MOCK. (B) Co-exposure and PM2.5 exposure. (C) Co-exposure and H3N2 virus exposure (P < 0.05).Full size imageCompared with PM2.5 group, the up-regulated pathways in the co-exposure group included the chemokine signaling pathway, antigen processing and presentation, the down-regulated pathways include base excision repair, steroid biosynthesis, circadian rhythm mammal, insulin signaling pathway, JAK-STAT signaling pathway, and peroxisome (Fig. 8B).Compared with H3N2 group, the upregulated pathways in the co-exposure group included metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450, drug metabolism by cytochrome P450, antigen processing and presentation, and TGF -beta signaling pathway, the down-regulated pathways include epithelial cell signaling in helicobacter pylori infection, tight junction, and pathogenic Escherichia coli infection (Fig. 8C).Verification of DEGs using RT-PCRThe expression of some representative DEGs identified by transcriptomic methods within different groups was verified using RT-PCR. It was shown that mRNA levels of some DEGs including CYP1A1, CYPIB1 and Aldehyde Dehydrogenase 3 Family Member A1 (ALDH3A1) in the co-exposure group were significantly higher than those in the control group and H3N2 group. Such results provide clues for exploring the mode of action of PM2.5 in combined exposures.The mRNA level of Interleukin 21 Receptor (IL21R) was significantly higher in the PM2.5 exposure group and significantly lower in the H3N2 and co-exposure groups. Furthermore, the mRNA level of ADRB1 was significantly lower in the co-exposure group, but not in the exposure alone group (P < 0.05), and CAMK2B was similar, with a tendency of lower expression in the co-exposure group. (Fig. 9). These findings were in support of the results from RNA-seq, as depicted above.Figure 9mRNA expression analysis. Detection of mRNA expression in BEAS-2B cells by RT-PCR (n = 3, *P < 0.05, compared to MOCK).Full size imageDiscussionEven though PM2.5 air pollution has been significantly reduced in recent years, it remains a major threat to public health. A previous study has reported that PM2.5 has an impact on the infection and severity of infectious diseases29. In this study, we examined the joint effect of PM2.5 and H3N2 on gene transcription in human bronchial epithelial cells using RNA-seq. The results suggest that pleiotropic genes and pathways are involved in the promotive effect of PM2.5 on H3N2 infection of human bronchial epithelial cells.To explore the effect of PM2.5 exposure on H3N2 infection of BEAS-2B cells and the possible underlying mechanisms, we first examined the differential effect of the co-exposure group and PM2.5 group on gene expression, 22 DEGs are found up-regulated and 30 DEGs down-regulated between these two groups. Analysis of the related functions of these DEGs suggest H3N2 exposure may facilitate viral protein interaction with cytokine and cytokine receptor, and epithelial cell signaling in Helicobacter pylori infection in the co-exposure group are significantly enriched pathways. Whether H3N2 exposure modulates the effect of PM2.5 on BEAS-2B cells through signaling molecules and interaction of environmental information processing and bacterial infectious diseases is currently under the assumption.Previous studies have reported the interaction between viral and bacterial infections. TLR4 is proposed as unable to recognize viruses, but RSV infection has been shown to upregulate TLR4 expression, which increases inflammatory signaling and makes the respiratory system more sensitive to LPS, the major surface membrane component present in almost all Gram-negative bacteria and also a common biological component absorbed on PM2.5.30 Influenza infection followed by secondary bacterial pneumonia is associated with significant mortality and mortality. The susceptibility to bacterial infection may be increased by viral pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP) desensitization to TLRs. Desensitization results in reduced chemokine production and NF-κB activation31. The hygiene hypothesis for asthma pathogenesis is also based on the state of tolerance after repeated PAMP exposure, early exposure to viral PAMP may lessen the risk of developing high inflammation later in life32. In another of our previous experiments28, the effects of PM2.5 exposure on influenza virus (H3N2) infection and downstream regulation of inflammatory and antiviral immune responses were investigated, also using the human bronchial epithelial cell line BEAS-2B. The results showed that exposure to PM2.5 alone increased the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-8, but decreased the production of the antiviral cytokine interferon-β (IFN-β) in BEAS-2B cells. In contrast, exposure to H3N2 alone increased the production of IL-6, IL-8, and IFN-β. In this study, PM2.5 exposure significantly increased IL21R expression, whereas IL21R expression was decreased in both groups with H3N2 exposure. A recent study has shown that IL-21R signaling suppresses IL-17+ gamma delta T cell responses and production of IL-17 related cytokines in the lung at steady state and after influenza A virus infection33. These findings suggest that H3N2 may influence the effects on cells via signaling molecules and environmental information processing with bacterial infectious diseases interactions of viral proteins with cytokines and cytokine receptors, and epithelial cell signaling in combined exposures.Meanwhile, we identified 32 up-regulated and 15 down-regulated DEGs between the co-exposure group and the H3N2 group. The metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450, complement and coagulation cascades, and chemical carcinogenesis are significantly enriched pathways associated with these DEGs. Whether PM2.5 exposure modulates the response of BEAS-2B cells to H3N2 through the pathways regulated by cytochrome P450 metabolism, respiratory immune system, or cancer-related diseases, needs to be clarified in the future.Moreover, the expression of some DEGs in BEAS-2B cells exposed to PM2.5 and H3N2 are examined using RT-PCR. Similar to the results from RNA-seq, mRNA levels of CYP1A1 and ALDH3A1 in the co-exposure group, those of CYP1B1 and ALDH3A1 H3N2 group are significantly higher than those in the control group, respectively. KEGG indicates that the pathway related to ALDH3A1 is associated with the metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450 and chemical carcinogenesis. Additionally, differential expression of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 is detected between the co-exposure group and control group or H3N2 group, respectively. The CYP1 (cytochrome P450 1) family has two significant subtypes, CYP1A1 and CYP1B1, which are abundant in lung tissues. CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 participate in the metabolism of lung polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) as PAHs-sensitive genes and can be activated by PAHs in the lung through the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)34,35,36. CYP1A1 is most abundant in alveolar type II cells and endothelial cells37, while CYP1B1 is most abundant in airway epithelial cells35. Interestingly, PAH content contributes to PM2.5 toxicity, and recent research has shown that PAHs in PM are a powerful mediator of health effects38,39,40,41. Mice exposed to high PM concentrations in Fresno, California were found to increase CYP1A1 expression in pulmonary tissues, including pulmonary blood vessels, parenchyma tissue, and airways42. Another study found that CYP1B1, as an enzyme with a unique tumor-specific expression pattern, can bioactivate a wide range of carcinogenic compounds. Inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and AhR ligands co-regulate CYP1B1 expression and change the metabolism of exogenous carcinogens, increase the biological activity of promutagens, such as benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) in epithelial cells43. Recent studies have shown that CYP450 is able to influence macrophage inflammatory signaling through the PPARa axis, which may explain how PM2.5 affects the role of H3N2 viruses in co-exposure44. These findings imply that the action pattern of PM2.5 may be closely related to the metabolism of cytochrome P450 in the context of co-exposure to H3N2 and PM2.5.Notably, this study discovered that some differential genes and pathways were identified and enriched only in the common exposure group, KEGG pathways such as calcium signaling pathway, long-term potentiation, and related DEGs including ADRA1B, ADRB1, CAMK2B, and so on, and the results of RT-PCR assay confirmed the DEGs differences among them. ADRA1B and ADRB1 belong to the G protein-coupled receptor adrenergic receptor group and GO annotations for this gene include G protein-coupled receptor activity α1 adrenergic receptor activity, and β adrenergic receptor activity. Calmodulin-dependent kinases (CaMK) are a family of serinehreonine kinases that mediate many of the second messenger effects of Ca2+. Recent studies have demonstrated that CAMK2B expression is modified in neuropsychiatric illnesses and potentially affects synaptic plasticity45. These findings suggest that co-exposure to PM2.5 and H3N2 may be able to affect the calcium-sensing receptor on the cell surface by modulating Ca2+, which, as a typical nutrient-sensing G-protein-coupled receptor, is activated and modulated by a wide range of endogenous or exogenous substances (e.g., cations, amino acids, polyamines, aminoglycoside antibiotics, etc.), resulting in an "additional" effect46. Its specific mechanisms will be investigated further.In conclusion, PM and H3N2 still pose serious risks to public health, but the mechanisms of their combined action remain largely unknown. This study profiles the transcriptome of human bronchial epithelial cells exposed to PM2.5 influenza virus (H3N2) by RNA-Seq. The results indicate that PM2.5 exposure disrupts the expression of CYP-coding genes, further altering the body's metabolism of exogenous harmful substances, and leading to the intensification of H3N2 invasion of BEAS-2B cells. Meanwhile, by working as a PAMP, H3N2 exposure might influence the immune system's response to PM2.5 that contains bacterial pathogens or LPS. We also found that the combined effects of PM2.5 and H3N2 are not simply additive and that the combined exposure of the two may have an "additional" effect by modulating Ca2+ to affect G protein-coupled receptors on the cell surface. The exploration of the joint effects of PM2.5 and H3N2 may provide insights into the pathophysiological basis of the interaction between PM and influenza virus, as well as for developing efficient strategies to prevent the adverse respiratory effects caused by PM2.5 and H3N2 viruses.Materials and methodsPM2.5 collection and suspension preparationQuartz sampling filters were used to collect PM2.5 in January and March 2021 using a TischTE-6070 high-flow particle sampler (Tisch Environmental, USA) with a flow rate of 1.13 m3/min. After sample collection, the quartz sampling filter was submerged in a Petri dish 10 cm in diameter filled with ultrapure water and sonicated three times for five minutes each. The suspension was filtered through six layers of gauze and then underwent lyophilization to collect PM2.5 powder using a vacuum freeze drier (Christ, Germany) for 24 h. PM2.5 was thoroughly suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, Solarbio Life Sciences, China) solution at a final concentration of 1 mg/mL. The suspension was aliquoted and stored in a -80 freezer. Before use, PM2.5 suspension was vortexed for homogenization.Analysis of PM2.5 component1.0 mg of PM2.5 was digested in the mixture of 65% HNO3 and 30% H2O2 (3:2). The digestion condition in the microwave was 160 °C for 20 min and 140 °C for another 2 h. Metals in PM2.5 including magnesium (Mg), aluminum (Al), calcium (Ca), manganese (Mn), barium (Ba), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), strontium (Sr), tin (Sn), lead (Pb), etc. were measured with inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS, NCS testing technology, China).Cell culture and treatmentBEAS-2B cells (ATCC, Rockville, Maryland, USA) were used as the in vitro cell model and cultured in a cell incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin. Cells were grown in 12-well plates at a density of 105/mL. Upon 90% confluence, the cells were subjected to the following treatments: serum-free medium (control group, mock), PM2.5 (12.5 μg/mL), H3N2 (MOI = 1), or co-exposure of PM2.5 (12.5 μg/mL) and H3N2 (MOI = 1).Cytotoxicity assayCell counting kit-8 (CCK-8, Shanghai Omo Biotech) was used to evaluate the cytotoxicity of PM2.5 and H3N2, respectively. In detail, 100 μL of 105 cells /mL BEAS-2B cells were seeded into each well of a 96-wells plate and cultured at 37 °C in an incubator. Upon 90% confluence, the cells were incubated with different concentrations of PM2.5 (0, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, 100 μg/mL), H3N2 (1 MOI), and co-exposure of PM2.5 (12.5 μg/mL) and H3N2 (MOI = 1) for 24 h, respectively. The optical density at 450 nm was measured with an enzyme-labeled instrument (PerkinElmer, USA), and the cytotoxicity was calculated according to the manufacturer’s instructions.Immunoperoxidase monolayer cell assay (IPMA)IPMA with 3-Amino-9-Ethylcarbazole (AEC) peroxidase substrate as the chromogenic solution was used to visualize H3N2-infected BEAS-2B cells. The 12-well plate was cleaned once with PBS before addition of 5% skimmed milk to each well, and the wells were then blocked in a thermostat at 37 °C for 1 h. After blocking, monoclonal antibodies against hemagglutinin of H3N2 were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, and then washed five times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 (PBST). Goat anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) antibody (Beyotime, China) was added and incubated for another 1 h at 37 °C. AEC chromogenic solution (Affinity Biosciences, USA) was applied to identify the infected cells. The number of infected cells was counted under a microscope (Leica, Germany) which showing a brownish-red color after treatment with AEC chromogenic solution were observed and counted. The average number of H3N2-infected cells per microscopic field was determined according to a protocol for a systematic randomization procedure47, and 8 images were recorded for each experimental group, from 3 independent experiments.RNA isolation and library preparationTotal RNA was extracted using the miRNA Isolation Kit (mirVana™, Ambion-1561) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer was used to assess the purity and quantity of RNA (Thermo Scientific, USA). The Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer was used to evaluate the integrity of the RNA (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The mRNA libraries were then created using the TruSeq Stranded mRNA LT Sample Prep Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) for carrying out the transcriptome sequencing and analysis (OE Biotech Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China).Quality control and RNA sequencingPCA was used to analyze gene expression data and used to measure the distance between the samples in order to identify sample similarities. Pearson correlation analysis was used to calculate the correlation coefficients between samples, and the correlation between samples represents the degree of similarity between samples, and the similarity of samples from various treatments or tissues in terms of expression levels. The correlation of biological duplicates can be used to not only examine the reproducibility of biological experimental manipulations but also to evaluate the dependability of differentially expressed genes and to aid in the screening of aberrant samples.On the Illumina HiSeq X Ten platform, the mRNA libraries were sequenced, and 150 bp paired-end reads were generated. The HiSeq X Ten System was specially created for population-scale whole-genome sequencing. Each HiSeq X System is capable of 30-fold or greater coverage of human genome sequencing. Trimmomatic48 was utilized for the processing of raw data (raw reads). To get the clean reads, the low-quality reads and reads containing ploy-N were eliminated. The human genome (GRCh38) was then mapped using HISAT249 using the clean reads. FPKM50 of each gene was calculated using Cufflinks51, and the read counts of each gene were obtained by HTSeqcount52. Differential expression analysis was performed using the DESeq (2012) R package.Differential expression gene (DEG) analysisOnly genes with count mean values larger than 2 were kept for the subsequent study after the genes had initially been filtered based on the count's mean value. The DESeq software was used to normalize the counts of each sample gene (the BaseMean value was used to estimate the expression), the difference fold was calculated and the NB (negative binomial distribution test) was used to test the significance of differences. Finally, the differential protein-coding genes were screened based on the fold and significance test results. For screening differences, the default parameters were P < 0.05 and |Log2foldchange|> 1. The expression pattern of genes in different groups and samples was displayed using hierarchical cluster analysis of DEGs.GO and KEGG enrichment analysisR software was used to analyze the DEGs' Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment based on the hypergeometric distribution. GO enrichment and KEGG53 pathway enrichment analysis of DEGs were performed respectively using R based on the hypergeometric distribution. Biological process, cellular composition, and molecular function, the three categories of GO functional annotations, were all covered. The pathway diagram was derived from the KEGG database.Gene set enrichment analysisFor Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), the GSEA software (version 3.0) was used to divide the samples into two groups according to the presence or absence of PM2.5 exposure and download the samples from Molecular Signatures Database (http://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/downloads.jsp)54, the c2.cp.kegg.v7.4.symbols.gmt subset was downloaded to evaluate relevant pathways and molecular mechanisms based on gene expression profiles and phenotypic groupings, setting a minimum gene set of 5 and a maximum gene set of 5000. One thousand resamples with P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.Real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)Each RT reaction contained 10 μL of 5 × TransScript All-in-one SuperMix for qPCR, 2 μL of 0.5 μg RNA, and 0.5 μL of gDNA Remover. In a GeneAmp® PCR System 9700 (Applied Biosystems, USA), reactions were carried out for 15 min at 42 °C and 5 s at 85 °C. After being diluted 10 times in nuclease-free water, the 10 μL RT reaction mix was kept at -20 °C.RT-PCR was carried out using the LightCycler® 480 II Real-time PCR Instrument (Roche, Switzerland) and a 10 μL PCR reaction mixture that contained 1 μL of cDNA, 5 μL of 2 × PerfectStart™ Green qPCR SuperMix, 0.2 μL of forward primer, 0.2 μL of reverse primer, and 3.6 μL of nuclease-free water. In a 384-well optical plate (Roche, Switzerland), reactions were incubated for 30 s at 94 °C, then underwent 45 cycles of 5 s at 94 °C and 30 s at 60 °C. Each sample was run in triplicate for analysis. Melting curve analysis was performed following the PCR cycles to confirm the precise generation of the desired PCR product. mRNA sequences obtained from the NCBI database served as the basis for the design of primer sequences. The primer sequences are shown in Table 4. The expression levels of mRNAs were normalized to ACTB (β-actin) and calculated using the 2-ΔΔCt method. Table 4 RT-PCR primers.Full size tableStatistical analysisSPSS 22.0 (IBM, USA) and GraphPad Prism8 (GraphPad Software, USA) statistical software was used to process the experimental data, analyze the variables, and create graphs. Data with a normal distribution were expressed as mean and standard deviation (\({\overline{\text{X}}}\) ± SD). ANOVA was applied to compare the cell viability of each group, and the Games-Howell method was used to compare the groups pairwise. The t-test of two independent samples was used to compare the numbers of virus-infected cells between the combined group and H3N2 virus group in the IPMA assay, with α = 0.05.

Egg Producers AssociationCBC News · Posted: Nov 08, 2023 4:51 PM EST | Last Updated: November 8, 2023Cases of the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain of avian flu have been detected at 16 farms in B.C. since late October. (Jay-Dee/Shutterstock)Social SharingAvian flu is spreading rapidly again through poultry farms in British Columbia, with the virus discovered in half a dozen commercial flocks this week alone.Birds at eight commercial poultry farms in the Fraser Valley and small flocks in both Merritt and Port McNeill have also recently tested positive for avian influenza, bringing the total number of confirmed outbreaks to 16 since late October, according to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA). The affected farms in the Fraser Valley include operations in Chilliwack, Agassiz, Mission, Abbotsford and Langley. The birds tested positive for the highly pathenogenic H5N1 strain, which was first detected in Canada in 2021 and has since led to the loss of millions of birds. H5N1, which is spread through contact with an infected bird or its feces or nasal secretions, is highly contagious and deadly to birds. In October, farmers were ordered by B.C.'s chief veterinarian to take extra precautions to reduce the risk of transmitting the virus, including restricting poultry events and keeping birds indoors. Avian flu outbreaks are more likely to occur during fall, when migrating wild birds can pass it on to poultry farms or backyard flocks. Avian flu detected on poultry farm in ChilliwackMark Siemens, president of the B.C. Egg Producers Association, says farmers in the province are expecting the spread to be particularly bad this year. "We are preparing ourselves for a long and difficult fall and winter," said Siemens, who owns a chicken farm in Abbotsford. He says experiencing an outbreak at this time of year is devastating for farmers, as it could mean the loss of their entire operation through the holiday season. "It's also animals that you care about and that you've really invested your time and energy into, so it is a very mentally and emotionally straining time for these producers," he said.Avian flu threat fades on farms but may be back in the fallAround 370,000 birds have already been euthanized since October due to avian flu, according to Amanda Brittain from the B.C. Poultry Association. She says this is unlikely to affect chicken prices in grocery stores. "We're very lucky in Canada to have supply management for poultry and that keeps pricing somewhat stable," said Brittain. The outbreak during the fall and winter of 2022-23 season resulted in about three million birds being culled in B.C. The province's worst season on record, in 2004, saw 17 million birds being destroyed. B.C.'s Ministry of Agriculture says farmers need to remain vigilant, and any sick or dead bird should be reported through the province's wild bird surveillance hotline at 1-866-431-2473.

According to the B.C. Centre for Disease Control, there were 144 new COVID-19 hospitalizations in the week ending on Nov. 4. (Ben Nelms/CBC)Social SharingClose to 1,073,000 doses of influenza vaccine and almost 850,000 COVID-19 vaccines have been administered to British Columbians since the province's fall vaccination program started six weeks ago, health officials say.The numbers were revealed by Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix at a media conference updating the status of the current respiratory illness season and provincial vaccine campaign.COVID-19 levels hit a peak in early October, according to Henry, but have now started coming down. As of Nov. 9, there were 244 patients in hospital, eight of those in critical care."Our hospitalizations are primarily in people who are over age 60, and particularly, most of the severe illness is in older people over age 80," said Henry."Although I have to say unvaccinated people at any age remain at greatest risk and highest risk of having more severe illness, ending up in hospital as well, and with the potential of having long COVID."According to the B.C. Centre for Disease Control, there were 144 new COVID-19 hospitalizations in the week ending on Nov. 4, fewer than half the 296 hospitalizations three weeks earlier.Here's what you need to know about booking your next COVID-19 vaccine in B.C.Among those tested for COVID-19 under the province's medical services plan, positive tests dropped to 15.8 per cent, compared with a peak of 23.4 per cent five weeks earlier.There were 36 deaths among people with COVID-19 last week, down from a peak of 70 two weeks earlier, although the BCCDC cautions the information in both weeks is preliminary.Flu vaccine a good match for viruses circulating: HenryHenry said in terms of other infectious diseases, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) was starting to rise in children but is relatively low across all age groups.Influenza activity is also starting to increase, she said, but remains low and at a level comparable with before the COVID-19 pandemic. No vaccine appointments available until December? You can either wait, or take a road tripAbout 80 per cent of the flu virus being detected are influenza A or the H1N1 strain. Henry said rates of influenza B are low and the rare influenza B Yamagata strain has not been detected."Interestingly ... we haven't seen it worldwide in the last two years. So that's an interesting phenomenon that we're watching as well," she said.Henry said based on the early data, this year's flu vaccine is a good match for fighting the viruses going around. Avian influenza on the rise in B.C. with 16 outbreaks reported since OctoberShe also stressed that people living near or working in poultry farms should get the flu vaccine to protect against H5N1 avian influenza that has decimated 16 poultry farms in B.C. so far this fall. On rare occasions, H5N1 can transmit to humans. "It's very concerning at this time of year when we're starting to see human influenza viruses circulating. We really urge people working with birds to prioritize getting your vaccines and making sure you're not a potential source of infections to the flocks as well," said Henry. Outbreaks at health facilitiesHenry said although there have been a number of COVID-19 outbreaks declared at health facilities, the level of illness has generally been less severe than in the past. On Thursday, a COVID-19 outbreak was declared at the Saanich Peninsula Hospital's centre unit where 15 infected people experienced mild illness, according to regional authority Island Health. The hospital is around 20 kilometres north of downtown Victoria.A COVID-19 outbreak was declared at the Saanich Peninsula Hospital, pictured here on Google Street View. Fifteen infected people experienced mild illness, according Island Health. (Google)There are also ongoing COVID-19 outbreaks at Abbotsford Regional and Chilliwack General hospitals in the Fraser Health region.Dix said despite a few glitches, the provincial vaccination booking system was working well and more appointment spaces were being added in places like Oliver, Osoyoos, Peachland, Courtenay and Lake Cowichan, where demand has outstripped supply at times.He said on Thursday, more than 30,000 people received vaccinations and more than 26,000 appointment spaces were added to the system.

A 10km Surveillance Zone is in place around the property; the 3km Protection Zone has now been lifted. Bird-keepers are encouraged to maintain rigorous biosecurity measures. And the public is advised to stay vigilant around dead wild birds. If you own birds If you suspect any type of avian influenza in poultry or captive birds you must report it immediately by calling the Defra Rural Services Helpline on 03000 200 301. It is vital that everyone who owns birds maintains strong biosecurity to limit the risk of the disease spreading. Find biosecurity advice on the Animal and Plant Health Agency website. If you have not already, you should register your poultry, even if only kept as pets, so you can be contacted you during an outbreak locally. This is a legal requirement if you have 50 or more birds. Wild birds Do not touch or pick up any dead or visibly sick birds that you find. If you find dead wild waterfowl (swans, geese or ducks) or other dead wild birds, such as gulls or birds of prey, you should report them online or to the Defra helpline on 03459 33 55 77. Defra will then collect some of these birds and test them to understand how the disease is distributed geographically and in different types of bird. Not all birds will be collected and those that aren’t are the landowner’s responsibility to safely dispose of. Public health The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has said that avian influenza is primarily a disease of birds and the risk to the general public’s health is very low. The Food Standards Agency has said that on the basis of the current scientific evidence, avian influenza poses a very low food safety risk for UK consumers. Properly cooked poultry and poultry products, including eggs, are safe to eat. Find more advice for members of the public on the Animal and Plant Health Agency website. Other pets Avian flu primarily effects birds and there is little risk to other pets. There have been no confirmed reports of avian flu spreading to dogs. However, as a precaution, keep your dog away from any dead wild birds you may come across. If you live within the 3km Protection Zone, you are advised to walk your dog on a lead. There have been some cases of avian influenza H5N1 spreading to cats from eating infected wild birds, although these are not widespread. If you live within the 3km Protection Zone, you may want to consider keeping your cat indoors if it is known to catch wild birds.

In a memorandum circular released by the Department of Agriculture, the vaccination program would "preempt" potential bird flu outbreaks in "highly" vulnerable areas to avoid substantial economic losses. The said guidelines were signed on November 3. Depending on the virus’ risk, the DA identified the priority groups for the vaccine use. The DA also said that the two types of vaccination are the protective emergency and preventive vaccination. The kinds of vaccines allowed, on the other hand, are vector vaccines, killed/inactivated vaccines and recombinant vaccines. The following avian types are eligible for vaccination: commercial layer chicken layer breeder broiler breeder colored/free-range breeder grandparent broiler breeder small-hold layerative chicken duck game fowl turkey goose However, commercial broiler chicken, small-hold broiler, quail, pigeon, and exotic birds are not eligible for the vaccine. The bird flu has affected the world supply with over 131 million poultry killed according to the World Health Organization. Bird flu outbreaks in the country frequently lead to substantial losses for poultry owners and farmers, causing a significant economic impact. The recurring nature of these incidents has made bird flu a recurring challenge for the nation's poultry industry.
