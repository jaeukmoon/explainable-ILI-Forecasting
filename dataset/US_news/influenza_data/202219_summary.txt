Genomic Variability during the 1918 Pandemic: Researchers have analyzed archival influenza virus genomes from Europe during the 1918 influenza pandemic. The analysis revealed genomic variability, indicating a combination of local transmission and long-distance dispersal events.
Possible Adaptation of 1918 Influenza Virus to Humans: The analysis also showed variation in the nucleoprotein gene of the 1918 influenza virus, which is associated with resistance to host antiviral response. This variation suggests a possible adaptation of the virus to humans.
Origin of Seasonal H1N1 Influenza A Virus: Local molecular clock modeling suggests that seasonal H1N1 influenza A virus descended directly from the 1918 pandemic virus, rather than originating through reassortment within the subtype.
Impact of the 1918 Pandemic: The 1918 influenza pandemic was the deadliest respiratory pandemic of the 20th century, causing the death of 50-100 million people worldwide. It affected young, healthy adults more severely than other age groups.
Archival influenza virus genomes are valuable resources for understanding the dynamics of past pandemics and can help inform predictions and preparations for future influenza outbreaks.
