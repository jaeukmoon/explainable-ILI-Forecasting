Purpose of Pandemic Influenza: A pandemic influenza occurs when a new influenza A virus emerges that can easily infect and spread among people. This can result in a global outbreak, and because the virus is new, few people have immunity and a vaccine may not be widely available.

Characteristics of Pandemic Influenza: The severity of a pandemic depends on the characteristics of the virus, the immunity of individuals, and the health and age of those infected. Certain chronic health conditions can make individuals more susceptible to serious infections. Pandemics are rare and occurred only three times in the 20th century.

Immunity and Complications: Seasonal flu provides some immunity due to previous exposures and vaccinations, but in a pandemic, most people have little or no immunity. Therefore, healthy individuals also face a high risk of complications.

Medical Care and Vaccines: During seasonal flu, healthcare providers and hospitals can generally meet the needs of the public, but in a pandemic, these systems may be overwhelmed. Vaccines are available for seasonal flu, but they may not be available in the early stages of a pandemic. Antiviral supplies may also be inadequate.

Impact on Public Health and Societal Factors: The rates of medical visits, complications, hospitalizations, and deaths can vary during a pandemic. The impact on schools and workplaces is usually minor during seasonal flu, but in a pandemic, there may be travel restrictions and closures of schools and businesses. The economic impact can be severe.
