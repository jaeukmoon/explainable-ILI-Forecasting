Arginase 1 (ARG1) plays a crucial role in the resolution of lung inflammation. However, whether vagal-α7nAChR signaling can regulate lung inflammation and ARG1 expression during an influenza infection is elusive. Here, we found that lung and spleen IL-4+ cells and lung ARG1 expression were reduced; however, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) protein and leukocytes and lung inflammatory cytokines were increased in PR8 (A/Puerto Rico/8/1934, H1N1)-infected vagotomized mice when compared to the control. In PR8-infected α7nAChR-deficient mice, lung Arg1, Il10, and Socs3 expression and BAL Ly6C+CD206+ cells were reduced. PR8-infected Chrna7+/+ recipient mice reconstituted with Chrna7−/− bone marrow had a lower survival as compared to PR8-infected Chrna7+/+ recipient mice reconstituted with Chrna7+/+ bone marrow. Mechanistically, the activation of α7nAChR by its agonist GTS-21 could enhance IL-4-induced Arg1 expression, reduced Nos2, and TNF-α expression in PR8-infected bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM). Stimulation with IL-4 increased phosphorylation of STAT6 and activation of α7nAChR increased STAT6 binding with the ARG1 promoter and relieved IL-4-induced H3K27me3 methylation by increasing JMJD3 expression in PR8-infected BMDM. Inhibition of JMJD3 increased H3K27me3 methylation and abolished α7nAChR activation and IL-4 induced ARG1 expression. Activation of α7nAChR also reduced phosphorylation of AKT1 and contained FOXO1 in the nucleus. Knockdown of Foxo1a reduced α7nAChR activation and IL-4 induced Arg1 expression in PR8-infected BMDM. Therefore, vagal-α7nAChR signaling is a novel therapeutic target for treating lung inflammatory responses during an influenza infection. You have full access to this article via your institution.

Influenza viruses replicate in the bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells and induce inflammatory responses in the neighboring pulmonary macrophages (MΦ). MΦ activation can be classified into ‘classical activation’ (M1 phenotype) and ‘alternative activation’ (M2 phenotype). LPS and IFN-γ can induce MΦ to be polarized into M1 MΦ. M1 MΦ could upregulate the expression of NOS2 and proinflammatory cytokines (such as TNF-α, IL-6, and CXCL2). In addition, interleukin-4 (IL-4) and IL-13 are capable of inducing the differentiation of MΦ into M2 MΦ. M2 MΦ could express high levels of IL-10, SOCS3, and arginase 1 (ARG1), which promote anti-inflammatory responses related to tissue healing and repair [1]. As a result, M2 MΦ could inhibit influenza virus-mediated lethal lung inflammatory responses and damage [2].In the past decades, Tracey and his colleagues have found that the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway via the regulatory hub-spleen plays an important role in regulating systemic proinflammatory responses [3,4,5]. But, another study has shown that vagal efferent neurons in a rat model neither synapse with splenic sympathetic neurons nor drive their ongoing activity [6]. Besides innervating the spleen, the vagus nerve can innervate the distal airway and even the alveoli [7] and airway sensors [8]. The vagal circuits between the lung and nervous centers in the nodose ganglion and the nucleus of solitary tract in the brain stem form a unique machinery named the pulmonary parasympathetic inflammatory reflex [9, 10]. Studies have shown that vagotomy and the knockout of α7nAChR can aggravate lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or Escherichia coli-induced acute lung injury (ALI) [11, 12]. The α7nAChR+CD11b+ cells are important players in mediating the protective effects of vagal-α7nAChR signaling [10].Some reports have shown that prestimulation of human MΦ with acetylcholine could attenuate influenza virus-mediated release of proinflammatory cytokines [13] as the activation of α7nAChR promotes LPS-induced conversion of M1 MΦ to M2 [14]. PNU-282987 (an α7nAChR agonist) treatment reduced lung mRNA levels and the frequency of M1 MΦ, whereas cells expressing the M2-related markers, ARG1 (arginase 1), CD206 [15], and IL-10, were increased in the LPS-induced lung injury model [16]. However, whether vagal-α7nAChR signaling can regulate lung inflammation and ARG1 expression (as a key indicator of M2 MΦ activation) during an influenza infection is unknown.It has been reported that STAT6 phosphorylation enhances the expression of ARG1 in IL-4-stimulated MΦ [17]. In addition, that FOXO1 and H3K27me3 epigenetic modification might regulate the transcription of ARG1 in MΦ [18, 19]. Another study has shown that the Jmjd3-Irf4 axis regulates M2 MΦ polarization and host responses against helminth infection [20]. Also, AKT signaling has been reported to be an important factor in MΦ activation and M1/M2 polarization [21] as AKT could phosphorylate FOXO and lead to the exclusion of FOXO from the nucleus to cytoplasm, hence contributing to M2 MΦ activation [22]. Therefore, whether these factors would affect vagal-α7nAChR signaling-regulated ARG1 expression during an influenza infection is worthy of investigation.Here, we hypothesized that the disruption of vagal-α7nAChR signaling would worsen influenza-induced lung inflammation and that the activation of α7nAChR would boost IL-4-induced ARG1 expression in PR8-infected MΦ. Therefore, we studied the following: (1) whether or not vagotomy and deletion of Chrna7 would affect influenza-induced lung inflammation and ARG1 expression; (2) whether or not the activation of α7nAChR would affect IL-4-induced ARG1 expression in PR8 or Poly I:C-challenged BMDM; (3) whether or not the activation of α7nAChR would influence the binding of STAT6 with the ARG1 promoter in influenza-infected MΦ; and (4) whether or not the activation of α7nAChR would affect AKT1-FOXO1 signaling or JMJD3-H3K27me3 methylation during IL-4-induced ARG1 expressionIn this study, we have demonstrated that vagotomy reduced lung IL-4 and ARG1 expression, increased bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) protein and leukocytes and lung inflammatory cytokines during a PR8 infection. In PR8-α7nAChR-deficient mice, lung Arg1, Il10, and Socs3 expression and BAL Ly6C+CD206+ cells were reduced. PR8-infected Chrna7+/+ mice reconstituted with Chrna7−/− bone marrow had a lower survival rate. In the in vitro study, the activation of α7nAChR could enhance IL-4-induced Arg1 expression, reduced Nos2 and TNF-α expression in PR8-infected MΦ. Mechanistically, activation of α7nAChR increased STAT6 binding with the ARG1 promoter, increased FOXO1 retention in the nucleus, reduced H3K27me3 methylation, and therefore boosted IL-4 induced ARG1 expression in the PR8-infected MΦ. These finding suggest that vagal-α7nAChR signaling is a novel therapeutic target for treating influenza lung inflammation.Materials and methodsAnimalsC57BL/6 mice were housed in groups with 12-h dark–light cycles and with free access to food. Chrna7-deficient (B6.129S7-Chrna7tm1Bay) and LysMCre mice from a C57BL/6 background were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Akt1fl/fl mice were obtained from Professor Zhong-zhou Yang, Model Animal Research Center, Nanjing University. The operations were performed under anesthesia which was induced with an intraperitoneal (IP) injection of pentobarbital sodium (50 mg/kg). The Committees on Animal Research of the Institut Pasteur of Shanghai, Chinese Academy of Sciences, approved of the protocols (Permit Number: A2014009).ReagentsThe Phospho-AKT1 (Ser473) (D7F10) XP Rabbit mAb was obtained from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA). Arginase I (H-52), STAT6 (S-20), AKT1 (C-20), p-FKHR (Ser 256), and FKHR (H-128) antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). GTS-21 dihydrochloride (DMBX-A), anti-STAT6 (phospho Y641), anti-KDM6B/JMJD3, anti-Histone H3 (tri-methyl K27), and anti-Choline Acetyltransferase [EPR13024(B)] were from ABCAM (Cambridge, MA). Mouse TNF alpha ELISA Ready-SET-Go, mouse IL-4 Recombinant Protein, anti-mouse antigen F4/80 eFlour 450® antibody, anti-mouse Ly-6G (Gr-1), anti-mouse Ly-6C, anti-mouse CD11b, anti-mouse IL-4, anti-Mouse CD11c FITC, and anti-human/mouse CD45R (B220) were from eBioscince (San Diego, CA). The Poly(I:C) (LMW) was from InvivoGen (San Diego, CA). The APC anti-mouse CD206 (MMR) was from Biolegend (San Diego, CA). Rabbit (DA1E) mAb IgG XP Isotype Controls were from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA). The Mouse/Rat CCR2 Phycoerythrin MAb (Clone 475301) was from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN) and the CF633-α-Bungarotoxin was from Biotium (Hayward, CA).Bone marrow chimera experimentsTo test the role of α7nAChR of bone marrow cells in mediating IAV-induced lung inflammation, the Chrna7+/+ recipient mice were lethally irradiated (6 Gy), to destroy their bone marrow, and randomly divided into two groups. Then, these mice received either Chrna7+/+ or Chrna7−/− bone marrow donor cells (5 × 106 in each mouse) by a retro-orbital injection to reconstitute their bone marrow. The mice were administered antibiotic-treated water for 3 weeks and then used for experiments at ~8 weeks after bone marrow transplantation. Using this protocol, at 8 weeks after bone marrow transplantation, more than 90% of the circulating hematopoietic cells were of donor origin.Unilateral vagotomyAs we previously reported [10], right or sham cervical vagotomy was performed with the animals under anesthesia (IP injection of pentobarbital sodium, 50 mg/kg). The procedure involved a longitudinal midline incision in the ventral region of the neck. Using blunt dissection, the overlying muscles and fascia were separated until the right vagus and carotid artery were visible. The vagus was carefully stripped away from the carotid artery and lightly cut off from the vagotomy group. The vagus was kept intact in the sham group. The incision was sutured with a 7–0 silk thread. The respiration rhythm was not affected by the unilateral vagotomy. It was reported that the right nerve controls cardiac function and thus this side was not chosen for vagus nerve stimulation. In our study, upon comparing sham to vagotomy mice receiving an intratracheal instillation of saline, there was no difference in BAL cytokines and inflammatory cell profiles within 24 h. No mice died of heart failure after operating on the right side for the vagotomy.Influenza viral propagationThe influenza virus, mouse adapted A/Puerto Rico/8/1934(H1N1), was kindly provided by Dr. Ertl HC [23] (Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA, USA). PR8 was propagated in a 10-day-old chicken embryo from specific-pathogen-free flocks (Beijing Merial, China). Each egg was injected with 0.1 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing ~103 infectious particles, incubated at 37 °C with forced air circulation and egg rotation, and maintained at 4 °C for 12 h before harvesting. The allantoic fluid was harvested separately from each egg. Those with high hemagglutinin activity were pooled, and aliquots were prepared and stored at −80 °C. The hemagglutinin titer of the above subtype of influenza virus was measured with 1% chicken blood cell in a V-shaped plate.Isolation and culture of BMDMBMDMs were obtained by in vitro differentiation of the primary femur and tibia BM cells as previously described [24]. Briefly, femurs and tibiae from wild type, Chrna7−/− and LysMcre+Akt1fl/fl mice were dissected, cleaned, disinfected in 70% ethanol, and washed with fully supplemented RPMI-1640 medium. After lysing erythrocytes, the BM cells were then cultured in a Petri dish (at a density of 4 × 106 cells/10 cm dish) supplemented with 30% L929 cell-conditioned medium. This medium contained high levels of M-CSF, because murine bone marrow MΦ, or human monocytes treated with M-CSF, differentiate into MΦ with an M2-like phenotype, while those treated with GM-CSF differentiate into a mixed population of dendritic cells and M1-like MΦ [25]. Cells were matured to phenotypic MΦ over 6 days. Adherent cells were recovered and infected with PR8 for the experiments.Treatment strategy of BMDMAs Fig. 4b shows, we set up eight treatment strategies: the BMDMs (5 × 105/well) received α7nAChR activation with GTS-21 (25 μM in PBS) for 30 min, IL-4 stimulation (10 ng/mL in PBS) for 6 h, and then PR8 (2 MOI in PBS) influenza challenge for 18 h. The specific treatments were listed in each figure. The cells were collected after a 24-h culture was created to extract RNA and protein for analysis.Animal viral infectionMale 8–10-week-old wild type, Chrna7−/−, or vagotomized mice (with a C57BL/6J background) were used in the different experimental conditions. Mice were anesthetized and then intranasally given either a PR8 1.4 × 104 FFU (in 20 µL chorioallantoic fluid) or vehicle.Bronchoalveolar lavageAs described previously [12], BAL was done after euthanizing the mice and then placing a 20-gauge catheter into the trachea through which 1 mL of cold PBS was flushed back and forth three times. A BAL supernatant was used for measuring protein concentration. The BAL cells were quantified and lysed for Western blotting analysis.Preparing single cells from the digested lungsLungs were removed and washed twice in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 1% penicillin or streptomycin. The excised lungs were minced, ground, and then transferred into a conical tube containing 3 mL of digestive solution of collagenase type 1 A 1 mg/mL plus type IV bovine pancreatic DNase 20 μg/mL in HBSS containing 5% FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin). The samples were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in a water bath shaker. The cells were collected once separated by a centrifuge for 10 min at 335 × g at 4 °C. The red cells were lysed by adding ACK lysing buffer for 1 min at room temperature.Flow cytometric analysisAs described [26], after unspecific staining was minimized through pre-incubation for 15 min with anti-mouse CD16/32, the BMDM were labeled with fluorescent primary or isotype antibodies. Fluorescent cells were analyzed after the exclusion of debris and aggregates with LSRFortessa (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Data were analyzed by FlowJo 7.6 (Tree Star Inc. Ashland, OR). All the experimental groups regarding flow cytometry and appropriate isotype controls were used to determine the gate selection. For simplicity, we did not show all the controls in the corresponding figures.Western blotting analysisAs previously described [11, 12], the cells were lysed in an ice-cold lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and a protease inhibitor cocktail (for cell signaling) as well as a phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Santa Cruz) for detecting phosphorylation. Protein concentrations were determined using a BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce). Denatured proteins (10–20 μg) were loaded and run on a 10% Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The proteins were then transferred to a PVDF membrane and incubated with primary antibodies. Membranes were exposed to corresponding HRP-labeled secondary antibodies and developed with an ECL kit (Amersham, Piscataway, NJ). Images taken were analyzed using Tanon Gel Image System 4200 (Shanghai Tanon Technology Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China).Quantitative real-time PCRThe total RNA from the lungs or cultured cells was homogenized and extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen, CA), as described by the manufacturer. The total RNA obtained was suspended in RNase-free water and stocked at −80 °C. Real-time PCR was performed on an ABI PRISM Step-One sequence-detection system (TIANGEN, Bejing) by using a SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Waltham, MA) after a reverse transcription reaction of 2 µg of RNA by using M-MLV reverse transcriptase (TIANGEN, Beijing). The relative expression levels of the corresponding genes were determined by the 2−ΔΔCT method [27], normalized by GAPDH. The mouse primer pairs were as follows:Arg 1 F 5′-AGACCACAGTCTGGCAGTTG-3′; R 5′-CCACCCAAATGACACATAGG-3′.Fizz1 F 5′‐TTTTGGGAGATCCAGAGTGG‐3′; R 5′‐CAAGAAGCAGGGTAAATGGG‐3′.Ym1 F 5′‐GACAGGCCAATAGAAGGGAGTTTCA‐3′; R 5′‐GACGGTTCTGAGGAGTAGAGACCAT‐3′.Chrna7 F 5′‐TGGAAACCAGACATTCTCCTC‐3′; R 5′‐AGGGAGATACTGGCAATGCC‐3′.Nos2 F 5′-GGTCTTTGACGCTCGGAACTGTAG-3′; R 5′-CACAACTGGGTGAACTCCAAGGTG-3′.Cxcl2 F 5′-GCTGTCAATGCCTGAAG-3′; R 5′-GGCGTCACACTCAAGCTCT-3′.Il6 F 5′-GGCCTTCCCTACTTCACAAG-3′; R 5′-ATTTCCACGATTTCCCAGAG-3′.Il10 F 5′-CCCTTTGCTATGGTGTCCTT-3′; R 5′-TGGTTTCTCTTCCCAAGACC-3′.Socs3 F 5′-CCTTCAGCTCCAAAAGCGAG-3′; R 5′-GCTCTCCTGCAGCTTGCG-3′.Foxo1a F 5′-CCCAGGCCGGAGTTTAACC-3′; R 5′-GTTGCTCATAAAGTCGGTGCT-3′.Gpadh F 5′‐AGCCCAGGATGCCCTTTAGT‐3′; R 5′‐GACATGCCGCCTGGAGAAAC‐3′.ChIP assayChromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was performed using a ChIP assay kit (Millipore, Billerica, MA) according to the manufacturer’s instruction, with minor modifications. Briefly, 5 × 106 BMDM cells were spread in a six-well cell culture cluster (Corning) and stimulated with and without GTS-21 (25 μM) and then challenged with either PBS or PR8 (2 MOI). After stimulation, the cells were cross-linked and then washed and resuspended in an SDS lysis buffer. Nuclei were fragmented by sonication and chromatin fractions were precleared with protein A-agarose beads followed by immunoprecipitation overnight with an anti-STAT6 Ab or a control IgG. Cross-linking was reversed and proteinase K digestion was performed. The input and immunoprecipitated DNA were amplified by real-time PCR. The ratio of the amount of DNA recovered relative to the input control was calculated. The primers for detecting Agr1 were as follows:Arg43–192 F 5′-GATGGGGAGGTTCTGTTGAC-3′, R 5′-GGGCTGTCCAGCTCCTCT-3′.Arg532–655 F 5′-CCTGACAACCCAAAGCAGTT-3′, R 5′-GGCACACGACAAAGACAACT-3′.Arg796–907 F 5′-AATCGAAACGGAGCAATGGG-3′, R 5′-GCCTCTCTCATCTGCCCTAG-3′.Knockdown of Foxo1a The oligos for shRNA- Foxo1a were as follows: forward 5′ CCGGAGCGTGCCCTACTTCAAGGATAACTCGAGTTATCCTTGAAGTAGGGCACGCTTTTTTG 3′ and reverse 5′ AATTCAAAAAAGCGTGCCCTACTTCAAGGATAACTCGAGTTATCCTTGAAGTAGGGCACGCT 3′, the sequence was used as [28]. The oligos were mixed with 10× NEB buffer 2, and annealed at 95 °C for 4 min and 70 °C for 10 min then slowly cooled to room temperature. The annealed oligos were cloned into lentiviral vector pLKO.1 (digested with AgeI and EcoRI). Two micrograms shRNA PLKO.1, 1.5 µg psPAX2, and 0.5 µg pMD2.G plasmids were co-transfected into 293T cells in one well of a six-well plate. The virus-containing medium was harvested at 48 h and added to the BMDM presented with polybrene (1 μg/mL). After incubation for 12 h, the virus-containing medium was removed. The cells were replaced in a fresh medium, cultured overnight, and then the treatment procedure listed in Fig. 4b was followed in both the experimental and control groups.Statistical analysisFor results regarding the qPCR, Western blot, and ChIP assay, the presentation in each figure is a representative result of two or three independent experiments. Statistics were calculated using SPSS software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) or GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). An unpaired t-test was used unless there were multiple comparisons, in which case we used one-way ANOVA with a post hoc Bonferroni test (with a significance level of P < 0.05). The results are shown as mean ± SD.ResultsVagotomy reduces lung anti-inflammatory responses during an influenza infectionWe collected lung and spleen cells from saline-treated sham and vagotomized mice and PR8-infected sham and vagotomized mice to detect IL-4 (an inducer of M2 MΦ activation for anti-inflammatory responses) expression by flow cytometry 6 dpi. We found that the IL-4 expression in PR8-infected sham lungs and spleens was increased as compared to that in the saline-treated mice; however, the expression was reduced in the lungs and spleens from PR8-infected vagotomized mice as compared to PR8-infected sham ones (Fig. 1a–d). Considering that ChAT (choline acetyltransferase) expressing CD4+ T [3] and α7nAChR-expressing CD11b+ cells [10] might contribute to the development of lung inflammation during influenza infection, we also analyzed these cells. Lung CD4+CHAT+ and α7nAChR+CD11b+ cells were increased in PR8-infected sham mice but did not differ between PR8-infected sham and PR8-infected vagotomized mice (Supplementary Fig. 1a, b). Blood Ly6hiCD206+ (CD206, another M2 MΦ marker) cells were increased in PR8-infected sham mice; however, these cells were reduced in PR8-infected vagotomized mice as compared to PR8-infected sham mice (Fig. 1e, f). Western blotting demonstrated that lung ARG1 (an important anti-inflammatory factor and M2 MΦ activation) expression was increased in PR8-infected mice as compared to saline-treated sham mice, but was reduced in PR8-infected vagotomized mice when compared with PR8-infected sham mice (Fig. 1g, h). These findings suggested that vagal circuits facilitate lung anti-inflammatory responses during an influenza infection.Fig. 1: Vagotomy reduces IL-4 production in influenza-infected lung and spleen, blood Ly6ChiCD206+ monocytes, and lung ARG1 expression.Saline-treated sham and vagotomized (VX), PR8-challenged sham and VX mice (i.n. 1.4 × 104 FFU/mouse) were sacrificed 6 dpi.

The body weight loss during 6 days post PR8 infection was greater in PR8-infected vagotomized mice than PR8-infected sham mice (Fig. 2a). Using the same mode, BAL was collected at 6 dpi. It was found that BAL protein levels and leukocyte counts were higher in PR8-infected vagotomized mice than PR8-infected sham mice at 6 dpi (Fig. 2b, c). Lungs were collected at 6 dpi to extract RNA for qPCR. The lung Cxcl2 and Il6 expressions were higher in PR8-infected vagotomized mice than PR8-infected sham mice (Fig. 2d, e). Lung cells were isolated for flow cytometry. Considering CCR2+ inflammatory cells can be recruited into the PR8-infected lungs in response to CXCL2, we analyzed CCR2+CD11b+ cells. We found that lung CCR2+CD11b+ cell levels were increased in PR8-infected vagotomized mice as compared to PR8-infected sham mice (Fig. 2f, g). Lung inflammatory MΦ (B220−CD11c+CD11b+) were increased in PR8-infected vagotomized mice as compared to PR8-infected sham mice at 6 dpi (Fig. 2h, i). These findings support the hypothesis that vagal circuits suppress lung inflammatory responses during an influenza infection.Fig. 2: Disruption of vagal circuits worsens influenza-induced lung inflammation.a The change of body weight loss in saline-treated sham and VX, PR8-challenged sham and VX mice.

We removed the lungs to measure Chrna7 and other anti-inflammatory (Arg1, Il10, and Socs3) genes by qPCR at 6 dpi. We found that lung Chrna7, Arg1, Il10, and Socs3 expressions were upregulated during the influenza infection; but these genes were reduced in PR8-infected Chrna7−/− mice as compared to PR8-infected Chrna7+/+ mice at 6 dpi (Fig. 3a–d). We isolated BAL cells for flow cytometry and found that BAL Ly6ChiCD206+ cells were increased in PR8-infected Chrna7+/+ mice; however, these cells were reduced in PR8-infected Chrna7−/− mice as compared to PR8-infected Chrna7+/+ mice at 6 dpi (Fig. 3e, f). These findings suggested that α7nAChR signaling favored M2 MΦ activation during an influenza infection. We intranasally challenged Chrna7+/+ recipients receiving Chrna7+/+ donor bone marrow and Chrna7+/+ recipients receiving Chrna7−/− donor bone marrow with PR8 (1.4 × 104 FFU/mouse). The mice were observed for 3 weeks and we found that PR8-infected Chrna7+/+ recipients receiving Chrna7−/− donor bone marrow had a reduced survival as compared to PR8-infected Chrna7+/+ recipients receiving Chrna7+/+ donor bone marrow (Fig. 3g), further supporting that α7nAChR expressed by bone marrow cells facilitates anti-inflammatory responses during an influenza infection.Fig. 3: Deletion of Chrna7 in bone marrow cells reduces lung anti-inflammatory responses.a–d Saline-treated Chrna7+/+, PR8-challenged Chrna7+/+ and Chrna7−/− mice (i.n. 1.4 × 104 FFU/mouse) were sacrificed 6 dpi.

Chrna7+/+ recipient mice were separately reconstituted with either Chrna7+/+ or Chrna7−/− donor bone marrow. The two groups of mice were challenged with PR8 (i.n. 1.4 × 104 FFU/mouse) and followed up for 21 days. The survival was analyzed by log rank test. n = 10 in each group, *P < 0.05.Full size imageActivation of α7nAChR increases IL-4-induced Arg1 expression but reduces Nos2 and TNF-α expression in PR8-infected BMDMWe developed BMDM using L929 cell-secreted M-CSF stimulation in the isolated bone marrow cells. By the flow cytometric analysis, we confirmed that BMDM were 96.6% F4/80+ cells (Fig. 4a). To test whether the activation of α7nAChR could regulate M2/M1 MΦ activation genes Arg1/Nos2 in PR8-infected MΦ, we pretreated the BMDM with eight different treating strategies (Fig. 4b). At 24 h, Arg1 expression was increased, however, Nos2 expression was reduced in the GTS-21 (α7nAChR agonist) treated PR8-infected IL-4-induced BMDM as compared to the PBS-treated PR8-infected IL-4-stimulated BMDM (Fig. 4c, d). TNF-α in the culture media, as an M1 phenotype signature molecule, was found to be reduced in the GTS-21 treated PR8-infected IL-4-induced BMDM as compared to the PBS-treated PR8-infected IL-4-stimulated BMDM (Fig. 4e). By Western blotting, we found that GTS-21 did not affect p-STAT6 levels in PR8-infected IL-4-stimulated BMDM, but significantly increased ARG1 expression at the protein level as compared to PBS-treated PR8-infected IL-4-stimulated BMDM (Fig. 4f). The other M2 MΦ activation markers, Fizz and Ym1, were also found to be increased in the GTS-21 treated PR8-infected IL-4-induced BMDM as compared to the other group (Fig. 4g). These findings suggest that activation of α7nAChR enhances M2 and suppresses M1 MΦ activation in PR8-infected IL-4-induced BMDM.Fig. 4: Activation of α7nAChR enhances M2 MΦ activation in IL-4-treated PR8-infected BMDM.a Histogram of F4/80 expression in BMDM.

Experiments were repeated 2 times. b The experimental conditions for inducing M2 MΦ activation. Eight treatment strategies were selected, while the 8th strategy was as follows: BMDM (5 × 105/well) received α7nAChR activation with GTS-21 (25 μM in PBS) for 30 min, IL-4 stimulation (10 ng/mL in PBS) for 6 h, and then PR8 (2 MOI in PBS) influenza challenge for 18 h. The other strategies were used as controls (the same concentration of cell, GTS-21, or IL-4 as the 8th was added as required).

We found that ARG1 expression in the GTS-21-treated (25 μM) PR8-infected IL-4-stimulated-Chrna7+/+ BMDM was increased as compared to the PBS-treated PR8-infected IL-4-stimulated-Chrna7+/+ BMDM. The ARG1 expression in the GTS-21-treated (25 μM) PR8-infected IL-4-stimulated-Chrna7−/− BMDM was lower than the ARG1 expression in the GTS-21-treated (25 μM) PR8-infected IL-4-stimulated-Chrna7+/+ BMDM (Fig. 5a), suggesting that GTS-21 could specifically act on α7nAChR. To test whether the activation of α7nAChR would affect p-AKT1, p-STAT6, and ARG1 levels in PR8-infected IL-4-stimulated BMDM in a dose-dependent way, we pretreated the BMDM with different doses of GTS-21 followed by PR8 challenge and IL-4 stimulation. The Western blot demonstrated that the activation of α7nAChR dose-dependently increased ARG1, but reduced phosphorylation of AKT1 in the PR8-infected IL-4-stimulated BMDM. The p-STAT6 expression did not change with the GTS-21 pretreatment (Fig. 5b). GTS-21 at 50 μM did not further increase the expression of ARG1 in PR8-infected IL-4-stimulated BMDM (Fig. 5b). We replaced PR8 with Poly I:C to observe the dose-dependent effects of GTS-21 on p-AKT1, p-STAT6, and ARG1 expression in IL-4-stimulated BMDM. We found that GTS-21 at 25 μM also reduced p-AKT1, increased ARG1, but did not change p-STAT6 in Poly I:C-challenged IL-4-stimulated BMDM as compared to PBS-treated Poly I:C-challenged IL-4-stimulated BMDM (Fig. 5c). GTS-21 at 50 μM did not further increase the expression of ARG1 in Poly I:C-infected IL-4-stimulated BMDM (Fig. 5c). To test the dose-dependent effects of IL-4 in triggering the expression of ARG1 in the GTS-21-treated PR8-infected BMDM, we used IL-4 (at concentration of 10, 25, and 50 ng/mL) to stimulate the GTS-21-treated PR8-infected BMDM. We found that IL-4 at a concentration of 10 ng/mL was the optimal concentration for inducing higher levels of ARG1 expression in the GTS-21-treated PR8-infected BMDM (Fig. 5d). IL-4 stimulation increased p-STAT6 expression, but this change was not in an IL-4-dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5d). To examine whether the activation of α7nAChR would increase STAT6 binding with the ARG1 promoter, we approached the ChIP assay and found that Arg1 relative expression (% input) was increased in the anti-STAT6 antibody (Ab) immunoprecipitated group as compared to the isotype Ab immunoprecipitated group in GTS-21-pretreated PR8-infected BMDM at 7 h (Fig. 5e), indicating that α7nAChR activation could enhance STAT6 binding with the ARG1 promoter in PR8-infected BMDM.Fig. 5: Activation of α7nAChR reduces AKT1 phosphorylation and increases p-STAT6 binding with ARG1 promoter.a Changes of ARG1, and p-STAT6 in GTS-21-PR8-IL-4 treated Chrna7+/+ or Chrna7−/− BMDM. The Chrna7+/+ or Chrna7−/− BMDM were treated according to the procedures listed in Fig. 4b. Two concentrations of GT-21 (25 and 50 μM) were used. b Using Western blot to detect dose-dependent effects of GTS-21 on ARG1, p-STAT6, and p-AKT1 in the GTS-21-PR8-IL-4 treated BMDM following procedure of Fig. 4b.

Experiments followed the procedures listed in Fig. 4b, but IL-4 concentration was chosen at 0, 10, 20, and 50 ng/mL. Data presented in Fig. 2a–d were repeated at least in two independent experiments. e Detecting STAT6 binding with Arg1 promoter by ChIP assay. The BMDM were treated GTS-21 (25 μM) for 30 min followed by PR8 (2 MOI) challenge for 6 h. The control groups received PBS. The data were pooled from three independent experiments, “-” condition indicated PBS treatment, **P < 0.01 in the indicated groups, unpaired t test.Full size imageActivation of α7nAChR promotes IL-4-induced ARG1 expression in PR8-infected BMDM by regulating JMJD3-H3K27me3 methylationSince H3K27me3 is a transcription repressor, we compared H3K27me3 expressions using strategies listed in Fig. 4b. By flow cytometric analysis, we found that H3K27me3 expression was lower in the GTS-21-treated PR8-infected IL-4 stimulated BMDM when compared with the PBS-treated PR8-infected IL-4 stimulated BMDM. The GTS-21 treatment also reduced H3K27me3 expression in PR8-infected BMDM as compared to PBS-treated PR8-infected BMDM (Fig. 6a). These findings suggested that the activation of α7nAChR mitigated the suppressive effects of H3K27me3 on transcription. Considering JMJD3 (coded by Kdm6b) is a key regulator of H3K27me3, we measured Kdm6b expression and found that Kdm6b was increased in the GTS-21-treated PR8-infected IL-4 stimulated BMDM when compared with the PBS-treated PR8-infected IL-4 stimulated BMDM (Fig. 6b). By Western blotting, we confirmed that the expression of p-AKT1 was reduced, JMJD3 was increased, and H3K27me3 was decreased in the GTS-21-treated PR8-infected IL-4 stimulated BMDM when compared with the PBS-treated PR8-infected IL-4 stimulated BMDM (Fig. 6c). We also found that the GTS-21 pretreatment particularly reduced H3K27me3 expression when BMDM were stimulated with an IL-4 no matter challenge with or without PR8 (Fig. 6d). The above results suggested that the activation of α7nAChR might reduce the phosphorylation of AKT1 and increased JMJD3 expression under IL-4 stimulation which modifies H3K27me3 methylation. To test whether JMJD3 would regulate ARG1 expression, we pretreated the GTS-21-treated PR8-infected IL-4 stimulated BMDM with JMJD3 inhibitor-GSK-J1 and found that the inhibition of JMJD3 reduced the ARG1 expression in the GTS-21-treated PR8-infected IL-4 stimulated BMDM as compared to the vehicle-pretreated GTS-21-treated PR8-infected IL-4 stimulated BMDM (Fig. 6e). We further studied whether the deletion of Akt1 would affect JMJD3 and ARG1 expressions and H3K27me3 methylation in GTS-21-treated PR8-infected IL-4 stimulated BMDM. By Western blotting, we found that JMJD3 expression was reduced, H3K27me3 methylation was elevated, and consequently ARG1 expression was reduced in the GTS-21-treated PR8-infected IL-4 stimulated LysMCre+Akt1fl/fl BMDM as compared to the GTS-21-treated PR8-infected IL-4 stimulated Akt1fl/fl BMDM (Fig. 6f). These findings indicated that the phosphorylation of AKT1 and AKT1 itself have deferential roles in regulating ARG1 expression in GTS-21-treated PR8-infected IL-4 stimulated BMDM.Fig. 6: Activation of α7nAChR increases IL-4-induced ARG1 expression depending on JMJD3-H3K27me3 methylation signaling.a Flow cytometric analysis of H3K27me3 expression in GTS-21-PR8-IL4-treated BMDM following the procedure in Fig. 4b.

The results in Fig. 6c–f were repeated in at least two independent experiments followed the experimental setting in Fig. 4b.Full size imageActivation of α7nAChR promotes IL-4-induced ARG1 expression in PR8-infected BMDM via suppressing phosphorylation of AKT1-FOXO1 signalingConsidering that the phosphorylation of FOXO1 by AKT1 could lead to exclusion of FOXO1 from the nucleus to cytoplasm [22], we first studied the corresponding changes of p-FOXO1, p-AKT1, and ARG1 expression in cell lysates by Western blotting. We found that p-FOXO1 and p-AKT1 were reduced, while in contrast, ARG1 was increased in the GTS-21 treated PR8-infected IL-4-stimulated BMDM as compared to the PBS-treated PR8-infected IL-4-stimulated BMDM (Fig. 7a). We then isolated the nucleus portion in the cultured cells to measure the ratio of FOXO1 to p-FOXO1. We found that ratio of FOXO1/p-FOXO1 in the nucleus was markedly increased in the GTS-21 treated PR8-infected IL-4-stimulated BMDM as compared to the PBS-treated PR8-infected IL-4-stimulated BMDM (Fig. 7b). Considering that FOXO1 is a positive regulator of M2 MΦ activation genes (Arg1, Fizz1, and IL-13ra1) [18], we built scrambled shRNA and Foxo1a shRNA constructs in Lentivirus. After the BMDM was infected with scrambled shRNA and Foxo1a shRNA Lentivirus constructs, we found that the knockdown of Foxo1a (Fig. 7c) markedly reduced Arg1 expression in the GTS-21 treated PR8-infected IL-4-stimulated BMDM as compared to the scrambled shRNA infected GTS-21 treated PR8-infected IL-4-stimulated BMDM (Fig. 7d). To test whether the deletion of Akt1 from BMDM would affect p-FOXO1 and ARG1 expression, we compared GTS-21-treated PR8-infected IL-4-stimulated Akt1fl/fl BMDM and LysMCre+Akt1fl/fl BMDM. We found that p-FOXO1 and ARG1 expression was reduced in the GTS-21 treated PR8-infected IL-4-stimulated LysMCre+Akt1fl/fl BMDM as compared to the GTS-21 treated PR8-infected IL-4-stimulated Akt1fl/fl BMDM (Fig. 7e). These findings also support the hypothesis that AKT1 existence is required for ARG1 expression in MΦ, and its role is different from the phosphorylation of AKT1.Fig. 7: Activation of α7nAChR augments IL-4-induced ARG1 expression relying on AKT1-FOXO1 signaling.a Effect of GTS-21 on FOXO1/p-FOXO1, AKT1/p-AKT1, and ARG1 in IL-4 stimulated PR8-infected BMDM.

The results were repeated at least two times.Full size imageIn summary, vagal circuit-α7nAChR signaling boosts lung anti-inflammatory responses and increases ARG1 expression during an influenza infection. In PR8-infected IL-4-stimulated MΦ, activation of α7nAChR could augment IL-4-induced ARG1 expression via STAT6, JMJD3-H3K27me3, and AKT1-FOXO1 signaling (Fig. 8).Fig. 8: Hypothetic model: activation of α7nAChR boosts ARG1 expression in the influenza-infected macrophages.When vagus nerve is intact, acetylcholine release is normal. Influenza infection can increase lung α7nAChR, CHAT, and IL-4 expression, which facilitates the development of anti-inflammatory responses. Activation of α7nAChR could increase STAT6 binding with ARG1 promoter. In PR8-infected IL-4-stimulated MΦ, activation of α7nAChR can reduce phosphorylation of AKT1 and exclusion of FOXO1 from nucleus, and increase JMJD3 expression by which suppressing H3K27me3 methylation. These changes augment ARG1 expression in M2 macrophages. In contrast, vagotomy compromises acetylcholine release and expression of IL-4 during influenza infection. The reduction of activation of α7nAChR and IL-4 mitigates STAT6 binding with ARG1 promoter, promotes exclusion of FOXO1 from nucleus, and increases H3K27me3 methylation. These changes impair lung anti-inflammatory responses and ARG1 expression.Full size imageDiscussionIn this study, we have found that the disruption of vagal circuits could reduce lung and spleen IL-4 expression during an influenza infection. ARG1, an M2 MΦ activation marker, was reduced in PR8-infected vagotomized mice. BAL protein and leukocytes and lung M1 MΦ activation genes (Cxcl2 and Il6) were increased in PR8-infected vagotomized mice. In PR8-α7nAChR-deficient mice, lung M2 MΦ activation genes: Arg1, Il10, and Socs3 and BAL Ly6C+CD206+ cells were reduced. The PR8-infected bone marrow α7nAChR−/− mice had a lower survival. In the in vitro study, activation of α7nAChR could enhance IL-4-induced Arg1 expression and reduce Nos2 and TNF-α expression in PR8-infected MΦ. Mechanistically, activation of α7nAChR boosted IL-4 induced ARG1 expression in the PR8-infected MΦ via STAT6, JMJD3-H3K27me3, and AKT1-FOXO1 signaling.The pulmonary parasympathetic inflammatory reflex has afferent and efferent arcs, which could modulate lung infection and immunity [9, 10, 29, 30] as the distal airways and alveoli are innervated by vagus nerve endings [7]. A study has shown that peritoneal ACh levels were reduced at days 1, 3, and 7 post vagotomy and that this change altered resting peritoneal lipid mediator profiles and increased peritoneal leukocyte recruitment [31]. Previously, we measured AChE activity in alveolar proinflammatory cells and BAL choline concentrations in E. coli pneumonia and found that the AChE activity and choline levels in the BAL cells were increased [12]. The ACh concentration, however, did not increase in the BAL in E. coli pneumonia, which is consistent with the rapid hydrolysis of ACh (half-life, 2 min) occurring after ACh release from nerve endings [32]. During an influenza infection, the ChAT-expressing immune cells, especially the CD4+ T cells, might synthesize acetylcholine [3, 33]. We found that CD4+ChAT+ cells were increased in PR8-infected sham mice, but did not differ between PR8-infected sham and vagotomized mice. This finding indicated that CD4+CHAT+ cells might contribute to ACh production in PR8-infected sham mice’s lungs. Thus, we speculate that the disruption of vagal circuits might reduce lung ACh, which impairs the activation of α7nAChR expressed by the adjacent MΦ. As reported, the resident MΦ and recruited monocytic cells expressed α7nAChR in the lung [10,11,12]. The α7nAChR+CD11b+ cells were increased in PR8-infected lungs but did not differ between PR8-infected sham and vagotomized mouse lungs. The finding also suggested that the reduced activation of α7nAChR resulting from vagotomy might compromise M2 MΦ activation. More importantly, lung IL-4 expression was significantly reduced in the PR8-infected vagotomized lungs versus in the PR8-infected sham lungs. This change might majorly account for the reduced M2 MΦ activation under vagotomy conditions.M2 MΦ activation can express a variety of signature genes, such as Arg1, Fizz, Ym1, and Il10. In this study, we aimed to study whether and how the activation of α7nAChR would affect M2 MΦ activation. We knew that it is impossible to examine all the signature gene changes; we simply selected ARG1 as our target. It is reported that IL-4 stimulation could alter arginine metabolism by inducing ARG1 expression and inhibiting nitric oxide production in MΦ. The induction of Arg1 transcription by IL-4 stimulation requires a composite DNA response element for STAT6 [34]. In our study, the ChIP assay demonstrated that the activation of α7nAChR by GTS-21 could increase STAT6 binding with the ARG1 promoter in PR8-infected BMDM, which provides a molecular basis for synergizing with IL-4 stimulation to boost M2 activation in MΦ under an influenza challenge.The PI3K/AKT pathway is an important signaling pathway that regulates inflammation. PI3K plays a key role in phosphorylating AKT1, and the latter can then affect alternative MΦ activation [35, 36]. In LPS-stimulated MΦ, AKT1 ablation gives rise to an M1 and AKT2 ablation results in an M2 phenotype [37]. In this study, we found that the activation of α7nAChR reduced p-AKT1S473 and upregulated the IL-4-induced ARG1 in PR8-stimulated MΦ. However, in PR8-infected LysMCre+Akt1fl/fl BMDM, GTS-21 pretreated IL-4 induced ARG1 expression was suppressed. Therefore, we speculate that AKT1 itself and phosphorylation of AKT1S473 might regulate ARG1 expression in IL-4 induced PR8-infected BMDM differently.In the GTS-21-treated PR8-infected IL-4-induced BMDM, the activation of α7nAChR reduces p-AKT1. Lower p-AKT1 coincided with higher JMJD3 expression at both mRNA and protein levels. Meanwhile, the GTS-21-treated PR8-infected IL-4-induced BMDM had a reduced H3K27me3 expression as compared to the PBS-treated PR8-infected IL-4-stimulated BMDM. It is reported that IL-4 treatment of human monocytes could increase the transcription of Kdm6b [38]. Thus, the reduction of p-AKT1 and IL-4 stimulation might cooperatively boost Kdm6b expression in the GTS-21-treated PR8-infected IL-4-induced BMDM. Furthermore, the activation of α7nAChR could reduce p-AKT1 and p-FOXO1, which retains FOXO1 in the nucleus to enhance IL-4-induced Arg1 transcription [18, 39]. The knockdown of Foxo1a could abolish the upregulated Arg1 transcription in GTS-21-treated PR8-infected IL-4-induced BMDM, suggesting that FOXO1 is a key regulator in boosting Arg1 transcription in GTS-21-treated PR8-infected IL-4-induced BMDM. There is an evidence showing that FOXO1 overexpression promotes H3 acetylation and phosphorylation, and reduces H3 methylation [40]. Therefore, α7nAChR boosting Arg1 transcription in PR8-infected IL-4-induced BMDM might allow for synergism between JMJD3-H3K27me3 and FOXO1 signaling.Different from the effect of the reduction of phosphorylation of AKT1 on ARG1 transcription, the knockout of AKT1 reduces Arg1 transcription in GTS-21-treated PR8-infected IL-4-induced BMDM by suppressing JMJD3 expression and increasing H3K27me3 expression. Thus, we consider that AKT1 itself is a positive regulator of ARG1 expression in monocytic cells during influenza-induced lung inflammation. It needs to be noted that we cannot exclude the other AKT isoforms play a role in mediating Arg1 expression, for example, AKT2 could also regulate pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis via modulating macrophage activation [41].A study has demonstrated that GTS-21 has cell-specific anti-inflammatory effects, which are independent of α7nAChR [42]. In the present study, GTS-21 could not boost ARG1 expression in PR8-infected IL-4-induced BMDM from Chrna7−/− macrophages. Our result indicates that GTS-21 specifically acts on α7nAChR. To exclude the role of α7nAChR in the other type of cells, we approached the bone marrow transplantation mouse model to figure out the role of α7nAChR in bone marrow cells in regulating influenza-induced lung inflammation. As shown in Fig. 3g, we have demonstrated that wild-type mice receiving Chrna7−/− bone marrow-derived cells had higher mortality, supporting the hypothesis that activation of α7nAChR in bone marrow cells might favor M2 MΦ activation and dampen M1 type proinflammatory responses in lung inflammation due to an influenza infection. One study has shown that α7nAChR knockout mice had more body weight loss than wild-type mice after cigarette smoke exposure and H9N2 infection [13], which supports our findings from an inflammatory point of view.Meanwhile, we have extensively studied whether activation of α7nAChR would affect virus replication in the influenza-infected lungs. We found that activation of α7nAChR could promote influenza replication in the lung epithelial cells. Mice with vagotomy or knockout of α7nAChR had lower viral titers in influenza-infected lungs. We have also elucidated the possible mechanisms by which activation of α7nAChR promotes influenza replication in lung epithelial cells (unpublished data). The findings in Fig. 3g supported that α7nAChR expressed by bone marrow-derived cells (rather than lung epithelial cells) contributes to reduction of influenza lung inflammation.Many experiments have demonstrated stimulation of vagus nerve could suppress inflammatory responses via activation of α7nAChR in macrophages [3, 5, 30]. Activation of α7nAChR in macrophages inhibits LPS or Poly I:C induced NF-κB activation or triggers similar anti-inflammatory responses. It is reported that in LPS-challenged microglia, activation of α7nAChR inhibits the transformation of M1 microglia and promotes the M2 phenotype [14]. TLR3 agonist Poly I:C also induced M2 macrophage activation [43]. In our study, we found that Poly I:C did not increase ARG1 expression; however, activation of α7nAChR could significantly increase IL-4-triggered ARG1 expression (Fig. 5c) in Poly I:C-challenged macrophages. Therefore, vagotomy or knockout of α7nAChR could mitigate LPS or Poly I:C induced M2 macrophage activation.In summary, vagal-α7nAChR signaling is required for lung anti-inflammatory responses during an influenza infection. The activation of α7nAChR boosts IL-4-induced ARG1 expression in MΦ via STAT6, JMJD3-H3K27me3 methylation, and AKT1-FOXO1 signaling.

The virus would spread around the world, the first global outbreak since the 1918 flu pandemic and the first test of a fledgling early warning system. More than one million people died, 116,000 of them in the United States. But schooling, shopping, and sporting events went on as normal, and the pandemic has largely faded from public memory.

By Jen Pinkowski January 07, 2021 On April 17, 1957, the first news of a flu outbreak in Hong Kong reached an American audience, when a single column of news appeared in the New York Times on the international page. Amidst dispatches from Turkey, the UK, Greece, and Sweden, and ads for men’s tropical worsted suits and women’s silk blouses, was the headline “Hong Kong Battling Influenza Epidemic.” Thousands of people were lining up for treatment at clinics across the British colony, many of them “refugees from Communist China.” Mothers carried their “glassy-eyed” children on their backs. Some 250,000 people were sick—about 10% of Hong Kong’s population. Officials worried that overcrowded conditions among the city’s 700,000 refugees would lead to calamity. Epidemiologists around the world looked at Hong Kong with a sense of dread. The outbreak had happened unnervingly fast, indicating that this flu virus was unusually infectious. And while there had been small regional outbreaks of flu since the 1918 pandemic that killed perhaps 40 million people worldwide, no single pathogen had swept the world. From our vantage point in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, the response to the 1957 flu is illuminating of the critical turning points that determine how a disease spreads and how it ultimately impacts society. It forced officials to make hard decisions balancing public health and potential disruption to daily life. It was the first test of a new early warning system for global outbreaks, and the first pandemic that was battled in real time with a newly developed vaccine. The seeds of that response were planted during World War II, when the U.S. military formed a Commission on Influenzae, recruiting leading researchers from universities and hospitals. Out of that effort came the first flu vaccine, developed by Thomas Francis and Jonas Salk (Salk famously went on to develop the polio vaccine in 1952). Soldiers got the first flu shots. In 1948, the World Health Organization established the Worldwide Influenza Centre in London at the National Institute for Medical Research—where the flu virus was first identified, in 1933—and four years later launched the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS), a network of 26 laboratories around the world tasked with monitoring flu evolution. And just a year before the outbreak, in 1956, the Influenza Branch of the CDC, which was only about a decade old, became a WHO Collaborating Centre for Surveillance, Epidemiology & Control of Influenza. These systems weren’t really challenged until the flu pandemic of 1957. Experts saw the pandemic coming, and attempted to mobilize in response. But while the skeletal framework for coordinated action may have been in place, it lacked connective tissue. Samples sent from Hong Kong to the WHO in London, for example, weren’t immediately analyzed, frustrating the researchers who’d sent them. The 1957 pandemic has largely faded from public memory. One reason may be that while many died, its mortality rate was low. It’s classified as a Category 2 pandemic—one step more severe than the seasonal flu and swine flu. (The 1918 pandemic is a Category 5. Based on its mortality rate so far, COVID-19 would be a Category 3 or 4.) Another reason that the pandemic is forgotten may be that it struck a society more accustomed to contagious disease than we are; antibiotics and vaccines were only beginning to become more widely available as tools of public health. Moreover, even as millions became ill and thousands died, travel, school, shopping and sporting events mostly went on as normal. Sick Sailors In spring 1957, as the novel H2N2 virus spread through eastern Asia, American sailors in the Pacific began to get sick. The virus spread through the close quarters of ships and then military bases in Japan and Korea. Doctors had sailors gargle with a throat-wash and took samples of their blood, some of which they bottled and sent to the U.S. One of those who requested viral samples was Maurice Hilleman, the chief of respiratory diseases at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Washington, D.C. Hilleman would go on to invent more than 40 vaccines over the course of his career. While researchers were relieved to realize that they weren’t facing the same strain as the one that caused the 1918 pandemic, they were also alarmed that they had a novel strain on their hands. Hilleman ignored federal regulations and called six vaccine manufacturers directly, advising them, “Don’t kill your roosters.” Vaccines were produced in fertilized eggs; with millions of doses to be developed, they were going to need a lot of eggs. He shipped viral samples to all six so they could get started. They promised to provide 60 million doses by February 1, 1958. He also issued a press release from Walter Reed, warning that a flu pandemic would hit in the fall just as the new school year started. But the flu didn’t wait for fall. By June, it had spread to 20 countries, including the U.S., where it landed on military bases first. An aircraft vessel parked at a port in southern California saw 157 crew admitted to sick bay in just two weeks. And at a naval base in San Diego, 70% of the recruits got sick. Soon there were 10,000 cases on West Coast bases alone. Across the country, at a port in Rhode Island, the flu swept through the quarters of seven destroyers. Summer Superspreaders In early June, hundreds of teenage girls attended a Girls State government event at the campus of the University of California, Davis. Soon enough, more than 200 of them began to shiver and burn in their dorm rooms. “The girls feel rough for about a day as their temperatures go up to 103 and 104 but after that they snap right out of it,” the Girls State program director told a local paper. The young attendees were fine—but a 57-year-old advisor died. One of the girls didn’t show any flu symptoms until she was on a train to Iowa with about a hundred other Californians. They were headed to an international church conference at a college in Ames with about 1,700 participants. The group was split up and housed all over campus, and soon other conference attendees fell ill. So many people were infected that the organizers cancelled the conference and sent everyone home—where they subsequently passed on the virus to others. By mid-July, the virus’s spread in the U.S. was pretty well known by both the public and by health authorities. The CDC had created an Influenza Surveillance Unit in response, and were receiving weekly health reports from counties across the country. It also conducted a weekly national health phone survey of 2,000 persons in 700 households. Cases of people who’d spent at least a day in bed with an upper respiratory infection were flagged and sent to the CDC. Both methods documented that a pandemic was indeed underway. Dozens of kids from California fell ill on a train to the Boy Scouts Jamboree, but weren’t turned back. Multiple clusters of cases would eventually be traced to the event. And yet in mid July, nearly a thousand kids from California packed onto a weeklong cross-country train to Valley Forge, Pennsylvania. They were headed to the fourth annual Boy Scouts Jamboree, where 52,580 kids from 43 countries were going to bunk for a week in hundreds of tents sprawled across the Revolutionary War battlefield. Vice President Richard Nixon would greet them when they arrived, and musician Jimmy Dean—better known today for his breakfast sausages—would entertain them with his band, the Harmonica Rascals. On the train, dozens of scouts came down with body aches, sore throats, fevers, and fatigue. Troop leaders alerted the event organizers. But instead of turning the kids back, the organizers decided to let them stay, segregating the boys in an isolated area of the park. The CDC and Pennsylvania public health officials also set up an infirmary tent for suspected flu cases. Amazingly, there wasn’t a massive outbreak at the jamboree, but enough boys got infected that they became disease vectors when they returned to their hometowns. Multiple clusters of cases would eventually be traced back to the event, including a flu outbreak resulting from the 18 scouts who brought the virus back to Jackson, Mississippi. Similar scenes repeated throughout the summer. One outbreak in northeast Louisiana came as schools opened in July to make up for lost classroom time in the spring, when the students harvested strawberries. Cases exploded by early August, forcing 10 schools to shut down. Nevertheless, the disease spread across Louisiana and into Mississippi. And yet the 1957 outbreak hadn’t proved to be particularly fatal. “Most of the deaths have occurred among persons already weakened by chronic disease, old age, or hunger,” the United Press reported in late June. “The great majority of patients recover after three or four days of fever and malaise.” “The probability of another 1918 is slight,” Carl Bauer, an influenza expert with the U.S. Public Health Service, told the UP, “but we cannot assume it is an impossibility.” A Voluntary Allocation Plan Even as cases ebbed in mid August, public health officials worried whether the big hit would come in September, as Hilleman had predicted, or early winter, as was typical. Anticipating the former scenario, the CDC had done intensive contract tracing in Louisiana to understand how the pandemic might play out as kids returned to school. The surgeon general, Leroy Burney, directed that vaccine doses should be allotted to states based on population size. Soon after, public health experts from the USPHS came together in Washington, D.C., to figure out how to get the vaccine out. They developed a “voluntary allocation” plan with vaccine manufacturers that would distribute the shots through the free market. There would be no central federal management. In theory, it was to be an equitable distribution. But as historian George Dehner writes in Influenza: A Century of Science and Public Health Response, pharmaceutical companies had already taken vaccine preorders from corporate clients such as Ford and AT&T. One pharma executive said the companies “would need to be considered in any allocation plan.” The military had claimed the first 2.6 million doses; sailors and soldiers began to receive inoculations in August. Vulnerable populations, healthcare workers, and essential transportation, communications, and utility employees were next on the list; they needed 12 million doses. Officials launched a promotional campaign to encourage all Americans to get the vaccine once it became more widely available. Sidelining Football Season When schools opened in early September, flu cases exploded across the country. Schools were often the source. Kids were more susceptible than adults to H2N2; unlike COVID, the virus was less likely to infect people over age 60. Student absentee rates ranged from 30 to 60% in many communities. In New York City, tens of thousands of kids were out sick at once. But schools remained open. A health commissioner in Nassau County, New York, explained the rationale: “Children would get sick just as easily out of school.” Adults missed work at a much lower rate, but some stayed home. In hard-hit New York City, the subway system lost $1 million in revenue as sick riders skipped the commute. Large corporations secured many of the early doses of the vaccine. By the time it was widely available, infection rates were dropping and as much as half of the vaccine was returned unused. By late September, few vaccine doses were available compared to the size of the outbreak. The American Medical Association charged that doses were going to corporate executives rather than doctors’ patients. There were reports that football players for the San Francisco 49ers got shots but cops and firefighters didn’t. According to Dehner, a pharma sales manager summed up the problem this way: “You got 25 people wanting apples and you only got one apple. So who gets the apple? The guy who has his hand out first.” Public health officials monitored the outbreak but believed that “efforts to contain it were futile,” scholars at the Center for Biosecurity of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center wrote in a 2009 paper. Rather than quarantining the infected, cancelling large events, or limiting travel, they stressed keeping the sick at home. Sick people inundated clinics, doctors’ offices and emergency rooms, but few of them needed to be hospitalized. So normal life continued—and people got ill. By October, more than half of the counties in the U.S. had an outbreak. College football games across the country—Western Michigan vs. Colorado State, Lehigh vs. Rutgers, Navy vs. Yale, and many others—were cancelled because too many players were sick. The cancellations coincided with the pandemic’s peak. That’s also when vaccines started to become more broadly available. But they were less than 60% effective, and they took two weeks to have a protective effect. Moreover, skeptics claimed the vaccine was worse than the disease, and some critics said the government’s vaccine promotion was a scheme to increase sales, Dehner writes. In November, infection rates began to drop all over the country. By then, 53 million vaccine doses had been released, but the demand was low. Vaccine manufacturers sold some of it overseas, but as much as half of it was eventually returned to them, unused, according to Hillman. At sea, it was a different story. The Pacific ships that had been struck down in the summer suffered another round of infection in November, even though their crews had been vaccinated. Sailors on two naval vessels became ill after visiting ports in Japan, which was having a major outbreak. Two more ships were stricken after visiting ports in the Philippines. Back in the U.S., the worst of the pandemic was over. But Christmas spending was muted. A nationwide poll found that nearly half of people said they had less money because of the pandemic. Mysterious Deaths in Winter ’58 Infection rates remained low throughout the winter of 1958, and yet death rates increased, puzzling public health officials. The CDC’s chief epidemiologist suspected it was the result of small, sporadic outbreaks that flew under the radar. By spring, the pandemic was largely over. It’s not quite accurate to say that life returned to normal in 1958, because life had remained mostly normal. The death rate had been low, many of the cases had been mild, and there had been virtually no restrictions on daily life. As a Pomona county health officer put it in February 1958, “The approach of the influenza pandemic across the Pacific was so well heralded that the first wave of the disorder was something of an anticlimax for many people—especially for those who missed getting it.” And yet, H2N2 caused about 1.1 million deaths around the world in 1957–58. As many as 116,000 of them occurred in the U.S. In 1958, Met Life statisticians calculated that it had lowered the average life expectancy in the U.S. by 3.6 months, from an all-time high of 70.2 to 69.9. Though the vaccine came too late to have much of an impact on the 1957 pandemic, its relatively fast development set a new bar—one that would be surpassed in 1968, which saw another flu pandemic that began in Hong Kong. That vaccine was ready in 66 days. Looking for more insights? Sign up to get our top stories by email.

The outbreak, which occurred in the Thies region east of the capital Dakar, has killed 58,000 birds in the 100,000-strong flock, with the remaining animals culled, the OIE said, citing a report from Senegal’s veterinary services. H5N1 – a type of influenza virus – causes a highly infectious, severe respiratory disease in birds called avian influenza (or “bird flu”). Humans can occasionally contract H5N1 avian influenza but transmission from an infected person to another is difficult. When people do become infected, the mortality rate is about 60 percent, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Infection in people is mostly associated with close contact with infected live or dead birds, or H5N1-contaminated environments. So far, there is no evidence that the disease can be spread to people through properly prepared and thoroughly cooked food.

The $500 Hands and Feet Grant will provide 50 doses of influenza vaccine to the Health Partners Free Clinic in Troy, Ohio. Cedarville students will administer the vaccine free of charge.“Being able to serve our community as health care providers is what we are passionate about,” said Corri Adams of Akron, Ohio, a second-year professional pharmacy student and president-elect of Cedarville’s CPFI chapter. “This year has shown us new ways in which we can provide services to the people around us.”“This year has shown us new ways in which we can provide services to the people around us.”- Corri AdamsDr. Justin Coby, a preceptor for Cedarville pharmacy students at the free clinic, shared with students his hope to provide free flu shots for the local community. After hearing this, Erin Ballentine, a third-year professional pharmacy student and president of Cedarville’s CPFI chapter from Walkersville, Maryland, presented the need to Cedarville’s CPFI executive board, and together they put together an application for the CPFI Hands and Feet Grant.“I was glad we were able to serve the Health Partners Free Clinic in this way because of how their staff has poured into our learning as student pharmacists,” explained Ballentine. “I believe what made our report stand out the most was how we expressed the need we saw in the community and how we would be able to administer these vaccines and serve these people in such a tangible way.”Last year, students received a similar Hands and Feet Grant that provided blood glucose and blood pressure monitoring devices to the Springfield Soup Kitchen in Springfield, Ohio. Cedarville students would conduct screenings when serving at the kitchen, but without Cedarville students present, there was no way for community members to monitor their own health. Because of last year’s grant, people are able to check their blood glucose and blood pressure whenever the soup kitchen is open.“I am inspired by this chapter’s efforts to regularly and selflessly find ways to help the less fortunate in our corner of Ohio,” said Dr. Jeffrey Bates, CPFI chapter advisor, associate dean of the school of pharmacy and associate professor of pharmacy practice. “Cedarville’s efforts to write these grants was well thought out and closely matched the criteria of CPFI. The students did a terrific job of matching needs with the granting organization's wishes. I'm so proud of their efforts!”Located in southwest Ohio, Cedarville University is an accredited, Christ-centered, Baptist institution with an enrollment of 4,550 undergraduate, graduate, and online students in more than 150 areas of study. Cedarville is the seventh-largest of 68 private universities in Ohio.

Spriggs, M.D., MPH, FACP — Written by Nancy Lovering on January 7, 2021Flu susceptibility Flu and psoriasis symptomsFlu shotTakeawayOverviewPsoriatic arthritis (PsA) is an inflammatory type of arthritis that causes stiffness, swelling, and joint pain. It often accompanies the skin condition psoriasis, although not everyone with psoriasis will develop PsA. It’s an autoimmune disease, which means the body’s immune system attacks its own healthy cells.The cause of PsA isn’t clear, but genetics and your environment are thought to be contributing factors. If you have a family history of PsA, symptoms can develop from exposure to triggers like physical trauma or infection.Influenza (flu) is a virus that leads to respiratory infection. It affects your nose, throat, and lungs. The illness commonly called “stomach flu” is gastroenteritis, which isn’t the same as influenza.Symptoms of influenza include fever, aching muscles, cough, and fatigue. Unlike the common cold, the flu has a sudden onset and usually includes a fever. It often resolves on its own, but some people are at higher risk for complications, some of which can be serious.Why are people with psoriatic arthritis more susceptible to flu?Since autoimmune diseases like PsA involve your immune system attacking healthy cells, treatment often involves decreasing that extra immune system activity. Medications that suppress your immune system can also make you more vulnerable to infections like the flu.Can flu make psoriasis worse?Infections trigger an inflammation response. That means that if you have inflammatory arthritis like PsA, a virus like the flu can trigger a flare.If you’re taking immune-suppressing medications like biologics, you may have to discontinue their use while you have the flu so you’re better able to fight the infection. Going off of your treatment may worsen your PsA symptoms.If you have PsA and you contract the flu, you’re also more likely to require hospitalization because of complications. These include:flu-related pneumoniarespiratory infectionsstrokeheart attackIt’s important to take action to avoid the flu. Taking these precautions can help you stay healthy each flu season:Get a flu vaccine.Avoid contact with people who have the flu.Wash your hands regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.Avoid touching your face.Disinfect high-touch surfaces like door handles and TV remotes.Ask your doctor about protective medication additions or changes.Get regular exercise.Eat a healthy diet.Take supplements that boost immunity, like vitamin D. Always check with your doctor before adding supplements to make sure they don’t interfere with your medication.Make sure you get enough sleep each night.Practice stress management.Flu shot and psoriatic arthritisThere are two types of flu vaccine: an injectable and a nasal spray. Only the injectable flu vaccine is safe for people diagnosed with PsA. It’s an inactivated vaccine, meaning it doesn’t contain any live virus material. It won’t cause the virus against which it protects, so it won’t trigger an arthritis flare or bring on flu symptoms. Here’s what you should know about the two vaccine types:Injectable vaccine. The injectable flu vaccine contains purified influenza antigen from viral material that’s been grown in a lab and then killed. The antigen part of a virus is what triggers your immune system to respond and make protective antibodies against the virus. The injectable vaccine won’t give you the flu because the viral material used to make the antigens is no longer alive.Nasal spray vaccine. The nasal spray flu vaccine is a live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV), which means it uses live, but weakened virus material. This type of vaccine isn’t recommended for anyone who has an altered immune system. If you have PsA, you should take the injectable flu vaccine, not the nasal spray version.Flu vaccine side effects are usually mild. They include:soreness, redness, or inflammation at the injection sitelow grade fevermuscle achesheadacheAlthough the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends getting your flu shot before the end of October each year, you can still benefit from a later vaccination. It takes about 2 weeks from your vaccination date to develop enough flu antibodies from the vaccine to protect you. This protection lasts about 6 months, although it declines as time passes.Certain drugs and higher doses of steroids may interfere with vaccine effectiveness. You may benefit from a temporary doctor-supervised break from your medication while the flu vaccine takes effect.Even when vaccinated, people diagnosed with PsA should continue to take additional flu prevention measures such as handwashing and improved nutrition.The takeawayPeople diagnosed with PsA are more likely to catch the flu and experience worsened flu symptoms, especially if they’re being treated with immunosuppressive medications. Some PsA medications can interfere with the flu vaccine and make it less effective. Ask your doctor about the medications you take, and if you should take a temporary medication holiday when you get vaccinated. The injectable version of the flu vaccine is safe for those who have an autoimmune disease like PsA because it contains non-live material. If you have PsA, you shouldn’t get the nasal spray flu vaccine, which has live but weakened viral material.There are other steps you can take to stay well during flu season, including washing your hands, eating well, getting enough sleep, and avoiding contact with germs.How we reviewed this article:SourcesHistoryHealthline has strict sourcing guidelines and relies on peer-reviewed studies, academic research institutions, and medical journals and associations.

France is to cull around 600,000 poultry birds as it tries to contain an avian influenza virus that is spreading among duck flocks in the southwest of the country, the farm ministry said on Tuesday. France is among European countries to have reported highly contagious strains of bird flu late last year, leading to mass culls as authorities try to limit transmission from wild birds to farm flocks. France has already slaughtered around 200,000 poultry and plans to cull a further 400,000 birds, a farm ministry official said. The culls include flocks where outbreaks occurred, as well as preventive slaughtering of birds in surrounding areas. As of Jan. 1, France had confirmed 61 outbreaks of the H5N8 virus, of which 48 were in the southwestern Landes region, the farm ministry said in an earlier website update. The Landes is part of a duck breeding zone that supplies the foie gras industry. In other regions, the spread of the virus appeared to be under control, the ministry added. The H5N8 strain of bird flu is not known, so far, to be transmissible to humans. With information from Reuters Categories: Agriculture, Health & Science, International. Tags: avian influenza, France.

The Avian influenza, commonly known as bird flu, is killing thousands of crows, ducks, poultry and herons across the country. On Jan. 5, more than 1800 migratory birds, mainly bar-headed geese, found dead in a lake sanctuary in the northern Indian state of Himachal Pradesh in December tested positive for the bird flu. The death toll at this lake, a common site for migratory birds during the winter season, is now 2400. Videos by VICE Read Next Bird Flu Is Forcing Egg Prices to Skyrocket Bird flu is a highly infectious and severe respiratory disease that occurs in birds. It is caused by the H5N1 influenza virus. There are at least 861 known cases of human infection between 2003 and 2019, but the World Health Organisation maintains that human-to-human transmission remains rare. Its symptoms are similar to COVID-19 and include cough, fever, sore throat, muscle aches, shortness of breath and headache. Experts conclude that if an infected chicken or egg is cooked properly, there is low risk of transmission to humans. In the northern Indian state of Rajasthan, hundreds of crows began dropping dead from Dec. 25 onwards. The panic around these dead birds prompted forest officials to test their samples, only to confirm the re-emergence of the avian influenza. Peacocks, pigeons and poultry birds across the state also succumbed to bird flu. Read Next Thousands of Dead Birds Are Dropping Out of the Sky and Nobody’s Sure Why In the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh, the bird flu virus was confirmed after testing the samples of 50 crows found dead in the last week of December in the city of Indore. The state’s animal husbandry department has called for strict surveillance within the 1 km area. Meanwhile, two districts in the southern Indian state of Kerala were put on high alert after bird flu killed more than 12,000 ducks. Officials have sounded a statewide alert, and announced that more than 35,000 birds in the state would be culled to keep the H5N8 virus in check. In the northern Indian state of Haryana, 150,000 chickens across various poultry farms died mysteriously, and authorities have now sent their samples to get tested. India’s most severe outbreak of the bird flu was in 2008, when millions of poultry were culled to contain the virus. In November last year, Belgium and the U.K. reported bird flu outbreaks at a poultry farm and turkey farm respectively. In December 2020, a Japanese poultry farm first reported cases of the bird flu, prompting authorities to cull 134,000 chickens across various farms. Follow Shamani on Instagram and Twitter.

The Conversation — CNN Many of us have heard: “Don’t go outside without a coat; you’ll catch a cold.” That’s not exactly true. As with many things, the reality is more complicated. Here’s the distinction: Being cold isn’t why you get a cold. But it is true that cold weather makes it easier to get the cold or flu. It is still too early to tell how weather impacts the Covid-19 virus, but scientists are starting to think it behaves differently than cold and flu viruses. As an associate professor of nursing with a background in public health, I’m asked about this all the time. So here’s a look at what actually happens. Many viruses, including rhinovirus – the usual culprit in the common cold – and influenza, remain infectious longer and replicate faster in colder temperatures. That’s why these viruses spread more easily in winter. Wearing a heavy coat won’t necessarily make a difference. READ MORE: Why you can’t get the flu from a flu shot Virus transmission is easier when it’s cold More specifically, cold weather can change the outer membrane of the influenza virus; it makes the membrane more solid and rubbery. Scientists believe that the rubbery coating makes person-to-person transmission of the virus easier. It’s not just cold winter air that causes a problem. Air that is dry in addition to cold has been linked to flu outbreaks. A National Institutes of Health study suggests that dry winter air further helps the influenza virus to remain infectious longer. How your immune system responds during cold weather also matters a great deal. Inhaling cold air may adversely affect the immune response in your respiratory tract, which makes it easier for viruses to take hold. That’s why wearing a scarf over your nose and mouth may help. READ MORE: Can you die from a common cold? Also, most people get less sunlight in the winter. That is a problem because the sun is a major source of vitamin D, which is essential for immune system health. Physical activity, another factor, also tends to drop during the winter. People are three times more likely to delay exercise in snowy or icy conditions. Instead, people spend more time indoors. That usually means more close contact with others, which leads to disease spread. Respiratory viruses generally spread within a 6-foot radius of an infected person. When you are indoors, it is very likely that you are closer together than 6 feet. In addition, cold weather dries out your eyes and the mucous membranes in your nose and throat. Because viruses that cause colds and flu are typically inhaled, the virus can attach more easily to these impaired, dried-out passages. READ MORE: Diving into cold water can be deadly – here’s how to survive it What you can do While the bottom line is that being wet and cold doesn’t make you sick, there are strategies to help prevent illness all year long. Wash your hands often. Avoid touching your face, something people do between nine and 23 times an hour. Stay hydrated; eight glasses a day of water is a good goal, but that could be more or less depending on lifestyle and the size of the person. Eat a well-balanced diet. Dark green, leafy vegetables are rich in immune system-supporting vitamins; eggs, fortified milk, salmon and tuna have vitamin D. Stay physically active, even during the winter. Clean the hard, high-touch surfaces in your home often. If your nose or throat gets dry in the winter, consider using a humidifier. Get the flu vaccine. And one more important thing this year: When it’s your turn, make sure you get the Covid-19 vaccine. READ MORE: Where do those snowfall totals on the news come from?

(Nitin Sharma/BCCL Chandigarh)The culling of tens of thousands of poultry birds has begun in India following confirmed reports of avian influenza—popularly referred to as the bird flu—from 12 epicentres in four states of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, and Kerala. The dreaded infection has been confirmed in crows in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, in migratory bird species in Himachal Pradesh, and in poultry and ducks in Kerala.Meanwhile, with more reports of mysterious bird deaths emerging from several other states, panic appears to be brewing across India, where people are still in the midst of battling the COVID-19 pandemic. To ensure proper and complete protection from this disease, understanding it in-and-out is key. Here’s our attempt to help you with that by answering some frequently asked questions about bird flu:What is bird flu?Bird flu or avian influenza is a highly contagious viral infection among birds, although it is also capable of infecting humans and other animals. It is caused by Influenza Type A viruses, which generally affect poultry birds like chickens and turkeys. Wild aquatic birds like ducks and geese are the natural reservoirs of influenza A, and they play a central role in the viruses’ ecology. As is the case with the coronavirus, the Influenza A virus also has many strains. While some are mild and merely cause a low egg production in birds, others can cause severe infections and end up being deadly for the winged wanderers. Many birds are known to carry the virus within their systems without developing sickness and shed it through their droppings. In some cases, the virus tends to jump from these birds and their waste over to mammals like pigs, horses, cats, and dogs.These viruses are usually transported across long distances by migratory waterbirds—in fact, the migratory birds that enter India during the winter months are said to be the primary culprits behind smuggling the disease into the country this time too. How does bird flu infect humans?Although there are several types of bird flu, the H5N1 strain of influenza is its most common form. Back in 1997, the H5N1 became the first avian influenza virus to infect humans in Hong Kong, and that outbreak was linked to handling infected poultry.Essentially, the disease is transmitted to humans when they come in contact with infected birds’ faeces, nasal secretions, or secretions from the mouth or eyes. Even touching contaminated surfaces can spread the disease. Birds infected with H5N1 continue to release the virus through faeces and saliva for as long as 10 days. At present, there is no significant evidence of the bird flu spreading via human-to-human contact. So far, almost all cases of bird flu infection in humans have been traced back to close contact with infected birds or contaminated environments. However, there does exist the risk of the virus mutating—perhaps by altering its shape to allow itself to grab on to human cells more effectively—and becoming easily transmissible from person to person, which could potentially cause another epidemic. In fact, influenza viruses are known to undergo constant genetic changes, and this has been a cause of concern for health experts.Can eating poultry and eggs cause bird flu?AdvertisementContrary to popular misconceptions, consuming poultry or eggs from infected birds does not transmit the bird flu—but only as long as they are properly cooked and the eggs aren’t served runny. Bird meat is also considered safe if it has been cooked to an internal temperature of 73.9ºC. The virus is sensitive to heat and dies in cooking temperatures.Apart from consuming undercooked food, avoiding open-air markets and close contact with infected birds are the other two ways to prevent yourself from getting infected. A large number of human infections till date have been linked to home slaughter and handling of the dead birds. Therefore, the World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends avoiding such high-risk practices, while encouraging hygienic handling and proper cooking of poultry meat and products.What are the symptoms of bird flu?The symptoms of bird flu in humans are similar to typical flu-like symptoms, which include:CoughDiarrhoeaRespiratory difficultiesFever HeadacheMuscle achesMalaise (feeling of illness and weakness)Runny noseSore throatChest painAccording to the WHO, the incubation period—the time from the moment of exposure to the virus, until the disease symptoms appear—for bird flu in humans averages from 2 to 5 days, and ranges up to 17 days.It is important to note that if you have been exposed to bird flu, or are experiencing its symptoms, you should notify the doctor’s office or the hospital prior to your visit. Alerting them in advance will allow them to take precautions to protect their staff and other patients while caring for you.How lethal is bird flu? Can it be treated?While contracting bird flu is fairly rare among humans, it can be deadly once the infection does occur. As per the WHO, the H5N1 has killed nearly 60 per cent of those it has infected. However, the actual mortality rate may be lower due to possible under-reporting of asymptomatic cases.As for treatment, the Union Health Ministry recommends antiviral drugs, especially oseltamivir (Tamiflu), to improve the prospects of survival in humans. In most cases, the flu develops into a serious disease and needs hospitalisation and intensive care. Therefore, the ministry has urged people working with poultry to use PPEs and follow hand hygiene as preventive measures. Candidate vaccines to prevent H5N1 infection have also been developed, but they are not ready for widespread use yet.**For weather, science, and COVID-19 updates on the go, download The Weather Channel App (on Android and iOS store).

Currently, the pressures to accelerate the development of COVID-19 vaccines have raised concerns about adequate safety and effectiveness testing, but also highlighted perceptions of the vaccines as “experimental.” 1 In a recent survey, half of the respondents preferred to delay vaccination, whereas 20% claimed that they would refuse altogether to vaccinate either themselves or their children against COVID 19. 2 These results suggest a low vaccination acceptability status-quo, impeding an adequate vaccination rate required for achieving herd immunity against this virus when the vaccine become available. Meanwhile, the dominant messages, such as stay-at-home and shelter-in-place to help curb the spread of COVID-19, have led to a notable decrease in immunization services uptake. For example, childhood immunization rates have dropped by 73% since the beginning of the pandemic.3 Now, as social distancing requirements are gradually relaxed, the US could experience outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases if routine vaccinations are not re-initiated. Shifting the minds of those hesitant to get vaccinated is challenging. It requires in-depth knowledge of the target population and long-term investment in multifaceted interventions. To understand vaccination decision-making behaviors, The WHO recommends using the “COMâ€‘B model” (Capability, Opportunity, Motivation—Behavior).4 According to this model, vaccine decision-making is influenced by personal-level factors (capability and motivation), and environmental-level factors (opportunity). In the dearth of robust evidence to guide COVID19 vaccine interventions, the “COMâ€‘B model” can be used to generate ideas as to where research should be directed. Future research should aim to better disseminate knowledge on the benefits of vaccines in order to enhance individuals’ capabilities. First, routine vaccines from influenza to measles provide partial protection against COVID-19, suggesting the significance of maintaining routine immunization during the pandemic to benefit from their spillover effect.5 Second, a growing body of evidence shows that COVID-19 pathogenesis expands beyond the lungs to impact the cardiovascular system; more than three-quarters of surviving COVID-19 patients suffered from heart muscle complications.6 Informing the public that vaccine efficacy is not limited to preventing infection but can also mitigate the severity of the disease is essential. It is also crucial to revise the lessons learned from the success of earlier immunization programs to motivate people to get vaccinated. For example, during the influenza pandemic in 20009, the H1N1 vaccine demonstrated high effectiveness and safety despite the widespread skeptical perceptions, at the time, due to its relatively rapid development. 7 Additionally, reassuring those who may be hesitant to go for vaccination visits about the safety of the vaccine delivery systems might improve access to immunization services. Finally, vaccinating is a prosocial act. In other words, people get vaccinated to benefit others rather than themselves. It, therefore, seems valuable to assess the interplay between the vaccination decision factors and the inclination for prosocial vaccination. The success of any vaccination program depends on the proportion of the population that gets vaccinated. Unless social and behavioral researchers develop and evaluate interventions supporting vaccine decision-making soon, subsequent vaccination campaigns will be insufficient to achieve adequate vaccine coverage, which is necessary to curtail the infection and to allow a return to routine social activities.

Moreover, most current methods ignore or under-utilize human processing capabilities that allow humans to solve problems not yet solvable by computers (human computation). We demonstrate how behavioral research, linking digital and real-world behavior, along with human computation, can be utilized to improve the performance of studies using digital data streams. This study looks at the use of search data to track prevalence of Influenza-Like Illness (ILI). We build a behavioral model of flu search based on survey data linked to users’ online browsing data. We then utilize human computation for classifying search strings. Leveraging these resources, we construct a tracking model of ILI prevalence that outperforms strong historical benchmarks using only a limited stream of search data and lends itself to tracking ILI in smaller geographic units. While this paper only addresses searches related to ILI, the method we describe has potential for tracking a broad set of phenomena in near real-time.

Mining search and social media data for real-time tracking (i.e., “nowcasting”) of flu prevalence and other events has become a major focus in public health, computer science, and other disciplines1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10. One highly cited example of using search query data to forecast illness is Google Flu Trends (GFT). Many efforts have built upon the early work of GFT, which provided a promising real-time influenza tracking system, based on the idea that searches for the flu will increase when users are ill. While GFT showed the value of using digital streams like search data to forecast important events, it ultimately faced considerable challenges1,11,12. We pick up on two major issues identified by prior research12, and present methods, relying on standard techniques, to address them.The central premise underlying the GFT methodology—and one which still underlies many efforts of its kind today—was to use the massive amount of search queries produced by users to find a few that are the best at predicting (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) CDC flu rates. The first issue researchers pointed out was that GFT was a problematic marriage of big and small data, since the algorithm involved over 50 million search terms narrowed down to predict a little over 1000 CDC data points12. This methodology doomed GFT to sweep up some false positive search terms that happened to peak at the right time and place. Rooting out false positive predictors in such a massive predictor space is a central concern in the use of search data and other big data streams, but, as a consequence, the GFT model missed its CDC target for long stretches of time12. Later work corrected some of the errors of the GFT approach, by incorporating reports from CDC as the season progresses, adjusting for changes in search behavior, and leveraging the properties of time-series, to vastly improve the reliability of the forecast9. But the central approach—mapping a huge number of search queries to a short series of CDC data—remains largely the same.The second major issue identified by prior researchers was measurement of flu-like illness itself. For systems like GFT, search query data are the primary instrument for measuring influenza-like illness (ILI) in the population. However, it is not yet clear that search query data are even a good indicator for ILI symptoms12. Sparse empirical evidence currently exists to support (or reject) the idea that users experiencing ILI symptoms make more searches for the flu. To generate such evidence, one would need access to a user’s online searches and information about any illness symptoms they are currently experiencing. Such data would allow researchers to observe whether the presence of illness symptoms associated with the flu leads to an increased propensity to search for flu-related information. However, even with high-quality observational data from a user’s online searches and reported symptoms, more information is needed. The prior distribution of search propensity is unlikely to be uniform across all demographic groups, and is likely to be correlated with ILI prevalence within groups. In addition, users experiencing ILI symptoms may make searches to find diagnostic information, but only if they cannot access that information through other means.In an effort to address these two primary areas of concern, we describe an approach to flu tracking that uses standard social-scientific methods to build a behavioral model of the relationship between Internet search and flu-like illness. Our approach captures user search data combined with survey data of flu-like symptoms to give us a granular view of the measurement properties of search data. The behavioral model based on these data demonstrates the underlying measurement value of using search data as a surrogate for flu-like symptom reports at the household level. We enlist trained coders to remove false positive predictors of flu-like experience that are otherwise challenging to do algorithmically. We leverage our behavioral model to create a weighted forecast of ILI in the US population. We find that this survey-driven approach enables us to define the demographic differences in search, detect relevant flu searches in a more systematic fashion, and adjust for demographic variance in flu search behavior when building a forecasting model. This method could be useful in tracking various other phenomena for which survey data might provide an empirical link between large-scale digital sources (such as queries or social media posts) and localegional outcomes (such as ILI, unemployment rates, or movie ticket sales).In comparison to existing approaches, our model can track ILI prevalence in subregional populations up to 2 weeks in advance of CDC flu reports. To demonstrate the practical application of our model to a digital search stream, we compare its performance against strong baseline models, including a highly accurate auto-regressive LASSO model of the historical signal9. There is a long history of epidemiological models that estimate rates of transmission through populations using a mix of network data, social media data, and clinical data1,2,4,5,6,8,9,13,14. Statistical models use sample data to infer population-level rates of ILI, while mechanistic models describe whole populations to simulate ILI spreading and infer rates of ILI infection13. Both types of modeling approaches estimate rates of ILI in different populations in order to generate advanced warnings of season start time, peaks, or duration, often to substitute for costly and time-consuming clinical measures (like the CDC flu reports). However, common metrics for model evaluation remain a topic of some debate13. We focus here on applying our survey results to build a tracking model that uses search queries effectively to track ILI prevalence.ResultsBehavioral and tracking modelsOur approach is to directly measure how ILI symptoms affect searches associated with the flu. To do so, we tracked the online behavior of a set of users for an entire flu season, and identified user searches and online behaviors pertaining to ILI diagnostic information. We will discuss two models: a behavioral model based on a case–control design that maps Internet search behavior to ILI symptoms, and a tracking model that maps behavioral signals from search queries to generate predictions of flu prevalence. The behavioral model relies on a survey in concert with browser tracking to tabulate whether users had ILI symptoms during the flu season. Then, we build a flu tracking model drawing on insights from the behavioral model. We tested the flu tracking model using data from national and state-level CDC reports.Survey and browsing dataWe partnered with a survey vendor maintaining a nationally representative panel of approximately 20,000 individuals with personal computers (Supplementary Methods 1.3.1 and Supplementary Table 1). Respondents in the panel had consented to participate in marketing research in return for monetary compensation; researchers were able to track their web browsing, their search activities, and send questionnaire invites. All survey and panel data were anonymous and purged of any personally identifiable information before they were received for analysis.Since users who conduct a higher volume of searches are more likely to generate a flu-related search by chance, we selected subsets of the ongoing panel to participate in flu forecasting research. We sent survey invites to two subsets of participants (N = 1180 and N = 4000) from the full 20,000 person panel. One set of participants met the following criteria: (1) they had executed queries in any search engine (including Bing, Google, Yahoo), (2) they had used flu-related keywords (e.g., “flu,” “fever,” “influenza,” “swollen,” “cough,” “pneumonia,” “sore throat”), or they had visited flu-related URLs (e.g., WebMD, CDC, Wikipedia). The second group was a comparison group that did not execute a flu-related query or visit a flu-related web site. We used a case–control approach to select the comparison group, drawing randomly from the panel within bins based on search volume. We did this to maintain balance on search volume since people with flagged searches had higher than average search volumes (Supplementary Methods 1.3.1 and Supplementary Table 3).From these individuals, we collected survey responses for a total of 654 individuals (13% response rate), broadly similar to the invitees, of which 10 did not have any reported search volume in the sample period. This left us with 262 who had searched a flu-related keyword or site and 382 who did not (omitting 10 who had no reported search; Supplementary Methods 1.3.3 and Supplementary Table 1).The panel provided access to the entire browsing history of respondents, allowing us to examine web page visits and search queries simultaneously. Incorporating information about flu-related web visits, in addition to queries, allowed us a more complete picture of user behavior in the presence of flu-like symptoms. Table 1 shows means and standard deviations of the main survey variables of interest. Volume refers to the logged number of searches by a respondent, and ILI is defined as when respondents report both fever and cough for themselves or family members.Table 1 Descriptive statistics of survey data.Full size tableWe fielded our flu survey in the spring of 2015. Our survey questionnaire asked respondents for demographic, household, and flu-related information. We asked respondents about all symptoms of ILI since November 2014, followed by a question in which we asked which month these were experienced. We also asked these questions about children and other adults in the household (including spouses). We followed up by asking which sources (Supplementary Methods 1.3.3), if any, these individuals used when seeking information about these symptoms and health care provider diagnoses, if relevant.Identifying flu-related searchesA central question surrounding the use of query/social media data for flu prediction is how to identify a flu-related query, post, or web page. The traditional approach used by GFT and others is to narrow down searches based on their observed association with flu prevalence, but this method produces a large number of false positives. Instead, we identified flu-related search queries with the aid of trained human coders. This method allowed us to select search queries with a high prior likelihood of being associated with the flu and to exclude closely related yet irrelevant queries. For example, using this method we were able to identify and remove searches associated with news and current events unlikely to reflect underlying symptoms of users, such as “Obama sore throat,” which with other methods may be misleadingly associated with flu prevalence.Broadly, flu-related search activity can be defined as when search text contains key words and cues likely to be relevant to a person experiencing symptoms and/or seeking diagnosis information. These may include simple searches for flu-like symptoms—including fever, cough, sore throat, and other canonical symptoms—as well as more specific searches, such as “what are the symptoms of the flu?”, or “continued fever is a symptom of...” We considered such queries to be highly relevant to user experience and labeled such queries as A1 type searches. Other types of queries related to research or news-related queries (such as “Spanish flu”), we labeled as A2. We also labeled other types of queries, such as those associated with secondary symptoms of ILI, non-ILI illnesses, and other categories (see Supplementary Methods 1.5.2).To identify A1 (flu-related) searches and browsing behavior from respondent data, we asked trained human coders to label each search query and web page visited by respondents in a multi-step process (Supplementary Methods 1.5.4). We found 21% of respondents made an A1 query or page visit, and 14% made an A2 query or page visit. With these labels in hand, we modeled the relationship between reported flu-like symptoms and online activity.Behavioral model of searchWe identified respondents as having ILI symptoms if they reported having both fever and cough at some point during the flu season. The presence of ILI symptoms for the respondent or in the household served as our key explanatory variable linking ILI symptoms to A1 search behavior (our key outcome variable). However, in estimating our model we also included an array of demographic characteristics of the respondents to adjust for variation across demographic groups and for heterogeneous effects of ILI symptoms on search behavior.To infer the effect of the combination of symptoms on flu-like search activity, we used a classic (or cumulative) case–control design to estimate the relative risk of A1 search when flu symptoms are reported15. To do so, we paired respondents who made A1 searches (positive cases) with others who did not (negative cases), and estimated the effects of ILI symptoms and demographic variables. Because A1 queries are a relatively small share of all searches made online, we adjusted our estimates for differences between the base rate of flu-like search in our sample and our best estimate of the rate of flu-like search in the population. We used the average flu-like search rate in the Bing search engine to make this adjustment (Supplementary Methods 1.6.1).Based on this model, we calculated the relative risk (RR) and risk difference (RD) of A1 search activity given ILI symptoms: RR = Pr(Y = 1∣X1, τ)/Pr(Y = 1∣X0, τ), RD = Pr(Y = 1∣X1, τ) − Pr(Y = 1∣X0, τ)15, where τ is the incidence of A1 searches, X1 is a k-vector of covariates of a treatment group with flu symptoms and X0 indicates a k-vector of covariates of a control group lacking flu symptoms. Covariates included search volume, gender, parenthood status, and age (Supplementary Methods 1.3.2 and Supplementary Table 5). To control for the fact that the population’s rate of flu-like (A1) search differed from our sample, we substituted the constant term in the logistic model for a corrected term that matched the observed rate of flu search in the Bing search engine. This corrected term is calculated as: \({B}_{0}-ln[\left(\frac{1-\tau }{\tau }\right)\left(\frac{\bar{y}}{1-\bar{y}}\right)]\), where B0 is the original constant term, τ is the rate of A1 search in the population (1.2e-5), and \(\bar{y}\) is the rate of A1 search in the sample. The coefficients remain unbiased.MRP smoothing and re-weightingWe construct smoothed and re-weighted estimates of A1 searches by day and by state using multilevel regression with post-stratification (MRP). MRP is a method for making predictions with non-representative and/or non-probability survey data16, typically at the sub-national level. This is useful for practitioners because it allows for modeling a wider array of data than models that require nationally representative data. To apply this approach, we first assign binary A1 labels to a large corpus of Bing search queries. This comprises our response variable. Next, we estimate the proportion of A1 search queries in state s within a moving time window, producing a prediction for the final day of the moving window. We re-weight each state-day prediction based on the number of zipcodes in each state belonging to each cell (stratum)(Supplementary Methods 1.8:2). MRP effectively splits the data into cells that represent unique combinations of characteristics. For example, we would identify a cell for zip codes in Minnesota with a high number of college graduates if we grouped the data by state and education.With a relatively small sample of users, we do not observe all possible word combinations of flu-like searches. This is problematic for forecasting, because we may miss many positive indicators of flu-like experience. In order to capture a wider array of potentially flu-related queries, we used our labeled sample of queries from the respondent panel and applied an embedding method called DOC2VEC17. The DOC2VEC method creates document representations based on word embeddings learned from a corpus of text. These word embeddings capture deeper co-occurrence relations that allow us to retrieve similar documents. In our case, this method located other queries that are semantically related to labeled A1 queries but were not in our browser dataset. We then tasked human coders with applying the same A1 labeling scheme we described earlier to the new and expanded set of A1 candidate queries from DOC2VEC.The MRP method leverages information from similar cells—those possessing one or more similar characteristics—to reduce variance where Internet search might be rare. This reduces the amount of error for sparse cells and is useful for datasets with sparse coverage for certain population subgroups. It re-weights estimates based on census benchmarks for the geography where one desires to make a prediction. We acquired census data from the American Community Survey 2014 5-year estimates (Supplementary Information 1.7.2). We created 3131 cells based on combinations of state, proportion of children per household (binned by quartile), proportion possessing a college education (binned by quartile), and age in each zipcode (for more information on how the variables were constructed, see the Supplementary Information 1.7.2). We deploy the following MRP model over each window of time to smooth and re-weight search queries collected at the zip code level:$$Pr({y}_{it}=1)= \,{{\rm{logit}}}^{-1}\left({\beta }_{0}+{\beta }_{[it]}^{{\rm{Income}}}+{\alpha }_{j[it]}^{{\rm{State}}}+{\alpha }_{j[it]}^{{\rm{Education}}} \right.\\ + \,\left.{\alpha }_{j[it]}^{{\rm{Age}}}+{\alpha }_{j[it]}^{{\rm{Child}}-{\rm{per}}-{\rm{House}}}+{\alpha }_{j[it]}^{{\rm{Education}}* {\rm{Age}}}\right)$$ (1) Here, the subscript j[i] refers to the cell (j) and the window (t) to which the ith query belongs. The response variable yit indicates whether the ith query in that window is labeled A1. We applied the MRP model over a rolling 3-day window of all search queries possessing a flu-related term, making a prediction for the final day of the window (Supplementary Information 1.7.2)18. We then re-weighted to state- and national-level census benchmarks using the formula in (\({\hat{y}}_{s}^{PS}\)) below (PS = post-stratified)19.The term \({\beta }_{[it]}^{{\rm{Income}}}\) is a fixed coefficient on income at the zipcode level, as the inclusion of predictive geographic covariates often improves the performance of MRP models20. The terms \({\alpha }_{j[i]}^{{\rm{State}}}\), \({\alpha }_{j[i]}^{{\rm{Education}}}\), \({\alpha }_{j[i]}^{{\rm{Age}}}\), etc. represent varying coefficients associated with each categorical variable. Effects are assumed to be drawn from a normal distribution and estimated variance. For example, for states it is assumed that \({\alpha }_{j}^{{\rm{State}}} \sim N(0,{\sigma }_{{\rm{State}}}^{2})\).To create state-level estimates, we re-weighted each estimate based on the number of cells of each type in each state, following19:$${\hat{{y}_{s}}}^{PS}=\frac{{\sum }_{j\in {J}_{s}}{N}_{j}{\hat{y}}_{j}}{{\sum }_{j\in {J}_{s}}{N}_{j}}$$ (2) Once we obtained smoothed daily state-level estimates of A1 searches, we then trained different time-series models on state- and national-level CDC data for the ILI rate between 2012 and 2016, using the MRP estimates as an exogenous signal. We also trained comparison models using an unprocessed A1 exogenous term and others using historical data alone.Time-series forecasting modelsWe evaluate the merits of the re-weighted MRP search signals by employing them as inputs in forecasting models. Our goal is not to demonstrate any new time-series algorithm but to demonstrate that already effective forecasting models can get a meaningful performance boost by using the MRP signal.As demonstrated by Lazer et al.12, ILI rates have a strong historical and seasonal dependence, and a model trained purely on history can be a strong predictor of future influenza rates. So we considered, based on the current literature, different models that incorporate the relevant exogenous signals derived from our survey and compared the results to these models based only on the historical ILI signal9. This included both the popular Lasso-based9 as well as the SARIMA-based methods. Let YILI(t) be the time series of weekly influenza rates for a geographic entity (US or State), \({X}_{j}^{{\rm{A1}}}(t)\) be the time series of logit transformed volumes of A1 labeled search queries and finally Xmrp(t) be the exogenous weekly time series corresponding to the MRP signal aggregated at the national level (see Table 2). We also assumed that \(\epsilon (t) \sim {\mathcal{N}}(0,{\sigma }^{2})\).Table 2 National ILI accuracy (horizon = 1 week) scores based on percent CDC ILI visits.Full size tableThe following models were then considered$${\rm{SARIMA}}-{\rm{HIST}}:{\phi }_{p}(B){\Phi }_{P}({B}^{s}){Y}^{{\rm{ILI}}}(t)={\theta }_{q}(B){\Theta }_{Q}({B}^{s})\epsilon (t)$$ (3) $${\rm{SARIMA}}-{\rm{MRP}}:{\phi }_{p}(B){\Phi }_{P}({B}^{s}){Y}^{{\rm{ILI}}}(t)={\theta }_{q}(B){\Theta }_{Q}({B}^{s})\epsilon (t) +{\phi }_{1}{X}_{{\rm{mrp}}}(t)$$ (4) $${\rm{SARIMA}}-{\rm{A1}}:{\phi }_{p}(B){\Phi }_{P}({B}^{s}){Y}^{{\rm{ILI}}}(t)={\theta }_{q}(B){\Theta }_{Q}({B}^{s})\epsilon (t) \\ +{\phi }_{1}\sum_{j = 1}^{m}\frac{{X}_{j}^{{\rm{A1}}}(t)}{m}$$ (5) $${\rm{LASSO}}-{\rm{HIST}}:{Y}^{{\rm{ILI}}}(t)=\sum_{i = 1}^{p}{\theta }_{i}{Y}^{{\rm{ILI}}}(t-i)+\epsilon (t)$$ (6) $${\rm{LASSO}}-{\rm{A1}}:{Y}^{{\rm{ILI}}}(t)=\sum_{i = 1}^{p}{\theta }_{i}{Y}^{{\rm{ILI}}}(t-i)+\mathop{\sum }\limits_{j = 1}^{m}{\phi }_{j}{X}_{j}^{{\rm{A1}}}(t)+\epsilon (t)$$ (7) for the seasonal ARIMA model with exogenous variables (SARIMA-MRP/SARIMA-A1) or without (SARIMA-HIST) the notation refers to a ARIMA(p, d, q) × (P, D, Q)s model in the Box–Jenkins terminology21. The LASSO-A1/LASSO-HIST models were estimated using a Lasso penalty. ARGO8,9 is an example in the context of ILI prediction.For SARIMA-based models we chose the appropriate orders (p, P, q, Q) for the model using AIC as a criterion. We set p = 52 in the LASSO-based models to account for the seasonal effect in ILI rates, but, since we were using the Lasso penalty, the coefficients of most of these lags did not appear in the final model. This approach also served to select the appropriate lag in modeling ILI rates. Finally, we provided predictions for the 2015–2017 seasons by using a rolling 3-year period to train and predict.To examine how well our model performed at finer spatial granularity than the national level, we collected flu data on the number of positive influenza swabs from the states of DE, DC, NM, and NY (see figures in Supplementary Methods 1.7.4 and Supplementary Fig. 8). These states were selected because they (1) collect and publicly post current flu prevalence rates on their official health pages and (2) make historical flu prevalence data available for long enough time spans to be useful for prediction. However, unlike the CDC data these states do not provide a total number of hospital visits as the denominator to the ILI rate. Instead, we trained our model using the raw counts of the ILI positive cases reported in the state. These state-level search signals will be especially noisy due to lower search volumes than the national level.We used a rolling 3-year period to train and test our models. We trained using the MRP smoothed-reweighted signal (SARIMA-MRP), and made comparisons against a history-only model (SARIMA-HIST) and an averaged simple unweighted (non-MRP) A1 series (SARIMA-A1)(see Table 3). All of these models are exceptionally strong, as they all use out-of-sample performance to parameterize the number of lags to include. To compare the different methods we used RMSE as a metric after selecting the model parameters based on the AIC (Akaike Information Criterion). We tested the performance of our model on rolling 1- and 2-week ahead forecasts using exogenous signal at the most predictive lag.Table 3 State-level tracking model RMSE (h = 1 week/h = 2 weeks).Full size tableKey survey findingsBefore discussing how online searches were associated with reported symptoms, it is worth noting that we found differences in the relative rate at which respondents said they sought information from healthcare providers versus online sources. Fully 33% of respondents said that they searched for information online about symptoms they had experienced but did not consult a health provider. 26% consulted the Internet and a health provider, and only 6% reported seeking information from a health provider and did not consult the Internet, 28% did neither of these things and the remainder refused to answer (Supplementary Methods 1.4).We observed a heightened tendency to search for flu (A1) when there was an occurrence of flu symptoms in the household. Fig. 1 plots the expected values of Y, Pr(Y = 1∣X, τ), where household flu is present and absent. In Fig. 1, the means of = Pr(Y = 1∣x1, τ) and Pr(Y = 1∣x0, τ) are shown with dark vertical lines. The estimated risk ratio (RR) is 1.57 (95% CI = 1.05, 2.34), meaning that those with flu symptoms execute almost 60% more A1 searches compared to those exhibiting no symptoms at all. Since the base rate of query activity in the population is relatively low, this amounted to a risk difference (RD) of about 5.41e-06 (95% CI = 5.57e-07, 1.09e-05). In other words, we found the presence of flu-like symptoms increased the relative rate of flu-like search queries (A1) by more than half, but when calculated as a change in the proportion of all searches, the difference is small. This finding underscores why using individual-level data to build a behavioral model is important, detecting such minor changes using query data alone would be quite challenging. We generally did not find symptoms to positively affect A2 search queries (Supplementary Information 6.1).Fig. 1: Estimated search rates by flu presence.Estimated population-level search rates. Based on survey data in the presence of reported household flu (in light yellow) and absence of reported household flu (in dark grey). The x-axis indicates a proportion of searches and the y-axis indicates the estimated density of searches where household flu = 0, 1.Full size imageSearches were noisy indicators for particular subgroups, specifically heavy searchers, women, and mothers. We found that A1 searches were correlated with higher search volumes generally, suggesting that individuals who search for a lot of information online make flu-related searches even in the absence of symptoms. A person in the third quartile of search volume was about 30% more likely to search for the flu (RR=1.32, 95% CI = 1.04, 1.68) in comparison to someone with the first quartile search volume, with a risk difference of RD = 3.09e-06 (95 CI = 4.62e-07, 6.10e-06)(See Supplementary Information Table 13).Fathers and mothers had dramatically different behaviors in reaction to perceived child illness. We found fathers to be much more likely to make flu searches when their children were ill with ILI symptoms, whereas mothers tended to have a high baseline tendency to make such searches regardless of child illness. Fathers made more than 8 times as many A1 searches when their children exhibited ILI symptoms compared to when they were symptom-free (RR = 8.75, 95% CI = 2.21, 42.36), which amounted to a risk difference of RD=1.95e-05 (95% CI = 5.16-06, 4.53e-05).We found A1 search rates were not highly distinct across respondent race and education. Differences between self-identified racial categories were not significant. This included individuals self-identifying as White, Black, Asian, Native, or Hispanic. Similarly, education was not a strong differentiator of A1 search among respondents. Individuals who reported having completed high school were not more or less likely to make flu searches compared to individuals who reported completing some college, a bachelor’s degree, or a graduate degree.Tracking model performanceTable 2 shows that the MRP signal improves upon the 1-week ahead MAPE (mean average percent error), RMSE (root mean squared error), and MAE (mean absolute error) compared to the history-based models (for a total period of T = 123 weeks) (all metrics look at the average deviations of model predictions, see Supplementary Information 6.8 for mathematical definitions of these metrics). As such, estimates in 2016/2017 deviated by 12.29/13.74% from the true values in these tests. For reference to a more common metric, the MRP tracking estimate correlates at 0.90/0.84 with the national ILI rate in the 2016/2017 season. Fig. 2a shows that the absolute error for the MRP signal has a lower mean and variance than other history or A1-based models. On average, the SARIMA-MRP model showed fewer outliers and a smaller median error compared to the pure history model. We conjecture that since Bing is only a portion of all search queries, our models would perform better with more search data. Additionally, if we look at h = 2-week ahead predictions (the prediction at step t + h, given the CDC data point at step t and the exogenous signal at step t + h), the MRP signal proves to be even more valuable achieving a RMSE/MAPE/MAE of 0.386/12.855/0.263 vs. 0.456/13.584/0.299 using only history (SARIMA). Looking at the plot for our forecasts, Fig. 2c and b show that SARIMA-MRP predictions are better aligned with the observed national ILI rate with tighter upper and lower prediction intervals for both the 1-step and 2-step ahead predictions. These 95% intervals are given by \({\hat{Y}}^{{\rm{ILI}}}(t+h)\pm 1.96\sqrt{{\hat{\sigma }}_{h}}\), where \({\hat{Y}}^{{\rm{ILI}}}(t+h)\) is the point forecast at time step t + h and \({\hat{\sigma }}_{h}\) is the variance of the estimated noise terms (assuming Gaussian errors). More details can be found in21.Fig. 2: National tracking model performance metrics.a Absolute error boxplot. b h = 2-step predictions. c h = 1-step predictions. a Box and Whisker plot of the absolute error of multiple model predictions based on the national percent of ILI visits based on CDC data (T = 123 weeks).

Solid line is the actual CDC ILI visits and the dotted lines are point forecasts based on the SARIMA-HIST and SARIMA-MRP models along with upper and lower prediction intervals for both h = 1 and h = 2-steps ahead. (T = 123 weeks).Full size imagePure history-based models can be very powerful if appropriately trained and tested. To illustrate this, we note that the history-only SARIMA-HIST model outperforms all other approaches in tracking national CDC estimates, save for our demographically sensitive SARIMA-MRP approach. For another recent SARIMA-based Influenza model please see22.State-level performanceThe SARIMA-MRP model performed better than history alone in all four states, and in all the cases it was the outright best model (based on error rates). The improvement of the SARIMA-MRP model was especially sharp with a 2-week horizon. Table 3 displays the root mean squared errors for a horizon of 1 and 2 weeks in each state.DiscussionIn this paper, we tackled a subset of the problems of ILI prediction in the context of search query data. We offer two primary advances. First, existing work has operated without an underlying behavioral model linking search with illness. Here, we use survey data linked with user behavior to observe the connection between ILI symptoms and search behavior more directly than prior research. We find that there is substantial variation in the propensity of users to execute searches in the presence of ILI symptoms based on demographic factors. Next, we leverage these insights and integrate demographic data to account for the uneven propensity of flu search and to build an example ILI tracking model. The MRP-SARIMA tracking model outperforms models containing historical or exogenous signals at 1- and 2-week horizons.The performance of the MRP-SARIMA model is likely influenced by a couple of factors. First, our model tracked ILI prevalence at the state and national level using demographically smoothed (noise-reduced) estimates of flu volumes. Smoothing reduces sensitivity to sparsity among certain population subgroups, reducing error19. The model also re-weighted (bias-reduced) estimates of flu-like query volumes, which brought estimates more in line with known underlying population values. Taken together, demographically re-weighted search signals and human-aided query labeling produces an accurate and near real-time model of flu prevalence at the national and state levels.There are important limitations to this approach. First, research suggests that asking respondents to recall symptoms at increasing lengths of time creates measurement error (Supplementary Information 3.4)23,24,25,26. Health survey research suggests that extending recall windows leads to underreporting of symptoms24,25, while research in public opinion research suggests that dating error is unbiased, but variance increases linearly as the recall period increases. Another recall-related issue is boundary effects—where asking respondents whether they experienced flu or cough from November 1, 2014, to the present, may create errors in judgment that can only be later in time than the start and earlier in time than the beginning of the interval—so errors may pile up near the center of the interval. We checked for differences between respondents who completed the survey earlier compared to those who completed it later, and found no differences (Supplementary Information 3.4).Next, it is challenging to connect all searches to one individual, even if they have indicated they were the sole user of the device (see additional analysis in Supplementary Information 6.2). Some error may stem from searches using devices not containing the tracking software (if a respondent happened to use a friend or spouse’s device).Finally, comparison of our ILI tracking model to the state of the art is challenging, given our relatively modest survey sample, focus on subregional estimates, and relatively limited search stream. We expect that beginning with a larger survey sample and greater search coverage is likely to yield superior results. Similarly, starting with survey data limits the types of search queries that will be observed, necessitating the use of co-occurrence methods such as the DOC2VEC approach. Here, future research might identify A1 searches separate from the survey using a larger search stream. This would encompass a broader range of queries at the outset and obviate the need for DOC2VEC expansion.We tested the practical value of our approach by defining a model to track state-level ILI rates and national ILI rates. The results suggest that constructing a behavioral model of search can yield practical improvements in flu tracking relative to history alone. This provides important lessons for query and social media-based flu tracking systems. Specifically, it demonstrates that forecasters need not use the conventional method of combining massive search query data to a relatively small number of CDC data points, and that creating a behavioral model of search is not only theoretically important but empirically effective.MethodsQuery labelingAs we describe above, we use a hybrid human-computation method for labeling queries in the context of flu experience. We first define a labeling scheme for search queries. The scheme is designed to capture important differences in what the searcher is experiencing at the moment of executing a query, specifically flu-like experiences versus other experiences. We used simple flu-related key words to isolate a subset of queries and web pages from each respondent’s web history to be labeled by trained coders. To ensure reliability of the coding, we used Kappa scores to assess intercoder reliability. Reliability on this set was Kappa = 0.865 for search queries and Kappa = 0.796 for web pages (see Supplementary Information 1.5.4).Then, in order to generate an expansive list of flu-like queries for forecasting, we compute semantic distances between the positively labeled set of queries and other queries executed in the Bing search engine using the DOC2VEC method17. Based on this comparison, we retain all semantically related queries from Bing and label them according to our scheme. This allows us to identify additional flu-like queries for our time-series forecasting models. We also computed intercoder agreement and reliability scores for this set (see Supplementary Information 1.5.4).Lag selection and model evaluationFor the SARIMA-X approach, we selected the appropriate orders (p, P, q, Q) for the model using AIC as a criterion. We set p = 2 in the Lasso-A1 model to account for seasonal effects in ILI rates. However, since we are using the Lasso penalty the coefficients of most of these lags will not appear in the final model. This approach also serves to select the appropriate lag in modeling ILI rates. Finally, we provide predictions for the 2015–2017 seasons by using a rolling 3-year period to train and predict.We use a number of metrics to evaluate model performance. Each metric is some average of the deviation between the prediction and the true value. The first metric we report is root mean squared error (RMSE), which is defined as \({\mathrm{RMSE}}=\sqrt{\frac{1}{n}{\Sigma }_{i = 1}^{n}{\left({y}_{i}-\hat{{y}_{i}}\right)}^{2}}\). This metric penalizes models more strongly when their predictions are far away from the true values. The second is mean average percent error (MAPE), which is defined as MAPE = \(\frac{1}{n}{\Sigma }_{i = 1}^{n}\left|\frac{{y}_{i}-\hat{{y}_{i}}}{{y}_{i}}\right|\). This metric is useful for understanding the average percent difference between the model’s predicted values and the true values and so is fairly easy to interpret. The mean absolute error is similar to the MAPE except it does not take a percentage of the current value: MAE = \(\frac{1}{n}{\Sigma }_{i = 1}^{n}\left|{y}_{i}-\hat{{y}_{i}}\right|\).State flu data preprocessing and setupWe collected flu data on the number of positive influenza swabs from the states of DE, DC, NM, and NY. To do so, we downloaded each state’s data in PDF form and put it into machine-readable format. These states were selected because they (1) collect and publicly post current flu prevalence rates on their official health pages and (2) make historical flu prevalence data available for long enough time spans to be useful for prediction. However, unlike the CDC data, these states do not provide a total number of hospital visits as the denominator to the ILI rate. Thus we only look at the raw counts of the ILI positive cases. Since we are predicting state-level ILI rates and search volumes can be relatively low, the exogenous search signals are often noisier than national-level signals.Based on data availability we use a rolling 2–3 year period to train and predict our models. To compare the different methods we use RMSE as a metric after selecting the model parameters based on the AIC (Akaike Information Criterion). We tested the performance of our model on rolling 1- and 2-week ahead forecasts using exogenous signal at the most predictive lag.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.

Woman who survived 1918 flu pandemic gets COVID vaccineADRIANA DELGADO | Palm Beach Daily NewsWhen Jane Smith was born on June 22, 1918, in a hospital in Syracuse, New York, a new and deadly influenza virus had begun to create panic around the world.Her mother, Catherine Will, fell ill with the flu in August, and 2-month-old Jane also started having symptoms of the disease, presumably transmitted by her mother’s breast milk. Smith survived the flu, but Catherine did not. She died at the age of 25 in November 1918. The flu pandemic, which raged from 1918 to 1919, is estimated to have eventually infected 500 million people — about one-third of the world's population, and killed 50 million, including about 675,000 in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. At 1:45 p.m. Tuesday, Smith, 102, was among the first groups of Palm Beach residents to receive the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine at the South Fire Station on South County Road. The injection didn’t hurt one bit, she said, adding that it was “much better than the flu shot.”Speaking to the Daily News on Monday, Smith said she considered it an honor to be receiving the vaccine the next day.“I’m 102, so I said, ‘What the hell.'"This 102-year-old Florida woman received COVID-19 vaccine, tooExcitement, patience as Palm Beach residents line up for COVID-19 vaccineOnly residents 65 and older are eligible for vaccinations under an executive order issued last month by Gov. Ron DeSantis, which restricts COVID-19 vaccinations in the first phase to nursing home residents and staff, people 65 and older, medical workers and anyone they deem "extremely vulnerable” to COVID-19.Smith was born in a time when there was no influenza vaccine, and no hope for one.Recalling what she had been told of her childhood, Smith said her father, Harold Will, was stationed in France during World War I when the flu hit, so her grandmother "practically kidnapped" her and her mother, taking them out of Syracuse and into Watertown, New York, when the pandemic started getting worse. Smith’s sister, Katherine, was already living outside Syracuse with an aunt.“In those days they had nothing to give you. I think I was supposed to die, but I didn’t, I was lucky to get through it,” Smith said. “My grandmother was worried that they were burying people alive just to get them out of the hospitals. The people they knew were going to die, they just threw them in a dump.”When her father came home from the war he eventually married for the second time, to Ada Halsey, a “wonderful woman,” Smith said.“I've always called her my mother. She brought me and my sister up in New York City, in a lovely five-story house on East 72nd Street,” she said.Smith credits her “very good immune system” for surviving not only the influenza pandemic, but also for being able to recover quickly from childhood illnesses."I was lucky to get through it and I’ve had a very good immune system ever since. My sister and I both got (the) measles when we were kids. I was fine two days later, and she was in bed for like three weeks,” Smith said.Smith would go on to become a buyer for Sibour, a long-gone Manhattan department store, and marry three times, surviving all of her husbands. She married her first husband, Walter Teagle II, at the age of 22.“I’ve had a very active life. I’m widowed too, and I buried them all, so now what do I do?” she joked.She moved from New York to Palm Beach in 1964 with her second husband, Dr. Robert Boggs,and has lived in the town ever since. Her three children, Walter Teagle III, Jayne Keith and Brenda Callaway, who were already in college, remained in New York.Her third husband was Page Smith, whom she married in June 1968. He died in 1998.She doesn’t understand some people’s hesitation to get the COVID-19 vaccine."I think they're crazy not to. Of course, it's safe. If I didn't think it was, I wouldn't be getting it today,” Smith said on Tuesday."It wouldn’t be given to the public if it was going to kill them. The whole thought is ridiculous. I wish they had a vaccine in 1918. So many people wouldn’t have died, including my mother. “Smith hopes that getting the vaccine herself will convince people that it’s safe, and that it's the only way back to some kind of normalcy. "Go for it, don’t be stupid. I’m very proud to put my arm out, get the vaccine and come home and play bridge. Once everyone has it, we can travel the world again and kiss our children and all the rest of it,” she said.

The infection has impacted many states in India. Published: January 6, 2021 6:53 PM IST By India.com Lifestyle Staff | Edited by Anjali Thakur Follow Us What is H10N3 Bird Flu And Why We Don't Need to Worry a Lot Bird flu has been reported in different parts of India, including Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Kerala. Reports say that around 1 lakh birds have died mysteriously in Haryana, whereas in Himachal Pradesh around 1,800 migratory birds were found dead, which has alerted the authorities and they have ordered to cull thousands of birds. There has been a lot of confusion about what exactly is Bird Flu aka Avian flu. Here, we have all frequently asked questions answered. Read on! What is Avian Flu or bird flu? It is a type of influenza virus that causes a highly infectious, severe respiratory disease in birds called avian influenza or bird flu. Human cases of H5N1 avian influenza occur occasionally, but it is difficult to transmit the infection from person to person. When people do become infected, the mortality rate is about 60%. How does it spread? Almost all cases of H5N1 infection in people have been associated with close contact with infected live or dead birds, or H5N1-contaminated environments. The virus does not infect humans easily, and spread from person to person appears to be unusual. There is no evidence that the disease can be spread to people through properly prepared and thoroughly cooked food. What are the symptoms of bird flu? The symptoms may include fever (often high fever, > 38°C) and malaise, cough, sore throat, and muscle aches. Other early symptoms may include abdominal pain, chest pain, and diarrhea. The infection may progress quickly to severe respiratory illness (for example, difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, pneumonia, Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) and neurologic changes (altered mental status or seizures). Can we eat chicken, poultry products, and other wild game birds’ meat? Is it safe? Yes, it is safe to eat properly prepared and cooked poultry and game birds. The virus is sensitive to heat. Normal temperatures used for cooking (so that food reaches 70°C in all parts) will kill the virus. As a standard precaution, WHO recommends that poultry, poultry products, and wild game birds should always be prepared following good hygienic practices and that poultry meat should be properly cooked. To date, a large number of human infections with the H5N1 virus have been linked to the home slaughter and subsequent handling of diseased or dead birds prior to cooking. These practices represent the highest risk of human infection and are the most important to avoid. How is bird flu treated? In most cases, avian influenza in humans develops into a serious disease that should be treated promptly in the hospital and may require intensive care, where available. The antiviral medicine oseltamivir can reduce the severity of illness and prevent death, and should be used in all cases. Is there a vaccine available to protect us from Bird flu? Candidate vaccines to prevent H5N1 infection have been developed, but they are not ready for widespread use.

But it's not the frigid temperatures to blame.Going outside in the cold may bring on a runny nose, but that's not the same as catching a virus.TODAY Illustration / Getty ImagesJan. 7, 2021, 9:18 PM UTCBy Rheana MurrayThis winter, there's a good chance that people will be spending more time than ever outdoors, given restrictions on indoor dining and gatherings related to COVID-19.And, for much of the country, that means a lot of time spent out in the cold. That presents a tricky question: Won't that get us sick? The answer is no. It's an old wives' tale that you'll catch a cold if you go outside in the cold without a coat or hat. That said, there is a link between cold weather and viruses."We call it cold and flu season for good reason," said Dr. Benjamin Singer, a pulmonary and critical care specialist at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago. "Rhinoviruses, which are one of the main causes of the common cold, spike in late fall and early winter, and influenza historically spikes in mid-to-late winter — February, early March."But it's not the cold itself to blame — not exactly, anyway."Respiratory viruses tend to spread much faster during the winter months, and a lot of it has to do not with the temperature, but with people being indoors and being in situations that are more conducive to the spread of the virus," said Dr. Daniel Griffin, an infectious disease expert for ProHEALTH in New York. "It's really the close quarters."The holidays are a big factor: Griffin said spikes in viruses after Thanksgiving and Christmas are so predictable that doctors create their staffing schedules accordingly. And if they don't see a spike in flu cases then, they expect one to happen shortly after spring break in March and April, he said.There may be other reasons people tend to get sicker when it's cold outside, though."We know the ultraviolet of the sun can help kill viruses, but in the winter, the days are shorter, the sun is not as high in the sky, so we have less of that," Griffin said.People also tend to get less vitamin D in the winter, which affects immunity."We say, 'Oh, it doesn't take that much sunlight to get enough vitamin D' — just 15 minutes, completely naked, at the equator," Griffin said. "Nobody does that! When we go outside, we wear clothes, hats, sunscreen that blocks the ultraviolet that allows us to make vitamin D."He pointed out that many Americans are vitamin D deficient, and while people should talk to their doctor about it, in general it's not a bad idea to take vitamin D supplements during the colder months.The dryer air in the winter may be a problem, too. Research has shown that drops in humidity often precede flu outbreaks, according to the National Institutes of Health.That said, while it's common to get a runny nose when you're out in the cold, that doesn't necessarily mean you're getting sick."It is absolutely true that exposure to cold air makes your nose run, but that's a normal reaction that our upper airway and the mucosal membranes in our nose have to cold weather," Singer said. "That's not the same thing as getting a viral infection. And once you get back into a warm and dry environment, that should go away."While there's a known seasonality for the common cold and the influenza virus, it's not yet clear how winter will affect COVID-19, since the virus is relatively new and there isn't enough data.That's why it's even more important that people continue to take precautions, experts say."We haven't seen much flu this year, and I think part of that is that people did a real good job of getting their flu vaccines this year, but I also think people learned a lot about how to keep themselves safe, and hopefully that will continue," Griffin said.Rheana MurrayRheana Murray is the essays editor for TODAY.com.

The human-to-human transfer of avian influenza is 'very rare' and it has no connection with the novel coronavirus.However, those working in the poultry farms should take necessary precautions like wearing PPE kits while working in the farm.The current bird flu outbreak comes barely a few months after India on 30 September last year declared the country free from the disease.Let's take a look at the current infection scenario in India:Kerala - A three-member Central Government team visited Kerala on Thursday to assess the situation arising out of the bird flu outbreak in the Alappuzha and Kottayam districts of the state.In Kerala, as many as 50,935 birds have been culled to stop the spread of the bird flu. This is in addition to the 25,000 odd birds that had died due to the bird flu outbreak in the state.Himachal Pradesh - In the state's Pong wildlife sanctuary, around 381 more migratory birds were found dead, taking the death toll of the birds from the avian influenza to 3,409.Odisha - The Odisha government has asked people to not panic over the incident as the avian influenza virus test came negative in all five selected samples. The Fisheries and Animal Resource Development Department in a statement said that people can consume chicken meat, eggs and other poultry products produced in the state after properly cooking them.Haryana - The state Animal Husband and Dairying department has sent three samples to the High Security Animal Disease Laboratory in Bhopal after the intervention of the Centre. Samples from two were found positive for H5N8 (avian influenza), JP Dalal, Animal Husbandry and Dairying Fisheries Minister of Haryana, said.Rajasthan - Deaths of over 170 new birds were reported from some districts in the state recently, taking the total fatalities to over 425.Jammu and Kashmir - 150 crows were found dead in Jaganoo area of Udhampur district, Jammu and Kashmir amid the bird flu outbreak. Samples of dead crows have been sent for testing to detect if they died from the bird flu.In the wake of several reports of poultry, crows, migratory bird deaths, the Centre has established a central Control room to strategise, co-ordinate and facilitate state governments with regard to outbreak management, disease control and containment.Moreover, two central teams have been deployed to visit the affected states of Kerala, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh for monitoring and for epidemiological investigation.Catch all the Business News , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

Their carcasses have been sent to different laboratories to determine the cause of death."The death of birds could be attributed to bird flu. We are expecting to get results by Tuesday evening. As a protocol, we have imposed prohibitory orders," she said.The local administration has already sounded an alert by banning all the human activities within a 10-km radius of the Pong wetlands in Kangra district, as the bird flu can spread to human beings and turn fatal.Besides the bar-headed geese, other species found dead include the shoveler, the river tern, the black-headed gull and the common teal.Some birds were seen acting strangely before their deaths, Patyal added."When you see that birds are not able to take the flight despite healthy wings, it is really disturbing. At some distance, you find their carcasses," she said.The bird carcasses were sent to the Indian Veterinary Research Institute in Bareilly, the Regional Disease Diagnostic Laboratory in Jalandhar and the Wildlife Institute of India in Dehradun to know their cause of death.Last week, the Rajasthan government had also sounded an alert after confirmation of avian influenza in crows that died in Jhalawar district. Indore in Madhya Pradesh also reported the death of crows, while the mass mortality of poultry birds was reported at one of the largest poultry belts at Barwala near Panchkula in Haryana.According to the Bird Count India, a partnership comprising organisations and groups, over the past 7-10 days, there have been reports of wild birds dying in separate incidents at different locations in the country.AdvertisementThat wild birds die is not necessarily worrying. But it is possible that some of these recent deaths are out of the ordinary, with large numbers dying or reports of diagnoses of H5N1 (avian influenza)."If you encounter a wild bird that is dead or dying, do not approach it, and under any circumstances do not touch it given the possibility (however small) that it might be infected with avian influenza. H5N1 is a highly contagious virus that can cause severe illness in people," it warned.Sensing the gravity of the situation, Nature Conservation Foundation (NCF) scientist K.S. Gopi Sundar told IANS that the situation is truly alarming."We are getting reports of deaths of birds in nature across India. It's likely to be a disease because the deaths are occurring in multiple locations involving multiple species. It is a dangerous situation and needs multi-stakeholder intervention on priority," he said.At the Pong wetlands, preliminary findings of their post mortem have ruled out poisoning as the cause of their death, wildlife officials said.Every winter, the Pong wetlands are home to over 1 lakh birds of nearly 114 species. Among them the bar-headed goose, the northern pintail, the Eurasian coot, the common teal, the common pochard, the northern shoveler, the great cormorant, the Eurasian wigeon and the ruddy shelduck are notable.According to the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS), the Pong wetlands are the only wintering grounds in the world to hold such a large congregation of bar-headed geese.Most of the wetlands in India have been regularly getting bar-headed geese every winter. But Pong is the only habitat that holds the largest influx of bar-headed geese every winter, a BNHS ornithologist told IANS.**The above article has been published from a wire agency with minimal modifications to the headline and text.

Currently, India is facing a double whammy with coronavirus and avian flu looming large. Know the difference between the two and if you should be scared. Written by Arushi Bidhuri |Published : January 9, 2021 3:33 PM IST What started in Wuhan, China took the world by a storm and turned our lives upside down. COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, turned out to be the biggest catastrophe the world has seen since the 1918 pandemic. While India initially saw a slow surge in the coronavirus cases, it soon became the second country with the greatest number of cases. To add to the crisis, bird flu or avian flu has knocked on the doors yet again. With two major diseases looming large in the country, people are bombarded with so much information that they can't seem contemplate the difference between the diseases. To address the dilemma, TheHealthSite asked experts to help readers understand the difference. But first, let us understand what bird flu and coronavirus exactly mean. What Is Bird Flu?Also referred to as avian influenza, it is the diseases caused by the H5N1 influenza virus, which occasionally infects humans. These viruses occur naturally among wild aquatic birds worldwide and can infect domestic poultry and other bird and animal species. According to the World Health Organisation, avian flu does not normally infect humans. However, sporadic human infections with avian flu have occurred. Since the first human case in 1997, H5N1 has killed nearly 60 per cent of the people who have been infected.

It causes many illnesses, including the common cold and flu. Elderly and people with co-morbidities are more likely to develop severe illness. WHO says that most people infected with COVID-19 virus experience mild to moderate respiratory illness, and may recover soon. COVID-19 VS Bird FluBird flu and COVID-19, both are flu-like illnesses with many common and overlapping features, which is why it can be difficult to distinguish between the two. "Both present with symptoms like fever, body ache, cough, cold and breathlessness. Additionally, bird flu patient may develop encephalopathy (damage to the brain) and confusion. Covid patient often have diarrhoea and loss of sense of smell and taste," says Dr Jai Mullerpattan, Consultant Pulmonologist, P.D Hinduja Hospital & MRC. You may like to read He added, "While avian influenza can have a high mortality rate, it rarely spreads from one human to another. It usually spreads through exposure to sick birds such as poultry. Covid-19, on the contrary, spreads rapidly between human. However, the mortality rate is low around 1-3% globally." If Symptoms Are Similar, Is There A Way To Know Which One Is More Virulent?Dr. Lancelot Pinto, Consultant Pulmonologist, P.D Hinduja Hospital & MRC opines, "Person-to-person spread of bird flu does not occur, and it is predominantly transferred to humans from infected poultry and birds. Bird flu is much more virulent in humans as compared to COVID-19 but is fortunately rare among humans." "Oseltamivir is an antiviral that has efficacy against bird flu, while Remdesivir is possibly the only antiviral that may have some effect on SARS-CoV-2." "An RT-PCR for avian influenza (bird flu) would be the test of choice for distinguishing the two and should be sent for all patients with respiratory symptoms in areas where outbreaks of bird flu have been detected in poultry or native birds," he added. TRENDING NOW With the many common symptoms, it may be hard to diagnose just based on clinical features. Dr, Mullerpattan says, "History of travel, occupation etc. may provide clues and confirmation by a throat, or nasal swab test would be necessary."

Since 2003, it has spread from Asia to Europe and Africa. India had notified the first outbreak of avian influenza in 2006 Join Our WhatsApp Channel BusinessToday.In Updated Jan 06, 2021, 1:52 PM IST Influenza flu has gripped many parts of the country, including Kerala, HP, Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan and MP As India prepares for a vaccination plan to wipe out coronavirus, influenza flu or popularly known as bird flu, has gripped many parts of the country. Kerala, Himachal Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh are states with reported bird flu cases among wild geese, crows and ducks. The first instance of humans contracting a similar bird blu, the H5N1 strain, from birds was reported in 1997 after an outbreak at a Hong Kong bird market. Around six people had died of 18 people infected with the avian virus. Since 2003, it has spread from Asia to Europe and Africa. It has become endemic in poultry populations in some countries. India had notified the first outbreak of avian influenza in 2006. However, there's less likelihood of the virus spreading to humans. As per the World Health Organisation (WHO), generally only those who come in direct contact H5N1-affected birds have contracted this virus, and there's no evidence that it spreads from humans to humans, says the WHO. The avian virus dies as the temperature rises so properly cooked food is unlikely to transmit it to humans. Around 1 lakh poultry birds have died mysteriously in the past few days in Haryana. The Pinarayi Vijayan-led government in Kerala has declared bird flu as a state-specific disaster after over 1,700 ducks died in a farm in Kottayam district. In Himachal, around 1,800 migratory birds were found dead at Pong Dam Lake. Around 250 crows were found dead in many districts of Rajasthan. Also read: Bird flu detected in hundreds of dead crows; Centre issues alert "Implementing management practices that incorporate biosecurity principles, personal hygiene, and cleaning and disinfection protocols, as well as cooking and processing standards, are effective means of controlling the spread of the AI viruses," a government statement said. The government has said the disease spreads in India mainly via migratory birds during winter months i.e. from September - October to February - March. "The secondary spread by human handling (through fomites) cannot be ruled out," it adds. Also read: Avian flu confirmed in more than 1,700 dead migratory birds in Himachal Pradesh The Centre has asked the affected states to put in place measures to contain the disease and prevent further spread. These measures are strengthening bio-security of poultry farms; disinfection of affected areas; proper disposal of dead birds/carcasses; timely collection and submission of samples for confirmation; and further surveillance. Meanwhile, according to the WHO, the avian flu outbreaks have resulted in millions of poultry infections, several hundred human cases, and many human deaths. The outbreaks in poultry have also seriously impacted livelihoods, the economy and international trade in affected countries. Another avian influenza A(H5) subtype viruses have also resulted in both outbreaks in poultry and human infections.

Hundreds of ducks have died during the last 10 days in both districts.Five of eight samples sent for testing at the National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD), Bhopal, were found to be positive for the H5N8 strain of bird flu. Kerala’s forest and animal husbandry minister K Raju confirmed this January 4.Raju said as many as 12,000 ducks had died due to the infection in parts of Alappuzha and Kottayam. He added that emergency control rooms led by district veterinary officers had been opened in both districts.As many as 36,000 birds may have to be culled to prevent the spread of the virus infection based on the guidelines from the central government. The state government will decide the compensation for farmers who have lost their flocks because of the infection.Rapid response teams have been constituted to begin culling of birds within a one-kilometre radius from where the H5N8 strain was confirmed, according to the district animal husbandry officer, Alappuzha,The culling operations to prevent the spread of H5N8 strain would continue for a week or more.Mass deaths of ducks were reported from the Nedumudi, Thakazhi, Pallipad and Karuvatta areas in the coastal Alappuzha district.“About 1,650 ducklings belonging to a single farmer’s flock had died at Neendur town,” M Anjana, district collector, Kottayam said.As many as 8,000 birds in a nearby farm also need to be culled as a result of these deaths. The collector added that local fishing in a limited area had been temporarily banned as part of the surveillance and preventive measures.About eight rapid response teams have been formed in Kottayam to undertake surveillance and preventive measures to curb the spread of the virus.Experts have said that unless a mutated strain emerges, the possibility of the infection’s transmission to humans can be ruled out. They pointed to the arrival of migratory birds as the likely cause of the infection.Kerala had reported H5N8 infections in 2016 too. That had led to the mass culling of birds.Various state departments, including the health department have stepped up their surveillance measures to prevent the spread of the infection. A state-wide alert has been issued following the confirmation of the presence of the avian influenza virus.IndiaHealthKeralaAvian Flubird fluAvian flu outbreakAvian influenzaBird cullingKottayamAlappuzha (D)Show CommentsRelated StoriesNo stories found.

Photo by ARUNCHANDRA BOSE/AFP via Getty Image Avian influenza has killed thousands of migratory birds, crows and poultry across at least six Indian states in recent weeks. Now, the country has enacted orders to cull poultry housed near outbreak epicenters, reports the Agence France Presse (AFP). India has seen several avian flu outbreaks in recent years, including 2014, 2018 and 2019, and they usually occur when migratory birds pass through the region in winter. This year, officials have detected two strains of the influenza virus circulating among birds across India. The viruses, which are named based on different versions of the molecules that stud their surfaces, are the H5N1 and H5N8 types. Avian flu is a different type of influenza virus than the ones that normally infect humans each winter, but the health experts worry that at some point, an avian flu strain could find a way to infect and pass between humans. Measures like culling domestic birds near outbreak areas limit the chances that such a jump could happen. The federal government has asked states to be on “high alert” and take “urgent measures” to reduce the spread of the avian influenza, reports BBC News. The H5N8 avian flu has killed about 12,000 ducks in Kerala, a state in southern India, per the AFP. The state plans to cull more than 38,000 birds with the help of nineteen rapid response teams, Rhea Mogul and Swati Gupta report for CNN. The teams are culling domesticated birds and, in some regions, their eggs as well. Meanwhile, migratory birds in the northern state of Himachal Pradesh tested positive for the H5N1 avian flu virus. Thousands of birds, mostly bar-headed geese, died of the infection. “The death toll in the last week or so at the Pong lake crossed 2,400 migratory birds. Over 600 birds died on Monday,” says state wildlife chief Archana Sharma to the AFP. Western states have seen hundreds of crow deaths associated with H5N1 and H5N8 infections in recent weeks, per the AFP. "The birds affected are migratory birds. All we can do is follow the strategy of clearing up the area of contamination,” explains Sharma to CNN. “We comb the entire area of the sanctuary and we physically send 10 teams every day who search for any dead birds and dispose of them.” Although the news of the avian flu outbreaks is unsettling, officials have made assurances that the situation is under control. Last winter, several countries along migratory birds’ routes experienced avian flu outbreaks, according to the World Health Organization. The domestic birds caught the disease from wild birds, and it did not pass to humans. In 2008, India saw its most devastating avian flu outbreak which resulted in the culling of millions of domesticated birds, per the AFP. Avian influenza can infect more than 100 species of wild birds and poultry. Culling measures help to limit opportunities for the virus to jump from the birds into people. The virus passes from animal to animal through the birds’ saliva, nasal secretions and feces, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In rare cases, the virus can pass from those substances to people directly, but the virus can also reach humans by jumping from a bird to another animal like a pig, and then into people. According to the CDC website, avian influenza A viruses rarely infect humans and typically occur exposure to infected poultry. India has not detected any cases of avian flu in people during the current outbreak. On Wednesday, Minister of Animal Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries Giriraj Singh told public service broadcaster Doordarshan, "There is no need to panic,” CNN reports.

A series of outbreaks have been reported in Europe in the past weeks, with wild birds suspected to be spreading the disease. The central government confirmed on Wednesday that avian influenza, or bird flu, cases were reported across 12 epicentres in at least four Indian states even as authorities issued advisories to contain further spread of the outbreak and asked all states to keep a close vigil to detect any unusual bird death. Wildlife officials collecting carcasses of birds that died due to bird flu (H5N1) in the Pong Dam wetland in Kangra district of Himachal Pradesh over the past week.(HT Photo) Thousands of birds have died in Kerala (mostly poultry), Himachal Pradesh (migratory birds), and Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh (crows) since the beginning of the outbreak in December-end. Officials said migratory birds are behind the outbreak. The government said it has set up a “control room” in New Delhi to keep a watch on the situation. No case among humans has been reported. In addition to the four states with confirmed cases, around 400,000 chickens have died in Haryana’s Panchkula district over the past 20 days. Similarly, three crows are suspected to have died due to the disease in Uttarakhand’s capital Dehradun. Their test reports were awaited. Jharkhand and Gujarat, too, have sounded an alarm. The Union health ministry said it has deployed special teams in Panchkula, apart from Kerala’s two epicentres. Experts said the current outbreak is caused by the H5N8 strain, though there are other strains circulating globally. A series of outbreaks have been reported in Europe in the past weeks, with wild birds suspected to be spreading the disease. Experts added that both H5N1 (another strain of avian influenza) and H5N8 have high pathogenicity (the ability of a pathogen to cause disease), but they don’t infect humans very effectively. However, past outbreaks among farm birds have needed extensive slaughtering programmes. “…people who are handling birds (culling them or handling meat) should be careful and take full precautions. If it does transmit to humans, the influenza can be very severe...Human-to-human transmission is also not common, but can happen. Eating properly cooked poultry is unlikely to transmit the infection. We have had several bird flu episodes in the past but managed to control them,” said Dr Shobha Broor, former head of the department of microbiology at Delhi’s All India Institute of Medical Sciences. The current outbreak began barely a few months after India declared the country free from the disease on September 30, 2020. India notified the first outbreak of avian influenza in 2006. “Bird flu cases can be found all over the world. India was declared free of bird flu in September. Then in October, we issued an advisory that the cold is coming and that there is a need to take precautions. Today, most of the cases are being reported from the places where migratory birds arrive, and they are the reason for bringing the virus to the country,” Giriraj Singh, the Union minister of fisheries, animal husbandry and dairying, told news agency ANI. “The government is on alert. Samples from all states are being sent to Bhopal (for testing at the National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases). There is nothing to worry about. The government will also provide compensation to the farmers for the poultry that died,” Singh said. In a statement, his ministry identified 12 disease epicentres: Baran, Kota, Jhalawar regions in Rajasthan; Mandsaur, Indore, Malwa areas in Madhya Pradesh; Kangra in Himachal Pradesh; and Kerala’s Kottayam and Alappuzha (four epicentres). In India, the ministry said, the disease spreads mainly by migratory birds during winter months from September-October to February-March. The secondary spread by human handling (through fomites) cannot be ruled out. “Infection in humans is not yet reported in India though the disease is zoonotic. There is no direct evidence that AI (avian influenza) viruses can be transmitted to humans via the consumption of contaminated poultry products,” it added. Over 69,000 birds, including ducks and chickens, were culled in Alappuzha and Kottayam, Kerala animal husbandry minister K Raju said on Wednesday. His government has declared bird flu as a state disaster. Rapid response teams are on the ground for culling and surveillance efforts. “The state cabinet, which met today (Wednesday), has decided to compensate the farmers for culling their birds. For culled birds over two months old, farmers will be given ₹200 for each… for those under the age of two months, farmers will be compensated at ₹100 for each,” the minister said. Madhya Pradesh has banned transportation of poultry from other states as a measure to check the spread, government officials said. “Testing of poultry samples from districts affected by bird flu suggests poultry is not affected, but as a precautionary measure, the Mandsaur district administration has ordered a ban on the sale and purchase of chicken and eggs... 250 crows have been found dead so far in the district,” said JN Kansotia, the state’s animal husbandry principal secretary. In Himachal, there was a complete ban on the sale and export of poultry products and fish in the four subdivisions of Dehra, Fatehpur, Jawali and Indora, according to Kangra deputy commissioner Rakesh Kumar Prajapati. “We can’t stop it (movement of migratory birds); it will continue till February-end,” said Prajapati. Panchkula civil surgeon Dr Jasjeet Kaur said six screening teams were sent to the worst-hit Barwala belt, considered Asia’s second largest poultry belt with over 7.7 million birds in 110 farms. Across states, poultry farm owners feared losses due to the culling of birds --- a likely outcome of the outbreak. “I have more than 40,000 chickens at my farm. If the virus spreads, culling would be carried out and that would mean losses worth lakhs or rupees,” said Pushp Barotia, a poultry farm owner in Kangra. The scare has led to a drop in chicken prices in many parts of the country. Annu Gulati, an office-bearer of the Uttar Pradesh Poultry Farm Association, said prices have come down to ₹20-25 per kg.

Can you eat eggs and chicken now? Does bird flu spread to humans as well? Bird flu concerns explainedListen to StoryLive TVShareAdvertisementChickens at a poultry farm in Amritsar, Punjab where state authorities have issued alert following bird flu outbreak in neighbouring Himachal Pradesh, which has seen deaths of hundreds of migratory birds due to avian influenza. (Photo: PTI)Prabhash K DuttaNew Delhi,UPDATED: Jan 8, 2021 18:20 ISTBird flu outbreaks have become frequent and common in recent years across the globe. India is currently facing bird flue outbreaks in states such as Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Kerala and Madhya Pradesh, and a scare in some others such as Punjab, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Karnataka and Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir. Hundreds of birds have already died and authorities warn of possible transmission from birds to humans. Culling of birds is underway in the affected areas from Himachal Pradesh to Kerala.advertisementWhat is bird flu?It is influenza among birds, hence also called avian influenza. This viral disease is caused by Influenza Type-A virus that commonly affects both wild and poultry birds. This virus has several strains, most of them causing mild symptoms and affecting low egg production. But some variants are lethal causing loss of avian lives. The current outbreak has evidence of H5N1 and H8N1 strains of virus causing death of birds.How do flu outbreaks spread among birds? Some wild varieties of birds such as ducks and geese are considered to be the natural reservoirs of Influenza Type-A viruses. It is believed that certain birds carry the variants of flu viruses without becoming sick and spread the disease to other birds through their droppings.Birds can relieve themselves while flying, the carrier birds spread the flu virus globally. And, usually, bird flu outbreaks coincide with the seasons when migratory birds are in large number in a region.This is the season when several states of India become home to many migratory birds. Himachal Pradesh, for example, has seen hundreds of migratory birds dying of avian influenza this season.What are the chances of bird flu transmitting to humans? The avian flu virus spreads from aquatic varieties to terrestrial birds including poultry and from them sometimes to animals such as dogs, cats, pigs and horses. Spread of bird flu from birds and animals is not a common occurrence.The first recorded occurrence of bird flu among humans came from its outbreak in 1997 in Hong Kong. The outbreak happened from a live bird market in Hong Kong. The strain was identified as H5N1 with a high mortality rate. Six of 18 confirmed cases among humans died.Read: In a graphic: Bird flu takes flight again | India Today InsightSince then more than 50 countries have detected avian influenza. According to the US Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), six countries are considered endemic for H5N1 virus in poultry. It includes India. Others are China, Bangladesh, Vietnam, Indonesia and Egypt. Bird flu re-emerged in 2003 on a bigger scale affecting many countries after that.How it may spread to humans? Spread of bird flu among humans is not easy. People-to-people spread of bird flu is not common. Those who work in close contacts with infected birds, dead or alive, and eat uncooked or half-cooked poultry products including chicken meat are at risk.The World Health Organisation (WHO) clearly says that there is no evidence to suggest that the disease can spread through properly cooked food. Like all viruses, bird flu virus is also sensitive to heat and dies at cooking temperature or over 60 degree Celsius.However, due to constant mutation that viruses go through, the scientists have warned that a new variant poses a danger of turning a bird flu outbreak into a pandemic. The threat is considered more serious in the wake of Covid-19 pandemic that began from a Chinese city towards the end of 2019 and became a lethal pandemic in the first quarter of 2020.What if somebody catches bird flu? Bird flu usually affects the gut area among the birds but when the disease spreads to humans, it becomes a respiratory tract illness. It may cause ARDS or Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, similar to one caused by Covid-19.Early symptoms of bird flu among humans are fever, cough and sore throat. Sometimes, an infected person may complain of abdominal pain and suffer diarrhoea. All these symptoms are seen in the case of Covid-19 as well.advertisementBird Flu in India Updates: Central team takes stock of situation in Kerala as influenza scare spreadsHowever, there is one key difference, that is, the H5N1 virus has its receptors deep inside the human lungs unlike H1N1 — which causes swine flu — or SARS-CoV-2 which causes Covid-19. These two viruses have their receptors in the upper respiratory system such as nasal cavities of humans.Though there is no specific medicine for bird flu among humans, some antiviral drugs such as oseltamivir helps speedier recovery and greater chances of survival. There is no vaccine for protection against bird flu yet.In India, the Union health ministry’s advisory says that those working or dealing with poultry should use PPE and strictly maintain hand hygiene.Past instances of bird flu in India Bird flu outbreaks have taken place on multiple occasions in India since 2006 when it was first recorded in Gujarat and Maharashtra. At least 15 states have reported the cases of bird flu in India since then.advertisementHowever, there has been no recorded case of bird flu among humans in India. But if somebody shows symptoms and wants to be sure, a throat swab is taken from the patient to test for avian flu.And finally, can we eat eggs and chickens? Yes, if you normally do. A properly cooked egg or chicken meat or any poultry product for that matter is safe to consume.Published By: Prabhash Kumar DuttaPublished On: Jan 8, 2021--- ENDS --- Watch Live TV AdvertisementAlso WatchVideo: Anushka Sharma, Virat Kohli leave Mumbai after brief stayOwaisi targets PM ahead of Maharashtra polls, says he does not believe in diversityWatch: 1st batch of India players leave for Australia for Border Gavaskar TrophyJawan killed, 3 injured in encounter in Jammu and Kashmir's KishtwarA look at 'Black Hornet' micro drones deployed for anti-terror ops in J&KAdvertisementRead ThisMan kills 3-month-old infant over feud with father in Madhya PradeshPremier League: Arsenal draw Chelsea 1-1 in London DerbyPisces Daily Horoscope Today (Feb 19-Mar 20), November 11, 2024: Your relationships will strengthen!Aquarius Daily Horoscope Today (Jan 20- Feb 18), November 11, 2024: Financial matters will improve!Capricorn Daily Horoscope Today (Dec 22-Jan 19), November 11, 2024: You’ll stay focused!TRENDING TOPICSMaharashtra Assembly PollsAdvertisement Follow Us On: Advertisement PUBLICATIONSIndia TodayBusiness TodayIndia Today-HindiTIME TELEVISIONIndia Today TVAaj Tak Good News TodayEVENTSAgenda AajTakIndia Today ConclaveSahitya AajTak RADIOIshq FMAajTak RadioGAMINGIndia Today Gaming World Esports CupUSEFUL LINKSPress ReleaseSitemapNewsNewsletter Privacy PolicyCorrection PolicyLMIL DocumentsPRINTINGThomson PressWELFARECare TodayDISTRIBUTIONRate Card SYNDICATIONS Headlines Today WEBSITES India Today India Today Malayalam India Today NE Business Today DailyO AajTak Lallantop Bangla GNTTV iChowk Reader’s Digest Cosmopolitan EDUCATION Vasant Valley Best Colleges Best Universities TRENDING TOPICSAMU Minority Status Salman Khan Death ThreatLATESTVijay 69 ReviewHoroscope TodayDownload App ABOUT US CONTACT US TERMS AND CONDITIONS ARCHIVES Copyright © 2024 Living Media India Limited.

If you’re unlucky enough to get one, or both viruses, Cleveland Clinic infectious disease specialist, Dr. Susan Rehm, said many people can care for themselves at home. Recommended Videos“People with milder cases of influenza, or COVID, should pay attention to staying hydrated, monitor their temperature, monitor their breathing, get some rest and obviously isolate,” she said. Flu and coronavirus have similar symptoms and are nearly impossible to tell apart without testing. Rehm recommends calling your healthcare provider if you suspect either illness -- because testing and treatment options differ. While there aren’t any approved outpatient treatments for COVID-19, there are prescription antiviral medicines available to treat flu. Regardless of the virus you’re fighting, it’s important to recognize signs of distress and when to seek immediate help.“People should consider going to the emergency room, or calling their doctor, if they have severe shortness of breath, confusion, productive cough -- meaning bringing up a lot of sputum with coughing -- or any other symptom that’s causing them distress that they can’t take care of themselves at home,” Rehm said. As we wait our turn for COVID-19 vaccine, Rehm reminds us there’s already a vaccine available to help prevent flu. She says in the midst of a pandemic, it’s more important than ever to get a flu shot. Copyright 2021 by Cleveland Clinic News Service.

Government authorities, meanwhile, have also asked states affected by bird flu to 'prepare for any eventuality'. While coronavirus cases continue to soar across the world, we have another reason to worry- the emergence of bird flu.According to official sources, several states in India, including Himachal Pradesh, Kerala, Punjab and Rajasthan are witnessing avian bird influenza which has already killed a lot of birds and forced the authorities to cull off thousands of other bird species.Experts are also worried that the current strain of the infection, H5N1, considered to be the most lethal one, is also something that could turn into a pandemic if not controlled in time and preventive steps are taken. Government authorities, meanwhile, have also asked states affected by bird flu to 'prepare for any eventuality'.While this year's Avian influenza is not the first one we have seen, bird flu is one such infectious disease which can easily pass on from birds onto humans. It has also sparked fears amongst poultry and non-vegetarians if it is safe to eat poultry and produce since the strain can also infect humans.If you are worried, here's an explainer on the same.How can bird flu infect humans?While Avian flu is the most dangerous for birds, the infection can transmit to humans through faeces and other droppings. However, do remember that bird flu cannot spread from humans to humans. There have been rare recorded cases worldwide. Upon infection, humans can go through a host of respiratory symptoms such as the ones caused by ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) including cough, cold, chest pain, sore throat. Considering the risk of catching bird flu is on the higher side right now, there are also fears that people may develop bird flu by eating poultry produce such as eggs, or bird meat in itself. Can you get bird flu by consuming eggs and poultry?Scientifically, there's little evidence to support the fact that bird flu can spread to healthy people via produce like eggs and meat. Any food item, egg or bird meat which is thoroughly washed and cooked is safe to eat and does not act as the carrier of the virus. The same has also been attested by the WHO. Whenever any meat or poultry produce is exposed to heat, it kills any germs, pathogens or viruses which may be present on the surface (or even beneath it). Hence, cooking your produce thoroughly makes it safer for use. This is also a precautionary step people should take before consuming any type of non-veg food. According to experts, a cooking temperature of upto 70-degree celsius that reaches all parts of the produce or meat is good to kill germs.Depending on the produce, an added step of boiling produce may also be taken. The WHO, in its past advisory also suggested people practice safe hygienic practices before procuring or cooking any produce, and make sure to source ingredients from organic, trusted places. Slaughtered meat or handling of dead or diseased birds before cooking is the one which is the riskiest right now. The UN Food and Agriculture Organisation also recommends that one of the best ways to minimize your risk of infection is by keeping infected birds away from the food chain at all levels- that is ensure you procure your products from genuine, trusted sources. Should you wash eggs and chicken before use?While many would feel washing produce under running water would wash away bacteria and germs, it might not be the case. A better way to do so would be to use a gentle paper towel to do away with the sliminess and then proceed to thoroughly cook it under suitable temperatures.All India Institute of Medical Sciences also recommends that people follow precaution while buying eggs- do not buy the ones which are too stale. Ensure it is good for consumption and hygienic cooking practices are followed at all levels. Even though cooking kills the germs, If you do go to a restraunt to eat, or order in, try and ask for quality checks beforehand. Hence, one of the best ways to stay safe would be to adopt good measures on your own end and eat home-cooked food, as much as possible.For example, while cooking an egg, ensure that the yellow yolk becomes firm and avoid eating runny eggs during the course of the outbreak.Lastly, do remember that we are already in the middle of a wide-spread pandemic. Wash your hands with good quality soap and water for 20-30 seconds before and after cooking. As long as you follow good hand hygiene, take care of your source of produce and cook it well, there's no real reason to worry.

The ministry issued a set of guidelines January 3, 2021 in view of Himachal Pradesh and Rajasthan reporting several deaths in December alone, including that of migratory birds. Many birds migrate to India every year during the winters for food, breeding and nesting. According to the letter: “Considering this grave situation, the ministry requests all states / Union territories to take all possible measures / precautions to prevent the transmission of diseases, if any, in other animals / birds and human beings. Surveillance for mortality of wildlife, particularly in needs to be taken up on priority and States are requested to report such incidences of mortality to this ministry.” The guidelines have asked all states to report to the Union ministry every week. It also laid down protocols for personal and bird care as well as monitoring of migratory birds.As many as 250 crows in Rajasthan have died due to bird flu since December, 2020. At least 1,700 migratory birds in Himachal Pradesh have died during the same time, reasons for which are being ascertained, according to Additional Director General (Wildlife) at MOEF&CC, Soumitra Dasgupta.According to Dasgupta: “We have received reports from Himachal Pradesh and Rajasthan about the deaths of birds. Preliminary reports attribute the deaths in Himachal Pradesh to bird flu, but we have sent the samples to High-Security Animal Disease Laboratory in Bhopal. We have taken proactive measures and written to states with guidelines on how to handle this. We are in touch with the animal husbandry department as they are the nodal ministry that deals with bird flu.” The guidelinesIn terms of personal care, the guidelines stated, the personnel should wear rubber gloves and protective clothing that can be disinfected or disposed of, including protective eyewear and face shield.“The influenza virus is sensitive to many common disinfectants such as detergents, 10 per cent household bleach, alcohol and other commercial disinfectants. The virus is much more difficult to inactivate if it is encrusted in organic material such as faeces or soil,” the guidelines states.It said influenza anti-viral drug has to be taken daily for the entire time one is in direct contact with infected birds or a contaminated environment. For bird care, the guidelines stated: It should be ensured that wild birds are not harmed during trapping and collection of serum samples. Preference should be given to the leg vein instead of the wing vein. Wing vein blood collection is reported to result in hemorrhage affecting normal flight, making them susceptible to predators. All wild bird samples are valuable; hence collection of samples, packing and transport should be done in collaboration with trained animal husbandry / veterinary staff Awareness should be spread that any sighting of a dead bird by volunteers, bird watchers, etc. should be reported to the nearest forest / animal husbandry office To better monitor the migratory birds, a state-level committee has to be formed which will come with an action plan “Surveillance should not be restricted to the Protected Areas alone, but to all such wetlands and habitats that provide staging grounds to the migrating birds and to areas where there is a possibility of interaction of migratory birds and poultry, more so in backyard poultry,” the guidelines said.All states are required to immediately report to the Union ministry in case of any bird deaths.“If the novel coronavirus disease has taught us anything, it is that we have to live with these diseases and be prepared for them. In this regard, monitoring health of birds is very important. We have to keep collecting samples frequently, whether there is an outbreak or not,” said Asad Rehmani, former director of the Bombay Natural History Society.“The last time a big number of bird deaths was reported was in 2010-11. Since then, have been sporadic reports of deaths by bird flu. We have acted in time prevent the situation from spiralling out of control,” Dashgupta said.IndiaWildlife & Biodiversitybird habitatHimachal PradeshRajasthanbird fluMinistry of Environment and Forests and Climate Change (MoEF&CC)Avian influenzaShow CommentsRelated StoriesNo stories found.

India notified the first outbreak of avian influenza in 2006. Infection in humans is not yet reported in India though the disease is zoonotic. There is no direct evidence that AI viruses can be transmitted to humans via the consumption of contaminated poultry products. Implementing management practices that incorporate biosecurity principles, personal hygiene, and cleaning and disinfection protocols, as well as cooking and processing standards, are effective means of controlling the spread of the AI viruses. In India, the disease spreads mainly by migratory birds coming into India during winter months i.e. from September – October to February – March. The secondary spread by human handling (through fomites) cannot be ruled out. In view of a threat of global outbreak of AI, the Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying (DAHD), Government of India had prepared an action plan in 2005 which was revised in 2006, 2012 , 2015 and 2021 for guidance of State Government for prevention, control and containment of Avian Influenza in the Country (refer DAHD website https://dahd.nic.in/sites/default/filess/Action%20Plan%20-%20as%20on23.3.15.docx-final.pdf10.pdf). Following post operation surveillance plan (POSP) after completion of Avian Influenza outbreak control in 2020 and containment operation at different epicenters, the country freedom from AI was declared w.e.f. 30th September 2020. In view of the past experience regarding the reports of the disease in winter season, periodic advisories have been issued to all states/UTs before commencement of winter for keeping necessary vigil, enhancing surveillance, keeping strategic reserves of supplies (PPE kits, etc.), preparedness to handle eventualities and IEC for public awareness. Other support provided by the Department to the States/UTs include Technical support from referral lab i.e. ICAR-NIHSAD, Bhopal Funding support to States/UTs to undertake culling and compensation Funding to states under ASCAD scheme Training of veterinary work force Support for strengthening RDDLs / CDDL The last preparatory advisory/communication was issued to all States/UTs on 22.10.2020. Present outbreak After confirmation of positive samples from ICAR-NIHSAD, AI has been reported from the following States (at 12 epicenters) – Rajasthan(crow) – Baran, Kota, Jhalawar Madhya Pradesh(crow) – Mandsaur, Indore, Malwa Himachal Pradesh (migratory birds) – Kangra Kerala (poultry-duck) – Kottayam, Allapuzha (4 epicentres) Accordingly, an advisory has been issued each to the States of Rajasthan and MP on 1st January 2021, so as to avoid further spread of the infection. As per the information received from State of Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan control measures is being taken as per the guidelines of National Action Plan of Avian Influenza. Another advisory has been issued on 5th January, 2021 to HP where the State has been advised to take measures so as to avoid further spread of disease to poultry. As per the report received, Kerala has already initiated control and containment operations from 05.01.20121 at epicentres and culling process is in operation. Department of Animal Husbandry & Dairying, Government of India has also set up a control room in New Delhi to keep watch on the situation and to take stock on daily basis of preventive and control measures undertaken by State authorities. The measures suggested to the affected States to contain the disease and prevent further spread as per the Action Plan on Avian Influenza include strengthening the biosecurity of poultry farms, disinfection of affected areas, proper disposal of dead birds/carcasses, timely collection and submission of samples for confirmation and further surveillance, intensification of surveillance plan as well as the general guidelines for prevention of disease spread from affected birds to poultry and human. Coordination with forest department for reporting any unusual mortality of birds was also suggested to the States. The other states were also requested to keep a vigil on any unusual mortality amongst birds and to report immediately to take necessary measures.

In Haryana, a large number of chickens have been suspected to have died in poultry farms in Panchkula. In Indore, Madhya Pradesh, 152 birds were also killed, 12 of whom were confirmed to have the virus. In Madhya Pradesh’s Mandsaur, 250 birds have died in a week, out of which four have had bird flu virus. In Himachal Pradesh, more than 2,300 migratory birds have died in Kangra’s Pong Dam. Around 1,700 ducks have died on the farm due to the virus infection. Officials said around 40,000 domestic birds, including 34,000 in Kuttanad region alone, will be culled to check the spread of the H5N8 virus. Over 170 new bird deaths were reported in Rajasthan on Monday, amid an outbreak of bird flu in some parts of the country, officials said. According to the Animal Husbandry department, over 425 deaths of crows, herons and other birds have been reported in the state so far.

What is Bird Flu? Avian influenza refers to the disease caused by infection with avian (bird) influenza (flu) Type A viruses. These viruses occur naturally among wild aquatic birds worldwide and can infect domestic poultry and other bird and animal species. Avian influenza is a viral disease that is contagious and can spread from one bird to other birds and animals. Many birds die due to this disease. It can also be transmitted to humans. Avian flu viruses do not normally infect humans. However, sporadic human infections with avian flu viruses have occurred. All over the world, 18,64,000 people died of the coronavirus within a year and the corona mortality rate is 3% at this time. While the mortality rate of patients infected with Bird Flu is 60%. This means that Bird Flu is much more dangerous for humans than the coronavirus. The mortality rate of patients with Bird Flu is 20 times higher than that of the corona. After being infected with Bird Flu, the symptoms begin to appear in a person within 2 to 8 days. What are the symptoms? Fever, cough, runny nose, headache, swelling in the throat, muscle ache, stomach issues, difficulty in breathing, infection in the eye. Like the coronavirus, the bird flu virus can also be fatal. These viruses can also kill humans like birds. In humans, the virus of the Bird Flu enters the eye, nose and mouth. Therefore, your best effort should be not to be infected with this virus. The two biggest questions in your mind will be whether we can eat eggs or chicken? Yes, eggs can be eaten, however, these should be hard-boiled or well-cooked. According to the World Health Organization, eating at a temperature of 60 to 70 degrees Celsius does not cause virus infection. Those who eat chicken should be careful as only well-cooked chicken should be eaten, eating half-cooked chicken can be dangerous. People who give food to pigeons should be careful too. Wearing facemasks, keeping surroundings clean and washing hands are of utmost importance.

The local medical team has been asked to conduct surveillance within 1 km of the infected area, reported ANI.Animal Husbandry Minister Prem Singh Patel, according to ANI, said:“An alert has been sounded in Madhya Pradesh to control the deaths of crows in the state. Between 23 December and 3 January, 142 crows died in Indore, 100 in Mandsaur, 112 in Agar Malwa and 13 crows died in Khargone districts.”ADVERTISEMENTREMOVE ADAlso ReadAvian Flu: Officials Find Monitoring Unlicensed Shops DifficultHP On High AlertFurther, with the death toll of migratory water birds rising to 2,401, and almost half of them being endangered bar-headed goose visiting the Pong wetlands, Himachal Pradesh wildlife authorities on Monday said that avian influenza was the cause.The dead reportedly included a little white-fronted goose that was visiting the Pong wetlands alone for the past three years.Kerala On High AlertMeanwhile, in Kerala, as a precautionary measure to stop the spread of the virus, as many as 48,000 birds will be culled.On 5 January, the state issued bird flu as a state-specific disaster alert after confirmed cases in Kottayam and Alappuzha districts, reported Hindustan Times. Over 1,700 ducks died in a Kottayam farm.Health Minister K Sudhakar directed health officers in border districts of Karnataka to remain vigilant on Tuesday, reported PTI.The central government has also issued an alert to the states, according to Business Insider, saying that samples need to be collected from areas where bird flu deaths are being reported.MP On High AlertThe states of Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, too, are on high alert following the death of hundreds of crows. Around 155 crows have been found dead in Indore, MP and have tested positive for bird flu, reported PTI.The bird flu can spread to human beings and turn fatal, though such instances are rare.Some birds, including the bar-headed goose, were also reported to be acting strangely before their deaths.Chief Conservator Wildlife of Pong wetlands, Upasana Patyal, said, according to IANS:"When you're seeing that birds are not able to take flight despite healthy wings, it's really disturbing. At some distance, you find their carcasses.”Also ReadCulling of Birds Begins to Contain Avian Influenza in KeralaAlert Issued in RajasthanAccording to IANS, Rajasthan government last week sounded an alert after confirmation of avian influenza in crows that died in Jhalawar district. So far, 425 birds have died in the state.The mass mortality of poultry birds was reported at one of the largest poultry belts at Barwala near Panchkula in Haryana.Over the past seven to 10 days, there have been reports of wild birds dying in separate incidents at different locations in the country, reported IANS, citing Bird Count India.Maharashtra has not reported any cases of bird flu so far according to principal chief conservator of forests (wildlife), Nitin Kakodkar, reported PTI.Multi-Stakeholder Intervention Needed on PriorityThat wild birds die is not necessarily worrying. But it is possible that some of these recent deaths are out of the ordinary, with large numbers dying or reports of diagnoses of H5N1 (avian influenza), reported IANS.According to IANS, at the moment, no one knows whether these are causes of larger concern, but it is worth keeping an eye on the situation.Experts, according to IANS, warn:“If you encounter a wild bird that is dead or dying, do not approach it, and under any circumstances do not touch it given the possibility (however small) that it might be infected with avian influenza. H5N1 is a highly contagious virus that can cause severe illness in people.”(With inputs from PTI, Hindustan Times, IANS, Business Standard and ANI.)(At The Quint, we question everything.

View in App So, are eggs, chicken safe to eat amid bird flu? Here is the answer from World Health Organisation (WHO) Pixabay pic. Avian Influenza Virus Latest Update: In an alarming development, several states have already sounded an alert to contain the H5N8 strain of bird flu and sent samples for testing while Kerala began culling of chickens and ducks. It has raised a big question meat-lovers minds - are eggs and chicken safe to eat? Karnataka and Tamil Nadu stepped up surveillance and formed guidelines following the outbreak of the viral infection in neighbouring Kerala, where around 1,700 ducks have died due to the flu. In Haryana, over four lakh poultry birds have died at farms in Panchkula district in the past 10 days. In Madhya Pradesh, officials said that 155 dead crows in Indore have been found with the H5N8 strain since the pathogen was first detected in the city a week back, while in Rajasthan, after Jhalwar, birds in Kota and Baran were found with the infection. However, no cases have been reported yet in Maharashtra, which shares borders with Madhya Pradesh. Officials in Himachal Pradesh surveyed the area around the Pong Dam Lake sanctuary in Kangra district to check the spread of the flu to domestic poultry birds, a day after samples of dead migratory birds there tested positive for H5N8. So, are eggs, chicken safe to eat amid bird flu? Here is the answer from World Health Organisation (WHO), a specialized agency of the United Nations (UN) responsible for international public health:- EGGS, CHICKEN SAFE? - Chicken and other poultry are safe to eat if cooked properly, according to a joint statement by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Health Organization (WHO) issued to national food safety authorities. - However, no birds from flocks with disease should enter the food chain. - In areas where there is no avian influenza outbreak in poultry, there is no risk that consumers will be exposed to the virus via the handling or consumption of poultry or poultry products. - Cooking of poultry (e.g. chicken, ducks, geese, turkeys and guinea-fowl) at or above 70°Celsius throughout the product, so that absolutely no meat remains raw and red, is a safe measure to kill the H5N1 virus in areas with outbreaks in poultry, FAO/WHO said. - This ensures that there is no active virus remaining if the live bird has been infected and has mistakenly entered the food chain. Recommended good hygienic practices to reduce exposure to the virus in areas with outbreaks in poultry - No birds from flocks with disease should enter the food chain. - Do not eat raw poultry parts, including raw blood, or raw eggs in or from areas with outbreaks in poultry. - Separate raw meat from cooked or ready-to-eat foods to avoid contamination. - Do not use the same chopping board or the same knife. - Do not handle both raw and cooked foods without washing your hands in between and do not place cooked meat back on the same plate or surface it was on prior to cooking. - Do not use raw or soft-boiled eggs in food preparations that will not be heat treated or cooked. Keep clean and wash your hands. - After handling frozen or thawed raw poultry or eggs, wash your hands thoroughly with soap. Wash and disinfect all surfaces and utensils that have been in contact with the raw meat. - Cook thoroughly: Thorough cooking of poultry meat will inactivate the virus. Either ensure that the poultry meat reaches 70°C at the centre of the product (“piping” hot) or that the meat is not pink in any part. - Egg yolks should not be runny or liquid.

Nine RRTs led by veterinary surgeons culled 20,300 ducks at Pallippad, Karuvatta, Nedumudi and Thakazhi panchayats in Alappuzha district. In Kottayam district’s Neendoor grama panchayat, 3,810 birds were culled.T K Santhosh Kumar, Alappuzha district animal husbandry officer, said, “The team members wearing PPE kit killed the ducks and burnt them. After the burial of the remains, the department sanitised the areas. The step was taken to avoid the spread of H5N8 strain of the influenza virus to other areas. The virus infection has been identified in four panchayats in the district and testing is progressing to identify whether the disease has spread to more areas.”The virus infection found in one farm each in the four panchayats where around 24,000 ducks died in two weeks. The preliminary survey by the department identified around 50,000 ducks in total in the region in one-kilometre radius of the four farms where the outbreak has been reported. In ward 14 of Neendoor panchayat in Kottayam, RRT killed domestic birds, including pets and ducks, in the farm where bird flu was confirmed and in area within one-kilometre radius of the farm. According to Kottayam District Collector M Anjana, around 10,400 birds have been identified to be culled in the region to ensure the containment of the avian influenza virus. “We have commenced culling activities and we expect to complete the activities in three-four days. As of now, the virus has not been detected from any other place. We are closely watching the situation and the forest department has been directed to keep a tab on migratory birds,” Anjana said.Thomaskutty, a duck farmer of Karuvatta North in Alappuzha, said he had nurtured around 6,000 ducklings and 3,200 of these died due to bird flu. “The remaining ducks were culled by the department officials. Ducks of a majority of the 35 farmers in the region were destroyed by the RRTs. Earlier, the government had proposed a plan to insure the ducks, but it was not implemented. If the ducks were insured, we would have got around `70 per duck that died. We are now facing a huge loss,” he said. The health department has also begun surveillance to check whether any person has been infected with bird flu. “Since Covid-19 spread remains in the region, we are examining all persons who have fever, cough or other symptoms of flu. Strict direction has been given to all primary health centres and health officials in Kuttanad areas to examine all people who have symptoms of flu,” the officer said.Follow The New Indian Express channel on WhatsApp Download the TNIE app to stay with us and follow the latestBird fluAvian fluKottayamAlappuzhaShow CommentsRelated StoriesNo stories found.

File photo: Veterinarians check chickens at a poultry farm.(ASSOCIATED PRESS) The death of birds is spreading at an alarming speed across Rajasthan. Till Tuesday morning, the tally had reached 625 from 16 of 33 districts. The state has sent 86 samples for testing from 11 districts. Agriculture and animal husbandry minister Lal Chand Kataria said the samples sent from three districts are found positive for Avian Influenza. This virus is spreading in other states also and it is a matter of concern, especially amid the Covid-19 pandemic. “The virus has not affected chickens or eggs yet but all precautions are being taken, looking at the way it has spread among crows. But the positive news is that the samples from Jodhpur have come out negative. Samples from Jhalawar, Kota and Baran have come positive,”he said. Also read: Budget Session likely from January 29, Union Budget on February 1 The minister said the area where the flu is found will be sanitised as done for Covid-19. “There will be no ban on the sale of eggs as no impact of flu is found on poultry. Looking to possibilities, awareness is created in advance among the poultry owners and people,” he said. Kataria said the issue is that the state doesn’t have a laboratory to conduct tests and the samples are sent outside. “We want to establish a lab to avoid any delay and have spoken to the government,” he added. Department principal secretary Kunji Lal Meena said only the laboratory in Bhopal is accredited by the government to conduct tests for such diseases. The government has agreed in-principal to encourage regional labs – a proposal to setup one in Jaipur will be sent today. The state has the expertise to run such labs. On the type of flu variant found in state, department secretary Arushi Malik said it is found to be Avian Influenza subtype H5N8, which is not dangerous for people but precautions need to be taken.

Samples have been collected from Hastsal and Dwarka's Sector 9 in south-west Delhi and Mayur Vihar Phase-III in east Delhi by the animal husbandry department, said officials. Crows found dead at an MCD park in Mayur Vihar Phase 3 on Friday NEW DELHI: Amidst a bird flu scare in some parts of the country, Delhi has reported over 35 bird deaths in the past 72 hours. Samples have been collected from Hastsal and Dwarka's Sector 9 in south-west Delhi and Mayur Vihar Phase-III in east Delhi by the animal husbandry department, said officials. The Hastsal samples have been sent to the Northern Regional Disease Diagnostic Laboratory in Jalandhar while the rest have been sent to the High Security Animal Disease Laboratory in Bhopal for testing for avian influenza.The first results are expected by Monday.When bird flu forced closure of Delhi zoo for 3 months in 2016East corporation sources, however, claimed an unusually large number of deaths at the Mayur Vihar Park â over 100 â but there was no official confirmation. The staff at the park told reporters that they had been regularly burying carcasses of crows for the past few days.The H5N8 strain of the avian influenza â- a subtype of the H5N1 avian influenza -- has been reported in India over the past two weeks with six states, including Kerala, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana and Gujarat, confirming the presence of the flu.An animal husbandry official said around 16 wild birds were found dead in Hastsal on Wednesday. Late on Thursday evening, residents of Mayur Vihar Phase-III contacted the department to report that a large number of crows had been found dead at a local park. âThe samples from Hastsal were collected on Wednesday. On Thursday, we received a call late in the evening from Mayur Vihar and found 17 crows lying dead. Samples from the carcasses were collected on Friday morning. Two crows were found dead on Friday at Dwarkaâs Sector-9,â added the official.After the samples had been collected at the Mayur Vihar Phase-III park, all the remaining carcasses were disposed of by deep burial adopting bio security measures and the area was sanitized. Instructions were also given to the attendants at the park to report any further mortality of birds.While bird flu primarily affects domestic poultry, it can spread from infected birds to other winged creatures through contact with nasal and respiratory secretions and also due to contamination of feed and water.âThe results of the Hastsal samples are likely to be received by Monday. It could take even longer owing to the increased rush at the centre as samples from other states are also arriving. Results from the Mayur Vihar site and Dwarka could be out by Wednesday,â said Rakesh Kumar, director, animal husbandry department.Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia had said on Thursday there were no cases so far in Delhi, and asked officials to maintain a strict vigil on birds at major poultry markets, water bodies, zoo and other potential hotspots. These include the Ghazipur fish and poultry market, Shakti Sthal Lake, Sanjay Lake, Bhalswa Lake and smaller water bodies in DDA parks. Eleven rapid response teams have been set up to monitor the hotspots.The same strain of the influenza had struck Delhi zoo in 2016. The zoo was closed for nearly three months after several birds, including the migratory ones, were found dead inside the zoo. Zoo officials say disinfectants such as sodium hypochlorite, virkon and lime powder are being sprayed across the zoo two times a day as a preventive measure.Kamal Preet, chief wildlife warden, forest and wildlife department of Delhi, said they had carried out field inspections on Friday to check spots where migratory birds descend. âNo birds were found dead. If we spot any, we will be sending samples to the animal husbandry department. The birds will be handled wearing special suits and the standard operating procedure has been circulated among the ground staff,â she said.End of ArticleFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA Visual Stories Previous9 easy-to-do yoga poses that improve memory and intelligenceLifestyleHow to make South Indian-style Rava Masala Dosa at homeFood10 baby girl names that mean 'beauty'Lifestyle10 most stylish sarees of Janhvi KapoorLifestyle10 baby boy names that mean "gift from god"Lifestyle10 Indiaâs most visited natural destinationstravel10 places in the hills to visit in November before it gets too coldtravelHow to use Turmeric (Haldi) for weight lossLifestyle8 life lessons that humans can learn from animalsLifestyle8 foods that Ratan Tata loved the mostFood Next123 Photostories 5 dry fruits that help reduce uric acid levels naturallyWalnut vs. almonds: Which is healthier and how much to consume?Bigg Boss 18: Confirmed list of the contestants of Salman Khan hosted controversial showFrom 91 kg to 76 kg; Laughter Chefs fame Bharti Singh's inspiring weight loss journeyFrom earning Rs 500 per month to making it to the Forbes list, having a net worth of approximately Rs 300 crores and more: Rags to riches story of Kapil SharmaFrom a lavish 8 BHK to high-end car collection, a net worth approximately Rs 130 crore and more; Luxurious life of Ankita Lokhande's hubby Vicky JainFrom Karisma Kapoor calling sister Bebo âjeans chorâ to Kareena Kapoor Khan saying son Jeh is âtoofanâ; Moments from The Great Indian Kapil Show5 countries with the best anti-aircraft missile systems in the world8 animals that help Earth heal and howExclusive: Bhavya Gandhi on playing Prabhas in Pushpa Impossible: I had never imagined myself in a negative roleHow tall are Trump family membersâCommon mistakes why magnesium supplements do not workâ123Hot PicksSukha ArrestNayab Singh Saini OathIndia Canada NewsUS Election Timeline 2024Supermoon TonightLawrence Bishnoi Hit ListStock Market TodayTOP TRENDINGTaylor SwiftRam Kumar Mishra MurderMaharashtra Election ScheduleUGC NET June Result 2024Bahraich ViolenceDiddy ListMeghan MarkleAPJ Abdul Kalam Motivational QuotesRBI Summer InternshipNoel TataTrending StoriesIn CityEntire WebsiteRam Gopal Mishra murder: 5 accused arrested after encounter in BahraichHamas chief Yahya Sinwar dead?

The samples were tested at Bopal-based ICAR-National Institute of High-Security Animal Diseases (ICAR-NIHSAD).Gujarat has been placed under high alert state following the confirmation. The state has issued orders for the closure of four bird sanctuaries, two of which are based in Ahmedabad, and one each in Porbandar and Jamnagar. However, State's Animal Husbandry minister Kunvarji Bavalia stated that bird flu in the state was limited to migratory birds and that so far there had been no confirmed cases in poultry birds.Meanwhile, Haryana's Animal Husbandry and Dairying Minister Jai Prakash Daral has said that the birds within one-km radius of Kheri and Ghanauli villages in Panchkula would be culled.

The bird flu (Avian Influenza) caused by the virus H5N1 is contagious and fatal. In March 2020, the death of dozens of crows due to Bird Flu was reported from various parts of Bihar, which sparked fear among the residents amid the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. In 2006, the death of chickens due to this flu was reported from Maharashtra. Principal secretary, Animal Husbandry, Kunji Lal Meena said deaths due to this virus are mainly reported among crows and majority of cases have been reported from Kota and Jodhpur division. “The flu is dangerous and guidelines have been issued. All the field officers and others have been asked to be vigilant. The poultry farm owners are asked to be more vigilant and effective monitoring is being ensured at all sites, especially at wetlands, Sambhar Lake and Kaila Devi bird sanctuary,” said Meena.

Till date, the death of 100 crows is reported from Jhalawar, 72 from Baran, 47 from Kota, 19 in Pali and seven each from Jodhpur and Jaipur. Department secretary, Arushi Malik said the government of India’s guidelines for containment of Bird Flu are being followed and an alert has been sounded in all districts. Department additional director, Bhawani Rathore said, “The situation is not alarming but we are vigilant, ensuring that this virus does not enter domestic animals. The guidelines are followed and dead animals are buried.” He said that over 75 samples have been sent from various places for testing. Chief wildlife warden, ML Meena, said the department has sounded an alert and field staff is asked to be more vigilant.

Thank you for reading Nation.Africa Show plans One of the major problems poultry farmers face is bird flu (Avian Influenza or HPAI H5). This is a viral disease that affects wild birds, captive wild birds and domestic poultry (including backyard chickens, according to Dr Samuel Nsubuga, a veterinary doctor affiliated to Smart Agribusiness Forum Africa. Bird flu if not attended to immediately can sweep the whole farm. However, there are two forms of avian influenza, that is low pathogenicity (LPAI) and high pathogenicity (HPAI). Of the two, the most common one is low pathogenicity avian influenza. Nsubuga says it is mostly harmless and the infected chickens will react with general flu/cold-like symptoms. On the other hand, highly pathogenicity avian influenza is extremely contagious and kills approximately 90 per cent of all birds that catch the disease. How it is spreadAccording to the veterinary doctor, birds contract the virus via contact with nasal secretions or faeces from an infected bird. The virus can also spread through poor ventilation in the poultry house, lack of knowledge about bird management, wild birds that enter bird houses, unclean houses and from clothing of people who visit the bird houses as well as sharing of equipment and shelter between infected and non-infected birds. SymptomsThere are different ways bird flu can present itself, according Nsubuga. It however, calls for farmers to always be keen, so as to take immediate action. Birds and poultry with bird flu may exhibit respiratory symptoms such as coughing and wheezing. There may also be nasal discharge, in some cases tinged with blood, according to the vet.Birds with avian influenza often behave differently from before they became infected. For example, they may seem depressed or be inactive. They tend to eat and drink less than normally. The expert adds that the birds may also suddenly become unable to stand or walk normally.If they have started laying eggs the time they get infected, the birds often produce fewer eggs than before. In addition, the egg shells also tend to be too soft or shapeless. Also Read Of Saints and their Day Life 15 hours ago Conversation for the Socially Impaired Life 16 hours ago Physical signsAmong the physical signs, ,Nsubuga says, a farmer has to take note of are; ruffling of the feathers, the colour of the combs and waddles on the birds turning to bluish-purple and the combs, waddles, hocks, eyelids and head will get swollen.Diarrhoea may develop in some birds with avian influenza as well as sudden death without any signs. TreatmentAlthough the virus is very contagious, Nsubuga says it can be treated as long as the farmer identifies the situation quickly. The treatment for the virus include antiviral medication. However, he advises that the treatment be carried out by a professional veterinary personnel.“Farmers should avoid trials and testing of treatment doses they are not sure of, as these can result in killing of birds or even misuse of drugs and vaccines,” he cautions.Dr Nsubuga says there are helpful herbs a farmer can apply as treatment.Aloevera, which is locally known as kigaji. is applied by chopping the leaves into pieces and putting them in drinking water. Red pepper is also used by crushing the friuts and infusing into drinking water. This concoction targets their breath problems and respiratory symptoms. However, some of the control measures which Dr Nsubuga suggests include; Vaccinating uninfected birds to render the virus harmless. Vaccination also improves immunity and body defence towards influenza virus. But in this case, a farmer has to vaccinate the birds before cases break out.Separation of the infected birds from the healthy ones is also useful, according to Dr Nsubuga. “But what you should know is that once a chicken catches highly pathogenicity avian influenza, it will be dead within an hour,” he cautions.

Odisha continues to be on tenterhooks with the threat of bird flu looming large as record numbers of migratory birds have thronged its water-bodies, famous for housing them during winter season. In Govindpur village in Khordha District, around 120 poultry birds were found dead. A State-level special supervisory team along with the district-level rapid response teams rushed to the spot and took stock of the situation. Samples of five of the dead birds, which were taken to the Animal Diseases Research Institute (ADRI) for laboratory investigation, tested negative for avian influenza virus based on the avian influenza virus antigen test. Others were disposed of in deep burial method with proper disinfection measures. The Chilika Lake, largest wintering ground of the winged guests in the Indian sub-continent, had a record congregation of over 11,42,000 birds belonging to 190 species. In the Bhitarkanika National Park, a congregation of 1.36 lakh migratory birds was estimated. It was 15% higher than last year’s estimation. Good concentrations of migratory birds were also reported in the Anshupa Lake and the Hirakud Dam. Carriers of avian influenza “Migratory birds are the carriers of avian influenza and it spreads through faecal droppings, shared feed and drinking water of the birds. For active surveillance and monitoring of birds, for any sign of suspected avian influenza, district Collectors, chief district veterinary officers and divisional forest officers have been asked to take all possible steps and appropriate measures for controlling it, on priority,” the State government said here on Thursday. Keeping this in view, the State government is vigilant and is continuously observing any unnatural deaths and behaviour of birds. The government said regular surveillance measures were being taken up through collection of tracheal swabs, cloaca swabs, environmental samples and serum samples by field veterinarians. “Until now around 11,000 samples have been collected and tested during the migratory season. So far all samples have tested negative for avian influenza,” it said.

As a Bhopal-based laboratory confirmed that 437,000 poultry birds in Haryana died because of bird flu, the Centre on Friday asked the six states where deaths because of the disease have been confirmed to increase their vigil and act to curb the outbreak. An Indian wildlife department doctor collects a swab sample from a duck for bird flu test at Manda park in Jammu, (AP) The Centre has confirmed bird flu in Kerala, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Gujarat and Haryana, the government said in a statement. “So far, the disease has been confirmed from six states. It is learnt that culling operations have been completed in both the affected districts of Kerala. The disinfection process is underway,” the statement read. Following the confirmation of bird flu, Haryana is set to start the biggest culling of birds in any state. Officials said 166,000 birds would be killed in the next few days. Culling of birds is to take place within 1 km of Kheri and Ghanauli villages from where samples tested positive for bird flu, they said. Two of the three samples sent by the Haryana animal husbandry department from poultry farms in Panchkula’s Barwala belt to the National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD) laboratory in Bhopal tested positive for avian influenza on Friday. “As per the report received, it has been confirmed that birds of two poultry farms were infected with avian influenza (H5N8). Though this bird flu strain is less pathogenic, the state government has issued a notification for the affected poultry farms of Panchkula as a precautionary measure,” Haryana’s animal husbandry and dairying minister JP Dalal said on Friday. Tests done on three batches of samples sent to a Jalandhar lab from Barwala were inconclusive, following which the samples were sent to the Bhopal lab. More than 437,000 poultry birds have died in Panchkula’s Barwala and Raipur Rani areas, considered to be Asia’s second largest poultry belt, over the past 26 days. On Friday, the central team visited the community health centre in both areas. Arrangements have been made at the community health centre in Raipur Rani, and isolation wards set up, while Tamiflu tablets have been procured to check human-to-human transmission of the influenza, said Dr Saroj Aggarwal, deputy civil surgeon, Panchkula. “We are ready to deal with any situation.” The Haryana government on Friday declared an area within a radius of 1 km from the two poultry farms where poultry birds have been tested for the flu as an “infected zone” and the area within a radius of up to 10 km as a “surveillance zone”. The state government has restricted the movement of poultry goods from these areas. At least 166,000 poultry birds of five poultry farms, which fall within a 1-km radius of the two infected farms, will be culled and the state government will give ₹90 per bird as compensation to the owners. To prevent the spread, check posts have been set up in the infected areas, officials said. Concerns of the spread of flu were also reported from Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Jammu and Kashmir, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Jharkhand and Bihar, where bird deaths were reported. Samples from all these states have been sent to the central laboratory in Bhopal. In the states where bird flu has been confirmed, its spread is increasing. In Rajasthan, deaths of birds, mostly crows, because of bird flu were reported from 30 of 33 districts. On Wednesday, deaths were reported from 12 districts. In Madhya Pradesh, over 800 birds died in 20 of 52 districts, an increase of 12 in the past two days. In Maharashtra, suspected flu deaths were reported from three more districts, taking the number of affected districts to eight. Close to 350 birds have died so far. The preliminary results of samples tested in Pune were negative, but final confirmation will come from the Bhopal lab. “Any confirmation of bird flu is to be done only by NIHSAD,” said Anoop Kumar, principal secretary at the state animal husbandry department. Bird flu is under control in Kerala, another major hot spot, where about 28,000 birds have died and another 70,000 been culled, mostly in Alapzuha and Kottayam, said Kerala animal husbandry minister K Raju.

Unusual mortality of 16 birds has also been reported at DDA park Hastsal Village in the national capital, and samples have been sent to a testing lab. ”So far, the disease has been confirmed from six states (Kerala, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana and Gujarat). ”It is learnt that culling operations have been completed in both the affected districts of Kerala. The disinfection process is underway,” according to an official statement. States that are still unaffected by Avian Influenza (AI) have been requested to keep a vigil on any unusual mortality among birds and to report immediately so that necessary measures are taken in the fastest possible time, it added. Central teams have been deployed to visit the affected states of Kerala, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh for monitoring and for epidemiological investigation. The government said that in Haryana, there has been confirmation of Avian Influenza positive samples from ICAR-NIHSAD in poultry (two poultry farms) of the Panchkula district. Positive samples have also been reported in migratory birds in the Junagadh district, Gujarat, and in crows in Sawai Madhopur, Pali, Jaisalmer and Mohar districts of Rajasthan. Therefore, the Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying has suggested the affected states to contain the disease as per the Action Plan on Avian Influenza. Over 1.60 lakh birds of five poultry farms in Haryana’s Panchkula district are set to be culled as some poultry samples there have tested positive for the avian flu, Agriculture minister J P Dalal said on Friday. The employees of these poultry farms too would be examined by the health department, Dalal further said, adding they would also be given anti-viral medicines. Notably, over four lakh poultry birds died at some farms in Haryana’s Panchkula district over the past several days. Fresh cases of birds death were reported in parts of Rajasthan, taking the tally to 2,166. The avian influenza subtype H5N8 has been detected in 11 districts of the state, including state capital. As per Animal Husbandry Department, 329 deaths of birds, including 223 crows, 11 peacocks, 55 pigeons and 40 others were reported in the state today. Around 50 birds, mostly crows, have died in the national capital over the last three to four days amid a bird flu scare, officials said. We received information about the death of crows in Dwarka and Mayur Vihar Phase 3 and of a few wild birds in Hastsal in West Delhi. However, it is yet to be ascertained if bird flu infection is the reason, Dr. Rakesh Singh from the animal husbandry unit of the Development Department said. Around 50 birds have died in these areas over the last three to four days, he said. Amid a bird flue scare, shops selling poultry meat in the national capital have recorded have recorded 20-25 per cent dip in sales of chicken over the last few weeks. Four crows were found dead in Chhattisgarh’s Balod district, officials said. Samples of three of them were sent for laboratory testing to ascertain the cause of death, they said. The district administration has alerted people associated with backyard and commercial poultry to report immediately to the nearest veterinary centre if they witness unexplained death in birds, the officials said. The death of four crows was reported from Pondi village, located around 13 km away from Balod town, in the last two days, Collector Janmejay Mahobe said. The cause of their deaths was not immediately known and their samples have been sent to the National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD), Bhopal, for testing to check if they died due to bird flu, he said. Himachal Pradesh Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur said the state government is fully alert to deal with bird flu and there is monitoring of the areas around Pog Dam where over 3,400 birds have died so far. He chaired a review meeting for bird flu preparedness and said that the district administration, animal husbandry and wildlife departments should work to prevent the spread its spread. ”So far, 3,410 migratory birds have died due to bird flu in Pong Dam area of Kangra district and these birds are being buried with full protocol so that there is no risk of infection at any stage,” he said. The chief minister said 65 teams of the Animal Husbandry Department and the Wildlife Department are monitoring the areas around Pong Dam. Gujarat recorded its first confirmed cases of bird flu infection after samples of two dead birds from Junagadh district tested positive, an official said. The two birds, lapwings, had been rescued on January 3 from an area near Kharo Dam in Manavadar tehsil of the district, but they later died due to illness, said Dr D D Panera, Deputy Director, Animal Husbandry division, Junagadh. The Punjab government banned import of poultry birds from other states with immediate effect till January 15.Continue ReadingFirst Published: Jan 8, 2021 10:43 PM ISTCheck out our in-depth Market Coverage, Business News & get real-time Stock Market Updates on CNBC-TV18.

Cases have also been reported from Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana & Kerala. Taran Deol 05 January, 2021 03:52 pm IST FacebookTwitterWhatsAppLinkedin Representational Image of a poultry farm | Wikipedia Commons Follow Us : Text Size: A- A+ New Delhi: Himachal Pradesh became the fifth Indian state — after Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana and Kerala — to confirm cases of avian flu after 1,800 migratory birds were found dead in the state’s Pong Dam Lake in the Kangra district. “Slaughtering, sale, purchase and export of any poultry, birds, fish of any breed and their related products, including eggs, meat, chicken” has been prohibited in the district’s subdivisions of Fatehpur, Dehra, Jawali and Indora. Shops selling these products in the four subdivisions will also remain closed. Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Wildlife) Archana Sharma said, “The laboratory at the Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI) in Bareilly had detected avian influenza in the samples of dead birds, according to information conveyed to us by the Centre Monday. We were awaiting confirmation by NIHSAD as it is the nodal body for detecting this disease.” Show Full Article “The dead birds are being disposed off as per bird-flu protocol, adding that no such deaths have been reported so far from other water bodies in the state,” Hindustan Times quoted officials as saying. A rapid response team has been formed to deal with the outbreak, according to the director of animal husbandry, Dr Ajmer Dogra. As of 4 January, Rajasthan has reported 425 bird deaths, all of which were traced back to the Jhalawar district, according to the state’s animal husbandry department. Meanwhile, Kerala has ordered the culling of nearly 40,000 birds within a one kilometer radius of the infected areas of Kottayam — which has seen 1,500 bird deaths — and Alappuzha districts. Last week, the bird flu virus was detected in 50 crows carcasses in Indore as well. In Haryana’s Barwala, around one lakh poultry birds reportedly died of the flu. Alongside the Covid-19 outbreak this year, there have been bird flu outbreaks in Egypt, the United Kingdom (UK), South Korea, Japan and Vietnam. What is bird flu First discovered in China in 1997, bird flu, also known as avian flu, “is a highly infectious and severe respiratory disease in birds caused by the H5N1 influenza virus, which can occasionally infect humans as well, although human-to-human transmission is unusual” and does not happen easily. People can get infected by the naturally occurring virus in birds only upon close interaction with “infected live or dead birds, or H5N1-contaminated environments” through touching infected birds, their droppings, bedding or killing and preparing infected poultry for cooking. Markets where live birds are sold can also be another source, the UK’s National Health Services notes. If infected, the mortality rate in humans stands at 60 per cent, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Consumption of poultry products and other wild game is safe as long as it is cooked thoroughly. “Normal temperatures used for cooking (so that food reaches 70°C in all parts) will kill the virus,” the WHO notes. Majority of human infections can be traced back to slaughtering and handling of infected birds at home. Besides its high mortality rate, if the H1N5 virus were to change genetically — something that occurs often in influenza viruses — such that it becomes more contagious and retains its “capacity to cause severe disease, the consequences for public health could be very serious.” Symptoms, treatment, vaccine Bird flu symptoms in humans include “fever, malaise, cough, sore throat, and muscle aches” as well as other early symptoms including abdominal pain, chest pain and diarrhoea. If the infection progresses quickly, severe respiratory illnesses and neurological changes can also occur. If infected, humans tend to fall severely ill and require hospitalisation where oseltamivir — an antiviral medicine — is used widely to prevent severity of the disease and death. Multiple vaccines have been developed for the H5N1 influenza virus and have been stockpiled in case of an emergency. Many other vaccine candidates are under development as well, in case the virus mutates and creates a pandemic. Several countries have been vaccinating the birds against the disease. To prevent bird flu, one must wash hands with warm water and soap “especially before and after handling food, in particular raw poultry,” avoid contact with live birds and poultry, and use different utensils for cooked and raw meat. The first outbreak of H5N1 in India was recorded 15 years ago in February 2006 at a poultry industry in the Maharashtra’s Nandurbar district. There was a major outbreak in West Bengal in 2008 and another one in Kerala in 2014. Globally, 862 cases of bird flu have been recorded from 17 countries between January 2003 and December 2020, of which 455 were fatal, according to the WHO.

However, the confirmation of bird flu in Delhi, Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra, is awaited as the samples have been sent for testing, it said. Besides Uttar Pradesh, the other six states where bird flu is confirmed are Kerala, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana and Gujarat. "So far, the disease has been confirmed from seven states. ...The Department has issued advisory to the affected states so as to avoid further spread of the disease," the Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying said in a statement. In Chhattisgarh, reports of unusual mortality of birds in poultry and wild birds in Balod district were reported on Friday night and Saturday morning. The samples have been sent to the labs concerned. In Delhi, reports of unusual mortality in ducks were received from Sanjay lake and the samples have been sent for testing, it said. Similarly in Maharashtra, the samples of dead crows from Mumbai, Thane, Dapoli, Parbhani and Beed districts have been sent to Bhopal-based ICAR-National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases (ICAR-NIHSAD), it added. "After confirmation of Avian Influenza positive samples from ICAR-NIHSAD in poultry (two poultry farms) of Panchkula district, Haryana, positive cases of Avian Influenza in migratory birds were reported in Shivpuri, Rajgarh, Shajapur, Agar, Vidisha district of Madhya Pradesh, Zoological Park, Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh and Pratapgarh and Dausa districts of Rajasthan," the ministry said. On the status of culling operation, the ministry said it has been completed in two affected districts of Kerala. Central teams have reached Kerala, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh for monitoring/ epidemiological investigation. The Centre has also asked state governments to ensure effective communication and coordination with health authorities for close vigilance on the outbreak and to avoid any chances of spreading of the disease to humans. States have been asked to increase surveillance around water bodies, live bird markets, zoos and poultry farms and also to ensure proper disposal of carcass, and strengthening of bio-security in poultry farms. They have also been asked to be prepared for any eventuality of avian influenza and ensure sufficient stock of PPE kits and accessories required for culling operations. "Chief Secretaries/Administrators were requested to arrange to issue appropriate advisories to quell consumer reactions, affected by rumours and increase awareness regarding safety of poultry or poultry products that are safe for consumption following boiling/ cooking procedures," the statement added. Meanwhile, the anxiety over spread of the disease has hit the poultry industry as prices of eggs and broiler chicken have fallen owing to decline in demand.

Most forms of the virus are restricted to birds.It is a highly contagious viral disease affecting several species of food-producing birds (chickens, turkeys, quails, guinea fowl, etc.), as well as pet birds and wild birds.Occasionally mammals, including humans, may contract avian influenza.Influenza A viruses are classified into subtypes based on two surface proteins, Hemagglutinin (HA) and Neuraminidase (NA).Influenza A(H5N8) virus:According to Paris-based World Organisation for Animal Health, H5N8 avian influenza is a disease of birds, caused by Type “A” influenza viruses, which can affect several species of domestic poultry, such as chickens, turkeys, quails, guinea fowl, ducks, as well as pet birds, wild migratory birds and water fowl.Can the virus transfer to humans?There are no known cases of H5N8 in human beings. Risk to general public is very low. There is also no evidence that consumption of poultry meat or eggs could transmit the virus to humans. But necessary precautions are required while handling sick/dead birds and contaminated material during control and containment operations. It is considered safe to eat properly cooked poultry products.Control measures:Culling is usually undertaken to control the infection when it is detected in animals. Besides culling, safe disposal of all such culled animals and animal products is also important. The authorities also need to strictly enforce decontamination of infected premises and undertake quarantine of contaminated vehicles and personnel.InstaLinks:Prelims Link:When a country is declared free from Avian Influenza, who declares it?H5N1 vs H5N6 vs H9N2 vs H5N8.Mains Link:Write a note on Bird Flu.

Use different utensils for cooking raw meat and make sure meat is cooked properly until steaming hot. Avoid direct contact with live and poultry birds,” Dr Nanda advised. IANS | New Delhi | January 6, 2021 9:56 am (Representational Image: iStock) Several states from North, West and South India are witnessing a sporadic rise in the cases of Avian Influenza (bird flu). States like Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Kerala have reported close to 25,000 deaths predominantly of ducks, crows and migratory birds. The news has started to trigger panic among the public. The people, still fear-struck with the Covid-19 infection, are afraid that the bird flu, which is also a viral disease, may turn into an epidemic. However, the health experts have negated such a possibility and advised the public to take precaution and not panic. The doctors said that the risk of human-to-human transmission of the H5N1 virus that causes the bird flu is very rare unless one works in proximity with the infected species of birds. Advertisement “People who work closely with poultry are at high risk of getting the infection. Otherwise, human to human transmission of the H5N1 virus is very rare. Hence there is no need to panic,” Dr. Harshal R. Salve, Associate Professor at Centre for Community Medicine, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) told IANS. “The bird flu is detected in sick birds and has the possibility to spread among humans only with those handling poultry or infected birds,” said Dr. Rajeev Gupta, Director- Internal Medicine, Max Super Speciality Hospital, Shalimar Bagh (Delhi). Dr. Upali Nanda, Head, Preventive Health & Consultant-Medicine, Medeor Hospital Qutab Institutional Area (Delhi), also said that human-to-human transmission of the Avian Influenza is very unusual. Meanwhile, the public has started to ditch eggs and chicken meat in fear that it might carry the H5N1 virus and could infect the ones who would consume it. While there is no connection between the spread of Avian Influenza and consumption of eggs, the doctors suggested ditching undercooked poultry products and meat for a while to allay the fear. “There is no evidence available that suggests the spread of bird flu through eating meat or eggs. Nonetheless, eating raw meat and eggs should be avoided in the affected region till the incidents come down,” advised Dr. Salve. He goes on to add that the public should not let their guards down and continue to follow the safe and hygienic practices adopted amid the pandemic to steer clear from any possibility of encountering the H5N1 virus. Dr. Nanda said that it is anyway not advised to eat semi-cooked meat and eggs. “People can also take extra precaution besides properly cooking the meat and poultry,” she added. “Wash your hands with warm water and soap, especially before and after handling the raw poultry and eggs. Use different utensils for cooking raw meat and make sure meat is cooked properly until steaming hot. Avoid direct contact with live and poultry birds,” Dr Nanda advised. She also suggested avoiding visiting live animal markets or poultry farms for now. “If need be, wear a mask and gloves all the time. Also, do not go near or touch bird droppings or sick and dead birds,” Dr. Nanda added. The bird flu is not yet detected in the poultry birds. The National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases, where samples of animals sent across India for detection of diseases, told IANS that it has not found the presence of the H5N1 virus in the poultry birds yet. The president of Ghazipur Mandi, biggest poultry market in the national capital, also informed IANS that no incidence of the bird flu among chicken meat has been reported in the market as yet.

South Korea investigating new suspected case of highly contagious bird flu 04 Jan 2021 Created: 08:47 AM Last Updated: 08:47 AM Views: 530 Seoul, Jan. 4 (BNA): South Korea's agricultural ministry said Monday it is looking into yet another suspected case of highly pathogenic bird flu linked to farms amid the prolonged fight against the disease. The latest suspected case of a highly contagious H5N8 strain of bird flu was reported from an egg farm in Cheonan, 92 kilometers south of Seoul, late Sunday, according to the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, South Korean News Agency (Yonhap) reported. After reporting the first case at a farm in nearly three years in November 2020, the country has since identified 42 infections. By region, Gyeonggi Province that surrounds Seoul accounted for 12 cases, followed by South Jeolla Province with 10. North Jeolla Province also took up nine infections. The number of poultry destroyed by local authorities reached 12.6 million as of Monday. Birds within a 3-kilometer radius of infected farms are culled under the local quarantine law. South Korea has been suffering from a series of avian influenza cases from wild birds since October. So far, 49 cases have been reported from their habitats. Twelve other suspected cases are also under investigation. Local authorities are vigilant as migratory birds are expected to continue fly into the country throughout this month, which may spread the disease to more poultry farms. F.K.N.

Vehicles entering Tamil Nadu from Kerala were closely monitored from Tuesday morning COIMBATORE/MADURAI: The state animal husbandry department has increased vigil at checkposts at the Tamil NaduâKerala interstate borders and poultry farms in Namakkal following the outbreak of bird flu in Kerala.Vehicles entering Tamil Nadu from Kerala were closely monitored from Tuesday morning in border checkposts in Coimbatore, Tirupur, Nilgiris, Kanyakumari, Tirunelveli and Theni districts.While vehicles carrying poultry were prohibited entry, other vehicles from Kerala were allowed only after fumigation. "We are checking the vehicles entering into Coimbatore from Kerala at 12 locations including Walayar, Velanthavalam, Meenakshipuram and Gopalpuram. Personnel from police department, revenue department, animal husbandry department and forest department have been deployed in each checkpost," joint director (JD) of animal husbandry department in Coimbatore Dr Perumalsamy said. While chicken is sent in large quantities from TN to Kerala, the neighbouring state sends ducks here. "We have intensified screening at all districts bordering Kerala," health secretary J Radhakrishnan said here on Tuesday. "Multiple departments are working together to prevent human transmission of the virus," he told reporters in Chennai.Bird flu has been confirmed in Allepey and Kottayam districts of Kerala and the government authorities of the neighbouring state have declared it as a state-specific disaster and issued a high alert. Similar outbreaks have been reported from Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh, worrying the poultry farmers in Namakkal, the egg and chicken production hub. "We are spraying disinfectants on all vehicles coming from other states," P V Senthil, an egg exporter in Namakkal, said. Similarly, vehicles going out from the farms also were fumigated. Precautions have also been put in place for workers in poultry farms. "The workers should soak their foot in the disinfectant liquid while entering the farm and have to use hand gloves, face masks and aprons during their working hours," Senthil said.In Kanyakumari, another key entry point from Kerala, teams comprising a veterinarian, a livestock inspector, attender and two assistants to spray chlorine dioxide disinfectants were stationed at the checkposts. Animal Husbandry officials said that they would continue the exercise for 90 days and shall extend it further if needed.The officials are coordinating with the forest department to check if migratory birds visiting places such as Kariyamanikapuram near Suchindram in Kanyakumari are infected. At the Puliyarai checkpost in Tenkasi district, vehicles returning after unloading chicken in Kerala were disinfected. "We have been instructed not to take pending stock of unsold birds from Kerala or ducks brought from Kerala for sale in or through Tamil Nadu," veterinarian A Jayapalraj said.In Theni district, vehicles carrying vegetables are being properly disinfected when they return empty after unloading in Kerala. Camps have been set up at Cumbummettu and Bodimettu checkposts to monitor vehicles entering Tamil Nadu. Staff members at the AHD dispensaries and clinics have been asked to stay alert if farmers reported mass illness or deaths of birds in the bordering district.Explaining that the flu â H5N8 (Avian influenza) - is commonly found in migratory birds, an animal husbandry official said that they are monitoring water bodies where migratory birds flock. "We are also closely watching the backyard poultry farms in villages," he added. The officials have been collecting 200 samples â blood or droppings in case of domestic birds and droppings in case of migratory birds - every month and send it to a testing laboratory in Erode to ensure that birds are not affected by any virus.End of ArticleFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA Visual Stories Previous10 reasons to have 1 pomegranate dailyLifestyleScenic hill station train journeys in North IndiatravelIndiaâs famous tigers and tigresses: The legends of the wildtravelTips for guiding your child to greater happinessLifestyleHow to make South Indian-Style Mysore Masala Dosa at homeFood'Stree 2, 'Aashiqui' and other films of Shraddha Kapoor to watchEntertainmentAI imagines how India's top metros will look like in the next 50 yearsLifestyle15 Indian states and the rice dishes they are famous forFoodHow to extract, store, and apply fresh Aloe Vera to aid hair growthLifestyle8 hybrid animals that were âinventedâ by humansLifestyle Next123Hot PicksJK Assembly elections 2024 LiveHarvest Moon Lunar EclipsePuducherry BandhLebanon Pagers ExplosionIsrael MossadNew Mini MoonIAS Tina DabiTOP TRENDINGHamster Kombat Daily Cipher CodesDelta AirlinesBarron TrumpSakshi MalikChampions Trophy FinalIndigo Flight Tail StrikeNEET UG Admission CriteriaHaryana Election 2024Lunar EclipseGangster KakkathopeTrending StoriesIn CityEntire WebsiteSeveral people feared trapped after house collapses in Delhi's Karol Bagh'Putting an end to all the masala': Virat Kohli and Gautam Gambhir leave fans stumpedMassive tech layoffs at Apple, Dell, IBM are a wake-up call for IT professionals: Why upskilling is the key to survival'Biggest security breach': 1000s of pagers explode across Lebanon, many Hezbollah fighters hurt; 9 deadMaharashtra schools closed on Sep 18: Hereâs whySchools to be closed tomorrow in these states: Hereâs why'Prophet Muhammad who taught us to...': Pakistan batter Babar Azam turns to faith amid poor formSukanya Samriddhi Yojana: What are the latest guidelines for SSY accounts?
