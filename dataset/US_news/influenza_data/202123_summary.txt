Vaccine Efficacy for the Elderly: A study evaluated the effectiveness of a single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) as an adjuvant to enhance the efficacy of inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) in elderly mouse models. The study found that immunization with the ssRNA adjuvant along with IIV reduced viral titers, pathological and inflammatory scores in the lungs after influenza challenge in aged mice.

Balanced Immune Response: The study showed that the ssRNA adjuvant induced balanced Th1/Th2 responses and increased IgA titers. It also significantly increased the frequency of influenza HA-specific T cells and IFN-γ production, suggesting enhancement of both innate and adaptive immune responses.

Overcoming Immunosenescence: The ssRNA adjuvant was found to upregulate the expression of genes related to the innate and adaptive immune systems, suggesting that it could overcome immunosenescence in aged mice.

Implications for Influenza Vaccine Strategies: The findings indicate that ssRNA is an efficient vaccine adjuvant that boosts cellular and humoral immunity in elderly individuals. This suggests its potential as a novel adjuvant for currently available influenza virus vaccines for the elderly population.
