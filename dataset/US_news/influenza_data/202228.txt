In December 2021, H5N1 HPAI viruses were detected in poultry and a free-living gull in St. John’s, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. Our phylogenetic analysis showed that these viruses were most closely related to HPAI GsGd viruses circulating in northwestern Europe in spring 2021. Our analysis of wild bird migration suggested that these viruses may have been carried across the Atlantic via Iceland, Greenland/Arctic or pelagic routes. The here documented incursion of HPAI GsGd viruses into North America raises concern for further virus spread across the Americas by wild bird migration.

During the first decade of circulation of this lineage, the hemagglutinin (H) genes diversified into multiple genetic clades. GsGd viruses of clade 2.3.4.4 started to dominate outbreaks globally from 2014 onwards with clade 2.3.4.4b currently emerging as a particularly fit virus. The GsGd lineage, and particularly clade 2.3.4.4b, is expanding both its geographical spread and its host range1,2,3,4. Therefore, this lineage of HPAI H5 virus is an increasing threat to the health of poultry, wildlife, and humans worldwide, as well as a growing economic problem for the global poultry sector3,5.In recent years, HPAI GsGd H5 outbreaks have frequently occurred in Europe3,4,5,6,7,8. For the first time in 2005, the virus spread from Asia to Russia, western Europe, Africa and the Middle East, causing high mortality in wild birds and poultry8. This spread was a result of unprecedented long-distance transport of HPAI virus, in which wild migratory ducks, geese and swans were implicated. The last wild bird case for clade 2.2 and derivatives in Europe was detected in Germany in January 20096. Another European incursion of a clade 2.3.2.1 virus occurred in 2009 but was not detected further west than Romania and Bulgaria, after being detected in Qinghai in China and Tyva in Russia7. In 2014/2015 a new intercontinental outbreak of HPAI H5 virus occurred, and since then HPAI H5 viruses have repeatedly caused large outbreaks in wild birds and poultry in Europe5,6. In addition, there are also growing concerns about the zoonotic risks, and in December 2021, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control raised the risk level for virus transmission to occupationally exposed people from ‘low’ to ‘low/moderate’5,9.In December 2021, there was a die-off of domestic birds on an exhibition farm in St. John’s, a city on the Avalon Peninsula of the island of Newfoundland, on the Atlantic coast of Canada. The cause was diagnosed as HPAI H5N1. This was the first report of HPAI H5 in the Americas since June 2015, when the virus spread with wild birds across the Bering Strait to the Pacific coasts of Canada and the USA via the Pacific Flyway, one of the main avian migration routes10. Genetic analysis as reported in the OIE report showed that the hemagglutinin (H) gene corresponded to Eurasian HPAI viruses circulating in spring 202111. This implied that the virus had been carried across the Atlantic, a route that has been recorded before for LPAI viruses but not for any HPAI virus12,13. Therefore, the goal of this study was 1) to investigate in detail whether the HPAI cases in Newfoundland were linked to the recent (2020/2021) or currently ongoing (2021/2022) HPAI outbreaks in Europe, and 2) to indicate the most likely scenario by which the virus crossed the Atlantic with migratory birds.ResultsEpidemiological description of exhibition farm outbreakThe index farm where highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus in captive birds occurred was an exhibition farm in St. John’s, Province of Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. The farm housed 409 birds of different species, namely chickens, guineafowl, peafowl, emus, domestic ducks, domestic geese, and domestic turkeys. On 9th December 2021, the farm owner first noticed mortality. On 13th December, the farm owner reported the increased mortality to a local veterinarian. Autopsies on four chickens showed swollen heads and cutaneous haemorrhages. Oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs from these chickens tested positive for H5 avian influenza virus at the Atlantic Veterinary College, University of Prince Edward Island, and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) was notified. On 16th December, by which time 306 birds (mostly chickens, turkeys and guineafowl) had died, staff of the CFIA collected tissue samples from dead chickens, as well as oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs and sera from different species of captive birds still present (Table 1), after which all remaining captive birds were culled. All oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs tested positive for HPAI virus of the subtype H5N1 by real-time RT-PCR, and all sera tested positive for influenza nucleoprotein antibodies by ELISA. On 20th December, the CFIA confirmed the diagnosis of HPAI of the subtype H5N1.Table 1 List of samples for virological and serological analysis collected by CFIA on 17 December 2021 from different species of captive birds still present at the farm.Full size tableWild birds were frequently observed co-mingling with the captive population. Captive birds except emus were allowed to move freely in and out of the open pens in which they were housed. At an on-site pond, domestic ducks were reported to mingle with free-living mallards (scientific names of wild birds in Table 2), and a snowy egret had been observed around 2nd to 6th December. Other wild birds reported on the farm were common starlings, feral pigeons, and unspecified gulls.Table 2 Common and scientific species names of the birds mentioned in the text.Full size tableRetrospectively, HPAI H5N1 virus also was identified in tissues of a great black-backed gull found at a nearby pond in St. John’s. The gull had been found ill on 26th November 2021 and taken to a local wildlife rehabilitation centre, where it died the following day.Phylogenetic analysisPhylogenetic analyses were performed to compare the genome sequences of the Newfoundland viruses from the exhibition farm birds and a great black-backed gull found nearby to other influenza viruses in the database. Based on BLAST analysis all eight gene segments of the virus had a Eurasian origin, and the virus was identified as a clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 virus. Based on maximum likelihood and time-resolved trees inferred by use of whole genome sequences, the Newfoundland viruses had a shared common ancestor with European viruses circulating in early 2021 (Figs. 1, 2). The dates for the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of all gene segments ranged from December 2019 to April 2021 (Table 3). There was no evidence that the Newfoundland viruses were genetically closely related to other current or recent viruses circulating in Europe. In contrast to currently circulating European viruses, the sequences of the Newfoundland viruses had no evidence of reassortment with other avian influenza viruses after ancestral emergence (Fig. 3). The virus from the great black-backed gull was highly similar to those from the exhibition farm, except for a small number of nucleotide differences in the neuraminidase (N) gene segment.Figure 1Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of the H5 HA gene.

Tips and connecting lines are coloured according to the legend.Full size imageAnalysis of avian migration and potential routes for HPAI H5 virus to be carried across the Atlantic with migrating birdsThere are several pathways for HPAI H5N1 virus to be carried across the Atlantic with migrating birds, based on the multitude of migration routes of wild birds and their overlapping ranges at breeding, stop-over, and wintering sites. Ring-recovery data confirm the regular movements of wild birds from Europe to Iceland and other North Atlantic islands, and from there to North America, and also provide evidence for direct movements of for example seabirds and gulls (Supplementary Table 1). Ringed individuals with a European origin have been found on Newfoundland for 10 of the 24 species in Supplementary Table 1: barnacle goose (1 ringed individual), Eurasian wigeon (5), Eurasian teal (1), great skua (13), European herring gull (1), black-headed gull (1), black-legged kittiwake (102), purple sandpiper (1), Brunnich's guillemot (15), and Atlantic puffin (50). Given that the most likely ancestor of the virus detected in Newfoundland was circulating in Northwest Europe between the beginning of the 2020/2021 outbreak in Europe in October 2020 and April 2021 (see above), likely routes include spring migration of bird species moving to Icelandic, Greenlandic or Canadian High Arctic breeding grounds, or migration directly across the Atlantic Ocean (Fig. 4).Figure 4Maps of transatlantic migration. Putative virus transmission pathways between Europe and Newfoundland via migratory waterfowl/shorebirds (a) and pelagic seabirds (b). Many Icelandic waterfowl and shorebirds (a) winter in Northwest Europe and return to Iceland to breed in spring (1), including whooper swans, greylag geese, pink-footed geese, Eurasian wigeons, Eurasian teals, northern pintails, common ringed plovers and purple sandpipers. Some bird populations use Iceland as a stopover site, and continue to breeding grounds in East Greenland (2; barnacle geese and pink-footed geese), the East Canadian Arctic (3; light-bellied brent geese, red knots, ruddy turnstones) and West Greenland (4; greater white-fronted geese). Migratory birds from Europe share these breeding areas with species that winter in North America, including Canada geese and snow geese from East Greenland and the East Canadian Arctic (5), and some Iceland-breeding species of duck, including small numbers of Eurasian wigeons, Eurasian teals, and tufted ducks (6). Several seabird species (b), such as gulls, skuas, fulmars and auks, have large breeding ranges in the Arctic. After the breeding season many species become fully pelagic and can roam large parts of the northern Atlantic. The mid-Atlantic ridge outside Newfoundland is an important non-breeding area for seabirds, and is frequented by auks from Iceland (7), Svalbard (8) and Norway (9), including large numbers of Atlantic puffins and Brünnich guillemots, and by black-legged kittiwakes and northern fulmars originating from Iceland, Norway and the United Kingdom (7–8, 10). There these birds are joined by seabirds from Canadian and Greenlandic waters (11). Direct migratory links to Newfoundland occurs through greater and lesser-black backed gulls as well as black-headed gulls from Iceland and Greenland (12, 13), and gulls also link the pelagic and the coastal zone around Newfoundland (14). Thickness of the lines highlights the relative approximate population sizes. Dashed lines show where small numbers of individuals, or vagrants, provide a potential pathway. For more details on species and population numbers see Table 2. This figure was prepared using the software R (version 4.0.5, https://www.r-project.org/) and the following packages: -ggplot2 (version 3.3.5, https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/index.html), -sf (version 1.0.5, https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sf/index.html).Full size imageThe first possible route via Iceland seems to be the strongest link between Newfoundland and Europe14,15,16,17, because it is a meeting point of breeding bird populations which winter in Europe as well as along the East coast of North America. Numerous species, totaling almost two million individual birds, migrate annually from northwestern Europe to breeding grounds in Iceland and beyond. Several populations breed on Iceland, including swans (whooper swan) (Supplementary Table 1), geese (greylag goose, pink-footed goose), ducks (Eurasian wigeon, Eurasian teal, Northern pintail), gulls (great- and lesser black-backed gull, black-headed gull, black-legged kittiwake) and shorebirds (common ringed plover, purple sandpiper, Supplementary Table 1). In addition, several species (e.g. barnacle geese and pink-footed geese) migrating to breeding grounds further away (Greenland and/or Canadian High Arctic) make spring and autumn stopovers in Iceland18,19. This creates potential for the virus to have been spread northwards to Iceland (or further northward) in spring, where it could have circulated among breeding birds, or transmitted during autumn migration by species returning from the Arctic. Several Iceland-breeding species of ducks (Eurasian wigeon, Eurasian teal, tufted duck), gulls (lesser black-backed gull, black-legged kittiwake, black-headed gull) and alcids (Brunnich’s guillemot, Atlantic puffin) winter along the Atlantic coast of North America in variable numbers (Supplementary Table 1). If the virus was transmitted to one of these populations during their stay on Iceland, it could have been spread to Newfoundland during the subsequent autumn migration. Importantly, Iceland-breeding Eurasian wigeons or Eurasian teals could be responsible for both the journey to Iceland from European wintering grounds, as well as the journey from Iceland to Newfoundland, where these species are frequently encountered as vagrants (Supplementary Table 1)20,21.The second possible route is via species that migrate from northwestern Europe to the Canadian High Arctic and/or Northwest Greenland. These include shorebirds (e.g. ruddy turnstone, red knot) and some geese (light-bellied brent goose and greater white-fronted goose). If the virus circulated in these breeding populations and then moved to other coastal marine bird populations bordering Baffin Bay, which include huge numbers of colonial seabirds and marine waterfowl22,23, the virus could have followed a coastal or even pelagic route south with the large autumn migration of Arctic marine birds (various sea ducks, auks and larids)24,25 to emerge in Newfoundland. Alternatively, shorebirds and waterfowl may have played a role: several European-wintering populations have overlapping breeding grounds with populations wintering along the east coast of North America. Regarding geese, greater white-fronted geese share breeding grounds in western Greenland with Canada geese26,27, which migrate south along the Canadian Atlantic coast. Also, brent geese have overlapping breeding grounds with snow geese18. In addition, individual barnacle geese and pink-footed geese breeding in Greenland could also have travelled south to Newfoundland carrying the virus, as these birds are regular vagrants to the North American Atlantic coast28. While geese occur only in small numbers on Newfoundland, two barnacle geese and four pink-footed geese, probably originating from Greenland breeding grounds, were observed in the autumn of 2021. St. John’s is the first major population center on a coastal route south from Baffin Bay/Davis Strait and along the Labrador Shelf, so emergence in eastern Newfoundland is consistent with this route.Three wild bird species involved in the Iceland and/or Greenland/High Canadian Arctic routes deserve particular attention. Eurasian wigeon have been prominently involved in outbreaks in Eurasia, and are considered prime candidates for carrying HPAI virus over long distances29. Also, during the first stages of an outbreak they are one of the first species to be detected HPAI virus positive, often without clinical signs. Barnacle geese and greylag geese, which congregate in Iceland, were in the top three most abundant species detected H5-positive in Europe in late winter and early spring 20215. Given that both greylag and barnacle geese have populations breeding on Iceland/Greenland and wintering in Europe (particularly the UK), these two species are high on the list of probable vectors that transported the virus to Iceland/Greenland and finally to Newfoundland. The high involvement of infected geese in the HPAI dynamics, which was not seen before October 2020, together with the unusually high levels of HPAI H5 virus presence in wild birds in Northwest Europe in spring 2021, might also explain why HPAI H5 virus spread to Newfoundland this winter (2021/2022), and not in the previous winters (2020/2021, 2016/2017, 2014/2015, 2005/2006). It is, however, striking that no cases of HPAI H5 virus have been recorded on Iceland in 2021.A third possible, pelagic, route is directly across the Atlantic Ocean. Such a route could have started with coastal and pelagic seabirds in Northwest Europe, where the virus may have remained undetected for much of the summer of 2021. A subsequent migration of seabirds to Newfoundland waters in the autumn of 2021 could have brought the virus to North America. The large populations of black-legged kittiwakes and northern fulmars that breed in the U.K. have long been known to frequent Newfoundland waters30, and these movements have been corroborated by recent telemetry studies31. Further, recent telemetry information reveals that millions of pelagic seabirds breeding all across the Atlantic congregate over the Mid-Atlantic Ridge in the central North Atlantic at all times of year32, making a pelagic transmission route a possibility. From the pelagic wintering grounds off Newfoundland, a species that uses both pelagic and coastal habitats, possibly a gull, may have brought the virus to shore in St. John’s. Trans-Atlantic transmission via seabirds has been suggested for LPAI viruses, including detection of mosaic Eurasian-North American viruses in gulls and alcids12,33,34,35.For the time period and geographical frame considered, HPAI-H5-positive species included ducks (Eurasian wigeon, mallard, common eider), geese (barnacle, greylag, brent, pink-footed and greater white-fronted goose), swans (whooper), gulls (black-headed, herring, lesser black-backed, great black-backed), and shorebirds (red knot, ruddy turnstone) (Supplementary Table 2). Of these 15 species, ringed individuals with a European origin have been recorded on Newfoundland for barnacle goose (1 ringed individual), Eurasian wigeon (5), great skua (13), and black-headed gull (1) (Supplementary Table 1). Ringed individuals with a European origin have been found on Newfoundland for 5 species which were found to be HPAI-H5-positive between October 2020 and April 2021, such as Barnacle Goose (1), Eurasian Wigeon (5), Great Skua (13), Black-headed Gull (1). These species might be considered to be possible carriers of HPAI H5 virus from Europe in late winter 2020/2021 or early spring 2021 partly or all the way to Newfoundland. However, given the incompleteness of sampling and the possibility of wild birds carrying HPAI virus subclinically, the involvement of other wild bird species in transatlantic virus transport cannot be ruled out.Having reached the Avalon Peninsula of Newfoundland via one of above routes, the virus may have spread further within the abundant local populations of ducks and gulls wintering in the city of St. John’s. The peridomestic populations of some of these species may be candidates for incursion of the virus into the farm in St John’s.ConclusionsIn conclusion, the HPAI H5N1 viruses that were detected in Newfoundland in November and December 2021 originated from Northwest Europe and belonged to HPAI clade 2.3.4.4b. Most likely, these viruses emerged in Northwest Europe in winter 2020/2021, dispersed from Europe in late winter or early spring 2021, and arrived in Newfoundland in autumn 2021. The viruses may have been carried across the Atlantic by migratory birds using different routes, including Icelandic, Greenland/Arctic, or pelagic routes. The unusually high presence of the viruses in European wild bird populations in late winter and spring 2021, as well as the greater involvement of barnacle and greylag geese in the epidemiology of HPAI in Europe since October 2020, may explain why spread to Newfoundland happened this winter (2021/2022), and not in the previous winters.The incursion of these HPAI viruses, which appear to be well-adapted to certain wild birds, raised concern at its first detection about the potential of HPAI virus to become established and spread in the Americas via wild birds (OFFLU reference). The concern was that if these viruses become established in the Atlantic Flyway, they could rapidly spread west to Mississippi, Central and Pacific Flyways. The implication of this scenario would be high wild bird mortality, risk for incursion into poultry holdings and those of other captive birds, as well as zoonotic risk. In fact, as of 4 April 2022, this virus has now been detected in wild birds in three flyways in North America and disease in commercial and/or backyard poultry flocks has been detected in 3 Canadian provinces and 24 US states (https://www.usgs.gov/centerswhc/science/distribution-highly-pathogenic-avian-influenza-north-america-20212022). Large scale mortality events have not been reported in wild birds, with most positive wild birds detected via testing of hunter-collected birds or testing of individual dead birds (https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-2022/2022-hpai-wild-birds).To prevent and mitigate the risk of viral spread, it will be vital to further increase surveillance of wild birds in North America and South America, as well as at migration stop-over stations in Iceland and Greenland. This should include virus detection with whole genome sequencing to enable molecular epidemiology. Collecting wild bird mortality reports can give an idea of the impact of the outbreak on local wild bird populations, and active surveillance is critical to identify vector species. The overlap of migratory movements of wild waterbirds along the Atlantic coast of North America with densely populated poultry areas may increase the risk of viral incursion into poultry farms, emphasizing the need for appropriate biosecurity measures and spatial planning of the poultry sector. The spread of HPAI H5 viruses from Europe to North America stresses the importance of close international cooperation and data exchange to better understand the global epidemiology of avian influenza, e.g. by swiftly identifying where these viruses emerged from and mitigating endemic disease in poultry to avoid these production systems potentially acting as future sources for emerging variants35 , and is a call to re-assess the poultry sector in a way that embraces the One Health perspective: to sustainably balance and optimize the health of people, animals and ecosystems (https://www.who.int/groups/one-health-high-level-expert-panel).Materials and methodsPhylogenetic analysisMethods for phylogenetic analysis were the same as Sagulenko 2018 and Poen 201936,37.Full genome sequences were obtained from nine clinical or postmortem samples of captive birds at the exhibition farm, and from one postmortem sample of a great black-backed gull from a nearby city pond.We searched for H5NX whole genome sequences in GISAID from Europe, Asia and Africa where samples were collected from 01-01-2021 through 27-12-2021. To these existing data we added eight unpublished sequences from Newfoundland, and three additional unpublished sequences from European wild birds collected in the timeframe to the GISAID database.We aligned the sequences using MAFFT v7.407 and trimmed to the starting ATG and ending STOP codon. Maximum-likelihood trees were inferred using IQ-TREE 2.1.3. and 1000 replicates for the Shimodaira–Hasegawa approximate likelihood ratio test. We used TreeTime, a Python-based framework for phylodynamic analysis using an approximate Maximum Likelihood approach to estimate ancestral states, and reroot trees to maximize temporal signals.Analysis of avian migrationWe evaluated the possible routes along which wild birds can migrate from Europe to North America, based on knowledge on existing migration routes as well as the retrieval of identification (bird) rings. We compared the information with the data of HPAI H5 virus-positive birds from Northwest European countries (i.e., UK, Ireland, Norway, Finland, Denmark, Germany, Netherlands, Belgium, France) that are the starting points, or are situated along these migratory routes. For the analysis, we prioritized the most abundant bird species, that also most frequently tested H5-positive during the 2020/2021 outbreak in Europe, as detected during active and passive surveillance38.We focused on bird species susceptible to avian influenza (waterfowl, gulls, shorebirds and seabirds) which either bred or made a migratory stopover on Iceland, this being the most likely connection between Europe and Newfoundland. We identified wintering grounds, staging sites and breeding grounds based on literature, using mostly the database of Birds of the World39,40. We estimated the population sizes breeding in Iceland or passing through Iceland during migration using Fox & Leafloor (2018), Icelandic Institute of Natural History (2021) and van Roomen (2018)40,41,42.We provided the number of individuals observed in Newfoundland from Ebird data19. We extracted all observations from complete lists done between September–December, 2011 to 2021 on Newfoundland. For rare species (with less than 10 records annually) we also included sightings from incomplete lists. For every year and species, we calculated the maximum number of observed individuals per location, and added these to calculate the total number of individuals observed in Newfoundland for every year. We then calculated the average number of individuals observed annually between 2011 and 2021, and the number observed in 2021. We identified the most likely origin of birds encountered in Newfoundland using the database Birds of the World39,40,41,42,43.Ring-recovery data were obtained from the EURING Migration mapping Tool MMT, an online tool under development, that provides information on movements of ringed birds between pre-set areas within Europe and to other areas of the world, based on the EURING databank. These data were augmented with published (individuals recovered up to 2002, Lyngs 2003)12,13,14,15,16, and unpublished data (to 2011) of birds ringed in Greenland supplied by Copenhagen Bird Ringing Centre. All records of individual birds moving between Northwest Europe (Norway & Sweden, Germany & Denmark, Belgium & Netherlands, Great Britain & Ireland) and Iceland and Faroe Islands, or Svalbard and other North Atlantic islands or Greenland, and individual birds moving between these areas and Canada or USA were selected. Prior to selection, unlikely records (finding date before ringing date, finding or ringing location not accurate etc.) were removed. For species not considered in the Migration Mapping Tool, only records of birds moving between Northwest Europe and Greenland, Canada or USA were available.To further evaluate which wild bird species might have been involved in transatlantic transport of HPAI H5 virus, we compared above bird migration patterns with reports of HPAI-H5-positive wild birds in Europe. We limited our evaluation to the period of six months up to April 2021, the latest MRCA date of the Newfoundland virus gene segments (see above), and to the coastal countries in Northwest Europe, which act as the main wintering areas for wild birds that migrate across the Atlantic.

Due to this, H5N6 clade 2.3.4.4b viruses pose a significant threat of causing infections in humans. Study: Novel Reassortant Avian Influenza A(H5N6) Virus, China, 2021. Image Credit: pinkeyes/Shutterstock Background There were 26 cases of laboratory-confirmed human infections by influenza A(H5N6) virus in China between 2014 and 2020. However, these sporadic infections gathered attention only by 2021, when the case figures rose beyond the cumulative numbers of the previous seven years in barely eight months and caused deaths. There is the availability of highly effective H5N6 vaccines, which reduce the likelihood of severe clinical disease and shedding of virus in poultry; yet, sporadic H5N6 infections occur in waterfowl. These birds have become a weak link in preventing the influenza A virus. Also, they have led to the uncontrolled spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) subtype H5Nx in poultry in China. Due to strict immunization policies for poultry in China, the H5N8 virus was quickly eliminated but reemerged in 2020, causing a serious threat of an endemic and subsequent zoonotic spill into humans. Since a surge in influenza A(H5N6) cases in humans, the prevalence and mode of H5N8 reassortment are of great concern. About the study In the present study, researchers identified a novel reassortant avian influenza A(H5N6) virus present across the poultry industry in China; that also caused a surge in human infections. They isolated an H5N6 virus from a sick duck on a poultry farm in Chengdu, Sichuan, China, in June 2021, and another from a dead chicken in the house of a human patient in Chongqing in July 2021. Further, they isolated two H5N6 viruses in August and September 2021 from chicken and goose farms in two Chinese provinces. Last, in October 2021, they detected five H5N6 viruses from Guangdong province, three from ducks, one from a goose, and one more from the environment. As per the World Health Organization (WHO) protocol, the researchers sequenced the genomes of all 10 H5N6 viruses and then constructed a maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree to categorize them into epidemic clades. All 10 H5N6 viruses belonged to the 2.3.4.4b hemagglutinin (HA) clade, with 99.1% to 100% similar HA genes. Related StoriesWHO announces recommended viral composition for 2025 influenza vaccinesStudy reveals distinct genetic risk factors for influenza and COVID-19Study reveals a promising approach to developing universal influenza vaccineThe researchers used Chongqing avian strains as a representative virus with human-origin virus sequences. It shared multiple similarities between the PB2, polymerase acidic, and nonstructural genes of the influenza A(H3N2) virus. The authors observed that this novel virus was reassorted with the H3N2 virus, deriving the polymerase basic (PB)1 gene from the influenza A(H1N2) virus. The HA and the matrix genes, with 99.2% and 99.9% similarity with the H5N8, pointed to origin from H5N8. Since it shared a similar neuraminidase gene with the H5N6 virus, it is also possible that the novel H5N6 virus is a reassortment of the H5N8 and H5N6 viruses. Another speculation is that the involvement of other low-pathogenicity avian influenza viruses in reassortment made the internal genes of all strains appear complex but inconsistent. Further, Bayesian analysis revealed that these viruses formed distinct clades based on geographic regions of origin. Current vaccine strains are ineffective against novel H5N6 circulating virus strains, suggesting the urgent need to update the vaccines to prevent further transmission. In fact, in January 2022, the Chinese government introduced new vaccine strains H5-Re14 and rHN5801 to combat poultry infection with the H5N6 virus. Several H5N6 viral infections in humans occurred during the non-influenza season in southern China within a short time, indicating its viral load has increased over time. Also, the researchers collected one viral specimen from a sewage ditch swab in a live poultry market in Dongguan, which indicates its presence in the environment. This further increases the probability of H5N6 infections in humans. Conclusions The current study identified 10 novel reassortment H5N6 virus strains from poultry and the surrounding environment that resembled human-origin H5N6 viral strains. The viral strains identified at the onset of endemic later clustered into three geographically characterized subclades. However, they all had similar mammalian susceptibility mutations, including T33K, L89V, and G309D, in their PB2 gene. The antigenic differences between vaccine antisera and these viruses could have implications for transmission risk.

Back to Healio Influenza-like illness conferred increased odds of 30-day stroke in young patients, but vaccination was associated with lower risk compared with non-vaccination, according to data published in Stroke. A similar analysis of middle-aged patients revealed similar odds of 30-day stroke tied to influenza-like illness; however, the protective effects of prior vaccination were more limited, according to the study. Data were derived from Vollmer BL, et al. Stroke. 2022;doi:10.1161/STROKEAHA.121.038403. “Vaccinating for influenza not only lowers your risk for influenza, but it also lowers the risk for stroke, particularly in younger adults. Influenza vaccination lowers the risk for stroke through a number of ways,” Amelia K. Boehme, PhD, MSPH, assistant professor of epidemiology in neurology at Columbia University, told Healio. “It can prevent someone from acquiring influenza, thereby preventing influenza-triggered stroke. People who are vaccinated for influenza tend to have a less severe form of influenza if they do have a breakthrough infection. Infection severity is associated with influenza-triggered stroke, so by lowering the severity of infection through the vaccine this reduces the risk for influenza-triggered stroke. Vaccinating regularly confers more immunity to influenza. The more years someone receives the influenza vaccine, the lower the risk for both influenza and stroke.” Researchers evaluated the relationships between influenza-like illness in the prior 30 days to admission and vaccination in the prior year on stroke among young and middle-aged individuals. The MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters database was utilized to identify 24,103 cases of stroke in patients aged 18 to 44 years and 141,811 aged 45 to 65 years from 2008 to 2014. The stroke group was matched to controls based on age on admission date. Controls were patients with head trauma or ankle sprain at an inpatient or ED visit. The primary outcome was ischemic and intracerebral hemorrhagic stroke. Influenza-like illness and stroke in young patients Researchers reported that patients aged 18 to 44 years experienced increased likelihood of stroke 30 days after influenza-like illness compared with controls (adjusted OR = 1.68; 95% CI, 1.51-1.86). Influenza-like illness was associated with increased odds of 30-day stroke regardless of vaccination status (P for interaction = .16): vaccinated (aOR = 1.41; 95% CI, 1.08-1.85); and unvaccinated (aOR = 1.73; 95% CI, 1.55-1.94). However, the odds of stroke were lower among patients with influenza-like illness and any vaccination in the year prior compared with their unvaccinated peers (aOR = 0.92; 95% CI, 0.87-0.99). Influenza-like illness and stroke in middle-aged patients Among patients aged 45 to 65 years, the adjusted likelihood of 30-day stroke risk was greater in patients with influenza-like illness compared with controls (aOR = 1.32; 95% CI, 1.26-1.38). Researchers observed no effect of vaccination on stroke risk in patients with influenza-like illness compared with controls (aOR = 1; 95% CI, 0.97-1.02). Although influenza-like illness was not associated with 30-day stroke among patients with any vaccination in the prior year (aOR = 1.07; 95% CI, 0.96-1.18), it was associated with odds of stroke among unvaccinated patients (aOR = 1.39; 95% CI, 1.32-1.47; P for interaction < .001). “The hypothesis for why vaccination conferred less protection from stroke among those aged 45 to 65 years is likely because the risk factors and mechanisms for stroke start to change in mid-age with traditional stroke risk factors having a larger effect on stroke risk than the less traditional stroke risk factors,” Boehme told Healio. “The takeaway message here is evidence vaccinating against influenza reduces the risk for both influenza and stroke — as well as MI — but that was not evaluated in this particular study. With the incidence and prevalence of stroke increasing in people aged 18 to 45 years, identifying ways to reduce the risk for stroke is of utmost importance. Vaccinating against influenza is one way to reduce the risk.” For more information: Amelia K. Boehme, PhD, MSPH, can be reached at akb2188@cumc.columbia.edu.

Pandemic influenza A viruses (IAV) that crossed the avian-human species barrier switched from binding avian-type α2-3-linked sialic acid (2-3Sia) to human-type 2-6Sia receptors. Here, we show that this specificity switch is however less dichotomous as generally assumed. Binding and entry specificity were compared using mixed synthetic glycan gradients of 2-3Sia and 2-6Sia and by employing a genetically remodeled Sia repertoire on the surface of a Sia-free cell line and on a sialoglycoprotein secreted from these cells. Expression of a range of (mixed) 2-3Sia and 2-6Sia densities shows that non-binding human-type receptors efficiently enhanced avian IAV binding and entry provided the presence of a low density of high affinity avian-type receptors, and vice versa. Considering the heterogeneity of sialoglycan receptors encountered in vivo, hetero-multivalent binding is physiologically relevant and will impact evolutionary pathways leading to host adaptation.

Waterfowl are the natural IAV reservoir while poultry and swine function as an intermediate reservoir1. To acquire transmissibility within the human population, avian IAVs need to overcome differences between the human and avian sialic acid (Sia) receptor repertoire2,3. Sias, which in avians and humans exclusively occur as the N-acetylneuraminic acid type, are monosaccharides terminating the glycan chains attached to membrane-associated and secreted glycoproteins and glycolipids. IAV infection by genotypes H1 to H16 is initiated by binding of hemagglutinin (HA) on the viral envelope to epithelial cell surface-exposed Sia receptors. A paradigm in IAV biology is the dichotomy in receptor specificity. Avian IAVs bind to a Sia linked by an α2-3-linkage to the penultimate galactose and human IAVs bind to α2-6-linked Sias4,5. Binding specificity matches the dominant Sia-linkage type at the preferred infection sites, being the enteric tract of waterfowl and upper respiratory tract of humans6,7,8. Often, α2-3 and α2-6 Sia linkages are found coinciding, at various ratios, on the different types of glycoproteins and glycolipids found at these sites which is thought to support the occasional infection of specific stretches of the swine or human respiratory tract by some avian IAVs. A positive correlation between receptor binding avidity and infection efficiency has been demonstrated9,10, but ample examples suggest the lack of a strict correlation8,11,12,13,14. This controversy likely originates from large differences in complexity of the artificial, rather homogeneous, receptor surfaces that are employed for determining IAV binding avidity and specificity and the highly diverse sialoglycan repertoire presented on cultured cells and respiratory epithelium. N- and O-linked glycans attached to proteins and glycolipids each encompass a specific range of glycan structures that vary by linkages and extent of sialylation and differ in diversity and distribution between species, tissue and cell type. This is important as receptor binding avidity of IAVs is, apart from the α2-3/α2-6 linkage-type, affected by the underlying structure of the glycan12,15. For instance, H3N2 causing seasonal human flu has evolved since 1968 to a binding preference for multi-antennary glycans extended by multiple LacNAc repeats12,16.Individual HA-receptor interactions are short-lived because of their low affinity (KD ~0,5 to 20 mM)17,18,19,20,21. This leads to a relatively low initial virus binding rate, while high-avidity virus binding results from multivalent interaction with a receptor-coated surface22,23,24,25 thereby promoting efficient virus entry. Sialoglycans that are identified as high-avidity IAV binders by in vitro binding assays, for example glycan arrays13,26,27, are considered prime candidates for supporting IAV binding and entry. However, epithelial cell surfaces display a highly heterogeneous Sia repertoire of low and high affinity receptors that may simultaneously interact with a virus particle. Such a binding mode has been described for glycan binding by lectins, glycosidases and glycosyltransferases and is referred to as hetero-multivalent binding28,29,30,31. Importantly, it has never been investigated to which extent low affinity interactions contribute to high-avidity virus binding and entry by such a hetero-multivalent binding mode.Here, we challenge the paradigm of the canonical 2-3/2-6Sia receptor dichotomy. We show that, by hetero-multivalent binding, synthetic sialoglycans which by themselves cannot support binding can compensate for insufficient amounts of preferred receptors for avian as well as human IAV strains. Subsequently, we systematically tune the sialoglycan composition on the cell membrane of a Sia-deficient HEK293 cell line (HEKΔSia)32 by co-transfection with specific sialyltransferases. In this way mixed 2-3/2-6Sia gradients are presented on the cell surface, allowing virus entry studies, and on a sialoglycoprotein secreted from these cells, allowing to study the binding dynamics by biolayer interferometry (BLI). The results show that Sia receptors hitherto not supposed to support IAV binding, actually contributed to enhanced binding and infection.ResultsHetero-multivalent IAV binding to synthetic glycansTo assess the contribution of low-affinity interactions to hetero-multivalent IAV binding to heterogenous receptor surfaces, we determined the binding of human seasonal H3N2 strain VI75 and avian H5N1 strain HU02 to BLI sensors coated with (mixtures of) 2-6- and 2-3-linked Sias. These viruses display the canonical Sia linkage-type binding specificity for human-type [2-6S(LN)2] or avian-type [2-3 S(LN)2] receptors respectively (Fig. 1a, b). At 7.5% to 15% density of these specific receptors only very limited virus binding was observed (Fig. 1c–f; black lines). However, by complementing a low density of the high-affinity receptor with the apparently non-binding low-affinity receptor (e.g., 7.5% 2-3 S(LN)2 plus 92.5% 2-6(LN)2 for HU02 in Fig. 1d), the binding rate of HU02 or VI75 could be strongly enhanced. We conclude that Sias which are generally considered to be non-binding receptors (2-3Sia for human IAVs or 2–6Sia for avian IAVs), can efficiently support binding by hetero-multivalency effects when the high-affinity Sia receptors are present at a low density that by itself cannot support binding.Fig. 1: Low-affinity receptors enhance IAV binding rate in presence of a low density of high-affinity receptors.a–f, ~100 pM suspensions of human H3N2 strain VI75 (a, c, e) or avian H5N1 strain HU02 (b, d, f) were associated for 600 s to BLI sensors loaded to maximum density (0.6 pM/cm2) with 100% 2-6 S(LN)2 (Neu5Aca2-6Galβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-3Galβ1-4GlcNAc) or 2-3 S(LN)2 (a, b) or with mixtures of these two synthetic glycans and the asialo glycan LN2 (Galβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-3Galβ1-4GlcNAc) at relative amounts as indicated in the figure (c–f) and illustrated in (g) as an example for panels a, c and e (2-6 Sia, purple diamonds; 2-3 Sia, light green diamonds; galactose, yellow; N-acetylglucosamine, blue).The inserts display the binding rate relative to the maximal binding rate obtained to sensors loaded with 100% 2-6S(LN)2 (a, c, e) or 100% 2-3S(LN)2 (b, d, f). Statistical significance (P) was calculated by two-tailed unpaired t test on biological replicates (a, b n = 6; c–f n = 3). (*P = 0.0493; **P = 0.0085; ***P = 0.0005; ****P < 0.0001). Data are presented as mean values +/−S.D. Panel g was Created with BioRender.com. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageNext, the IAV binding rate enhancement by low-affinity receptors was quantified over the full density range of the high-affinity receptor complemented by either the low-affinity receptor or the asialoglycan (LN)2 (Fig. 2). Virus binding rates were determined from the slope of the binding curves (examples shown in Supplementary Fig. 1a, b). Binding rates were normalized to the highest binding rate for each virus and plotted against the relative density of the high-affinity receptor (Fig. 2a). Four human H3N2 strains isolated between 1975 and 2002 (VI75, BK79, WU95, FU02) displayed positive hetero-multivalent binding effects (Fig. 2a–d) as complementation of the high-affinity 2-6S(LN)2 receptors with low-affinity 2-3S(LN)2 receptors (magenta lines) resulted in a leftward-shifted binding curve in comparison to complementation by asialoglycans (black lines). The lab-adapted, human-derived, H1N1 strain PR8 isolated in 1934 (Fig. 2e) and the avian H5N1 strain HU02 (Fig. 2f) displayed a similar shift when the high-affinity 2-3S(LN)2 receptors where complemented with the low-affinity 2-6 S(LN)2 receptors. To confirm that hetero-multivalent binding can have a positive effect on binding of other avian IAVs we show similar effects on an H5N8 virus strain and on another H5N1 IAV (Supplementary Fig. 2). We conclude that positive hetero-multivalent binding effects by low-affinity receptors are widespread, occurring for human viruses specifically binding 2-6Sia receptors as well as avian viruses specifically binding 2-3Sia receptors. At low densities of the high-affinity receptor, surface binding is absolutely dependent on hetero-multivalent binding effects. As shown for VI75 (Supplementary Fig. 3), the magnitude of a positive hetero-multivalency effect also depends on the density of the low-affinity receptor. The effect of the low-affinity receptor density is more gradual than of the high-affinity receptor density (note the smaller slope of the lines of Supplementary Fig. 3 in comparison to Fig. 2).Fig. 2: Low-affinity receptors lower the threshold density for IAV binding by hetero-multivalent interactions to a heterogenous receptor surface.Relative virus binding rates were plotted as a function of relative receptor density for human H3N2 strains VI75 (a), BK79 (b), WU95 (c) and FU02 (d), human H1N1 strain PR8 (e) and avian H5N1 strain HU02 (f). The relative density of the high-affinity receptor is plotted on the x-axis. The black curves display binding to the high-affinity receptor complemented to 100% density with the asialo glycan LN2 (Galβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-3Galβ1-4GlcNAc) whereas the magenta curves display binding to the high-affinity receptor complemented to 100% density with the low-affinity glycans. Relative binding rates are calculated for each point from individual binding curves for each density (see Supplementary Fig. 1 for an example). The absolute binding rates of the different virus strains are plotted in Fig. 3c showing that they differ less than 2-fold. Typical examples from 3 biological replicates are shown for each virus. R-sq values for fitted curves are indicated. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageGenetic tuning of the sialoglycan content in HEKΔSia cellsThe maximal synthetic sialoglycan receptor density of ~0.0036 Sia moieties per nm2 23 on a BLI biosensor surface is low in comparison to ~1 to 6 Sias per nm2 in the cell glycocalyx33. Also, glycan presentation on a flat biosensor surface poorly mimics the thick glycocalyx in which a large part of the Sias will be shielded from interaction with virus particles. To mimic in vivo Sia density and presentation more closely an experimental setup (Fig. 3a) was established that enables direct comparison of virus binding and entry. We genetically modified the sialylation pattern of a cell line that was used for virus entry as well as production of a sialoglycoprotein receptor used for virus binding. The Sia repertoire of HEKΔSia cells, depleted of endogenous Sia expression by deletion of all ST6Gal and ST3Gal isoenzymes32, was specifically tuned by transient expression of sialyltransferases ST6Gal1 and/or ST3Gal4. These two transferases specifically sialylate the terminal LacNAc extensions that are especially abundant on N-linked glycoproteins. To enable virus binding analysis by BLI on a sialoglycoprotein receptor with a similar sialylation pattern as these transfected HEKΔSia cells, the luminal domain of lysosomal-associated membrane glycoprotein I (LAMP I, carrying 18 N-linked glycans) was expressed in these cells. It is important to note that virus binding specificity for LAMP I carrying either 2-3Sias or 2-6Sias differs substantially from the pattern obtained on synthetic glycan receptors (Fig. 3b, c). HU02 (H5N1) is absolute 2-3Sia specific and BK79 and WU95 (H3N2) are absolute 2-6Sia specific on protein and synthetic glycan receptors. However FU02 (H3N2), which is 2-6Sia specific on synthetic glycans, does not bind to LAMP I at all. VI75 is dual-specific on LAMP I but mostly binds 2-6Sia on synthetic glycans. PR8 is relatively 2-3Sia-specific on both receptor types but displays moderate 2-6Sia binding on both.Fig. 3: Hetero-multivalent binding to sialoglycoprotein LAMP I decorated with complementary gradients of 2-3Sia and 2-6Sia.a Graphical summary of methods that were employed to establish density gradients on HEKΔSia cells and LAMP I. The Sia repertoire exposed on HEKΔSia cells was specifically tuned by transfection with different concentrations of ST6Gal1 and/or ST3Gal4. Co-transfected LAMP I will be secreted in a C-terminally biotinylated form that can be attached to streptavidin BLI sensors for comparing entry into HEKΔSia cells with binding to LAMP I with a similar sialylation pattern in a BLI assay. b, c Comparison of virus binding rates to avian-type and human-type receptors. Absolute binding rates (nm/300 s), normalized to a particle number of 109 particles of each virus strain, were determined. b Binding to sensors fully loaded with LAMP I produced in HEKΔSia cells co-transfected with 25 ng ST6Gal1 or 25 ng ST3Gal4 yielding high levels of LacNAc termini carrying 2-6Sia (magenta bars) or 2-3Sia (black bars). c Binding to sensors fully loaded with 2-6S(LN)2 (magenta bars) or 2-3S(LN)2 (black bars). Relative binding rates were plotted as a function of relative receptor density for human H3N2 strains BK79 (d) and WU95 (e), avian H5N1 strain HU02 (f) and human H1N1 strain PR8 (g). Black lines show binding to LAMP I proteins obtained by co-expression with a concentration range of sialyltransferases ST6Gal1 (d, e) or ST3Gal4 (f, g). Magenta lines show binding to LAMP I proteins obtained by co-expression of a concentration range of ST6Gal1 in combination with 25 ng ST3Gal4 (d, e) or a concentration range of ST3Gal4 in combination with 25 ng ST6Gal1 (f, g). 2-6Sia density or 2-3Sia density on LAMP I was quantified by SNA or MAL I binding respectively and plotted on the x-axis as relative SNA (d, e) or MAL I (f, g) signal reflecting the relative receptor density. Data from biological replicates were fitted into single curves of which R-sq values are indicated. (b n = 7, 3, 8, 8, 3, 3, 4, 4, 3, 3, 9 and 4 for each bar from left to right; c n = 6, 6, 4, 8, 3, 3, 4, 7, 3, 3, 5 and 4 for each bar from left to right). Data are presented as mean values +/−S.D. Panel a was Created with BioRender.com. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageHEK cells and LAMP I containing a range of Sia densities (2-3Sia, 2-6Sia or mixtures of both at different ratios) were obtained by transfection of HEKΔSia cells with varying amounts of plasmids encoding the sialyltransferases ST6Gal1 and/or ST3Gal4. Sia content of the differentially sialylated LAMP I batches was quantified by plotting lectin binding (SNA, 2-6Sia specific; MAL I, 2-3Sia specific) against the amount of sialyltransferase that was used. Data from 4 to 6 biological replicates were assembled in a single plot showing the high reproducibility of amount of sialylation at a specific expression condition (Supplementary Fig. 4). Clearly, ST3Gal4 and ST6Gal1 compete for terminal galactose substrates, as shown by reduction of 2-6Sia levels (detected by SNA binding) when a ST6Gal1 concentration range is co-expressed with increasing amounts of ST3Gal4 (Supplementary Fig. 4c). In conclusion, Sia density of complementary 2-6Sia/2-3Sia gradients expressed on LAMP I can be quantified by lectin staining. Therefore, plotting lectin staining against virus binding will allow to identify hetero-multivalent binding effects for IAV binding to natural glycoprotein receptors.Hetero-multivalent IAV binding to the sialoglycan protein receptor LAMP IThe binding rate of 2-6Sia-specific human IAV strains BK79 and WU95 to a series of LAMP I proteins displaying increasing amounts of 2-6-linked Sia was determined by BLI (Fig. 3d, e). 2-6Sia was complemented by 2-3Sia (magenta lines) or by asialoglycan (black lines). The presence of 2-3Sias on LAMP I enhanced the binding rate of BK79 and WU95 as shown by the leftward shift of the magenta lines relative to the black lines. Thus, in the presence of 2-3Sia moieties, a lower density of 2-6Sia on LAMP I is required to be able to support binding. Such a positive hetero-multivalent binding effect is also seen for 2-3Sia specific virus strains HU02 (H5N1) and PR8 (H1N1) where in this case 2-3Sias are complemented by 2-6Sia. Note that for all four strains (shown in Fig. 3d–g) no binding was observed when LAMP I was decorated with the low-affinity Sia only. We conclude that positive hetero-multivalent binding effects assist binding of H3N2, H1N1 and H5N1 to sialoglycoprotein receptors.The effect of sialic acid receptor density on virus infection efficiencyBinding avidities derived from in vitro binding assays often do not correlate quantitatively with virus entry efficiency into cell line cultures. Likely, virus binding dynamics to the highly complex glycocalyx of cells involves hetero-multivalent interactions with a diverse range of Sia receptors of unknown density and distribution on the cell surface including O-linked glycans and glycolipids. Specific tuning of the Sia receptor repertoire on the surface of HEKΔSia cells by co-transfection of ST6Gal1 and ST3Gal4 offers unique opportunities to assess the effect of hetero-multivalent binding on cell entry using a luciferase reporter assay34. We first determined the dependency of virus infection efficiency on the density and specificity of Sia receptors on the surface of HEKΔSia cells that were co-transfected with a concentration range of sialyltransferases ST6Gal1 or ST3Gal4. Clearly, infection was highly specific for the expressed Sia linkage-type for human H3N2 strains BK79 and WU95 (2-6Sia) and for avian strain HU02 (2-3Sia, Fig. 4a–c). PR8 was slightly less specific as transfection with high amounts of ST6Gal1 supported efficient entry (Fig. 4d). Entry by Sia-independent enterovirus CVB3 was identical in all (transfected) cell types showing, as a control for cell integrity, that the differential display of sialyltransferases specifically affects IAV entry (Supplementary Fig. 5). Entry of HU02 into HEKΔSia cells and HEKΔSia cells transfected with ST6Gal1 showed the same basal level of entry that potentially represents some SIA-independent entry (Supplementary Fig. 5). IAV infection efficiency was dependent on the amount of sialyltransferase that was used for transfection consistent with the FACS data of HEKΔSia cells transfected with sialyltransferases, which showed that the density of cell surface Sia correlates with the amount of transfected sialyltransferase (Supplementary Fig. 6). Remarkably, a maximal infection efficiency was reached for 2-6Sia-dependent entry, followed by a decline upon further increase of transfected ST6Gal1 dose (Fig. 4a, b). Likely, this relates to other factors known to affect virus binding efficiency, like for instance the number of LacNAc repeats of a sialylated glycan antennae16. Capping of glycan chains by sialic acid will block the addition of additional sugar moieties and therefore glycan chain length is dependent on the level of sialyltransferase activity.Fig. 4: Low-affinity receptors contribute to virus entry efficiency.a–d Virus entry efficiency into HEKΔSia cells transfected with a concentration range of sialyltransferases ST6Gal1 (magenta lines) or ST3Gal4 (black lines) was determined using a luciferase reporter and a single-round infection assay. Relative entry efficiency into cells (normalized to the highest value) was plotted as a function of transfected sialyltransferase quantities. Data are from four biological replicates and each point represents the mean of 3 measurements. Entry often reached a maximal efficiency followed by a decline upon further increase of transfected sialyltransferase concentration. Data points beyond maximal entry efficiency were not fitted to the curves. e Comparison of virus binding and entry kinetics. Relative entry efficiency (black line) and binding rate to LAMP I (solid magenta line) or 2-6 S(LN)2 (dotted magenta line) of human H3N2 strain BK79 was plotted as a function of receptor density. The lower x-axis shows the amount of ST6Gal1 that was used for transfection of HEKΔSia cells into which entry was performed or in which LAMP I glycoprotein receptor was expressed. Top x-axis shows the density of 2-6S(LN)2 receptor as percentage of the maximal density of 0.6 pM/cm2 (corresponding to ~0.0036 Sia moieties per nm2 23). BLI binding data for BK79 come from experiments shown in Fig. 2b (2-6S(LN)2) and Fig. 3d (LAMP I). In addition relative SNA binding (performed to the same sensors as used for virus binding) was plotted in parallel (teal lines). Entry data for BK79 were derived from the experiment shown in Fig. 4a. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageTo directly compare how receptor density affects virus binding and entry we re-plotted the binding and entry results for BK79 obtained above in parallel on the same scale (Fig. 4e). BK79 entry efficiency (Fig. 4e, black line) and BK79 binding rate to LAMP I (Fig.4e, solid magenta line) are plotted against ST6Gal1 on the lower x-axis and compared to BK79 binding to 2-6S(LN)2 (dotted magenta line) plotted against receptor density on an identical logarithmic scale (upper x-axis). The steep slope of the BK79 binding curves is reflecting the super-selective binding mode that is inherent to the binding of multivalent particles to a receptor surface (see discussion) and contrasts with the shallower binding curves for bivalent SNA lectin binding (teal lines) observed on LAMP I and synthetic glycans. Hetero-multivalent interactions with low-affinity receptors further decrease the threshold-density of the high-affinity receptor required for binding, still supporting a super-selective binding mode (see the similar slope of the hetero-multivalent binding curves in Figs. 2 and 3 in comparison to lines obtained on homogeneous receptors). Entry into cells (Fig. 4e, black line) is detected at lower ST6Gal1 doses than binding to LAMP I. Super-selective virus binding translates into efficient virus entry above the receptor threshold as the slope of the BK79 entry curve is only slightly less steep than for BK79 binding. Although the highly complex cell surface may harbor patches of high glycan-density that are lacking on LAMP I, we conclude that very low densities of the specific receptor efficiently support virus entry.The effect of hetero-multivalent IAV binding on IAV infection efficiencyTo determine effects of hetero-multivalency on virus entry, suboptimal concentrations of ST6Gal1 and ST3Gal4 (i.e. supporting only very limited entry) were selected from the graphs in Fig. 4a–d and transfected in combination into cell line HEKΔSia. After 24 h cells were infected with IAV strains BK79, WU95, HU02 and PR8 (Fig. 5). An ST3Gal4 concentration-dependent increase of infection by 2-6Sia specific strains BK79 and WU95 was observed in combination with the highest concentration of ST6Gal1 (0.8 ng). Similarly, an ST6Gal1 concentration-dependent increase of infection by 2-3Sia specific strains HU02 and PR8 was observed in combination with the highest concentration of ST3Gal4 (0.2 ng). Thus, at a relatively low concentration of the high-affinity receptor, entry is enhanced by the presence of a Sia receptor that by itself only supports very low levels of entry. Importantly, all entry experiments were performed in the absence of the neuraminidase (NA) inhibitor Oseltamivir Carboxylate (OC). Therefore, we conclude that hetero-multivalent binding effects enhance entry efficiency of IAV and can be observed under natural conditions where NA is active.Fig. 5: Coinfection of low-affinity receptors enhances IAV infection.a–d HEKΔSia cells were transfected with the indicated combinations of ST3Gal4 and ST6gal1. The transfected amount of the high-affinity receptor is indicated on the x-axis and of the low-affinity receptor by the color of the bars. Note that co-expressed ST3Gal4 and ST6Gal1 are in competition (Supplementary Fig 3C). Bars represent the average of 3 biological replicates that are all performed in triplicates. Statistical significance (P) was calculated by two-tailed unpaired t test on biological replicates (n = 9).

Data are presented as mean values +/−S.D. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageDiscussionOver 400 (sialo) glycans have been identified on respiratory epithelium8,35,36,37. A range of assays previously identified many of them as non-binders for particular IAV strains with the α2-3/α2-6 dichotomy in avian versus human IAV receptor preference as the most striking result. Here we show that such presumed non-binders can play an important role in IAV binding and subsequent cell entry via a hetero-multivalent binding mode that has hitherto only been described for lectins and glycosyltransferases28,29,30,31. We first identified hetero-multivalent IAV binding using heterogeneous sets of synthetic glycans loaded on BLI sensors. Subsequently, we designed a quantitative method for genetic tuning of the glycan composition on HEK cells and a secreted glycoprotein. Using these, we showed that hetero-multivalent binding enhances IAV entry efficiency. These findings challenge the longstanding point of view that avian-type 2-3Sia receptors hardly contribute to infection by human IAVs that require 2-6Sias for binding, and vice versa. This emphasizes the need to consider virus binding in the context of the receptor diversity and distribution on a relevant target tissue.We propose a model for hetero-multivalent binding as shown in Fig. 6a. Because of the low affinity of HA-Sia interactions (KD is ~1 to ~20 mM18,19,20), even the initial monovalent interaction between a viral HA and its preferred receptor (left panel, receptor-associated HAs are indicated in magenta) is very short-lived (half-life less than a few seconds). As a result, the balance is towards dissociation (black arrows). Still, some particles will form a second interaction, resulting in bivalent binding. The KD (= koff/kon) of the initial interaction, as well as receptor density, are major factors that determine the frequency of bi-valent complex formation which, by its much higher avidity, promotes engagement of additional receptors. The equilibrium of an initial interaction with a non-preferred receptor of relatively low affinity (right panel) will however be further to the unbound state, thereby almost completely preventing a transition to bivalent binding. In contrast, at a surface of mixed low- and high-affinity receptors (middle panel), low-affinity receptors can function in the formation of the second and subsequent interactions leading to increase of avidity by hetero-multivalent binding, even though they are not able to initiate high-avidity virus binding by themselves (further details can be found in the legend to Fig. 6). In summary, a high-affinity primary sialoglycan attachment receptor is required to initiate stable multivalent binding to a heterogeneous receptor-landscape that can be largely composed of a range of low-affinity sialoglycan receptors. Clearly, the canonical 2-3Sia/2-6Sia binding dichotomy of human versus avian IAVs is far from absolute.Fig. 6: Model for hetero-multivalent IAV binding.a Avian IAV interactions with high-affinity (2-3Sia), low-affinity (2-6Sia) or mixed receptor surfaces. Arrow size indicates how kon and koff relatively compare. The initial, intermolecular and virus concentration dependent, monovalent interaction (KD = koff/kon ~ 1–20 mM) is characterized by a low binding rate constant kon (M−1 s−1) and high dissociation rate constant koff (s−1, half-life time of 0.5 to a few seconds)17,18,19,20,21. Additional interactions will lead to longer lasting virus-to-surface binding. The second, concentration-independent, interaction depends on the koff of the first interaction and a second kon2 that depends on the nature of, and accessibility to, a second glycan. A koff2 for virus dissociation is much lower than koff1 as it describes a bivalent interaction. This initiates a cascade of sequentially faster engagement of subsequent receptors. Thus, IAV binding rate primarily depends on an initial high-affinity interaction with a 2-3Sia receptor that determines the chance of forming additional interactions with high-affinity 2-3Sia receptors (left panel) or by hetero-multivalent interactions with low-affinity 2-6Sia receptors (middle panel). However, at a homogeneous 2-6Sia receptor surface (right panel), the KD for the initial interaction in combination with a 2nd kon for a 2-6Sia receptor will not support multivalent binding (note that reported KD values for low and high affinity receptors for IAV strains differ only ~1.5 to 3-fold19). b Hetero-multivalent binding via the HA receptor binding site (RBS, magenta), a vestigial esterase site (VES, grey) and a secondary Sia binding site (2SBS, orange) on NA. As an example potential interactions for a bi-antennary receptor carrying a 2-3Sia (purple) and 2-6Sia (light green) are shown: inter-trimeric (1) and intra-trimer binding (2) of the RBS; inter-trimeric (3) and intra-trimer (4) binding via the RBS and VES; HA-NA binding via RBS and 2SBS (5). c NA activity effects on heterogeneous receptor surfaces. NA catalytic site (white) activity depends on substrate structure, being higher on 2-3Sia (kcat1) than on 2-6Sia (kcat2). Catalytic activity can be affected by arrangement of receptors via the different binding sites, for instance by binding to 2SBS like in (6). NA activity drives virus motility by reducing receptor density (7). Created with BioRender.com.Full size imageMultiple reports have described the presence of a secondary sialic acid binding site (2SBS) on NA38,39 as well as a secondary sialic acid binding site, called the vestigial esterase subdomain (VES), on HA18. The 2SBS is conserved in avian, but not in human IAVs40,41,42, and displays 2-3Sia specificity although a 2SBS of much lower affinity was suggested to be present in some pandemic H1N1 strains43. Binding affinity for the putative VES was estimated to be ~200 mM44. Such potential binding sites of low affinity may expand the options of forming different hetero-multivalent interaction networks as illustrated in Fig. 6b and is further described in the legend to Fig. 6b. These diverse and highly dynamic interaction networks may in turn affect the efficiency of NA to associate with, and cleave, Sias, thereby influencing virus motility and dissociation (Fig. 6c).The steep sigmoidal IAV binding curves (Figs. 2 and 3) correspond with a super-selective binding mode of multivalent ligands to a receptor surface45,46. Super-selective binding to high affinity receptors was observed for homogeneous and heterogeneous receptor surfaces, even when the monovalent KD for high-affinity receptors (e.g., 2-3Sias) is only slightly lower than low-affinity receptors (e.g., 2-6Sias) that do not bind by themselves. Importantly, low-affinity receptors can lower the density threshold required for binding to high-affinity receptors (Figs. 2 and 3). Strikingly, virus entry also rapidly increases above a threshold receptor density (Fig. 4e) suggesting that, in contrast to what has been frequently reported8,11,12,13,14, there is a strong positive correlation between binding avidity and entry. The strict correlation between binding and entry is further corroborated by the enhancement of entry efficiency under conditions that support hetero-multivalent binding (Fig. 5). Importantly, different respiratory tissues are often highly enriched for either 2-3 or 2-6 sialosides but neither of them is ever completely absent giving ample opportunity for a hetero-multivalent binding mode in vivo. Specific tuning of the glycan receptor repertoire of HEKΔSia cells has been of critical importance for identifying the positive effect of hetero-multivalent binding on IAV entry. The limited receptor diversity resulting from sialylation of Galβ1,4GlcNAc termini by ST6Gal1 and/or ST3Gal4 on HEKΔSia cells still contrasts, however, with the complex glycan repertoire exposed on epithelial cells. This receptor complexity, which is hardly assessed by current binding assays, can be further dissected and correlated to entry by the receptor tuning approach taken here.Hetero-multivalent interactions have implications for virus entry, tropism and evolution. Receptor-bound IAV particles are highly motile22,47 and explore the cell surface for minutes before entry48,49. This NA activity-driven directional motility and entry efficiency depends on balanced NA and HA activity23,47,50. NA activity may be affected by hetero-multivalent interactions as, like HA, NA displays receptor specificity. Avian IAVs, engaging 2-3 Sias for primary attachment, preferentially cleave 2-3Sias over 2-6Sias (Fig. 6c, kcat1 > kcat2). Upon primary attachment to a heterogeneous receptor surface via high-affinity receptors, migration to poorly cleavable 2-6Sia-rich clusters could reduce motility which has been observed to precede cell entry48,49. IAV particle binding-induced clustering of sialylated receptors at such spots51 is signaling induction of their uptake by endocytosis34,48,51,52,53,54,55,56. High-avidity binding via low-affinity interactions has been shown to efficiently induce clustering and signaling in other systems57. Thus, signaling receptors decorated with Sias with either low or high affinity could be clustered by any particular IAV strain translocating over the cell surface upon binding initiated by hetero-multivalent interactions at a distant spot. In summary, entry efficiency can directly be enhanced through hetero-multivalent interactions, increasing binding rate and possibly exerting effects on virus motility, receptor clustering and signaling.Hetero-multivalent binding likely also affects cell-type specificity as well as within-host evolution. We here showed that seasonal IAVs displaying a 2-6Sia binding preference, could infect cell types displaying a very low 2-6Sia density by hetero-multivalent binding (and likewise for avian IAVs and 2-3Sias). Such cells are present in the 2-3Sia-rich lower parts of the human respiratory tract, a place where IAV infection more easily causes enhanced pathogenicity like pneumonia. Recent H3N2 strains have evolved to bind 2-6Sias attached to extended chains of LacNAc repeats on multi-antennary glycans and display decreased avidity for the more abundant shorter glycans12,16. Also, a 2-3Sia-binding pH1N1 virus rapidly evolved to airborne transmission in ferrets by acquiring binding to long-chain 2-6Sias, most likely being selected on the soft palate that presents these receptors as well as 2-3Sia receptors58. Hetero-multivalent binding may enable the evolution of such viruses by retaining some affinity for the abundant “old” receptor. In that case, only a low-density of the new high-affinity receptor will be required.Little is known about the evolutionary track leading to adaptation to novel host receptor repertoires. Early isolates of four IAV pandemics already acquired a large specificity-switch to a human 2-6Sia receptor. Although this switch requires only two mutations in HA, the infrequent occurrence of IAV pandemics is attributed to the requirement for simultaneous mutations in multiple segments, collectively enabling human-to-human transmission. Avian strains H5N1 and H7N9, causing severe infections of the 2-3Sia-rich human lower respiratory tract, did not acquire human-to-human transmission in 25 years. Likely, acquisition of increased 2-6Sia-binding has no selective advantage in the lower respiratory tract. However, 2-6Sia-rich respiratory surfaces with a minimally required 2-3Sia density can support hetero-multivalent binding and entry of avian IAVs resulting in selective advantages for mutations that increase 2-6Sia binding. Such mutations can function as stepping stones towards the genesis of a human-transmissible virus. Intermediate host species may provide such an environment. Indeed, whereas human nasal epithelial cells - a favorable location for human transmissible IAVs59 - are almost exclusively decorated with 2-6Sia, a gradient of 2-3Sia concentrations along the 2-6Sia-rich tracheal surface of swine was demonstrated to occur60. In line herewith, a gradual shift to the use of 2-6Sia receptors in swine has been demonstrated very recently for an avian-derived swine IAV lineage61. Hetero-multivalent interactions with such areas on the respiratory epithelium, as well as with decoy receptors present in the overlaying mucus, could be a key factor in the evolutionary pathways leading to host adaptation.MethodsVirus strainsThe human H3N2 recombinant influenza strains used in this paper were generated and described previously62: A/Bilthoven/1761/76 H3N2 (GenBank accession no. ADT78971) (VI75); A/Netherlands/233/82 193 N (GenBank accession no. AFH00725) (BK79); A/Netherlands/178/95 145 K (GenBank accession no. AIU46036) (WU95); A/Netherlands/213/03 (GenBank accession no. AIU46062) (FU02). H1N1 strain A/Puerto Rico/8/34/Mount Sinai (H1N1, PR8) was also used. Recombinant H5N1 (referred to as HU02 WT in this paper) contains the NA gene (GenBank accession no. BAM85820.1) and the HA gene (GenBank accession no. ACA47835.1) from A/duck/Hunan/795/2002(H5N1) in the background of A/Puerto Rico/8/34/Mount Sinai (H1N1, PR8). Cell culture adaptation of this strain leads to the stable introduction of mutation A156T in H5 after a few passages. This mutation introduces a glycosylation site at position 154 as is present in many contemporary H5N1 field isolates (e.g., ABC66574.1) and is referred to as HU02. Recombinant H5N8 influenza strain carries the HA gene of strain A/Chicken/Netherlands/14015526/2014 (GISAID accession no. EPI_ISL_167905) in the background of 7 PR8 segments. Virus strains were propagated by inoculating seed stocks into Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK)-II as described34 and stored at −80 °C. Enterovirus strain RlucCVB3 was obtained by transfection of infectious clones pRluc-53CB3/T763 and stored in lab, MOI = 0.1 was used in infection and luciferase reporter assay.Nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA)Virus particle numbers were determined by Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA) using a NanoSight NS3000 (Malvern Panalytical) as described for quantifying IAV particle numbers42. Briefly, 100 ul of virus samples were loaded into the NTA chamber five times independently. If necessary, virus samples were diluted in PBS before measurement and analyzed again. Particle numbers were determined as the average of five measurements. Multiple independent batches of each virus strain were measured for biological replicates of experiments. Particle numbers of all virus batches used in this paper were within 1.0 × 109 and 5.0 × 109 virus particles/ml. Virus particle numbers were used to normalize virus binding rate in binding assays and normalize infection levels among virus strains in infection assays.Expression and purification of biotinylated glycoprotein receptorsAll recombinant glycoproteins were expressed in a HEK293-derived knock-out cell line HEKΔSia 64, that lacks all Siaα2-3Gal and Siaα2-6Gal glycotopes on cell surfaces as eight sialyltransferases (ΔST3GAL1/2/3/4/5/6 and ST6GAL1/2) were knocked out. To specifically tune sialylation patterns on a secreted recombinant, C-terminally biotinylated, glycoprotein, specific sialyltransferases encoding expression vectors (pCDNA-ST3Gal4 and/or pCDNA-ST6Gal1) (Genscript, Piscataway, NJ, USA, NM_1254757.2; NM_173216.2) and an expression vector (pCD5) encoding a BirA biotin ligase65 were co-transfected with an expression vector coding for the extracellular domain of lysosomal membrane protein I (LAMP I) fused to a C-terminal biotinylation site. A codon optimized glycoprotein LAMP I ectodomain-encoding cDNA (Genscript, Piscataway, NJ, USA) was cloned in pCAGGS in frame with a C-terminal 2xStrep-tag followed by a biotin-acceptor peptide (BAP, GGLNDIFEAQKIEWH) for site specific biotinylation by BirA, allowing binding to streptavidin (SA) biosensors, and a 6xHis tag for purification using Ni-NTA beads. The HEKΔSia cells were seeded in cell culture flasks or 6-well plates in culture medium DMEM (Gibco), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Biowest), 10 U/ml of PEN-STREP (Lonza) and 2 mM Glutamax (Gibco) at 37 °C and 5% CO2 one day before transfection. Plasmids were transfected at different ratio’s (as indicated in the text) into HEKΔSia using polyethyleneimine I (PEI, Polysciences) as described23. Briefly, the transfection mixture containing DNA and PEI in 1:10 ratio were mixed rigorously and incubated 30 min at room temperature. The transfection mixture was added carefully (drop-by-drop) to cell culture flasks containing half-volume of cell culture medium without PEN-STREP. The biotinylated LAMP I was purified from cell culture supernatant 84 h after transfection according to standard protocols of Ni-NTA purification system (ThermoFisher Scientific K95001).Real time virus binding and lectin binding assays by Biolayer interferometry (BLI)Real time virus binding was studied by BLI analysis using an Octet RED348 (Fortebio). All experiments were carried out at 30 °C in Dulbecco’s PBS with Calcium and Magnesium (PBS + / + ) (Lonza) as standard assay buffer. Streptavidin (SA) biosensors were loaded with Sia receptors using biotinylated synthetic glycans that contain either α2-3 Sia, α2-6 Sia or no Sia with two LacNAc (N-acetyllactosamine [Galβ1-4GlcNAc]) repeats (referred to as 2-3S(LN)2, 2-6S(LN)2, and LN2 in this paper), or were loaded with specifically glycosylated recombinant glycoprotein LAMP I batches as indicated in the text. Receptors were loaded to densities indicated in the text or Figures. Different loading densities were obtained by loading a single receptor for different loading times and/or at different receptor concentrations. Receptor densities (loading levels) were determined from the BLI signal and plotted relatively to the BLI signal obtained at full loading. Alternatively, mixed receptor surfaces were obtained by mixing two or three receptors at the required ratios and loading the mixture to full occupation of the BLI SA-biosensor surfaces. Individual receptors were first exactly calibrated to each other on basis of their binding rate. Real time virus association was examined for 900 s by moving receptor-loaded biosensors to wells containing 100 ul virus sample in the presence of 10 µM Oseltamivir Carboxylate (OC; Roche) to block all NA activity23, 1 mM Protease inhibitor (Roche; 11836153001) and Trypsin-like proteases inhibitor (Sigma Aldrich; T6552). Virus initial binding rates were calculated from virus binding levels after 5 min (during which the binding curve is linear apart from the first few seconds). Initial binding rates were either plotted absolute (nm/109 virus particles) or relative to the maximum binding rate at full receptor density as indicated in the Figures. LAMP I sialylation levels were analyzed by lectin binding assays by incubation of receptor-loaded biosensors in lectin-containing wells (4 ug lectins/well) and recorded by BLI for 900 s to reach equilibrium lectin binding levels. Maackia amurensis lectin I (MAL I, Vector Labs) binds to α2-3Sia-Galβ1-4GlcNAc, Sambucus nigra lectin (SNA, Vector Labs) binds preferentially to α2-6Sia-Galβ1-4GlcNAc and Erythrina Cristagalli Lectin (ECA, Vector Labs) binds to terminal LacNAc (Galβ1-4GlcNAc).Infection and luciferase reporter assaysFor determining the virus infection efficiency in correlation to the binding properties determined by BLI, virus infection assays were applied in specifically sialylated HEKΔSia cells as described in the text. A luciferase reporter system66 employing the Gaussia luciferase encoding vector pHH-Gluc was used as described34 for performing a single-round entry assay. HEKΔSia cells were seeded in a 96-well plate (20.000 cells/ well) to reach 90% confluency the following day at which cells were cotransfected with 50 ng pHH-Gluc and a range of sialytransferases (ST3Gal4 and/or ST6Gal1) using Lipofectamine 2000 (InVitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The cell culture medium was replaced with Opti-mem (Gibco) 6 hr post transfection. After 48 h the transfected cells were infected at different MOIs as indicated in Figures. At 17 hr p.i. samples from the supernatant were assayed for luciferase activity using the Renilla Luciferase Assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The relative light units (RLU) were determined by GloMax Discover System GM3000 luminometer (Promega). To check effect on virus entry from knock-out of sialyltransferases, Sia-independent enterovirus strain RlucCVB3 genome replication was measured by intracellular Renilla luciferase activity. MOI = 0.1 of RlucCVB3 was used to infect HEK293 or HEKΔSia cells. Infected HEK293 and HEKΔSia cells were lysed at 8 hr p.i. and luciferase activity was measured following the manufacturer’s protocol (Renilla luciferase assay system; Promega).Quantification of Sia gradients by Flow cytometryHEKΔSia cells were seeded in 6-well plates (1.5E + 05 cells/well) and the next day cotransfected with a pEGFP reporter plasmid and different amounts and ratios of sialyltransferases (ST6Gal1 and/or ST3Gal4). After 48 h transfected cells were released using Cell Dissociation Buffer (Gibco), washed once in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS. Cells firstly were incubated with biotinylated-lectins (MAL I, Vector Labs; SNA, Vector labs) for 1 hr and then complexed with Streptavidin for 1 hr, (Alexa Fluor™ 568 conjugate (1 mg/mL),Thermo Fisher). Cells were analyzed on BC Cytoflex LX (Beckman) using CytExpert fot CtytoFLEX Acquisition and Analysis software. The gating methods are based on standard protocols67. Representative flow cytometry gating strategy for lectin staining cells are shown in Supplementary Fig. 7.Software and statistical analysisAll experiments were performed with n = 3, n = 4 or n = 6 biological replicates (as indicated). Each BLI binding assay was repeated at least twice, and binding signals of representative samples were the average of technical duplicates from the same sample. Virus initial binding rates, corresponding to the slopes of the binding curves during the first 5 min, were corrected by virus particle numbers and determined by Simple linear regression (GraphPad Prism 8.4.0). Statistical significance for bar diagram plots of virus binding or entry was determined using the unpaired t-test with Welch’s correction, applying two-tailed calculation on biological replicates (n is indicated in the figure legends) (GraphPad Prism 8.4.0). Fractional receptor densities correlating with half maximum initial binding rates were determined by non-linear regression analysis and performed by the Sigmoidal, 4PL, X is log (concentration) (GraphPad Prism 8.4.0). Each luciferase biological replicate is the average of technical triplicates from the same sample. Significance analysis of luciferase reporter assay was based on one way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons test (GraphPad Prism 8.4.0).Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.

Here, we compared the antigenicity of NAs from recently recommended H1N1 (2010–2021 seasons) and H3N2 (2015–2021 seasons) vaccine strains and viruses that circulated between September 2019 and December 2020. The antigenicity was evaluated by measuring NA ferret antisera titers that provide 50% inhibition of NA activity in an enzyme-linked lectin assay. Our results show that NAs from circulating H1N1 viruses and vaccine strains for the 2017–2021 seasons are all antigenically similar and distinct from the NA in the H1N1 strain recommended for the 2010–2017 seasons. Changes in N1 antigenicity were attributed to the accumulation of substitutions over time, especially the loss of an N-linked glycosylation site (Asn386) in current N1s. The NAs from circulating H3N2 viruses and the 2020–2021 vaccine strains showed similar antigenicity that varied across the N2s in the 2016–2020 vaccine strains and was distinct from the N2 in the 2015–2016 vaccine strain. These data suggest that the recent N1 antigenicity has remained similar since the loss of the head domain N-linked glycosylation site, whereas N2 antigenicity has changed more incrementally each season.

During the early trials individuals receiving this vaccine were found to generate antibodies capable of inhibiting the receptor binding function of the hemagglutinin (HA or H) antigen and this property was shown to correlate with protection from the vaccine3. Around the time hemagglutination-inhibition antibody titres became accepted as a correlate of protection, several studies began showing that antibodies against the less abundant neuraminidase (NA or N) antigen can also limit the severity of influenza infections in animals and humans4,5,6. However, establishing a correlate of protection and quantifying the content in vaccines have proven to be more difficult for NA than HA.Inactivated viruses are still the most common antigen source for influenza vaccines administered in the U.S7. The vaccine viruses are now produced in cells, as well as eggs, and the purification and inactivation processes have improved8,9,10. Most of the current viral-based influenza vaccines are also quadrivalent, containing HA and NA antigens from two recommended IAV and two recommended IBV strains11. One of the IAV strain is from the H1N1 subtype and the other is from the H3N2 subtype, whereas the two recommended IBV strains are from the Yamagata and Victoria lineages, respectively. To account for changes in circulating influenza viruses, the recommended vaccine strains are selected each season based on a combination of epidemiological, HA antigenicity and modelling data12. Efforts are then made to create high growth reassortant candidate vaccine viruses for cell and egg-based vaccines that possess a HA which is antigenically similar to the HA from the recommended strain.Despite the continuous strain evaluations and updates, influenza vaccine efficacy remains less than ideal13,14, suggesting influenza vaccines may benefit from the inclusion of other protective antigens. Consequently, NA is receiving more consideration as a second antigen for influenza vaccines, especially since NA antibodies can also provide cross protection against strains carrying HAs that are antigenically distinct from the vaccine15,16,17,18,19. However, NAs in vaccines are currently not selected, but rather a consequence of the pairing with a recommended HA in an available isolate. As a result, egg and cell-based vaccine strains for the same influenza virus subtype or lineage can contain NAs with different sequences and it is not clear if the changes can impact any potential protection from NA due to the general lack of antigenic data.Many recent studies have begun to use an immobilised enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA) to measure NA inhibition (NAI) antibody titres and to assess NA antigenicity20,21,22,23,24,25. The ELLA was first developed to examine NA activity and inhibition using erythrocyte glycoproteins as a substrate and agglutination by the galactose-binding lectin peanut agglutinin as a reporter26,27. This assay has since been modified and the glycans from bovine fetuin are used for measuring viral NA activity in the absence and presence of serum containing NA antibodies28,29,30,31,32. An advantage of the ELLA is that it can capture antibody-mediated interference of NA enzymatic activity33,34, which has been shown to correlate reasonably well with NA-mediated protection21,35. However, in recent years the analysis of H3N2 isolates by the ELLA has been very limited because these strains grow poorly in eggs36.In this study we compared the antigenicity of NA subtypes 1 (N1) and 2 (N2) from recently circulating IAVs and vaccine strains using ferret antisera coupled with ELLA. To eliminate the dependence on field isolates, the analysis was performed using reverse genetic viruses that carry the same HA with NAs from recent H1N1 and H3N2 vaccine strains and circulating strains that were prevalent between September 2019 and December 2020. Our results show that NAs from the circulating strains and the 2020–2021 recommended H1N1 and H3N2 vaccine strains are antigenically similar. They also demonstrated that the antigenicity in NAs from recent H1N1 2009 pandemic-like viruses abruptly changed upon the loss of an N-linked glycosylation site in the head domain (Asn386), and that N2 antigenicity appears to be changing more incrementally with each season. The benefit of combining bioinformatics and reverse genetics with the ELLA for evaluating NA antigens in current and future vaccine strains is discussed.ResultsChanges in virus NA content do not impact the enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA) resultsTo evaluate NA antigenicity, we combined reverse genetic viruses grown in embryonated chicken eggs with the standard ELLA approach for monitoring the inhibition of NA activity by ferret antisera31,32,37. The ELLA approach utilises glycans on immobilised bovine fetuin for the NA substrate, a horseradish peroxidase labelled galactose-binding protein (peanut agglutinin) as a reporter, and viruses for the NA source (Fig. 1). Initially, viruses are titrated in the ELLA to determine a dilution that produces signal in the linear range of the absorbance reading (Fig. 1, steps A1–A3). Ferret serum against a specific NA is then titrated and incubated with the virus at the predetermined concentration prior to performing the ELLA and calculating the reciprocal sera dilution that causes 50% inhibition of the NA activity, which is reported as the NAI titre (Fig. 1, steps B1–B3).Fig. 1: Illustration of the enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA) for comparing NA antigenicity.Step A1, viruses are titrated using fetuin-coated plates. Step A2, NA exposed galactose residues on the fetuin glycans are bound by peanut agglutinin linked to horseradish peroxidase (PNA-HRP). Step A3, PNA-HRP binding is determined using the substrate OPD and measuring the absorbance (Abs) at 490 nm. Step B1, Ferret antisera are titrated with a fixed virus dilution from the linear range and added to fetuin-coated plates and processed similarly for PNA-HRP binding (Step B2) and development (Step B3). NA inhibition (NAI) titres are determined by inversely plotting the NA activity data and calculating the reciprocal sera dilution that corresponds to the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50).Full size imageAlthough generating reverse genetic viruses eliminates the dependence on strain isolates and minimises the potential interference by antibodies against the inoculating strain HA38,39, NA content in the viruses are still likely to vary. Therefore, we initially compared the ELLA results from two purified reassortant viruses (PR8H1N1/BR18 and WSNH1N1/BR18) that possess different amounts of HA and NA antigens from the H1N1 strain A/Brisbane/02/2018 (Fig. 2a)25. Based on Coomassie stained gels (Fig. 2b), NA activities and hemagglutination unit (HAU) titres (Fig. 2c), the WSNH1N1/BR18 virus was estimated to contain ~2.5 times more NA and slightly less HA than the PR8H1N1/BR18 virus. Supporting these properties, NA-mediated release of WSNH1N1/BR18 from fetuin was faster than PR8H1N1/BR18, whereas the HA binding affinity was slightly less (Fig. 2d). The ELLA captured the ~2-fold higher NA content in the WSNH1N1/BR18 virus during the virus titration (Fig. 2e, left panel) and ferret antisera against N1-BR18 produced similar NAI titres (~800) for both viruses (Fig. 2e, right panel, and Table 1), confirming our experimental set-up accounts for changes in the viral NA content when the HAs are identical.Fig. 2: Changes in viral NA content do not alter the ELLA results.a Diagram of the PR8H1N1/BR18 and WSNH1N1/BR18 reassortant viruses. b Non-reduced Coomassie stained gel of purified PR8H1N1/BR18 and WSNH1N1/BR18 viruses (~5 µg).

Curves were generated with equal densities of immobilised fetuin and the indicated purified virus protein concentrations. HA binding was measured in the presence of 10 µM zanamivir to inhibit NA activity and calculate the apparent dissociation constant (Kdapp) for fetuin based on total viral protein concentrations. To follow NA-mediated release, biosensors with bound viruses were transferred to a well without zanamivir. e ELLA virus titrations for the PR8H1N1/BR18 and WSNH1N1/BR18 viruses (left panel) are displayed with the ferret α-N1-BR18 antisera titration data (right panel) used to calculate the NAI titre.

However, the recommended H3N2 strains for egg-based (A/Hong Kong/2671/2019) and cell-based (A/Hong Kong/45/2019) vaccines possess NAs that differ at positions 45 and 469 (Supplementary Fig. 2). Therefore, we generated ferret antiserum against one N1 vaccine antigen (N1-GD19) and the N2 antigens from the egg (N2-HK19e) and cell-based (N2-HK19c) vaccine strains. To minimise the potential for poor NA responses due to the low abundance in virions and the labile nature of NA40, each antiserum was produced by intranasal inoculation with a PR8 double gene reassortant virus that carries a HA subtype 6 (H6) and one of the NA vaccine antigens (Fig. 3a).Fig. 3: Characterisation of ferret antisera against the NAs in the 2020–2021 IAV vaccine strains.a Diagram for generating ferret antisera against the NA antigens (N1-GD19, N2-HK19e, and N2-HK19c) from the recommended egg and cell-based IAV vaccine strains for the 2020–21 northern hemisphere season. Ferret sera were collected 21 days post intranasal inoculation with PR8 double gene reassortant viruses carrying H6 and one of the vaccine strain NAs. b Specificity and reactivity of each ferret antiserum was assessed by the ELLA using PR8 single gene reassortant viruses that carry the IAV vaccine strain NAs. Representative data from a single analysis performed in duplicate are displayed. Source data are provided in the source data file.Full size imageSpecificity of the antisera was confirmed using PR8 single gene reassortant viruses containing the NA vaccine antigens. The N1-GD19 antiserum showed high reactivity with PR8N1-GD19, producing an NAI titre of ~4400, and minimal reactivity with viruses carrying the N2 vaccine antigens (Fig. 3b and Table 1). Antisera against N2-HK19e and N2-HK19c produced modest NAI titres of 140 and 310 for their respective matching strains and did not react with PR8N1-GD19 (Fig. 3b and Table 1). Interestingly, both N2 antiserum showed a bias for the matching N2 antigen (Table 1), suggesting residues 45 or 469 could be in an epitope recognised by NAI antibodies.Comparison of NAs from recent H1N1 viruses and the 2020–2021 H1N1 vaccine strainTo identify potential antigenic changes between NAs from circulating H1N1 IAVs and the 2020–2021 vaccine strain, NA sequences collected between September 1, 2019 and December 15, 2020 were compared to N1-GD19. A positional analysis showed that amino acid substitutions in the recent N1 sequences are more common in the stalk region than the enzymatic head domain (Fig. 4a), and that the substitutions generally involved a change to a specific amino acid (Fig. 4b). Mapping the prevalent substitution sites on a structure of the N1 head domain revealed that most are surface exposed. One of the sites (467) is positioned on the top of the tetramer, another (222) is near the active site, and several are located on the side and bottom of the tetramer where the head is linked to the stalk (Fig. 4c). The surface exposure and the proximity of at least one substitution to the NA active site, indicated that these common N1 substitutions could result in an antigenic change from N1-GD19.Fig. 4: Comparison of NAs from recent H1N1 viruses and the 2020–2021 vaccine strain.a Amino acid positional analysis displaying the number of recent N1 sequences that encode different amino acids from N1-GD19 at each position. N1 sequences were from human H1N1 IAVs collected between September 1, 2019 and December 15, 2020. Regions corresponding to the transmembrane (TM) domain, stalk and enzymatic head domain are indicated. b Bar graph displaying the prevalence of the amino acids in the recent N1 sequences that differ from N1-GD19 at each position.

Side (left) and bottom (right) views of the NA tetramer were generated using Pymol.Full size imageProtective epitopes in NA have been almost exclusively mapped to the head domain22,23,33,41,42. Therefore, we used this region to identify several recent N1s that are good candidates for an antigenic comparison to N1-GD19. Approximately 66% of N1 head domain sequences were either identical to N1-GD19, or possessed substitutions at 1, 2, 5, or 6 specific positions in the head domain (Supplementary Fig. 3a). For each of these substitution groups we identified N1s that contained the most common amino acid position changes (Supplementary Fig. 3b), generated PR8 reassortant viruses, and examined the reactivity to ferret antisera against N1-GD19. The NAI titres for the N1-GD19 ferret antiserum indicated that the four representative N1s are antigenically similar to N1-GD19 as only the N1 with six head domain substitutions (N1-NJ20) showed a lower (twofold reduction) in NAI titre (Table 2), suggesting the NA antigen in the H1N1 vaccine strain for the 2020–2021 season is a reasonable choice.Table 2 NAI titres for the indicated N1 reassortant viruses and antisera.Full size tableLoss of an N-linked glycan site altered the antigenicity of NAs in recent H1N1 vaccine virusesWhen we extended the antigenic comparison to NAs from the three preceding H1N1 vaccine viruses a distinct pattern emerged. All recent N1s displayed similar antigenicity to the NAs (N1-BR18 and N1-MI15) from the recommended H1N1 vaccine strains for the 2017–2020 seasons and very little similarity to the NA (N1-CA09) in the recommended H1N1 vaccine strain for the 2010–2017 seasons (Table 2). To determine if a specific substitution is responsible for the antigenic change, we compared the NA sequences from the four recent H1N1 vaccine strains (Supplementary Fig. 1) and focused on substitutions in the head domain that are unique for N1-CA09. Ten sites were found and one corresponded to an N-linked glycosylation site in N1-CA09 (N386) that was lost in N1-MI15, N1-BR18 and N1-GD19 (Fig. 5a), as it became less prevalent in strains isolated after 201323. Four of the sites mapped to distinct areas in the N1 head domain and the remaining six, including the glycosylation site substitution, clustered in three separate pairs (Fig. 5b).Fig. 5: Head substitutions contribute to the antigenic change in NAs from recent H1N1 vaccine strains.a Chart displaying the amino acid positions where N1-GD19, N1-BR18 and N1-MI15 all differ from N1-CA09 by the same amino acid.

NAI measurements were made in duplicate in two independent runs using PR8 single gene reassortant viruses carrying the indicated NAs. N1-BR18 and N1-MI15 controls were run once in duplicate. P values were determined using a one-way ANOVA Dunnett’s multiple comparison test with a 95% CI and N1-CA09 as the comparator. **P ≤ 0.01; ***P ≤ 0.001; ****P ≤ 0.0001. Source data for (c–f) are provided in the source data file.Full size imageThe identified substitutions were introduced into N1-CA09 individually, or in pairs, and PR8 single gene reassortant viruses were generated. Viruses carrying the 270 K/314 M, 386 K and 321 V/386 K substitutions all showed higher NAI titres with sera against N1-GD19, N1-BR18 and N1-MI15 (Fig. 5c–e), suggesting these substitutions contributed independently or additively to the antigenic change in the recent N1s. The largest single substitution antigenic change was from 386 K, which results in the loss of an N-linked glycosylation site in N1-CA09. The change was more pronounced with the addition of the 321 V substitution that is located beneath residue 386 in the structure, confirming that the potential glycosylation of N386 masks a viable NAI epitope that is recognised in ferrets. Despite the observed changes, none of the N1-CA09 variants showed the same reactivity as N1-GD19 with the sera against N1-GD19 or N1-BR18, indicating the antigenic difference between N1-CA09 and the recent N1s is due to a combination of the lost glycosylation site and other substitutions. Interestingly, none of the substitutions in N1-CA09 caused a loss of reactivity with serum against N1-CA09, suggesting the low reactivity of N1-GD19 is either due to multiple substitutions or the few substitutions we did not examine.NAs from recent H3N2 viruses and vaccine strains show more antigenic variabilityWe performed a similar analysis to determine if any potential antigenic changes exist between the NA sequences from recent H3N2 IAVs and the 2020–2021 vaccine strains. Due to the sequence differences, N2-HK19e and N2-HK19c were both used as references for the positional analysis. In contrast to N1, amino acid changes in recent N2s were common in the head domain (Fig. 6a). We also observed that the C-terminal residue of N2-HK19e (469 T) and the stalk residue of N2-HK19c (45 S) are not prevalent and that the amino acid differences in the recent N2s generally involved a change to a specific amino acid (Fig. 6b). Mapping on a structure of the N2 head domain showed that most substitutions correspond to surface exposed residues and that many of them are positioned around the active site and on the top of the tetramer near the central Ca2+ binding site (Fig. 6c), which has been shown to be critical for NA activity40.Fig. 6: Comparison of NAs from recent H3N2 viruses and the 2020–2021 vaccine strains.a Amino acid positional analysis displaying the number of recent N2 sequences that encode amino acids which differ from N2-HK19c (orange) and N2-HK19e (blue) at each position. N2 sequences were from human H3N2 IAVs isolated between September 1, 2019 and December 15, 2020. Amino acid positions corresponding to the TM domain, stalk and enzymatic head are indicated. b Bar graph displaying the prevalence of the amino acids in recent N2 sequences that differ from N2-HK19e and N2-HK19c at each position. Note N2-HK19e and N2-HK19c differ at positions 45 and 469. Only amino acids visible in the graph are listed. Asterisk indicates amino acids with little surface exposure. c Amino acid positions that differ in recent N2 sequences were highlighted (red) on a single monomer of a head domain tetramer (PDB ID: 4GZT)55. Asn residues (green) of the conserved N-linked glycosylation sites48, NA active site residues (yellow), and Ca2+ ions (pink) are also depicted. Positions 140 and 303 are not visible. Side (left) and bottom (right) views of the NA tetramer were generated using Pymol.Full size imageTo identify recent N2 sequences for the antigenic comparison to N2-HK19e and N2-HK19c we again focused on the head domain and found that very few sequences were identical to either N2-HK19e or N2-HK19c. Tabulating the most prevalent substitution combinations in the head domain (with respect to N2-HK19c) revealed that ~55% of the recent N2 sequences contain amino acid substitutions at 2, 4, 5, 6, or 10 specific positions in the head domain (Supplementary Fig. 4a). From this analysis eight N2s with the most common head domain substitution combinations were identified (Supplementary Fig. 4b). We then generated PR8 single gene reassortant viruses for all eight NAs and tested the reactivity to ferret antisera against N2-HK19e, N2-HK19c, and the NAs from the four preceding H3N2 vaccine strains.With the sera against N2-HK19e and N2-HK19c no significant decrease was observed between the NAI titres of the recent N2s and the vaccine strain matched N2s, indicating they all possess reasonable antigenic similarity (Table 3). Interestingly, all recent N2s that possessed the 469 T substitution showed higher reactivity with the sera against N2-HK19e than N2-HK19c, indicating the C-terminus is part of an antigenic domain for NAI antibodies in N2. For the serum against N2-KS17, only the N2 with 10 substitutions (N2-Que20) showed similar antigenicity, which was not surprising as the sequence is almost identical to N2-KS17 and they both displayed similar NAI titres with all sera that were often very high. The sera against N2-SG16 and N2-HK14 showed more variability as the NAI titres for some recent N2s were close to those for the matching vaccine strain N2s. For the serum against N2-SW13, the recent N2s displayed very little reactivity, indicating they are all antigenically distinct from the NA in the H3N2 vaccine strain for the 2015–2016 season. Together, these results imply that the NAs in the recent H3N2 viruses matched reasonably well to those in the 2020–2021 vaccine strains and that the antigenicity of recent N2s is more variable and less defined than the antigenicity of the recent N1s.Table 3 NAI titres from the indicated N2 reassortant viruses and antisera.Full size tableDiscussionDuring previous influenza seasons our lab has supported the influenza A vaccine strain selection process by using available isolates to evaluate circulating NA antigens. The isolate dependence severely impaired these evaluations because only a few H1N1 and almost no H3N2 strains were received, partly due to the poor growth of recent H3N2 strains in eggs. In addition, the few isolates we did obtain often arrived close to the February strain selection meeting and many carried NAs with identical sequences. To perform a more systematic evaluation of the NAs in circulating strains, we changed our strategy for the 2020–2021 season to a sequence-based approach that used reverse genetic viruses for the NA source. The results showed that the NA antigens in the recommended H1N1 and H3N2 strains for egg and cell-based vaccines for the 2020–2021 season are antigenically similar to the majority of NAs in the sequenced circulating H1N1 and H3N2 viruses. They also indicated that the loss of N-linked glycans and the C-terminus of N2 can potentially influence NA antigenicity. In contrast to prior seasons, these conclusions were based on data that covered ~66% of the H1N1 strains and ~55% of the H3N2 strains that were collected between September 2019 and December 2020. As this platform is expanded, we envisage that it will aid in the selection of NA antigens for recombinant protein- and mRNA-based vaccines, and in the selection between vaccine strains that carry similar HAs but different NAs.By including sera against NAs from prior vaccine strains we were able to observe a clear difference in the antigenicity of NAs from recent H1N1 strains as they reacted well with all sera except for that against N1-CA09. One of the main contributors to the antigenic change was the loss of an N-linked glycosylation site (Asn386) that was present on N1-CA09, supporting a prior study that inferred this site can influence N1 antigenicity based on a comparison of NAs from H1N1 strains isolated between 2009 and 201623. We showed that the reactivity further enhanced when it was combined with a second substitution (321) that has little surface exposure and is largely located under residue 386 in the structure. Another antigenic site included residues 270 and 314, which are on the opposing face of the monomer in a region that has been shown to be recognised by both mouse and human NAI antibodies33,43. While this suggests these two sites (386 and 270/314) could be independent NAI epitopes, it does not rule out the possibility that the 270/314 substitutions have an additive effect on a distal epitope that is masked by the glycan at Asn386. Glycan masking has been reported for numerous antigens including NA44,45,46,47, making it interesting that the N1-CA09 serum failed to recognise the more recent N1s lacking the N-linked glycosylation site. The N1-CA09 serum reactivity was also not impaired by any of the N1 substitutions found in the later vaccine strains, suggesting that the NAI epitopes in N1-CA09 require multiple substitutions to be disrupted.More antigenic variability was observed in the NAs from the recent H3N2 strains as every serum reacted with at least one N2 at a level that was similar to the N2 used to generate the sera. There also was no clear temporal distinction as some recent N2s showed more reactivity with sera against N2-HK14 and N2-SG16 than N2-KS17. The data for the N2s from the egg and cell-based vaccine strains also revealed that the C-terminus of N2 can influence an antigenic domain for NAI antibodies. This interpretation, which suggests the cell-based N2 with 469 I is a slightly better antigenic match for circulating H3N2 strains, was based on the reproducible bias of the two antisera for N2s with an identical C-terminus and previous work demonstrating the amino acid at position 468 can influence NAI titres for N244. Interestingly, the N2 C-terminus is near the central Ca2+-binding site that was previously shown to be crucial for N1 enzymatic activity40, raising the possibility that antibody binding decreases the Ca2+ affinity of this site, thereby reducing N2 activity. Although more directed studies are needed to determine the precise mechanism of inhibition, these observations indicate the N2 C-terminus should receive some consideration during H3N2 strain selection. This especially applies to the 2021–22 season where the recommended H3N2 vaccine strains carry a NA with a C-terminal N-linked glycosylation site at position 463, which is distinct from the reported variable glycosylation sites in N248 and had little data demonstrating its prevalence at the time of strain selection.There are still some significant deficiencies in the ELLA-based antigenic characterisation of NA. The most striking are the false positive NAI titres that are obtained from antibodies against HA38,39, the time consuming nature of the assay, and the significantly lower NAI titres that are obtained for N2 compared to N1, resulting in a smaller dynamic range for evaluating N2. Despite these deficiencies, systematic approaches are likely the most effective way for evaluating antigenic drift in NA and the current ELLA has been shown to correlate reasonably well with protection in humans21,35. However, it is still unclear how well naïve ferrets model NA epitope recognition by humans or how valuable sera from vaccinated individuals is for assessing NA responses due to the limited NA content in approved vaccines and the potential influence of the manufacturing process on the antigenicity of this labile protein. Future studies and modifications to address these deficiencies will improve this approach for evaluating NA antigenicity and increase the likelihood that NAs in circulating viruses are evaluated as thoroughly as the HA antigens during the vaccine selection process.MethodsReagentsMadin-Darby canine kidney 2 cells (MDCK.2; CRL-2936) and HEK 293 T/17 cells (CRL-11268) were purchased from LGC Standards.

RG plasmids encoding N1-CA09 with single and double point mutations were generated by site directed mutagenesis (Agilent). All RG plasmids were confirmed by sequencing before use (FDA core facility).Cell culture, reverse genetics and viral propagationMDCK.2 and HEK 293 T/17 cells were maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and ~95% humidity in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 100 U/ml P/S. Reassortant viruses were created by 8-plasmid RG51 in 6-well plates using the indicated NA, or NA and HA pair, and the complimentary seven, or six, PR8 gene segments. The day before each well received ~2 × 106 293 T and ~1 × 106 MDCK.2 cells. Eight plasmids (1 µg of each) were added to 200 μl of OMEM, mixed with 18 µl of lipofectamine, and incubated 45 min at room temperature. Wells were washed with 2 ml OMEM, mixtures were added to each well and incubated 5 min at 37 °C prior to adding 800 μl of OMEM. At 24 h post-transfection 1 ml OMEM containing 4 µg/ml TPCK trypsin was added to each well. Culture medium containing the rescued viruses was harvested ~96 h post-transfection and clarified by sedimentation (2000 × g; 5 min) prior to being used to inoculate 10-day old embryonic SPF chicken eggs (100 μl per egg). Eggs were incubated for 3 days at 33 °C, placed at 4 °C for 2 h, the allantoic fluid was collected, clarified by centrifugation (2000 × g; 5 min), aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. For purification, viruses in allantoic fluid were inactivated with 0.05% BPL for ~16 h at 4 °C. Prior to use each viral stock was confirmed using MiSeq RNA deep sequencing (FDA core facility).Viral purification and SDS-PAGEBPL inactivated PR8H1N1-BR18 and WSNH1N1-BR18 reassortant viruses were purified from allantoic fluid by ultracentrifugation25. Viruses were isolated by sedimentation (100,000 × g; 45 min) at 4 °C through a 5 ml sucrose cushion (25% w/v sucrose, PBS pH 7.2 and 1 mM CaCl2). Pelleted viruses were resuspended in 500 µl sucrose 12.5% w/v in PBS pH 7.2 containing 1 mM CaCl2, layered on top of a discontinuous sucrose gradient with four 8.5 ml sucrose layers (60% w/v, 45% w/v, 30% w/v and 15% w/v in PBS pH 7.2 and 1 mM CaCl2) and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 2 h at 4 °C. Fractions with a density between 30 and 50% sucrose w/v were pooled, mixed with 2 volumes of PBS pH 7.2 and 1 mM CaCl2, and centrifuged (100,000 × g; 45 min). The supernatant was discarded, sedimented viruses were resuspended in PBS pH 7.2 containing 1 mM CaCl2, protein concentration was determined using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) and adjusted to a concentration of 1 mg/ml using PBS pH 7.2 containing 1 mM CaCl2, aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. For SDS-PAGE, purified viruses (~5 µg total viral protein) were mixed with 2× sample buffer, heated at 50 °C for 5 min and resolved on a 4–12% polyacrylamide Tris-Glycine SDS-PAGE wedge gel. Gels were stained with simple blue and imaged with an Azure C600 Bioanalytical Imaging System (Azure Biosystems).Bio-layer interferometryBiotinylated fetuin was made using the EZ-Link NHS-PEG4-Biotinylation kit (Thermo Scientific). Briefly, bovine fetuin (Sigma) was dissolved in PBS pH 7.2 to a concentration of 10 mg/ml and incubated with 2.9 mM of the biotinylation reagent at room temperature for 60 min. Biotinylated fetuin was then isolated using an Agilent 1260 Infinity II HPLC equipped with a 21.2 × 300 mm AdvanceBio SEC 300 Å column, a variable wavelength detector and PBS 7.2 as the mobile phase. Fractions containing fetuin were pooled, the protein concentration was determined using BCA, and the labelling was calculated to be ~8 biotin/molecule of fetuin. Binding of the purified BPL inactivated PR8H1N1-BR18 and WSNH1N1-BR18 viruses to immobilised biotinylated fetuin was performed using a ForteBio Octet Red96 bio-layer interferometer equipped with ForteBio High Precision Streptavidin biosensors at 25 °C with a plate shaking speed of 1000 rpm. Baselines were established for 2 min in 200 μl of buffer (PBS pH 7.2 containing 1 mM CaCl2 and 0.005% Tween20) prior to and post incubation of biosensors with 200 μl of 10 nM biotinylated fetuin for 10 min. Fetuin loaded biosensors were then transferred to wells containing 200 μl of the indicated concentrations of the WSNH1N1-BR18 or PR8H1N1-BR18 viruses in buffer with 10 μM zanamivir for 30 min to analyse HA-mediated virus association. Biosensors were then transferred to new wells containing 200 μl of buffer for 20 min to examine NA-mediate dissociation.NA activity and HAU measurementsNA activity measurements were performed using equal amounts of total viral protein in 96-well low protein binding black clear bottom plates (Corning)25. Each virus was mixed with 37 °C reaction buffer (0.1 M KH2PO4 pH 6.0 and 1 mM CaCl2) to a volume of 195 μl. Reactions were then initiated by adding 5 μl of 2 mM MUNANA and the fluorescence was measured on a Cytation 5 (Biotek) plate reader at 37 °C for 10 min using 30 s intervals with 365 nm excitation and 450 nm emission wavelengths. Activities were determined by calculating the slope of the early linear region of the emission versus time graph. HAU titres were determined by twofold serial dilutions in 96-well plates with a sample volume of 50 µl. Following dilution in PBS pH 7.2, 50 µl of 0.5% TRBCs were added to each well and incubated 30 min at room temperature. HAU titres corresponded to the last well where agglutination was observed.Ferret inoculation and serum collectionAll animal experiments were approved by the U.S. FDA Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee under Protocol #2001-05. The animal care and use protocol meets National Institutes of Health guidelines. Intranasal inoculations were performed on 14 week-old male ferrets using allantoic fluid that contained the indicated reassortant virus at an infectious titre between 106 and 108 TCID50/ml on MDCK cells. The inoculum (~0.5 ml) was equally dispensed between both nostrils of the anaesthetised ferret using a 1 ml syringe equipped with a 20 Gauge feeding needle. Ferret temperatures, monitored using an implanted microchip, and body weight were recorded daily for 2 weeks. The sera was harvested 3 weeks post-infection, aliquoted and stored at −80 °C.ELLA and NAI titre determinationThe ELLA was performed in two parts on 96-well Maxisorp plates coated with 2.5 µg/well of bovine fetuin31. Briefly, correct virus concentrations for the ELLA were first determined using twofold serial dilutions of each virus. The dilution series was added to fetuin-coated plates and incubated at 37 °C overnight. Plates were washed and incubated with ~100 ng/well of horse radish peroxidase-linked peanut agglutinin (PNA-HRP) for 2 h at room temperature. Plates were washed again and developed with OPD (0.5 ng/well) for 10 min, the reaction was stopped with 100 µl/well 1 N sulfuric acid and the absorbance at 490 nm was measured. Absorbance was plotted versus the virus dilution and the dilution corresponding to the top of the linear part of the titration curve was chosen. Next, a twofold dilution series was made for each antiserum and transferred to a fetuin-coated plate prior to adding the virus at the concentration determined in the first assay. Plates were incubated at 37 °C overnight, washed, incubated with PNA-HRP and developed as described above. The absorbance for each antiserum and virus pair was background corrected using the average signal obtained from wells containing no virus or serum. To calculate the NAI percentage each background corrected sample signal was subtracted from the average virus control well signal (wells that received virus but no antiserum) and the difference was divided by the average virus control well signal and multiplied by 100%. The NAI percentage was then plotted versus the reciprocal dilution of the antiserum in GraphPad Prism 8.0 and the IC50 value, which corresponds to the NAI titre, was determined by a four-parameter least squares fit analysis.Sequence analysisThe available NA protein sequences collected from human H1N1 (N = 6844) and H3N2 (N = 5566) viruses since September 1, 2019 were downloaded from the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database on December 15, 2020. Sequences longer or shorter than 469 amino acids were excluded along with those that contained ambiguous amino acid identities. All analyses were performed based on positions in the N1 or N2 amino acid sequences using the indicated vaccine NA sequence as a reference. Results specific for the head domain were obtained by examining the residues corresponding to amino acids 82–469, excluding the stalk and transmembrane domain52,53.Statistical analysisStatistical analysis was performed with GraphPad Prism 8 software with the assumptions that the data follows a Gaussian distribution. Student’s unpaired t-test was performed using a two-tailed analysis and a confidence interval (CI) of 95%. One-way ANOVA was performed using Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test with a CI of 95%.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.

We found a significant increase in influenza prevalence in both children (≤ 19 years old) and adults (≥ 20 years old) over time. The influenza prevalence was higher in children (0.33 [95% CI 0.26–0.40]) than in adults (0.09 [95% CI 0.07–0.11]). Additionally, the mean prevalence of antibodies for A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) was significantly higher in children than in adults, whereas the mean prevalence of antibodies for B lineages was relatively low in both children and adults. There was a biennial cycle of the epidemic peak in children, which was associated with a relatively higher prevalence of B lineages. The female-to-male ratios of the influenza prevalence were significantly different in children (≤ 19 years old; 1.10 [95% CI:1.08–1.13]), adults (20–59 years old; 0.79 [95% CI 0.75–0.82]), and older adults (≥ 60 years old; 1.01 [95% CI 0.97–1.04]). The significant increase in influenza prevalence throughout the study period suggests a change of immunity to influenza infection. Long-term surveillance is important for developing a strategy to monitor, prevent and control for influenza epidemics.

In Japan, the usual influenza epidemic starts around the beginning of January and peaks within a few weeks5,6,7,8. The influenza epidemic curve in Japan shows exponential growth toward the peak week and immediately decreases thereafter. This recurrent pattern has been also found in other respiratory viruses, such as the COVID-19 epidemic, in winter9. Furthermore, the spread of the epidemic is similarly located in regions over time for different predominant influenza viruses8. For example, during the pandemic caused by the novel swine influenza variant A(H1N1)pdm in 2009, epidemic clustering and transmission similar to that of seasonal influenza was observed8,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17. This event highlighted the importance of understanding epidemic trends to estimate the risk of an epidemic. Similarly, continuous and long-term surveillance is important for the prevention of and preparation against emerging and re-emerging influenza epidemics5,18. In Japan, influenza surveillance has been conducted across the country by local health centres and public health institutes and infectious disease surveillance centres of the prefectural governments under the guidelines of the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare. Surveillance was widely expanded in the 1980s, with an increased number of sentinel clinics that report the weekly number of outpatient incident cases5.In this study, we analyzed the recent trends of influenza epidemics, including the age- and sex-related prevalence and the seasonal predominant virus with respect to the prevalence of influenza antibodies, using national surveillance data obtained between 2006 and 2016 in Japan.MethodsSurveillance dataWe used national influenza surveillance data for Japan from 2006 to 2016, thereby covering a period spanning from the 2005–2006 influenza season to the 2015–2016 influenza season5. The surveillance data were collected at 5000 sentinel clinics across Japan (approximately 3000 paediatric clinics and 2000 clinics of general practitioners for adults)5. The number of sentinel clinics was decided according to the population size of the administrative sector of the local health centres, making the surveillance similar nationwide. The majority of sentinel clinics have been settled, and neither the number and location of the sentinel clinics in the surveillance system nor the estimated coverage of the population by the sentinel clinics changed much over this time. In addition, the population coverage of sentinel clinics was similar for children and adults (from the estimated total population coverage by sentinel clinics and calculated from the coverage percentage of sentinel clinics within all medical clinics in Japan [Supplementary Table S1]).During influenza surveillance, physicians report incident cases to the local health centre via fax according to the clinical diagnosis for influenza-like illnesses (ILIs). The diagnosis of ILI by a physician is usually made using a rapid diagnostic testing kit for patients who presented with any of the four major symptoms of ILI (high fever, sudden illness onset, upper respiratory inflammation, and generalized symptoms such as malaise). Local health centres report the weekly number of incident cases to the prefectural public health institutes or infectious disease surveillance centres, which are responsible for entering the incident cases (sex and age group [0–5 months, 6–11 months, and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10–14, 15–19, 20–29, 30–39, 40–59, and over 60 years of age]) in the online database of the National Epidemiological Surveillance of Infectious Diseases (NESID), National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID)6. The epidemiologic period spans from July to June (comprising the influenza epidemic period of January to March). The NESID data are available online on the NIID website6. For the observed timeframe, pathogen surveillance was conducted using polymerase chain reactions (PCR)7 of nasal swab specimens collected in approximately 10% of patients with ILI across the country. PCR for virus testing were conducted at the prefectural public health institute or NIID, and the results were uploaded onto the NIID website6,7.Separately, surveillance for serum antibodies against each influenza virus subtype and strain was conducted at designated hospitals across the country using the hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay19. Samples of the serology surveillance were randomly collected from approximately 6000 Japanese individuals each year. We compared the influenza prevalence rate and the prevalence rate of serum influenza virus antibody.Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS version 21 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). The level of significance was set to 5%.Time-series analysis of the influenza prevalence rate and predominant virusWe calculated the yearly influenza prevalence rate, which is the rate of total ILI cases within the estimated coverage population by sentinel clinics, for each age group (0–5, 6–14, 15–19, 20–29, 30–39, 40–59, and ≥60 years). The estimated coverage population by sentinel clinics was calculated for each age group using the national census data in 2010 as the coverage percentage of sentinel clinics within the total medical clinics (paediatric clinics for estimating the sentinel population coverage of children [≤ 19 years of age] and clinics of general practitioners for adults for estimating the sentinel population coverage of adults [≥ 20 years of age], Supplementary Table S1). To assess the time-series trends of the prevalence rate, we fitted a linear regression model for the influenza prevalence rate and time (season) in children (≤ 19 years of age) and adults (≥ 20 years of age).We compared the influenza prevalence with the predominant epidemic influenza virus. We calculated the prevalence rate of each epidemic influenza virus within the total number of isolates and used Pearson’s correlation coefficient to assess the association between the influenza prevalence rate and the prevalence of each virus subtype and lineage. After observing the low- and high-prevalence seasons, we compared the influenza prevalence rate and the prevalence of each virus subtype and strain between these seasons using non-paired t-tests.Influenza antibody trendsMost samples in the serology surveillance for influenza antibody testing were collected between July and September each year to assess the results before vaccination for the epidemic season. For example, in 2009, approximately 75% of samples were collected between July and September, 15% were collected between April and June, and 10% were collected between October and December. This surveillance was carried out to estimate the epidemic level in the upcoming epidemic season. Thus, by using the predicted predominant virus strain in the upcoming epidemic season (which was also selected for the vaccine virus for the upcoming epidemic season), influenza antibody testing was implemented. (Of note, influenza vaccinations were conducted starting in November each year including 2009.) The HAI assay was conducted at all 47 prefectural public health institutes or the NIID, and the results were uploaded onto the NIID website6.The virus subtypes and strains for the HAI assay were selected according to the vaccine virus subtypes and strains for the year: A(H1N1) subtype [A(H1N1)pdm09 subtype from 2009 onwards], A(H3N2) subtype, and the B lineage of the selected vaccine subtypes and strains, plus another B lineage that was not selected for the vaccine. We calculated the average prevalence with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for an influenza antibody titer ≥ 1:40, which is considered sufficient to prevent infection19, by age group using the data of serology surveillance between 2006 and 20166,7 for five influenza virus: A(H1N1), A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), B/Yamagata-lineage, and B/Victoria-lineage. The difference in the prevalence of influenza antibody between children (≤ 19 years old) and adults (≥ 20 years old) was assessed using paired t-tests for each influenza virus. For multiple comparisons, the P value was corrected by Bonferroni’s correction. To assess the relationship between the previous infection and the prevalence of antibodies, Pearson’s correlation between the prevalence rate of the predominant virus strain and the prevalence of antibodies in children and adults was calculated separately.Sex ratio of the influenza prevalence rateWe compared the sex ratio (female-to-male ratio) of the influenza prevalence rate by age groups. We also compared the difference in sex ratios among children (≤ 19 years old), adults (20–59 years old), and older adults (≥ 60 years old) using a one-way ANOVA. For multiple comparisons, the P value was corrected using Bonferroni’s correction.Ethical approvalAll methods were performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations.ResultsInfluenza prevalence and predominant virusThe influenza prevalence rate was relatively higher in children aged 0–5 and 6–14 years old. The influenza prevalence rate in children younger than 20 years old was highest during the 2009–2010 season with the emergence of the novel swine influenza virus A(H1N1)pdm09 (Fig. 1a,b). There was no obvious peak of the influenza prevalence rate observed in age groups older than 30 years old during the 2009–2010 season. The age group 20–29 years old exhibited a relatively small increase in the influenza prevalence rate in the 2009–2010 season (Fig. 1a). The average influenza prevalence rate was 0.33 (95% CI 0.26–0.40) in children (≤ 19 years old) and 0.09 (95% CI 0.07–0.11) in adults (≥ 20 years old). (The number of raw incident cases by year is shown in Supplementary Table S2).Figure 1Influenza prevalence rate by age group and predominant virus. (a) Prevalence rate by age group according to reports from national sentinel clinics for each season. The base population was calculated using data from the national census in 2010. The 2005–2006 season comprised only data between January and June 2006 (due to data availability). (b) Prevalence of cases attributable to each epidemic virus subtype and strain (concerning B lineages, the prevalence of unspecified B lineages was distributed for the ratio of the B/Victoria and B/Yamagata lineages in each season).Full size imageThe influenza prevalence rate gradually increased over time in both children and adults (Fig. 2a,b, and Supplementary Tables S3 ). In a linear regression model, the relationship between the influenza prevalence rate and time (season) was significant in both children (P = 0.036) and adults (P = 0.001; Fig. 2a,b).Figure 2Linear regression model for seasonal influenza prevalence rate. A single linear regression model for the seasonal influenza prevalence rate in (a) children (≤ 19 years old) and (b) adults (≥ 20 years old). f(x) represents the prevalence rate, and X represents the number of seasons after the 2004–2005 season. For children, the seasons in which A(H1N1)pdm09 emerged (between the 2009–2010 and 2011–2012 seasons) were excluded from the regression model.Full size imageAfter the 2009–2010 season, the A(H1N1) subtype was replaced by the A(H1N1)pdm09 subtype, which became the predominant strain almost biennially (Fig. 1b, and Supplementary Table S4). The prevalence of the A(H1N1) subtype (and the A(H1N1)pmd09 subtype from 2009 onwards) was relatively high when that of the A/H3N2 subtype was relatively low (Fig. 1b, and Supplementary Table S4). A significant negative correlation was observed between the prevalence rates of A(H1N1) and A(H1N1)pmd09 (2009 onwards) and of A(H3N2) (r = − 0.89, P < 0.01; Fig. 1b, and Supplementary Table S4).Among the B lineages, B/Victoria was predominant over the B/Yamagata in most seasons (except the 2007–2008, 2012–2013, 2013–2014, and 2015–2016 seasons). The prevalence of the B/Yamagata-lineage increased gradually in most recent seasons. Epidemic peaks in the influenza prevalence rate in children appeared biennially, except for the 2009–2010 season (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Table S4). This biennial peak of the influenza prevalence rate in children coincided with an increase in the prevalence of influenza B lineages (B/Victoria and B/Yamagata lineages, excluding epidemic seasons with emergence of the novel swine flu virus [between the 2009–2010 and 2011–2012 seasons]; Fig. 3a). There was a significant positive correlation between the influenza prevalence rates in children and the prevalence of the B lineages (r = 0.66, P < 0.05, excluding epidemic seasons with emergence of the novel swine flu virus [between the 2009–2010 and 2011–2012 seasons]). In children, the influenza prevalence rate increased significantly during high-prevalence seasons (50%, P = 0.038; Fig. 3b) in association with a significant increase (185%, P = 0.002; Fig. 3b) in the prevalence of B lineages compared with the results in low-prevalence seasons. There was no biennial peak in the influenza prevalence in adults (≥ 20 years of age; Fig. 1a).Figure 3Biennial cycle of influenza virus B lineages and influenza prevalence rate in children (≤ 19 years old). (a) Biennial cycle of increased influenza prevalence rates in children and the prevalence of B lineages (the data exclude epidemic seasons during which the novel swine influenza virus emerged [between the 2009–2010 and 2011–2012 seasons], as indicated by the dotted lines). (b) Average influenza prevalence rate in children and average prevalence of B lineages for the low-prevalence period (Season A: 2005–2006, 2007–2008, 2012–2013, and 2014–2015 seasons) and high-prevalence period (Season B: 2006–2007, 2011–2012, 2013–2014, and 2015–2016 seasons).Full size imageInfluenza antibody prevalenceOverall, in all age groups, the prevalence rates of serum antibody (HAI titers ≥ 1:40) did not largely change over time (Fig. 4). The prevalence rates of serum antibodies were relatively low in children 0–5 years old for all influenza A subtypes and B lineages. The mean prevalence rates of antibodies against both A(H1N1) and A(H1N1)pdm09 were relatively higher in the age groups of 6–14, 15–19, and 20–29 years old (Fig. 4). Similarly, the prevalence rates of antibodies against the A/H3N2 subtype were relatively higher in the age groups of 6–14, 15–19, and 20–29 years old. The prevalence of antibodies against A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) increased slightly in most age groups over time. For the B/Victoria-lineage, all age groups displayed a relatively low prevalence of antibodies over time. The prevalence of antibodies against the B/Yamagata-lineage was relatively higher in the age groups of 15–19 and 20–29 years old but not in those of 6–14 years old (mean prevalence rate, 0.37 [95% CI 0.29–0.45]) or in other age groups (Fig. 4). Supplementary Table S5 lists the vaccine virus used for the HAI assay.Figure 4Yearly prevalence rate of hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titers (≥ 1:40) for the influenza virus by age group. Prevalence rate of serum antibodies against influenza virus strains by age group presented for titers ≥ 1:40, as measured in approximately 6000 people in Japan each year using the HAI assay. In (a), the prevalence rate of serum antibodies against A(H1N1) is presented for years between 2006 and 2008, and the prevalence rate of serum antibodies against A(H1N1)pdm09 is presented for years between 2009 and 2016, although the subtypes of A(H1N1) and A(H1N1)pdm09 were genetically different.Full size imageOn average, the mean prevalence of antibodies for A(H1N1)pdm09 was significantly higher (P < 0.001) in children (0.57 [95% CI 0.51–0.64]) than in adults (0.45 [95% CI 0.34–0.55]; Supplementary Fig. S1, and Table S6), as too was the mean prevalence of antibodies for A(H3N2) (P = 0.001; in children: 0.44 [95% CI 0.35–0.54]; in adults: 0.35 [95% CI 0.25–0.45]). The mean prevalence of antibodies for B/Victoria-lineage was significantly lower (P = 0.001) in children (0.25 [95% CI 0.18–0.32]) than in adults (0.32 [95% CI 0.25–0.40]) (Supplementary Fig. S1). For the B/Yamagata-lineage, the mean prevalence of antibodies was similar (P = 0.391) between children (0.36 [95% CI 0.30–0.42]) and adults (0.37 [95% CI 0.31–0.44]). There was no correlation between the prevalence rate of the predominant virus strain and the prevalence of antibodies in children or adults.Sex ratio of the influenza prevalence rate according to age groupThe female-to-male ratio of the influenza prevalence was consistent over time. Figure 5 presents the average sex ratio for the influenza prevalence rate, and Supplementary Fig. S2 presents the influenza prevalence rate by season, sex, and age group.Figure 5Sex ratio of the influenza prevalence rate by age group. Average female-to-male ratio in the influenza prevalence rate in each age group.Full size imageIn children, the difference of the influenza prevalence rate between girls and boys was largest in those aged 15–19 years (1.17 [95% CI 1.12–1.21]). In adults, the difference of the influenza prevalence rate between women and men was largest in those aged 30–39 years (0.68 [95% CI 0.65–0.71]; Fig. 5). On average, the sex ratio for the influenza prevalence rate was opposite between children and adults; specifically, the sex ratio for the influenza prevalence rate was 1.10 (95% CI 1.08–1.13) in children (≤ 19 years of age) and 0.79 (95% CI 0.75–0.82) in adults (20–59 years of age). In older adults (≥ 60 years old), there was no difference in the influenza prevalence rate between women and men (1.01 [95% CI 0.97–1.04]). The sex ratios among children, adults, and older adults were significantly different according to a one-way ANOVA (children vs. adults: P < 0.001; children vs. older adults: P = 0.001; adults vs. older adults: P < 0.001).DiscussionWe found that the prevalence rate of influenza in children in Japan remained relatively high compared with adults, which is in line with former studies20. The estimated average influenza prevalence rates were 0.33 in children and 0.09 in adults. In our recent study using claims-based data, the influenza prevalence rate in adults (≥ 30 years old) between 2005 and 2010 was 0.09 (95% CI 0.06–0.11), which was the same as that in the present study21. Although the predominant influenza virus varied by year, including the seasons in which the A(H1N1)pdm09 subtype emerged, the sex ratio of the influenza prevalence rate was consistent among all age groups. We also found a significant increase in the influenza prevalence in both children (≤ 19 years old) and adults (≥ 20 years old) over time. The reason for this increase is unknown; however, the results suggest a change in immunity to seasonal influenza infection. Because the mean prevalence of antibodies for B lineages was relatively low in both children and adults, one factor may be the increase of predominant B lineages, especially the B/Yamagata-lineage. Prevention with respect to these epidemic trends, such as improved vaccination, i.e. matching the vaccine strain and timeliness, as well as meeting a sufficient rate of vaccination coverage for age and sex groups with a higher rate of prevalence, should be sought4.Although the serum antibody prevalence rates against the vaccine strains were relatively low in adults (except those aged 20–29 years), the influenza prevalence rate in adults was lower than in children. This observation may indicate the existence of immunity in adults from previous infection by different virus subtypes and strains22,23,24,25. Similarly, there was no increase in the influenza prevalence rate in adults during the emergence of the A(H1N1)pdm09 subtype, suggesting that adults may have protective immunity against this subtype. Conversely, the results suggested that children are more susceptible to emergent virus subtypes and strains. The relatively higher prevalence of antibodies against A(H1N1)pdm09 could be attributed to the timing of the sample collection for the HAI assay in 2009, which occurred after the epidemic wave of A(H1N1)pdm09 started in August26. Considering the timing of the serum sampling, which mostly occurred before vaccination for the upcoming epidemic season, the observed prevalence of antibodies is thought to be derived from natural infection in the previous epidemic season; the increase in the prevalence of antibodies against A(H1N1)pdm09 over time may suggest residual antibodies from previous influenza infections. Although the HAI assay was conducted for vaccine virus strains, further data on antibodies using the Enzyme-Linked Immuno Sorbent Assay and whole influenza virus for antibody testing should be considered27. Additionally, our data of serum influenza antibodies included no information regarding the individual vaccination status.National surveillance data for influenza over a long period, including data for age, sex, predominant virus subtypes and strains, and serum antibodies, are relatively limited17. Regarding the predominant virus subtypes, it has been found in many countries that after 2009 the A(H1N1) subtype was replaced by the A(H1N1)pdm09 subtype25,26,27,28,29,30. Meanwhile, our study illustrated that the prevalence of serum antibodies against influenza viruses was relatively low in children (0–5 years old), including antibodies against both the B/Yamagata and B/Victoria lineages. The biennial increase in the influenza prevalence rate in children in Japan during the study period appears attributable to epidemics caused by B lineage viruses. After 2010, the B/Yamagata-lineage has predominated over the B/Victoria lineage globally (e.g., Africa, Latin America, Europe)25,31,32,33,34,35. In some countries, the number of infections by B lineage strains was increased in children35. Similarly, in Japan, the prevalence of the B/Yamagata-lineage has been increasing over time.In Japan, current influenza vaccination coverage is estimated at approximately 80% in school-age children and 50% in older adults36,37. Despite this relatively high vaccination coverage, the prevalence rate of influenza has remained similar over time, including a relatively high influenza prevalence rate in children. Therefore, further research to match vaccine virus strains with the predominant epidemic virus strains and increase the effectiveness of vaccinations in each season is needed, particularly with respect to B lineages36,37,38,39,40.Both the incidence surveillance and serology surveillance were based on data collected from the outpatients, and thus, the data may have reflected healthcare-seeking or vaccination behavior or accessibility to testing in children and adults. However, concerning differences in the influenza prevalence rate by age and sex, previous studies (such as those in Australia and Germany) reported findings similar to those in our study, including higher incidence rates in male children than in female children and higher incidence rates in female adults than in male adults41,42,43,44,45. Differences in incidence according to age and sex are thought to correspond to the immune status46. For example, women of reproductive age may have a stronger inflammatory response to infection than men of that age; thus, the rates of hospitalization for influenza infection may be higher in women than in men46,47.The surveillance of all infectious diseases was consolidated in Japan over decades and operated at the level of sentinel clinics to all clinic networks based on the surveillance disease category under the Infectious Disease Law5. Furthermore, the surveillance network was immediately available for the active surveillance of COVID-1948,49,50. Long-term surveillance is important to develop and improve the strategy of monitoring, preventing and controlling future influenza epidemics.

Accurate surveillance of AIV in wild waterfowl is critical in understanding viral diversity in the natural reservoir. Current surveillance methods for AIV involve collection of samples and transportation to a laboratory for molecular diagnostics. Processing of samples using this approach takes more than three days and may limit testing locations to those with practical access to laboratories. In potential outbreak situations, response times are critical, and delays have implications in terms of the spread of the virus that leads to increased economic cost. This study used nanopore sequencing technology for in-field sequencing and subtype characterisation of AIV strains collected from wild bird faeces and poultry. A custom in-field virus screening and sequencing protocol, including a targeted offline bioinformatic pipeline, was developed to accurately subtype AIV. Due to the lack of optimal diagnostic MinION packages for Australian AIV strains the bioinformatic pipeline was specifically targeted to confidently subtype local strains. The method presented eliminates the transportation of samples, dependence on internet access and delivers critical diagnostic information in a timely manner.

The disease manifests in the respiratory tract of avian species1 which, in severe cases can cause widescale death, particularly in poultry farms where birds are in confined spaces, allowing easy transmission of the virus2. Single incursions of the disease can therefore spread rapidly within and between poultry farms3, resulting in any detections of the virus leading to strict quarantine measures, mass depopulation and decontamination of the area in order to stop the spread4. Reports from the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH formally OIE) estimated in 2007 that the direct costs of an epornitic would be over 42 billion USD and total indirect costs at 1.5 trillion USD5. In more recent years, an agricultural outbreak of AIV in 2014–2015 in the United States of America caused an economic impact of approximately 874 million USD6 and more recently, a concurrent outbreak of three AIV strains in Victoria, Australia resulted in the culling of over 400,000 poultry birds in less than six months7. These two examples, plus modelling from the OIE, demonstrate the need for proactive detection in farmed poultry and monitoring of virus in wild waterfowl8,9.The disease is caused by infection with an avian derived, influenza virus (species Influenza A virus, family Orthomyxoviridae genus Alphainfluenzavirus,). The AIV genome consists of single-strand negative-sense RNA represented over eight distinct gene segments, contained within an enveloped virus particle2,10. The virus is categorised by two glycoproteins involved in virus cell entry and exit, encoded by the haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (N) gene segments. There are 18 (HA) and 9 (N) different subtypes2,11,12. Of the 18 HA subtypes, types H1-16 are present in wild bird populations; the virus’ natural reservoirs, with H17 and H18 exclusively found in bats11,12. Disease in farmed poultry and wild bird populations has been reported for many HA subtypes13.The H5 and H7 haemagglutinin subtypes in particular can cause significant disease in poultry14 and have been linked to major mortality events in chickens, and other farmed poultry15,16. On occasion, zoonotic transmission has also been reported in humans. These two subtypes of AIV cause serious damage in poultry due to the presence of a specific cleavage site in the HA segment17,18,19,20. In low pathogenicity avian influenza viruses (LPAIV), they contain a monobasic cleavage site. This site is recognised by trypsin-like proteases which are responsible for the cleavage of the HA protein precursor to support virus infectivity and restricting viral infection to the respiratory and intestinal tract19, so disease is often mild to moderate in farmed poultry13. In high pathogenicity avian influenza viruses (HPAIV), mutations in HA gene segments cause the HA protein precursor to contain a multibasic cleavage site that can be cleaved by ubiquitously expressed furin and other closely related proteases which facilitates systemic spread and entry into multiple cell types, causing higher mortality in poultry.Within wild bird populations, species within the orders Anseriformes (waterfowl) and Charadriiformes (shorebirds) are considered the main reservoirs9,14. Migratory birds within these orders travel through various flyways across the world, with the ability to spread AIV across geographically distinct regions. One example of this being the East Asia Australian Flyway, stretching from far north Russia to Australia21. Due to the distance, the birds undertake the journey in stages and therefore have contact with local avian wildlife and poultry, which can lead to transmission of viruses, introducing potential infection to naïve local birds22. AIV detections in Australia are generally considered to be genetically distinct from North American and European strains and therefore ongoing monitoring of viruses in local populations provides a baseline for any introductions of international novel influenza strains.Monitoring of AIVs in wild bird populations is conducted world-wide and is undertaken to understand genetic diversity and ecology of circulating strains, while ensuring diagnostics are fit for purpose to support commercial poultry industries as well as animal, and human health4. Protocols for AIV surveillance programs within wild bird populations currently have inherent delays due to sample transport to laboratories and the molecular testing processes used. Currently, pathotype classification (HPAIV and LPAIV) requires in vivo and Sanger genomic sequencing information, which is both slow and expensive. Revised in-field approaches and improved assays would enable faster diagnoses to be made, resulting in better disease containment for the poultry industries8,14,25. Whole genome sequencing provides the ability to accurately subtype and identify AIV strains, especially important for H7 and H5 strains where determination of the cleavage site will inform the pathogenicity. Current pathogenicity testing relies on 1st and 2nd generation sequencing (i.e., Sanger and Illumina, respectively), which take a minimum of 24 h to generate the necessary results to deliver the diagnosis; in outbreak settings this sequencing lag time could have compounding effects on the spread of the virus.The rise of 3rd generation sequencing (i.e., long-read) has enabled fast, on-location, real-time sequencing of whole viral genomes as a viable option for surveillance and outbreak tracing26,27,28,29,30. Pioneered by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), the MinION, a small hand-held portable sequencer, allows remote real-time sequencing of samples out of the laboratory. Direct sequencing eliminates the need to transport samples for testing, which reduces the time to a diagnosis and any potential for sample degradation. Rapid detection and response are of the upmost importance for containing viral outbreaks and supporting control measures, as illustrated in the Zika virus outbreaks in South America28. Many studies have progressed the application of molecular screening for viruses outside of standard laboratories in order to utilise the benefits that come with onsite diagnostics27,28,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37. These studies still face the associated challenges encountered with processing samples away from gold-standard laboratory-based facilities. Specifically, extracting nucleic acids and sequencing without cold chain, with minimal power requirements and subsequently undertaking comprehensive bioinformatics, has proved challenging. Although in-field pathogen detection of viruses has been shown to be possible, many of the challenges were not fully overcome and elements of mains connected electrical power or sophisticated cloud bioinformatics were required31,33,35. Several studies have also utilised reference mapping-based approach for consensus generation34,37, which is not suitable to all viruses, especially segmented viruses with high levels of variation such as AIV.This study aims to develop an end-to-end in-field protocol and bioinformatic pipeline to enable the diagnostician to go from sample to result (Fig. 1), including nucleic acid extraction, detection, sequencing and bioinformatic analysis of AIV samples collected from Anseriformes and domestic poultry with an emphasis on the classification of the HA segment in minimal time. The specific aim is not to develop a revised perfect diagnostic assay but to develop a HA subtyping surveillance tool that can confidently detect and subtype the HA gene in field. The process was developed to perform RNA extraction and PCR detection of AIV using instrumentation that can be powered from a vehicle, and to complete the sequencing and bioinformatic analysis with no internet access and only a laptop computer and a local preformatted database. Additionally, this study compares MinION derived and Illumina derived sequences to examine inherent error rates and validate and benchmark the accuracy of the newly developed assay against current standards and to assess the use of an influenza MinION positive sequencing control to monitor variation between MinION runs and assess variation in MinION derived sequence reads.Figure 1Flow chart of methods used in the study from sample collection to bioinformatic processes.Full size imageMaterials and methodsAIV positive and negative samplesSamples used in this study consisted of material collected from wild waterfowl and commercial chicken holdings in Victoria, Australia between 2010 and 2020. Three categories of samples were used in the study: historical AIV positive samples from wild waterfowl (n = 13), commercial poultry (n = 1) and wild bird field samples (n = 36) of unknow AIV status. AIV positive samples consisted of a collection of 13 AIV historical positive samples assembled from stored − 80 °C repositories at Agriculture Victoria and were used in the database. MinION sequencing was performed on a subset (n = 4) of the historical samples and consisted of subtypes H13, H16, H9 and H10. AIV historical samples, subtypes H9 and H10, consisted of cloacal swab samples collected from hunter shot ducks (Lake Bolac, Western District Region, Victoria) from 2019. AIV historical sample, subtypes H13 and H16, were environmental faecal swabs collected from the Werribee Water Treatment Plant (Werribee, Melbourne, Victoria, − 37.98941, 144.62386) in 2019. In addition, a further 36 fresh Anseriformes environmental wild bird faecal samples (of unknown AIV status) were also collected at the Werribee Water Treatment Plant as part of the National Avian Influenza in Wild Bird (NAIWB) surveillance program (wildlife permit 10008927, Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning, State Government of Victoria) for testing of the in-field deployable laboratory in June 2020. A single commercial chicken sample consisted of pooled faecal material collected from a commercial property during an outbreak of highly pathogenic (H7 subtype) AIV in Victoria in July 2020. All collected swabs were placed in 2 mL of viral transport media (VTM, comprised of brain–heart infusion (BHI) broth containing 2 × 106 U/L penicillin, 0.2 mg/mL streptomycin, 0.5 mg/mL gentamicin and 500 U/ml amphotericin B) transferred chilled at 4 °C to the laboratory, tested within a week of collection and stored at − 80 °C prior to subtype analysis and whole genome analysis.Australian AIV HA sequence databaseA customised HA gene reference database was developed for the in-field detection and characterisation of AIV in Australia (Table 1). Sequences were obtained from NCBI or GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org/) using the following search criteria: “Influenza database, full length, Australian with the selected HA subtype chosen” (Table 1). The 13 historical AIV samples were also sequenced as part of this study with the sequences deposited in NCBI (OL661617, OL661619, OL661620, OL661621, OL661622, OL661623, OL661624, OL661625, OL675252).Table 1 Viral strains and sequences used in the study divided into custom Australian specific database for HA segment identification and exotic sequences used in the phylogenetic analysis. All viruses are denoted with common nomenclature detailing influenza virus, sample host, location and year.Full size tableWhere no Australian AIV HA subtype sequences could be found using the above database text searches and were absent from the Agriculture Victoria historical collections, southern hemisphere full length sequences from countries of the East Asia Australia Flyway14, or neighbouring countries were used. HA segment sequences for the H8 and H14 subtypes were identified as absent and two sequences for each subtype were included in the database (Table 1).Illumina based genomic sequencingWhole genome Illumina based sequencing was performed on the 13 historical swab samples to enhance the AIV Australian database and for experimental MinION comparison (n = 4). RNA was extracted using QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), whole genome amplified38,39 and Illumina sequencing libraries prepared using PerkinElmer NEXTFLEX Rapid Directional RNA-Seq Kit 2.0 (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA). The finished libraries were quantified using a dsDNA HS assay on the Qubit (V3) (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and an HSD1000 assay on the Tapestation 2200 (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA), pooled in equimolar concentrations and diluted to 7 nM. The libraries were sequenced using an S4 NovaSeq flow cell or a MiSeq 600 cycle V3 kit. The sequences were assembled through IRMA40, an iterative assembler built for influenza construction, using the default FLU parameters.Synthetic AIV positive control for RT-PCR and MinION sequencingA positive control was included to monitor the inter-assay performance of AIV whole genome amplification, the MinION DNA library preparation and subsequent sequencing. The positive control consisted of a synthetic double stranded DNA (dsDNA) fragment (Gene block, Integrated DNA Technologies, Iowa, USA) encoding the H17 HA gene segment (Genbank accession number CY103892.1 bp 1–1784), flanked at either end by the influenza universal whole genome amplification primer sequences (MB-Tuni12 and 13 primers)41. This enabled amplification of the synthetic positive control along with the AIV samples. A mass of 40 pg of the dsDNA gene fragment was amplified with 45 µL Platinum PCR High Fidelity SuperMix (1U enzyme) (ThermoFisher, MA, USA), and 1 µL of 10 µM solution of each MB-Tuni12 and MB-Tuni1341 primers in a total volume of 50 µL. The mix was amplified with the following conditions: 94 °C for 30 s then 30 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s and 68 °C for 2 min. The amplified product was purified using an Isolate II PCR and Gel Kit (Bioline, London, UK), diluted to 1/1000 and quantified using the Qubit (V3) HS dsDNA kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA). The cleaned, amplified dsDNA positive control was diluted to form three solutions of varying copy number: (1000, 10,000 and 100,000) based on calculations using the molecular weight and Avogadro’s number42. The 1000 copy number solution was then used as a positive control in all batches of samples to monitor reproducibility of the PCR and MinION sequencing procedures.In-field RNA extraction method and laboratory comparisonRNA from all samples in this study were extracted using the in-field Biomeme M1 Bulk Sample Prep Kit (Biomeme Inc., Philadelphia, USA). Optimisation for AIV detection required major modifications to the standard protocol. Briefly, 140 µL of the samples in VTM was mixed with 280 µL of Biomeme lysis buffer by carefully drawing the liquid mixture up and down approximately 30 times in the provided syringe with a silica membrane. The liquid was incubated in the syringe for two minutes and expelled (removing all liquid). The syringe was washed with one pump of 500 µL of the Biomeme Protein Wash followed by 750 µL of either the Biomeme Wash Buffer, or the Invitrogen PureLink Viral RNA/DNA wash buffer II (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA), which was found to be equivalent (data not shown). A 1000 µL aliquot of the Biomeme Drying Wash solution was drawn up and expelled and the syringe air dried by repeated drawing up and expulsion of air for approximately 30 pumps until no droplets were expelled. The syringe was left to air dry for one minute before 150 µL of the Biomeme Elution Buffer was drawn up into the syringe and left to incubate for two minutes at ambient temperature. The liquid was expelled and drawn up for seven pumps before final expulsion of the eluate into a clean 1.5 mL tube. The resulting 150 µL nucleic acid extract was used for testing and sequencing.RNA was also extracted using the Invitrogen PureLink Viral RNA/DNA (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Comparative analysis between the Biomeme M1 and Invitrogen PureLink Viral RNA/DNA spin extraction kit used serial dilutions of AIV-infected cell lines which were spiked into negative field collected, environmental faecal material and the relative viral load was determined by RT-qPCR.In-field AIV screening of nucleic acid extracts using RT-qPCRNucleic acid extracts were tested for AIV by RT-qPCR which amplifies the matrix segment of the virus. Briefly, samples were processed following the AIV Type A generic assay38 with 1 µL of the primer/probe mix (containing 0.9 µM of both forward and reverse primers and 0.25 µM of probe from Heine et al.38), 5 µL of extracted RNA, 12.5 µL of X2 AgPath-ID One Step PCR RT buffer, 1 µL of X25 AgPath-ID RT PCR enzyme (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA) and molecular grade water to make up a 25 µL volume. The samples were then run with the following conditions: 45 °C for 60 min; 95 °C for 10 min; and 45 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 45 s. For the in-field deployable laboratory, the RT-qPCR assay was conducted on a Mic PCR machine (BioMolecular Systems, New South Wales, Australia) supported by a 12-V battery (Itech 120AH LifePo4) linked to an Itech 2000-W Sinewave inverter and powered by a 100 series 4 × 4 Toyota Landcruiser. AIV positive samples were taken forward for sequencing.In-field protocol for whole genome amplification of AIVWhole genome amplification of the AIV positive samples was performed as described38,39 with only 20 cycles of routine amplification. Briefly, samples were mixed with 12.5 µL Superscript III One-Step PCR reaction buffer, 0.5 µL of SuperScript III RT/Platinum Taq Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA), 0.5 µL of each individual primer (MB-Tuni12 and 1341), 2.5 µL of RNA template and water to make up 25 µL volume. The samples were then run with the following conditions: 42 °C for 60 min, 94 °C for 2 min, 5 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 45 °C for 45 s, 68 °C for 3 min, and 20 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 57 °C for 45 s, 68 °C for 3 min and a final extension of 68 °C for 5 min.In-field protocol for library preparationLibraries for sequencing were prepared from the whole genome amplified positive samples (7.5 µL per sample) using the ONT Rapid Barcoding Kit (SQK-RBK004, protocol version RBK_9054_v2_revN_14Aug2019) with modifications. No magnetic bead clean-up was used after barcode pooling and 1.3 µL of RAP was used in the 13 µL library. 1.2 µL of nuclease free water was added in the final library preparation step instead of the recommended 4.5 µL as the pooled barcoded samples was 14.3µL Approximately 500 copies in 5.5 µl of the H17 amplified gene segment made up the dsDNA positive control. The negative control was a sample from a previous surveillance trip that tested negative that was carried through the same process as the positive samples. Each sample had unique DNA barcodes ligated and were then pooled to form a single sequencing library. The volume of each sample pooled for library preparation was adjusted according to the Ct detected using the AIV RT- qPCR, with post-amplification values ranging from 6.5 to 16.6. Nucleic acid extracts with a Ct of 20 and above had 2.5 µL of the whole genome amplified material added to the final pooled library. A sample with a Ct value in the range of 10–15 had 1.5 µL added to the library and a sample with a Ct value of less than 10 had 1.0 µL added. Bead cleaning was not performed and the ratio of rapid sequencing adaptors (RAP) to pooled barcoded DNA was maintained (1.3 µL for 13 µL of pooled DNA). The final pooled DNA library was diluted to a total volume of 15.5 µL.Development of a deployable, in-field avian influenza virus detection and characterisation systemThe portable system consisted of three main components- (1) wet lab reagents and consumables (Supplementary data 1), (2) the Mic PCR machine for AIV screening of samples and whole genome amplification of positive samples, (3) and the portable sequencer (MinION Mk1B device) and associated high-powered laptop. A minimal number of boxes and equipment were used to transport equipment needed to set up a small diagnostic-like laboratory. Everything required for the analysis in-field was packed up and transported in a single box (Fig. 2a–c). The Dell Precision laptop was transported in a pelican case which had specific foam indents for the MinION Mk1b to be stored in. A small camping table was also bought alongside.Figure 2Deployed and functional portable laboratory set up. (a) Mid-RNA extraction in-field using the Biomeme M1 RNA extraction kit. (b) The MIC PCR machine performing that TaqMan assay out the back of the Landcruiser. (c) The entire kit packed up (all equiptment listed in Supplamentary data 1).Full size imageMinION sequencing and real-time, offline basecallingThe pooled barcoded MinION library was loaded onto the MinION Mk1b (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford, United Kingdom) sequencer with an R9.4 flow cell. The sequencer was powered by a custom Dell Precision 7740 laptop (64 GB SD RAM, 4 TB SSD, Intel® Xeon 8 Core Processor, Ubuntu 18.04, NVIDIA Quadro RTX 5000 GPU). The library was basecalled in real-time using MinKNOW version 3.0.4 with offline basecalling (Guppy version 3.2.10) enabled so to be independent of any internet connection requirements (provided by Oxford Nanopore upon request). Basecalled reads were converted from fastq to fasta file format using seqtk (version 1.3) (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk) for subsequent analysis.AIV HA subtype characterisationFasta files from the test samples were BLASTn analysed (version 2.6.0) with the following parameters specified; outfmt 6 -max_target_seqs 1 -max_hsps 1 -evalue 0.00001, against the customised Australian AIV database as part of this study (Table 1) to identify HA subtype which in turn was used for consensus sequence generation.Three distinct bioinformatic workflows were developed and evaluated to determine the best in-field bioinformatic process for AIV HA subtype characterisation. The following parameters were selected and measured as bioinformatic performance metrics: time and computational power required to complete the analysis; nucleotide similarity (when compared to Illumina generated genomic sequences of the same sample); and HA gene segment coverage. BLASTn 2 Sequences (version 2.6.0) program was used to compare the consensus sequence output for all three methods. Reads that mapped to the Australian AIV database (Table 1) are referred to as the mapping reads and were then processed through the following methods.Method 1- CAP3 de novo assemblyThe CAP3 tool for assembly and contig construction was evaluated, which uses nucleotide overlaps in reads to construct contigs43. Generated contigs were then assembled into an HA segment consensus sequence. Subsequently, the top two contigs, or the singular assembled consensus sequence (whichever was longer), were analysed using BLASTn. A BLASTn 2 sequence analysis was manually run locally with the generated consensus sequence and sequence which it mapped to from the database. The identity and coverage of the contigs were recorded. The CAP3 de novo assembly pipeline did not interfere with the ongoing sequencing and could be initiated at any time but would only uses the data generated up to that point in time.Method 2- Geneious de novo assemblyMinION reads mapping to the Australian avian influenza HA sequence database were imported into Geneious (Version 2020.1.1) and processed using the de novo assembler with high sensitivity/medium selected as an option. “Trim sequences” and “save contigs” (max 1000) were both selected. The contig with the most mapped reads was used to generate the consensus sequence by selecting the “generate consensus” option with a 25% strictness setting.Method 3- Geneious reference mappingA second method using Geneious (Version 2020.1.1) was used to produce a HA consensus. MinION reads mapping to the Australian avian influenza HA sequence database were imported into Geneious. The viral Influenza Database subtype with the most corresponding hits was used as the reference and the MinION reads were mapped to the representative subtype sequence. The resulting mapped consensus was used in subsequent analysis.Phylogenetic analysisThe custom-made database and method outputs from this study were made into a phylogenetic tree which included avian associated HA subtypes (H1-H16) the existing Australian database, which was enhanced with exotic strains, resulting in 55 sequences in total (Table 1A and B). The sequence data was processed using MEGA11, Maximum Likelihood tree builder, 1000 bootstrapping, nucleotide substitution, Jukes-Cantor Model with partial deletion and the average site cut-off at 51%.ResultsGeneration of custom database for AIV diagnosticsA collection of 13 historical AIV positive swab samples were identified, whole genome sequenced on an Illumina platform and assembled using IRMA to act as gold standard references. All assembled viral whole genome sequences were HA segment confirmed through online BLAST analysis. These sequences along with other NCBI or GISAID sequences formed the Australian AIV database (Table 1A), resulting in a total of 40 sequences.In-field RNA extraction method for AIV detection and sequencingAn optimised in-field RNA extraction protocol was developed to support the detection and sequencing of AIV from avian cloacal swabs and environmental faecal samples. To assess the recovery of nucleic acid the in-field RNA extraction method (Biomeme M1 Bulk RNA) was compared with the laboratory based nucleic extraction kit (Invitrogen PureLink RNA/DNA extraction kit). The optimised in-field syringe-based extraction method yielded viral RNA levels comparable to the laboratory based nucleic acid extraction kit as determined by AIV specific qRT-PCR (Fig. 3). For AIV dilutions of 1/10 to 1/10 000 the in-field extraction method obtained Ct values of 30.21 (se 0.55) to 40.97 (se 3.51) respectively, compared to 28.97(se 0.57) to 42.35 (se 4.6) for the laboratory based nucleic extraction kit respectively (Fig. 3).Figure 3A comparison of in-field Biomeme M1 Bulk RNA Kit (blue) and laboratory based nucleic acid extraction kit (Invitrogen PureLink RNA/DNA extraction kit) (orange) for the recovery of AIV RNA in environmental faecal samples. Mean Cq values from three replicates tested in the AIV RT-PCR assay is shown (total number of samples = 30, three samples per dilution per kit). Error bars represent the standard deviation of experimentation run in triplicate.Full size imageHA subtype classificationThe positive synthetic H17 control included in all batches processed, gave a consistent indication of the quality of MinION runs and therefore whether the subsequent sequence data from field samples could be used. The cut off for a successful run was deemed to be > 100 mapping reads from the synthetic control to the database (data not shown).A subset of four (H9, H10, H13, H16) samples from the historical AIV positives repository, a commercial poultry sample (H7) as well as the ds DNA H17 positive and the negative control were processed through the in-field MinION HA characterisation tool (Table 2). Generated reads were characterised using a BLASTn comparison to the HA Australian Database generated in this study (Table 1). The majority of samples generated database hits that were identified as a singular predominant HA subtype (H9 = 5202 (99.8%), H10 = 9787 (99.9%), H16 = 227 (86.3%), H17 = 249 (90.5%), H13 = 1533 (98.9%), H7 = 22,503 (100%)). The AIV sample (H16 subtype) that was detected and sequenced had the lowest number of correctly attributed reads with the majority of the reads (34) that were misattributed were designated as H13 (21, (7.9%)). The negative control generated 535,589 reads, with a single read mapping to the AIV Australian database (H9).Table 2 MinION generated reads mapping to the Australia AIV HA database** to enable real-time subtype level classification of reads.Full size tableHA subtype genomic characterisationFollowing the HA sequence identification, the filtered reads were sub-selected into a new fasta file and assembled through the three methods presented. The pipelines differed in both the computational requirements and time to results (Table 3). A comparison of the percentage sequence identity and percentage coverage of the HA segment of six selected AIV isolates generated by the in-field MinION sequencing method was made with the corresponding Illumina sequences (Fig. 4; Table 3). All of the samples generated consensus sequences that on average had over 75% coverage for the HA gene and were > 90% identical to their relevant Illumina reference sequence (Table 3).Table 3 Comparison of the three different MinION assembly methods (Method 1 CAP3 de novo assembly, Method 2 Genious de novo method and Method 3 Geneious reference mapping) used to assemble MinION generated, BLASTn mapped reads of the AIV HA segment.Full size tableFigure 4Consensus sequence comparison of three different analyses methods (Method 1- CAP3 de novo assembly. Method 2- Geneious de novo assembly, Method 3- Geneious reference mapping) against Illumina derived reference sequence, measured using BLASTn 2 Sequences program. The Illumina generated IRMA assembled consensus was compared to each of the MinION based consensuses to assess on accuracy.Full size imageAcross the different subtypes, CAP3 de novo assembly Method 1 generated results within 10 min for a single barcode (single sample), could run multiple barcodes in parallel and showed the highest coverage (mean 87.6%; range 78–93%) across the HA segment, with a high percentage identity (mean 94.09%; range 90.48–99.11%). Geneious de novo assembly Method 2 and reference mapping Method 3 required a longer processing time (up to 4 h), and as neither method could process multiple barcodes at the same time, would take an estimated 4–6 h to process eight barcodes. Method 2 had the lowest coverage (mean 75.2%; range 56–87%) with a percentage identity comparable to Method 1 (mean 95.95%; range 87.61–99.13%), but also had the largest variance of both mean percentage identity and percentage coverage. Method 3 generated the highest percentage identity (mean 99.39%; range 97.87–99.82%), which was consistent across the subtypes as demonstrated by the low standard deviation (0.77) across more than two thirds of the HA segment (mean 77.8%; range 69–86%) (Table 3).Phylogenetic analysis of in-field MinION derived consensus sequenceA comparison of the consensus sequences generated using the three bioinformatic methods was undertaken through phylogenetic analysis that included the sequences from the Australian avian influenza sequence database, in addition to exotic genomic sequences (Fig. 5). The HA subtypes created their own clades with some subtypes creating closer genetic relationships (H13/H16, H15/H7 and H14/H4), suggesting higher degrees of evolutionary relatedness than with other subtypes. The consensus sequences generated using the three bioinformatic methods described in this study, placed the derived genomic sequences within their respective HA subtype branches. Phylogenetic analysis identified the consensus sequences derived using Method 3, most accurately matched the related Illumina derived sequences, (Fig. 5).Figure 5An unrooted maximum likelihood (ML) of 55 avian influenza A virus haemagglutinin sequences (Table1A and B, excluding H17) worldwide obtained from MEGA11.

Pairwise patristic distance of sequences can be found in Supplementary Data (2).Full size imageIn-field protocol deploymentThe in-field deployable sequencing capability (Fig. 2a–c) was successfully tested in Werribee, Victoria. RNA was extracted from 36 field samples and screened for the presence of AIV using whole genome amplification38,39. No positive samples were identified from the 36 samples screened as confirmed by the laboratory-based AIV qRT- PCR (data not shown).DiscussionEarly detection of viruses is critical for managing potentially detrimental impacts of a disease outbreak, as a fast and effective response increases the chances of pathogen containment and eradication44. In this study, we describe a field deployable laboratory that can, through a series of functional wet lab and bioinformatic processes, detect AIV in field collected samples as well as characterise and phylogenetically analyse the AIV HA gene sequence, all within hours of sample collection. Although the proposed methods presented here are most likely not at the sensitivity level of standard matrix gene qPCR assays, it is a fast, confirmatory test which allows faster and more specific actions if required.The rapid development of genomic technologies in the past decade has enabled the possibility of novel, point-of-care genomic diagnostics to become a reality45. The in-field sequencing capability described in this paper has been achieved using a range of recently available technologies and reagents including syringe-based RNA extractions, a rapid library preparation kit for in-field ONT sequencing and bioinformatic analysis of datasets. Use of syringe-based extractions has been effective in previous viral studies46 and was effective in this study for the detection and amplification of AIV RNA in a strictly in-field setting with extraction results comparable to those generated by laboratory-based RNA extraction protocols (Fig. 3).Although AIV has been sequenced using the MinION34,37,47,48,49, a field-deployable sequencing method for HA subtype classification, has not been reported. The ONT sequencing protocols using the Rapid Barcoding Kit (SQK-RBK004) have been successful but required lab-based spin column extraction methods, quantification of nucleic acid concentrations with Qubit and magnetic bead clean-up of the pooled sequence libraries that requires extra utilities which increases the equipment footprint of the methods. The protocol for pooling Rapid Kit barcodes recommends that the clean-up of libraries using magnetic beads is required to remove excess adapters and nucleic acids. However, magnetic beads require extra equipment and a sterile environment, which are both impractical for field work and pooling barcodes runs the risk of overloading the MinION flowcell with excess nucleic acid. In order to circumvent these requirements, the Rapid protocol was modified to vary the volume of sample added depending on the Ct value of the AIV samples derived from the qRT-PCR38,39 (and therefore the concentration of nucleic acid). This method removes the need for quantification on instruments (i.e., Qubit) but also allows the user to have control over the amount of nucleic acid used.The ONT Rapid Kit uses transposon-based fragmentation of DNA resulting in short and variable read lengths of moderate quality as the output. These inherent differences mean that the ONT reads generated from the ONT Rapid Kit are not suitable for short read specific de novo assembly programs that are designed specifically for pair end reads generated from Illumina sequencers. Reads generated in this study (ranging from between 160 and 1800 bp) were also too short for conventional MinION de novo assemblers such as wtdbg250, Canu51 and Flye52. Although the reads were of similar sizes to second-generation high-throughput sequence data, MinION reads do not contain Phred scores and are not paired reads, two points of data which are used in the analysis of second-generation high-throughput sequence data. Consequently, reference-based approaches have been typically used to generate viral consensus sequences from the Rapid Kit27,28,29,30,34,37,53. More sophisticated methods of HA subtype classification have been developed, for example IRMA, an iteratively trained assembler developed by the Centre for Disease Control (USA). IRMA is a well-accepted and efficient method of genomic characterisation of virus genomes from short read and high quality ONT data that has been widely used37,48. However, the AIV database developed for IRMA is built and trained on sequence data of American viruses and strains and given the high variability between HA subtypes and clades this is not currently an appropriate approach for ONT Rapid Kit derived sequence data in Australia.To overcome these issues and to classify HA subtypes from MinION sequencing reads, a “BLASTn-to-database method” was used in this study. Although similar approaches have been used before34,47 the bioinformatic approaches did not have the initial BLAST based analysis step and employed the Method 3 (Geneious) approach tested here, which is impractical for in field deployment given the computational and time (~ 4 h) investment. Reference mapping approaches also require prior knowledge of the samples, an issue when using unknown field samples. McCuen et al.49 utilised a BLAST step to identify unknown field samples before lab-based processing using the Influenza Research Database curated by the U.S National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases containing over 10,000 sequences, mostly originating from the Northern Hemisphere. The Influenza Research Database contained only 92 Australian sequences, covering just 11 HA subtypes (missing H16, H13, H14, H8, H2, H17) and only 18 of these sequences were generated post-2000 (19.5% of sequences). The data set assembled and used in this study (Table 1) contains 26 unique sequences post-2000 (69% of sequences in the database, the H5 is identical in both databases) that covered 13 subtypes as well as four subtypes that haven’t been detected in Australia (H2, H8, H14, H17).The BLASTn-to-database screening method used to identify AIV sequence reads and assign putative HA subtype is effective as there is significant sequence divergence between subtypes of AIV (Fig. 5). Some subtypes are more closely related than others and therefore with minimal MinION data it is possible that misattributions can occur in the BLASTn screening step as seen in this study with 7.9% of reads generated from the H16 sample attributed to the close relative H13 (Table 2). Methods 1, 2 and 3 presented here successfully classified the HA subtypes within their respective clades (Fig. 5). Method 1 CAP3 de novo assembly was preferred over Method 2 and 3 due to the speed (30 min vs. 6 h vs. 4 h respectively). The success of this method highlights the need for further processing of the BLASTn analysis as it removes any reads that have been potentially misattributed.The secondary analysis step involving Methods 1, 2 and 3 presented here (Fig. 1) successfully classified the HA subtypes within their respective clades (Fig. 5). Although Method 1 CAP3 generated the lowest mean percentage identity comparison between the MinION and Illumina sequences of 94% (Table 3) this percentage sequence identity was much higher than the 70% sequence divergence observed between AIV subtypes54. It is therefore unlikely that misattribution of HA subtypes will occur using this method. By adding the basic secondary analysis consensus step of Method 1 CAP3 to the pipeline presented here, any lack of confidence from the BLASTn analysis can be easily removed. When combined with phylogenetic alignment to local and international strains, the fast and accurate classification of the AIV subtypes is readily achievable. The ability to perform this classification in-field and in a timely fashion highlights the utility of the methods presented here. The aim of this study was not to reach perfect identity and coverage of the HA segment, but to confidently detect and subtype AIV in-field in the most rapid manner as this information informs incursion response decisions.Despite the advances reported here for the in-field detection, sequencing and subtyping of AIV strains, there are further improvements that would facilitate faster sample processing of field samples. Advances in datasets and software applications could enable specific AIV sequence assemblers to be developed and trained on country or region-specific genome sequence data, for the specific identification of the HA subtype. The use of neural networks in genomics is also allowing a greater processing of data in a comprehensive and timely manner55. With suitable training, a neural network would overcome the inherent variability from the HA gene. A subsequent analysis would determine the origin of all AIV genome segments, including the HA gene, thus giving comprehensive data from the detected AIV in regional field settings, allowing determination of the origin of the virus and any biosecurity implications.The in-field syringe-based extraction, although comparable to laboratory-based methods, was time consuming and unable to process multiple samples simultaneously. With the rising interest in viral genomic epidemiology, high throughput extraction methods are needed, and some advances are being made in this area. For example, QuickExtract56,57,58 has been successfully used in the extraction of SARS-CoV-2 for bulk RT-PCR screening but it has yet to be tested in a field capacity.Enrichment of the target nucleic acid to be sequenced could be improved to enhance the ease and efficiency of sequencing targeted organisms and loci. In this study PCR was used to amplify the AIV genome prior to sequencing. However, the time required to amplify using PCR in-field took hours not minutes, which is a significant advance but still not optimal. Improved polymerase enzymes would remove these limitations and methods using the loop-mediated amplification59 (LAMP) Bst enzyme should be investigated. LAMP as an enrichment method could be deployed more widely as it has been proven to be effective in-field on viruses such as Dengue60, Chikungunya61,62 and Zika63. An alternative to enzymatic enrichment is via a more targeted sequencing approach. Adaptive sequencing approaches being developed by ONT enable the user to dictate which nucleic acid sequences are processed through the ONT sequencing platform64,65. By using raw reads, Payne et al.65 demonstrate the utility of sequencing selected reads on large human datasets and enriching for specific chromosome sequences. Similarly, Martin et al.64 have used adaptive sequencing effectively on mock bacterial communities which showed enrichment up to a fourfold increase. This method has the potential to enable enrichment of the desired sequence without the issues associated with enzymatic amplification, increasing the specificity of the sequencing platform.Bioinformatics is an ongoing issue with in-field sequencing but hopefully as MinION in-field work increases and the importance of fast diagnostics becomes increasingly prevalent, more work will be dedicated to filling in the caveats of field research identified here and in other studies. Having a standard MinION based protocol for all viruses would be valuable, however the bioinformatics needs to be carefully crafted to the question at hand. Protocols such as the ARTIC networks’ RAMPART prove to be useful in constructing and identifying SARS-CoV-2 genomes in a real-time manner but when applied to viruses such as AIV they are not nearly as applicable as the number of reference genomes needed are much greater than those for the coronaviruses or Ebola to accurately encompass the diversity present. As sequencing becomes increasingly essential and routine in a broader number of scenarios, the data sets developed will enable a more data rich future leading to the need for ever faster diagnostics and methods, that the study has tried, in part, to address.ConclusionsThis study developed an in-field detection and sequencing methodology for AIV and overcame all of the challenges faced to deliver outcomes that have the same level of similarity and accuracy as compared to the gold-standard Illumina IRMA constructed genome. The in-field detection and sequencing methodology applied in this study to historical AIV positive samples shows a high level of similarity and accuracy when compared to the gold-standard Illumina IRMA constructed genomes. However there remains significant challenges regarding in-field AIV detection and sequence analysis in both procedural and bioinformatic processes to deliver fast real-time, in-field sequence characterisation of AIV.

Previous methods of measuring hemagglutinin (HA) content required the standard antibody, thus rapid preparation of H3N2 microneedle vaccines targeting the mutant H3N2 was delayed as a result of lacking a standard antibody. In this study, H3N2 microneedle vaccines were prepared by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) without the use of an antibody, and the cross-protection of the vaccines against several antigenic variants was observed. The HA content measured by HPLC was compared with that measured by ELISA to observe the accuracy of the HPLC analysis of HA content. The cross-protection afforded by the H3N2 microneedle vaccines was evaluated against several antigenic variants in mice. Microneedle vaccines for the 2019–20 seasonal H3N2 influenza virus (19–20 A/KS/17) were prepared using a dip-coating process. The cross-protection of 19–20 A/KS/17 H3N2 microneedle vaccines against the 2015–16 seasonal H3N2 influenza virus in mice was investigated by monitoring body weight changes and survival rate. The neutralizing antibody against several H3N2 antigenic variants was evaluated using the plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). HA content in the solid microneedle vaccine formulation with trehalose post-exposure at 40℃ for 24 h was 48% and 43% from the initial HA content by HPLC and ELISA, respectively. The vaccine was administered to two groups of mice, one by microneedles and the other by intramuscular injection (IM). In vivo efficacies in the two groups were found to be similar, and cross-protection efficacy was also similar in both groups. HPLC exhibited good diagnostic performance with H3N2 microneedle vaccines and good agreement with ELISA. The H3N2 microneedle vaccines elicited a cross-protective immune response against the H3N2 antigenic variants. Here, we propose the use of HPLC for a more rapid approach in preparing H3N2 microneedle vaccines targeting H3N2 virus variants.

Due to the presence of immune cells within the dermal layer, vaccine delivery using microneedles has been actively studied3,4,5,6,7,8. In particular, influenza microneedle (MN) vaccines are being preclinically and clinically studied and have been found to produce immunological efficacy similar to that provided by intramuscular (IM) administration9,10,11,12,13.Seasonal influenza viruses cause an epidemic in local regions which then spreads globally and therefore recognition of seasonal viruses at an early stage is important in determining the virus that will be prevalent in a year14. However, the efficacy of a seasonal influenza vaccine is greatly reduced due to antigenic variation as well as when vaccine strain does not match with circulating strain15,16,17. In particular, seasonal H3N2 influenza vaccines show a low level of effectiveness due to antigenic variation18. Thus, cross-protection provided by the H3N2 vaccine is essential due to the mutating frequency of the H3N2 virus19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26.Two proteins; hemagglutinin and neuraminidase are present on the surface of influenza A virus (IAV) and the quantification of the influenza vaccine antigen is determined by measuring the concentration of the HA protein. Currently, single radial immunodiffusion (SRID) assay or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) are commonly used to measure the concentration of the influenza vaccine antigen. However, these methods require standard antigens and antibodies provided by the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC) along with a 2–3 month preparation period, which may be a limiting factor in the manufacturing of vaccines. It was reported that the HA content measured by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for H1N1- and H3N2-subtype viruses was comparable to that of SRID and ELISA assays27,28,29.In order to prepare a microneedle vaccine to target a virus that mutates frequently like H3N2, a measurement for the amount of active antigen is required in order to load an accurate predetermined amount of vaccine into the microneedle. However, if several months are needed for antibody preparation, the preparation of microneedle vaccines as well as related stability studies become increasingly difficult. Therefore, measurement of antigen activity without the standard antibody facilitates the preparation process of microneedle vaccines. In this study, as shown in Fig. 1a, H3N2 microneedle vaccines were prepared using HPLC measurement of HA content, and because the H3N2 virus is highly mutable, cross-protection of H3N2 microneedle vaccines was observed. Measurement of HA content is important for the preparation of H3N2 microneedle vaccines as it can be used to detect a possible denaturation of the H3N2 vaccine. The HA content of H3N2 and the stability of the formulation were measured using HPLC because HPLC analysis does not require the H3N2 antibody (Fig. 1b). H3N2 microneedle vaccines were prepared with the 2019–20 seasonal A/Kansas/14/2017 influenza H3N2 vaccine (19–20 A/KS/17). Cross-protection against 2010–12 seasonal A/Perth/16/2009 influenza H3N2 virus (10–12 A/PE/09), 2014–15 seasonal A/Texas/30/2012 influenza H3N2 virus (14–15 A/TX/12), and 2015–16 seasonal A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 influenza H3N2 virus (15–16 A/SW/13) was also evaluated (Fig. 1c). The cross-protective response of the microneedle vaccination was compared with that of conventional IM vaccination.Figure 1Schematic diagram of H3N2 microneedle vaccine development based on HPLC analysis of HA for cross-protection of influenza H3N2 virus. (a) Preparation of 19–20 A/KS/17 H3N2 microneedle vaccine, (b) pretreatment of HA, (c) establishment of HPLC-based analysis of HA content of H3N2 vaccine stability and comparison with ELISA, and (d) observation of cross-reactivity immune response against 10–12 A/PE/09, 14–15 A/TX/12, and 15–16 A/SW/13 H3N2 viruses in animal experiments.Full size imageResults and discussionGeometries of H3N2 microneedle vaccineThe uncoated H3N2 microneedle vaccines were made of PLA, an FDA-approved polymer. When the antigen content of the MN-Tre20 and MN-Tre100 groups was analyzed by Bradford protein assay, the loading amounts of HBsAg were 3.1 ± 0.3 and 3.1 ± 0.2 μg/array, respectively. The manufacturing process of H3N2 influenza microneedles requires repeated measurements of many samples during the optimization and manufacturing processes. For the large number of samples, protein concentration measurement provided fast quantitative analysis. The solid H3N2 vaccine formulation contains stabilizers and excipients in addition to the vaccine. Most of the solid formulation consists of these additives, and the vaccine is uniformly distributed within the formulation. In this study, the protein content of the solid formulation was 1.4% and 0.66% for Tre-20 and Tre-100, respectively. Therefore, if the amount of coated formulation is uniform, the vaccine content is uniform. In this study, the standard deviation in vaccine amount between microneedles was 10% or less. Also, as shown in the optical image in Fig. 2a and the fluorescence microscope image in Fig. 2b of microneedles coated with the FITC-dextran formulation, there was a uniform coating layer over all tips of the microneedles in the array. SEM images in Figs. 2c,d, show that the coating layer covered approximately one third of the microneedles from the tip, to allow for delivery into the skin even if the microneedles were only partially inserted. The distribution of the coating layer near the end of the tips is helpful for proper delivery of the vaccine.Figure 2Images of coated microneedles. (a) Optical microscopic image (scale bar = 500 μm) and (b) fluorescence image of FITC-dextran coating layer on microneedles (scale bar = 500 μm). (c) Enlarged SEM image of H3N2 microneedle vaccine. (d) SEM image of H3N2 microneedle vaccine array (scale bar = 500 μm).Full size imagePuncture performance of coated microneedlesAll microneedles were successful in penetrating the skin, and the coating layer was delivered into the skin (Fig. 3a). Observing the cross-section of the trypan blue dots showed that the insertion depth of the coating layer into the skin was 600 μm and the trypan blue layer was distributed through the epidermis and dermis, as shown in Fig. 3b. Thus, PLA microneedles had sufficient mechanical strength to penetrate the stratum corneum and successfully delivered the coating layer into the skin. The microneedle system used in this study involves coated microneedles. Compared to other types of microneedles, our microneedle type is suitable for vaccine delivery because the manufacturing temperature can be controlled11 and the mechanical strength for successful insertion is provided by the microneedle shafts of coated microneedles30. Thus, mechanical strength should not be considered for the design of the formulation and various kinds of materials can be used as additives for improving the stability of the vaccine and increasing immune efficacy.Figure 3(a) Optical image of the porcine skin surface after administration and removal of trypan blue microneedles (Scale bar = 1 mm). (b) Optical image of a cross-section of the microneedles passing through the blue dots (Scale bar = 500 μm). ‘SC’, ‘EP’, and ‘DE’ refer to stratum corneum, epidermis, and dermis, which are components of the skin layer, respectively. Trypan blue containing the vaccine was transferred to the epidermis and dermis of the skin.Full size imageEx vivo delivery efficiency of coating layerThe amount of residual FITC-dextran on the surface of the microneedles after administration to porcine skin for 30 min and removal was 18% of the total amount applied to the microneedles. The amount of FITC-dextran remaining in the cotton swab was around 11% of the total amount after the porcine skin surface was swabbed. The FITC-dextran was left on the porcine skin surface due to backflow of body fluid during attachment of the microneedles. As a result, the amount delivered into the skin was roughly 71% of the total amount coated on the microneedles. When 18% of the total formulation was left on the surface of microneedles, the amount of left protein on the surface is 1.4% of left formulation, and 30% of left protein is HA.Diffusion profile of fluorescence in skinA distribution of fluorescence intensity higher than the user-defined threshold intensity was observed from 15 to 330 min after initial administration (Fig. 4a). FITC-dextran was used as a model drug with a molecular weight (MW) of 70 kDa because the molecular weight of the antigen of H3N2 split vaccine is close to 70 kDa. In addition, changes in intensity on the surface of the microneedles were quantitatively expressed over time (Fig. 4b). The fluorescence intensity decreased most sharply between 30 and 60 min after initial administration. Most of the fluorescence signal was undetectable after 210 min. The diffusion rate of the FITC-dextran was affected by the phase of dissolution of the coating layer from a solid layer into a gel and then a liquid solution. The FITC-dextran slowly diffused in the skin over several hours as the dissolution of the coating layer progressed.Figure 4(a) Fluorescence image on the microneedle surface observed with a confocal microscope at 15, 30, 60, 90, 150, 210, 270, and 330 min (scale bar = 200 μm). (b) Change in fluorescence intensity on the surface of microneedle tips from 15 to 330 min.Full size imageEvaluation of hemagglutinin content and thermal stability measurement using HPLC and ELISAThe measured HA content of the liquid vaccine was 28% and 22% at 25 °C and 12% and 8% at 40 °C by HPLC and ELISA, respectively. Values of 31%, 41%, and 43% of HA content were obtained by ELISA after additional exposure of H3N2 Film, Film-Tre20, and Film-Tre100 at 40 °C for 24 h, respectively. HA contents of 23%, 49%, and 48% were detected by HPLC measurement for H3N2 Film, Film-Tre20, and Film-Tre100 after exposure at 40 °C for 24 h. Comparisons are summarized in Table 1. HPLC results were similar to those of ELISA results because ELISA and HPLC used the same pretreatment to obtain active HA. The ELISA assay and SRID are conventional methods for determining the HA content of vaccines. However, it takes 2–3 months to prepare standard antibodies, and antibody preparation is a key factor that delays vaccine development during a pandemic. In addition, antibody preparation causes delay in the development of microneedle vaccines that require precise HA measurement to determine proper formulation and stability. The preparation of H3N2 microneedle vaccines using HPLC-based assays enables rapid preparation and accurate loading of the H3N2 vaccine. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used to quantify the HA content, and the mass spectrometer offered a high level of selectivity31. However, the mass spectrometer is not easy to use for controlling and inspecting the operation32. Using the UV detector and the mass spectrometer at the same time will be more efficient than using them independently. In this study, the solid formulation showed improved stability. Trehalose contributed to improved thermal stability, but changes in trehalose content produced no noticeable differences in stability.Table 1 HA content measured by HPLC and ELISA by exposure at 25 °C and 40 °C for 24 h after 24 h of drying process at 25 °C.Full size tableImmune response of H3N2 microneedle vaccines in miceAs shown in Fig. 5, BALB/c mice were immunized intramuscularly or transdermally with 19–20 A/KS/17 H3N2 vaccine. When the microneedle and IM groups immunized by 2019–20 seasonal H3N2 influenza (19–20 A/KS/17) vaccine were challenged with the mouse-adapted 2015–16 seasonal H3N2 influenza virus (15–16 A/SW/13), all microneedle and IM groups excluding the PBS group displayed complete cross-protection. Minor weight loss was observed in the microneedle group and the IM group in comparison to the MOCK group, but differences between the groups were not significant. In the PBS group, body weight declined by up to 70% of the initial weight (Fig. 6a). There was no statistically significant difference between the IM, MN-Tre20, and MN-Tre100 groups with respect to cross-protective response of the vaccine. In addition, although the epidemic periods of the 19–20 A/KS/17 and the 15–16 A/SW/13 viruses differ, they all belong to the same 3C.3a clade; thus, variations in antigenicity were not significant, resulting in a sufficient cross-protective immune response. In another study, when the influenza vaccine was delivered intradermally using microneedles, microneedle patches induced superior influenza-specific functional antibody titers, and improves the Th1 responses33.Figure 5Brief schedule of in vivo experiment. BALB/c mice were immunized intradermally with 19–20 A/KS/17 H3N2 microneedle vaccines (3 μg/mouse) or intramuscularly with vaccine formulations (3 μg/mouse). Mice were infected with the mouse-adapted 15–16 A/SW/13 H3N2 virus at 3 weeks after vaccination (50MLD50, 30 μl).Full size imageFigure 6(a) Body weight change and (b) survival rate monitored for 14 days after challenge with mouse-adapted 15–16 A/SW/13 H3N2 virus in mice. MN-Tre20: Group administered transdermally with 20 times the amount of trehalose compared to the HA content of the vaccine, MN-Tre100: Group administered transdermally with 100 times the amount of trehalose compared to the HA content of the vaccine. IM: Group administered vaccine through intramuscular injection.

(d) Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers of 19–20 A/KS/17 H3N2 vaccine microneedle and IM groups mouse sera at 14 days after challenge against A/PE/09 H3N2 virus, A/TX/12 H3N2, and A/SW/13 H3N2 virus.Full size imageCross-protective immune responses of H3N2 microneedle vaccinesIn the case of PRNT analysis of the 14 days post-infection (DPI) mouse serum, neutralizing antibody titers of the IM and microneedle groups vaccinated with the 19–20 A/KS/17 H3N2 microneedle vaccines were higher than in the PBS group (Fig. 6c), which corresponded with our results of body weight loss and survival rate (Fig. 6a,b). Also, the neutralizing antibody titers of the microneedle group and the IM group in general were not statistically different. As a result of the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay, it was confirmed that the antibody titer was lower than the PRNT results. However, it showed a tendency similar to the PRNT result that the HI titer of MN-Tre100 was the highest compared with other groups (Fig. 6c,d).The 2010–12 seasonal H3N2 influenza virus (10–12 A/PE/09), the 2014–15 seasonal H3N2 influenza virus (14–15 A/TX/12), and the 15–16 A/SW/13 belong to 1 clade, 3C.1 clade, and 3C.3a clade, respectively. The 19–20 A/KS/17 H3N2 microneedle vaccine (3C.3a clade) showed low immunogenicity against the 10–12 A/PE/09 and the 14–15 A/TX/12 due to their antigenic distance. Although the epidemic periods of the 19–20 A/KS/17 and the 15–16 A/SW/13 were different, they belong to the same 3C.3a clade. Thus, the cross-protective immune responses of these 3C.3a microneedle and IM groups were higher when compared to that of other viruses. Both microneedle and IM administration of the H3N2 vaccine showed comparable cross-protective immune responses. Split influenza vaccine in this study also contains NP apart from HA. Influenza NP induces antibodies as well as CTL which play a role in cross-protection34. However, a recent study revealed that more than 80% of plasmablasts induced in response to the influenza split vaccine are HA-specific, 1–2% of those are NA specific and the remaining cells have other targets, such as NP and M35. It suggests that the immune response to HA dominates the majority of immune response to the influenza split vaccine.ConclusionsHA content measured by HPLC analysis was comparable to that measured using ELISA, and H3N2 microneedle vaccines could be prepared without the use of a standard antibody. The use of solid vaccines displayed greater thermal stability than the conventional liquid vaccines when comparing the solid H3N2 microneedle vaccine formulation to the liquid H3N2 vaccine. The H3N2 microneedle vaccine formulation was successfully administered intradermally, and 71% of the coating layer was dissolved within 30 min, with the vaccine rapidly diffusing into the skin. Administration of the 19–20 A/KS/17 microneedle vaccine elicited cross-protection comparable to the results of IM administration according to survival rate and body weight changes in mice. Both the microneedle and IM groups showed cross-protective immune responses against the mouse-adapted 15–16 A/SW/13 virus. With regards to cross-protection efficacy, antigenic distance proved to be a more important variable than route of administration. The 19–20 A/KS/17 microneedle vaccine provided excellent immunity against the 15–16 A/SW/13 as it is in the same clade as the 19–20 A/KS/17, whereas the 10–12 A/PE/09 and the 14–15 A/TX/12 had relatively low cross-protective immune responses most likely due to their antigenic distance. Overall, the use of HPLC may prove to be an effective method for rapid preparation of seasonal H3N2 influenza microneedle vaccines as well as being an alternative solution to combat antigenic variants.MethodsConventional influenza vaccineThe 19–20 A/KS/17 mono-valent H3N2 seasonal vaccine was obtained from Il-Yang Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Yongin, Republic of Korea). The vaccine solution consists of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and H3N2 vaccine antigen, and the HA content of the vaccine was 30%.; there were no other additives in solution. PBS and trehalose were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Polylactic acid (PLA) was purchased from Lactel (Birmingham, AL). Carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) was purchased from Howon (Gyeonggi-do, South Korea). Porcine skin was purchased from Cronex (Seongnam, Korea).Preparation of H3N2 microneedle vaccineThe master mold of the microneedles was manufactured by the micromilling method. The master mold was filled with a 10:1 mixture of poly-di-methylsiloxane (PDMS) and a curing agent, and after air bubbles were removed in a vacuum chamber, the PDMS was cured in an oven at 70 °C for 1 h. PLA microneedles were manufactured by placing PLA pellets on the cured PDMS mold, melting them in an oven at 190 °C (VOS-301, EYELA, Tokyo). The coating solution was composed of CMC and trehalose. The 19–20 A/KS/17 H3N2 vaccine solution was concentrated to 2 mg/ml using an Amicon Ultra-0.5 Centrifugal filter device (Amicon Ultra 10 K, Billerica, MA) and a microcentrifuge (GYROZEN, Gimpo, Korea). The amount of trehalose was 20 or 100 times that of HA to assess the efficacy of stabilizer, and the concentration of CMC in the final coating solution was 6% (w/w). The coating solution was loaded in a 600 μm deep coating well, and the H3N2 formulation was applied to the uncoated PLA MNS using the dip-coating method. The composition of two solid formulations with trehalose was: H3N2:trehalose:CMC = 1:20:50 and 1:100:50, respectively. The amount of H3N2 loaded per microneedle array patch was measured by the Bradford protein assay after putting the coated microneedles in 1 ml of PBS and dissolving the H3N2 formulation for 30 min (n = 5). The detailed morphology of the coated microneedles and the uniformity of the coating amount over the array were also observed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, JSM-7001F, JEOL, Ltd, Tokyo, Japan).Puncture performance of microneedles for observation of successful insertionTrypan blue microneedles were prepared using the same coating method as that for the H3N2 microneedle vaccines. The trypan blue-coated microneedle array patch was applied to the full porcine skin (2 × 2 cm, about 5 mm thick) with force of 4.5–5 kg for 60 s. The number of blue dots was counted after imaging the porcine skin surface using a stereo microscope (Leica THUNDER model organism imaging system, Wetzlar, Germany). Puncture performance is the ratio of the number of blue holes to the total number of microneedles. The porcine skin was frozen with liquid nitrogen, and the blue dots were cut with a microtome. The image of cross-sections was taken with a stereo microscope.Delivery efficiency of H3N2 microneedles for measurement of predetermined dose of vaccineIn order to measure the amount of the coated layer with H3N2 vaccine delivered into the skin, microneedles were coated with a formulation containing the model drug FITC-dextran (MW: 70 kDa) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and they were attached to porcine skin at 37 °C for 30 min. After the microneedles were removed, the insertion site was gently wiped with a dry cotton swab. To quantify the amount of FITC-dextran on the skin surface, the microneedles and the swab were placed in 1 ml of PBS separately overnight. The amount of FITC-dextran was measured by comparison with a calibration curve at 490 nm of excitation wavelength and 520 nm of emission wavelength using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Multi-label Plate Reader, PerkinElmer, Boston, USA).Dissolution of coating layer and diffusion of model drug in skinTo quantify the diffusion profile of H3N2 in the skin over time, FITC-dextran (MW: 70 kDa) was used as a model drug with a molecular weight similar to that of the H3N2 antigen (MW: 75 kDa). At 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210, 240, 270, 300, and 330 min after microneedle administration, the distribution of fluorescence of FITC-dextran in the skin was observed using a confocal microscope (Ex: 490 nm/Em:520 nm, ECLIPSE TE2000-E, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Sequential z-stack images were captured at 15-μm-depth intervals from the skin surface to a depth of 840 μm. Analysis was performed using a plot profile of Image J (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) of fluorescent signal intensity in confocal z-stacks obtained along the inserted microneedles.Measurement of HA content of H3N2 vaccines using HPLCThe liquid vaccine was placed at 4 °C or at 40 °C for 24 h. The coating solution with the same composition as the coating layer was dried at 25 °C for 24 h to obtain the dried film and then the dried film was placed at 4 °C or 40 °C for 24 h. After exposure at two temperature, the solidified film was redissolved and the HA content was measured by ELISA and HPLC (Table 2). The thermal stability of the solidified 19–20 A/KS/17 H3N2 microneedle vaccine was evaluated. Since a large amount of sample was required for accurate analysis of HA content by repeated experiments, H3N2 vaccine film was prepared by spreading coating vaccine solution on the PLA disk11. Three types of H3N2 vaccine film were prepared from three kinds of solutions. The composition of the three H3N2 coating solutions is summarized in Table 2. The three solutions (each 166 μl) were dropped on three separates flat 1 cm2 PLA disks and spread over each disk. Solidified film was obtained by drying the coating solutions at 25 °C for 24 h. Then the thermal stability of the H3N2 microneedle vaccines was determined by storing the samples at 4 °C or 40 °C for 24 h (Table 1). Samples were dissolved in PBS at 4 °C overnight for measurement of HA content. 4 °C stored H3N2 liquid vaccine was positive control. To set the calibration curve, the 19–20 A/KS/17 H3N2 vaccine was diluted with PBS to prepare standards with the range of 56 to 449 μg/ml of concentration. A zwittergent 3–14 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) solution (10% w/w) was added to standard and sample solutions to achieve a 1% concentration of zwittergent in the mixture. Then TPCK-trypsin (Thermo-Fisher, Waltham, MA) was added and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. After centrifugation (1000g, 4 °C, 5 min) using a microcentrifuge (GYROZEN, Gimpo, Korea), the supernatant was harvested and the remnant was removed. Then 500 mM of dithiothreitol (DTT) was added to the solution for a 25 mM DTT in the mixture, and then the mixture was maintained at 90 °C for 5 min. The active HA1 protein peak was selectively obtained by analyzing the pretreated samples by reverse phase-liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC, Agilent 1200 series, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Column Poros R1/10 (2.1 mm × 100 mm) was maintained at 65 °C and samples were stored at 4 °C before injection. Mobile phase A was 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and 5% acetonitrile in water, and mobile phase B was 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and 25% methanol in acetonitrile. The flow rate was 0.8 ml/min, and the total run time was set to 25 min. The injection volume of the sample was 40 μl and the sample was detected at 214 nm by UV detector36,37,38.Table 2 Information on H3N2 vaccine films for stability test using RP-HPLC and ELISA analysis.Full size tableMeasurement of HA content of H3N2 vaccines using ELISAA 10% (w/v) solution of zwittergent 3–14 was added to the sample, and the mixture was stored at 25 °C for 30 min. After the pretreatment process was completed, 100 μl of the 19–20 A/KS/17 H3N2 vaccine was applied to a Nunc-Immuno™ MicroWell™ 96 well solid plate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and samples were stored at 4 °C overnight. Group 2 IAV27 universal antibody 4F11 was used as the primary antibody, and HRP-conjugated goat anti mouse IgG (Southern Biotechnology, Birmingham, AL) was used as the secondary antibody. The absorbance of the plate was measured at 450 nm using a Synergy H1 hybrid multimode microplate reader (BioTek Instruments Inc, Winooski, VT)39.In vivo animal experimentAll experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Korea University (KOREA-2018-0057) and conducted in accordance with the Korea University Guidelines, which are based on the National Institutes of Health’s Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and with the ARRIVE guidelines. Female BALB/c mice (4–6 weeks old; Orient Bio, Seongnam, Republic of Korea) were vaccinated using the 19–20 A/KS/17 H3N2 microneedle vaccines based on the schedule (Fig. 5). After hair was removed from the backs of the mice, microneedle vaccines were administered for 10 s and fixed using a clamp for an additional 30 min. At 3 weeks after vaccination, the mouse-adapted 15–16 A/SW/13 H3N2 virus was challenged through the nasal cavity (50MLD50, 30 μl). Weight change and survival rate were checked daily for 14 days after the challenge inoculation40,41. Mice who lost 25% or more of their original body weight were considered experimentally dead and were euthanized. PBS was administered intramuscularly to a negative control group. To evaluate cross-reactivity by the HI assay and the PRNT test, mouse serum was collected at 14 days after mouse challenge inoculation with the virus and the test was performed42,43. The 19–20 A/KS/17 H3N2 vaccine (3C.3a clade) was used for vaccination. A three season virus was used for the PRNT test. The 10–12 A/PE/09 H3N2 virus virus (NIBSC code: 09/208) used for PRNT is 1 clade, the 14–15 A/TX/12 H3N2 virus (NIBSC code: 12/298) is 3C.1 clade, and the 15–16 A/SW/13 H3N2 virus (obtained from KCDC) virus is 3C.3a clade. After reacting with the same amount of virus as the serum obtained from the mouse groups, the cells were infected and the maximum dilution factor that reduced plaque formation by 50% or more was compared to the maximum dilution factor of the control group. Serum was also obtained from unimmunized mice that were established as a MOCK group (Table 3).Table 3 Information on challenge test using 19–20 A/KS/17 H3N2 microneedle vaccines against different-year H3N2 viruses using the measurements of body weight change, survival rate, and PRNT test. MNs microneedles, IM intramuscular administration, PRNT plaque reduction neutralization test.Full size tableStatistical methodA two-tailed Student's t test (α = 0.05) was performed when comparing two different conditions, and ANOVA was used when comparing multiple groups. Values of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Airway epithelial cells play a vital role in the early defence against viruses via their barrier and immune functions. We investigated viral replication and immune responses in SARS-CoV-2-infected bronchial epithelial cells from healthy paediatric (n = 6; 2.5–5.6 years old) and adult (n = 4; 47–63 years old) subjects and compared cellular responses following infection with SARS-CoV-2 or Influenza A H1N1. While infection with either virus triggered robust transcriptional interferon responses, including induction of type I (IFNB1) and type III (IFNL1) interferons, markedly lower levels of interferons and inflammatory proteins (IL-6, IL-8) were released following SARS-CoV-2 compared to H1N1 infection. Only H1N1 infection caused disruption of the epithelial layer. Interestingly, H1N1 infection resulted in sustained upregulation of SARS-CoV-2 entry factors FURIN and NRP1. We did not find any differences in the epithelial response to SARS-CoV-2 infection between paediatric and adult cells. Overall, SARS-CoV-2 had diminished potential to replicate, affect morphology and evoke immune responses in bronchial epithelial cells compared to H1N1.

While H1N1pdm09, the influenza A virus responsible for the 2009 pandemic, can cause severe disease in both children and adults1, detrimental outcomes of COVID-19 are more prominent in adults, with roughly 20% having developed severe or critical disease during the first wave of COVID-192,3. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2-infected children typically remain asymptomatic or experience mild to moderate symptoms, and severe disease or fatality are rare4,5,6. Some studies propose that, in addition to decreased severity, susceptibility to infection is also reduced in children compared to adults7,8,9, but the potential mechanisms underlying these discrepancies remain poorly understood. Entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells is dependent on angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which acts as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, and the protease transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2)10. In addition, other host factors, such as cathepsin L, furin proteases and neuropilins, have been ascribed important roles in the pre-activation and entry of SARS-CoV-211,12,13,14,15. Decreased expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry-related genes in children compared to adults has been described16,17, offering a potential explanation for differing susceptibility to infection, but reports are conflicting and differences in the expression of these host factors between children and adults have not been confirmed in other studies18,19,20,21.The airway epithelium acts as an important first line of defence against respiratory viruses, not only by providing a physical barrier between the external environment and the internal milieu, but also via the release of antiviral and pro-inflammatory mediators22. Airway epithelial cells express a range of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), such as the endosomal Toll-like receptors (TLRs) TLR3, TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9 and the cytoplasmic receptors retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5), which allow them to sense viruses and initiate the antiviral interferon response. Upon viral recognition, airway epithelial cells constitute an early source of type I and III interferons (IFNs), which act to rapidly establish an antiviral state via the induction of hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). In particular, type I IFNs are crucial in the successful defence against respiratory viruses such as influenza virus23, and mounting evidence suggests that the early type I IFN response is also central to the response to SARS-CoV-224,25,26.In addition to their role in initiating antiviral responses, both nasal and bronchial epithelial cells are also considered primary portals of entry for SARS-CoV-227, not least due to their expression of both ACE2 and TMPRSS228. Air–liquid interface (ALI) cultures of primary airway epithelial cells are an ideal model for the study of viral infections, as they form a polarised, highly differentiated mucociliary layer representative of the in vivo airway wall29 and retain donor disease characteristics such as age or disease status30,31,32. Accordingly, ALI cultures have been widely used to investigate responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection15,33,34,35,36. However, a detailed characterisation of SARS-CoV-2 infection in paediatric airway epithelial cells compared to adult cells is lacking. While some groups have also used infection with H1N1 as a comparator for SARS-CoV-236,37,38, an approach that has revealed differences in the interferon induction between the two viruses, these studies have been restricted to analysis of gene expression and early time points. We hypothesised that the disparate severity of COVID-19 in children and adults could be explained by intrinsic differences in airway epithelial cells from these groups and that SARS-CoV-2 and H1N1 would evoke distinct responses in these cells We infected ALI cultures of primary bronchial epithelial cells from healthy children (n = 6) and adults (n = 4) with an early-lineage clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2 (England/IC19/2020) or the pandemic strain of H1N1 (A/England/195/2009) to directly compare susceptibility to infection and epithelial antiviral immune responses according to age and virus. We monitored productive infection using plaque assays and immunofluorescence staining for SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein up until 9 days post-infection (dpi). Interferon and inflammatory responses were assessed at mRNA and protein level, and we measured gene expression levels of SARS-CoV-2 entry-related factors and receptors involved in SARS-CoV-2 recognition both at baseline and in response to viral infection.ResultsBronchial epithelial cells from paediatric and adult donors displayed comparable cellular composition and SARS-CoV-2 entry factor expressionWe aimed to study whether differences in COVID-19 susceptibility and severity between children and adults might be explained by intrinsically disparate epithelial cell responses to infection. To this end, we collected bronchial epithelial cells from six healthy children (median age 4.6 years) and four healthy adults (median age 52.5 years; Table 1). There were no differences between nasal and bronchial epithelial cells from paediatric donors with respect to cell morphology, replication of SARS-CoV-2 or interferon response to infection (Supplementary Fig. 1A–C), and therefore bronchial epithelial cells were used as a model of the airway epithelium throughout this study.Table 1 Donor demographics.Full size tableWhen cultured at air–liquid interface and fully differentiated, epithelial cells from both age groups showed similar morphology, characterised by the presence of basal cells (KRT5+), goblet cells (MUC5AC+) and ciliated cells (acetylated alpha-tubulin+, Fig. 1a), and no differences in the expression of genes related to epithelial cell subsets or tight junction formation (TJP1) were observed between the groups (Fig. 1b). Epithelial height varied slightly between donors of both groups (Fig. 1c). We also examined the expression levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, two cell surface proteins required for SARS-CoV-2 entry, as well as further SARS-CoV-2 entry-related genes (CTSL, FURIN, NRP1 and NRP2), and found all of them to be expressed at comparable levels between groups (Fig. 1d), suggesting similar susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 entry. ACE2 expression was further confirmed at the protein level by immunofluorescence staining, where it was detected across the entire cell layer (Fig. 1e), indicating its expression by ciliated cells, basal cells and at least a proportion of goblet cells (Supplementary Fig. 2). Lastly, we measured expression levels of DDX58 (encoding RIG-I) and IFIH1 (encoding MDA5), two PRRs proven (MDA5) or speculated (RIG-I) to be important in the recognition of SARS-CoV-220,35,39. While both genes were detectable in uninfected cells, there were no differences in expression levels between paediatric and adult cells (Fig. 1f). Overall, our analysis did not reveal any intrinsic differences between paediatric and adult cells that would be expected to result in disparate susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 entry or capacity for viral recognition.Fig. 1: Bronchial epithelial cells from paediatric and adult donors displayed comparable cellular composition and SARS-CoV-2 entry factor expression.a Representative images of H&E or immunofluorescence staining of uninfected bronchial epithelial cells from paediatric and adult donors.

To investigate which epithelial subtypes were infected by SARS-CoV-2, we performed immunofluorescence staining for SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (NP) in cell layers at 3 or 5 dpi (Fig. 2a, b). The majority of SARS-CoV-2 NP signal did not co-localise with either KRT5 or MUC5AC signal. These data, coupled with the apical location of the SARS-CoV-2 NP staining suggest that ciliated, not basal or goblet cells, were the primary site of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also noticed a clear increase in the number of infected cells between 3 and 5 dpi (Fig. 2a, b), indicative of continued replication of the virus, which was further confirmed by performing plaque assays on apical washes. Release of infectious SARS-CoV-2 particles from infected cells peaked at around 3–5 dpi and remained detectable throughout the duration of the experiment (9 dpi; Fig. 2c). In line with comparable expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry and pattern recognition receptors, we did not observe any differences between paediatric and adult cells regarding viral replication at any stage during the infection (Fig. 2c). Notably, levels of infectious particles released from H1N1-infected cells were several log-fold higher than from SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, especially at the earliest time point (1 dpi), indicating a better ability of H1N1 to replicate in bronchial epithelial cell cultures compared to SARS-CoV-2, at least for these donors and virus strains.Fig. 2: Age did not distinguish epithelial susceptibility and immune responses to SARS-CoV-2, which were minimal compared to H1N1.a, b Representative images of immunofluorescence staining for SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (NP) (magenta), MUC5AC (yellow) and KRT5 (cyan) in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells at 3 (A) or 5 (B) days post-infection (dpi).

Each data point represents one treatment of one donor.Full size imageIn addition to viral titres, we also compared immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection between paediatric and adult cells (Figs. 3–5). Principal component analysis (PCA) of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells based on 121 variables measured in this study, comprising viral titres, gene expression levels and concentrations of secreted proteins at five different time points, showed a complete overlap between paediatric and adult donors (Fig. 2d), implying that in our subjects, age is unlikely to be a driver of heterogeneity between donors. Our data may suggest that paediatric and adult airway epithelial cells were indistinguishable in their response to infection with SARS-CoV-2 within our experimental setup. However, the inability to detect differences between age groups may also be explained by the limited sample size. We also employed PCA to compare all experimental conditions across the gene expression and protein data collected in this study (Fig. 2e). This analysis revealed stark differences between SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, which partly overlapped with uninfected cells, and H1N1-infected cells, which displayed a clear separation from the other conditions, suggesting a much greater ability of H1N1 to evoke epithelial cell responses compared to SARS-CoV-2.Fig. 3: Infection of epithelial cells with SARS-CoV-2 did not alter gross cellular morphology.a Representative images of H&E staining of paediatric or adult bronchial epithelial cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 (CoV-2), H1N1 or treated with medium (ctrl) at 3 and 5 days post-infection (dpi). b, c Gene expression analysis by qPCR of infected bronchial epithelial cells.

We used a combination of traditional haematoxylin and eosin staining and gene expression analysis of cell layers to assess the consequences of infection on overall morphology and epithelial integrity. While infection with H1N1 severely affected the structure and height of the cell layer (Fig. 3a) and further led to reduced expression of ciliated, basal and goblet cell genes (Fig. 3b), SARS-CoV-2 did not alter gross cell morphology and even resulted in increased levels of TJP1. We also measured the expression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a receptor thought to be important for airway epithelial repair40, as well as its seven ligands: amphiregulin (AREG), betacellulin (BTC), epidermal growth factor (EGF; not shown), epigen (EPGN; not detected), epiregulin (EREG), heparin-binding EGF-like (HBEGF) and transforming growth factor-alpha (TGFA). While infection with both viruses led to significant increases in ligand expression, the effects of H1N1 infection were wider-ranging and of greater magnitude (Fig. 3c). Taken together, these data suggest that, in comparison to infection with H1N1, SARS-CoV-2 only caused minimal damage and subsequent repair of the epithelium.Infection with SARS-CoV-2 elicited antiviral and pro-inflammatory transcriptional programmes, which were significantly weaker than with H1N1 infectionWe next considered the epithelial immune response. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 strongly induced the expression of type I (IFNB1) and type III (IFNL1) IFNs as well as several ISGs, although peak expression levels resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection were lower than after H1N1 infection (Fig. 4a, b, Fig S3A). Infection with either virus also resulted in an induction of the pro-inflammatory genes CXCL8 (encoding IL-8), IL6 and TNF, albeit to a lesser extent in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells (Fig. 4c). Importantly, however, expression levels of interferon signalling genes as well as pro-inflammatory genes strongly correlated with infectious titres of both viruses in apical washes (Fig. 4d, Supplementary Fig. 3A, B), suggesting that the milder inflammatory response observed in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells may result from lower viral replication in these cells. Apart from slightly elevated expression of IFNB1 and TNF in H1N1-infected adult compared to paediatric cells at 9 dpi (p = 0.016), there were no differences between the age groups.Protein production by epithelial cells in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection was minimal compared to H1N1In addition to the transcriptional response, we also measured proteins secreted by epithelial cells infected with either SARS-CoV-2 or H1N1. As expected, H1N1 infection resulted in release of IFN-β, IFN-λ, IL-6 and IL-8 into the basal media (Fig. 5a, b), of which IL-8 alone was also present in media from uninfected cells (Supplementary Fig. 4A). In contrast, only IFN-λ and IL-8 were detected in media from SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, at levels approximately 5- to 40-fold lower than after H1N1 infection (Fig. 5a, b). To address whether elevated interferon levels in the basal media of H1N1-infected cells might be secondary to increased leakage of apically released protein as a result of damage to the epithelial layer, we also measured levels of IFN-β and IFN-λ in apical washes of infected cells (Supplementary Fig. 4B). Apical release of both interferons in response to SARS-CoV-2, while detectable, fell short of levels measured after H1N1, indicating an overall diminished ability of SARS-CoV-2 to elicit antiviral or pro-inflammatory protein production in bronchial epithelial cells from healthy individuals. In line with this, basolateral protein release after H1N1 infection strongly correlated with viral titres, whereas we found no or only weak correlation between titres and measured protein levels from SARS-CoV-2-infected cells (Fig. 5c)This finding was further supported when levels of 105 cytokines and chemokines were measured in pooled basal media from infected paediatric (n = 4) or adult (n = 4) epithelial cells using a membrane-based protein array, where infection with SARS-CoV-2 had little effect on the proteins detected, whereas H1N1 induced a wide range of analytes (Supplementary Fig. 4B). Overall, these data confirm that, when compared to H1N1, SARS-CoV-2 had a diminished potential to affect epithelial morphology or induce interferon and pro-inflammatory responses at both mRNA and protein level, which may at least in part result from its relatively reduced replication in healthy bronchial epithelial cells.Infection of bronchial epithelial cells with H1N1 resulted in prolonged upregulation of SARS-CoV-2 entry-related genes independent of viral titresFinally, we aimed to investigate whether viral infection can alter the expression of genes involved in SARS-CoV-2 cell entry and could thus potentially affect susceptibility to subsequent infections. As we did not observe any differences between paediatric and adult cells, both groups were pooled for this analysis. While the expression of entry-related genes was largely unaffected by SARS-CoV-2 infection, cells infected with H1N1 showed significantly altered expression of all six genes, with ACE2, FURIN, NRP1 and NRP2 being significantly upregulated compared to uninfected controls at 9 dpi (Fig. 6a). We found FURIN to be of special interest, as its expression was induced early following H1N1 infection and remained consistently elevated through the experiment. FURIN levels did not correlate with viral titres (Fig. 6b), suggesting that expression of this gene is likely controlled by mechanisms distinct from the antiviral and pro-inflammatory response. Similarly, NRP1 expression levels were unchanged at 3 dpi but increased significantly and continuously from 5 dpi. Together, these data indicate that H1N1 infection resulted in sustained upregulation of SARS-CoV-2 entry-related genes in bronchial epithelial cells even after viral titres decreased. If similar events took place in vivo, they may result in an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients recently recovering from influenza.Fig. 6: Infection of bronchial epithelial cells with H1N1 resulted in prolonged upregulation of SARS-CoV-2 entry-related genes independent of viral titres.a Gene expression analysis by qPCR of infected bronchial epithelial cells.

The mechanisms underlying these discrepancies in COVID-19 severity remain poorly understood. Here, we hypothesised that intrinsic differences in the responses of healthy paediatric and adult bronchial epithelial cells to infection with SARS-CoV-2 could explain the differences observed according to age. In order to understand whether susceptibility to infection and immune responses were specific for SARS-CoV-2, we compared it to H1N1. Our characterisation of viral replication and epithelial immune responses following SARS-CoV-2 infection of differentiated bronchial epithelial cells from healthy children and adults showed indistinguishable infection susceptibility and immune responses between paediatric and adult cells. However, we acknowledge that a larger sample size may have revealed age-related differences. SARS-CoV-2 infection induced a robust transcriptional interferon response, which was delayed compared to H1N1 infection, in line with slower viral replication of SARS-CoV-2. Protein production and repair responses were also much lower in SARS-CoV-2- compared to H1N1-infected cells, and only H1N1 infection resulted in changes to the morphology and composition of the epithelial layer.Mounting evidence cements the central role of type I IFNs in the generation of effective responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection, including observations of higher prevalence of loss-of-function mutations or auto-antibodies interfering with type I IFN signalling in patients with life-threatening COVID-1924,25. The benefit of interferon signalling has also been demonstrated in primary airway epithelial cells in vitro, where the application of either type I and III IFNs before or early after infection with SARS-CoV-2 was shown to result in reduced viral burden in both nasal and bronchial epithelial cells35,37,38. A recent study comparing the upper airway transcriptome of healthy uninfected and SARS-CoV-2-infected children and adults using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of nasal swabs reported higher expression of IFIH1 and DDX58 in epithelial cells from children, both at baseline and during the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection20. IFIH1 and DDX58 encode MDA5 and RIG-I, respectively, two PRRs important in the induction of interferon signalling in response to infection with viruses, of which MDA5 was specifically shown to contribute to sensing of SARS-CoV-235,39. As such, a higher expression of the relevant PRRs needed for the induction of IFN signalling might potentially result in faster and stronger antiviral signalling upon infection. In line with this, a study comparing nasopharyngeal swabs from 12 children and 27 adults admitted to the emergency department with SARS-CoV-2 infection found increased levels of interferons, ISGs and pro-inflammatory cytokines in nasal fluids from children compared to adults. This heightened immune response signature aligned with better clinical outcomes21, suggesting children may indeed be more poised to mount an inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 than adults.When we compared the expression of IFIH1 and DDX58 between bronchial epithelial cell cultures collected from healthy children and adults and cultured at air–liquid interface, we did not observe any differences in PRR expression or the ability of the cells to mount an antiviral interferon response to infection with SARS-CoV-2. We cannot exclude that a comparison of nasal rather than bronchial epithelial cells or an increase in sample size would have revealed differences between groups, and potentially even in the ability to control SARS-CoV-2 replication. However, it is more likely that the increased PRR expression levels in children are not an intrinsic feature of paediatric airway epithelia, but rather a result of environmental influences. An increased antiviral interferon signature, including increased expression of PRRs, could be the result of recent respiratory virus infections, which are more common in children compared to adults41. The effects of infection history are not limited to the airway epithelium; a study has reported the existence of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S)-binding antibodies in the serum of individuals not previously exposed to the virus or the vaccine42. These pre-existing antibodies were most commonly found in children and adolescents and are thought to be cross-reactive immunological memory originally mounted in response to other seasonally circulating human coronaviruses, which are more prevalent in children compared to adults43,44.Allowing for a relatively modest sample size, our preliminary findings suggest that disparate disease severity of COVID-19 between children and adults may not be the result of cell-intrinsic differences between paediatric and adult airway epithelia. This interpretation warrants further investigation in future studies that should aim to increase the sample size and include epithelial cells from a wider age range of subjects. Even so, it is unlikely that infection history alone is the deciding factor for disease severity. It is thus important to also consider the contribution of other anatomical sites and cell types. While our model is ideally suited for the detailed characterisation of the normal airway epithelial response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, it is unable to reflect the progression of SARS-CoV-2 to the alveoli, a process associated with the development of severe disease27. Another limitation of the present study is the inability to demonstrate how airway epithelial cells interact with other structural and immune cells and how this may shape the response to infection, including viral clearance. The use of scRNA-seq in samples from individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 has provided some insights into these interactions in the context of diverging COVID-19 susceptibility and severity between children and adults20,45. In addition to differences in epithelial expression of pattern recognition receptors, as discussed above, these studies demonstrated augmented frequencies of diverse lymphocyte populations, such as innate lymphoid cells and various T cell subsets, in children. Ultimately, it is likely that many factors, coupled with their interaction with each other, influence the disparate disease severity in individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2.A stark finding of our study was the pronounced difference between infection with SARS-CoV-2 versus H1N1. SARS-CoV-2 showed much lower release of infectious particles compared to H1N1, suggesting a diminished ability to replicate in airway epithelia. This may explain the longer incubation period of around 6 days for SARS-CoV-246 compared to the much shorter incubation period of 1–4 days for H1N147 in infected individuals. Interestingly, we found no evidence of damage or overt pro-inflammatory responses after SARS-CoV-2 infection, both of which were evident in H1N1-infected cells. This is surprising considering both viruses have similar spectra of disease severity and case fatality rates are estimated to be even higher for COVID-19 compared to influenza48. This suggests that, in contrast to H1N1, the epithelial response to SARS-CoV-2 may be less consequential to disease severity.Early studies of SARS-CoV-2 infection in ALI cultures of bronchial epithelial cells reported an inability of the cells to mount an interferon response to the virus36,37. In contrast, various other reports have more recently demonstrated induction of interferon signalling upon SARS-CoV-2 infection in primary nasal, tracheal and bronchial epithelial cells34,35,38,39,49,50. Of note, interferon and ISG induction was primarily reported during later stages of the infection (around 2–4 dpi) and was delayed and of lower magnitude when compared to infection with Influenza A H1N138 or H3N234, a finding which is replicated in our data. This delay in the onset of the interferon response was hypothesised to result from the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to subvert early interferon induction. Several viral evasion strategies of SARS-CoV-2 have been brought to light. These include the use of double-membrane vesicles for viral RNA synthesis51 and the ability of non-structural proteins and other viral proteins to inhibit interferon induction and signalling52,53 as well as interference with protein translation54,55,56,57. However, our data indicate a strong correlation between levels of infectious viral particles released into the apical wash and gene expression of IFNB1, IFNL1 and several ISGs following infection with either SARS-CoV-2 or H1N1, suggesting that reduced ability of SARS-CoV-2 to replicate in bronchial epithelial cells, rather than its evasion strategies, is the major driver for the delayed interferon response at transcriptional level. Nevertheless, the minimal protein release from SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, both apically and basolaterally, did not match the robust interferon induction elicited at transcriptional level, suggesting that viral interference with protein translation may have occurred.Lastly, we observed that infection with H1N1 resulted in prolonged upregulation of the SARS-CoV-2 entry-related genes FURIN and NRP1 that was not linked to viral titres. Both furin and neuropilin 1 have been shown to potentiate SARS-CoV-2 infectivity11,13,14. It may be that an increased expression of these proteases renders individuals recovering from flu more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Co-infection experiments in primary airway epithelial cells, while beyond the scope of the present study, will be instrumental in supporting this hypothesis. In their absence, however, others have shown influenza A pre-infection to increase the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro58 and mice infected with influenza and subsequently SARS-CoV-2 displayed enhanced disease susceptibility and pathology compared to those infected with SARS-CoV-2 alone58,59. Importantly, a study evaluating 19,256 individuals tested for both influenza and SARS-CoV-2 in England identified a greater risk of death in patients with co-infection compared to those infected with either virus alone60. These findings underscore the absolute need for public policy to urge immunisation against influenza as well as COVID-19.Overall, we demonstrated that intrinsic differences in bronchial epithelial cells from children and adults did not explain the discrepancies in COVID-19 disease susceptibility and severity seen between those groups. However, when comparing two viruses that have both resulted in pandemics, there was a stark difference in epithelial damage and immune responses. In addition to a previously described delay in induction of interferon signalling, which we were able to link to delayed replication, SARS-CoV-2 caused no damage to the epithelial layer and displayed an overall diminished capacity to evoke epithelial immune responses at both mRNA and protein level. In contrast, H1N1 infection resulted in rapid viral replication, robust epithelial damage, altered morphology of the cell layer and markedly greater immune responses.MethodsPatient recruitment and samplingEthical approval for sample collection was granted by the Research Ethics Committee (17/LO/0013 and 15/SC/0101) and all patients or parents provided informed written consent.Children aged 2–5 with no history of wheezing or other respiratory pathology (n = 6) (Table 1) were recruited as part of the Breathing Together study as previously described61. Bronchial epithelial cells were collected by blind endobronchial brushing from children undergoing anaesthesia for an elective surgical procedure requiring clinically indicated intubation, and nasal epithelial cells were collected from the same donors as previously described61. Healthy adults (n = 4) (Table 1) were recruited for bronchoscopies, during which bronchial brushes were taken from the right mainstem bronchus. Brushes were collected in DMEM media containing penicillin (100 U/ml) and streptomycin (100 µg/ml; all Gibco). Cells were detached by agitation and then expanded for two passages in Airway Epithelial Cell Growth Medium (Promocell) containing 100 µg/ml Primocin (InvivoGen) in flasks coated with 30 µg/ml (bronchial) or 100 µg/ml (nasal epithelial cells) bovine Type I Collagen Solution (BioMatrix) before cryopreservation.Air–liquid interface culture of epithelial cellsCryopreserved cells were expanded in Airway Epithelial Cell Growth Medium containing penicillin and streptomycin before seeding onto collagen-coated (30 µg/ml type I collagen) 24-well Transwell inserts (polyethylene terephthalate membrane with 0.4 µm pores; Corning) at a density of 3 × 104 per insert. A 1:1 mix of Airway Epithelial Growth Medium (without the Triiodo-L-thyronine supplement) containing penicillin and streptomycin and DMEM (high glucose, GlutaMAX™, pyruvate; Gibco) containing penicillin and streptomycin, 25 mM HEPES (Gibco) and 1.5 µg/ml BSA (Sigma) was used for maintenance of the cells during seeding and submerged phase of the culture, with 200 µl and 500 µl of medium in the apical and basal compartment, respectively. Medium was changed every 2–4 days.Upon confluency, apical medium was removed, and the basal medium was replaced with PneumaCult™-ALI Medium containing 0.0004% Heparin, 0.48 µg/ml hydrocortisone (all Stemcell) and penicillin and streptomycin. Basal medium was refreshed every 2–4 days until cells were fully differentiated (4–9 weeks) and where necessary, mucus was removed by addition of 100 µl PBS to the apical compartment for 5 min before removal.At least 48 h before infection, hydrocortisone was withdrawn from the media and cells were cultured without hydrocortisone for the entirety of the experiment. Apical washes and basal media were collected 24 hours after infection and then every 48 h. For apical washes, 200 µl of PBS were added to the apical compartment and collected after 10 min of incubation at room temperature.Viral stocks, infection, and determination of viral titresAll work involving the use of live SARS-CoV-2 or H1N1 was carried out in the Containment Level 3 (CL3) or Containment Level 2 (CL2) laboratories (St. Mary’s, Imperial College London), respectively. Stocks of SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2/England/IC19/2020) and Influenza H1N1 (A/England/195/2009) were propagated in Vero-E6 or MDCK cells, respectively.Prior to infection, the apical compartment was washed once with PBS and the basal media was replaced. A cell density of 2.5 × 105 cells per insert was assumed. 2.5 × 103 PFU SARS-CoV-2 (MOI 0.01), 2.5 × 102 PFU H1N1 (MOI 0.001) or serum-free DMEM were added to the apical compartment in a total volume of 100 µl and cells were incubated for 1 hr at 37 °C/5% CO2 before apical liquid was removed and cells were returned to the incubator.Viral titres of SARS-CoV-2 and H1N1 in apical washes were determined using plaque assays in Vero-E6 or MDCK cells, respectively.Protein mediator analysisAll samples were irradiated prior to analysis to allow work to be conducted outside of CL2 or CL3 facilities. Levels of IFN-β, IFN-λ 1/3, IL-6 and IL-8 were measured in basal media or apical washes from at least three inserts per condition using DuoSet ELISA kits (R&D Systems) according to manufacturer’s recommendation. Levels of 105 cytokines were measured in pooled basal media from four paediatric or adult donors, respectively, using the Proteome Profiler Human XL Cytokine Array Kit (R&D Systems) according to manufacturer’s recommendation.Gene expression analysisTotal RNA was extracted from two Transwell inserts per condition using the Maxwell® RSC simplyRNA Blood kit on the Maxwell® RSC instrument (both Promega) and transcribed into cDNA using the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit (Applied Biosystems). Expression of genes of interest relative to the expression of two housekeeping genes (ATP5B, YWHAZ) was determined using TaqMan™ Fast Advanced reagents on a ViiA 7 Real-Time PCR system (both Applied Biosystems). TaqMan™ assay IDs are listed in Table 2.Table 2 TaqMan™ assays used for gene expression analysis.Full size tableHistology and immunofluorescence stainingWhole inserts were fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. Membranes were excised from inserts and embedded in 4% low melting point agarose (Thermo Scientific) prior to paraffin embedding and sectioning at 4 µm thickness. Paraffin embedding, sectioning and haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining were performed by Lorraine Lawrence of the Histology facility at Imperial College London. For immunofluorescence staining, slides were subjected to heat-induced antigen retrieval in 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0 prior to blocking in PBS containing 10% donkey serum and 0.1% Tween 20 and incubation with antibodies in 1% BSA in PBS at the concentrations indicated in Table 3. In some instances, DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich) was included as a counterstain for nuclei. Images were acquired using the Aperio VERSA slide scanner (Leica) at a maximum magnification of x40. Epithelial height was measured in H&E-stained sections using ImageScope Software (Leica). Fluorescence images were adjusted for contrast and gamma in ImageScope software before export. Fiji software62 was used to rotate and crop images, apply pseudocolours and add scale bars. For visualisation of overlap between stains, segmentation was applied on inverted single-channel images using the PHANTAST63 plug-in for Fiji and overlapping areas between different colours were identified using the Image Calculator function.Table 3 Antibodies used for immunofluorescence staining.Full size tableData analysis and statisticsAll data processing, analysis and plotting was conducted in R Studio. For statistical analyses, the R stats package was used. When comparing between two groups, exact p values were computed using a two-sided Mann–Whitney test and p values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. For correlations, exact p values and rank correlation coefficients (rho) were calculated using the Spearman method. Principal component analysis was conducted on centred and scaled data and the first two principal components were plotted. Data was visualised using the ggplot2 package. ReferencesJhung, M. A. et al.

Study: The Host Response to Influenza A Virus Interferes with SARS-CoV-2 Replication during Coinfection. Image Credit: Lightspring/Shutterstock Background The influenza A virus (IAV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are two of the most transmissible pathogens that can cause long-lasting harm to public health. While the viruses belong to different virus families with SARS-CoV-2 from the Coronaviridae family and IAV from the Orthomyxoviridae family, they both have displayed remarkable zoonotic potential. Since these viruses have shown efficient capabilities of infecting human airways, various studies have reported the incidence of fatal coinfections. About the study In the present study, researchers assessed the interaction between IAV and SARS-CoV-2 during coinfection in both in vitro and in vivo conditions. The team examined the effect of IAV and SARS-CoV-2 coinfection on viral replication by infecting Vero-E6 cells with individual or both viruses simultaneously. An interferon (IFN)-competent human lung alveolar cell line was employed to evaluate viral replication. Furthermore, the SARS-CoV-2 and IAV infection assessment was performed with single-cloned A549-angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) cells expressing ACE2, the receptor instrumental for SARS-CoV-2 entry. These cells were infected with either both or only IAV or SARS-CoV-2 at a low multiplicity of infection (MOI). The response of the host hamsters to the individual infection as well as coinfection with SARS-CoV-2 and IAV was assessed by intranasally infecting the hosts with either SARS-CoV-2 or IAV or both the viruses at the same time. The team subsequently employed the plaque assay to determine the viral titers corresponding to the IAV and SARS-CoV-2 in the lungs at one, three, five, seven, and 14 days post-infection (dpi). Additionally, the team investigated the mechanism via which IAV interferes with the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in infected hamsters by performing messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) sequencing (mRNA-Seq) seven days after treatment with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or infection with IAV. This facilitated the assessment of differential gene expression observed in the respiratory tract responsible for the reduced SARS-CoV-2 replication. Results The study results showed that cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 displayed a slight delay in viral replication when IAV was also present. At 24 hours post-infection (hpi), SARS-CoV-2 showed replication at lower viral titers in the coinfected cells than in cells infected only with SARS-CoV-2. However, the team observed similar viral titers between the individually infected and the coinfected Vero E6 cells at 48 hpi and 72 hpi. On the other hand, viral titers for IAV were unchanged at all the time points tested, irrespective of the presence of SARS-CoV-2. Related StoriesCould vitamin D help COVID-19 patients?

Furthermore, the viral titers for IAV were significantly lesser in the SARS-CoV-2 coinfected A549-ACE2 cells at all the time points. Altogether, this showed that IAV coinfection could result in a reduction in SARS-CoV-2 replication in the Vero E6 as well as the A549-ACE2 cells. Furthermore, infection of hamsters with either SARS-CoV-2 or IAV resulted in significant viral replication in the respiratory organs, stimulating both adaptive and innate immune responses. The plaque assay revealed that each virus showed robust replication in the respiratory tracts of the infected hamsters, with the highest viral titers observed at three dpi after individual infection. Among the coinfected hosts, the viral titers in the lungs infected by SARS-CoV-2 were similar to those observed in individually infected hamsters at one dpi. However, animals individually infected with COVID-19 displayed lower SARS-CoV-2 titers at three dpi followed by fast viral clearance by five dpi. However, the team observed infectious viral particles in 100% and 25% of the hamsters that were individually infected with SARS-CoV-2 at five dpi and seven dpi, respectively. Interestingly, viral titers corresponding to IAV were not altered by the presence of SARS-CoV-2 at any of the time points. This suggested that SARS-CoV-2 and IAV coinfection resulted in lower SARS-CoV-2 replication levels without any variation in IAV replication. Furthermore, hamsters that were either coinfected or were infected only with SARS-CoV-2 displayed a delayed lack of weight gain compared to hamsters that were infected with IAV. After seven days of injection, mRNA-seq revealed that among PBS-treated and IAV-infected hamsters, there were a total of 25 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). This indicated that the response against IAV had mostly returned to the baseline levels. Among the genes found to be slightly enriched, the team observed low levels of immune priming and increased concentrations of macrophages. Furthermore, the ISG15 and IRF7 genes were highly expressed in the lungs at seven dpi. This indicated that the IFN response elicited by IAV infection was likely to remain at low levels even after viral clearance. Conclusion Overall, the study findings showed that the host response to the SARS-CoV-2 and IAV coinfection was similar to that observed for SARS-CoV-2 alone.

Noubar Afeyan/The Boston Globe/Getty Images In a busy 24 hours of launches, Flagship Pioneering announced Apriori Bio, which utilizes artificial intelligence to predict virus activity and variant formation, including in COVID-19. Octavia, the AI platform developed by Apriori, has the ability to infer the potential variants that might come out of a single viral variant, as well as define the antibodies that may protect against its current and future versions. The goal is to have a proactive approach, hence the name “a priori” (which means before things appear), to virus management through machine learning. Apriori Bio, founded in 2020, has Flagship’s sole financial backing, with the leading venture capital firm committing $50 million to its research and development efforts. How much Apriori Bio and Octavia are worth is unknown to date, but the company said it has adequate funds to support its exploration and expansion plans. It is also vague on the stage of research it is currently at. Apriori is part of the rapidly expanding Flagship ecosystem, which consists of 41 companies, including Moderna, Denali Therapeutics and Seres Therapeutics. Through AI, Octavia models can learn how virus variants behave and pinpoint those that might bring the most significant threat. This will enable researchers and scientists to create variant-proof antibody drugs and vaccines that are preventive instead of simply reactive. The tools and datasets from the platform generate real-time pathogen intelligence that can aid in the creation of effective public health policies. “The world was brought to its knees two years ago by the COVID-19 pandemic. We must imagine a future in which we secure our health instead of resigning ourselves to being unprepared for viral threats. Apriori Bio’s technology platform can be used to develop vaccines and antibody drugs for viral variants that have yet to emerge, taking a leap toward shielding humanity from existing and future viral threats,” Noubar Afeyan, Ph.D., founder and chief executive officer of Flagship Pioneering and co-founder and chairman of Apriori Bio said in a statement. Apriori Bio is currently exploring potential partnerships with private firms and government agencies while building up its capacity to develop and produce vaccines and antibody therapies to combat a wide range of viruses. Included in its list of priorities are those that the World Health Organization classifies as the greatest threat, including influenza, HIV and SARS-CoV-2. “By integrating and learning from evolutionary and experimental data at unprecedented scale, Apriori can infer the behavior of and mitigate the danger posed by existing and future viral variants. Using Octavia, we can design uniquely effective new medicines and support public health by predicting the impact of emerging variants in real time,” Lovisa Afzelius, Ph.D., origination partner at Flagship Pioneering and co-Founder and CEO of Apriori commented. Afzelius noted, “Future outbreaks are inevitable, but preparedness is a choice. Apriori shifts the concept of preparedness for viral threats.” Twitter LinkedIn Facebook Email Print Earnings Startups Moderna, Inc. Denali Therapeutics Inc.

Sequencing information provides crucial decision-making information during epidemics and pandemics. On 8-9 June 2022, WHO’s Eastern Mediterranean Regional Office convened a meeting in Egypt with partner organizations and countries to discuss the framework for integrated respiratory pathogen surveillance including the role of genomic surveillance. The regional laboratory focal point set the scene:“Currently, 19 out of the 22 countries in the Eastern Mediterranean Region have genomic sequencing capabilities. A regional network has been established to enable all countries to have access to sequencing, and to strengthen their capacities coherently and collaboratively to be able to detect, investigate and respond to COVID-19 and other emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases with epidemic and pandemic potential.” - Dr Amal Barakat, Regional Laboratory Focal Point, WHOSome highlights from stories shared by countries in the meeting: Morocco Following the significant increase in molecular diagnostic capacity for SARS-CoV-2 in the country enabling up to 250,000 tests per day, the National Influenza Centre at the Ministry of Health (MOH) recognized early that the need for SARS-CoV-2 sequencing was also increasing. To address this, Morocco set up a national consortium of four laboratories – two public and two private – to cover different geographic regions in the country.“The Consortium enables us to address genomic surveillance needs by bringing in the capacities and capabilities of the private sector. This was a major achievement and presents an opportunity for us as we think about the next generation of public health surveillance.” - Professor Hisham Ouzmil, National Influenza Centre, MoroccoOmanThe MOH Central Public Health Laboratory (CPHL) serves as WHO’s regional reference laboratory for COVID-19. The CPHL linked with national and local academic partners to strengthen workforce capacities, increase national genomic surveillance coverage, and develop algorithms for selecting cases for sequencing so that virological trends associated with different sub-populations such as travelers, severely ill patients and cases from different geographic regions could be well understood. “Genomics have helped us to better understand the epidemiology of COVID-19 in Oman. Linking genomic data to epidemiological and clinical data, and analyzing trends from other countries maximizes the utility and power of genomics. We are happy to work with other countries, share our experiences and strengthen collaborations as we learn lessons for future pandemic preparedness.”- Dr Hanan Alkindi, Central Public Health Laboratory, OmanSaudi ArabiaA massive effort was undertaken to expand genomic surveillance so that the viral phylo-dynamics could be understood in all geographic regions of the country and to look at patterns among severe cases, travel-related cases, post-vaccination cases and re-infections. “More than 60,000 SARS-CoV-2 samples have been sequenced from around the country. We have the opportunity to use the capacity established for various public health threats and are ready for future emergencies.” - Dr Ahmed Albarraq, Public Health Authority, Saudi Arabia Outputs from the meeting and reflections from countries on the role of genomics during the COVID-19 pandemic and future emergencies will enable the Region to plan effectively and focus attention on the future of integrated respiratory pathogen surveillance inclusive of genomic surveillance. The regional operational framework for integrated surveillance is being finalized and will be available later this year including the opportunities for genomic surveillance in the context of the recently launched Global Genomic Surveillance Strategy for Pathogens with Pandemic and Epidemic Potential 2022–2032. The 10-year Global strategy will enable countries in the Eastern Mediterranean Region, as well as other regions, to capitalize on the gains made and to solidify the role of genomics in future public health practice.

Volunteers responded to at least one health survey through the CDC's smartphone-based v-safe monitoring system during the study period.The authors noted that current clinical CDC guidance states that COVID-19 vaccines may be given without regard to timing of other vaccines, including during the same vaccination visit. Authorization of COVID-19 vaccine boosters in the United States coincided with the recommended period for flu vaccination, increasing the odds of simultaneous receipt.Fatigue, headache, muscle aches most reportedOf the 981,099 volunteers, 92,023 (9.4%) reported having received simultaneous flu and COVID-19 booster vaccination. Of these participants, 59.7% were female, 40.6% were aged 12 to 49 years, 25.8% were 50 to 64, 27.0% were 65 to 74, and 6.6% were 75 or older.A total of 58.9% of 61,390 participants who simultaneously received the flu vaccine and the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 booster and 68.6% of 30,633 of those who simultaneously received the flu vaccine and the Moderna booster reported systemic adverse reactions.Participants who simultaneously received the flu and Pfizer vaccine (aOR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.10) or the flu and Moderna vaccine (aOR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.08 to 1.14) were slightly more likely to report a systemic reaction than those who received a COVID-19 booster alone.Most reactions were mild or moderate and were reported the day after vaccination. The most common systemic reactions were fatigue, headache, and muscle aches.Less than 1% sought hospital careA total of 19.0% of respondents receiving simultaneous flu and COVID-19 booster vaccination with Pfizer and 26.8% of flu and Moderna recipients reported health effects. Among Pfizer recipients, 15.5% said they couldn't perform routine daily activities, as did 22.2% of Moderna recipients. But less than 1% needed hospital care.Hospital admission data were available for 19 of 22 participants; of them, 10 said their hospitalization was unrelated to vaccination or was reported in error. The remaining patients indicated they were admitted for treatment of excessive vomiting, supraventricular tachycardia, abnormal heart rhythms, chest pain, an autoinflammatory disease exacerbation, kidney infection, low oxygen levels, or stroke.Recipients of simultaneous flu and Pfizer boosters were not more likely than recipients of a booster alone to report a "health impact" within a week of vaccination (aOR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.97 to 1.02), while flu and Moderna vaccine recipients were slightly more likely to report a health impact during the first week (aOR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.08) than recipients of a Moderna booster alone.The researchers said that while simultaneous administration of both vaccines is efficient and may increase uptake of the vaccines, it is associated with a higher risk of systemic adverse events.But in a related commentary, Kathryn Hall, PhD, MPH, of Brigham and Women's Hospital; Valerie Stone, MD, MPH, of the Boston Public Health Commission; and Bisola Ojikuto, MD, MPH, of Massachusetts General Hospital, said that concomitant administration of the flu vaccine and COVID-19 booster could increase the flu vaccination rate, which was only 50.2% during the 2020 to 2021 season."Although logistical challenges may serve as barriers to the implementation of dual vaccination, organizing for provision of both influenza vaccination and COVID vaccination within clinical settings and at community-based nonclinical venues would be advantageous and may increase the likelihood of uptake," they wrote."Given the small increase in rate of adverse events reported by Hause et al, health care systems should be encouraged to develop routine and streamlined processes for coadministration of these vaccinations."

Introduction Have any Viral Diseases yet been Eradicated? The Dahlem Workshop on the Eradication of Infectious Diseases How to Define Eradication? Viral Extinction and The Influenza Virus Are There Measures in Place to Tackle Eradication? References Is it possible to completely eradicate a virus? Eradication is not easy to conceptualize and has been variously defined. Meanwhile, the concept of elimination has been dispensed with, only later to be revived again as virologists grapple with the intractability of a working definition for the concept of eradication. The concept of extinction is much more easily discernible, though surprising in its scope because, as we shall see here, the notion extends to common and longstanding viruses such as influenza. Image Credit: Naeblys/Shutterstock.com Have any Viral Diseases yet been Eradicated? The eradication of disease has been deemed the “holy grail” for health officials, and better health positively impacts ecosystems across the globe (Corona, 2020). In the past, efforts to eradicate malaria, yellow fever, and yaws (which cause severe skin infection) were unsuccessful, though they fostered a better understanding of the complexities of disease control. In 1993, the International Task Force for Disease Eradication assessed over 80 potential infectious disease categories, of which they designated just six as eradicable candidates (Dowdle, 1998). The World Health Organisation (WHO) has since then declared only two viruses to have been officially eradicated thus far; variola virus (VARV), which causes smallpox, and rinderpest virus (RPV), which causes rinderpest (also known as cattle plague). The Dahlem Workshop on the Eradication of Infectious Diseases The Dahlem Workshop on the Eradication of Infectious Diseases convened in March 1997. The workshop addressed critical questions about how to best define eradication according to specific biological criteria; the costs/benefits, the political and societal criteria for eradication, and how eradication programs were to be implemented. The various levels of effort in favor of disease control were defined at the workshop as follows (Dowdle, 1998; Quadros, 2002): Control: the reduction of disease incidence, prevalence, morbidity, and mortality to acceptable levels Elimination of disease: the reduction to zero incidences of disease in a defined geographic area Elimination of infection: reduction to zero incidences of infection caused by a specific agent in a defined geographic area Eradication: permanent reduction to zero worldwide incidences of infection caused by a specific agent Extinction: the specific agent no longer exists in nature or the laboratory. The following year, a meeting was held in Atlanta, USA, whereupon the above definitions were again discussed. Here at the Conference on Global Disease Elimination and Eradication as Public Health Strategies, it was felt that because the terms eradication and elimination were interchangeable in many languages, the use of elimination itself should be eliminated, and subsequently, these categorizations were discontinued. What is a Viral Mutation? How to Define Eradication? It is not easy to conceptualize eradication. If a definition of eradication were to include the term extinction, such a definition would prove problematic because both smallpox and rinderpest would not be considered eradicated. This is because samples of both viruses still exist. Stocks of VARV are to be found in the USA and Russia; meanwhile, there are samples of RPV in many facilities across the globe (Corona, 2020). Another way to define eradication that the WHO and various other organizations have accepted is the “permanent reduction to zero of the worldwide incidences of infection caused by a specific agent as a result of deliberate efforts.” The definition better supports the cases of VARV and RPV, whereby the incidence of the former has not been seen since 1977 in Somalia and the latter since 2001 in Kenya (Corona, 2020). The above definition is also rather narrow in scope; consequently, the WHO and other organizations have moved toward elimination rather than eradication. Here the incidence of disease does not need to be permanently reduced to zero globally for the definition to hold. Instead, a disease needs to be reduced to zero in a particular geographical locale.

There are two main types of influenza virus: A and B. Influenza A infects humans and animals such as aquatic birds. This type causes most seasonal flu cases and is responsible for initiating pandemics. Meanwhile, influenza B infects humans ––and for some reason, seals are also susceptible––but never causes pandemics. It was widely thought that influenza A strains were constantly evolving and thus outcompeting the human immune system. But scientific research has now revealed this not to be the case. In fact, it has now been discovered that influenza virus strains can go extinct. The strain that caused the 1918 influenza pandemic is no longer in existence. The one that led to the 1957 avian flu outbreak has also disappeared. Strains can abruptly go extinct after being replaced by viral strains that have evolved in nature. There has been a significant worldwide reduction in influenza cases during the COVID-19 pandemic. This has involved both the A and B types. Influenza B (IBV) accounts for approximately one-quarter of cases, and yet the B/Yamagata lineage was not isolated during the period April 2020 to August 2021, and it has been postulated that the global prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 has precipitated the extinction of this lineage (Koutsakos, 2021). Are There Measures in Place to Tackle Eradication? The One Health initiative coordinated by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) aims to tackle disease prevention, treatment, and eradication by integrating human health, animal health, and environmental factors. One Health considers the spread of disease concerning the following factors: climate change, global human migration into previously unpopulated areas, increased human-animal interaction, and human and animal migration per se.

Simply put it is not about eradicating a virus such as covid but rather learning how to live with it much like we learn how to live with colds, flu etc. Unfortunately western medicine is always looking for the quick fix as in products from the pharmaceutical industry.There are many health practices/sciences developed throughout the world that western medical authorities choose to ignore. They work. Many recognized doctors & researchers within our western medical community have successfully treated patients with covid at significant cost to them from the medical authorities. Dr. Nicola Williams is a researcher - Do aspects of her research cause her to question conventional thinking in the practice of medicine? Hopefully it would but would it ever get enough traction on the ground to actually benefit people. A lot of time and money is expended on research however I tend to think the beneficiaries are mostly the people it employs, the prestige of researchers & related institutions and corporations. That's the world we live in and rather than eradicating the corrupted system, I live with it the best I can. 0 0 Reply The opinions expressed here are the views of the writer and do not necessarily reflect the views and opinions of News Medical.

Ninety-two seals were reported stranded in Maine from May 10 to July 4, and the rate of dead seals from strandings is three times what’s normally seen by this point in the year, per NOAA. "While marine mammal strandings frequently occur, there are some cases, such as this one, where an unusually high number of live or dead animals may come ashore in a short period of time in the same geographic area," says Ainsley Smith, regional marine mammal stranding coordinator with NOAA Fisheries, per Sean Stackhouse from News Center Maine. Samples from eight seals were sent to Tufts University for testing, and four tested positive for H5N1, the avian influenza currently circulating in wild and domestic birds. The flu has also infected foxes, bobcats, skunks, otters and other mammals, including two humans. “The seal is the first marine mammal that we’ve seen on the spillover end,” Dr. Julianna Lenoch, a national wildlife disease program coordinator for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, said at a news briefing on Wednesday, per the New York Times’ Emily Anthes. “But this is not unexpected to have bird flu move into mammalian species on occasion.”USDA has confirmed recent seal deaths in ME linked to Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza. For info: https:/.co/h6F8gd0mNBIf you see a sick, injured, or dead seal, call the ME Marine Animal Reporting Hotline at 1-800-532-9551. pic.twitter.com/KwEsMMdVFK— NOAA Fisheries NE/MA (@NOAAFish_GARFO) July 3, 2022 Bird flus in the past have tended to die out in the summer and return in the fall, per the Times, but whether this strain will do the same is unknown. “This particular avian influenza is acting a little bit different, so we’re going to remain on high alert,” Lenoch tells the newspaper. Meanwhile, millions of birds in the U.S. have either died or been culled because of the disease. Zoos across the country have moved their birds indoors to prevent contact with wild birds. Seabird deaths in the U.K. have risen so high that several parks have closed to visitors . "This is substantially different than the outbreak we experienced in 2015, with more species, bigger numbers, more substantial mortality and this tremendously larger geographic footprint," Bryan Richards from the USGS National Wildlife Health Center tells Patty Wight of Maine Public. "So essentially, there's a lot more virus out there in the environment this time around." NOAA states that the risk to the general public remains low, but recommends both humans and pets stay at least 150 feet away from live and dead seals.

What's worse is that it's hard to tell the two infections apart, and the only way to differentiate them is through a medical test. The Malaysian Health Ministry said the positive rate for influenza-like illness was up 10.7 per cent in the week between July 3 and July 9, compared to 5.5 per cent in the previous week. Technical Committee chairman for the Immunise4Life Programme Professor Datuk Dr Zulkifli Ismail said dual infection of influenza and Covid-19, known as "flurona", was rare. "But it is possible to get multiple infections," he said. Dr Zulkifli said those who were over 65 years old, pregnant women, children under the age five and those with comorbidity were the vulnerable groups for influenza. "It is almost the same as the risk of Covid-19," he said. Universiti Putra Malaysia dean of the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Professor Dr Zamberi Sekawi, said the overlap of symptoms could be tricky, given the similarities between the two. "The symptoms can overlap, but if we talk about influenza, the patient normally has a high fever, cough, lethargy, and joint pain," he said. "These last for about one week." Severe influenza among the vulnerable groups could turn fatal, he added. "Actually, the risk of death more than doubles when someone is infected by both the flu and Covid-19 viruses," he said, adding that the risk and severity also depended on the immunity of the patient. Influenza is usually treated with anti-viral drugs. "We have anti-viral drugs to be given to patients, but it has to be given as early as possible," said Dr Zamberi. "It works within 24 to 48 hours. That would alleviate the symptoms and prevent complications." More On This Topic Peru reports first death from flurona - an infection of both the flu and Covid-19 Covid-flu joint booster jab possible late 2023: Moderna Dr Koh Kar Chai, president of the Malaysian Medical Association, said that with the Omicron variant of Covid-19 spreading, it was difficult to distinguish its symptoms from influenza. "We will need to rely on tests to identify the infection," he said. "There are rapid swab tests for both the diseases that can be done at a clinic for a diagnosis to be made." Dr Koh added that co-infection of Covid-19 and influenza could cause complications in diagnosis, treatment and recovery. "It can be fatal for those with debilitating comorbidity," he added. Medical Practitioners Coalition Association of Malaysia president Dr Raj Kumar Maharajah said the standard operating procedure associated with Covid-19 applied to influenza. "The precautions for all three - influenza, the normal flu and Covid-19 - are the same. "Wear a mask, practise physical distancing, personal hygiene and avoid crowded places. "If you are sick, stay home; don't go to work," he said.

Those measures include not touching dead birds, keeping dogs on a leash and away from bird carcasses, and disinfecting shoes and boots before and after going to parks or the beach if you have poultry or backyard flocks at home.“You can’t keep birds from congregating,” said John Herbert, a biologist with the state Department of Environmental Management. “That’s part of their natural biology and behavior. But we can help limit the spread. We want to make sure the public understands the risk is not to human health, but if they do have chickens or ducks at their house, they should be aware of this.”Get Rhode Island News AlertsSign up to get breaking news and interesting stories from Rhode Island in your inbox each weekday.Enter EmailSign UpAccording to the DEM, a strain of H5N1 bird flu first emerged in Europe and Central Asia in 2020. It reached North America in December 2021.AdvertisementThe great black-backed gull in South Kingstown, which was found on June 23, is the first confirmed case in Rhode Island, either in wild or domestic birds. A sample had been sent to a U.S. Geological Survey site in Wisconsin to confirm it.In March, officials warned that bird flu had been detected in multiple parts of Massachusetts. The virus has become more of a concern recently amid an increase in reports of dead and dying seabirds, and officials suspect that highly pathogenic avian influenza is to blame. Hundreds of dead birds have recently been found on Martha’s Vineyard, for example.In the past six weeks, multiple locations along the Atlantic Coast, including Rhode Island, have seen higher than usual numbers of dead water birds like cormorants, gulls, shearwaters and terns. RI DEM’s Division of Fish and Wildlife has a count of 40 dead water birds reported this summer.AdvertisementThat does not include a recent large-scale mortality event of shearwaters, which is now thought to be unrelated to bird flu, RI DEM says. It might have been starvation-related, Herbert said Wednesday.The last U.S. outbreak of a highly pathogenic — in other words, more severe and deadly — avian influenza was in 2017, RI DEM says. The disease has hit nesting shorebirds in Europe particularly hard.Officials in Rhode Island and Massachusetts are asking the public to report sightings of sick or dead seabirds, or five or more sick or dead wild birds of another species at a single location. Signs of infection can include imbalance, inability to fly and breathing distress. In Rhode Island, report dead bird sightings to RI DEM online. In Massachusetts submit observations online at mass.goveportbirds.Brian Amaral can be reached at brian.amaral@globe.com.

Matthias Bein / picture alliance via Getty Images The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted emergency authorization to Novavax’s Covid-19 vaccine, providing a more traditional protein-based alternative to the three mRNA-based vaccines now available. The authorization covers only the initial two shots; the vaccine is not yet approved for boosters or for use in children, per the Washington Post’s Carolyn Y. Johnson. Currently, about a third of Americans—or 100 million individuals—are unvaccinated. “Having a protein-based alternative may be more comfortable for some in terms of their acceptance of vaccine,” said Peter Marks, the FDA’s director of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, during a meeting of the agency’s independent expert committee, per The Verge’s Nicole Wetsman The Novavax vaccine works similar to how vaccines against shingles and influenza work, reports the Post. It delivers coronavirus spike protein cells to the body, which invokes an immune response. It also contains an adjuvant, which boosts the immune response to the vaccine, per a statement from the FDA. "Protein-based vaccines like this have quite a long history—from hepatitis to meningococcal B, to HPV," Novavax's chief medical officer Filip Dubovsky told BBC News in April. "I think some people are reassured by the decades of safety profiles which are based on this technology." The shots were tested in a trial in the United States and Mexico. Almost 20,000 participants received the vaccine and about 10,000 got a placebo. Over a period of three months, 14 cases of Covid-19 were noted among vaccine recipients and 63 among those who got the placebo, representing a 90.4 percent efficacy. But the vaccine was tested before both the Delta and Omicron variants were circulating widely, per The Verge, so the efficacy is expected to decrease. “The Novavax data was pretty significant,” Wayne A. Marasco, an FDA adviser and professor of cancer immunology and virology at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, tells the Post. “I wonder if we’re not witnessing some of the limitation that there may be [of] the mRNA vaccines. Yes, they were first out of the gate. But they don’t appear to have that breadth of protection.” The protein-based vaccine was initially regarded as a Covid-19 vaccine front-runner, and received funding from the federal government during Operation Warp Speed. But manufacturing problems delayed testing of the shots, and even after the vaccine was shown effective in trials, manufacturing issues held up submission to the FDA for approval, per The Verge. In June, FDA advisors recommended the vaccine for emergency use in adults. Despite enthusiasm from some, health professionals aren't sure whether the new approval will spur vaccine skeptics to get their shots. A recent Morning Consult poll found that 77 percent of unvaccinated adults said they wouldn’t get a traditional protein-based COVID-19 shot if one were available. “Optimism that the Novavax vaccine will have a significant impact on the number of unvaccinated Americans is misplaced,” Jason Schwartz, an associate professor at the Yale School of Public Health, tells STAT’s Matthew Herper. “A small number of people might have been waiting for a vaccine that doesn’t involve mRNA technology or lacks the remote links to fetal tissue associated with the development of the currently available vaccines, but the vast majority of those unvaccinated have made their choice for unrelated and deeply ingrained reasons.” The shots will need approval from the CDC before they can be administered, but the Biden administration has already announced it would buy 3.2 million doses.

Waterfowl Importation Ban Could Cause Confusion for Hunters at Canadian Border American hunters attempting to re-enter the U.S. with harvested waterfowl will have to deal with additional regulations due to avian flu By Joe Genzel Posted on Jul 11, 2022 6:20 PM EDT Snow geese are often the most susceptible waterfowl species to contract bird flu because they roost and fly in such large numbers. Steve Hillebrand / USFWS Share In late June 2022, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) issued a ban on the importation of live birds, eggs, and raw wild waterfowl meat from Canada into the U.S. The ban was a response to a strain of avian influenza, known as HPAI, infecting domestic and wild birds across North America (it has been detected in more than 40 states and 10 provinces throughout the U.S., Canada, and Mexico this year). To slow the spread, APHIS is requiring U.S. hunters to cook any bird meat they intend to bring across the Canadian-U.S. border. This rule has been in place for U.S. hunters returning from Mexico for years. Also, hunters wishing to mount trophy birds from Mexico must employ a USDA-licensed taxidermist so that the meat can be disposed of and the bird properly sterilized before it is returned to the hunter. U.S. hunters returning with taxidermy birds from Canada this fall will face the same requirements if the importation ban remains in place. “Unprocessed avian products and byproducts originating from or transiting a restricted zone will not be permitted to enter the United States, including hunter-harvested meat,” APHIS said in a statement. “Non-fully finished avian hunting trophies must be consigned to an APHIS-approved taxidermy establishment.” The importation ban only pertains to birds that fly through or are killed within the boundaries of specified control zones. These are areas that have a high incidence of bird flu. There is a continually updated map of the control zones within Canadian provinces to show hunters where these hot spots are located. Of course, the zones often change since waterfowl are migratory, which could make it difficult for hunters to judge if the birds they have killed are inside the parameters of the affected zones. And it will be virtually impossible for them to know if those birds flew through a control zone. “I honestly think it’s pretty silly,” said Ryan Bassham, who has hunted Canada and Mexico extensively and helps hunters book bucket-list trips across the globe through his agency, Trophy Expeditions. “We know that waterfowl breed in the Prairie Pothole Region, lay their eggs, and then migrate south. They fly from Canada to the U.S. and some move on to Mexico. So, why is regulating the meat from waterfowl [necessary], when birds are already flying across the border?” How to Cross the Border Legally with Harvested Waterfowl The USDA has mandated hunters cook any waterfowl that is shot in a control zone if they intended to bring bird meat across the border from Canada. Joe Genzel Migratory bird law is confounding enough, but APHIS is adding another layer of confusion for hunters by telling them that if they cook their bird meat from a duck or goose that was killed inside a Canadian control zone, they are safe to cross back into the U.S. However, U.S. Fish and Wildlife (USFWS) requires that hunters leave a wing on all harvested waterfowl so that birds can be identified at the border. This is also a requirement when transporting any unprocessed waterfowl in the U.S. It’s possible that a hunter could interpret the APHIS requirement of cooking waterfowl meat before crossing the border as a legal means to re-enter the U.S. with their harvest. But that’s not exactly true. What APHIS doesn’t make clear—and it’s possible they are unaware of—is that the wing still needs to be on the bird even if you cook it to comply with the USFWS regulations. That means you would need to cook the bird meat with the wing still on it. If you crossed into the U.S. with just the cooked meat and no wing, that’s against the law and violates tenants of the Lacey Act. “I worked for the Fish and Wildlife Service for 15 years, and I think what is happening is you have two federal agencies [the USFWS and USDA] not communicating with one another,” said Dr. Chris Nicolai, a biologist with Delta Waterfowl. “You’ve got the USDA that’s protecting agriculture. They’re used to livestock, dealing with eggs and chickens. Then you have the USFWS and they deal with bird identification and regulations. They don’t talk to each other ever. “In order to satisfy both agencies in this case, I would have to smoke a goose with the wing attached, which I think I could do, though I don’t think most people would [eat] it with me. But the problem is [the USDA and USFWS] have different requirements that overlap zero. To be legal for one, you’re illegal for the other. It’s like pick your poison.” Read Next: Wyoming Game and Fish Kills 1,200 Pheasants to Prevent an Avian Flu Outbreak How Will the Bird Importation Ban Be Enforced? Knowing whether or not you are shooting birds in a control zone could get tricky as birds migrate. Joe Genzel This isn’t the first time an import ban has impacted U.S. waterfowlers. In 2005 there was a global spread of H5N1 bird flu. When duck season opened in Canada that fall the ban on transporting infected birds into the U.S. remained in place. Though it didn’t last the entire season, scores of dead birds determined to have been shot in control zones had to be thrown away by hunters trying to re-enter the U.S. “In 2005 I had a buddy from Alaska come with me to Canada on trip we had been planning for years,” Nicolai said. “We weren’t able to change our dates and just decided to go and deal with it as we were up there. When we went into Canada there were lines of dumpsters on the Canadian side full of birds. We saw people throwing birds in these dumpsters. There were rumors that some [U.S. politicians] saw this and got the whole thing shut down. By the time we crossed back into the U.S. we were able to bring all our birds back like normal.” Maybe the most perplexing component of the restrictions is that they require hunters to know the exact location of where birds were harvested or what region they flew through before they were harvested. With control zones changing rapidly, it could be difficult to ascertain if birds were killed in an HPAI hot spot or not, especially if you are a U.S. hunter new to hunting in Canada. And it’s next to impossible to know if a bird flew through one of these zones unless it has a GPS affixed to it, which very few do. Moreover, there are no known studies that show import/export regulations stop the spread of avian influenza, according to a leading biologist of wildlife health and disease at the U.S. Geological Survey, the agency tasked with banding and collecting data on the movements of wild waterfowl. “CBP officers are well-trained and highly skilled at processing travelers at the border,” U.S. Customs and Border Protection said in an emailed statement to Outdoor Life. “During the inspection process, if the CBP officer determines hunters are traveling with gamebirds harvested within the restricted areas, the hunter will be prohibited from bringing the birds into the United States. To help avoid possible penalties, travelers must declare all items obtained while outside the U.S.” But in all reality, there’s no way for a customs agent to determine if a hunter was hunting in a control zone unless the hunter offers that information. It’s also possible that U.S. hunters may be ignorant of the import ban or the exact locations they were hunting, making it a real possibility for them to either show up at the border with infected raw meat which must be thrown out or cross the border illegally if they have unknowingly harvested birds from a control zone. “Most of our clients are OK with eating what they can while they stay with us, and then we have the rest of the meat processed and donated to local farmers,” said Shelby Kirby, an outfitter who owns Black Sheep Waterfowl in Saskatchewan with her husband, Chris. “I wish there was a better alternative. It’s 2022 where technology is everywhere. Allow U.S. hunters to have their meat processed here and shipped back by a professional processor. I think that would be a simple solution to this ‘problem.’” Duck Hunting Goose Hunting Hunting Waterfowl Hunting Summary U.S. hunters headed to Canada will need to take added precautions this fall if an importation ban imposed by the USDA remains in place.

Makenzie Rankin, Staff Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save Adventist Health Hospital has seen an uptick in influenza and COVID-19 cases in the emergency department, as summertime brings people together."In the last two months there has been an increase of about 30% in patient volume with cases of influenza and COVID-19," said Magan Storm, a doctor at the hospital since 2019. "Summer heat has also increased cases of heat stroke and severe sun burns." Storm said that with the end of mandated masks in most places, and summer being a time for gatherings, the emergency room is a busier place."The summer heat is really good for the virus. We have seen multiple cases of a patient with both COVID-19 and influenza in the recent months," Storm said.Storm noted deep concern about the number of unvaccinated people in the region."With COVID-19 we have seen the sickest patients are the un-vaccinated. Vaccinated individuals still can get sick, but they aren't as likely to develop severe cases as their un-vaccinated counterparts," she said.With the increase in cases, the hospital has created visitation guidelines for admitted patients. Visitors must be vaccinated or show a 72-hour negative COVID-19 test to visit a patient. The emergency department allows one visitor per patient and all visitors and patients must wear a surgical mask while inside the building, according to officials."In the beginning, COVID was, and still is, more dangerous for the un-vaccinated population," Storm said. "We saw a lot of very sick patients, whether they were young or older didn't seem to matter. It was a very scary time for everyone."She continued, "As more information was given to medical providers we tried to continue to provide the best care for our patients. As the strains kept changing, we saw some asymptomatic patients. They would be sick with COVID-19 and not know, then go about their day-to-day lives."There is still a lot of COVID out there. It is starting to become endemic, so that means it isn't just going to go away."Storm noted that flu and COVID-19 symptoms are similar in many regards, and said the hospital has a test that identifies both that is given to anybody who is admitted.According to Storm, patients are treated using a triage system, identifying the sickest patient first and working from there to create a priority."When a patient comes into the ED, we try to have them triaged within the first 10 minutes. This helps us to determine what time limit their complaint has," Storm said.

Early detection of flu can improve treatment to prevent significant illness, particularly in the young, elderly and immunocompromised.A simple RAT test, the same as the ones we've become accustomed to using for COVID, could potentially help in detecting the virus early and stopping the spread of flu.How do flu RATs work?RATs are short for rapid antigen tests and they can quickly test whether a person has Influenza A or B — two of the most common strains of flu virus.The test is designed to pick up the presence of specific antigens of the flu virus, which when detected produce a coloured band to indicate a positive test result, similar to the line you've seen on your COVID RATs.At the moment, RAT tests for flu are not widely available, are expensive compared to the COVID tests, and most suffer problems with sensitivity and/or specificity (their ability to detect positive cases) that need further work and testing. However, this could change if there was more demand for flu RATs.Antivirals reduce the risk of hospitalisation in flu patients. (ABC News: Kym Agius)Could flu RATs make a difference to rates of flu and illness?Influenza and COVID cause similar symptoms, however, the drugs we have to manage these diseases require a precise identification. This is critical, as it governs what type of antiviral drug is given.Current flu RATs are most sensitive up to four days after symptom onset. A positive detection during this period can facilitate a quicker treatment strategy with antivirals, as these drugs have a narrow window of therapeutic opportunity.Why Australia's COVID-19 and flu cases are risingPhoto shows Jacqui Driver caught COVID twice ABC News_Fletcher YeungThe message is clear: The COVID-19 pandemic isn't over, and Australians should brace themself for a winter of not just that virus, but other lurgies too.If a patient tests positive for flu, they can then receive Tamiflu, the antiviral recommended for flu cases, which reduces the risk of hospitalisation.However, this must be taken within two days of infection (when symptoms emerge) for it to be effective. Everyone can get Tamiflu but they require a prescription, which makes it difficult to get the drug within the two-day window needed to be effective.Tamiflu would not work against COVID, which requires a different antiviral for elderly and otherwise unwell patients, such as Paxlovid.A flu RAT would benefit people at risk of severe illness such as babies, young children, the elderly and the immunocompromised. This would increase the chance of early detection to enable treatment, and it could also give us more accurate figures of the number of people with flu each season.Flu RATs could also help in the management of outbreaks in high-risk communities such as aged care, nursing homes, schools and day care. A quick detection of flu could assist in measures to reduce the chances of transmission by antiviral treatment and isolation, as we've seen with COVID.Are flu RATs available in Australia?There are currently no flu RATs approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) in Australia for public use at home. The TGA has approved eight tests that are used only in a clinical setting, and these are designed to detect both flu and COVID.We need to lobby the government to action TGA approval of home flu RATs, as public demand will help drive this process. The TGA will require time and money to test and develop the RATs to a high standard.Therefore we can't expect Australian-based RATs for this flu season, but given we are now all so comfortable with at-home antigen testing, testing for flu is the logical next step.Stavros Selemidis is a Professor of Pharmacology at RMIT University, Doug Brooks is a Professor at the University of South Australia, and John O'Leary is a Chair Professor at Trinity College Dublin.

Pune city, this year, has reported only five positive cases for H1N1 influenza or swine flu with one death so far according to health department officials. (HT FILE PHOTO) Swine flu infection or H1N1 influenza is primarily found in pigs. The symptoms include fever, lethargy, sneezing, coughing, difficulty in breathing and a decreased appetite. This year a total of 6,350 cases have been screened for swine flu and tamiflu has been administered to 3,016 patients. Swab samples of 3,016 patients were sent for testing, out of which only five tested positive as per the health department of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC). Dr Sanjeev Wavare, PMC assistant health officer said that in 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic struck we could report only 10 cases in March. “After that the city did not report any cases of swine flu as the entire healthcare machinery was directed towards the Covid-19 management and surveillance. Last year we reported nearly 79 cases of swine flu in the city limit,” said Dr Wavare. He added that the health department has applied the same methods to identify and report swine flu cases as Covid cases. “Patients are screened for swine flu and suspected cases are sent for taking swab samples. We then test these swab samples. So far, we have sent 3,016 swab samples till July 11 and only five of them have tested positive for swine flu. One death has been reported in the city due to swine flu so far and the patient was from the city limits. The same efforts taken for Covid-19 can be applied to control swine flu as well and we are doing the same,” said Dr Wavare. Pune city reported a Swine flu outbreak in 2009 when a total of 144 deaths were reported in the city due to H1N1 influenza. India reported its first case of Swine flu on May 13, 2008. Most of the cases reported subsequently were travel related cases among those travelling to India from affected countries. Substantial cases were reported from Mumbai and Pune in Maharashtra and other parts of the country in 2008.

They will continue to spend a little more time in their own safe, secure setting."600 reports of sick or dead birds, says provinceSaskatchewan's Ministry of Environment confirmed that the reports of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) have dropped off considerably since May because of migration.Since the start of the outbreak, the Ministry of Environment has received 600 reports of sick or dead birds, with around 200 presumptive positive cases of HPAI awaiting confirmation, the ministry said in an email."The virus continues to circulate in wild bird populations in the province," said the ministry.The ministry said it continues to get sporadic reports of illness and mortality in different nesting waterbirds such as cormorants and gulls, as well as in raptors and scavenging birds such as magpies, ravens and crows. "It is still difficult to gauge if the level of mortality is large enough to impact wild bird populations."Snow geese have been hit by avian flu this year. (Maryse Zeidler/CBC)On June 14, Saskatchewan's chief veterinary officer withdrew an animal health control area order imposed on April 14 to limit the co-mingling of poultry and cut the risk of exposure.The order prohibited birds from entering shows, auctions or other events where they would be brought to multiple locations.The Canadian Food Inspection Agency and the Ministry of Agriculture will continue to monitor the situation, the province says on its website.Presumptive cases in mammals in SaskatchewanIn May, presumptive cases of avian flu were showing up in some species of mammals in Saskatchewan.Back then Trent Bollinger, a wildlife pathologist at the Western College of Veterinary Medicine in Saskatoon, said the transmission to mammals was not a surprise since cases have been showing up in the United States. Hundreds of snow geese expected to have been killed by avian flu in SaskatchewanAvian flu may be killing Quebec harbour seals, scientists sayOverall, there have been five presumptive cases of HPAI in red foxes and five cases in striped skunks in Saskatchewan, according to the Ministry of Environment.The animals were found dead or showing clinical signs — seizures and tremors — similar to those observed in wild birds affected with the virus, said the ministry.ABOUT THE AUTHORTheresa KliemJournalistTheresa Kliem is a journalist with CBC Saskatoon.

Share this article 14/07/2022 | 08:47 AM Vivienne Clarke The HSE’s chief clinical officer, Dr Colm Henry has said that health care systems across Europe are concerned at the higher than expected levels of influenza in Australia at present. Traditionally such conditions are replicated the following winter in the Northern Hemisphere. The hospital system in Ireland was already under pressure because of rising Covid-19 cases with conditions similar to a difficult winter, he told Newstalk Breakfast.Advertisement At present 24 of 27 European countries are experiencing a surge in cases, he added. Dr Henry said that Covid “keeps coming up with surprises” and echoed a warning from the World Health Organisation that Covid-19 was not gone and continued to have an impact. 'Very worrying' It was “very worrying” that the Irish hospital system was under pressure from the current wave of the virus. While there had been high levels of vaccination initially (96 per cent), only 58 per cent of those eligible for the second booster had received it and if enough people in the community contracted the virus and got sick then more would need hospitalisation, he warned.Advertisement Of the people in hospital with Covid at present, half were sick with Covid, and half had tested positive for Covid while being treated for another ailment. Dr Henry pointed out that of the older people in hospital with Covid, half had not been boosted. One third had never been vaccinated. This was disproportionate, he said. “That’s where the virus can do harm”. The booster “does what it says on the box, it boosts”, he added. The European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) had recommended that the focus should be on older and vulnerable people and those with compromised immune systems. That was also the priority for Niac. Dr Henry urged the public to continue to wear masks on public transport, as this would help stop spread of the virus.

Swine flu infection or H1N1 influenza is primarily found in pigs. The symptoms include fever, lethargy, sneezing, coughing, difficulty in breathing and a decreased appetite. The senior health officer said cases of influenza and other respiratory viruses, such as the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and H1N1 (swine flu) are now being seen more frequently. “We are seeing an upward trend in H1N1 cases, particularly in the last 15 days. The majority are mild symptomatic but don't not need hospital admissions. Daily at least one patient is testing positive,” said Dr Kishore Sathe, Specialist Emergency Medicine, P.D. Hinduja Hospital and Medical Research Centre. According to the BMC data, there were only two cases of H1N1 across the city in June, but now there are three cases reported in the first 10 days of July. Dr Manjusha Agarwal, senior consultant-internal medicine at Global Hospital, Parel said, since the last few weeks they are seeing many patients with symptoms of high-grade fever, sore throat, cough and cold. Mostly these patients when tested for Covid turned out to be negative. Some of these patients when tested for Swine Flu have tested positive. Many patients do not want to undergo testing for swine flu due to cost factors and are prefering empirical treatment. The majority of patients got better immediately when appropriate antiviral therapy was given.

We have not seen any complications of swine flu-like ARDS which was a dreaded complication during the 2010-12 wave. Vaccination of all elderly people beyond 65 years of age with comorbidities, younger susceptible populations with influenza vaccination is imperative,” she said. Senior doctors from the civic-run hospital said, "they have come across many cases who are down with these symptoms and most of them are testing positive for influenza A." While last year there were hardly any cases of swine flu or influenza, city doctors say this year apart from the rise, they are also seeing a high rate of infection.“In the past one month, we have seen 7 to 8 cases and most of them have symptoms similar to COVID-19 like fever, cough, sore throat. If I test 10 people with these symptoms, the majority are turning positive for influenza and Swine Flu,” said a doctor from the KEM hospital. With swine flu tests costing around Rs 4000, doctors said diagnosis is based on clinical parameters and not on lab testing. "We tend to treat them based on clinical presentation and they are responding to the treatment. Swine flu tests are costly.
