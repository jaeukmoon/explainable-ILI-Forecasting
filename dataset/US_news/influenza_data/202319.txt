The compound targets the host RNA methyltransferase MTr1, and thus prevents viral “cap snatching” (Fig. 1). These results may help to develop novel drugs that target viral host dependency factors and are thus less likely to induce viral resistance.Fig. 1The MTr1 inhibitor TFTM prevents IAV and IBV cap-snatching and thus restricts viral replication. Host 5’cap0-mRNAs are matured to cap1 mRNAs by the cellular Cap-specific mRNA (nucleoside-2’-O-)-methyltransferase 1 (MTr1). The IAV/IBV viral polymerase complex PB2/PA/PB1 selectively recognizes MTr1 modified cap1 structures, cleaves them off the cellular mRNA and uses them as primers for the synthesis of viral mRNAs (“cap-snatching”). The camouflaged viral mRNAs are then readily translated into viral proteins to eventually promote viral progeny. Trifluoromethy-tubericin (TFMT) inhibits MTr1 and thus prevents cap-snatching by IAV and IBV and inhibits viral replicationFull size imageInfluenza remains a global health threat affecting millions of people and causing hundreds of thousands of deaths each year. Despite ongoing surveillance, it is impossible to predict which zoonotic virus strains may emerge and vaccine efficiency in preventing illness is typically just ~40–60%. Drugs targeting the viral neuraminidase (NA) or ion channel (M2) have been approved for clinical use.2 However, influenza viruses evolve rapidly (anti-genic drift)2 and many circulating strains of IAV and IBV are resistant against existing therapeutic agents. Therefore, there is a dire need for novel therapeutic strategies against influenza. In addition, coinfection of birds, pigs or humans infected with different IAV strains may result in gene reassortments (anti-genic shift) leading to the emergence of novel viral strains that are resistant to existing prophylactic and therapeutic measures. Although antigenic shift is rare, its impact can be devastating as seen in the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic. Importantly, therapeutics targeting cellular factors critical for viral replication are less prone to viral resistance.3Cellular mRNAs are initially 5’terminally capped by 7-methylguanosine or 2,2,7-trimethyl-guanosine (cap0) and subsequently methylated at the first nucleotide by the cellular host 2′-O-ribose methyltransferase 1 (MTr1) resulting in the mature cap1 structure. This ensures recognition by the ribosome, stabilizes the mRNA, and prevents recognition by innate immune sensors. Successful viruses mimic the mature cap1 structure on their viral mRNAs to avoid immune activation and ensure efficient replication. Some viruses encode their own methyltransferases to modify the 5’cap. In contrast, Bunya- and Orthomyxoviruses including influenza viruses “steal” the mature cap1 structure from host cell mRNAs (Fig. 1).4 During “cap snatching” the viral polymerase containing PB1, PB2 and PA cleaves mature cellular mRNAs downstream of the 5’cap1 structure and uses the snatched 5’cap1 RNA as a primer for the nascent viral mRNA. Of note, the PB2 subunit of the IAV polymerase has previously been recognized as a promising drug target.5 However, no inhibitors of the cellular MTr1 enzyme have been reported.To evaluate whether MTr1 can be exploited in host-targeting anti-influenza approaches, Tsukamoto and colleagues first generated cell lines lacking MTr1 expression.1 In these cells, replication of IAV and IBV was strongly attenuated and rescued by ectopically expressing functional but not catalytically inactive MTr1. Notably, only viral mRNA but not cellular mRNA expression was impaired. MTr1 KO restricted various IAV and IBV strains but had little if any effect on other cap-snatching viruses, like Influenza D viruses or Bunyaviridae. After an in silico screen of 5597 compounds and molecular docking studies using the MTr1 crystal structure (PDB ID: 4N49) they identified tubercidin, a naturally occurring adenosine analog from Streptomyces, as a putative binding partner. In vitro experiments confirmed that tubercidin inhibits MTr1 through interaction with its S-adenosyl-L-methionine binding pocket. Since tubercidin is cytotoxic, the authors performed an elegant series of experiments using more than 100 tubercidin-related compounds to identify trifluoromethyl-tubercidin (TFMT) as an effective antiviral agent that targets MTr1 with no apparent in vitro toxicity.The authors show that TFMT inhibits replication of different IAV and IBV strains, including seasonal strains, in primary human bronchial lung cells in vitro and protects human lung explants ex vivo against infection and virus-induced pathology. Although TFMT was less effective in a mouse cell line compared to human cells (IC50 7.7 µM vs 0.3 µM) it still prevented IAV infection induced weight loss in mice and reduced the levels of viral replication in vivo.MTr1 inhibition by TFMT treatment may increase the levels of immature cap0 RNAs known to be sensed by RIG-I to induce antiviral IFN responses. Thus, TFMT treatment may inhibit influenza viruses by inducing innate antiviral factors. However, in a series of experiments involving pharmacological inhibition of innate immune signaling and genetic KO of sensors, Tsukamoto and colleagues demonstrated that TFMT inhibits viral replication directly by affecting its cap-snatching activity and not through immune modulation. Using structural modelling, they show that the absence of the additional methyl group in cap1 attached by MTr1 would prevent binding to PB2. Of note, depletion of alternative methyltransferases does not affect IAV or IBV replication. Thus, cap-snatching of IAV and IBV specifically requires MTr1-modified caps but not caps processed by other methyltransferases. TFMT acts synergistically with approved anti-influenza drugs and remained active against a baloxavir marboxil-resistant IAV mutant.Several cap-snatching viruses do not require MTr1 and are baloxavir- and marboxil-resistant raising the possibility that IAV and IBV may also be able to develop resistance to TFMT. However, mutant IAV constructs containing various changes in the cap-binding site of PB2 generally required MTr1 for replication. Thus, determinants of cap-snatching seem conserved, suggesting resistance against MTr1 inhibitors development may be difficult. However, given the versatility of IAV and IBV and alternative cap-snatching mechanisms in closely related viruses like influenza D virus future development of resistance cannot be excluded.This study of Tsukamoto and colleagues impressively demonstrates how basic research of viral properties may be translated to anti-viral drug development. While the results of the study are promising, some limitations are noteworthy. The IC50 of TFMT is relatively high and MTr1 plays an important role in cellular mRNA maturation and avoiding immune detection. The mice analyzed in this study received the first dose of TFMT within an hour after virus exposure and were only treated over two days. Thus, it remains unclear if TFMT treatment may induce inflammatory responses and affect cellular protein synthesis during longer durations of human flu treatment. Finally, it will also be important to explore the effects of TFMT under more realistic conditions, as flu patients typically begin treatment after symptom onset. ReferencesTsukamoto, Y. et al.

The risk to the general public in Europe remains low. These are the main findings from the latest report on avian influenza by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), and the EU reference laboratory (EURL). Poultry outbreaks occurred less frequently in March and April compared to the previous reporting period (3 December 2022 to 1 March 2023) and compared to spring 2022. The detection of cases in wild birds in March and April decreased compared to the previous reporting period but increased compared to spring 2022. The virus showed signs of being well adapted to wild birds, heavily affecting black-headed gulls and increasing the mortality of threatened wild species A subdivision of the genus, a species is a group of closely related and similar-looking organisms; for example, in the case of Homo sapiens (humans), the second part of the name (sapiens) represents the species such as the peregrine falcon.HPAI continued to expand in the Americas and is expected to reach the Antarctic in the near future. Infections were detected in six new mammal species for the first time, including marine mammals and mustelids. Two cases were reported in cats in the USA and one case in a dog in Canada. As a precautionary measure, EFSA recommends preventing pets from being exposed to dead or diseased animals in areas affected by HPAI.Low risk to the general populationThe risk to the general public in Europe remains low, and low to moderate for workers and other people in contact with potentially infected diseased and dead birds and mammals.Links to scienceAvian influenza overview March – April 2023How to contact usEFSA Media Relations OfficeTel. +39 0521 036 149E-mail: press [at] efsa.europa.eu (Press[at]efsa[dot]europa[dot]eu)(Only if you are a member of the press)Ask a Question ServiceYou have a question about EFSA’s work?

The findings published in the journal Small describe a promising influenza vaccine candidate that uses adjuvants, substances that increase immune response to a vaccine, to boost effectiveness against viral infections. The researchers developed a novel type of core/shell protein nanoparticle consisting of influenza nucleoprotein as the core and NA1-M2e or NA2-M2e surface proteins as the coating antigens. In the new nanoparticle fabrication, the surface protein coating can be precisely controlled and any excessive coating proteins can be recovered for reuse. Thus, nanoparticle quality and yield are improved significantly. Mice were intramuscularly or intranasally vaccinated with the resulting protein nanoparticles with and without immune-stimulating complexes as adjuvants to determine the immune response and protective efficiency against influenza viral infections. “We found that the novel protein nanoparticles combined with the adjuvants could induce significantly improved mucosal immune responses and the accumulation of lung resident memory cells in the local respiratory tracts, providing complete protection against influenza viral infections,” said Dr. Wandi Zhu, first author of the study and a research assistant professor in the Institute for Biomedical Sciences at Georgia State. Influenza A virus is one of the most threatening respiratory pathogens and can cause severe morbidity, mortality and heavy economic burdens, especially in flu epidemics or pandemics. While vaccination is effective in preventing or reducing viral infections during annual flu seasons, the selection of vaccine strains depends on circulating viral surveillance and prediction. Mismatched strains could significantly impair vaccine efficiency. Also, the production of the current quadrivalent influenza vaccine is time-consuming. New vaccine technologies are needed to easily manufacture a universal influenza vaccine. The researchers have focused their work on developing different types of protein nanoparticle vaccines against both influenza A and influenza B viral infections. “The epidemics caused by the influenza virus seriously threaten public health and the economy,” said Dr. Baozhong Wang, senior author of the study and Distinguished University Professor in the Institute for Biomedical Sciences at Georgia State. “Adding appropriate adjuvants to improve immunogenicity and finding effective mucosal vaccines to combat respiratory infection at the portal of virus entry are important strategies to boost protection.” Adjuvanted protein nanoparticles could improve strong systemic and mucosal immune responses conferring protection in different immunization routes. This work highlights the importance of applying adjuvants in mucosal vaccine formulations. The adjuvanted protein nanoparticles can be used as mucosal vaccines alone or in combination with other vaccines to improve mucosal immunity and protection in the future, Zhu explained. “The new surface protein coating is a more controlled and efficient fabrication method than our previous process, significantly increasing the utilization of the initial proteins,” Zhu said. “The technique could be used to develop universal influenza vaccines consisting of influenza antigens from influenza A and influenza B viruses. The combination of the vaccine with appropriate adjuvants will be promising mucosal vaccine candidates.” Additional authors of the study were Lai Wei, Chunhong Dong, Joo Kim and Yao Ma of the Institute for Biomedical Sciences at Georgia State; and Jaeyoung Park, Thomas Pho and Julie A.

California Condor in the Northern Arizona and Southern Utah project area. Photo: Jim Shane By Zoe Grueskin Associate Editor, Audubon magazine Published May 10, 2023 In early 2022, when a new avian flu began circulating among North America’s wild birds in addition to domestic fowl, Tim Hauck took note. Hauck helps manage the reintroduction of California Condors in Arizona and Utah, a decades-long project to restore the iconic birds to an equally iconic landscape from the Grand Canyon to Zion National Park. Hauck and his team at The Peregrine Fund, a conservation organization focused on birds of prey, hoped that geography and the flock’s isolation would keep the birds safe from the virus. “We all suspected if it was going to hit anywhere, it was going to hit in California,” Hauck says. Waterfowl have proven to be particularly susceptible to the current avian flu, a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) identified as H5N1, and the flyways that they use while migrating pass mainly through California and along the coast. Carrion-eating condors could easily contract the disease by eating an infected bird, but the Arizona-Utah condors, also known as the southwest flock, live well outside the main path of the Pacific flyway. The flock’s location also means it never encounters condors from the four other re-established flocks in North America. But on March 9, Hauck and his team noticed a condor acting strangely when it arrived at the site where the team regularly puts out water and food for the birds. “It sat there," Hauck says. And sat there. At first, they suspected lead poisoning—a leading cause of death for wild condors, as well as Bald Eagles and Golden Eagles, of which lethargy is a tell-tale sign. But when the team was able to capture the bird, the lead test was negative. Still, they sent the ailing condor, a four-year old female, to a rehabilitation center in Phoenix for testing and care. What followed was a harrowing month. “Our crews have been absolutely entrenched in battle, picking up dead birds every day,” Hauck says. Not long after they noticed the lethargic bird, the team found a dead condor and confirmed the first case of HPAI. By mid-April, 20 birds had died, most of which tested positive for avian flu—a loss of 1 out of every 6 birds in the flock. “I don't think there's any doubt that this sets us back a significant amount of time,” Hauck says. “To lose 20 birds in a pretty short window, that's a decade plus of work right there.” California Condors are the largest flying birds in North America, with a wingspan of nine and a half feet. A species of vulture, condors take six to eight years to reach breeding age. Spring is typically an exciting season, Hauck says, as his team watches closely to see which birds will pair together, laying eggs between February and April. Before the arrival of HPAI, the team was also preparing to release three more condors into the southwest flock, which numbered 116 at the end of 2022, just shy of the recovery goals set decades earlier. From a precarious low of just 23 condors left in the world in 1984 to a population today that tops 500, Hauck calls the restoration of the California Condor “one of the greatest success stories in conservation.” Their recovery depended on a highly managed captive-breeding program and collaboration between dozens of public and private partners, guided by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS). The southwest flock’s geographic isolation—which didn’t prevent HPAI from reaching the birds but did stop it from spreading directly to other condors—wasn’t an accident, explains Ashleigh Blackford, who coordinates the FWS condor recovery program and is helping flock managers and other partners monitor and respond to the situation. “It’s actually part of the recovery strategy,” she says, and intended precisely for situations like this one; even if a catastrophic event strikes one population, other condor flocks won’t be affected. “HPAI is definitely showing why that was such foresight to have these separations," she says. "I’m thankful that they established that early in the program." That doesn’t mean the other flocks are free from danger. HPAI is still circulating in wild birds they could encounter, and if one condor gets sick, in-flock transmission remains a serious risk. Like other vultures, condors are particularly hardy birds, evolved to eat carrion that would sicken or kill many other species. So it’s somewhat surprising that HPAI has proved so deadly to them, Blackford says, but knowing they can get sick, the virus's quick spread makes sense—condors are extremely social. “They’re communal feeders," Blackford says. "They’re communal roosters.” Another risk factor, she points out, is that the birds "poop on themselves." It's an adaptation that helps them keep cool, but HPAI can spread through feces. Around the country, breeding programs and flock managers are taking extra precautions. In Arizona, Hauck and his crew started wearing additional protective gear that is used once and either washed or thrown away, and they stopped putting out food and water for the wild birds. “We did not want to congregate birds in a single location,” he says. That’s not an option for some flocks, like the newly established condors in northern California. Just last year, the Yurok Tribe released the first condors in the region since the 19th century. Chris West, who manages the flock, says the eight birds on the landscape still need direct support. In a long-standing population, the young learn first from their parents and then from other condors how to survive in their environment, but these birds don’t have that advantage. “We just released them into an area with no condors. So there's no one to teach them about the landscape and the resources,” he says. “They're having to learn everything themselves.” For that reason, West says they can’t stop providing food and water for the new and mentor-less birds, but they’ve intensified both their cleaning and monitoring. “We're not just watching the condors anymore,” he says. “We're watching all the Turkey Vultures. We're watching all the ravens,” ready to intervene if any bird shows signs of sickness. Extra precautions mean extra expenses. Blackford says FWS is exploring what, if any, additional funding could be available. In the meantime, partners including The Peregrine Fund and the Yurok Tribe are doing their own fundraising to support their efforts. Ultimately, HPAI circulating among wild birds may be something we can do little to curb. Blackford, Hauck, and West all stress that this fact makes it more important than ever to tackle the threats to condors we can address, namely poisoning from lead bullets that hunters leave behind in entrails and carcasses. “Let’s continue to collect our gut piles. Let’s continue to make transitions to non-lead ammunition,” Blackford says. “The more birds out there surviving on the landscapes will make us more resilient to these events that we don’t have as much control over.” In the southwest, the crisis seems to be ebbing as the days grow sunnier and warmer. No condors have been found sick or dead since April 11. Despite the loss of 13 birds of breeding age among the dead—the official death count was recently raised to 21 to include a “well-known and well-loved” adult who hasn’t been spotted since March—Hauck says a handful of nests are still on track to hatch very soon. Four condors taken for treatment at the Phoenix rehabilitators are recovering, including the very first bird the team noticed in distress in March. When she’s deemed healthy enough, and not at risk of infecting other birds, she’ll be returned to her flock, back to the canyons and the skies.

Before joining Vox, he was a senior energy reporter at Business Insider. Benji previously worked as a wildlife researcher.FacebookLinkIn the past two years, a viral disease has swept across much of the planet — not Covid but a type of avian flu. It’s devastated the poultry industry in the US, Europe, and elsewhere, sickening millions of farmed birds, which either die from infection or are killed by farmers seeking to stem the spread.The poultry outbreak has become an animal welfare crisis. It’s also one reason eggs have become so expensive; there are simply fewer hens to lay them.But the virus is causing another major crisis that’s drawn far less attention: the death of wild birds.The ongoing outbreak of avian flu has killed hundreds of thousands — if not millions — of wild birds, including endangered species like the California condor. It’s one of the worst wildlife disease outbreaks in history. Having now spread across five continents and hundreds of wildlife species, scientists call the current outbreak a panzootic, meaning a pandemic among animals.“What we’re seeing right now is uncharted territory,” said Andrew Ramey, a wildlife geneticist at the US Geological Survey, one of the federal agencies involved in testing wild birds for the virus.A flock of snow geese in flight at Bosque del Apache wildlife refuge in New Mexico. Thousands of snow geese have been affected by avian flu. Vicki Jauron/Getty ImagesThe number of dead birds in itself is historic, but so is the virus’s biology. Typically, avian influenza viruses only cause severe disease and death in domestic birds like chickens and farmed ducks; they sweep through populations, killing upward of 90 percent of the flock.This virus, however, is different. It’s hammering wild birds and other wildlife, including mammals.“It’s causing a high amount of mortality in a huge breadth of wild birds, which is not something that has been seen before,” said Wendy Puryear, a molecular virologist at Tufts University who studies viral evolution.This is especially concerning because birds are already at risk across the world. North America alone has lost an astonishing 3 billion breeding birds in the last half-century, due to threats like climate change, predation by feral and pet cats, and the loss of grasslands and other habitats. This panzootic is only making an ongoing extinction crisis worse.The virus could also pose a threat to us. While it doesn’t readily infect and spread among people today, the avian virus could evolve traits that make it more dangerous to humans as it circulates among wild animals. That’s another reason scientists are taking the outbreak among wild birds so seriously. An unusual avian fluViruses that cause avian flu are actually pretty common. They’ve been circulating for eons among wild birds — and especially waterfowl, such as ducks and geese — without causing them much harm. These mild forms of infection are called low-pathogenic avian influenza, or LPAI, which means they’re typically not deadly.On occasion, a low-pathogenic virus can jump from wild birds to poultry farms. As the virus replicates in densely packed warehouses of farmed birds, it can quickly evolve and pick up adaptations that make it highly deadly to poultry. At that point, it gets dubbed a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, or HPAI virus. Historically, however, most of these HPAI viruses haven’t killed large numbers of wild birds, even if they did spill out of the farm and back into wild populations.Then came an avian flu outbreak on a goose farm in China.A view from above of a farmer feeding more than 6,000 geese at a farm in Jiangsu province, China. Dense farms of waterfowl are especially susceptible to avian flu. Zhang Lianhua/VCG via Getty ImagesIn the spring of 1996, influenza caused by a virus known as H5N1 (named for the kinds of proteins found on its surface) spread among the geese. It was highly pathogenic and killed more than 40 percent of the farm birds it infected.Descendants of this virus have since triggered a new era for bird flu. They’re not only adapted to spread disease among poultry, but — and this is key — some varieties are also capable of spreading and causing severe disease among wild birds. That’s an important trait that separates this virus from past versions of avian flu.The US first experienced one of these goose farm viruses in 2014. After spreading to North America for the first time, the virus killed or affected tens of millions of poultry and an unknown number of wild birds, across at least 13 US states. At the time, officials were able to control the outbreak by slaughtering a huge number of farm birds.The situation today is more dire — and much harder to control.How bad is the current outbreak?The world now faces a more frightening version of this goose farm virus that appears better equipped to infect wild birds. First detected on North American soil in the winter of 2021, the virus, which is also a form of H5N1, has since spread throughout the US, into Mexico, and down through Central and South America. It’s infecting birds on every continent now other than Antarctica and Australia (where it almost certainly will arrive soon).The current outbreak has killed — or forced farmers to cull — more than half a billion poultry worldwide, a simply mind-boggling number of birds.It’s much harder to estimate the toll the virus has taken on wild birds.Two dead northern gannets in eastern Canada, on July 8, 2022. They likely died from avian flu. Lewnanny Richardson/iNaturalistIn the US, suspected or confirmed cases of H5N1 in wild birds are in the tens of thousands, according to a study published in April. Reporting by the Guardian revealed that the flu has killed more than 50,000 birds in the UK. In Eastern Canada alone, roughly 40,000 birds have been reported as sick or dead, likely linked to the flu, according to Stephanie Avery-Gomm, a research scientist with the Canadian government, who cited her preliminary, unpublished research.Yet most of these numbers are almost certainly underestimates. Government agencies don’t have the resources to test every dead bird. Plus, many individuals die out at sea, or in rural areas that lack any kind of surveillance.Testing in the US tends to focus only on a small number of avian species, or on birds that die en masse, according to Johanna Harvey, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Maryland who studies avian influenza. That leaves out smaller-scale outbreaks. Plus, global reporting of H5N1 cases in wild birds is often inconsistent or incomplete, according to a preprint paper published earlier this month.This suggests that “only a fraction of outbreaks in wildlife have been detected and appropriately reported,” scientists Marcel Klaassen and Michelle Wille wrote in the paper, which has yet to go through the formal peer review process.A map showing where the H5N1 virus, a highly pathogenic type of avian influenza, has been detected in poultry and wild birds, between December 2021 and March 2023. Johanna A. Harvey, et al./Biological ConservationSo how big is the number really? It’s likely in the millions globally, according to the paper by Klaassen and Wille. Scientists may never have an exact toll, but the spotty numbers they do have are ringing alarm bells.“We haven’t seen these kinds of numbers with an influenza outbreak in wild birds previously, ever,” said Puryear, of Tufts, who was not involved in that study.What avian flu means for biodiversityThe virus that’s killing birds today is highly “promiscuous,” Puryear said — meaning, it’s infecting and causing disease in all kinds of species. Scientists have found it in everything from vultures and bald eagles to American white pelicans and snowy owls.Birds that nest in colonies have been hit especially hard. These include things like snow geese, terns, and double-crested cormorants. According to Avery-Gomm, more than 20,000 of the potential cases of influenza in eastern Canada came from northern gannets — giant, colonial seabirds that spend most of their lives on the ocean.Scientists fear these die-offs could make a big dent in some avian populations, especially in ones that are already small.A pair of endangered California condors soar overhead in California. US Fish and Wildlife ServiceSince March, more than 20 California condors in the Southwest have died, and most of them tested positive for avian flu. The largest bird in North America, with a wingspan that can reach more than 9 feet, the California condor almost went extinct in the 1980s. A successful captive breeding program revived the population, which now stands at roughly 500 worldwide, though they’re still listed by the US government as endangered.Last summer, meanwhile, bird flu knocked out more than half of Lake Michigan’s population of Caspian terns, another threatened species.“Large die-offs can impact populations of these species for decades and may contribute to species collapse and further ecosystem damage, particularly given the critical declines seen in North American bird biodiversity over the last half century,” scientists wrote in the April study, which tallied reported and suspected cases of H5N1 in North American birds.Indeed, prior to the current outbreak, birds were already declining in nearly all habitats in the US, according to Cornell University’s State of the Birds report. Roughly half of all bird species are known (or likely) to be in decline globally.More troubling still is that avian influenza is also killing many mammals, including foxes, coyotes, mink, and seals. Earlier this year, officials reported that bird flu killed almost 3,500 seal lions in Peru. That’s worrying on a whole different level — because humans are mammals. Could this avian flu become a pandemic?The frightening link between infected wild birds and human healthNo, in its current form, avian influenza is not at all likely to cause a pandemic. While hundreds of humans have contracted H5N1 over the years — and many of them have died — those cases usually involve extremely high exposure to infected poultry. Biologically speaking, the virus isn’t well equipped to overtake our immune systems and spread quickly among human populations.The problem for us is that viruses, and especially influenza viruses, evolve quickly. Not only do they mutate, but they can also swap entire portions of their genomes with other viruses if they infect the same hosts. Under the right circumstances, this evolution could give them the tools to replicate more easily in mammals, which would make them more threatening to humans. (My colleague Keren Landman and I go into this in detail here.)The risk of the virus morphing into a human threat remain slim, yet the outbreak in wild birds may push it in that direction.During most past outbreaks, only poultry farms were badly infected, so countries could kill giant flocks of infected farm birds and exercise other biosecurity measures to stem the spread. That’s what happened during the outbreak in 2014 and 2015. In this case, however, wild birds are also a reservoir for highly pathogenic influenza. So no matter how much culling farmers do, wild birds could still pass H5N1 over to domestic populations.This is happening already: Most recent outbreaks on farms were started by wild birds, not farm-to-farm spread, Yuko Sato, a poultry veterinarian at Iowa State University, said in a briefing for reporters last month. Infected wild birds can spread the virus through their feces or breath when they flock to reservoirs near farms, or stop over while migrating. One reason wild birds are likely to enter farms in the first place is that so much of their natural habitat has been destroyed.“The challenge is that you can do all this work to make farms more secure, but that won’t matter if you have lots of infected wild birds,” said Nichola Hill, an infectious disease ecologist at the University of Massachusetts Boston.Once wild birds contaminate farms, the risks skyrocket. Viruses evolve much more quickly within animals that are packed tightly together, simply because they have more bodies to grow in. They’re also known to pick up adaptations that make them better equipped to replicate among mammals, Puryear said, though it’s not clear why.The other problem is that when flu viruses are widespread among wild birds, they have more opportunities to spill over directly into mammals. The virus has infected animals like foxes and seals that interact with birds. And as these microbes replicate within their cells, the flu viruses can pick up traits that make them more harmful to humans.This is not just theoretical. In a recent study, Puryear found that some H5N1 viruses that infected seals in New England had genetic changes that have been shown to make them more efficient at replicating within the cells of mammals. Researchers have found similar adaptations in H5N1 viruses found in foxes and mink. All of these animals likely got sick from wild birds.A harbor seal basking on the beach in Massachusetts’s Salisbury beach state park. Ken Canning/Getty ImagesA red fox with part of a chicken poking out of its mouth. Getty Images/iStockphotoThere is some reassuring news, however: Not only is the virus biologically ill-equipped to cause a pandemic, but the US government has also stockpiled vaccines, including those specifically for H5N1. (There are also vaccines for birds, which my colleague Kenny Torrella writes about here.)“It’s not Covid,” Puryear said, referencing how there were no coronavirus vaccines stockpiled when the pandemic hit. “In theory, we should be able to respond quickly if this becomes an issue.”What to do for the birdsIn time, wild birds will likely develop some immunity to the current H5N1 virus, causing the panzootic to wane. It’s not clear how long that will take, Puryear said, because “this scale of HPAI in wild birds hasn’t occurred before.”But there are ways to help wild birds short of waiting for them to gain natural immunity. Countries including the US, for example, could ramp up surveillance, so they can better understand how avian flu is spreading, scientists say. That information could help give farmers a heads-up if infected species are moving their way.In the US, the Department of Agriculture (USDA) and USGS lead surveillance, together with state agencies. Those agencies do most of the field-based sampling, Hill said. According to Puryear, however, government officials simply don’t have the resources or funding to keep up with the outbreak. “They are slammed,” she said.Part of the problem, I’m told, is that USDA is primarily focused on protecting the poultry industry. Controlling outbreaks on farms draws a lot of the agency’s resources that could otherwise go toward wild birds.“Wild bird surveillance is a critical part of USDA’s response to highly pathogenic avian influenza,” USDA spokesperson Lyndsay Cole told Vox. The agency and its partners tested more than 30,000 wild birds last year, Cole said. The agency also emphasized that studying the virus among wild birds is important because it can spread between wild and domestic populations. “While there is always room to expand efforts, the surveillance that has been done has been invaluable in identifying how the virus is spreading and where introductions to domestic birds occur,” Cole said.Academic institutions like Tufts and the University of Georgia, which both do testing, help fill in some of the gaps in surveillance, but those projects cost money, Puryear said. On that note, one solution is to free up more federal funding for groups that are equipped to surveil and test wild birds for H5N1, she said. Surveillance would also benefit from government and state agencies talking to each other more, many scientists told me. (Cole of USDA said the agency is able to “coordinate closely” with its partners to carry out surveillance.)The public can help, too, Hill said.Birders are “the eyes and ears of this panzootic,” she said, “and I don’t think they’re being harnessed enough.” People are used to photographing beautiful wildlife on their phones and uploading it to platforms like iNaturalist. But right now, it’s more important that they document dead birds, she said. (iNaturalist actually has a webpage exactly for this purpose. If you find a dead wild bird and are not sure what to do, check out this one-pager from the USDA.)Ultimately, protecting wild birds and reducing the risk of a pandemic will require that we make much bigger changes, such as to our food system. The normal way many companies raise birds for slaughter — in warehouses, packed tightly with chickens or turkeys — is a recipe for highly pathogenic viruses, Hill said.“It’s useful to remember that wild birds are the victims here,” Hill said. “They spread HPAI but are not the original source. My motto has become: Bird flu sucks, blame chicken nuggets.”You’ve read 1 article in the last monthHere at Vox, we're unwavering in our commitment to covering the issues that matter most to you — threats to democracy, immigration, reproductive rights, the environment, and the rising polarization across this country.Our mission is to provide clear, accessible journalism that empowers you to stay informed and engaged in shaping our world.

This data can be translated into evidence-based information for policy-makers that can be used to enhance prevention measures at national, regional and global levels. Eastern Mediterranean Flu (EMFLU) is a standardized data collection electronic platform for sharing epidemiological and virological data on influenza in WHO’s Eastern Mediterranean Region. It was designed and is maintained by WHO’s Regional Office to support countries of the Region. An upgraded version of this platform, EMFLU-2, was initiated in 2019. The updating process was accelerated due to the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the need to integrate different respiratory pathogens within the sentinel influenza surveillance system. EMFLU-2 was piloted in a number of countries in the Region, including Saudi Arabia. Feedback from countries during the piloting phase helped to fine-tune the upgraded version for a successful roll out of EMFLU-2 in the Region. To prepare for the next pandemic, EMFLU-2 acts as a regional respiratory viral surveillance platform that is flexible enough to monitor multiple emerging and re-emerging respiratory pathogens, fostering the integration approach adopted by WHO at regional and global levels. Building capacities In December 2022, a team from WHO conducted an EMFLU-2 training of trainers course for focal points from Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Health at central and regional levels. They were trained on the platform’s new features, from data entry, monitoring and coordination between EMFLU-2 users to map navigation and report development. The upgraded version is user-friendly with simple interface features that increases the utility of the tool for end users at sentinel sites, ministries of health and laboratories. Moreover, it is designed to allow different access levels for different users in the system, promoting country ownership. From the initial stages of its implementation of influenza surveillance, Saudi Arabia has shown considerable improvement. In 2019, it was ranked first among all countries in the Region with respect to regular and timely data-sharing. An EMFLU-2 training session in Saudi Arabia, December 2022 Rolling out EMFLU-2 “Saudi Arabia’s team will do a great job rolling out EMFLU-2 independently after this training, with more than 100 sentinel sites and a number of regional laboratories in the network, a task that might take a lot of time if exclusively conducted by WHO’s technical team. This reflects the commitment and competency of Saudi Arabia’s team”, says Engineer Amir Aman, a technical expert from the Regional Office. He notes that EMFLU-2, with its many upgraded features, will enable the capturing of influenza sentinel data along with data on SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses of epidemic and pandemic potential, in harmony with the country’s integration roadmap. Rolling out EMFLU-2 in Saudi Arabia will assist the country in improving its performance indicators when it comes to data quality and monitoring, he adds. “WHO will continue to provide technical guidance and work closely with Saudi Arabia throughout the new set-up process for EMFLU-2 to ensure a smooth transition in the country”, says Dr Rania Attia of the Regional Office.

English India - English USA - Deutsch Brazil - Português Latin America - español USA - español News provided by Novavax, Inc. May 09, 2023, 06:28 ET Share this article Share toX Share this article Share toX This Phase 2 trial is evaluating three vaccine candidates: COVID-Influenza Combination, stand-alone influenza and high-dose COVID Preliminary topline immune responses for all three vaccine candidates were robust versus authorized comparators For the stand-alone influenza vaccine candidate, HAI responses were 31 to 56% higher for all four influenza strains compared to Fluad®, and were 44 to 89% higher for A strains compared to Fluzone HD® For the COVID-Influenza Combination vaccine candidate, anti-S IgG and neutralization responses achieved levels seen in Phase 3 trial with Novavax's prototype vaccine, with HAI responses generally consistent with Fluad® and Fluzone HD® All three vaccine candidates were well-tolerated and demonstrated a reassuring preliminary safety profile, with reactogenicity comparable to authorized comparators These Phase 2 results support continued development for all three vaccine candidates GAITHERSBURG, Md., May 9, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Novavax, Inc. (Nasdaq: NVAX), a global company advancing protein-based vaccines with its novel Matrix-M™ adjuvant, today announced that its COVID-Influenza Combination (CIC), stand-alone influenza and high-dose COVID vaccine candidates all showed a reassuring preliminary safety profile as well as comparable reactogenicity to individual Novavax influenza and COVID vaccine candidates or authorized influenza vaccine comparators. Additionally, all three vaccines demonstrated preliminary robust immune responses. The primary endpoint evaluated the safety of different formulations of the CIC vaccine candidate and the quadrivalent influenza vaccine candidate compared to Fluad®* and Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent®** (Fluzone HD), as well as a high-dose COVID vaccine candidate in adults aged 50 through 80. All three vaccine candidates contained Novavax's patented Matrix-M adjuvant and showed reassuring preliminary safety profiles and reactogenicity that was comparable to Fluad and Fluzone HD. The reactogenicity profile remained consistent as the adjuvant or antigen dose was increased. In all groups there were no adverse events (AE) of special interest, no potentially immune mediated medical conditions and no treatment-related serious AEs. Unsolicited AEs occurred in 25% or fewer of any group and were consistent with diagnoses in the older adult population. Local and systemic symptoms were mostly mild and moderate and occurred at rates comparable to Fluad and Fluzone HD. "The reactogenicity results support our previous observations that this technology is well suited for combination vaccines because large amounts of antigen can be incorporated without impacting tolerability," said Filip Dubovsky President, Research and Development, Novavax. "The immune responses we observed were robust, and the data we have shared today significantly increase the probability of Phase 3 success." The CIC vaccine candidate achieved both immunoglobulin G (IgG) and neutralizing levels comparable to Novavax's prototype COVID vaccine (NVX-CoV2373). In addition, several of the combination formulations achieved responses to both SARS-CoV-2 and to the four homologous influenza strains that were comparable to the reference comparators, supporting their prioritization for advanced development. The stand-alone influenza vaccine candidate achieved statistically significant hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) antibody responses 31 to 56% higher for all four strains compared to Fluad. Titers were 44 (H1N1) to 89% (H3N2) higher for A strains and statistically non-inferior for B-strains compared to Fluzone HD. The highest dose stand-alone COVID vaccine candidate achieved statistically significant anti-S IgG and neutralization responses approximately 30% higher than Novavax's prototype COVID vaccine while maintaining comparable safety and reactogenicity to currently authorized dose level of Nuvaxovid. "Today's positive data are encouraging and further validate the value of our technology platform and its potential to improve global public health," said John C. Jacobs, President and Chief Executive Officer, Novavax. "This is an important milestone in our journey to create additional value and diversify our portfolio of vaccines." About the Phase 2 Trial for CIC, Stand-alone Influenza and High-Dose COVID Vaccine Candidates The Phase 2 Trial is a dose-confirming, randomized, observer-blinded trial evaluating the safety and effectiveness (immunogenicity) of different formulations of the CIC and influenza vaccine candidates, and higher doses of Novavax's COVID vaccine in adults aged 50 through 80. The trial is assessing a CIC vaccine candidate comprised of Novavax's recombinant protein-based COVID vaccine, quadrivalent influenza vaccine candidate and patented saponin-based Matrix-M adjuvant. Primary and secondary objectives of the study are to assess the safety, tolerability and immune responses to various formulations of the CIC, influenza and high-dose COVID vaccine candidates. The Phase 2 dose-confirmation trial is being conducted in two parts. About NVX-CoV2373NVX-CoV2373 is a protein-based vaccine made by creating copies of the surface spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 that causes COVID. With Novavax's unique recombinant nanoparticle technology, the non-infectious spike protein serves as the antigen that primes the immune system to recognize the virus, while Novavax's Matrix-M adjuvant enhances and broadens the immune response. The vaccine is packaged as a ready-to-use liquid formulation and is stored at 2° to 8°C, enabling the use of existing vaccine supply and cold chain channels. About Matrix-M™ AdjuvantWhen added to vaccines, Novavax's patented saponin-based Matrix-M adjuvant enhances the immune system response, making it broader, and more durable. The Matrix-M adjuvant stimulates the entry of antigen-presenting cells at the injection site and enhances antigen presentation in local lymph nodes. About NovavaxNovavax, Inc. (Nasdaq: NVAX) promotes improved health by discovering, developing and commercializing innovative vaccines to protect against serious infectious diseases. Novavax, a global company based in Gaithersburg, Md., U.S., offers a differentiated vaccine platform that combines a recombinant protein approach, innovative nanoparticle technology and Novavax's patented Matrix-M adjuvant to enhance the immune response. Focused on the world's most urgent health challenges, Novavax is currently evaluating vaccines for COVID, influenza, and COVID and influenza combined.

(AP Photo/Richard Vogel) Read More By STEFANIE DAZIO Share Share Copy Link copied Email Facebook X Reddit LinkedIn Pinterest Flipboard Print LOS ANGELES (AP) — The California condor is facing the deadliest strain of avian influenza in U.S. history, and the outbreak could jeopardize the iconic vulture with its 10-foot (3.05-meter) wingspan decades after conservationists saved the species from extinction. But nine newly hatched chicks, covered in downy white feathers, give condor-keepers at the Los Angeles Zoo hope that the endangered population of North America’s largest soaring land birds will once again thrive after 40 years of aggressive efforts.With fewer than 350 condors in the wild — in flocks that span from the Pacific Northwest to Baja California, Mexico — the historic outbreak means ongoing breeding-in-captivity and re-wilding programs like the LA Zoo’s remain essential.Over the past year and a half, millions of birds across the U.S. have died from avian flu, including more than 430 bald eagles and some 58 million turkeys and commercial chickens that were euthanized to prevent the spread of the disease. Bird flu is further suspected in the deaths of dozens of seals off the coast of Maine last summer. Already, the strain is believed to have caused the deaths of at least 22 California condors in Arizona, which were part of a flock in the Southwest that typically accounts for a third of the species’ entire wild population. Experts are now concerned the strain could further impact condors by rapidly spreading across state lines through the spring migration. More than two dozen environmental advocates this week urged the federal government to expedite approvals for a vaccine that would be given to both condors in the wild and in captivity. The advocates, which include the Center for Biological Diversity, warned in a letter that the flu strain is “jeopardizing the existence” of the famed bird.“The California condor is at risk of extinction once again, and once again, an emergency vaccination campaign is required to stave off a deadly infection and possible extinction,” they wrote, referencing the success of the West Nile Virus vaccine for condors in the early 2000s. As the 50th anniversary of the Endangered Species Act approaches, wildlife officials say the species still cannot sustain itself without human intervention — even though humans are also to blame for much of its losses outside the avian flu, including deaths from lead ammunition poisoning.“I think it’s going to take some changes in behavior from the humans on the planet so that we can really address the threats to the species,” said Ashleigh Blackford, the California condor coordinator for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.Despite a California law banning it for hunting, lead ammunition is still readily used. The condors scavenge meat from dead animals, felled by the lead ammunition, and fall ill — often fatally.“It’s really hard to watch a bird you raised come back and die in your arms,” said Los Angeles Zoo condor-keeper Chandra David, who has tended to lead-poisoned condors brought back to the zoo for treatment. “And there’s nothing we can do about it.” Still, spring is a time for hope. At breeding programs in the U.S. and Mexico, chicks are hatching and online “condor cams” provide live feeds for fans. AP correspondent Stefanie Dazio reports Bird flu threatens the California condor’s flight from extinction “It’s a funny species in that it really is not your typical charismatic species, right? They are a little bit on the ugly side. Most people are not endeared to vultures, but this one in particular (is different),” Blackford said.Regardless, the condor looms large in California culture — even if it’s not the official state bird (that’s the California quail). The mascot for the Los Angeles Clippers is Chuck the Condor and one of the birds in flight is featured prominently on the state quarter.The population was nearly wiped out by hunting during the California Gold Rush, as well as poisoning from toxic pesticide DDT and lead ammunition.In the 1980s, all 22 California condors left in the wild were controversially captured and put into captive breeding programs to save the species. Zoo-bred birds were first released into the wild in 1992 and in the years since have been reintroduced into habitats they’d disappeared from — including the Yurok Tribe’s ancestral lands in Northern California. The ongoing re-wilding efforts are considered a conservation success. “It took decades to drive species toward extinction and it’s, in many cases, going to take decades to bring them back,” said Noah Greenwald, endangered species director for Center for Biological Diversity.The condor is intrinsically tied to several Native American tribes in the West. The Havasupai people, for example, say the condor flew their ancestors from the bottom of the Grand Canyon to the top -- its wings creating the famous striations.For the Yurok Tribe, the work to bring the condors back highlights how Native Americans are reclaiming their traditional roles as stewards of the land — “which was a role that was taken from us forcibly post-contact,” said Tiana Williams-Claussen, director of the tribe’s wildlife department. Known as prey-go-neesh in Yurok, the revered condor disappeared from the region in the late 1800s. In 2021, Williams-Claussen and her team, building on a promise made by tribal leaders in 2003, watched as captive-bred condors took flight over Yurok lands for the first time in more than a century.The tribe hopes to release four to six captive-bred birds into the wild annually over the next two decades.“Ultimately our goal, of course, is to have birds without tags, without transmitters, that can just reintegrate into our ecosystem,” Williams-Claussen said, “into our cultural lifeways again.” STEFANIE DAZIO Dazio covers crime and criminal justice in California for The Associated Press, with a focus on Los Angeles.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images) Washington just had its deadliest flu season in five years, the Department of Health said Thursday. Following two years of low flu activity – likely due to reduced exposure during the COVID-19 pandemic – the state saw a “tenfold” increase in deaths this year compared to last. For the 2022-2023 season, 262 Washington residents died from influenza, including five children. Last year, only 26 people died from the flu. The uptick follows national trends, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimating as many as 57,000 flu deaths this season, compared to 5,000 deaths last year. Outbreaks at Washington’s long-term care facilities also increased significantly, with 138 outbreaks reported this year, compared to 16 last year. Many precautions taken during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as masking and social distancing, likely led to the low flu numbers in the past two years, Secretary of Health Dr. Umair Shah said in a news release. Now that those measures are lifted and the COVID-19 public health emergency comes to an end, health officials say the flu will likely spread faster. Precautions, such as getting a yearly flu vaccine, washing their hands, staying at home if sick and wearing masks in crowded spaces, can all help slow the spread, according to the department. “The flu vaccine is your best protection against this serious disease,” Shah said. “Even if you get the flu, if you’ve been vaccinated, typically your illness is milder, and you aren’t as likely to need to go to the hospital.” According to the CDC, the flu vaccine reduced hospitalization by nearly three quarters for children and by nearly half for adults. Still, flu vaccinations are down nationally compared to pre-pandemic rates, especially among pregnant people and children, who are some of the most vulnerable to severe flu disease. In Washington, flu activity peaked in November, but it is currently at minimal levels, as of last month.

Think again. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everybody gets an annual flu vaccine for those that are six months and older. The more effective way to fight off the flu is to get a flu vaccination. Getting vaccinated can reduce visits to the doctor, missed work and school, flu illnesses, and possibly prevent hospitalizations. The CDC estimates that tens of thousands of Americans die annually due to the devastating effects of the flu. There are no excuses to not get vaccinated; you can help prevent the flu today! Here are several symptoms commonly associated with the flu: Fever over 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius) Aching muscles, primarily in your legs, arms, and back Weakness and fatigue Nasal congestion Sweats and chills Headache The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and CDC highly recommend that healthcare centers begin providing flu vaccinations shortly following their availability. It is best to get vaccinated at least a couple weeks before flu season begins because it takes approximately two weeks for the flu vaccine to start producing antibodies that would protect against the flu virus.

By TZVI JOFFRE MAY 7, 2023 01:38 Updated: MAY 7, 2023 08:18 Northern Gannets Morus bassanus on Bass Rock (photo credit: Odd Wellies/Wikimedia Commons) The irises of Northern Gannets, a type of seabird, turn black if they recover from highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza, according to a new pre-print study published last week.Northern Gannets were one of the species severely impacted by the ongoing bird flu outbreak affecting Europe and the Americas.The study, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, examined Gannets at Bass Rock in the UK, after researchers noticed that some of the seabirds had unusual black irises instead of the usual blue. The researchers took blood samples from 18 apparently healthy adult Gannets with both normal and black irises and tested the samples for bird flu antibodies. Eight of the birds tested positive, seven of which had black irises.The scientists noted that black irises may serve as a likely indicator of prior infection with avian influenza. The researchers added that the one infected bird with blue irises may have been infected with a different subtype of avian influenza, waning antibody levels or it may be that not all infected birds develop black irises. A closed road leading to a chicken farm is seen after an outbreak of bird flu in the village of Upham in southern England February 3, 2015. (credit: PETER NICHOLLS/REUTERS)Two additional birds with black irises tested negative for the virus, with the researchers suggesting that the birds may have been previously infected but had already lost the antibodies.Black eyes have been reported in gannets once before, although the reason is unknown. Gannets with black irises have also been reported in other colonies in the UK, France, Germany and Canada. “This has been a fascinating development and the discovery may prove a useful non-invasive diagnostic tool," said Dr. Jude Lane, a conservation scientist at the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) and lead author of the study. "The next steps are to understand its efficacy, if it applies to any other species and whether there are any detrimental impacts to the birds’ vision. Ophthalmology exams will also be needed to determine what is causing the black coloration.”According to the RSPB, outbreaks of avian influenza were recorded last year in Iceland, Scotland, Canada, Germany and Norway, including at Bass Rock, the world's largest Gannet colony.The researchers found that the estimated survival of adult birds was 42% lower than the preceding 10-year average, although the full extent of mortality among the birds won't be confirmed until the birds come back this breeding season.

"Due to the long running research effort on the Bass Rock, it was possible to gain important insights into the changes taking place in the colony with a strong link emerging between virus infection and the changing iris color in these striking seabirds and the high level of nest failure within the study area.”The study was conducted by researchers from the RSPB, the University of Glasgow, the University of Edinburgh, Heriot Watt University and the Animal Plant Health Agency in partnership with the Scottish Seabird Centre.In the past two years, large outbreaks of the H5N1 subtype have spread across Europe and the Americas in what has been described as "the largest-ever" outbreak on both continents, with additional outbreaks reported across the world. In recent months, increasing numbers of mammals have been found to be infected with the virus, with mass die-offs of seals and sea lions reported in Russia and the Americas and dozens of foxes, skunks, dolphins, raccoons and cats found to be infected as well. The outbreak has been widely affecting both birds and mammals. In the US alone, over 58 million poultry have been affected and 6,715 infected wild birds have been found in almost every state. In Europe, thousands of wild and domestic birds were found to be infected in over 24 countries, with many sea birds affected.Avian flu killed twice as many wild birds in UK as previously estimatedAdditionally, on Friday, The Guardian found that avian influenza has killed more than twice the number of wild birds previously estimated, with at least 50,000 wild birds affected by the outbreak.The British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) estimated that “many more than 20,000” wild birds had died in the UK since the current outbreak began about a year and a half ago in October 2021, but the Guardian studied data from regional governments and nature organizations and found that at least 50,000 birds died due to the bird flu from October 2021 to April 2023.Even this number is likely to still be a gross underestimate, as there is no national monitoring in the UK and most carcasses are never found or counted, according to The Guardian.Russia accuses US of 'studying ways to spread bird flu'Additionally, on Friday, the chief of Russia's Radiation, Chemical and Biological Protection Force, Igor Kirillov, accused the Pentagon of working through Ukraine's Science and Technology Center to assess the conditions which would cause the uncontrolled spread of bird flu in the Azov-Black Sea region, according to TASS.TASS reported the claim with the headline "Pentagon studied ways to spread bird flu via Ukrainian center, top brass says."Kirillov claimed that a project called P-444 monitored avian influenza among wild birds in the region and assessed "under what conditions the virus’ transmission would become uncontrolled, cause economic damage and create risks for food security."Throughout the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russian authorities and media have repeatedly published claims that Ukrainian and American authorities were conducting "military-biological projects," including biological weapons research. The claims have been widely spread by conspiracy theorists on social media and some talk shows.Sign up for the Health & Wellness newsletter >> Related Tags United Kingdom health scientific study Virus research bird flu Hot Opinion Dear Jared Kushner, the Jewish people need you By JPOST EDITORIAL To recover, Democrats must expel anti-Zionist extremists who put off Middle America By AMOTZ ASA-EL Leaders of the Jewish enemies have always died as weak cowards By URI PILICHOWSKI How will the recent US election affect Iran, Russia, and North Korea?

BY BERNT NELSON, AFBF economist May 8, 2023 May 8, 2023 Updated May 8, 2023 6 min to read Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save Since the first case of the 2022/2023 highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreak was detected in the U.S. – in a turkey flock – on Feb. 7, 2022, the virus has affected 58.8 million birds in 831 flocks in 47 states. All levels of the supply chain have felt impacts from HPAI, from the farmer facing the risk of depopulation, all the way up to the consumer paying record prices for eggs and turkey due to tighter supplies. This Market Intel provides an update of the status of HPAI in the United States including the measures USDA has taken and what steps might be taken to mitigate the risks and impacts of HPAI in the United States.Then & NowThe current outbreak of HPAI H5N1 is much different from the H5N2 outbreak in 2015. The first case of the 2015 outbreak occurred on Dec. 11, 2014, with the last detection occurring on June 16, 2015. Then, the virus accelerated quickly. Affected birds jumped from 0 to 30 million in the first nine weeks. A total of 211 commercial detections occurred, along with 21 detections in backyard flocks. Approximately 43 million egg-layers/pullet chickens and 7.4 million turkeys were affected in 21 states over about seven months.The current outbreak has been different than the 2015 outbreak in a few ways. First, the current outbreak has been going on for about twice as long as the one in 2015. Second, there have been far more birds affected overall, along with more detections in backyard flocks in the current outbreak. Some of this may be a result of an uptick in backyard flocks during the COVID-19 pandemic.The HPAI H5N1 virus strain has been circulating the globe for many years and continues to evolve into different groups called “clades.” The current clade, 2.3.4.4b, was first detected in wild birds in the United States in late 2021 and is well adapted to spread throughout wild birds and poultry. This is a new virus for wildlife and strains can continue evolving. Migratory waterfowl, more specifically dabbling or puddle ducks, are the main vector for the virus. Dabbling ducks, such as mallards and teal, are shallow water ducks that feed near the surface by tipping headfirst into the water to graze on vegetation and insects. The H5N1 virus has been found far less in other types of migratory waterfowl. ResponseUSDA continues to take a reactive approach to mitigating the spread of HPAI. Reactive measures were able to contain the virus until detections dropped off. Now the amount of the virus being found in wild birds is astounding. USDA has stated that 85% of HPAI is introduced to a flock through outside factors such as wild birds, while only 15% is introduced by lateral movement (from one house to another). USDA is not able to quantify how many cases biosecurity is keeping out of barns. While these reactive measures have been effective, this disease is no longer being seen as something that comes and goes, it is being considered a long-term problem.USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has three goals for its response to HPAI:1) Detect, control and contain HPAI in poultry as quickly as possible.2) Eradicate the HPAI virus using strategies to protect public health and the environment, and stabilize animal agriculture, the food supply and the economy.3) Provide science- and risk-based approaches and systems to facilitate continuity of business for non-infected animals and non-contaminated animal products.APHIS follows three principles to contain, control and eradicate HPAI in the U.S. poultry population:1) Prevent contact between the HPAI virus and susceptible poultry. This is the biosecurity portion of the APHIS response. This is accomplished by quarantining infected poultry along with biosecurity procedures to protect non-infected poultry. Under certain circumstances, accelerated depopulation of poultry at risk of exposure may be warranted. Stringent biosecurity measures should include cleaning, disinfecting and avoiding contact between poultry and anything that may have been in contact with HPAI including people.2) Stop the production of the HPAI virus by infected or exposed animals. This is accomplished by rapid mass depopulation and disposal of infected and potentially infected poultry. Proper disposal of depopulated poultry is extremely important. Predatory birds can feed on exposed carcasses, leading to further spread of HPAI.3) Increase the disease resistance of susceptible poultry to the HPAI virus or reduce the shedding of HPAI in infected or exposed poultry. This would be accomplished through the strategic implementation of an emergency vaccine, should a suitable vaccine become available.Indemnity ProgramUSDA offers an indemnity program for birds and eggs that are destroyed due to HPAI. This program has compensated growers with nearly $416 million in indemnities. So far in the 2022/2023 HPAI outbreak, only 21 flocks have had repeat detections responsible for a total of $75 million in indemnities. This program does not pay for birds that were killed by HPAI itself, only those that must be de-populated. Since HPAI can move quickly through a flock it is important to promptly report dead birds as soon as they are found to begin the inventory process. USDA indemnity values are based on national average prices and are updated annually using data from USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service, Livestock Market Information Center and other sources. Click here for more information on the indemnity program and instructions on filing a claim.Potential Audit ProgramAPHIS would like to introduce an audit process to fix weak areas in an operation after detections. The party being audited would be responsible for compliance. Operations that do not comply with the required changes would face reduced indemnity payments if a repeat detection occurs.Proactive ResponsesOne proactive strategy APHIS has taken is implementing its Defend the Flock education program. This program, founded in 2018, offers free tools and resources to help anyone who handles poultry to follow proper biosecurity practices. APHIS provides resources such as videos, webinars, posters, workbooks and even games and activities in the Flock Defender Toolkit. The toolkit guides producers through protecting their flocks by preventing wildlife access, reducing food and water sources that are attractive to potential carriers of the virus, and disposing of carcasses in ways that do not attract predatory birds.VaccinationAnother proactive or preventative approach to controlling HPAI is vaccination. APHIS says that more work needs to be done before it can conclude that vaccination is the best strategy, but the modern virus strains are forcing non-vaccinating countries to consider vaccination.Vaccines for HPAI have been point of conflict across epidemiologists and across countries because countries that vaccinate are often thought of as endemic for the disease and risk losing export markets. Many countries across the world, including the United States, do not allow vaccinated poultry to be imported out of concern that vaccines could mask the spread of the virus by allowing infected birds to slip in undetected. APHIS estimates that 80 trade partners (countries) would be lost if the United States began vaccinating under current trade policies. Using 2022 values, this would result in about $6.2 billion in losses.Countries that consume most of their poultry products domestically, like China, have used vaccination to combat HPAI for years. HPAI was first detected in China in 1996 and China began vaccinating against the virus in 2002. China’s vaccination strategy has demonstrated effectiveness and has reduced the incidence of H5N1 in poultry and humans but has not eliminated the virus. A viable vaccine for clade 2.3.4.4b of H5N1 is not expected to be produced for another 18-24 months. The lack of incentive for pharmaceutical companies to make this a priority because of the policy and trade implications of vaccinating flocks is a big obstacle. However, it is more important than ever to have a vaccine available to deploy alongside a vaccination strategy should the outbreak become severe enough.One concept being introduced as a tool to promote trade is DIVA (Differentiate Infected from Vaccinated Animals). The goal of DIVA is to allow detection of infected birds distinct from vaccinated because trading partners will not accept infected birds. This strategy could be used to assure trading partners that poultry has not been exposed to HPAI.France has ordered 80 million doses of a vaccine for HPAI. They will be the first to jump into the fire and see how other countries respond. Many countries will be paying close attention to France to see how policies may need to be adjusted.Cage-Free ProductionNine states have passed legislation that only allows the sale of eggs from hens raised under cage-free standards. Farms that operate using cage-free methods are expected to increase from 31% of operations in 2023 to as high as 50% by 2025. There are trade-offs associated with different poultry housing systems. Housing systems that allow hens to perform natural behaviors, for example, may expose hens to more disease and risk of natural injury, while improving disease and injury control by confining hens may limit a hen’s ability to engage in natural behaviors. Cage-free systems that allow more freedom of movement make it more difficult to consistently vaccinate and/or boost a flock if a vaccination protocol was implemented. Click here for more information on comparing cage and non-cage housing systems.Summary & ConclusionsThe APHIS response to the current HPAI outbreak is proving effective in controlling the spread of the virus. The current virus strain is well adapted to spread through migratory waterfowl and to mutate. Now is the time to develop a proactive plan in case the outbreak becomes more severe. A viable vaccine is still 18-24 months from being ready to distribute. Being labeled as endemic for HPAI is a barrier to vaccination because it could cause costly trade disruptions. The U.S. is not ready to begin using vaccines as a tool to fight high path AI, but it is essential that a plan is ready in case the need arises. One thing is certain, HPAI now is not the same as it was in 2015, and, unfortunately, it isn’t expected to go away anytime soon.

The activation and disorder of immune function play an important role in the severity of influenza virus infection. This study aims to investigate whether early lymphocyte count and cytokines can provide predictive value for the progression in children with influenza B virus pneumonia.Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted to analyze the clinical data of children with influenza B virus pneumonia from December 1, 2021, to March 31, 2022, in the National Children’s Regional Medical Center (Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University). According to the severity of the disease, the children were divided into a mild group and a severe group, and the clinical characteristics, routine laboratory examination, lymphocyte subsets, and cytokines were compared.Results: A total of 93 children with influenza B virus pneumonia were enrolled, including 70 cases in the mild group and 23 cases in the severe group. Univariate analysis showed that drowsiness, dyspnea, white blood cell (WBC), lymphocytes, monocytes, procalcitonin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), fibrinogen (FIB), Immunoglobulin M (IgM), lung consolidation, total T cell count, CD4+ T cell count, CD8+ T cell count, NK cell count, NK cell % and B cell % had statistical differences between the mild and severe groups (P<0.05). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, reduced ALT (OR = 1.016), FIB (OR = 0.233), CD8+ T cell count (OR = 0.993) and NK cell count (OR = 0.987) were independently associated with the development of severe influenza B virus pneumonia.Conclusions: The levels of T lymphocytes and NK cells were related to the progression of influenza B virus pneumonia in children, and the reduction of CD8+ T cell count and NK cell count can be used as independent risk factors for predicting the severity of influenza B virus pneumonia.1 IntroductionThe influenza virus is one of the most common pathogens of respiratory infectious diseases. Globally, the annual incidence of influenza in children is estimated at 20% to 30%, and about 28,000 children under 18 years of age die of influenza-related lower respiratory tract infections, with most deaths occurring in children under 4 years of age (Park and Ryu, 2018; Troeger et al., 2019). Among all types of influenza viruses, influenza A and B are particularly common. We usually refer to the peak of influenza virus infection in the year as influenza season. In Northern hemisphere countries, influenza A infection peaks in January and February, and influenza B infection peaks in February and March (Bhat, 2020). Compared with the influenza A virus, the influenza B virus is rarer and usually occurs locally or seasonally rather than causing a pandemic. However, the influenza B virus is highly contagious and causes more severe disease and higher mortality than the influenza A virus (Gavigan and McCullers, 2019). Epidemiological and clinical studies on the influenza B virus mostly focus on adult patients, but children have a higher susceptibility to the influenza B virus and a greater risk of complications, hospitalization, and death (Paul Glezen et al., 2013; Koutsakos et al., 2016; Nayak et al., 2021).The most common complication for hospitalized patients with influenza virus infection is pneumonia (Kalil and Thomas, 2019), the typical pathological changes are interstitial pneumonia, and severe patients may have lung parenchymal damage. Characteristic alveolar pathological changes of severe influenza virus pneumonia include capillary thrombosis, focal necrosis, congestion of alveolar walls, inflammatory infiltration, hyaline membrane formation, and pulmonary edema. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to influenza greatly increases the difficulty of treatment, and even requires extracorporeal life membrane oxygenation (ECMO) treatment based on invasive mechanical ventilation, along with a higher mortality rate, heavier social burden, and increases serious pulmonary sequelae. In addition to direct damage to the airway and alveolar epithelium through the inherent pathogenicity of the influenza virus, the involvement of a strong immune response is also an important aspect of aggravating lung injury (Herold et al., 2015). The influenza virus first infects alveolar or airway epithelial cells. Viral RNA in the cytoplasm is recognized by RIG-I, TLR3, TLR7 and NLR to activate the innate immune response, and the TLR pathway activates downstream IRF3 and IRF7 to regulate IFN production. Viral RNA binds to the RIG-I receptor, triggering its interaction with MAVS to activate NF-κB, and MAVS and NLR activate the inflammasome to release IL-1β and IL-18 in response to viral RNA, resulting in the formation of cytokine storm (Gu et al., 2021; Keskinidou et al., 2022), which directly damages the pulmonary capillary endothelium and participates in the formation of pathological changes. The activation of adaptive immune response contributes to the clearance of the virus, while excessive immune response will induce excessive production of pro-inflammatory factors. The balance of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines is particularly important for the disease’s incidence, severity, and mortality.In the epidemic season of 2021-2022, there was an epidemic of influenza B among children in Northeast China, a high proportion of hospitalized influenza-like patients had pneumonia, and some patients had serious extrapulmonary complications. Therefore, we conducted a retrospective cohort study to investigate whether the early lymphocyte subsets counts and cytokines levels in the blood of children with influenza B virus pneumonia could provide a solid base for predicting the development of the disease.2 Materials and methods2.1 PopulationThis study was a retrospective cohort study, patients’ information was collected through the Hospital Information System (HIS). This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University (Approval number: 2022PS1030K). We enrolled patients (28 days to 14 years old) hospitalized with acute lower respiratory tract infection symptoms and diagnosed with influenza B virus pneumonia from December 1, 2021, to March 31, 2022, in the National Children’s Regional Medical Center (Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University). Pneumonia is defined as the presence of fever (temperature>37.5°), acute respiratory symptoms (cough, shortness of breath, dyspnea) or both, and new infiltration shadow or consolidation not attributable to other causes on chest imaging (McIntosh, 2002). Influenza virus infection is defined as the presence of influenza-like symptoms during influenza season and a positive throat swab for influenza B virus (Uyeki et al., 2019). Inclusion criteria: (1) Meet the diagnostic criteria for pneumonia. (2) Meet the etiological diagnostic criteria for clinical diagnosis of influenza B virus pneumonia. Exclusion criteria: (1) Patients with primary immunodeficiency and secondary immunodeficiency, such as long-term immunosuppressants and malignant tumors; (2) Patients with hospitalization history within 14 days before this admission; (3) The length of hospitalization is less than 24 hours. Evaluation criteria for severity of influenza B virus pneumonia: the patient who meets the above inclusion and exclusion criteria, combined with one or more of the following complications is defined as severe influenza B virus pneumonia, including acute respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, secondary bacterial pneumonia, sepsis, myositis, rhabdomyolysis, acute myocarditis, acute pericarditis, acute encephalitis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, transverse myelitis, aseptic meningitis, and Guillain Barre syndrome (Chow et al., 2019; Kalil and Thomas, 2019), the remaining patients are defined as mild influenza B virus pneumonia. The study flow chart is shown in Figure 1.FIGURE 1 Figure 1 Flow chart of the study design and enrollment.2.2 MeasurementsNasopharyngeal swabs were obtained within 24 hours after admission, and influenza B virus RNA was detected in exfoliated cells by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or nucleic acid hybridization. Venous blood samples were collected within 24 hours after admission, flow cytometry analysis was used to detect the absolute count and percentage of the total T cell (CD3+), CD4+ T cell (CD3+CD4+), CD8+ T cell (CD3+CD8+), NK cell (CD16+CD56+), the total B cell (CD19+) on the surface of lymphocytes, and the ratio of CD4+/CD8+ (Th/Ts). We used BD™ Cytometric Bead Array (CBA)Kit based on flow cytometry detected cytokines (IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17, INF-γ, IL-12p70, IL-1β, TNF-α) in peripheral blood.2.3 Statistical analysisThe SPSS software (V26.0, IBM, New York, USA) was adopted for statistical analysis. Normally distributed continuous variables were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (x ± s) and compared with a t-test. Non-normally distributed continuous variables were expressed as the median value (P25, P75), and the Mann–Whitney U rank sum test was used to compare the two groups. Categorical data were presented as n (%) and compared using a Chi-square test. Logistic regression analysis was performed to test the risk factors. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.3 Results3.1 Clinical characteristics and radiologic findings93 children diagnosed with influenza B virus pneumonia were divided into a mild group (n = 70) and a severe group (n = 23). There were no statistical differences in gender and age between the mild and severe groups (P>0.05). There were differences in the types of underlying diseases between the two groups. The proportion of patients with congenital heart disease in the severe group was higher than that in the mild group (P<0.05, Table 1).TABLE 1 Table 1 Analysis of clinical characteristics and radiologic findings between the mild and severe group in influznza virus B pneumonia.All the children had respiratory symptoms as the main clinical manifestations, including fever, cough, runny nose, and tachypnea. In addition to respiratory symptoms, a few patients combined with drowsiness, diarrhea, or rash. Among 93 children with influenza B virus pneumonia in our study, there were 5 cases of co-infection with pathogenically confirmed bacteria. 6 cases were complicated with acute encephalitis. 3 cases were complicated with hemophagocytic syndrome. 11 cases suffered from acute respiratory failure (8 cases of type I respiratory failure, and 3 cases of type II respiratory failure), including 5 cases with ARDS. Of the 93 patients, 18 were admitted to Pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), and 3 died. All 3 deaths were due to respiratory failure caused by infection exacerbation of the primary disease.White blood cells (WBC), lymphocytes, monocytes, albumin, fibrinogen (FIB), and Immunoglobulin M (IgM) in the severe group were significantly lower than those in the mild group (P<0.05). The levels of procalcitonin (PCT), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the severe group were higher than those in the mild group (P<0.05). There were no significant differences in the levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), D-Dimer, creatinine, urea, Immunoglobulin G (IgG), and Immunoglobulin A (IgA) levels between the two groups (P>0.05). Lung imaging showed bilateral pneumonia was more common than unilateral pneumonia. The proportion of lung consolidation in the severe group was higher (P<0.05). The median length of stay in hospital in the severe group was longer than that in the mild group (P<0.05), and no statistical differences in the total course of disease, febrile days, and maximum temperature during the course of illness (P>0.05). As shown in Table 1.3.2 Lymphocyte subsetsThe absolute count of total T cell, CD4+ T cell, CD8+ T cell, and NK cell in the severe group was significantly lower than those in the mild group (P<0.05). There was no significant difference in total B cell count and CD4+/CD8+ ratio between the two groups (P>0.05). Our study showed that the percentage of total T cell, CD4+ T cell, and CD8+ T cell were no statiscally difference between the two groups (P>0.05), but the percentage of NK cell in the severe group was lower than that in the mild group, the percentage of total B cell was higher (P<0.05). As shown in Table 2.TABLE 2 Table 2 Comparisons of lymphocyte subsets between the mild and severe group in influznza virus B pneumonia.3.3 CytokinesThe levels of cytokines IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17, INF-γ, IL-12p70, IL-1β, and TNF-α were similar between the mild group and the severe group (P>0.05, Table 3).TABLE 3 Table 3 Comparisons of cytokines between the mild and severe group in influznza virus B pneumonia.3.4 The multivariate logistic regression analysis for developing severe influenza B virus pneumoniaWe excluded the factors by performing collinearity diagnostics on the predictors that were statistically significant in the univariate analysis, and finally included WBC, PCT, FIB, Albumin, ALT, CKMB, IgM, the percentage of NK cell and total B cell, CD8+ T cell count, CD4+ T cell count and NK cell count to conduct a multivariate logistic regression analysis, using the method of “back wald”. It revealed that ALT (OR = 1.016) was an independent risk factor for developing severe influenza B pneumonia, while CD8+ T cell count (OR = 0.993), FIB (OR = 0.233) and NK cell count (OR = 0.987) were protective factors (Table 4).TABLE 4 Table 4 The multivariate logistic regression analysis for developing severe influenza B virus pneumonia.4 DiscussionCellular and humoral immunity plays a key role in the body’s defense against viral infections, and activation and disruption of immune function have a significant impact on disease progression and prognosis. Our findings revealed that dysfunction in cellular immunity, especially changes in T lymphocytes and NK cells, were associated with the severity of the disease. As a key component of the immune system, CD4+ T cells significantly impact lung inflammation and lung injury caused by influenza virus infection by producing a large number of cytokines and coordinating with other immune and non-immune cells (Zens and Farber, 2015). CD4+ T cells stimulate B cell activation and differentiation. CD4+ T cells also assist in the differentiation of CD8+ T cells into cytotoxic effectors and memory cells, as well as the localization of memory CD8+ T cells in the infected respiratory tract. Furthermore, cytotoxicity, which has the potential to directly eliminate infected cells, is an increasingly proven function of CD4+ T cells (Swain et al., 2006; Sant et al., 2018). CD8+ cytotoxic T cells recognize virus-infected cells, induce apoptosis, and produce proinflammatory cytokines to inhibit viral replication, such as IFN-γ (Piet et al., 2011). The absolute counts of total T cell, CD4+ T cell and CD8+ T cell in the severe disease group were lower than those in the mild disease group. Furthermore, our results showed no statistical difference in the CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratio between the mild and severe groups, that is, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell decreased proportionally. Numerous studies on the influenza A virus have shown that a decrease in peripheral blood leukocytes, lymphocytes and lymphocyte subsets is an immune process of the body in the early stages of the disease (Chiappini et al., 2011; Cheng et al., 2019; Shi et al., 2019). Early studies have also shown that total lymphocyte count, CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cell were significantly decreased in the acute phase in adults with influenza B virus pneumonia (Xu et al., 2013). Our study confirmed the same findings in children, in general agreement with the study of Ying Ding et al (Ding et al., 2013). In recent years, we have found that respiratory viral infections often trigger a decrease in lymphocytes in the peripheral blood. Previous studies have suggested that this may be related to virus-induced T cell destruction, B Liu et al. demonstrated that influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 infection can trigger thymus cell apoptosis and thymic atrophy (Liu et al., 2014). Whether the influenza B virus causes T lymphopenia in the same way, is not known, but this could be an alternative explanation for the predominance of T lymphocytopenia. However, it is now generally believed that this is due to the convergence of peripheral memory T cells to the lung after viral infection, causing a decrease in T lymphocytes in the peripheral blood.During the 2009 pandemic, it was shown that specific CD8+ T cell levels were inversely correlated with disease severity caused by infection with the H1N1pdm09 virus (Sridhar et al., 2013). Taoran Geng et al. divided adult influenza patients into mild, severe, severe survival, and severe death groups, and found that the level of CD8+ T cell in severe patients was lower than those in mild patients (Geng et al., 2020), this is consistent with the results of our study. It suggests that CD8+ T cell play a key role in the body’s defense against influenza virus infection, and the results of our study revealed that CD8+ cell acted as an independent protective factor. Similarly, as a respiratory virus, the relationship between the severity of COVID-19 and the immune response is a focus of attention. A large number of studies have shown that CD4+, CD8+ T cell and NK cell were significantly reduced in COVID-19 patients, and were associated with COVID-19 severity and prognosis, and both CD8+ and CD4+ T cell served as diagnostic markers of COVID-19 and predictors of disease severity (Huang et al., 2020; Jiang et al., 2020).One of the important functions of humoral immunity in influenza virus infection is antibody-mediated virus neutralization. Although previous studies have found that B lymphocytes decreased in adult patients after influenza B virus infection (Xu et al., 2013), the level of B lymphocytes was similar between the mild and severe groups in our study. In the total lymphocyte, the percentage of B lymphocytes in the severe group was higher than that in the mild group, this is a consequence of the greater reduction in T lymphocytes and NK cells in the severe group in our study. However, there is no report that it is related to the severity of the disease, and the comparison of B lymphocytes between children with influenza and healthy children needs to be further studied. Abira Paramsothy et al. reported that patients with severe influenza A H1N1 infection have high levels of functional humoral immune response and low levels of antibody affinity and proposed that antibody levels increase with the severity of the disease and speculated that high viral load can enhance the humoral immune response (Paramsothy et al., 2021). In contrast, we compared serum immunoglobulins and found that early IgM levels in the severe group were significantly lower than in the mild group, and we hypothesized that reduced early serum IgM led to a weakening of the neutralizing effect of the virus and aggravated the severity of the disease.Natural killer (NK) cells are the early line of defense against influenza virus infection. Before the adaptive immune response initiation, NK cells not only produce antiviral-related cytokines but also directly participate in the rapid clearance of virus-infected cells and interact with dendritic cells to directly regulate the adaptive immune response (Jost et al., 2011). In a mouse model of influenza A virus infection, increased aggregation of NK cell in the lung can be observed, but the role of circulating and tissue NK cell in antiviral immunity is not yet fully explained (Björkström et al., 2022). During acute seasonal or pandemic H1N1 infections, a decrease in the absolute number of NK cell can be observed, and reduced or absent NK cell activity leads to delayed viral clearance and increased morbidity and mortality (Denney et al., 2010). It was shown that although the affinity of the influenza B virus for NKp46 was lower compared to the influenza A virus, it did not affect its clearance by NK cell (Duev-Cohen et al., 2020). Our results showed that in the early stage of influenza B virus pneumonia, the level of NK cells was significantly lower in the severe group. In addition, the percentage of NK cell was lower in the severe group, which makes our conclusions more convincing. The clinical symptoms were more prominent in the severe group, causing more organ dysfunction in addition to pneumonia, including 3 cases of the combined hemophagocytic syndrome, which is more evidence that NK cell plays an important role in the progression of influenza B virus infection.Cytokines are involved in regulating the balance between humoral and cellular immune responses and in regulating the maturation, growth, and response of specific cell populations, IL-1β, IL-8, and IFN-γ are pro-inflammatory factors, which are involved in the early response and amplification of the inflammatory response, while anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-10 and IL-13 limit the inflammatory response. The influenza virus is a pathogen with high morbidity and mortality, and excessive levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines are thought to be associated with extensive tissue damage and the development of influenza-related complications (Liu et al., 2016). Analysis of infected children during the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) virus pandemic revealed that levels of IFN-γ, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and other cytokines were higher in pneumonia patients than in non-pneumonia patients (Takano et al., 2011). Yu Xie et al (Xie et al., 2021) examined sputum specimens from patients with severe and non-severe influenza A virus pneumonia, found elevated levels of IL-6, IFN- γ, and IL-2 in patients with severe influenza A pneumonia and significantly higher levels of IL-2 and IL-6 in non-surviving patients than in survivors. This suggests that influenza virus infection triggers elevated cytokine levels and correlates with clinical disease severity and prognosis.We studied IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17, IFN-γ, and TNF-α and found that early cytokine levels were not significantly related to the severity of influenza B virus pneumonia, which is inconsistent with previous studies on cytokines in influenza A. Masatoki Sato et al. examined serum concentrations of IFN-c and IL-4 representing Th1 and Th2 cytokines in children with influenza and found that serum levels of IFN-c and IL-4 were higher in patients with influenza A than in those with influenza B. The high ratio of IL-4 to IFN-c and the predominance of Th2 cytokine production after influenza A suggest differences in the immune response system between influenza A and B infections (Sato et al., 2009). This may be one reason why our results were inconsistent with them. In addition, this may be related to the stage of our testing, as cytokine testing in children is usually performed within 24 hours of admission, while some patients were still in the progressive stage of the disease and not at the most severe point of the disease. Although the levels of cytokines in the early stage of influenza B virus pneumonia in our study were no statistical differences, the relationship between the levels of cytokines and the severity of influenza B virus pneumonia in children needs dynamic monitoring and to be further determined, which needs to be proved by dynamic clinical studies with large samples.Our study showed that WBC in severe group was lower than that in mild group, and the overall decrease in leukocytes should be mainly contributed by lymphocytes. ALT, AST, CKMB, and LDH were significantly higher in severe group, which can indicate the existence of more extensive tissue damage in severe patients. It is related to the immune response and the intensity of inflammatory damage after infection and has certain implications on clinical recognition of the severity of influenza B virus pneumonia. CRP, a non-specific marker of inflammation, was similar between the two groups, this is consistent with previous study (Ahn et al., 2011). It has been reported that patients with bacterial co-infection had significantly higher serum CRP levels than patients with HIN1 infection alone (Ahn et al., 2011). In our study, although 5 children in the severe group had a bacterial infection, we tested CRP within 24 hours of admission, and it usually peaks at 24-48 hours. Procalcitonin is often used as a marker to distinguish non-infectious diseases from sepsis, but it is also associated with liver injury, central nervous system injury, and lung injury in addition to bacterial infection. In our study, procalcitonin in severe group was higher, which was not only related to secondary bacterial pneumonia in some cases but also suggested that the severe group was complicated with other tissue damage based on influenza B virus pneumonia. Influenza virus directly damages the endothelium of pulmonary capillaries and can cause coagulation dysfunction, DIC, and pulmonary embolism (Yang and Tang, 2016). Unlike the results of ferret model (Goeijenbier et al., 2014), the coagulation abnormalities in our study were not significant and the FIB was lower in severe group, which was considered that the increase of FIB means that the body’s stress state and vascular repair ability was stronger during severe infection. The pulmonary imaging of children with influenza B virus pneumonia was mostly bilateral pneumonia, and consolidation was more common in severe cases, and some of them complicated with hydrothorax, which is a differential point between influenza B virus pneumonia and COVID-19 pneumonia during the epidemic (Liu et al., 2020; Kuang et al., 2021).Host factors are relevant to the severity of influenza illness, including underlying diseases such as heart disease, lung disease, or neurological disorders (Doyle and Campbell, 2019). A study of influenza B virus pneumonia in adults showed that chronic respiratory disease was independent risk factor for influenza B virus pneumonia in adult patients (Dai et al., 2020). Children with congenital heart disease were more likely to develop severe influenza B virus pneumonia in our study. Unfortunately, there were only 9 cases of children with underlying diseases, which failed to conduct multivariate logistic analysis. Although the number of deaths in our study was too small to analyze the risk factors for death, all 3 death cases suffered from underlying diseases. One of them combined with neuromuscular disease, it is consistent with the results of the study that chronic neurological diseases were independent risk factors for mortality of influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 in children (Chow et al., 2019). The COVID-19 pandemic has also shown that the risk of infection and mortality increases with the increase of the underlying diseases (Rahman et al., 2021). Previous studies have shown that influenza A virus infection combined with bacterial infection is a risk factor for death in children. In our cohort study, there were 5 cases of combined bacterial infections and no death cases. Whether influenza B virus pneumonia combined with bacterial infection is different from that of influenza A and does not increase the risk of death remains to be verified by large sample studies.There are several limitations in our study. First, this is a small sample, single-center retrospective study, which may exist selection biases. Second, we lack comparisons of lymphocyte subsets and cytokines between children with influenza B virus pneumonia and healthy children. Finally, we lack data on dynamics throughout the course of the disease. The research on the changes in lymphocyte subsets and cytokines in children after influenza B virus infection remains to be in-depth.5 ConclusionInfluenza B virus infection in children should not be underestimated, in whom pneumonia is common. Severe cases need intensive care, mechanical ventilation, and other active treatment measures. It is important to monitor the immune status of children with influenza B virus pneumonia in the early stage. Early declines in CD4+, CD8+ T cells, and NK cells were associated with the direction of disease progression, the depression of CD8+ T cell and NK cell were independent risk factors for the development of severe influenza B virus pneumonia.Data availability statementThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation.Ethics statementThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University.

Is a poultry vaccine the answer? • Kentucky Lantern HOME NEWS Economy Environment Government Health Decision 2024 Commentary ABOUT SUBSCRIBE DONATE Part of States Newsroom Economy Environment Government Health Decision 2024 15:56 News Story Uncategorized The U.S. is undergoing its worst bird flu outbreak ever. Is a poultry vaccine the answer? By: Adam Goldstein - May 12, 2023 3:56 pm Bird flu has decimated poultry flocks and contributed to spikes in U.S. egg prices. (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images) WASHINGTON — The deadliest outbreak of bird flu in U.S. history is prompting growing concern in Congress, and Department of Agriculture researchers are awaiting the preliminary results of four trials of vaccines for poultry. Some lawmakers are warming to the idea of a vaccination campaign, long considered a fringe idea due to the cost and potential consequences. Trade groups warn that vaccinated poultry would not be accepted in many overseas markets, disrupting exports. While bird flu likely poses little health danger to humans, it’s contributed to spikes in U.S. egg prices and decimated poultry flocks. Among the domestic poultry affected are chickens, turkeys, pheasants, quail, ducks and geese — in both big commercial operations and increasingly popular backyard flocks. Since the current strain of highly-pathogenic avian influenza — H5N1 — began circulating in the country in February 2022, farmers across the country have lost or had to cull more than 58 million poultry birds. The USDA estimates it has already spent more than $670 million in insurance indemnities and sanitation services to combat the ongoing bird flu outbreak. And with many wild birds starting their spring migration, roughly 140,000 poultry birds were infected with the virus nationwide in April. While food costs are stabilizing, members of Congress from both parties are asking how the U.S. can do better at controlling bird flu. “We’ve all seen first-hand how high pathogenic avian flu has devastated domestic poultry populations, where depopulations have had to take place,” said Rep. Jim Costa, a California Democrat, at an April 18 House Agriculture Committee hearing. “We’ve got to continue to refine and improve our approach to address animal disease, and USDA needs all the tools to guarantee a robust response.” The USDA is testing two proprietary vaccines developed through its Agricultural Research Service, as well as bird flu vaccines from pharmaceutical companies Merck Animal Health and Zoetis, Inc. But animal health experts note that a bird flu vaccine is not the immediate solution that some believe it to be. Jenny Lester Moffitt, undersecretary for marketing and regulatory programs at the USDA, said at an April 24 press event that it will take a minimum of 18 to 24 months to produce a viable vaccine, which is not guaranteed to be effective against infection. Yuko Sato, a poultry veterinarian and associate professor at Iowa State University in Ames, Iowa, said at an April 26 media event that “the vaccine is not a silver bullet” for an end to the outbreak. “You would have to make sure that if you vaccinate — but still have positive birds — you can stamp out the virus,” Sato said. “Otherwise, we’ll never be looking at eradicating the virus from the United States.” Here are the answers to some common questions about the ongoing bird flu outbreak and potential vaccines: What is highly-pathogenic avian influenza? Highly-pathogenic avian influenza, commonly known as HPAI, bird flu, or “high-path,” is a deadly respiratory virus that affects wild birds and poultry. The contagious disease comes from the Influenza A family, and is characterized by the H5 or H7 categories of hemagglutinin — or spike protein — structures on its surface, which it uses to infect cells. The virus is spread via airborne transmission, or exposure to the byproducts of an infected bird, like saliva, mucus or feces. Poultry and other domesticated birds with the disease will often exhibit a lack of energy, produce soft-shelled or misshapen eggs, and have swollen heads. The highly-pathogenic version of the disease was first identified in China in 1996, and has mutated several times over the last three decades through swapping genetic material with low-pathogenic avian influenza strains within wild birds. David Swayne, former director of the Agricultural Research Service’s Southeast Poultry Research Lab in Athens, Georgia, said at an April 26 media briefing that 87% of avian influenza strains are made up of blended genetic material from other strains. He said that this natural mutation process can make a vaccine less effective against the virus year over year. Wild migratory birds are the primary transmission vector in the current outbreak, accounting for roughly 85% of disease spread, according to the USDA. These animals, including terns, ducks, and geese, can contract and pass along the disease without obvious physical symptoms. Yet an HPAI infection spreads quickly among a flock of poultry, with infections leading to mortality at a rate of 90% to 100% in chickens and turkeys, often within 48 hours, according to the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. When a farmer detects the disease in a commercial flock, the only USDA-recommended option is to kill the remaining birds, dispose of the carcasses, and decontaminate the facility to mitigate spread. Who is getting infected? Should I be worried? Despite the threat H5N1 presents to poultry, experts with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say that people do not need to brood over getting sick. The agency reports that 11 cases of bird flu have been reported among humans since 2021, with only one “mild” case occurring in the United States. And as of 2023, there have been no reported cases of human-to-human transmission of HPAI, according to the World Health Organization. Swayne said at the media event that only 875 human cases of H5 bird flu have been reported since 1996. About 40% were fatal. He noted these infections have occurred largely among humans handling domesticated poultry, and not from encounters with wild birds. The USDA has documented 176 mammals in the United States infected with the disease since 2022, including skunks, foxes, seals, and mountain lions, among other species. Wildlife experts from the U.S. Geological Survey published a study in April finding much of this disease spillover can be traced back to predation on wild birds. Still both Swayne and Hill pointed to a recent event in which 3,500 sea lions became infected with the virus in Peru as one worth monitoring for mutations that could affect mammals. How does the current outbreak compare to past bird flu outbreaks? The current iteration of the highly-pathogenic avian influenza virus was first detected domestically on Jan. 13, 2022, in a wild bird in Colleton County, South Carolina. The first domesticated animal case of the disease was found on a turkey farm in Dubois County, Indiana, on Feb. 8, 2022. Since then, the disease has spread across 47 states, affecting more than 833 commercial and backyard poultry flocks. Still, this is not the first outbreak of HPAI that the federal government has responded to. And despite the scope of these numbers, many animal health experts say current USDA efforts represent a significant improvement over earlier outbreaks of the disease. Sato recalled that a 2015 outbreak of HPAI, previously considered the worst outbreak on record, required the culling of 50.4 million birds on Midwestern poultry operations. She added that 70% of the cause of new infections from that outbreak was farm-to-farm lateral spread from workers in 21 states, including Arkansas, Iowa, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, Nevada, Oregon, South Dakota, and Wisconsin. In contrast to that outbreak, Sato said that now “we’ve done a really good job with biosecurity.” Biosecurity refers to preventive measures producers can take to limit spread of the disease, like disinfecting farm machinery and providing clean clothing and protective equipment to farmworkers. Sato said that with producers embracing these practices, the lateral spread of avian influenza decreased from 70% of reported cases in 2015 to roughly 16% of reported cases in 2023. Moffitt added that efforts to control the virus are projected to cost the country less than 50% of its 2015 expenditures of $1.6 billion. However, animal disease experts caution that the U.S. is dealing with a more widely dispersed and distinct disease than that of the 2015 HPAI outbreak. Nichola Hill, an assistant professor of biology at the University of Massachusetts, said at the April 26 media event that researchers have detected the virus in 150 of the approximately 1,000 wild bird species found in the U.S., and the disease has affected more than 6,000 wild birds. Greg Tyler, the president and CEO of USA Poultry and Egg Export Council, said that this version of the disease has also gotten into all four major migratory flyways for wild birds in the U.S. Sato said that more backyard flocks of poultry are being affected by the spread of bird flu from migratory populations — a total of 507 small to mid-sized flocks — in contrast to the 21 backyard flocks affected in 2015. There are also new concerns emerging among experts that this deadly disease could become endemic to North America without significant public-private collaboration to reduce spread, according to an April study from researchers at the University of Maryland. “Federal agencies, state agencies, the agriculture sector and wildlife management — we are all going to have to deal with this together, because we can’t afford not to,” said Jennifer Mullinax, an assistant professor in the University of Maryland Department of Environmental Science and Technology, in a release. What about a vaccine? While some animal health experts say developing a vaccine for the current bird flu strain could be a valuable tool, trade experts caution that a national vaccination strategy would not come quickly, or without tradeoffs for the nation’s $6 billion poultry export industry. Sato said that a national vaccination strategy for the roughly 10 billion commercial-purpose birds in the United States could be time-intensive, and cost billions of taxpayer dollars. Tom Super, senior vice president of communications at the National Chicken Council, said that his organization does not support the use of a vaccine for HPAI right now, as most countries do not accept exports from countries that vaccinate for the virus. These non-tariff trade barriers are designed to protect other nations’ unvaccinated poultry flocks from immunized birds that still carry the disease. Super added that if the U.S. vaccinates domestic birds, the broiler industry will be cut off from exports, costing billions of dollars to the U.S. economy every year. Tyler added that his organization found that if a vaccination campaign happens without adjustments to trade policy, there could be a potential loss of 200,000 farm jobs. Moffitt said that negotiations between the USDA and foreign partners are still ongoing to maintain international poultry export markets for certain states amid outbreaks in others in the country. Tyler said that the Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service and Foreign Agricultural Service have made significant progress in developing regionalization agreements with foreign governments since 2015. He noted that the U.S. poultry industry has managed roughly $11.7 billion in exports over the last two years, despite the ongoing challenges of HPAI and bans on poultry exports by certain countries like China. Super and Tyler both advocated for continued funding for the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service to provide rapid-response support to farms. Moffitt urged adhering to biosecurity measures like interstate surveillance and the Defend the Flock program at the April 18 hearing. Moffitt cited that the number of infections in commercial flocks in March 2023 decreased tenfold compared to March 2022, proof the USDA’s current strategy of rapid tests and reporting is working. “We know how to respond quickly, so producers can get back to producing food, how important biosecurity is, how to keep markets open,” she said. “We know what to do, and we are ready.” XThe U.S. is undergoing its worst bird flu outbreak ever. Is a poultry vaccine the answer? by Adam Goldstein, Kentucky Lantern May 12, 2023 The U.S. is undergoing its worst bird flu outbreak ever. Is a poultry vaccine the answer? by Adam Goldstein, Kentucky Lantern May 12, 2023 WASHINGTON — The deadliest outbreak of bird flu in U.S. history is prompting growing concern in Congress, and Department of Agriculture researchers are awaiting the preliminary results of four trials of vaccines for poultry. Some lawmakers are warming to the idea of a vaccination campaign, long considered a fringe idea due to the cost and potential consequences. Trade groups warn that vaccinated poultry would not be accepted in many overseas markets, disrupting exports. While bird flu likely poses little health danger to humans, it’s contributed to spikes in U.S. egg prices and decimated poultry flocks. Among the domestic poultry affected are chickens, turkeys, pheasants, quail, ducks and geese — in both big commercial operations and increasingly popular backyard flocks. Since the current strain of highly-pathogenic avian influenza — H5N1 — began circulating in the country in February 2022, farmers across the country have lost or had to cull more than 58 million poultry birds. The USDA estimates it has already spent more than $670 million in insurance indemnities and sanitation services to combat the ongoing bird flu outbreak. And with many wild birds starting their spring migration, roughly 140,000 poultry birds were infected with the virus nationwide in April. While food costs are stabilizing, members of Congress from both parties are asking how the U.S. can do better at controlling bird flu. “We’ve all seen first-hand how high pathogenic avian flu has devastated domestic poultry populations, where depopulations have had to take place,” said Rep. Jim Costa, a California Democrat, at an April 18 House Agriculture Committee hearing. “We’ve got to continue to refine and improve our approach to address animal disease, and USDA needs all the tools to guarantee a robust response.” The USDA is testing two proprietary vaccines developed through its Agricultural Research Service, as well as bird flu vaccines from pharmaceutical companies Merck Animal Health and Zoetis, Inc. But animal health experts note that a bird flu vaccine is not the immediate solution that some believe it to be. Jenny Lester Moffitt, undersecretary for marketing and regulatory programs at the USDA, said at an April 24 press event that it will take a minimum of 18 to 24 months to produce a viable vaccine, which is not guaranteed to be effective against infection. Yuko Sato, a poultry veterinarian and associate professor at Iowa State University in Ames, Iowa, said at an April 26 media event that “the vaccine is not a silver bullet” for an end to the outbreak. “You would have to make sure that if you vaccinate — but still have positive birds — you can stamp out the virus,” Sato said. “Otherwise, we’ll never be looking at eradicating the virus from the United States.” Here are the answers to some common questions about the ongoing bird flu outbreak and potential vaccines: What is highly-pathogenic avian influenza?

The reclassification of COVID-19 to Class 5 means decisions on anti-coronavirus prevention measures are now up to individuals and businesses. But experts are still calling on the government to ensure medical institutions can properly respond to another potential future surge in the number of infections. The government has removed most of its guidelines, such as quarantine periods of seven days for people who test positive for the disease and five days for those who have been in close contact with an infected person. Residents of Japan are also to be charged for coronavirus-related outpatient care and hospitalization, although subsidies are available for expensive treatment. COVID-19 patients will also receive medical treatment in ordinary hospitals instead of designated facilities. People walk in front of JR Osaka Station on May 8, 2023. Japan downgraded the legal status of COVID-19 to the same category as seasonal influenza the same day. (Kyodo) The disease was categorized in 2020 as a special public health threat equivalent to or stricter than Class 2, which covers infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS. The government formally decided on April 27 to downgrade the coronavirus' legal status as the vaccination program, among other factors, has made the disease less deadly, while calls for rejuvenating the pandemic-hit economy have grown. The preparedness of the health care system to withstand a future outbreak was also taken into account. Under the reclassification, the government will also no longer legally be able to recommend hospitalization for coronavirus patients or declare a state of emergency, under which governors were able to request the reduction of opening hours for businesses and could close or impose fines for those that did not comply. The government said that around 8,300 medical institutions, comprised of 90 percent of hospitals nationwide plus some clinics, will have the capacity for up to 58,000 COVID-19 inpatients by the end of September, with around 44,000 institutions accepting outpatients, up from 42,000 last month. Japan has already lifted its rules on the wearing of face masks from March 13, leaving the decision up to individuals. Despite the relaxation on face coverings, the majority of commuters around Tokyo Station on Monday morning still wore masks. Toru Yamanaka, a 44-year-old banker in the capital, said he "can't take off" his face covering when on crowded trains because almost everyone else is masked. He said he would "look at what everyone else is doing" at work before deciding on how to approach the issue. Outside Osaka Station in western Japan, too, there were numerous masked travelers. While waiting for a bus, 86-year-old Noriaki Kuwabara was surprised as he had "expected there to be more people with their masks off." The government lifted COVID-19 border controls for all arrivals on April 29, the start of the annual Golden Week holiday period, meaning entrants are no longer required to present certification of at least three coronavirus vaccination doses or a negative coronavirus test taken within 72 hours of departure. Even after the downgrade, coronavirus vaccinations will remain free of charge until the end of March 2024, and subsidies of up to 20,000 yen ($148) a month will be provided for coronavirus-related hospitalization until September this year. On Monday, the government began vaccination programs for the elderly and those with underlying diseases, alongside medical and nursing care workers, for the current fiscal year that began in April. For some, it will be their sixth round of inoculation. For students who become infected, the government has said they should be absent for five days after showing symptoms, and for one day after they have recovered. People walk in front of JR Tokyo Station in the Japanese capital on May 8, 2023. Japan downgraded the same day the legal status of COVID-19 to the same category as seasonal influenza and greatly relaxed its intensive medical rules, marking a major shift in its approach after three years of dealing with the coronavirus. (Kyodo) ==Kyodo The government also offers similar guidance to others in response to calls from nursing care providers who wish to know when they can return to work after becoming infected. Even after patients recuperate, the government recommends they wear a face mask for 10 days and refrain from coming in contact with the elderly or others at higher risk of developing serious symptoms. Issues remain, however, around providing a suitable environment for the elderly at medical facilities and institutions, as infections continue to be reported nationwide. At the Tokyo metropolitan government's comprehensive coronavirus consultations call center that began operations Monday, phones were ringing constantly. An official said the center "cannot let its guard down" against infections. The reclassification of the virus and the easing of public health measures could make it difficult to effectively monitor the number of infections in Japan if they begin rising again, said Tetsuya Matsumoto, a professor at the International University of Health and Welfare. "The medical system, which appears to be improving, may not actually have the capacity to sufficiently respond. The challenge is how to steadily increase the number of medical institutions that can receive patients," Matsumoto said.

There are plants that like these emissions and can scrub them from the atmosphere, which makes a difference downwind,” said Patterson at 2023 PEAK, a poultry production tradeshow held in in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Industry experts, research suggests that viruses can be aerosolizedWhile there is little research documenting how bacteria and viruses are aerosolized, there are anecdotes that suggest this, explained Patterson.“We know a lot of about structural and procedural biosecurity, but we've really not documented the impact of aerosolized virus particles and what can be done to mitigate that,” he said.Patterson referenced an anecdote from Diamond V Technical Services Specialist Dr. Eric Gingrich that examined a farm exposed to avian influenza on the outside of a poultry house. He said the virus came through the inlets on one side of a house, and those birds in that area of the house tested positive for HPAI.“The virus did not really migrate to the rest of the farm. It was the northwest facing wall that took the aerosolized virus into the inlets and infected those birds,” he explained.Additionally, Patterson cited an Iowa State University research study that examined the role of airborne transmission in windy states, one being Iowa, in the spread of 2015’s HPAI outbreak.That study found 97% of the HPAI cases in Iowa could have potentially received virus-laden air from previously infected farms in the state. However, the infection risk could be affected by the house’s inlet type, flock size and distance from a previously infected farm. What should producers do?“Viruses can be associated with vapor and aerosolized from a bird’s nasal or respiratory system. Viruses could also come from fecal material, aerosolize with the wind and travel long distances,” Patterson said.If producers have a multi-species vegetative buffer to protect their farm, for example, some with hairy or sticky leaves, these can help trap aerosolized particles. Patterson suggests contacting a local Natural Resources Conservation Services (NRCS) office for recommendations on what vegetation to use.While vegetative buffers could be beneficial in preventing the spread of HPAI, much more research needs to be conducted, he added.RecommendedLatest NewsNational Turkey Federation offering 'Thanksgiving 101' tips and recipesLatest NewsHormel Foods honoredRelated StoriesAvian InfluenzaFrance further eases avian flu control measuresAvian InfluenzaGlobal poultry industry is fighting HPAI, not spreading itAvian InfluenzaU.K. poultry set free from avian flu housing orderAvian InfluenzaCongress concerned about replacing aging APHIS staffMore in Avian InfluenzaAvian InfluenzaAvian flu confirmed in poultry flocks in 13 European countriesThe H5N5 variant has been confirmed for the first time at a European poultry farm.Brand InsightsVaccination success depends on crew trainingZoetisContinuous evaluation and training are critical to improving pullet vaccination accuracy.Avian Influenza8 more British Columbia flocks struck by avian fluSo far in 2024, the province has had 22 commercial poultry flocks affected by the virus.Avian InfluenzaLatest Canadian HPAI infections involved variety of speciesOne more flock infection has been reported in Abbotsford, British Columbia.Avian InfluenzaHPAI hits 5 flocks in British Columbia, 1 in CaliforniaAPHIS provides additional information concerning two broiler flocks previously reported as confirmed cases.Avian InfluenzaAustralia commits more funds to H5N1 preparednessAustralian authorities add additional funds to surveillance, biosecurity, vaccines and communications in the face of possible H5N1 incursion.Avian InfluenzaAPHIS updates report on California HPAI casesFlock size numbers for two of four affected operations have been disclosed.Avian InfluenzaMore HPAI reported in California, British Columbia poultryBoth the state and the province have confirmed cases in two commercial flocks.Avian InfluenzaFirst avian flu outbreaks of the season in East AsiaHPAI cases have been reported in poultry and wild birds across Asia from Israel to Japan and South Korea.Avian InfluenzaAvian influenza strikes two California broiler flocksThe number of chickens involved has not yet been disclosed.North AmericaAvian flu infections continue to hit British ColumbiaThe province has had six commercial poultry flocks affected by the virus since October 21.Avian InfluenzaFrance confirms avian flu in vaccinated flocksDucks were found to be positive for the HPAI virus following routine testing, despite them showing no symptoms of the disease.Avian InfluenzaAvian flu hits second broiler flock in California countyThe latest flock infection in Tulare County involved 6,000 broilers.Page 1 of 182Next PageNews and analysis for the global poultry industryFollow WATTPoultry.comFacebook iconLinkedIn iconYouTube iconDelete My DataTopicsPoultry MeatEggPoultry HealthSustainabilityPoultry FutureMoreWebinarsBrand InsightsPodcastsWhite PapersWATT Poultry ChatTop Companies Data DownloadsMagazinesSubscribeAdvertiseAbout UsContact UsMedia RequestPrivacy PolicySite Map© 2024 All rights reserved.Research: New ways of capturing influenza A, Ebola viruses are under development, ET HealthWorld Login Get App News HospitalsFinanceDiagnosticsPeople MovementM&APharmaPolicySlideshowsResearchMedical DevicesIndustryView all News Exclusives Leaders Speak Events Awards Webinars Brand Solutions More Newsletters MasterClasses About Us Contact Us Advertise With Us Search Pharma Policy Medical Devices Diagnostics Industry Hospitals More Industry 4 min read Research: New ways of capturing influenza A, Ebola viruses are under development Using electron scanning and computer simulations, research teams from Heidelberg University and Heidelberg University Hospital explored the last phases of viral penetration in an interdisciplinary approach.

Telegram Facebook Copy Link ANI Updated On May 7, 2023 at 06:01 PM IST Read by: 100 Industry Professionals Read by 100 Industry Professionals Heidelberg: Viruses such as influenza A and Ebola infiltrate human cells in a series of phases.Using electron scanning and computer simulations, research teams from Heidelberg University and Heidelberg University Hospital explored the last phases of viral penetration in an interdisciplinary approach.They were able to discover how the immune system fights off the virus in the instance of influenza A by employing a tiny protein.They determined that in order for an Ebola virus infection to take hold, a certain protein structure must be deconstructed. These mechanisms rely heavily on so-called fusion pores, which allow the viral DNA to enter the host cell. If they are prevented from developing, the virus is also prevented from spreading. The Heidelberg researchers describe previously undiscovered pathways that could lead to novel approaches to infection prevention. Advt Many viruses that infect humans are covered with a lipid membrane that has glycoproteins that can dock with human cells. In viruses like influenza A, which enter through the respiratory tract, these are the spike proteins that mainly bind to epithelial cells in the nose and lungs. In contrast, the highly infectious Ebola virus spreads through direct contact with infected bodily fluids and can penetrate a broad spectrum of cell types. After invading human cells, these viruses must open a fusion pore between the virus membrane and the host membrane to release their genome into the host cell and propagate.To fight off the virus, the human immune system attempts to block the formation of the fusion pore in a multi-stage process. Infected cells sense the presence of the foreign genome and send a signal, in the form of an interferon molecule, to as yet uninfected cells. This signal triggers the uninfected cells to produce a small cellular protein called interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3). "This specialised protein can effectively prevent viruses such as influenza A, SARS-CoV-2, and Ebola from penetrating, but the underlying mechanisms were unknown," states virologist Dr Petr Chlanda, whose working group belongs to the BioQuant Center of Heidelberg University and the Center for Integrative Infectious Disease Research of Heidelberg University Hospital. The researchers were now able to demonstrate that for influenza A viruses, IFITM3 selectively sorts the lipids in the membrane locally. This prevents the fusion pores from forming. "The viruses are literally captured in a lipid trap. Advt Our research indicates that they are ultimately destroyed," explains Dr Chlanda. To analyse the structural details of viruses, Dr Chlanda and his team took advantage of equipment from the Cryo-Electron Microscopy Network at Ruperto Carola. In an interdisciplinary approach, the research groups led by Prof. Dr Ulrich Schwarz of the BioQuant-Center and the Institute for Theoretical Physics along with Prof. Dr Walter Nickel of the Heidelberg University Biochemistry Center predicted this process with the aid of computer simulations. In the context of antiviral therapy, the researchers believe it is possible to develop lipid-sorting peptides that insert themselves into the virus membrane, rendering the viruses incapable of membrane fusion. "Such peptides could be used in a nasal spray, for example," states Petr Chlanda.In a second study, the Heidelberg researchers investigated the penetration and fusion of the Ebola virus. The filamentous morphology of the virus is determined by a flexible protein envelope known as the VP40 matrix protein layer."It has always puzzled us how this long virus could penetrate the cell, fuse with the membrane, and release its genome," states Dr Chlanda.Using their structural analysis of infected but inactive cells provided by collaborators from the Friedrich Loeffler Institute in Greifswald, the researchers discovered that this virus protein envelope disassembles at a low pH, i.e., in an acidic environment. This step is not least decisive for the formation of fusion pores, as further computer simulations by Prof Schwarz and Prof. Nickel showed.During this process, the electrostatic interactions of the VP40 matrix with the membrane are weakened, thereby reducing the energy barrier of pore formation. The results of the Heidelberg basic research suggest that a blockade of the disassembly of this layer would be one way to maintain Ebola viruses in a state that does not permit fusion pore formation. Similar to the influenza A virus, the Ebola virus would then be lured into a trap from which it could not escape.

(File photo)TOPICS:FluDOHWashingtonVaccineHealthDeathsSeasonPrecautionsOLYMPIA, Wash. — The 2022-23 flu season was one of the deadliest in five years, according to the Washington State Department of Health (DOH).A total of 262 Washingtonians were reported to have died from the flu, including 257 adults and five children, according to the DOH.Flu activity rose in Washington at the end of October and peaked by late November. Whereas at the end of April, there was not nearly as much flu activity, according to the DOH. “While respiratory illness precautions such as masking and social distancing helped keep the number of flu cases low during the COVID-19 pandemic, it’s especially important now that most of us are around other people again to get a flu vaccine every year,” said Umair A. Shah, MD, MPH, Secretary of Health.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported a nationwide estimate that totals as many as 640,000 flu hospitalizations and 57,000 flu deaths between Oct. 1 – April 29, 2023.Flu vaccination rates have decreased nationally in certain groups, while vaccination rates for children dropped more than 6%. The rates for pregnant people decreased by roughly 15% when compared to pre-pandemic rates, according to the DOH.“The flu vaccine is your best protection against this serious disease. Even if you get the flu, if you’ve been vaccinated, typically your illness is milder, and you aren’t as likely to need to go to the hospital," continued Shah, MD, MPH, Secretary of Health.The DOH suggests that you practice healthy habits like frequently washing hands, staying home when sick, and wearing masks in public spaces. All of these could aid in preventing the spread of the flu. The DOH said the following precautions will protect the following groups who are most severely affected by the flu:People over age 65.People who are immunocompromised.Children under age five.Pregnant people.People with chronic health conditions.More information can be found on the Washington State Department of Health’s Flu Overview page.Stay ConnectedLike UsFollow Ussbg-envelopeNewsletter Sign up /sign-up© 2024 Sinclair, Inc.TermsEEOFCCFCCFCCFCCPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesLoading ...Are we on the brink of big flu numbers? - Medical Republic Login/RegisterClinical Latest Public Health Diagnosis Webinars Political Latest RACGP TGA AMA Opinion Latest Comment Humour The Back Page Humoural Theory Red Herring Wild Health 2024 About About Us Join the Medical Republic Subscribe to Newspaper Subscribe to newsletter Past Issues Contact us Advertise with us Login/Register 09 May 2023 Are we on the brink of big flu numbers? 3 minute read Public Health By Cate Swannell This time last year cases were about to explode. Are we about to get hit hard again? If 2023’s flu season proceeds like 2022’s, we are days away from a precipitous rise in case numbers, despite early signs the outbreak may not reach the heights initially feared. The latest Australian Influenza Surveillance Report for weeks 16 and 17 is noncommittal when it comes to predicting severity, saying it is still too early to tell. This time last year, however, the numbers were similarly small but exploded in weeks 18 through 25, suggesting we could be on the brink of this year’s outbreak. Professor Robert Booy, an infectious diseases paediatrician and former head of clinical research at the National Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance, told TMR he was more optimistic. “I doubt this year’s rise will be as impressive, given the recent community immunity induced by last year’s outbreak,” he said. “There’s no surge of people returning from the northern hemisphere either.” Related Clinical This flu season is earlier and probably bigger Respiratory Flu spike points to an early season Influenza and covid continue to be the most prevalent viruses circulating in the Australian population, although flu numbers dropped in the most recently reported fortnight (17-30 April). This year there have been more than 32,000 notifications to the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System in Australia, more than 6000 of them diagnosed in the fortnight to 30 April. There have been 32 influenza-associated deaths this year. Children continue to be the worst hit, with notification rates highest in those aged five to nine, followed by those aged four and under and the 10 to 14-year-olds. “Since seasonal surveillance commenced in April 2023, there have been 224 sentinel hospital admissions due to confirmed influenza, of which 16 (7%) were admitted directly to ICU,” said the report. Influenza A is the dominant strain, accounting for 77% of lab-confirmed cases. This year’s vaccine appears to be a good match to circulating strains. Of the 561 samples referred to the WHO collaborating centres this year, “94.8% of influenza A(H1N1) isolates, 76.6% of influenza A(H3N2) isolates, and 99.1% of influenza B/Victoria isolates characterised were antigenically similar to the corresponding vaccine components”. In the reported fortnight, GPs were seeing influenza-like illnesses in 2.3 per 1000 patient encounters, a slight increase on the previous fortnight, but down on the three per 1000 reported in week 10. So far in 2023, patients presenting to sentinel GPs who were tested for respiratory viruses, 57.7% (120/208) tested positive for a respiratory virus. The most common virus reported was rhinovirus (37.5%). Other viruses detected included influenza (21.7%), SARS-CoV-2 (20.8%), RSV (8.3%), parainfluenza type-2 (3.3%), and adenovirus (2.5%). NSW (10,417 notifications) and Queensland (9233) have had the most lab-confirmed notifications this year, while the Northern Territory rate per 100,000 population (457) outstrips the others so far this year.

Why Is My Fever Lasting Long? One flu that has been widely spoken about recently is H3N2. Let's understand from the doctor about the recovery time and safety precautions. H3N2 Virus: Why Is It Taking So Long To Recover From An Infection? Why Is My Fever Lasting Long? Written by Satata Karmakar |Published : May 7, 2023 4:56 PM IST H3N2 is a subtype of Influenza A Virus. This virus can infect birds and mammals. We have seen a recent surge in cases of this infection in India, H3N2 influenza infection is more severe than A H1N1 or B type in terms of fever symptoms, leukopenia(reduced white blood cell count) and raised CRP( C-Reactive Protein). It presents as any other Viral disease like fever, myalgia, generalized malaise, sore throat, headache, and cough, but the intensity is more severe. Fever is usually for a prolonged period. Symptoms can sometimes last for weeks to even months. Young children and older adults are more prone to this infection. H3N2: What Doctor Wants You To Know About The Recovery TimeToday, in this article Dr Smitha Chouta, Consultant And ENT Surgeon, Ruby Hall Clinic, Hinjewadi, has answered some of the most common questions regarding H3N2 virus infection. How Does It Spread?H3N2 spreads through infected droplets like Coronavirus (Covid-19). So they are contagious. But the two illnesses are caused by different viruses. As the use of masks and social distancing has reduced, the spread of this virus has become more rapid.

This way early detection and intervention are possible. Usually, the treatment is symptomatic and sometimes an antiviral treatment needs to be started. TRENDING NOW How To Stay Safe From H3N2 Infection?As It's a respiratory illness and spreads through droplets, the use of masks is mandatory both Indoors and outdoors. As people don't use masks at home, it is seen the whole family gets infected eventually. Simple hand hygiene goes a long way in preventing the spread of this disease. An early consultation, using a mask, following hand hygiene, drinking plenty of water, gargles, steam inhalation, avoiding cold food and cold environment and social distancing will reduce the severity of the H3N2 virus.
