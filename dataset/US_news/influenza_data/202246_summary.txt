This news article discusses a study that found a link between H7N9 avian influenza virus infection in men and testosterone depletion. The study analyzed sex hormone and cytokine levels in males and females with H7N9 influenza compared to control groups and cases of seasonal influenza. The results showed that H7N9-infected men had significantly reduced testosterone levels associated with poor outcomes. Regression analyses also revealed a negative association between testosterone levels and pro-inflammatory cytokines. The study used a mouse model to confirm these findings, showing that respiratory H7N9 infection led to a reduction in pre-infection plasma testosterone levels. Monitoring sex hormone levels may help individualize management for patients with avian influenza infections, according to the study.
