- The study focuses on influenza A virus infection and the host cell's defense mechanisms.
- The researchers used global genetic loss-of-function screens, transcriptomics, and proteomics data to identify cellular defense mechanisms against influenza A virus.
- They found that the autophagy regulator TBC1D5 inhibits influenza A virus replication by promoting lysosomal targeting of the virus's M2 protein.
- The M2 protein of the influenza A virus interacts with TBC1D5, preventing it from binding to Rab7 and escaping lysosomal degradation.
- These findings provide insight into the molecular mechanism that allows the influenza A virus to evade cellular defense mechanisms and support its replication and growth.
