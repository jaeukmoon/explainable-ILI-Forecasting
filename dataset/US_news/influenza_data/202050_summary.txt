1. Influenza A virus (IAV)-specific CD8+ T-cell response provides protection against pandemic and seasonal influenza infections.
2. The composition of IAV released from infected cells is regulated by the neuraminidase (NA) activity.
3. Cells infected by NA-defective virus cause intracellular viral protein accumulation and cell death.
4. NA-defective viruses, when taken up by dendritic cells (DCs), induce an expression of major histocompatibility complex class I to activate IAV-specific CD8+ T-cell response.
5. Infection by NA-defective IAV induces a CD8+ T-cell response to highly conserved viral antigens and an increasing expression of IL10, IL12, and IL27.
6. Vaccination with NA-defective H1N1 A/WSN/33 induces a strong IAV-specific CD8+ T-cell response against H1N1, H3N2, and H5N1, suggesting potential for the development of universal influenza vaccines.
