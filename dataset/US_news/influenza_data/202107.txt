Through experimental coinfection with influenza A virus (IAV) and either pseudotyped or live SARS-CoV-2 virus, we found that IAV preinfection significantly promoted the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 in a broad range of cell types. Remarkably, in vivo, increased SARS-CoV-2 viral load and more severe lung damage were observed in mice coinfected with IAV. Moreover, such enhancement of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity was not observed with several other respiratory viruses, likely due to a unique feature of IAV to elevate ACE2 expression. This study illustrates that IAV has a unique ability to aggravate SARS-CoV-2 infection, and thus, prevention of IAV infection is of great significance during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Until 13 January 2021, there have been more than 90 million confirmed infection cases and 1.9 million deaths globally (https://covid19.who.int/). The ending time and the final severity of the current COVID-19 pandemic wave are still uncertain. Meanwhile, the influenza season is merging with the current pandemic, potentially bringing more challenges and posing a larger threat to public health. There are many debates on whether seasonal flu will impact the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and whether influenza vaccination is necessary for the coming winter. However, no experimental evidence is available concerning IAV and SARS-CoV-2 coinfection.It is well known that the disease symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 and IAV infection symptoms are quite similar, including fever, cough, pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome.1,2 Moreover, both SARS-CoV-2 and IAV are airborne transmitted pathogens that infect the same human tissues, namely, the respiratory tract and nasal, bronchial, and alveolar epithelial cultures.3,4 In addition, alveolar type II cells (AT2 pneumocytes) appear to be preferentially infected by SARS-CoV-2 and are also the primary site of IAV replication.5,6 Therefore, overlap of the COVID-19 pandemic and seasonal influenza might place a large population under high risk for concurrent infection with these two viruses.7Unfortunately, during the last winter flu season in the southern hemisphere, little epidemiological evidence was collected regarding the interaction between COVID-19 and flu, likely due to a low IAV infection rate resulting from social distancing.8 One case report showed that three out of four SARS-CoV-2 and IAV coinfected patients rapidly develop respiratory deterioration.9 In contrast, another study only reported mild symptoms in limited coinfection outpatients.10 A retrospective study found that the coinfection rate of SARS‐CoV‐2 and influenza virus was as high as 57.3% (among which 49.8% was coinfected with IAV) in a single‐centered study of 307 COVID-19 patients during the outbreak period in Wuhan.11 Thus, the high coinfection rate and the unpredictable clinical outcomes pose great concerns when facing the threat of both viruses.In this study, we tested whether IAV infection could affect the subsequent SARS-CoV-2 infection in both cultured cells and mice. Our results demonstrate that preinfection with IAV strongly enhances the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 by boosting viral entry into cells and elevating the viral load, leading to more severe lung damage in infected mice. These data suggest a clear auxo-action of IAV on SARS-CoV-2 infection, which underscores the great risk of influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2 coinfection to public health.ResultsIAV promotes SARS-CoV-2 virus infectivityTo study the interaction between IAV and SARS-CoV-2, A549 (a hypotriploid alveolar basal epithelial cell line) cells that are susceptible to IAV infection but usually do not support SARS-CoV-2 infection were applied to test whether IAV preinfection would modulate the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2. Pseudotyped VSV luciferase-reporter particles bearing SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (pseudo-SARS-CoV-2) were used to visualize the viral entry.12 The cells were first infected with IAV (A/WSN/1933(H1N1)) or mock-infected for 6 h, 12 h, or 24 h and then infected with the pseudo-SARS-CoV-2 virus for another 24 h (experimental scheme shown in Fig. 1a). The data in Fig. 1b show that A549 cells became highly sensitive (up to 10,000-fold) to the pseudo-SARS-CoV-2 virus after infection with IAV at different doses (from a low MOI of 0.01 to a high MOI of 1, also shown by pseudo-SARS-CoV-2 with an mCherry reporter in Supplementary information, Fig. S1a). In contrast, preinfection with IAV had no impact on pseudotyped VSV particles bearing VSV-G protein (Fig. 1c). We further tested more cell lines and showed that the enhancement of pseudo-SARS-CoV-2 infectivity by IAV was a general effect, although with different degrees (Fig. 1d).Fig. 1: IAV promotes SARS-CoV-2 virus infectivity.a Diagram of the experimental procedure. b A549 cells were infected with A/WSN/33(WSN) at the indicated MOIs. At 6, 12, and 24 h post-IAV infection, cells were infected with pseudo-SARS-CoV-2 for another 24 h. Luciferase activity was measured to reflect virus entry efficiency. P values are from unpaired one-way ANOVA. c A549 cells were infected with WSN at an MOI of 0.1. At 12 h post-IAV infection, cells were infected with VSV-G-Luc for another 24 h. Luciferase activity was measured to reflect virus entry efficiency. d The indicated cells were infected with WSN at an MOI of 0.1. At 12 h post-IAV infection, cells were infected with pseudo-SARS-CoV-2 for another 24 h. Luciferase activity was measured to reflect virus entry efficiency. e Experimental procedure of IAV and live SARS-CoV-2 coinfection. A549 (f), Calu-3 (g), and NHBE (h) cells were preinfected with WSN at an MOI of 0.1 for 12 h. Cells were then infected with live SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of 0.01 for another 48 h. Total RNA in cell lysates and the supernatants was collected to detect the E and N genes via TaqMan-qRT-PCR. The data are expressed as fold changes in viral RNA levels in IAV preinfected cells relative to the non-IAV infection control. Values represent means ± SD of three independent experiments. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001.Full size imageTo validate the above results, we substituted pseudo-SARS-CoV-2 with live SARS-CoV-2 (experimental scheme shown in Fig. 1e). We found that preinfection with IAV strongly increased the copy number of the SARS-CoV-2 genome (E (envelop) and N (nucleocapsid) genes) in both A549 cell lysates (~12- to 58-fold) and supernatants (~10- to 15-fold) (Fig. 1f). Notably, in Calu-3 (Fig. 1g) and NHBE (Fig. 1h) cells that are inherently susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, IAV preinfection further increased SARS-CoV-2 infectivity by > 5-fold.Collectively, these data suggest an auxo-action of IAV on SARS-CoV-2 in a broad range of cell types.IAV and SARS-CoV-2 coinfection in mice results in increased SARS-CoV-2 viral load and more severe lung damageThe K18-hACE2 transgenic mice were used to study the interaction between IAV and SARS-CoV-2 in vivo. Mice were infected with 3 × 105 PFU of SARS-CoV-2 with or without preinfection with 2000 PFU of IAV and were then sacrificed two days after SARS-CoV-2 infection (the experimental scheme is shown in Fig. 2a). The data in Fig. 2b show that there were no significant differences in the body weights of mice between groups within 4 days post-infection (d.p.i.). The viral RNA genome copies from lung homogenates confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 efficiently infected both groups (more than 4 × 109 N gene copies) (Fig. 2c). By contrast, the influenza NP gene was only detected in the IAV preinfection group (Fig. 2d left). Intriguingly, a significant increase in SARS-CoV-2 viral load was observed in lung homogenates from coinfected mice compared to homogenates from SARS-CoV-2 single-infected mice (Fig. 2d middle, 12.9-fold increase in E gene; Fig. 2d right, 6.6-fold increase in N gene). Moreover, there were no significant differences in SARS-CoV-2 viral loads from brains between the single-infected and coinfected mice indicating that coinfection mainly occurred in the lung of infected animals (Supplementary information, Fig. S2). The lung histological data in Fig. 2e further illustrate that IAV and SARS-CoV-2 coinfection induced more severe lung pathologic changes, with massive cell infiltration and obvious alveolar necrosis, compared to SARS-CoV-2 single infection or mock infection.Fig. 2: IAV and SARS-CoV-2 coinfection induced more severe pathology in infected mice.a Diagram of the experimental procedure. K18-hACE2 transgenic mice were first intranasally infected with 2000 PFU of WSN or PBS on day 0. Two days post-IAV infection, mice were intranasally infected with 3 × 105 live SARS-CoV-2 or PBS. On day 4, half of the lung tissues collected from all the mice were homogenized to detect RNA or protein levels. b The body weights and survival were monitored until day 4 (non-IAV treatment group, n = 4; IAV preinfection group, n = 4). The dotted lines indicate the initial weight. The body weights are presented as the mean percentage of weight change ± SD. c The viral genome copy numbers of SARS-CoV-2 N were quantified. Values represent means ± SD of three individual mice. d The relative mRNA levels of IAV NP (d, left), SARS-CoV-2 E (d, middle) and the N gene (d, right) were measured from lung homogenates in the indicated groups and normalized to GAPDH for the individual mouse. The data are expressed as fold changes relative to the non-IAV infection control. Values represent means ± SD of three individual mice. e Histopathologic and immunohistochemical studies were performed with lung slide samples in the indicated groups c–d. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001.Full size imageIAV specifically facilitates SARS-CoV-2 infectionWe further tested whether several other respiratory-transmitted viruses had similar promotive effects on SARS-CoV-2 infection. For this, A549 cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 with or without human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV), human parainfluenza virus (HPIV), or human rhinovirus 3 (HRV3), respectively. To our surprise, none of HRSV (Fig. 3a), HPIV (Fig. 3b), or HRV3 (Fig. 3c) could stimulate pseudo-SARS-CoV-2 infection at neither low nor high infection dose. Quantification of viral genes from HRSV, HPIV, and HRV3 guaranteed the efficient infection of these viruses at 12 h post-infection (h.p.i.) (Fig. 3d–f). Live SARS-CoV-2 virus results also showed no induction under the preinfection of HRSV (Fig. 3g), (Fig. 3h), or HRV3 (Fig. 3i). Again, viral genes from HRSV, HPIV, and HRV3 were quantified at 60 h.p.i. to confirm the sufficient infection of these viruses (Fig. 3j–l). Taken together, these data suggest that IAV has a unique feature to promote both pseudo- and live-SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to HRSV, HPIV, and HRV3.Fig. 3: SARS-CoV-2 infection in response to HRSV, HPIV, or HRV3.a–c A549 cells were preinfected with HRSV, HPIV, or HRV3 at the indicated doses for 12 h. Cells were then infected with pseudo-SARS-CoV-2 for another 24 h followed by measurement of luciferase activity. d–f The propagation of HRSV (d), HPIV (e), or HRV3 (f) in A549 cells was measured by qRT-PCR 12 h.p.i. targeting the individual viral genes respectively. g–i A549 cells were preinfected with HRSV (g), HPIV (h), or HRV3 (i) at the indicated doses for 12 h. Cells were then infected with live SARS-CoV-2 for another 48 h followed by measurement of SARS-CoV-2 E gene copies via Taqman-qRT-PCR. j–l The propagation of HRSV (j), HPIV (k), or HRV3 (l) in A549 cells was measured at 60 h.p.i. by qRT-PCR targeting the individual viral genes respectively. The data are expressed as fold changes relative to the non-preinfection group. Values represent means ± SD of three independent experiments. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001.Full size imageIAV infection induces elevated ACE2 expressionAs IAV strongly increased pseudo-SARS-CoV-2 infection, we examined the viral entry process. It has been reported that the cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2),13,14,15 together with transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2),16 Furin17 and cathepsin L (CatL),18,19 mediates SARS-CoV-2 viral entry. In IAV-infected cells, we found that the mRNA levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, but not those of Furin and CatL, were increased by approximately threefold (A549 cells in Fig. 4a). An obvious switch in intracellular ACE2 expression was triggered at 12 h post-IAV infection (Fig. 4c). In addition, influenza NP, Mx1, and ISG54 increased accordingly, confirming successful IAV infection (Fig. 4b).Fig. 4: ACE2 is essential for IAV promotion of SARS-CoV-2 infection.a, b A549 cells were mock-infected or infected with WSN at an MOI of 0.1. At 12 h.p.i., total RNA was extracted from cells, and ACE2, TMPRSS2, Furin, and CatL mRNA levels (a) or NP, Mx1, and ISG54 mRNA levels (b) were evaluated via qRT-PCR using the SYBR green method. The data are expressed as fold changes relative to the mock infections. c A549 cells were infected with WSN at an MOI of 0.1. IAV NP protein (red) and ACE2 (green) were detected with an immunofluorescence assay at 12 h.p.i. Scale bars are shown. A549 (d), Calu-3 (e), and NHBE (f) cells were preinfected with WSN at an MOI of 0.1 for 12 h. Cells were then infected with live SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of 0.01 for another 48 h. Total RNA was extracted from cells, and ACE2 mRNA was evaluated via qRT-PCR using the SYBR green method. The protein expression levels of ACE2, SARS-CoV-2 N gene, IAV NP, and β-actin were measured via western blotting assay. * means increased exposure to visualize ACE2. (g) The relative mRNA levels of ACE2 were measured in lung homogenates from the indicated groups, and the protein expression of IAV NP and ACE2 was detected via western blotting. (d–g) The data are expressed as fold changes relative to the non-IAV infection control. (h–i) To establish ACE2 knockdown cells, A549 cells were transduced with lentivirus encoding the CRISPR-Cas9 system with two guide RNAs targeting ACE2 (sgRNA1 and sgRNA2) or control guide RNA. Cells were infected with live SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of 0.01 with or without IAV infection using the same procedure described above. The ACE2 (qRT-PCR) (h) and SARS-CoV-2 E gene (Taqman-qRT-PCR) (i) mRNA levels were detected. The data are expressed as the fold change relative to the non-IAV infection control. Values represent means ± SD of three independent experiments. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001.Full size imageInterestingly, ACE2 mRNA levels increased more dramatically in IAV and SARS-CoV-2 coinfection cells, with 28-fold increase in A549 cells (Fig. 4d), fivefold increase in Calu-3 cells (Fig. 4e), and sixfold increase in NHBE cells (Fig. 4f). The mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 4g) of ACE2 also increased accordingly in lung homogenates from coinfected mice. We further detected the expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2, Furin, and Cat L under infection of HRSV, HPIV, or HRV3, respectively. The data show these viruses (unable to promote SARS-CoV-2 infection) had no effects on the expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2, Furin, and Cat L (Supplementary information, Fig. S3).Fig. 5: Enhanced SARS-CoV-2 infection is independent of IFN signaling.A549 (a–c), Calu-3 (d–f), and Huh-7 (g–i) cells were pretreated with the indicated doses of IFNα for 12 h. Cells were then infected with pseudo-SARS-CoV-2 for another 24 h, followed by measurement of luciferase activity and the mRNA expression levels of the indicated genes. The mRNA levels are expressed as fold changes relative to nontreated cells. P values are from unpaired one-way ANOVA. j–l WT A549 and IFNAR IFNAR–/– A549 cells were infected with WSN at an MOI of 0.1 for 12 h, and cells were then infected with pseudo-SARS-CoV-2 for another 24 h, followed by measurement of luciferase activity and the mRNA expression levels of the indicated genes. m WT A549 and IFNAR–/– A549 cells were infected with WSN at an MOI of 0.1 for 12 h, and the cells were then infected with live SARS-CoV-2 for another 48 h, followed by measurement of mRNA levels for SARS-CoV-2 E gene (Taqman-qRT-PCR). The data are expressed as fold changes relative to the nontreatment (b, c, e, f, h, i) or mock infection (k, l) or non-IAV infection (m) controls. Values represent means ± SD of three independent experiments. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001.Full size imageWhen cells were transduced by lentivirus encoding ACE2-sgRNA(small-guide RNA) to knockdown ACE2 expression (Fig. 4h), the IAV-mediated enhancement of SARS-CoV-2 infection was completely abolished (Fig. 4i).These data indicate that IAV permitted increased SARS-CoV-2 infection mainly through upregulation of ACE2 expression.Enhanced SARS-CoV-2 infectivity is independent of interferon signalingACE2 has been reported to be an interferon (IFN)-stimulated gene (ISG) in human airway epithelial cells.20 IAV infection also stimulates type I IFN signaling. Therefore, we tested whether the augmentation of ACE2 expression is dependent on IFN. For this, cells were first pretreated with different doses of IFNα (Fig. 5) and IFNγ (Supplementary information, Fig. S4a–c) and then infected with pseudo-SARS-CoV-2. The data show that IFNα did not promote pseudo-SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in A549 cells (Fig. 5a) but rather significantly inhibited pseudo-SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in Calu-3 (Fig. 5d) and Huh-7 (Fig. 5g) cells. Compared with the mRNA levels of ISG54 (Fig. 5b, e, h), the mRNA levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were only mildly increased by approximately 1- to 3-fold under IFN treatment (Fig. 5c, f, i). These data indicate that ACE2 could not robustly respond to IFN in these cells, which in turn suggest that ACE2-mediated viral entry was not affected by exogenous IFN.Moreover, in IFNAR–/– A549 cells, the enhanced infectivity of pseudo-SARS-CoV-2 under IAV coinfection was intact (Fig. 5j). In contrast to the decreased levels of ISG54 in IFNAR–/– A549 cells (Fig. 5k; Supplementary information Fig. S4d), the mRNA levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 still increased in IFNAR–/– A549 cells under IAV infection (Fig. 5l). Furthermore, in IFNAR–/– A549 cells, the infectivity of live SARS-CoV-2 under IAV coinfection was again enhanced (Fig. 5m). These results strongly suggest that SARS-CoV-2 responded to IAV infection rather than endogenous IFN signaling for favorable viral infection.DiscussionRecently, there have been many discussions about the possible impacts of the upcoming flu season on the current COVID-19 pandemic. Speculations have been made that IAV infection could induce more severe disease due to secondary SARS-CoV-2 infection or that coinfection with these two viruses causes more serious illness. However, no experimental data are yet available to show the relationship between IAV and SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we provide the first experimental evidence that IAV preinfection strongly promotes SARS-CoV-2 virus entry and infectivity in cells and animals. These data emphasize that influenza prevention during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic season is of great importance.Coinfection of viruses frequently occurs in nature. Some studies have shown a positive interaction between dengue virus and Zika virus via antibody-dependent enhancement.21 Other studies have shown negative interactions between the common cold virus and SARS-CoV-2 via pre-existing immunity.22 Through coinfection with IAV and pseudotyped or live SARS-CoV-2, we observed a great enhancement in SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in both cell culture and mice. This enhancement was associated with an increased expression level of ACE2, which is a major receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells. We detected a 2- to 3-fold increase in ACE2 mRNA levels post-IAV infection (A549 cells). However, a much higher increase (28-fold) in the ACE2 mRNA level was detected after IAV and SARS-CoV-2 coinfection. We suspect that IAV infection induced mild expression of ACE2, permitting SARS-CoV-2 virus entry, and then, the subsequent multiplication of SARS-CoV-2 further enhanced ACE2 expression in a positive feedback pattern.20 In K18-hACE2 mice, coinfection increased ACE2 expression by 6.5-fold under the airway epithelium-expressing human K18 promoter (less than that in A549 cells (28-fold) under the native hACE2 promoter). The lower induction fold of ACE2 in K18-hACE2 mice probably due to regulations at only post-transcriptional and translational levels because IAV and SARS-CoV-2 coinfection has no effects on hK18 promoter (data not shown). Nevertheless, Fig. 4i showed that the IAV-mediated enhancement of SARS-CoV-2 infection was completely abolished when ACE2 was knocked down, which again indicated that ACE2 is a major reason for SARS-CoV-2 enhancement although other factors may also play a role. The detailed mechanism still needs further studies.Intriguingly, among the viruses tested, only IAV, but not HRSV, HPIV, HRV3, enhanced SARS-CoV-2 infection. The three viruses HRSV, HPIV, and HRV3 are prevalent pathogens that cause the common cold in humans, but these viruses had no effects on SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. Furthermore, we confirmed the universal effects of IAV through comparison of those of natural H1N1 and H3N2 isolates (Supplementary information, Fig. S5a), and also the influenza B virus (data not shown). In addition, the infectivity of the current D614G mutant SARS-CoV-2 can also be stimulated by IAV preinfection (Supplementary information, Fig. S5b). The unique ability of IAV to augment SARS-CoV-2 infectivity indicates that the influenza virus is a key pathogen requiring prevention and control during the current coronavirus pandemic.As our data showed that IAV could still promote SARS-CoV-2 infection in IFNAR–/– A549 cells (Fig. 5j, m), it suggests that endogenous IFN induced by IAV infection is not enough to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection. On the contrary, both our data with pseudo-SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 5d, g) and others’ data with either pseudo23 or live SARS-CoV-224,25 proved that exogenous IFN could strongly inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection at least in cell cultures (probably through antiviral actions of numerous ISGs including IFMITs23). Thus, we should distinguish the roles of endogenous and exogenous IFN in the coinfection model. Interestingly, the coinfection of IAV and SARS-CoV-2 mostly occurred in the same infected A549 cells (Supplementary information, Fig. S1b), further supporting that endogenous IFN plays limited roles in coinfection as it must act on the adjacent non-infected cells.We further tested whether the expression of IAV gene segments alone could stimulate SARS-CoV-2 infection. The data in Supplementary information, Fig. S5c and S5d shows that segment-2 encoding PB1 showed the greatest promotive effect on SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and ACE2 expression. The detailed molecular mechanism underlying PB1-mediated SARS-CoV-2 enhancement needs further study. Nevertheless, the IAV segment-2 encodes two other viral proteins, PB1-F2, and PB1-N40, to modulate host cells.26 PB1-F2 is a pro-apoptotic factor and can regulate innate immunity.27 PB1-N40 interacts with many host factors and contributes to viral pathogenicity.28 Overall, the fact that the IAV segment might promote SARS-CoV-2 infection further confirms a unique positive interaction between IAV and SARS-CoV-2.Importantly, the enhancement phenotype in IAV and SARS-CoV-2 coinfection was independent of IFN signaling and was not observed when cells were coinfected with inactivated IAV (data not shown). Therefore, influenza vaccination (especially inactivated influenza vaccine) to inhibit influenza infection should be recommended to people with a high risk of coinfection. Our findings also remind that surveillance of coinfection is encouraged in the coming winter. Moreover, social distancing and mask-wearing are beneficial to protect people from the transmission of either or both viruses.Materials and methodsCells and virusesThe 293 T, A549, Huh-7, MDCK, Vero E6, WI-38, WI-38 VA-13, and BEAS-2B cells were obtained from ATCC and maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM; Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS).

The eight WSN viral segments in the pHW2000 plasmid were kindly provided by Professor Hans Klenk, Marburg University. The DNA transfection reagent Fugene HD was purchased from Promega, and the transfection was performed according to manuscript procedures.Pseudotype virus productionPseudotyped VSV-ΔG viruses expressing either a luciferase reporter or mCherry reporter were provided by Professor Ningshao Xia, Xiamen University. To produce pseudotyped VSV-ΔG-Luc/mCherry bearing SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (pseudo-SARS-CoV-2), Vero E6 cells were seeded in 10-cm dishes and transfected simultaneously with 15 μg SARS-CoV-2-S-Δ18 plasmid using Lipofectamine 3000 (Thermo). Forty-eight hours posttransfection, 150 µL pseudotyped VSV-ΔG bearing VSV-G protein was used to infect Vero E6 cells. Cell supernatants were collected after another 24 h, clearing of cell debris by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 6 min, aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C.Luciferase-based cell entry assayTarget cells were seeded in 48-well plates and inoculated in triplicate with equivalent volumes of pseudotyped virus stocks at a 1:5 dilution in DMEM (3% FBS) with or without IAV preinfection. At 24 h post-pseudotype infection, luciferase activities were measured with a Luciferase Assay System (Promega E4550).Virus infection and IFN treatmentFor IAV infection, cells were washed with PBS and then incubated with viruses at different MOIs (from 0.01 to 1) in infection medium (DMEM, supplemented with 2% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin) at 37 °C in 5% CO2.For SARS-CoV-2 infection, cells were incubated with SARS-CoV-2 live virus at an MOI of 0.01 in infection medium (DMEM, 1% penicillin/streptomycin) and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 1 h with or without 12 h IAV preinfection (MOI 0.1). Cells were then washed with PBS two times and incubated in culture medium (DMEM, supplemented with 5% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin) at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 48 h.For HRV3, HPIV or HRSV infection, cells were washed with PBS and then incubated with the indicated viruses in infection medium (DMEM, supplemented with 3% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin) and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 12 h.For IFN treatment, recombinant human IFNα2a (Beyotime, P5646) and IFNγ (Beyotime, P5664) were dissolved in 0.1% BSA, diluted in DMEM with 10% FBS, and then incubated with cells for 12 h at the indicated doses.Real-time reverse-transcriptase–polymerase chain reactionThe mRNA levels of the indicated genes were quantified via quantitative PCR with reverse transcription (qRT-PCR). Purified RNAs extracted with TRIzol (Invitrogen™,15596018) were subjected to reverse transcription using oligo dT or random primer (using Takara cat#RR037A Kit), and then, the corresponding cDNAs were quantified using Hieff qPCR SYBR Green Master Mix (Yeason). Thermal cycling was performed in a 384-well reaction plate (ThermoFisher, 4343814). Quantification of IAV replication was measured by SYBR Green qRT-PCR with primers targeting NP vRNA, and the IAV expression was measured by SYBR Green qRT-PCR with primers targeting NP mRNA. Quantification of the propagation for other respiratory viruses was measured by SYBR Green qRT-PCR with primers targeting the HRSV M gene, the HPIV M gene, and the HRV3 5′UTR (position 456–569), respectively. Host receptor and cofactor genes were measured using gene-specific primers (Supplementary information, Table S1). All mRNA levels were normalized to the β-actin level in the same cell.The relative number of SARS-CoV-2 viral genome copies was determined using a TaqMan RT-PCR Kit (Yeason). To accurately quantify the absolute number of SARS-CoV-2 genomes, a standard curve was prepared by measuring the SARS-CoV-2 N gene constructed in the pCMV-N plasmid. All SARS-CoV-2 genome copy numbers were normalized to GAPDH expression in the same cell.All the primers and Tagman probes used in this study were listed in Supplementary information, Table S1.Western blot analysisFor western blot analysis, cells were lysed in RIPA buffer on ice for 30 min, separated via sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and subjected to western blot analysis. For mouse experiments, half of the lung tissue from each mouse was homogenized in PBS, followed by boiling in SDS lysis buffer (GE) at 100 °C for 30 min. Rabbit monoclonal antibody against ACE2 (Abclonal, A4612, 1:1000), mouse monoclonal antibody against SARS-CoV Nucleoprotein (Sino Biological, 40143-MM05, 1:1000), and anti-actin antibody (Abclonal, 1:1000) were purchased commercially. The anti-influenza virus-NP antibody was kindly provided by Professor Ningshao Xia. Peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Antgene, 1: 5000) were applied accordingly, followed by image development with a Chemiluminescent HRP Substrate Kit (Millipore Corporation).ImmunofluorescenceA549 cells were fixed and incubated with primary antibodies. The primary antibodies used in this study were rabbit polyclonal antibody against ACE2 for immunofluorescence (Sino Biological, 10108-T26) and anti-influenza virus-NP antibody (kindly provided by Professor Ningshao Xia). Alexa Fluor dye-conjugated secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor R488, Invitrogen; Alexa Fluor M555, Invitrogen) and DAPI (Beyotime, C1002) were administered afterward according to standard protocols. Cell imaging was performed on a Leica TCS SP8 confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica).ACE2 knockdown cellsTwo sgRNAs targeting the hACE2 gene were designed under the protocol in http://chopchop.cbu.uib.no (sgRNA sequence of ACE2 were shown in Supplementary information, Table S1) and commercially synthesized to clone into the lenti-Cas9-blast vector (kindly provided by Professor Hongbing Shu). The control sgRNA lentivirus construct was also provided by Professor Hongbing Shu. In brief, A549 cells were plated in 6-well plates and transduced with lentivirus encoding the CRISPR-Cas9 system, including either ACE2 sgRNA or control sgRNA. The cell mixtures were selected with blasticidin for one week to obtain ACE2 knockdown cells. The gene knockdown efficiencies were confirmed by measuring the ACE2 mRNA level through qRT-PCR analysis.MiceK18-hACE2 transgenic mice, which express human ACE2 driven by the human epithelial cell cytokeratin-18 (K18) promoter used as an infection model for both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2,30,31,32 were purchased from Gempharmatech and housed in ABSL-3 pathogen-free facilities under 12-h light-dark cycles with access to food and water. All animal experiments were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Wuhan University. Mice were male, age-matched, and grouped for SARS-CoV-2 infection or IAV and SARS-CoV-2 coinfection. On day 0, mice were intranasally infected with PBS or 2000 PFU of WSN, and then, both groups were intranasally infected with 3 × 105 PFU of SARS-CoV-2 on day 2. Another two days later, mice were sacrificed to determine viral loads and for histological assays.Histology analysisLung tissue from infected mice was dissected on day 2 post-SARS-CoV-2 infection, fixed, and stained using a standard Hematoxylin-Eosin staining (H&E) staining procedure. The slides were scanned and analyzed by the Wuhan Sci-Meds company. Representative images from three mice in each group are shown.Statistical analysisIf not indicated otherwise, Student’s t-test was used for two-group comparisons. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, and ****P < 0.0001 were considered significant. Unless otherwise noted, error bars indicate mean values and standard deviations of at least three biological experiments. ReferencesHuang, C. et al.

This paper presents the results of the study of protection of the vaccine using on guinea pigs, including various options of administering, dose and frequency. Provided data of the novel vaccine candidate will contribute to its further movement into the preclinical stage study.MethodsGeneral states of guinea pigs was assessed based on behavior and dynamics of a guinea pig weight-gain test. The effectiveness of the new anti-brucellosis vector vaccine was determined by studying its protective effect after conjunctival, intranasal and sublingual administration in doses 105 EID50, 106 EID50 and 107 EID50 during prime and boost vaccinations of animals, followed by challenge with a virulent strain of B. melitensis 16 M infection. For sake of comparison, the commercial B. melitensis Rev.1 vaccine was used as a control. The protective properties of vaccines were assessed by quantitation of Brucella colonization in organs and tissues of infected animals and compared to the control groups.ResultsIt was observed a gradual increase in body weight of guinea pigs after prime and booster immunization with the vaccine using conjunctival, intranasal and sublingual routes of administration, as well as after using various doses of vaccine. The most optimal way of using the vaccine has been established: double intranasal immunization of guinea pigs at a dose of 106 EID50, which provides 80% protection of guinea pigs from B. melitensis 16 M infection (P < 0.05), which is comparable to the results of the effectiveness of the commercial B. melitensis Rev.1 vaccine.ConclusionsWe developed effective human vaccine candidate against brucellosis and developed its immunization protocol in guinea pig model. We believe that because of these studies, the proposed vaccine has achieved the best level of protection, which in turn provides a basis for its further promotion. BackgroundBrucellosis is a chronic infectious disease of humans and animals, which is included in the list of quarantine diseases as a social threat factor. There are ten known species of the causative agent of brucellosis, which includes those that pose a threat to human health—Brucella melitensis, B. abortus, B. suis and B. canis [1, 2]. B. melitensis that causes the most severe and acute form of infection is responsible for 80–90% of human brucellosis cases [3]. Most cases of brucellosis in humans are the results of occupational exposure to the bacteria and consumption of infected dairy products [4].Despite the fact that brucellosis is amenable to antibiotic therapy, it seriously weakens the human body and many patients require long-term recovery. In addition, due to the intracellular tropism of Brucella, only a very limited number of antibiotics can be used to treat this infection [5]. It is important to note that in 5–40% of cases the antibiotic therapy results in relapses of the disease, which requires protracted treatment using different combinations of antibiotics [6]. This fact, as well as the lack of a licensed anti-brucellosis vaccine for humans represent a serious problem for the brucellosis endemic areas.Earlier, USSR and China were widely using live attenuated vaccines based on B. abortus 19 BA or B. melitensis 104 M strains for human vaccination [7]. Normally, in vaccinated people, these vaccines ensured a short-term immune response and were also accompanied by high reactogenicity and hypersensitivity, especially when repeated doses of the vaccine were administered.One of the most important strategies in the development of safe and effective anti-brucellosis vaccines is the use of live genetically modified vectors—non-pathogenic microorganisms (bacteria and viruses) that produce brucellosis antigens. Nowadays, Lactococcus Lactis [8], Escherichia coli [9], Salmonela enterica [10] and Semliki Forest virus (SFV) [11] are used as vectors for the expression of brucellosis proteins in vivo. It has been proved experimentally that the tested bacterial (intracellular) and viral vectors are capable of infecting a wide range of cell types and expressing brucellosis antigens within the infected cell.Previously, we used recombinant Influenza A viral vectors of both subtypes a H5N1 for prime vaccination and H1N1 for booster vaccination that express brucellosis immunodominant outer membrane proteins (Omp) 16 and ribosomal L7/L12 in order to develop a new Brucella abortus vaccine (Flu-BA) against brucellosis in cattle [12, 13]. Now, the Flu-BA vaccine is registered in Kazakhstan (registration certificate #RK-VP-1-3775-19 dated from January 14, 2019) and is at the stage of commercialization for vaccination of cattle against B. abortus infection.The effectiveness of cattle vaccination is comparable to the results of using the commercial B. abortus S19 vaccine. The use of influenza viral vectors (IVV) subtype H5N1 may serve as an additional factor in increasing the effectiveness of the vaccine for humans. The fact is that there is no pre-existing immunity to influenza virus H5N1 in human population. Therefore, IVV of the H5N1 subtype has more opportunities for replication and expression of brucellosis proteins.In this study, we used the entire existing stocks of previously obtained recombinant IVV type A of subtype H5N1 that express Brucella Omp 16 and 19, ribosomal L7/L12 or Cu–Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD) from the open reading frame of the NS1 gene at amino acid position 80 [14].Brucella antigens Omp 16 and 19, L7/L12 and SOD induce a pronounced cellular response which is necessary for protection against brucellosis infection [15,16,17]. It should be noted that the proteins expressed by IVV are immunodominant and common (genetically similar by 95–99%) for B. melitensis, B. abortus, B. suis, and B. canis [18,19,20]. In this regard, we have developed an anti-brucellosis tetravalent IVV based human vaccine candidate expressing the brucellosis proteins Omp16, L7/L12, Omp19 and SOD.This article presents the results of studying clinical observation of general states of guinea pigs and protectiveness of the anti-brucellosis human vaccine with different modes of administration, with different doses and frequencies of vaccination in guinea pigs.MethodsGeneration of viral constructs and preparation of vaccine samplesInfluenza viruses were obtained by a standard reverse genetics method using eight bi-directional plasmids pHW2000. In this study, we used IVV type A of H5N1 subtype that express Brucella proteins Omp16, Omp19, L7/L12 or SOD from NS1 open reading frames at amino acid position 80. A detailed procedure for the construction of the IVV has been described previously [14]. Schematic picture for IVV is presented in Fig. 1. Obtained recombinant influenza vectors (Flu-NS1-80-Omp16, Flu-NS1-80-L7/L12, Flu-NS1-80-Omp19, Flu-NS1-80-Cu–Zn SOD) were then used to produce vaccine for immunization guinea pigs. Briefly, the viral vector was accumulated in ten-day old chicken embryos (CE) at 34 °C for 48 h. The IVV titer was determined by hemagglutination assay based on the generally accepted method as reported previously [21].Fig. 1Schematic representation of the recombinant influenza viral vector construction destined to generate a vaccine against brucellosis. a Full size NS1 protein virulence factor for antagonizing interferon system and b deletion part of NS1 replaced by Brucella immunodominant proteins NS1-Omp 16, NS1-Omp 19, NS1-L7/L12 and NS1-Cu–Zn SOD.

The scheme is not drawn according to scaleFull size imageAllantoic suspensions of IVV were clarified, purified and concentrated by ultracentrifugation and then the resulting material was sent to diafiltration and sterilizing filtration and then combined with a sterile stabilizing medium containing 12% soy peptone (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and 6% sucrose (Sigma-Aldrich, USA). The combined material was added to 1 ml ampoule, lyophilized and stored at 2–8 °C. The lyophilized vaccine was resuspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) prior to vaccination of the animals.Bacterial strainsThe virulent B. melitensis 16 M strain was obtained from the collection of microorganisms of the Research Institute for Biological Safety Problems (RIBSP). Bacterial cells were cultured under aerobic conditions on a Brucella Agar Base nutrient medium (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) at 37 °C. All experiments with live Brucella cells were conducted in Biosafety level 3 facility (BSL-3) at the RIBSP. Infected animals were contained in specialized animal BSL-3 facility.Bioethics and groups of experimental animalsThe studies were conducted in accordance with national and international regulations and guidelines for the handling and use of laboratory animals. The study protocol was approved by the RIBSP Bioethics Committee (Protocol no. 0418/04). The animals contained in cages on 12 light/12 dark cycle and were fed ad libitum with standard rodent diet and had no water restrictions. Animals from control and experimental groups were kept isolated from each other throughout the whole experiment. This study used conventional bred female guinea pigs weighing 250–330 g (National Center for Expertise of Drugs, Medical Products and Equipment, Kazakhstan).Immunization of guinea pigsTo determine the method of applying the vaccine, five groups (n = 5 animals per group) were formed, that is, three experimental and two control groups. The experimental groups were administered with vaccine conjunctivally (c.) in a volume of 100 μl (50 μl in each eye) or intranasally (i.n.) in a volume of 200 μl (100 μl in each nasal cavity) or sublingually (s.l.) in a volume of 200 μl. The infectious titer of the IVV in the experimental vaccine samples was 6.14–6.75 log10 EID50/animal. On day 21 after the prime vaccination, guinea pigs were boosted according to the immunization protocol. The animals in negative control group were injected subcutaneously (s.c.) with 200 μl of PBS. In the positive control group, a dose of 105 CFU/animal commercial B. melitensis Rev.1 vaccine (Antigen LLP, Kazakhstan) was injected once s.c..Further on, to determine the protective dose and the frequency of immunization, the vaccine was administered i.n. Three doses of the vaccine—105 EID50, 106 EID50 and 107 EID50 were evaluated in six experimental groups of guinea pigs (n = 5 animals per group), including control groups, after prime-boost immunization according to the protocol presented above.In order to assess weight changes associated with the vaccine, immunized guinea pigs were clinically monitored with weekly weighing for 42 days upon both prime and boost vaccinations. The clinical assessment was evaluated based on parameters including the survival rate, general condition, behavior and dynamics of animals’ weight.Assessment protectiveness of the vaccineOn the day 21 after the boost immunization, the guinea pigs (45 animals in total) from the vaccinated and control groups were s.c. infected with a virulent strain of B. melitensis 16 M infection at a dose of 20 CFU/animal. Guinea pigs from positive (n = 10) control groups were infected in a similar way on day 42 after a single vaccination with B. melitensis Rev.1. Thirty days after infection, all guinea pigs were euthanized with CO2 and lymph nodes (retropharyngeal, lower cervical and right and left inguinal), liver, spleen and bone marrow were extracted aseptically. Bacteriological examination and evaluation of the results were carried out according to the previously described method [23]. Briefly, after tenfold serial dilution the tissue homogenates in 0.1% Triton X-100-PBS solution were inoculated into plates with Brucella Base Agar (HiMedia, India) and incubated at 37 °C for two weeks with periodical counting of the bacterial colonies during this period.The concentration of bacteria (colony forming units (CFU)/g per tissue) in tissue samples was determined by standard colony counting. An animal was considered infected if a Brucella colony was found in culture of one or more organs. The results of the bacteriological study were assessed according to several parameters: (a) vaccination efficacy or the number of animals (expressed in %) from which no Brucella colonies were isolated in any animal samples; (b) generalization of the infectious process or the index of infection (the number of organs and lymph nodes of animals from which Brucella was isolated and which is represented in the arithmetic mean); (c) the intensity/severity of the infectious process or the degree of Brucella colonization of organs and lymph nodes (LN) expressed in log10 CFU/g of tissue.Statistical analysisThe index of infection and Brucella colonization in tissues between groups were analyzed with one- way or two-way ANOVA followed by multiple comparisons of the Turkey test, Sidak or Dunnett’s tests. The variance in protective efficacy of animal groups was compared by one-sided Fisher exact test. P < 0.05 was considered significant. Means are reported with standard errors (SEM). Statistical analysis of all experimental data was performed using Graph Pad Prizm Software Version 8.0 (Graph Pad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA). The experiments have been repeated, and the results were reproducible.ResultsAssessing general states of the guinea pigs after vaccinationThe effect of the vaccine on guinea pigs was evaluated with different ways of administering, with different doses and frequencies of the use of vaccine in comparison with a negative (PBS) control group.It was found that the vaccine was safe in guinea pigs in different ways of vaccine administering—c., i.n. and s.l., as well as in various doses in primary and secondary immunization (prime and boost). There were no animal deaths or signs of disease by the end of the observation period. In general, the condition of the animals, both in the control and in the experimental groups, was satisfactory in terms of physical activity, appetite and general health condition.Evaluation of changes in animal body weight within 21 days after prime-boost immunization showed that the weight of animals (on average) increased in all test groups (Fig. 2) by 45–58% and amounted to 158–175 g which was comparable to the control group—55% and 162 g.Fig. 2Dynamics of body weight change of guinea pigs on day 42 after prime-boost immunization. Animals were immunized with vaccine candidate against human brucellosis at different routes of immunization (a) and various doses (b). Statistical analysis was performed with two-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test showed that during 42-day body weight measurement between the PBS control and vaccinated groups were not significant. P < 0.05 values were considered significantFull size imageNo group was differed significantly in mean of animal weight from the negative (PBS) control group.Protectiveness of viral vector based vaccine candidate at different ways of its administration against B. melitensis 16 M infectionThe protective efficacy of the vaccine candidate was evaluated in guinea pigs using c., i.n. and s.l. routes of administration and compared with reference B. melitensis Rev.1 vaccine or PBS control groups.The protective efficacy of the vaccine was assessed by parameters as the index of infection, the efficacy of vaccination and the number of bacteria of the virulent strain of B. melitensis 16 M obtained from organs and tissues of vaccinated and unvaccinated animals.The results of the bacteriological study showed that with various mucosal routs of immunization, the new anti-brucellosis vaccine candidate provided protection at a level of 1.64 to 2.30 log10 units. In comparison with the unvaccinated control group (PBS), all vaccine samples, regardless of the route of administration, ensured protection of guinea pigs from B. melitensis 16 M infection (α = 0.0001–0.02) (Table 1).Table 1 Degree of protective efficacy of the vaccines by different routes of administration in guinea pigsFull size tableSignificant protection of the vaccine was observed after i.n. administration (2.8 log10), whereas for s.l. immunization, the unit of protection was 1.64 log10. In case when the vaccine administered by c. route the unit of its protection was 2.3 log10, which was comparable to the commercial B. melitensis Rev.1 vaccine results.According to the index of infection (Fig. 3b), significant protection compared to the control group (PBS) was achieved in the groups vaccinated c. (P < 0.01; vaccination efficiency 60%) and i.n. (P < 0.002, vaccination efficiency 80%), as well as in animals vaccinated with B. melitensis Rev.1 (P < 0.005; vaccination efficiency 80%). It should be noted that the index of infection in i.n. vaccinated animals was similar (P > 0.99) to the index in animals immunized with the commercial B. melitensis Rev.1 vaccine.Fig. 3Protective efficacy of the vaccines in guinea pigs when administered by different routes. Protective efficacy of vaccines as evaluated by the effectiveness of vaccination (a), index of infection (b) and isolation rate of Brucella (c) from the tissues of control and experimental groups of guinea pigs on day 30 after challenging with the virulent strain of B. melitensis 16 M. Animals were vaccinated with the vector vaccine by prime-boost conjunctival (c.), intranasal (i.n.), sublingual (s.l.) at interval of 21 days, and with B. melitensis Rev.1 by single subcutaneous (s.c.) vaccination. Guinea pigs in negative control group were injected with PBS. The challenge of animals was performed with B. melitensis 16 M at a dose of 20 CFU/animal using s.c. route. Bacteriological evaluation was assessed by the index of infection in animals (the arithmetic mean ± standard error was given for each group; the number of organs and lymph nodes from which Brucella was isolated for each animal) and by counting Brucella colonies in tissues, where data is expressed as log10 CFU/g. Statistical difference between groups was indicated with asterisks and statistical analysis for (B) was performed using a one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett's multiple comparisons test and (*, P < 0.01; **, P < 0.002) and for c two-way ANOVA, Tukey’s multiple comparisons test (*P = 0.04–0.01; **P = 0.009–0.001; ***P = 0.0004–0.0002, ****P < 0.0001)Full size imageBased on the results of these studies, the i.n. route of vaccine administration was applied for further research in order to determine the optimal dose for immunization.Study of protective efficacy of a novel vaccine candidate at different doses and after infection with B. melitensis In this study, the protectiveness of the vaccine was assessed at various doses of i.n. vaccine administration after prime-boost immunization, as well as after challenge of guinea pigs with the virulent B. melitensis 16 M strain.The evaluation of the protective efficacy of the tetravalent vector brucellosis vaccine against the infection was carried out according to the following parameters (1) determination of the effectiveness of vaccination (the degree of complete protection against infection, expressed in percent), (2) study of the infection index, as well as by counting Brucella colonies in the tissues and lymph nodes of guinea pigs 30 days after infection.Bacteriological studies of the organs and lymph nodes of infected animals showed that the tested doses of the recombinant vector vaccine, as well as the commercial vaccine, provided significant protection (P < 0.04 versus the unvaccinated group) of guinea pigs against B. melitensis 16 M infection ranging from 1.64 to 2.8 log10 units. Our results showed that the highest level of protection (vaccination efficiency) against infection in guinea pigs was in the groups immunized at doses of 106 EID50 and 107 EID50 (80%) compared with the control group (PBS) after the challenge, in which the infection rate was 100% and these data were statistically significant (P < 0.04). It should be noted that in the group vaccinated with B. melitensis Rev.1 the vaccination efficiency was also 80% (Table 2).Table 2 Rates of protection in guinea pigs after challenge with the virulent strain B. melitensis 16 MFull size tableAccording to the index of infection (Fig. 4d), a significant level of protection in comparison with the control group (level of infection: 100%) was achieved in all three tested doses and only after secondary boost vaccination (P < 0.0004, P < 0.02). The index of infection in the groups of animals immunized with a dose of vaccine 106 EID50 and B. melitensis Rev.1 vaccine was comparable with each other and these groups differed significantly compared to the negative control group P = 0.003–0.001.Fig. 4Protectiveness of vaccine samples at different doses in guinea pigs. a–c Colonization of B. melitensis in organs and tissues of prime-boost vaccinated guinea pigs and c index of Brucella infection upon challenge with B. melitensis 16 M. Guinea pigs were immunized twice i.n. 21 days apart with a new vaccine candidate at dose 105 EID50, 106 EID50 and 107 EID50 or a single delivery of commercial vaccine B. melitensis Rev.1. via s.c. immunization. Guinea pigs of positive control groups were injected with PBS. Animals challenged with virulent strain of B. melitensis 16 M at a dose of 20 CFU/animal using s.c. route. Bacteriological evaluation was assessed by counting Brucella colonies in tissues, where data is expressed as log10 CFU/g and the index of infection of infected animals and compared to the control groups (the arithmetic mean ± standard error was given for each group; number of tissues from where Brucella was isolated for each animal). Statistical analysis for (A-C) was performed using a one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett's multiple comparisons test and for (D) using two-way ANOVA, Tukey’s multiple comparisons testFull size imageIt should be noted that the values of the index of infection between the B. melitensis Rev.1 group and the experimental groups did not have significance (P > 0.05).DiscussionTo our knowledge, this study is the first trial conducted in guinea pigs to evaluate the protective properties of a new candidate for vector vaccine against human brucellosis. This phase in vaccine trials is an important step in making an experimental vaccine a promising candidate for further human clinical trials to determine its effectiveness. In this study, double i.n. immunization with a vector vaccine based on influenza viral vectors expressing the immunodominant brucellosis proteins Omp16, L7/L12, Omp19 and Cu–Zn SOD at a dose of 106 EID50 ensured protection against B. melitensis 16 M infection comparable to the effect of commercial B. melitensis Rev.1 vaccine.The choice of guinea pigs as model animals for evaluation of body gain changes and vaccine candidate protection was determined by their natural resistance to influenza infection in comparison with laboratory mice. In this case, the use of a more resistant model animal seemed to be a key condition in the study of protection, since, in the long run, the vaccine is designed for humans.The previous success of using IVV in the development of the anti-brucellosis vaccine Flu-BA for cattle [12], which is now at the stage of commercialization in Kazakhstan, served as the basis for this study. The idea of developing an anti-brucellosis human vaccine is that the high efficacy of the vaccine is achieved in cattle which naturally resistant to influenza infection (i.e., as a non-replicable viral vector), and, in our opinion, should be even more pronounced in humans. This assumption is based on the fact that humans are a natural host for the influenza virus (Influenza A), including the influenza viral vectors we use.It should be noted that we used an influenza viral vector (IVV) of the H5N1 subtype, because there is no immune background to this type of pathogen [22] in the human population and IVV of the H5N1 subtype has a greater potential as a vaccine vector.We began the process of creating an effective anti-brucellosis vector vaccine for humans with the formation of requirements for the developed product, production technology and methods of its application and testing in healthcare practice. To this end, we have accumulated the existing experience in the development of vector vaccines for public health, have chosen the most generally accepted requirements for such vaccines and their manufacturing technologies, the method and frequency of their use and have developed criteria for assessing the effectiveness and safety of vaccine candidates.An analysis of the compliance of the developed vaccine with the above requirements (which are more general in nature than specific) showed that the viral vectors we selected, as well as the method for preparing and using the vaccine, correspond to them. In particular, we use non-pathogenic influenza viral vectors, the general safety of which has been confirmed by studies on guinea pigs with various ways of administering and dose of immunization.In order to obtain influenza viral vectors (IVV), we used A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) with a length-modified NS1-80 gene encoding 80 amino acids in the N-terminal region of the protein as the initial strain. The surface genes of hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) were taken from A/chicken/Astana/6/05 strains (H5N1, with the HA cleavage site preliminary removed). The safety or attenuation of IVV is ensured by the truncated NS1 protein (interferon antagonist), which results in their limited replicative capabilities (they make one cycle of reproduction in the cell and do not leave it) [14]. It is known that the degree of IVV attenuation is directly dependent on the length of the NS1 protein [23]. We have an IVV with NS1 length in 80 amino acid. NS1-124 was used to create a veterinary brucellosis vaccine as it for use in cattle a more aggressive IVV was required. As for humans, far preferable may be IVV with NS1-80. With IVV subtype H5N1 (a pathogenic variety of influenza virus), the attenuation was additionally achieved by removing the proteolytic cleavage site in the HA protein, that is, double attenuation was performed. During repeated re-inoculation in chick embryos, IVV retained all their basic biological properties, including signs of attenuation, and did not lose the brucellosis insertion segment [14], which indicates their genetic stability. In addition, the influenza viral vectors we use are RNA-containing viruses that are limited to cytoplasmic replication, thus eliminating the risk of integration and long-term persistence.The next important phase of our research was devoted to the study of the general safety control of the vaccine candidate at the early stage with different ways of administration and dose of use in guinea pigs. The vaccine has been found to be safe for guinea pigs when administered c., i.n. and s.l. The experimental animals did not show death or signs of any disease; by the end of observation (on day 14 after the prime-boost vaccinations), the body weight gain in guinea pigs was observed both after prime and after boost immunization. At the same time, the increase in body weight of guinea pigs in the experimental groups was comparable to the control group of animals that were injected with PBS. As a result of this work, the vaccine was recognized as a safe drug and was used in the future to assess its protectiveness depending on the immunization schedule.Further assessment of the effectiveness of the vaccine with different routes of administration to mucosal areas was determined using c., i.n. and s.l. methods of vaccine immunization in prime-boost mode. Since the influenza virus has a tropism for mucosal surfaces, it was assumed that the optimal way to administer a vaccine based on an influenza viral vector would be one of the tested mucosal routes. Since Brucella should be considered as a mucosal pathogen penetrating mucous surfaces, the “gates” of infection are the mucosal surfaces of the nose or mouth. Consequently, mucosal vaccination is capable to generate protective responses against pathogens at the site of the infection “gate” [24]. Our bacteriological study demonstrated that significant protection of guinea pigs after challenging with virulent strain of B. melitensis 16 M infection was achieved through i.n. administration of the vaccine in comparison with other methods of application.The next important step in our study was devoted to the choice of the vaccination dose and, at the same time, the frequency of vaccination, where the study of the protection and immunogenicity of the vaccine candidate was evaluated in animals by the ability to retain bacteria in organs and lymph nodes after animal infection with standard methods. Another distinctive feature of our studies was that the vaccine protection was assessed not only by the Brucella culture isolation from the tissues of vaccinated and unvaccinated animals, but also by such aspects as vaccination efficiency and infection index. It is believed that these indicators jointly provide a more complete and objective characterization of the vaccine protection. The new vaccine induced significant protection in response to B. melitensis 16 M infection within a range of 60–80% when administered i.n. in a double vaccination mode for all tested doses, and it was not inferior in efficiency to B. melitensis Rev.1, which is currently used in veterinary practice as the most immunogenic brucellosis vaccine. The level of protection of the B. melitensis Rev.1 vaccine obtained in our studies corresponds to the science literature data [25]. At the same time, it was found that the new vaccine candidate does not possess protection after primary vaccination, regardless of the dose. When choosing an immunizing dose of the vaccine, it is recommended to use a vaccination dose of 106 EID50, since the protection at the 106 EID50 dose (80% efficiency) was higher than 105 EID50 (60% efficiency) and similar to 107 EID50 (80% efficiency). The choice of an immunizing dose of 106 EID50 is determined by the reduction of possible adverse effect of vaccination and the cost of the production process of the vaccine. The vaccine is targeted at a specific risk group—laboratory scientists working with the pathogen, veterinarians, slaughterhouse workers and people involved in animal care industry. The next step in the further vaccine development will be devoted to the preclinical studies where will be evaluated the safety, immunogenicity and protectiveness of a new human vaccine candidate against brucellosis.ConclusionsThe results of the study in guinea pig models show that the recombinant vector anti-brucellosis vaccine candidate is a safe product with wide dose of application and mucosal immunization techniques and its protection properties in prime-boost immunization mode are comparable to that of the commercial B. melitensis Rev.1 vaccine against B. melitensis 16 M infection. We conclude the immunization schedule for our new candidate vaccine against human brucellosis—tetravalent vaccine formulation based on recombinant influenza A virus subtype H5N1 expressing Brucella Omp16, L7/L12, Omp19 and SOD in prime-boost intranasal immunization mode at immunization dose of 106 EID50. We could further use this recombinant vaccine vector for pre-clinical and clinical trials in humans.

Alternative to traditional epidemic surveillance, which often lags behind real time by weeks, big data from the Internet provide important information of the current epidemic trends. Here we present a methodology, ARGOX (Augmented Regression with GOogle data CROSS space), for accurate real-time tracking of state-level influenza epidemics in the United States. ARGOX combines Internet search data at the national, regional and state levels with traditional influenza surveillance data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and accounts for both the spatial correlation structure of state-level influenza activities and the evolution of people’s Internet search pattern. ARGOX achieves on average 28% error reduction over the best alternative for real-time state-level influenza estimation for 2014 to 2020. ARGOX is robust and reliable and can be potentially applied to track county- and city-level influenza activity and other infectious diseases.

Quick responses and preventive actions to changes in flu epidemics rely on timely and accurate information on the current flu severity. In particular, due to the geographically varying timing and intensity of disease epidemics, most public health decisions and executive orders for disease control and prevention are made at the state or local level. Accurate real-time flu tracking at the state/local level is thus indispensable. Traditional flu surveillance, such as those conducted by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), however, often lags behind real time by up to two weeks. Here we propose a statistically principled, self-coherent framework ARGOX (Augmented Regression with GOogle data CROSS space) for real-time, accurate flu estimation at the state level. ARGOX efficiently combines publicly available Internet search data with traditional flu surveillance data and coherently utilizes the data from multiple geographical resolutions (national, regional, and state levels).Figure 1State-by-state heatmap of relative Mean Squared Error of ARGOX, VAR, GFT, and Lu et al.21 to the naive method. The relative MSE is the ratio of the MSE of a given method to that of the naive method. Blue color means smaller MSE (i.e., better performance) than the naive method; red color means larger MSE (i.e., worse performance ) than the naive method; grey color means result not available. ARGOX with all blue colors uniformly dominates the naive method, while mixed colors in the rest of the plots show that VAR, GFT, and Lu et al.21 were worse than the naive method in a large proportion of states. ARGOX and VAR are evaluated for the whole period of Oct 11, 2014 to March 21, 2020; GFT is evaluated for the period of Oct 11, 2014 to August 15, 2015 due to GFT data availability; Lu et al.21 is evaluated from Oct 11, 2014 to May 14, 2017 due to its availability.The figure was generated by the programming language R. The US maps were drawn based on the publicly available R package urbnmapr, which uses map shapefiles from the US Census Bureau (https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-filesime-series/geoiger-line-file.html).Full size imageTable 1 Comparison of different methods for state-level %ILI estimation.Full size tableTable 2 Comparison of ARGOX to the method of Lu et al.21 for state-level %ILI estimation.Full size tableFor the last two decades, tracking of flu activities in the US mainly relies on traditional surveillance systems, such as the US Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet) by the CDC. Through the ILINet, thousands of healthcare providers across the US report their numbers of outpatients with Influenza-like Illness (ILI) to CDC on a weekly basis. CDC then aggregates the data and publishes the ILI percentages (%ILI, i.e., the percentages of outpatients with ILI) in its weekly reports at the national and regional levels (there are ten Health and Human Services (HHS) regions in the US, each consisting of multiple states). Starting from 2017, the state-level %ILI reports became available for selected states, and in late 2018 the state-level %ILI reports became available for all states except Florida. Owing to the time for administrative processing and aggregation, CDC’s flu reports typically lag behind real time for up to 2 weeks and are also subject to subsequent revisions. Such delay and inaccuracy are far from optimal for public health decision making, especially in the face of epidemic outbreaks or pandemics.Big data from the Internet offer the potential of real-time tracking of public health or social events. In fact, valuable insights have been gained from the Internet data about current social and economical status of a nation, including epidemic outbreaks2,3 and macro economic indices4,5. Furthermore, real-time data from the Internet could also offer insights at the regional, state, or local level. Examples include foreshadowing state-wise housing price index in the US6, estimating New York City flu activity7, estimating real-time county-level unreported COVID-19 severity in the US8 among others. For epidemic surveillance, such real-time digital data at local level can be potentially used to provide insights for early epidemic hot-spot detection and timely public health resource allocation (e.g. vaccine campaigns) as well as to gather information on the overall disease prevalence.Various models have been proposed to utilize Internet data, especially Internet search volume data, to provide real-time estimation of the current flu activity at the national level. Google Flu Trends (GFT), as one of the early examples, uses the search frequency of selected query terms from Google to estimate the real-time %ILI2. Recent models on combining CDC’s surveillance data with Internet-derived data appear to work well at the national level9,10. Other methods, primarily targeting national flu epidemics, were also developed based on traditional epidemiology data and mechanistic models, such as susceptible-infectious-recovered-susceptible model with ensemble adjustment Kalman filter (SIRS-EAKF)7,11,12,13,14.Compared to estimation at the national level, %ILI estimation at the regional or state level is much more challenging, as documented by FluSight, the CDC-sponsored Flu Prediction Initiative15. Due to factors like geographical proximity, transportation connectivity, and public health communication, the state-wise epidemic spread exhibits strong spatial structure. However, many digital flu estimation methods12,16,17, including GFT, ignore such spatial structure and apply the same national-level method to regional, and/or state-level flu estimation. A few attempts have been made to incorporate the geographical dependence structure. For example, Ref.18 studied the estimation of ILI activity in the boroughs and neighborhoods of New York City using a traditional epidemiological mechanistic SIRS-network model without Internet search data, where the dynamic system is multivariate with explicit parameters to characterize traffic between locales, and concluded that the spatial network is helpful at the borough scale but not at the neighborhood scale; Ref.19 utilized an ordinary-least-squares-based network model to improve upon the output of GFT, where a weighted average of GFT from all regions is produced as an network-enhanced final estimate for each individual region; Ref.20 employs a multi-task nonlinear regression method for regional %ILI estimation, where a Multi-Task Gaussian Process is proposed to regress each region’s %ILI on the corresponding Google search data; Ref.21 uses a network approach for %ILI estimation in a few selected states, where they first built a stand-alone state %ILI prediction based on the ARGO method9, and then obtained a multiple linear regression prediction for a given state’s %ILI from other states’ %ILI, and finally a winner-takes-all approach was adopted for each state separately to select one of the two approaches; Ref.22 shows that careful spatial structure modeling can lead to much improved accuracy in %ILI estimation at the regional level. An ensemble approach has also been proposed to utilize the output of a variety of available models to achieve better accuracy23.Nevertheless, at the state level, no existing methods provide real-time flu tracking with satisfactory accuracy and reliability. (i) There are no unified approaches to combine multi-resolution and cross-state information effectively to provide national, regional and state-level estimates within the same framework. (ii) Few existing models can outperform a naive estimation method, which, for each state, without any modeling effort, simply uses CDC’s reported %ILI from the previous week as the %ILI estimate for the current week (see Fig. 1 for an illustration). This would be particularly worrisome for public health officials who rely on accurate flu estimation at the local level to make informed decisions.In this article we introduce ARGOX, a unified spatial-temporal statistical framework that combines multi-resolution, multi-source information to provide real-time state-level %ILI estimates while maintaining coherency with %ILI estimation at the regional and national levels (in a cascading fashion). To illustrate the underlying idea of ARGOX, let us take estimating the %ILI in California as an example. The real-time Google search volumes for flu-related terms like "flu symptoms" or "flu duration" from California reflect its current state-level flu intensity to some extent. In addition, California’s flu epidemics could be highly correlated with flu epidemics of nearby states such as Oregon and Nevada, as well as with geographically distant but transportation-wise well-connected states such as Illinois. California’s current flu situation may also depend heavily on the recent trends of flu epidemics, in particular, the overall national and Pacific-west regional flu trends. Taken these considerations together, ARGOX operates in two steps: at the first step, it extracts Google search information of most relevant query terms at three geographical resolutions—national, regional, and state levels; at the second step, the cross-time, cross-resolution, cross-state information mentioned above, together with Internet-extracted information, is integrated through careful modeling of their temporal-spatial dependence structure, which yields significant enhancement in the estimation accuracy.ARGOX was inspired in part by Refs.9 and22, which studied the %ILI estimation at the national and regional levels respectively. Although the methods introduced in Refs.9 and22 worked well for flu-tracking at the national or regional level, these methods cannot be directly applied to accurately track state-level %ILI for a number of reasons, which are specifically solved by ARGOX. In particular, ARGOX addresses the following issues: (i) how to simultaneously provide accurate, real-time flu tracking at the higher-resolution level for all 51 US states (district/city), as opposed to only at the national or regional level, (ii) how to effectively combine multi-resolution information from the national, regional and state levels for state %ILI estimation, i.e., how to leverage the information from the national and regional levels, in addition to the information at a particular state, for the %ILI estimation at a given state; (iii) how to solve the challenge of declining quality of Internet search data at higher geographical resolution, since compared to the Internet search data at the national level, the state-level Internet search data are of much inferior quality; (iv) how to determine when to borrow information from other states for the %ILI estimation at a given state and when not to borrow, since the states have varying degree of connections—for a state well connected with others, borrowing information probably would help its %ILI estimation, but for a state not (geographically or epidemically) well connected with others, using information from other states might hurt (as opposed to help) its %ILI estimation; and (v) how to model the correlation structure of %ILI across the “well-connected” states to effectively borrow such cross-state information to improve prediction accuracy. ARGOX, therefore, significantly advances accurate flu tracking from the national and regional levels to the state level, which could help public health officials make much more informed decisions.Through the ARGOX framework, the state-level flu activity estimates are produced in a unified and coherent way with the national and regional estimates. ARGOX achieves on average 28% mean squared error (MSE) reduction compared to the best alternative and shows strong advantages over all benchmark methods, including GFT, time-series-based vector autoregression (VAR), and another recent Internet-search-based method developed in Lu et al.21. ARGOX achieves its high estimation accuracy through a few features: (i) it automatically selects the most relevant search queries to address the problem of lower-quality Google search information at state or regional level; (ii) it incorporates time-series momentum of flu activity; (iii) it pools the multi-resolution information by combining the national-, regional-, and state-level data; (iv) it explicitly models the spatial correlation structure of state-level flu activities; (v) it adapts to the evolution in people’s search pattern, Google’s search engine algorithms, epidemic trends, and other time-varying factors24 with a dynamic two-year rolling window for training; and (vi) it achieves selective pooling of most immediately relevant information for a handful of stand-alone states (details in Methods).ResultsWe conducted retrospective estimation of the weekly %ILI at the US state level—50 states excluding Florida whose ILI data is not available from CDC, plus Washington DC and New York City—for the period of Oct 11, 2014 to March 21, 2020. For each week during this period, we only used the data that would have been available—the historical CDC’s ILI reports up to the previous week and Google search data up to the current week—to estimate state-level %ILI of the current week. To evaluate the accuracy of our estimation, we compared the estimates with the actual %ILI released by CDC weeks later in multiple metrics, including the mean squared error (MSE), the mean absolute error (MAE), and the correlation with the actual %ILI (detailed in Methods). We also compared the performance of ARGOX with several benchmark methods, including (a) GFT (last estimate available: the week ending on August 15, 2015), (b) estimates by the lag-1 vector autoregressive model (VAR model), (c) the naive estimates, which for each state without any modeling effort simply use CDC’s reported %ILI of the previous week as the estimate for the current week, and (d) a recent Internet-search-based state-level estimation model developed in Lu et al.21. As ARGOX uses a two-year training window, for fair comparison we keep the same two-year training window for VAR as well. Also for fair comparison, the numerical results of the method of Lu et al.21 were directly quoted from the article (which reported results through May 14, 2017).Table 1 summarizes the overall results of ARGOX, VAR, GFT, and the naive method, averaging over the 51 states/district/city for the whole period of 2014 to 2020 (up to March 21, 2020). Table 2 summarizes the comparison between ARGOX and the method of Lu et al.21, averaging over 37 states for the period of 2014 to 2017. We need to compare ARGOX with Lu et al.21 in a separate Table 2 because the results of Lu et al.21 are only available for 37 states and only for the period of 2014 to 2017.Table 1 shows that ARGOX gives the leading performance uniformly through all flu seasons in all metrics. Particularly, ARGOX achieves up to 28% error reduction in MSE and about 15 % error reduction in MAE compared to the best alternative in the whole period. ARGOX also keeps consistent season-by-season performance, with at least 15% error reduction in MSE compared to the best alternative method in every season from 2014 to 2019. For the 2019–2020 flu season with the (onset of) COVID-19 pandemic, ARGOX’s accuracy still maintains. Compared with other benchmarks, ARGOX’s advantages in state-level flu tracking are substantial. VAR and GFT fail to outperform the naive method in any of the evaluated flu seasons; both methods have MSE two or three times larger than the naive method. Table 2 shows that ARGOX also uniformly outperforms Lu et al.21 in all three seasons when the benchmark is available. More detailed results comparing ARGOX with the benchmarks can be found in the Supplementary Information (Table S4). The advantage of ARGOX over the method of Lu et al.21 could be attributed to (i) incorporating multi-resolution information in the modeling that pools national, regional and state-level information together, (ii) capturing the spatio-temporal information using one joint statistically structured variance-covariance matrix as opposed to ad hoc regression of each individual state’s %ILI on other states’, and (iii) using a statistically principled and interpretable method to dichotomously select between either joint modeling for statistically “connected” states or stand-alone modeling for statistically/geographically “disconnected” states.Among all the methods that we numerically compared, ARGOX is the only one that uniformly outperforms the naive method in all 51 states/district/city in terms of MSE for the whole period of evaluation. Figure 1 plots the state-by-state estimation results, showing the ratio of the MSE of a given method to the MSE of the naive method. The results of four methods are plotted: ARGOX, VAR, GFT, and Lu et al.21 For each state, a blue color means that the MSE of a method is smaller (better) than the MSE of the naive method for that state, and a red color means the MSE of the method is larger (worse) than the MSE of the naive method. Darker blue means more advantage over the naive method, while darker red means more disadvantage than the naive method. It is noteworthy that ARGOX with all blue colors is the only method that gives uniformly better performance than the native method across all states. All other methods in comparison fail to do so for a large portion of the states investigated. Note that the naive method provides a model-free baseline benchmark that solely relies on information from CDC’s flu reports. Therefore, ARGOX is the only method that effectively utilizes the Internet data to uniformly improve flu tracking from the traditional surveillance system, indicating ARGOX’s reliability and adaptability. With its universally enhanced accuracy over the alternative methods for real-time state-level flu situation estimate, it appears that ARGOX could aid timely, proper public health decision making for the local monitoring and control of the disease.Detailed numerical results for each state and for each flu season are reported in Tables S5–S55 and the figures in Supporting Information (SI), where ARGOX holds lead over other methods in the vast majority of the cases, further revealing its robustness over geographical and seasonal variability in flu epidemics.In addition to the point estimate, ARGOX also provides 95% confidence intervals for each week’s estimates. For the entire period from 2014 to 2020, over all 51 states/district/city, the intervals provided by ARGOX successfully cover the actual %ILI in 92.5% of the cases (Table S1), which is close to the nominal 95%, demonstrating ARGOX’s accurate uncertainty quantification.DiscussionARGOX effectively combines state-, regional-, and national-level publicly available data from Google searches and CDC’s traditional flu surveillance system. It incorporates geographical and temporal correlation of flu activities to provide accurate, reliable real-time flu tracking at the state level. Across all the available states, ARGOX outperforms time-series-based benchmark models, GFT, and the method of Lu et al.21 ARGOX’s weekly %ILI estimations are accompanied by reliable interval estimates as a measure for uncertainty. The state-level real-time tracking of flu epidemics by ARGOX could help public health officials and the general public to make more informed decisions to control and prevent the flu epidemics at the state or local levels. In particular, with the real-time estimates of flu activities by ARGOX in their home states and neighboring states, local public health officials could make more proper and timely decisions on the allocation of relevant resources, such as vaccines, hospitalization, medical equipment, personnel, etc. Also, informed with the current local flu situation provided by ARGOX, the general public could take necessary measures accordingly, such as taking the flu shot, social distancing, and mask wearing to reduce the risk of contracting flu; knowing the real-time flu severity at other states could help the general public make travel decisions and plan/arrange care for relatives and friends. More discussion on the usefulness of influenza forecasts to public health decision making can be found in Ref.25 and Ref.23.ARGOX’s adaptive pooling of the most-relevant information among the 51 US states/district/city plays an important role in its performance. To avoid the possibility of overfitting, a structured covariance matrix on the %ILI increments is utilized. Such structured dynamic modeling of the cross-state covariance serves to capture the ever-changing geographic spread pattern of the flu. It aggregates state-to-state, time-varying connectivity factors such as commuting traffic, airline frequency, geographic proximity, and climatic patterns. The utilization of cross-state correlation also helps pool information from different states, regions and the entire nation in addition to the information at a given state. The pooling from national and regional level estimates incorporates the shared seasonality component in flu trends across all the states, which further helps reduce the risk of overfitting.ARGOX operates in two steps: the first step extracts Internet search information at the state level, and the second step enhances the estimates using cross-state and cross-resolution information (detailed in Methods). Such two-step design of ARGOX has broad applicability. With the general availability of ubiquitous Internet search data, ARGOX’s two-step framework could be flexibly adapted to track flu activities at even higher resolutions, such as county or city levels, when such weekly %ILI data become available. In addition, the first step could be substituted by other models or include other data sources, while the second step remains adaptable for multi-resolution spatial-temporal boosting. A wide spectrum of flu estimation models, including susceptible-infectious-recovered-susceptible model7, empirical Bayes method16, Wisdom-of-crowds forecast17, or ensemble of them26 can be fitted into the cross-state boosting step (the second step) of ARGOX.Like all big-data-based models, our result has certain limitations. ARGOX’s accuracy depends on the reliability of its inputs—Google Trends data and historical %ILI data from CDC. Google Trends data have increasing amount of missing data and zero counts as the resolution goes from national to regional and state levels (Table S3). Such degeneracy in data quality is a challenge for high-resolution inference. Google search information could also be sensitive to media coverage27,28,29. Furthermore, Google search data may only be representative of the search interests among Google users rather than the entire population. In states with less Internet penetration, such Google search data may be less predictive of the overall %ILI. The \(L_1\) penalty and the dynamic training of ARGOX aims to correct for the sparsity, over-shooting, and representative issues of Google data, where only the most relevant search terms to %ILI estimation are selected at each state’s level. Models to further alleviate or eliminate the bias in Internet search data (e.g. by incorporating data on media coverage intensity) could be an interesting future direction. In addition, we should be aware that our estimation target, the CDC’s %ILI, is only a proxy for the true flu incidence in the population, as it’s calculated from a sample of outpatient visits with influenza-like symptoms. The reported %ILI at the state level could have (i) high noise due to its limited sample size, (ii) subsequent revision when healthcare providers update their information, and (iii) bias towards those with easy healthcare access. Nevertheless, accurate estimation of CDC’s %ILI at the state level is valuable for optimizing resource allocations. More detailed discussion about the importance of alternative indicators for flu incidence in the population can be found in Ref.30,31,32.ARGOX is accurate, reliable, flexible and generalizable, making it adaptable to other spatial and temporal resolutions for tracking or forecasting other diseases and social/economic events that leave traces on people’s Internet activity records. The ARGOX framework can be potentially adapted for COVID-19 tracking by incorporating additional coronavirus-related query terms at city, state, regional, and national level33. With the current development of COVID-19 pandemic, it is likely that the coronavirus would come back in the future winters. In light of this, accurate localized tracking of epidemic activity has become more important than ever before.MethodsCDC’s ILINet dataEvery Friday, CDC releases a report of %ILI for the previous week, which gives the percent of outpatient visits with influenza-like illness for the whole nation, each HHS region, each state (except Florida), Washington DC, and New York City (separated from New York State) (http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/overview.htm). CDC also revises the initial report numbers in the subsequent weeks when more information becomes available (gis.cdc.gov/grasp/fluview/fluportaldashboard.html). Consequently, CDC’s %ILI data lag behind real-time for up to 2 weeks and are less accurate for more recent weeks. CDC’s %ILI data for this study were downloaded on Mar 27, 2020.Google dataThe Internet search volume data from Google are publicly available through Google Trends (trends.google.com). A user can specify the desired query term, geographical location, and time frame on Google Trends; the website then will return a (weekly) time series in integer values from 0 to 100, which corresponds to the normalized search volume of the query term within the specified time frame, where 100 represents the historical maximum, and 0 represents missing data due to inadequate search intensity. This integer-valued time series from Google Trends is based on sampling Google’s raw search logs.The search query terms that we use are based on previous work for national and regional flu estimation9,22. We also included several additional queries and topics in this study, which were obtained from “Related queries” and “Related topics” on the Google Trends website when searching for flu related information. Table S2 in the Supplementary Information lists these search terms.As one benchmark, we downloaded the discontinued Google Flu Trends (GFT) data (https://www.google.org/flutrends/about/data/flu/us/data.txt). GFT has national, regional, and state-level prediction for the weekly %ILI from Jan 1, 2004 to August 9, 2015.Google search data may only be representative of the search interests among Google users rather than the entire population. ARGOX attempts to correct for such potential bias in the modeling.Regional-Enrichment of state-level Google search dataGoogle Trends provides (normalized) search volume data at both national and state levels. However, for the state-level data, there is a high level of sparsity (i.e., zero observations) among the returned integer-valued time series (see Table S3). These zeros, which correspond to missing data due to inadequate search intensity, significantly lower the data quality at the state level (compared to the national level), which in turn severely reduces the prediction accuracy at the state level. To enhance the predictive power of state-level Google data, we use a simple approach to borrow information from the regional level. First, we reconstruct regional-level search frequency for each region in the US by weighting the state-level search frequencies within a given region, where the weights are proportional to the state’s population. Second, instead of using the state-level Google Trends time-series, for each search term, we use a weighted average of the state-level search frequency (2/3 weight) and the regional-level search frequency (1/3 weight) as the input for state-level %ILI estimation. We carry out this regional-enrichment process for all states/district/city, except seven states—Hawaii (HI), Alaska (AK), Vermont (VT), Montana (MT), North Dakota (ND), Maine (ME), and South Dakota (SD)—because these seven states are modeled with a separate stand-alone model (as detailed in the following sections). For these seven states, the raw Google Trends state-level times series, not the regional-enriched time series, are used as input.Evaluation metricsWe use three metrics to evaluate the accuracy of an estimate against the actual %ILI released by CDC: the mean squared error (MSE), the mean absolute error (MAE), and the Pearson correlation (Correlation). MSE between an estimate \({\hat{p}}_t\) and the true value \(p_t\) over period \(t=1,\ldots , T\) is \(\frac{1}{T}\sum _{t=1}^T \left( {\hat{p}}_t - p_t\right) ^2\). MAE between an estimate \({\hat{p}}_t\) and the true value \(p_t\) over period \(t=1,\ldots , T\) is \(\frac{1}{T}\sum _{t=1}^T \left| {\hat{p}}_t - p_t\right|\). Correlation is the Pearson correlation coefficient between \(\hat{{\varvec{p}}}=({\hat{p}}_1, \dots , {\hat{p}}_T)\) and \({\varvec{p}}=(p_1,\dots , p_T)\).Prediction model of ARGOXARGOX operates in two steps: the first step extracts Internet search information at the state level, and the second step enhances the estimates using cross-state and cross-resolution information.At the second step, we take a dichotomous approach for the 51 US states/district/city (50 states except Florida, which does not have %ILI data, plus Washington DC and New York City). We set apart seven states: HI, AK, VT, MT, ND, ME, and SD. The first two (HI and AK) are geographically separated from the contiguous US. The last five (VT, MT, ND, ME, and SD) are the states that have the lowest multiple correlations (a.k.a. the R) in %ILI to the %ILI of the entire nation, the %ILI of the other states, and the %ILI of the other regions (detailed calculation method is given in Supplementary Information). A low multiple correlation of a state implies that the state’s flu activity is not well correlated with other states’ or other regions’. For these seven states, due to either the geological discontinuity or the low multiple correlation, it is not clear if using information cross the other states or other regions can help the state-level %ILI estimation. Therefore, we adopt the dichotomous approach: For the 44 states/district/city (the vast majority), we apply a joint estimation approach at the second step to enhance the state-level %ILI estimation by using all information, including information from other states and other regions; for the above-mentioned seven states, we use a stand-alone estimation approach at the second step to enhance the %ILI estimation (not using information from other states and regions). The two steps of ARGOX are detailed below.First step: extracting Internet search information at the state levelThis step concerns extracting Google search information at each state. In particular, for a given state/district/city m, \(m= 1, \dots , 51\), let \(X_{i,t,m}\) be the logarithm of 1 plus the state-level Google Trends data of search term i at week t (note: 1 is added to each state-level Google Trends data point to avoid taking logarithm of zero); let \(y_{t,m}\) be the logit-transformation of CDC’s %ILI at time t for state m. To estimate \(y_{T,m}\), an \(L_1\) regularized linear estimator is used in the first step based on the vector \({\varvec{X}}_{T,m} = (x_{i,T,m})\):$$\begin{aligned} {\hat{y}}_{T,m} = {\hat{\beta }}_{0,m} + {\varvec{X}}_{T,m}^{^\intercal }\hat{\varvec{\beta}}_m, \end{aligned}$$where the coefficients \(({\hat{\beta }}_{0,m}, \hat{\varvec{\beta }}_m)\) are obtained via$$\begin{aligned} \underset{\beta _{0,m}, {\varvec{\beta}}_m}{\mathrm{argmin}}\sum _{t=T-N}^{T-1} \left( y_{t,m} -\beta _{0,m} - {\varvec{X}}^{^\intercal }_{t,m}{\varvec{\beta}}_m\right) ^2 + \lambda \Vert {\varvec{\beta}}_m\Vert _1. \end{aligned}$$ (1) We set \(N=104\), i.e., a two-year window, as recommended in previous studies9,22,24. We set \(\lambda\) through cross-validation.In addition, we obtain an accurate estimate \({\hat{p}}^{nat}_T\) for the national %ILI by using the ARGO method9, which uses national level Google search data. We also obtain an estimate \(({\hat{p}}_{T, 1}^{reg}, \dots ,{\hat{p}}_{T,10}^{reg})\) for the ten HHS regional %ILI by the first step of ARGO2 method22, which uses aggregated regional level Google search data.Second step: joint model for the 44 states/district/city other than HI, AK, ND, VT, MT, ME, and SDFor the 44 states, let \({\varvec{p}}_t=(p_{t,1},\dots , p_{t,44})^\intercal\) denote CDC’s %ILI at the state level; they are related to \(y_{t,m}\) through \(p_{t,m}=\exp (y_{t,m})/(1+\exp (y_{t,m}))\). Our raw estimate for \({\varvec{p}}_t\) from the first step is \(\hat{\varvec{p}}^{GT}_{t} = ({\hat{p}}_{t,1},\dots , {\hat{p}}_{t,44})^\intercal\), where \({\hat{p}}_{t,m} = \exp ({\hat{y}}_{t,m})/(1+\exp ({\hat{y}}_{t,m}))\). Our estimate of the national %ILI from the first step is \({\hat{p}}_t^{nat}\). Let the boldface \(\hat{\varvec{p}}_t^{nat}\) denote the length-44 vector \(\hat{\varvec{p}}_t^{nat}=({\hat{p}}_t^{nat}, \dots ,{\hat{p}}_t^{nat})^\intercal\). We also have the regional %ILI estimate \(({\hat{p}}_{t, 1}^{reg}, \dots ,{\hat{p}}_{t,10}^{reg})\) from the first step. Let \(\hat{\varvec{p}}_t^{reg}\) denote the length-44 vector \(\hat{\varvec{p}}_t^{reg}=({\hat{p}}_{t, r_1}^{reg}, \dots ,{\hat{p}}_{t, r_{44}}^{reg})^\intercal\), where \(r_m\) is the region number for state m.Estimating \({\varvec{p}}_t\) is equivalent to estimating the time series increment \(\Delta {\varvec{p}}_{t} = {\varvec{p}}_{t} - {\varvec{p}}_{t-1}\). We denote \({\varvec{Z}}_{t} = \Delta {\varvec{p}}_{t}\) for notational simplicity. For the estimation of \({\varvec{Z}}_{t}\), we want to incorporate the cross-state, cross-source correlations. We have four predictors for \({\varvec{Z}}_{t}\) after the first step: (i) \({\varvec{Z}}_{t-1}=\Delta {\varvec{p}}_{t-1}\), (ii) \(\hat{\varvec{p}}_{t}^{GT} - {\varvec{p}}_{t-1}\), (iii) \(\hat{\varvec{p}}_{t}^{reg} - {\varvec{p}}_{t-1}\), and (iv) \(\hat{\varvec{p}}_{t}^{nat} - {\varvec{p}}_{t-1}\) ; they represent time series information, information from the state level Google search, information from the regional level estimation, and information from the national level estimation, respectively. Let \({\varvec{W}}_{t}\) denote the collection of these four vectors \({\varvec{W}}_{t}=({\varvec{Z}}_{t-1}^\intercal , (\hat{\varvec{p}}_{t}^{GT} - {\varvec{p}}_{t-1})^\intercal , (\hat{\varvec{p}}_{t}^{reg} - {\varvec{p}}_{t-1})^\intercal , (\hat{\varvec{p}}_{t}^{nat} - {\varvec{p}}_{t-1})^\intercal )^\intercal\).To combine the four predictors, we use the best linear predictor formed by them:$$\begin{aligned} \hat{\varvec{Z}}_{t} = {\varvec{\mu}}_{Z} + \Sigma _{ZW}\Sigma _{WW}^{-1}({\varvec{W}}_t-{\varvec{\mu}}_{W}), \end{aligned}$$ (2) where \(\mu _Z\) and \(\mu _W\) are the mean vectors of \({\varvec{Z}}\) and \({\varvec{W}}\) respectively, and \(\Sigma _{ZZ}\), \(\Sigma _{ZW}\), and \(\Sigma _{WW}\) are the covariance matrices of and between \({\varvec{Z}}\) and \({\varvec{W}}\). The best linear predictor gives the optimal way to linearly combine the four predictors to form a new one. The variance of \(\hat{\varvec{Z}}_{t}\) is$$\begin{aligned} {\mathrm{Var}}(\hat{\varvec{Z}}_{t}|{\varvec{W}}_t) = \Sigma _{ZZ} - \Sigma _{ZW}\Sigma _{WW}^{-1}\Sigma _{WZ}. \end{aligned}$$ (3) Consistent with the first step, we adopt a sliding two-year training window to estimate \(\mu _Z\), \(\mu _W\), \(\Sigma _{ZZ}\), \(\Sigma _{ZW}\), and \(\Sigma _{WW}\) in Eq. (2) and (3). For \(\mu _Z\) and \(\mu _W\), we use the empirical mean of the corresponding variables as the estimates. However, for the covariance matrices, due to their large sizes and the small number of observations, we need to structure the covariance matrices for reliable estimation.We assume the following structure: 1. The covariances between the time series increments satisfy \({\mathrm{Var}}({\varvec{Z}}_{t})={\mathrm{Var}}({\varvec{Z}}_{t-1})=\Sigma _{ZZ}\) and \({\mathrm{Cov}}({\varvec{Z}}_{t}, {\varvec{Z}}_{t-1})=\rho \Sigma _{ZZ}\), where \(0<\rho <1\). This essentially assumes that the time series increments are stationary and have a stable autocorrelation across time and states. 2. Independence among the different sources of information: time series increment, the estimation error of the first-step state-level estimate, the estimation error of the regional estimate, and the estimation error of the national estimate, i.e., \({\varvec{Z}}_{t}, \hat{\varvec{p}}_{t}^{GT} - {\varvec{p}}_{t}, \hat{\varvec{p}}_{t}^{reg} - {\varvec{p}}_{t}, \hat{\varvec{p}}_{t}^{nat} - {\varvec{p}}_{t}\) are all mutually independent. The covariance matrices are thereby simplified as:$$\begin{aligned} \Sigma _{ZW}= & {} \begin{pmatrix} \rho \Sigma _{ZZ}&\Sigma _{ZZ}&\Sigma _{ZZ}&\Sigma _{ZZ} \end{pmatrix} \end{aligned}$$ (4) $$\begin{aligned} \Sigma _{WW}= & {} \begin{pmatrix} \Sigma _{ZZ}&{}\rho \Sigma _{ZZ}&{} \rho \Sigma _{ZZ}&{} \rho \Sigma _{ZZ}\\ \rho \Sigma _{ZZ}&{} \Sigma _{ZZ} + \Sigma ^{GT}&{} \Sigma _{ZZ}&{} \Sigma _{ZZ}\\ \rho \Sigma _{ZZ}&{} \Sigma _{ZZ}&{} \Sigma _{ZZ} +\Sigma ^{reg}&{} \Sigma _{ZZ}\\ \rho \Sigma _{ZZ}&{} \Sigma _{ZZ}&{} \Sigma _{ZZ}&{} \Sigma _{ZZ} +\Sigma ^{nat}\\ \end{pmatrix} \end{aligned}$$ (5) where \(\Sigma ^{reg} = {\mathrm{Var}}(\hat{\varvec{p}}_{t}^{reg} - {\varvec{p}}_{t})\), \(\Sigma ^{nat} = {\mathrm{Var}}(\hat{\varvec{p}}_{t}^{nat} - {\varvec{p}}_{t})\), and \(\Sigma ^{GT} = {\mathrm{Var}}(\hat{\varvec{p}}_{t}^{GT} - {\varvec{p}}_{t})\). To further control the estimation stability, we incorporate a ridge-regression-inspired shrinkage34 to the linear predictor (2), replacing the joint covariance matrix of \(({\varvec{Z}}_t^\intercal , {\varvec{W}}_t^\intercal )^\intercal\) by the average of the structured covariance matrix and its empirical diagonal. Effectively, in Eq. (2), \(\Sigma _{ZW}\) is replaced by \(\frac{1}{2} \Sigma _{ZW}\), and \(\Sigma _{WW}\) is replaced by \((\frac{1}{2}\Sigma _{WW}+\frac{1}{2}D_{WW})\), where \(D_{WW}\) is the diagonal of the empirical covariance of \({\varvec{W}}_t\):$$\begin{aligned} \hat{\varvec{Z}}_{t} = {\varvec{\mu}}_{Z} + \frac{1}{2}\Sigma _{ZW}(\frac{1}{2}\Sigma _{WW}+\frac{1}{2}D_{WW})^{-1}({\varvec{W}}_t-{\varvec{\mu}}_{W}). \end{aligned}$$ (6) \(\Sigma _{ZZ}\), \(\Sigma ^{nat}\), \(\Sigma ^{reg}\), \(\Sigma ^{GT}\) and \(D_{WW}\) are estimated by the corresponding sample covariance from the data in the most recent 2-year training window; \(\rho\) is estimated by minimizing the Frobenius norm (\(L_2\) distance) between the empirical correlation and structured correlation. Based on Eq. (3), the variance estimate is similarly updated by$$\begin{aligned} {\mathrm{Var}}(\hat{\varvec{Z}}_{t}|{\varvec{W}}_t) = \Sigma _{ZZ} - \frac{1}{2}\Sigma _{ZW}(\frac{1}{2}\Sigma _{WW}+\frac{1}{2}D_{WW})^{-1}\frac{1}{2}\Sigma _{WZ}. \end{aligned}$$Our final state-level %ILI estimate for week T after the second step is:$$\begin{aligned} {\hat{\varvec{p}}}_{T} = {\varvec{p}}_{T-1} + \hat{\varvec{\mu }}_Z + {\hat{\Sigma }}_{ZW}({\hat{\Sigma }}_{WW}+{\hat{D}}_{WW})^{-1}({\varvec{W}}_T-\hat{\varvec{\mu }}_{W}), \end{aligned}$$ (7) with corresponding 95% interval estimate$$\begin{aligned} \left[ {\hat{\varvec{p}}}_{T} \pm 1.96 \cdot \sqrt{{\mathrm{diagonal}} \left( {{\hat{\Sigma }}}_{ZZ} - \frac{1}{2}{{\hat{\Sigma }}}_{ZW}({{\hat{\Sigma }}}_{WW}+{\hat{D}}_{WW})^{-1}{{\hat{\Sigma }}}_{WZ} \right) }\right] . \end{aligned}$$Second step: stand-alone model for HI, AK, ND, VT, MT, ME and SDFor \(m \in \{\text {HI, AK, ND, VT, MT, ME, SD}\}\), we take a stand-alone modeling approach. For each of these states, which is either non-contiguous or has the lowest multiple correlation with out-of-state %ILI (detailed in Supplementary Information), we focus on estimating the individual state’s %ILI by integrating the within-state and national information in the second step. Thereby, our target is a scalar \(Z_{t}^{(m)} = p_{t, m} - p_{t-1, m}\), the state’s %ILI increment at the current week. The predictor vector in the second step for state m is \({\varvec{W}}_{t}^{(m)} =({Z}_{t-1}^{(m)}, (\hat{{p}}_{t, m}^{GT} - {p}_{t-1, m}), (\hat{{p}}_{t}^{nat} - {p}_{t-1, m}))\), where the regional terms are dropped. The best linear predictor with ridge-regression inspired shrinkage is then used to get the final estimate$$\begin{aligned} \hat{{Z}}_{t}^{(m)} = {\mu }_{Z}^{(m)} + \frac{1}{2}\Sigma _{ZW}^{(m)}(\frac{1}{2}\Sigma _{WW}^{(m)}+\frac{1}{2}D_{WW}^{(m)})^{-1}({\varvec{W}}_t^{(m)}-{\varvec{\mu }}_{W}^{(m)}). \end{aligned}$$ (8) The corresponding covariance matrices between the components \(\Sigma _{ZW}^{(m)} = {\mathrm{Cov}}(Z^{(m)}, {\varvec{W}}^{(m)})\), \(\Sigma _{WW}^{(m)} = {\mathrm{Var}}({\varvec{W}}^{(m)})\), and \(D_{WW}^{(m)} = {\mathrm{diagonal}}(\Sigma _{WW}^{(m)})\) are estimated by the corresponding sample covariance from the data in the most recent 2-year training window.The final state-level %ILI estimate for week T after the second step for \(m \in \{\text {HI, AK, ND, VT, MT, ME, SD}\}\) is:$$\begin{aligned} \hat{{p}}_{T, m} = {{p}}_{T-1, m} + {\hat{\mu }}_{Z}^{(m)} + {\hat{\Sigma }}_{ZW}^{(m)}({\hat{\Sigma }}_{WW}^{(m)}+{\hat{D}}_{WW}^{(m)})^{-1}({\varvec{W}}_T^{(m)}-\hat{\varvec{\mu }}_{W}^{(m)}), \end{aligned}$$ (9) with corresponding 95% interval estimate$$\begin{aligned} \left[ {\hat{{p}}}_{T,m} \pm 1.96 \cdot \sqrt{{{\hat{\Sigma }}}_{ZZ}^{(m)} - \frac{1}{2}{{\hat{\Sigma }}}_{ZW}^{(m)}({{\hat{\Sigma }}}_{WW}^{(m)}+{\hat{D}}_{WW}^{(m)})^{-1}{{\hat{\Sigma }}}_{WZ}^{(m)} }\right] , \end{aligned}$$where \(\Sigma _{ZZ}^{(m)} = {\mathrm{Var}}(Z^{(m)})\) is the scalar variance of the univariate time series \(Z_{t}^{(m)}\).

Advanced Search Home News Releases Multimedia Meetings Login Register News Release 18-Feb-2021 Pre-existing immunity protects against airborne spread of flu viruses Peer-Reviewed Publication PLOS image: University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine virologists conducted an experiment to learn about the transmission of pandemic diseases, like influenza and COVID-19. Through experiments in ferrets that mimic real world conditions for humans, they shed more light on how proximity, masks or other barriers, time spent with someone who is infectious, and pre-existing immunity from vaccines or prior infection may influence the likelihood of someone contracting a virus. view more Credit: University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC), MEDIA518719 JAB/AH 1/21 Pre-existing immunity is an important barrier to airborne transmission of influenza viruses and can influence the emergence and spread of potentially pandemic viruses, according to a study published February 18 in the open-access journal PLOS Pathogens by Seema Lakdawala of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, and colleagues. Influenza viruses pose a major public health threat through both seasonal epidemics and sporadic pandemics. Every influenza season is different, with one virus subtype (H3N2 or H1N1) typically dominating. In the 2017-2018 H3N2 influenza season, 40% of the cases were in the elderly, in contrast to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, in which the highest burden of infection was found in individuals 5-24 years of age. This age-based discrepancy suggests that pre-existing immunity could impact susceptibility to infection, since people of different age groups are exposed to different strains in early childhood. But the precise role of immunity from previous infections on susceptibility to airborne infection has been unclear. This is an important question to answer because airborne transmission is critical for the emergence of pandemic viruses such as H1N1 and SARS-CoV-2, which is responsible for COVID-19. Using the ferret model, Lakdawala and colleagues examined the roles of exposure duration and immunity on influenza transmission. The results showed that a 48-hour exposure is sufficient for efficient transmission of H1N1 and H3N2 viruses. Moreover, pre-existing immunity against the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus protected animals from airborne transmission of a seasonal H3N2 influenza virus. This protection did not depend on cross-neutralizing antibodies, so understanding the underlying immunological mechanism will require further studies. According to the authors, the findings may have important implications for the current COVID-19 pandemic. The authors add, "Prior immunity to influenza viruses can provide a barrier to airborne transmission of seasonal viruses. This may help to explain the heterogeneity in seasonal influenza transmission and susceptibility of different aged populations to circulating strains." ### Peer-reviewed; Experimental study; Animals In your coverage please use this URL to provide access to the freely available article in PLOS Pathogens: http://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1009273 Citation: Le Sage V, Jones JE, Kormuth KA, Fitzsimmons WJ, Nturibi E, Padovani GH, et al.

UQ PhD candidate Katina Hulme said this was due to the asthma’s suppression of the immune system. “We were first tipped off about this during the 2009 swine flu pandemic,” Ms Hulme said. “Asthma was identified as the most common underlying medical condition in individuals hospitalised with flu, and these individuals were at a greater risk of ICU admission. “Our lab studies have found that non-allergic asthma, or PGA, can suppress immune response to flu and with the immune system compromised, the virus is left unchecked and can replicate more than it does in a healthy individual. “And, since the flu is not so good at proof-reading its genetic code when replicating, it makes a lot of mistakes, and with more replication comes more opportunity for mutations to emerge.” To conduct the research, the researchers used an asthmatic mouse model with influenza virus. From there, computer-driven analysis of the virus genome was used to identify mutations that emerged exclusively in the asthmatic group. UQ’s Dr Kirsty Short said while these tests were preliminary and conducted in animals, the results may reflect a broader phenomenon in humans. “Our study produced clear findings that fit well with what we know about a suppressed immune response and the emergence of influenza virus variants,” Dr Short said. “Which is particularly relevant in the context of COVID-19, where it has been suggested that the so-called UK variant arose because of a prolonged infection in an immunocompromised patient. “For this study, it would be interesting to get access to clinical asthmatic samples to potentially confirm what we’ve found experimentally. “Our study provides the first evidence that asthma may influence the evolution of the influenza virus, and – transmission permitting – could lead to the emergence of more pathogenic strains into the community. “It’s therefore really important to remember that host-viral interactions are bidirectional and that host co-morbidities can influence the evolution of influenza virus.” The research has been published in eLife (DOI: 10.7554/eLife.61803).

stages of an influenza (flu) infection.(U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)At a GlanceThe new strain is believed to be more easily transmissible.Researchers say fewer people, especially kids, had immunity to it.Last year saw one of the highest numbers of pediatric flu deaths on record.A new, more transmissible strain of the flu may have circulated in the U.S. last year, according to new research from the University of Georgia.Researchers said the new flu strain was a variant of the less common Type B influenza virus and followed a flu season in 2018-2019 that was mostly impacted by the more common Type A flu virus. The combination of the two meant that not only was the strain possibly more transmissible, but it also encountered a population with little existing immunity to it.The study also says that could be why the 2019-2020 flu season started off unusually early, affected children in higher numbers than normal, and was more impacted by by a Type B influenza virus instead of one of the more common Type A viruses.“We arrived at the explanation that it really was increased transmissibility of this novel variant, and at the same time the fact that the susceptible population, the population of individuals naïve to this virus, was larger than you would expect, which led to the dynamics that we see,” Pejman Rohani, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Georgia and the paper’s senior author, said in a news release.The study was recently published in the journal PNAS.(MORE: A Slow Flu Season Could Spell Trouble for Next Flu Season)The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that between 39 million and 56 million people were sickened by influenza and as many as 62,000 died from flu complications between October 1, 2019 and April 4, 2020.AdvertisementIt was one of the worst flu seasons on record for kids, with at least 188 pediatric flu deaths.“In the paper, we mention younger individuals were more severely affected [in 2019-2020] and that’s likely related to them having less time to be infected by other B viruses," Rebecca Borchering, another author of the paper and also a scientist at the University of Georgia, said. Influenza B reigned as a more prevalent flu virus at the start of the season in October 2019, which was unusual. It was followed by increasing cases of the typically more common influenza A. Health experts warned that some people could be infected by each strain, creating a "double-barrel" flu season.“Influenza B viruses until now have been thought of as the junior partner in this endeavor, and what our paper demonstrates is that, in the 2019-2020 flu season, they were in fact the senior partner in the U.S. flu epidemic,” Rohani said.Rohani and Borchering said the study points to a need for further flu surveillance outside of the traditional season and for hospitals to prepare for cases that may occur earlier than usual. They also said the research has implications for future vaccine development and transmission.“Our study suggests it’s important to keep an eye on the evolution of influenza B to avoid a vaccine mismatch in the same way they do with H3N2,” Rohani said. “Anticipating the timing of influenza A and influenza B epidemics could improve vaccination schedules so that individuals have protection throughout the influenza season.”The Weather Company’s primary journalistic mission is to report on breaking weather news, the environment and the importance of science to our lives.

News What the Covid-19 pandemic looks like compared to the 1918 influenza pandemic by: Kalie Marantette Posted: Feb 19, 2021 / 11:54 PM EST Updated: Feb 20, 2021 / 08:34 PM EST by: Kalie Marantette Posted: Feb 19, 2021 / 11:54 PM EST Updated: Feb 20, 2021 / 08:34 PM EST SHARE EAST LANSING, Mich. (WLNS)– From deaths to life-saving vaccines, there’s a wide variety of similarities and differences between the 1918 influenza pandemic and Covid-19 pandemic. A recent study from Michigan State University took a deep dive into the two pandemics that are 102 years apart. Siddharth Chandra, the lead author of the study, is a professor of economics at James Madison College. He is also a professor at the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at MSU as well as the Director of the Asian Studies Center. Chandra has been studying the 1918 influenza pandemic since 2010 and watched what he had been studying for ten years come to life in March 2020. “It was a really bizarre feeling, ” said Chandra, ” in the statistics, in the books that I’d read, in the stories that I’d read of people telling their experiences in 1918 it sounded all too familiar.” Covid-19 and influenza are similar because they’re both a respiratory virus and can be deadly. They both first spiked in the spring around March and are also similar when it comes to vaccines. “We had no vaccine for the SAR-CoV-2 either and so we were in the same at least initially in the same helpless situation that populations found themselves in 1918,” said Chandra. When it comes to deaths, Chandra says in 1918, there was an estimated 675,000 Americans who died from influenza. So far during the Covid-19 pandemic, there have been nearly 500,000 deaths nationwide. There is also a bigger population now than there was 102 years ago. The 1918 pandemic actually lasted two years and there was a major spike in 1920. “When February came around, February 1920, and the weather warmed just slightly, there was a fourth wave of influenza that hit Michigan,” said Chandra. He added that the fourth wave was the worst in Michigan, but other states didn’t experience the same spike. Graph showing the influenza pandemic from 1918-1920.COURTESY: Siddharth Chandra In 1918, Chandra says health experts weren’t sure what was causing influenza and thought it was bacteria that caused it, then later discovered that a virus caused it. Another big difference between the influenza pandemic and the Covid-19 pandemic is the age group that had the highest number of deaths. The graph and chart below show that in 1918, people between the ages of 20-40 had the highest fatality rate: Chandra says the key now, is to not let history repeat itself. “We have to immunize enough people so that the reservoir, the pool of people who are susceptible is so small that our population as a whole will not be at risk of another wave,” said Chandra.

The photo shown in Michael Jesberger's presentation is from The Historical Medical Library of The College of Physicians of Philadelphia.ExpandBy Bob Keeler | bkeeler@montgomerynews.comUPDATED: September 23, 2021 at 7:59 AM ESTWEST ROCKHILL – A year ago, the Spanish Influenza was included in, but only a small part of, historical lecturer Michael Jesberger’s presentations on World War I.Now he’s got a separate presentation about the pandemic that killed more than 50 million people worldwide, including more than 650,000 in the United States, about 12,000 of which deaths were in the Philadelphia area between the spring of 1918 and summer of 1919.“I just had to tell the story tonight because it is oh so familiar,” with many parallels to the current COVID-19 pandemic, Jesberger, a Lansdale resident, said at the start of his “The Spanish Influenza – Philadelphia 1918” presentation Feb. 11 to the West Rockhill Historical Society.Because of the current pandemic, the program was held as a Zoom meeting.In the Philadelphia area, the 1918 pandemic “exploded” following one particular event, Jesberger said.“September 28, 1918 in Philadelphia, more than 200,000 people turned out to witness the latest Liberty Loan parade – a patriotic event designed to inspire public financing for World War I. Organizers went ahead with the parade in the midst of an influenza epidemic that already had decimated New England and was gaining ground at the Philadelphia Navy Yard and surrounding Philadelphia area,” Jesberger wrote in program information. “It proved to be a crucial mistake. The parade became a breeding ground for the infection. Within days, the influenza had become so widespread that Philadelphia and state officials essentially shut down the city.”By October 25, 1918, an estimated 150,000 people in Philadelphia were infected, with 4,500 deaths in one week and 837 deaths on one day on Oct. 12, 1918, he said.Children, meanwhile, were reciting a rhyme as they jumped rope: “I had a little bird/and it’s name was Enza/I opened a window/and in flew Enza.” Photos from the time included people wearing face masks similar to those worn today. In one of the photos, a woman is holding a sign reading, “Wear mask or go to jail.”One man claimed to have a cure that was found to instead be candy, Jesberger said. In response to an emailed question about the similarities between then and now, Jesberger wrote, “Both are contagious respiratory diseases with very similar symptoms, but a person infected with Covid can take longer to develop symptoms than if they had the flu where it can take 1 to 4 days after the infection. Similarities between the two are shortness of doctors and nurses, not enough hospital beds, restrictions on public gatherings and events, strong emphasis on wearing masks and washing hands, no available vaccination (until recently) and both are not selective in when, who and where it would strike. Both spread panic across the world with significant loss of life.”“Tough program, but you did a great job,” West Rockhill Historical Society President Brenda Phelan told Jesberger at the conclusion.“It’s important history,” Jesberger replied.Along with adding the Spanish Influenza presentation, he said, he has also added one on the cholera pandemic in the 1830s and 1840s. Before, the cholera pandemic had been only a small part of his presentation on Duffy’s Cut, he said. Duffy’s Cut is a section of railroad tracks built in 1832 about 30 miles west of Philadelphia where 57 Irish immigrants working on the tracks all died in less than two months after arriving. Their deaths were initially thought to all have been from the cholera pandemic, but forensic evidence now indicates some may have been murdered, perhaps because of fears of the disease spreading.Asked in the email why he decided to do the separate presentations on the pandemics, Jesberger said, “There was a false sense of security in our modern age that this type of cataclysmic pandemic could not be repeated or that it would not last long enough without a cure to inflict high casualty numbers.”He said he wanted to remind everyone that the next generations will be talking about us and what we went through.“We, ourselves, are creating history,” Jesberger said.With March marking one year since COVID-19 changed the way we live, people are showing more interest in learning from the past, he said. Jesberger will again be presenting the Spanish Influenza program 2 p.m. March 20 as a Zoom program through the Hershey Public Library.

LOS ANGELES - As 2020’s fall and winter seasons approached, health officials worried that the United States would be simultaneously fighting and dealing with the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and flu season, but that has not been the case, according to experts. Some coined the feared coalescence of coronavirus and influenza as a "twindemic." "We were very worried about that," Dr. David Thomas, a professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins University, told FOX Television Stations. "One of the reasons we were worried about it is just because of the capacity to take care of people." Every winter there is a surge in hospitalizations due to respiratory illnesses, including influenza, so health officials brace yearly for an increase in hospital visits. RELATED: Flu vs. common cold vs. COVID-19: Similar symptoms, many questions But health officials and researchers were baffled when they learned that seasonal influenza activity in the United States was drastically low and remains lower than usual for this time of year. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza at clinical laboratories was only 0.1% during the week ending Feb. 6. Meanwhile, only 1.1% of patients visited health care providers for the flu during the same timeframe, and all jurisdictions in the United States experienced minimal activity. In fact, only 0.2% tested positive for influenza cumulatively since Sept. 27 — around when flu season typically begins. FluSurv-NET reported 165 laboratory confirmed influenza hospitalizations between Oct. 1, 2020 and Feb. 6, 2021 for an overall hospitalization rate of just 0.6% per 100,000 population. "This is lower than average for this point in the season and lower than rates for any season since routine data collection began in 2005, including the low severity 2011-12 season," the CDC wrote. At this time last year, close to 100 times as many flu cases were identified from nearly the same number of tests. Flu activity maps were dotted with shades of red and orange — indicating heightened activity — but now the maps remain mainly green, marking low and minimal activity. "It’s very reassuring during this recent surge in COVID that we were spared the double impact of COVID plus influenza," Thomas said. Why are influenza cases significantly fewer than in years past? "What we’re asking is what’s different this year?" Thomas said. "There’s a lot of factors that go into it, but of course this year, we think that it’s because of COVID." "All the things that you do to protect yourself against COVID would also reduce the risk of getting influenza," Thomas explained. "So the obvious explanation is that there is less flu, because we are just being more careful." Thomas said those "careful" precautions include COVID-19 recommendations issued by the CDC — mask wearing, hand washing and social distancing. CDC: This season’s flu shot doesn’t match up with the most common strain circulating This year’s flu season started early and has been particularly severe, in large part due to the fact that the most prominent strain circulating is a type of influenza B, which doesn't usually present until later in the flu season. "Now we’re being more careful than ever because of COVID, and I think that’s dropping the influenza risk as well," Thomas said. Thomas said influenza rates remain low all across the country, regardless of whether some states have more or less restrictive coronavirus mandates put into place. While the pandemic has influenced the volume and manner by which flu cases are reported (i.e. a person may be less inclined to get checked for the flu during a pandemic), Thomas reiterates that it cannot be the only reason. "Overall, it’s such a dramatic difference, and the one thing we know is different this year than other years is COVID," Thomas said. "COVID gets the credit or the blame depending on how you look at it." RELATED: Flu rates down nationwide School closures also likely played a role, as early research suggests kids transmit the influenza virus better than they do COVID-19, Dr. Abisola Olulade, a family medicine physician in California, explained to FOX News. "Transmission of flu is harder than the transmission of coronavirus," Olulade said. "Mitigation measures were more limited in their ability to prevent people from getting COVID." Reduced socializing could be keeping flu out of homes The flu virus is known to spread more quickly in confined environments — especially when many individuals are indoors together. But the flu may not be finding its way into as many homes this year because people aren’t socializing as much outside their own households, Thomas said. "The difference is now we’re staying inside, but we’re staying inside with the same people for a couple weeks at a time," Thomas explained. "If no one goes out and gets it and brings it home, then being home is not a risk." Various studies are currently being done to research the pandemic’s affect on the flu. RELATED: Researchers to pay volunteers more than $3,000 to be deliberately infected with flu virus For example, the Seattle Flu Study is continuing its research in the 2020-2021 flu season with a commitment to investigating the overlap of the COVID-19 pandemic, seasonal influenza, and the transmission of other respiratory illnesses. According to The Atlantic, the research team has run 6,000 tests, and only two have come back positive. Could flu activity increase post-COVID-19 pandemic? While flu activity is currently low, Thomas said it could increase in the coming months, if we lessen the restrictions (staying at home, washing hands, etc.) that have seemingly contributed to low influenza rates. Thomas still stressed the importance of getting an influenza vaccine despite the lower risk at this time. "Influenza hasn’t gone away. It will for sure come back," Thomas said. "I am somewhat hopeful that things that we’ve learned societally will stick with us and that we’ll be safer in the future with all respiratory infections just by being a little more careful, knowing a little bit more about how these things are spread and washing our hands a bit more... I think all of those things will be lasting lessons that will help reduce the risk of all respiratory infections." As of Feb. 18, there had been over 27.8 million cases of COVID-19 in the United States. The virus had also claimed more than 490,000 lives, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. 2024 Election View More What 2024 election results are saying about AZ politics video What 2024 election results are saying about AZ politics AZ Republican David Schweikert wins reelection video Republican David Schweikert wins reelection in AZ ACLU sues to extend ballot curing deadline in AZ BREAKING NEWS Breaking news delivered fast By clicking Sign Up, I confirmthat I have read and agreeto the Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.

The Philadelphia Inquirer White violence and Black protests during the 1918 flu have a lesson for today By Kristen Rogers, CNN 10 minute read Published 3:19 AM EST, Tue February 16, 2021 Link Copied! CNN — Adella Bond fired her revolver outside her window into the South Philadelphia air, hoping to attract police as a mob of Irish American people gathered around her home to tell her she wasn’t welcome. Bond, a Black woman who was a municipal court probation officer, knew that racial conflicts unfolded in neighborhoods that had once belonged to only White people but were beginning to house Black people as they migrated from the South to the North during the Great Migration, said Kenneth Finkel, a professor in the department of history at Temple University in Philadelphia, and the author of “Insight Philadelphia: Historical Essays Illustrated.” Black people were seeking work, property ownership and refuge from Southern violence from 1916 to 1970, when ultimately millions of them traveled north for industrial employment available therebecause of the labor shortagesthat startedduring World War I — even during the 1918 influenza pandemic. Southern Black people sought those same features, as well as better quality of life, through World War II and afterward (although segregation and other obstacles persisted for a while). Bond knew that White people had welcomed a Black family to a nearby neighborhood by harassing them and burning their furniture in the street earlier that July. She was also aware that another woman of color had previously lived in the house on Ellsworth Street that Bond moved into on Wednesday, July 24, 1918 — so she supposed that the area may have been safer for Black people. The second time she walked down that street, however, she was stoned. The violence came to her front door two days later, when about 100 White men and boys surrounded her house on Friday, July 26. “I heard them talk about having guns, and I saw the guns and cartridges. At last a man came along with a baby in his arms,” Bond told her attorney on July 30, 1918, according to The Philadelphia Inquirer newspaper. “He handed the baby to a woman, took a rock and threw it. The rock went through my parlor window. I didn’t know what the mob would do next, and I fired my revolver from my upper window to call the police. A policeman came, but he wouldn’t try to cope with that mob alone, so he turned it into a riot call.” The rock thrower, who had been shot in the leg, was arrested and held without bail. Police arrested Bond for “inciting to riot,” and the events of that day precipitated a slew of racial conflicts and riots that constituted one of the most violent periods in Philadelphia’s history. Violence instigated by White people, violent police encounters and protests for racial justice were rampant in Philadelphia during the 1918 flu pandemic. George Floyd, a Black man from Minneapolis, was killed by a White policeman in May 2020. That killing and others by police led to the Black Lives Matter movement gaining momentum over the summer, in terms of national and global reach, numbers of protests and new supporters beyond Black communities. Despite the challenges Black Philadelphians faced in 1918, they, too, summoned the spirit needed to work toward change. The impact of these crowded race riots on the flu case and death rates in Philadelphia is unknown. The riots took place “during a lull between the first and second waves of the pandemic,” said Dr. Jeremy Brown, an emergency care physician and author of “Influenza: The Hundred-Year Hunt to Cure the Deadliest Disease in History,” via email. “As such, and during the continuing fighting during the great war in Europe, attention was surely focused on other issues. The riot was not a ‘superspreader’ event, because at the time there wasn’t much disease to be spread. That came back in the fall.” “We may not be able to establish casualty scientifically or historically between the outbreak of disease and the virus of racism, but we understand all too well that when we fear for our very lives, our mortality can shred our civility,” Brown said in an unpublished paper on the topic. “This dread exposes a primal panic that unleashes the violent human impulse to blame and hurt others in ways inexcusable. There are many lessons we’ve learned from looking at the history of pandemics, but some, regrettably, we never seem to take to heart.” Sources of the ire Philadelphia had the largest Black population of any Northern city in 1910, although African Americans were only 5% of the city’s population, said Charles Hardy, a professor of history at West Chester University of Pennsylvania. The Great Migration resulted in Black newcomers in White neighborhoods and housing shortages, to which realtors responded by increasing rent prices — effectively causing housing competition among Black and White people, and relocation by those who couldn’t afford the new prices. READ MORE: From the front lines, Black nurses battle twin pandemics of racism and coronavirus Bond moved into “a working class, tough Irish-American neighborhood,” Hardy said. “Philadelphia is historically known as the city of neighborhoods.” The boundaries of ethnically specific neighborhoods weren’t to be crossed then. Rather than blame the realtors, White residents harassed their new Black neighbors for their struggles and for not adhering to social codes in the segregated city. “The city’s a powder keg at this point in time,” Hardy said. Catching fire A city tense over war, the flu pandemic and race riots erupted as what started at Bond’s house that Friday night spread across about 2 square miles. Crowds of hundreds of rioters became thousands as the unrest escalated. “When things exploded,” Finkel said, “it went on for days. Every night was another chaotic mess.” On Saturday, a Black man named William Box was accused of thievery and chased by White men. A police bureau clerk tried to stop Box, who allegedly pulled a knife and cut the clerk’s arm. “Several policemen arrived on the scene, but were unable to curb the mob of whites and ‘the negro was struck many times by persons in the crowd,’” wrote Vincent P. Franklin, then an author and professor of history, in a 1975 paper on the race riots. Cries of “‘lynch him’” caused the police to send for help, “’and a squad of reserves arrived in time to prevent the mob doing serious injury to the negro,’” Franklin continued, quoting a Philadelphia Inquirer report. They arrested Box and took him to the hospital. The next morning, a White mob chased Jesse Butler as he walked home from a party. While running, Butler fired a shot into the mob and allegedly injured Hugh Lavery, a White man. Police who had arrived soon found that Butler was also wounded and took both men to the hospital, but Lavery died before their arrival. Hostility spread as groups of White people attacked Black people on their regular travels throughout Philadelphia. Civilians, as the Home Defense Reserves typically used for emergencies, assisted around 250 policemen in maintaining a riot zone near Bond’s neighborhood. Black people felt tension and concern over police brutality, Hardy said. “Philadelphia police forces were segregated, (and) most policemen were political appointees. … Then there’s this discriminatory enforcement of laws.” One of those was a type of stop-and-frisk practice. White patrolmen Roy Ramsey and John Schneider stopped a Black man, Riley Bullock, on an avenue and searched him on Monday. After finding a pocketknife Bullock legally carried, the patrolmen beat and arrested him. As they took Bullock into the station, hewas fatally shot in the back, Finkel said, by “a negro, who was seen making his escape. The police gave chase, but the alleged assailant managed to escape,” reported many local newspapers that ran the unsubstantiated story. The next day brought the revelation that Bullock was killed by a bullet from the gun of patrolman Ramsey — who claimed that he slipped and his gun fired when he was taking Bullock into the station. Bullock wasn’t the only victim of police violence. When Ramsey and Schneider arrested a Black man named Preston Lewis that morning, they beat him so severely that Lewis had to be taken to the hospital. As Lewis laid on the operating table, Schneider reportedly began striking him before ultimately being carried out of the room by White officers. Tuesday was calmer, but mobs tried to lynch a Black man for allegedly stealing a watermelon that day. “When it’s all done four days later, you’ve had several hundred people who were injured, four people dead,” Hardy said. The houses of dozens of Black families had been destroyed, forcing them to flee. And though White people had instigated most of the violence, the majority of the 60 people arrested were Black. “What you have in the early 1900s and today is rising nativism, White ethnocentrism and White supremacy,” Hardy said. “After World War I is when you witness the rebirth of the Ku Klux Klan which, in the 1920s, becomes a major political force. … The culture wars that we’re witnessing today are very much reminiscent of the culture wars in the 1920s. It’s basically fear of a White minority.” READ MORE: Fed study: 1918 flu deaths linked to relative strength of Nazism “There are chilling parallels between what we have seen in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic with the revelation of quite brutal police killings of African Americans and what actually happened back in 1918,” Brown said. “That story is a very sobering one — not least for which it reminds us that this kind of violence against the African American community is nothing new, sadly,” he said. “We know how long it’s been around, but when it comes to pandemics, it’s been around for well over a century.” Coming together to resist Many Black Philadelphians organized to prevent experiencing further violence, destruction and death at the hands of White people, Franklin wrote. Ministers and other prominent Black Philadelphians met and wrote a letter to the city’s director of public safety. In it, they castigated the police force over the lack of protection and arrests of Black people during the violence, Franklin wrote, quoting the letter as reprinted by local newspapers. In court, Black lawyers defended Black people who had been arrested during the riots. Black ministers and civic leaders formed the Association for the Protection of Colored People (or Colored Protective Association) in August, immediately gaining hundreds of members who worked and fundraised to represent prosecuted Black people and to support the civil rights of Black Philadelphians. The association was responsible for the prosecution of patrolman Ramsey for killing Bullock, and patrolman Schneider for assaulting Lewis, but neither of the men were convicted — partly due to fellow Black patrolmen backing down from testifying what they had really seen. Black Philadelphians did succeed in getting the commander and all members of the police force transferred out of the 17th District, where most of the rioting had occurred. “This event was hailed as a major victory for Philadelphia’s black community,” Franklin wrote. The association achieved mobilizing Black Philadelphians by informing them of their lawful civil rights, advising them on handling racial discrimination, giving speeches in churches and providing legal assistance for those who had been arrested or assaulted. When Black people made protests to government officials about violent White sailors, the commander of the Fourth Naval District investigated the situation, Franklin wrote. “When you look at Black Lives Matter demonstrations and the calls for police accountability and changes in police behavior,” Hardy said, “we can see a sort of predecessor to that in Philadelphia during the First World War.” “These were the more significant and graphic results of the organized efforts of blacks to improve their situation in the City of Brotherly Love in the aftermath of the July, 1918, riot,” Franklin wrote. Thoughts on history and hope The similarities between the race riots of 1918 and racial conflicts today emphasize the importance of knowing the truth, Finkel said. “It’s really important not to just pat ourselves on the back and move on and forget the ugly chapters. Those ugly chapters are very informative and useful and real.” READ MORE: For churchgoers during the Covid-19 pandemic, a deadly lesson from the 1918 flu The parallels also highlight that the movement toward racial equality is “one step forward, two steps back,” Hardy said. “We’ve gotten unprecedented numbers of people of color in political office on the state level,” he added. “We’ve got Kamala Harris as vice president. So, it’s a mixed bag. It’s just this ongoing struggle. Clearly White supremacy and nativism are very strong movements in the United States today. On the other hand, a movement towards greater racial and gender equality I think continues.” Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Sign in My Account Settings Topics You Follow Sign Out Your CNN account Sign in to your CNN account Live TV Listen Watch 2024 Elections US Crime + Justice World Africa Americas Asia Australia China Europe India Middle East United Kingdom Politics SCOTUS Congress Facts First 2024 Elections Business Tech Media Calculators Videos Markets Pre-markets After-Hours Fear & Greed Investing Markets Now Nightcap Health Life, But Better Fitness Food Sleep Mindfulness Relationships Entertainment Movies Television Celebrity Tech Innovate Foreseeable Future Mission: Ahead Work Transformed Innovative Cities Style Arts Design Fashion Architecture Luxury Beauty Video Travel Destinations Food & Drink Stay News Videos Sports Pro Football College Football Basketball Baseball Soccer Olympics Hockey Watch Live TV CNN Headlines CNN Shorts Shows A-Z CNN10 CNN Max CNN TV Schedules FlashDocs Listen CNN 5 Things Chasing Life with Dr. Sanjay Gupta The Assignment with Audie Cornish One Thing Tug of War CNN Political Briefing The Axe Files All There Is with Anderson Cooper All CNN Audio podcasts CNN Underscored Electronics Fashion Beauty Health & Fitness Home Reviews Deals Money Gifts Travel Outdoors Pets CNN Store Science Space Life Unearthed Climate Solutions Weather Weather Video Climate Ukraine-Russia War Israel-Hamas War About CNN Subscribe Photos Investigations CNN Profiles CNN Leadership CNN Newsletters Work for CNN Health Watch Listen Live TV Follow CNN Sign in My Account Settings Topics You Follow Sign Out Your CNN account Sign in to your CNN account Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ad Choices Accessibility & CC About Subscribe Newsletters Transcripts Help Center © 2024 Cable News Network.

The aim of this surveillance was to assess the quadrivalent inactivated split-virion influenza vaccine (IIV4) during routine immunization in Finland, as per the national immunization program for 2019/20. The primary objective was to investigate the suspected adverse drug reactions (ADR) occurring within 7 days following vaccination.MethodsPassive surveillance of individuals vaccinated with IIV4 was conducted within the first 4 to 6 weeks of the influenza season in Finland. Potential ADRs were reported via phone or posted adverse event forms. The vaccinee reporting rate and ADR reporting rate were calculated and compared with the known or expected safety data in order to identify any change which was clinically significant.ResultsData were collected from 939 individuals, with 56 reports received for 163 suspected ADRs. Of these, 38 individuals reported 117 suspected ADRs within 7 days following vaccination, corresponding to an ADR reporting rate of 12.46% (95% CI: 10.41, 14.74%); vaccination-site pain, vaccination-site reaction, and pyrexia were the most frequently reported ADRs. The 18-to-65 years of age category had an ADR reporting rate of 12.56%, the over-65 years of age category had an ADR reporting rate of 16.22%, and no ADRs were reported for individuals aged 6 months to 18 years. No serious suspected ADRs were reported at any time post-vaccination, and the ADR rates were comparable to those reported for IIV4 in the 2018/19 seasonal assessment. The frequency of suspected ADRs was generally aligned with those reported in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC), with the exception of asthenia, somnolence, and erythema, which were slightly higher. No reporting pattern by type, frequency, or severity was identified for the suspected ADRs.ConclusionsNo clinically significant changes in what is known or expected for IIV4 was reported for the 2019/20 season, which supports the overall safety profile. Peer Review reports IntroductionInfluenza viruses are constantly evolving, and due to this antigenic drift, immunity as a result of prior infections or vaccinations does not provide lasting protection against the virus, which results in seasonal epidemics [1] and necessitates annual update of the vaccine strains and annual vaccination [2]. Therefore, conducting annual safety surveillance on seasonal influenza vaccines is important, and a requirement for the EMA. The safety surveillance enables rapid detection of adverse events (AE), identifying any significant change in frequency or severity of expected reactogenicity or allergic events that could be intrinsic to the vaccine, prior to widespread use of the vaccine in any particular year [3]. Enhanced Passive Safety Surveillance (EPSS) is one of the surveillance methods used for monitoring ADRs [3]. The use of a passive surveillance system in combination with physician reporting of ADRs has been shown to improve the rates of AE reporting [4, 5].In 2016, a quadrivalent inactivated split-virion influenza vaccine (IIV4; Vaxigrip Tetra®, Sanofi Pasteur) was licensed in the European Union (EU) for use in adults and children from 6 months of age, offering broad protection against influenza through the inclusion of two influenza A and two influenza B virus strains [6]. An EPSS conducted in the northern hemisphere (NH) 2017/18 influenza season assessed the ADR rates for a trivalent split-virion inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV3; Vaxigrip Tetra®, Sanofi Pasteur), an intradermally administered IIV3 (IIV3-ID; Intanza® 15 μg, Sanofi Pasteur) and IIV4, demonstrating consistent safety findings [7]. Therefore, this current surveillance aims to address the requirements of the EPSS for IIV4 during routine immunization, as per the national immunization program in Finland for the influenza season 2019/20.MethodsStudy design, population, and settingBetween October 4, 2019 and November 26, 2019 an EPSS was conducted to examine ADRs associated with the IIV4 vaccination within eight participating sites in Finland. The EPSS current interim guidance for seasonal influenza vaccines in the EU recommends a system able to detect ADR normally expected to be common (ie, with a frequency ≥ 1%) and allows the vaccinee or their carer to report on any AEs [3, 6]. Consequently, this surveillance aimed to include 1000 people 6 months of age or older who had received IIV4 from their healthcare professional (HCP) within 4 to 6 weeks following the start of the influenza vaccination season. This population size provided a > 99% probability of collecting ≥1 report of a common AE, which could be a proxy for more severe reactions.Vaccine formulationThe IIV4 vaccine contained 15 μg hemagglutinin per strain of: A/Brisbane/02/2018 (H1N1)pdm09-like strain (A/Brisbane/02/2018, IVR-190); A/Kansas/14/2017 (H3N2)-like strain (A/Kansas/14/2017, NYMC X-327); B/Colorado/06/2017-like strain (B/Maryland/15/2016, NYMC BX-69A); B/Phuket/3073/2013-like strain (B/Phuket/3073/2013, wild type) within a 0.5 mL dose. All strains were propagated in fertilized chicken eggs from healthy chicken flocks [6].EndpointsThe primary endpoint was the suspected ADRs occurring within 7 days following routine vaccination with IIV4, during the NH 2019/20 influenza season. Secondary endpoints included: suspected ADRs occurring within 7 days following routine vaccination with IIV4, according to the pre-defined age groups, and serious suspected ADRs after vaccination with IIV4 at any time following vaccination. Each of these endpoints were summarized as estimated reporting rates. The reporting rates of suspected ADRs observed during NH influenza season 2019/20 was compared with reporting rates of suspected ADRs observed in NH influenza season 2018/19 for IIV4 vaccines (which was conducted with the same EPSS design), and with frequencies documented in the SmPC.An exploratory endpoint was included, assessing any potential safety signal(s) detected during the weekly EPSS data review. Safety signals included any reaction which could be causally linked to vaccine exposure and has not previously been known or documented, which could affect the health of the vaccinee [8]. These were evaluated during a weekly cumulative review of all EPSS reported cases, as per the internal Sanofi Pasteur routing pharmacovigilance process.Study conduct and data collectionThe HCPs were selected from private practices (one main site and seven satellite sites) before the influenza season based on their potential use of the IIV4 vaccine, their influenza vaccination capacities, and estimated representation of all age groups in the routine vaccination population. Vaccination information was recorded by the HCP in real time (or on the same day), in a web portal using the electronic data capture system. Since vaccination followed routine practice, and the goal of an EPSS is to generate data as early as possible, the first 1000 people were enrolled, and no enrollment quota were used.Any individual receiving IIV4 at the participating sites was given instructions by the HCP to report any suspected ADR, especially those occurring within 7 days of having received the vaccine, either by telephone or postal service. To aid this reporting, vaccinees (or their parent/guardian) received a vaccination card (VC) with the unique vaccine identification number and contact details for ADR reporting by telephone (Sanofi Pasteur Pharmacovigilance [PV] Department), as well as an adverse event form containing general information to fill out regarding a possible ADR (as per routine PV process). The form contained pre-specified outcomes, as well as a free text section in which the ADRs were reported to ensure all relevant data were captured. If completed, this was to be sent to Sanofi Pasteur by post with the pre-paid envelope provided. Due to the nature of the reporting form being free-text, the ADR have been reported verbatim, and no formal definitions have been applied to define particular events.Data collection and processing for ADRs was conducted by the Sanofi Pasteur PV Department. Verbatim ADRs were entered in the PV database, coded with Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terminology (version 22.1), and processed according to routine PV processes. Vaccine coverage, as well as suspected ADR reporting data, was evaluated on a weekly basis for signal detection purposes by Sanofi Pasteur. Any ADR recognized as being of interest was analyzed separately as the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) ADR. The PRAC ADR of interest are those ADR which are usually solicited within influenza vaccination clinical trials [3], and so rates may be compared with the ADR rates listed within the SmPC. Reports received outside the EPSS period were handled as routine spontaneous reports but were not included in the analysis.Statistical methodsDescriptive statistics were used to summarize the data, including the vaccine reporting rate and ADR reporting rate, with associated two-sided 95% confidence intervals (CI). The vaccine reporting rate (number of vaccinees who reported at least one suspected ADR divided by the total number of VCs distributed) and ADR reporting rate (number of suspected ADRs divided by the total number of VCs distributed) were generated in order to identify a clinically significant change, compared with the known or expected safety data.Data were summarized cumulatively by age group, separated by ADRs occurring ≤7 or > 7 days after vaccination, as well as by seriousness and severity. Potential reactogenicity was assessed by comparing the previous reporting rates obtained in the EPSS NH influenza season 2018/19 and the reporting rates recorded in the SmPC (as per clinical trial findings), with the reporting rates observed in the current EPSS NH influenza season 2019/20. Any observed reporting rates that were higher than the upper limit of the 95% CI of the previous year’s estimate were considered significantly higher.ResultsData were collected from 939 individuals vaccinated with IIV4 over the course of 2 months. In total, 56 reports were received for 163 suspected ADRs. The overall vaccinee reporting rate was 5.96% (95% CI: 4.45, 7.48%) and the overall ADR reporting rate was 17.36% (95% CI: 14.99, 19.94%). The time to ADR onset was known for 117 (71.78%) ADRs, and the duration of ADR was known for 79 (48.47%) of the 163 ADRs reported.For the primary endpoint, 38 people who received the IIV4 vaccine reported 117 suspected ADRs within 7 days following vaccination (Table 1). This corresponds to an ADR reporting rate of 12.46% (95% CI: 10.41, 14.74%). Of the 117 suspected ADRs, 87.18% (102/117) occurred on the same day or the day following vaccination, and none of the ADRs with known duration were reported as having occurred more than 7 days after vaccination. Of the 79 ADRs with known duration, 81.01% (64/79) were resolved within 3 or fewer days, and 18.99% (15/79) resolved within 4 to 7 days. The most frequently reported ADRs from Day 1 were vaccination-site pain, vaccination-site reaction, and pyrexia; and at Day 7, influenza, pyrexia, and vaccination-site erythema. Table 1 Adverse drug reaction rates stratified by age, reported within 7 days of vaccinationFull size tableThe PRAC ADRs of interest accounted for 112 of the 163 ADRs reported (68.71%) and were included in 56 reports. The most frequently reported PRAC ADRs of interest were vaccination-site pain with 27 events (2.88% [95% CI: 1.81, 3.94%]) included in 27 reports, myalgia with nine events (0.96% [95% CI: 0.34, 1.58%]) included in nine reports, and pyrexia and vaccination-site erythema, which both had six events (0.64% [95% CI: 0.13, 1.15%]) included in six reports.Assessing the secondary endpoints, separating the ADR rates by age group, the ADR rate within 7 days of vaccination for the 18-to-65 years of age category was 12.56% (95% CI: 10.44, 14.92%), and 16.22% (95% CI: 6.19, 32.01%) for the over-65 years of age group. No ADRs were reported for children aged 6 months to 18 years of age. No serious suspected ADRs were reported at any point post-vaccination. All reported suspected ADRs for the NH influenza season 2019/20 were classified as either mild (79, 8.41% [95% CI: 6.72, 10.38%]), moderate (42, 4.47% [95% CI: 3.24, 6.00%]), or unknown (42, 4.47% [95% CI: 3.24, 6.00%]). None of the suspected ADRs reported were specifically classified as severe.Table 2 shows the comparison of the NH 2018/19 influenza season with the NH 2019/20 influenza season; the overall vaccinee reporting rate for this surveillance (5.96% [95% CI: 4.45, 7.48%]) was found to be similar to the previous season’s rate (5.3% [95% CI: 3.93, 6.71%]. The ADR reporting rate was also similar between this surveillance (17.36% [95% CI: 14.99, 19.94%]) and the previous season’s (16.3% [95% CI: 14.03, 18.71%]). Of note, vaccinee reporting rates for injection-site reactions, a PRAC ADR of interest, were higher in this surveillance (5.54% [95% CI: 4.07, 7.00%]) than for the 2018/19 season (3.6% [95% CI: 2.45, 4.77%]). Table 2 Comparison of reporting rates for all suspected adverse drug reactions between northern hemisphere influenza season 2018/19 and northern hemisphere influenza season 2019/20Full size tableComparing the frequency of suspected ADRs reported in the NH influenza 2019/20 season with the ADR recorded in the SmPC (Table 3), the rates of asthenia, somnolence, and erythema were slightly above the frequency provided in the SmPC (> 0.1% for all three ADRs vs > 0.01 to < 0.1% for the SmPC, respectively). All other listed ADRs were below or within the expected reporting frequencies. The safety analysis of suspected ADRs did not identify any reporting pattern by type, frequency, or severity. Table 3 Comparison of reporting rates for all suspected adverse drug reactions in the 2019/2020 enhanced passive safety surveillance with the reporting rates recorded in the Summary of Product CharacteristicsFull size tableNo safety signals were detected during the EPSS, therefore the safety signals per batch were not assessed for the exploratory endpoint. In addition, the same batch of vaccine was provided to 938 of the 939 individuals.DiscussionSince 2014, the EMA has required annual enhanced safety surveillance monitoring for seasonal influenza vaccines, replacing the small-scale safety and immunogenicity clinical trials previously required from the manufacturers of seasonal influenza vaccines [3, 9]. This EPSS assessed the safety of the IIV4 vaccine at the start of the influenza season 2019/20 in Finland. For the primary EPSS analysis, the ADRs reported within 7 days of vaccination were as expected, with no novel AE detected. The most common ADR reported was vaccination-site pain. The majority of the ADRs were reported within 3 days of vaccination and most were resolved within 3 days. As expected, no serious or severe findings were reported at any stage post-vaccination, the ADRs reported were comparable to those reported in the previous 2018/19 season, and they were in line with what had been reported in the SmPC (with the exception of slight increases compared with the SmPC recorded frequency of asthenia, somnolence, and erythema).EPSS is advantageous in that it provides a near real-time evaluation of the reactogenicity or allergic events of a seasonal influenza vaccine following annual strain changes, which could indicate more potentially serious risks as the vaccination uptake increases [3]. However, there are challenges associated with this reporting method. Recruiting sufficient participants within the month-long surveillance to accommodate the EPSS requirements is one example. Variations in the surveillance conduct (different countries and changes in the reporting methods) can make examining ADR rates across different years less comparable as well. In addition, the nature of passive reporting does not allow for any control over the timing of ADR reporting, or whether an ADR is reported or not (making under-reporting a possibility).The 2017/18 IIV4 EPSS reported injection-site reactions, headaches, and fever as the most common adverse reactions, and no safety issues were previously observed for IIV4, which is in line with findings from this current surveillance [7]. The rate of AEs was 2.1%, lower than the rate reported in this current surveillance; however, that may be due to the phone reporting methods previously used [7]. Compared with the 2019/20 surveillance, the reporting rates for the 2018/19 season were similar for both the vaccinee reporting rate (6.0% vs 5.3%), and the ADR reporting rate (17.4% vs 16.3%). Using a combination of posted forms and phone reporting within this surveillance was expected to provide better quality reporting than using a method such as email reporting alone, as instructions had been given to the vaccinee to assist them in completing the necessary information for reporting. The rates of spontaneous reporting in this current surveillance (6.0%) were higher than expected, a distinct advantage of this method, and in line with what has been demonstrated in previous passive surveillance studies [4, 5]. This increased rate of reporting, compared with normal spontaneous reporting, is likely due to HCPs increasing awareness in the vaccinees of the importance of suspected ADR reporting.Limitations of the surveillance include the reduced population size, which was below the intended 1000 individuals, and fewer individuals over 65 years of age than expected, most likely due to competition with an alternate surveillance. Additionally, the majority of sites were private clinics, which may have impacted recruitment for the surveillance. This is likely also the reason for the demographic imbalance in the participant population (with a higher proportion of participants between 18 and 65 years of age). This imbalance was expected as the majority of the sites, being private clinics, were frequented by individuals of working age. As specified within the national vaccination program in Finland, influenza vaccines are freely administered only at public health clinics to those for whom influenza is an essential health risk or those who gain significant benefit from it, including pregnant women, children 7 years of age or younger, and adults 65 years of age and over. The inclusion of all children under 7 years of age, as well as all adults over 65 years of age within the national vaccination program may further explain the lower proportion of these age groups within the surveillance, as they may be more likely to get a free vaccination from a public health clinic instead. While IIV3 is available to all age groups, nasal spray vaccination is also available for children between 24 months and 5 years of age [10]. The use of nasal spray vaccination with live attenuated virus has risen in this age group, compared with IIV3, as demonstrated with a study assessing vaccination rates in 2-year old children in Finland, which showed that 20% of the cohort were vaccinated with the nasal spray vaccine in 2016–2017, followed by 22% in the 2017–2018 period; whereas 8% of children were vaccinated with IIV3 in the 2016–2017 period and 9% received IIV3 in 2017–2018 [11]. The increasing use of the nasal spray vaccine may further explain the lower proportion of children enrolled for vaccination with IIV4 within this surveillance. To this effect, conducting future EPSS within public practice may provide a cohort of vaccinees of all age groups, instead of primarily including the working age demographic. In this surveillance, all but one individual received a vaccine from the same batch, limiting the ability to investigate the safety across multiple batches.The inconvenience of returning the adverse event form via post does mean some ADRs could have been missed, and postal strikes in Finland also had an impact on data collection, with post delayed up to 2 weeks. A shortage of the vaccine also resulted in a delay to the start of the campaign. Due to these impediments, enrolment was extended by 1 week, and data collection was extended by a further 2 weeks. Digital reporting and structured questionnaires may increase rates of reporting for future studies.While passive reporting appears to have been advantageous in this surveillance, with a good rate of ADR reporting, there is generally a lack of control with both the level and timing of passive reporting. The self-reporting nature of the surveillance also meant that none of the suspected ADRs were confirmed by a medical professional, and should any of the ADRs have been complicated in nature, obtaining further detail would have proven difficult. As well as under-reporting, differential ADR reporting (where more serious ADRs and ADRs with a shorter time onset after vaccination are more likely to be reported than minor ADRs) was also a possibility in this surveillance.In conclusion, the 2019/20 EPSS results did not suggest any clinically significant change in what is known or expected for IIV4, which supports the safety profile of this vaccine and continues to maintain public confidence in influenza vaccination. Changes in the adverse event form distribution method improved the quality of the data reported by the patients compared with the last season, allowing for a better assessment of the reported cases, and contributed to increased reporting. Other improvements, including digital strategies, might further improve both the quality of the data and the reporting stimulation in the future.

Influenza A virus contains an ion channel protein M2 conserved extracellular domain (M2e), a target for developing universal vaccines. Here we generated reassortant influenza virus rgH3N2 4xM2e virus (HA and NA from A/Switzerland/9715293/2013/(H3N2)) expressing chimeric 4xM2e-HA fusion proteins with 4xM2e epitopes inserted into the H3 HA N-terminus. Recombinant rgH3N2 4xM2e virus was found to retain equivalent growth kinetics as rgH3N2 in egg substrates. Intranasal single inoculation of mice with live rgH3N2 4xM2e virus was effective in priming the induction of M2e specific IgG antibody responses in mucosal and systemic sites as well as T cell responses. The rgH3N2 4xM2e primed mice were protected against a broad range of different influenza A virus subtypes including H1N1, H3N2, H5N1, H7N9, and H9N2. The findings support a new approach to improve the efficacy of current vaccine platforms by recombinant influenza virus inducing immunity to HA and cross protective M2e antigens.

Influenza A virus is a negative-sense single-stranded RNA virus containing 8 segmented genomes, belonging to the Orthomyxoviridae family, and has an antigenic variety from 18 subtypes (H1–H18) of hemagglutinin (HA) and 11 subtypes (N1–N11) of neuraminidase (NA)3. Antigenic diversity is a challenging difficulty in preventing influenza. Vaccination has been the most effective preventive measure against influenza virus infection. The most common licensed platforms are inactivated influenza and live-attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIV).The overall vaccine effectiveness during 2005–2018 seasons is a wide range of low efficacy between 10 and 60% as estimated in the US Flu Vaccine Effectiveness Network4. Due to emergence of drifting mutations in circulating H3N2 strains, the vaccine effectiveness against H3N2 was estimated to be 6% during the 2014–2015 season5,6. To overcome continued antigenic changes, universal vaccination strategies have been focused on inducing immunity to conserved epitopes and domains present in all influenza A viruses, including the M2 extracellular domain epitopes (M2e)7,8 and the HA stalk domains9,10.Different platforms and vaccine adjuvants have been investigated to overcome low immunogenicity of M2e epitopes. M2e-based vaccine candidates include Hepatitis B virus core protein conjugates (M2e-HBc) with adjuvants11,12, virus-like particles (VLP) presenting M2e tandem repeats (5xM2e VLP)13, and flagellin conjugates (4.M2e-tFliC)14 and fusion with oligomer stabilizing domains (M2e-tGCN4)15. M2e expressing viral vectored vaccines were reported using adenovirus16, modified vaccinia virus Ankara17, and a T7-bacteriophage18. These previous strategies inducing M2e immunity alone were insufficient for conferring optimum protection and incompatible with current vaccine platforms. No universal vaccine against influenza is on the market.Vaccination of combined M2e VLP and inactivated influenza vaccines induced both cross protective M2e and strain specific HA immunity19,20. To enhance the cross protective efficacy by a strategy of utilizing current vaccine platforms, recombinant influenza H1N1 virus A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (A/PR8) was engineered to express chimeric 4xM2e-HA where tandem M2e epitopes were inserted in the N-terminus HA21. A chimeric HA with a single M2e in the head site Ca was tested in inactivated recombinant A/PR8 virus inducing cross protection22. However, the protection was not tested against a wide range of different subtypes.In recent years, antigenic drifts have severely limited the effectiveness of the H3N2 component of seasonal influenza vaccines. Here, using the reverse genetic (rg) technique, we generated reassortant seasonal influenza rgH3N2 4xM2e virus containing chimeric 4xM2e-HA in which the HA and NA genes were derived from A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 (H3N2) and the remaining 6 genes from the A/PR8 backbone. Reassortant rgH3N2 4xM2e virus containing chimeric 4xM2e-HA was found to retain comparable growth properties but display highly attenuated phenotypes in mice. Intranasal single inoculation of mice with rgH3N2 4xM2e virus could effectively induce a broad range of enhanced cross protection against different influenza A virus subtypes including H1N1, H3N2, H5N1, H7N9, and H9N2. This study implicates a strategy of improving cross protection by utilizing currently licensed recombinant influenza vaccine platforms.ResultsGeneration of reassortant influenza H3N2 virus vaccine containing 4xM2e in an HA conjugateCurrent strain specific HA-based influenza vaccine is less effective in conferring cross protection. M2e has been targeted to induce broad but weak cross protection. To induce immunity against both HA and highly conserved M2e epitopes, a seasonal A/Switzerland/2013 H3 HA gene conjugated with four tandem M2e (4xM2e) repeat was constructed (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table S1). Rescued viruses expressing wild type (WT) HA (rgH3N2) or chimeric HA (rgH3N2 4xM2e) were amplified in eggs and harvested. Antigenic characterization by ELISA showed that rgH3N2 4xM2e virus was highly reactive to M2e specific mAb 14C2 whereas rgH3N2 and A/PR8 virus controls did not show such M2e reactivity (Fig. 1b). Both rgH3N2 and rgH3N2 4xM2e viruses displayed high antigenic reactivity to mouse antisera of rgH3N2 infection and goat antisera of A/Indiana/2011 (H3N2) immunization (Supplementary Fig. S1). These results support that 6:2 reassortant rgH3N2 4xM2e virus displays high reactivity to M2e specific 14C2 mAb and retains similar antigenicity to antisera of H3N2 viruses as compared to rgH3N2 virus.Figure 1Reassortants rgH3N2 and rgH3N2 4xM2e virus expressing chimeric 4xM2e-HA are attenuated in vivo.

(f) Body weight changes in BALB/c mice (n = 10, too small variations to be shown) IN inoculated with reassortant rgH3N2 viruses (105–106 EID50) or A/PR8 (104 EID50). (g) Infectious virus titers (EID50) in nasal turbinates and lung extracts from mice (n = 3, pooled) at 3-day post infection with A/PR8 (104 EID50), rgH3N2 (106 EID50) and rgH3N2 4xM2e (106 EID50).Full size imageReassortant rgH3N2 4xM2e virus is attenuated in mice but does not compromise replication capacity in egg substratesWe determined whether rgH3N2 4xM2e virus would retain the comparable replication capacity in egg substrates, compared to WT rgH3N2. Both chimeric rgH3N2 4xM2e and WT rgH3N2 viruses displayed similarly high levels of egg infectious titers (EID50/ml) and hemagglutination activity units (HAU) (Fig. 1c,d). Next, at designated time points after incubation of embryonated chicken eggs with 104 EID50 of rgH3N2 or rgH3N2 4xM2e, in vitro growth kinetics of infectious titers (EID50) were determined (Fig. 1e). The results showed that rgH3N2 4xM2e virus exhibited an approximately equivalent growth kinetics in egg substrates as WT rgH3N2 virus. The reassortant rgH3N2 4xM2e virus does not compromise replication capacity in egg substrates. Consistent, the overall trends in the growth patterns of rgH3N2 and rgH3N2 4xM2 reassortants in MDCK cells were similarly observed as those in the eggs despite some variations at different culture times and temperatures (Supplementary Fig. S2).As an indicator of pathogenicity, weight changes and activity were monitored in mice after intranasal inoculation with rgH3N2 4xM2e and rgH3N2 viruses. Both mouse groups infected with rgH3N2 (105 EID50) and rgH3N2 4xM2e (105 and 106 EID50) did not show body weight loss (Fig. 1f) while the mice with A/PR8 even at a 100-fold lower dose (104 EID50) consistently displayed severe weight loss and died of infection. Consistent, mice inoculated with WT A/PR8 virus showed highest levels of replicating viral titers in the lower respiratory tracts of lungs, which is at approximately 100 folds higher than those in the upper respiratory nasal turbinates at day 3 post inoculation (104 EID50) (Fig. 1g). In contrast, rgH3N2 (106 EID50) and rgH3N2 4xM2e (106 EID50) viruses showed approximately 105 magnitudes lower lung viral titers than WT A/PR8 virus (Fig. 1g). Instead, 100 folds higher viral replications were observed in the nasal turbinates than those in the lungs after inoculation of mice with rgH3N2 and rgH3N2 4xM2e virus (Fig. 1g). Consistent with the differences in viral titers between in the upper (nasal) and lower (lung) respiratory tracts, virus growths of reassortants at 33 °C MDCK cell cultures were 1 to 2 log10 magnitudes higher than those at 37 °C MDCK cell cultures (Supplementary Fig. S2). These results suggest that reassortant rgH3N2 and chimeric rgH3N2 4xM2e viruses are highly attenuated in mice with restricted replication in the upper respiratory tracts but retains replication capacity in egg or MDCK cell substrates.Prime dose of live rgH3N2 4xM2e virus induces M2e specific IgG isotype antibody responsesIntranasal prime inoculation of mice with live rgH3N2 4xM2e virus (105 EID50) induced M2e specific IgG1 and IgG2a antibody responses at significantly higher levels than rgH3N2 (Fig. 2a,b). IgG antibodies specific for human M2e were induced at higher levels in prime sera from rgH3N2 4xM2e vaccination than those specific for avian M2e or swine M2e (Supplementary Fig. S3a), suggesting possible contribution of the extra 2 × hM2e in the rgH3N2 4xM2e construct. Both rgH3N2 and rgH3N2 4xM2e immunized groups showed similarly high levels of IgG isotype antibodies specific for H3N2 virus (Fig. 2c,d). Both sera from rgH3N2 and rgH3N2 4xM2e immune mice exhibited vaccine strain specific HAI activities against rgH3N2 (A/Switzerland) virus (Fig. 2e) but not against A/PR8 (H1N1), A/Philippines (A/Phil H3N2) and A/Vietnam (A/Viet rgH5N1). Therefore, prime dose of live rgH3N2 4xM2e but not rgH3N2 virus could induce M2e specific IgG isotype antibodies in mice.Figure 2Intranasal prime inoculation of live rgH3N2 4xM2e virus induces M2e specific serum IgG isotype antibody responses. (a) M2e specific IgG1 antibodies. (b) M2e specific IgG2a antibodies. (c, d) Virus rgH3N2 specific IgG1 and IgG2a antibodies. Serum samples were collected at 2 weeks after prime dose intranasal inoculation of mice (n = 15 /group). (e) Serum HAI titers against the viruses (A/PR8, A/Phil, rgH3N2 and A/Viet) were determined 14 days after immunization. rgH3N2: 6:2 reassortant with WT HA and NA of A/Switzerland/2013. rgH3N2 4xM2e: 6:2 reassortant with 4XM2e-HA and NA of A/Switzerland/2013. Each individual mouse animal is analyzed. Error bars indicate mean ± SEM.Full size imagePrime dose of live rgH3N2 4xM2e vaccination provides broad cross protectionIntranasally prime vaccinated mice with 105 EID50 of rgH3N2 or rgH3N2 4xM2e were challenged with different subtype influenza viruses including H1N1 (A/PR8), rgPR8 with avian M2 (rgPR8 Mm, rgPR8 Mg), H3N2 (A/Phil), rgH5N1 (A/Viet), rgH7N9 (A/Shanghai), and rgH9N2 (A/Hong Kong). The rgH3N2 4xM2e group showed higher survival rates (100%) and a trend of less weight loss against A/PR8 challenge, compared to the rgH3N2 group with 60% survival rates (Fig. 3a,e). Next, we tested PR8 reassortants containing avian M2 (rgPR8 Mm, rgPR8 Mg, Supplementary Fig. S4a, b, d, e) as a challenge virus, following single-dose vaccination with rgH3N2 or rgH3N2 4xM2e. A trend of less weight loss against rgPR8 Mm (M gene from A/Mandarin duck/Korea/PSC24-24/2010, H5N1) or rgPR8 Mg (M gene from A/Chicken/Korea/Gimje/2008, H5N1) was observed in the rgH3N2 4xM2e group, compared to those in the rgH3N2 control group. When challenged with a wild type 2009 H1N1 pandemic A/California/04/09 virus containing swine M2, the rgH3N2 4xM2e primed mice showed a pattern of less weight loss and quicker recovery than the rgH3N2 group (Supplementary Fig. S5). However, these difference between these two groups were not statistically significant.Figure 3A single dose of live rgH3N2 4xM2e virus provides enhanced heterosubtypic cross protection against different subtype influenza A viruses. Weight changes and survival rates in primed mice after challenge with (a, e) H1N1 A/PR8 (3 LD50), (b, f) rgH5N1 A/Vietnam (5 LD50), (c, g) rgH7N9 virus (reassortant A/Shanghai, 6 LD50) and (d, h) rgH9N2 virus (reassortant A/Hong Kong, 20 LD50). Differential challenge doses were used depending on the pathogenicity and HA phylogenic distance of virus. Groups of mice (n = 5 or 6) were intranasally primed with rgH3N2 (105 EID50) or rgH3N2 4xM2e (105 EID50) and then challenged 3 weeks later. Two independent repeat of mouse challenge experiments confirms the reproducibility of data. rgH3N2: 6:2 reassortant with WT HA and NA of A/Switzerland/2013. rgH3N2 4xM2e: 6:2 reassortant with 4XM2e-HA and NA of A/Switzerland/2013. Each individual mouse animal is analyzed. Error bars show mean ± SEM. The statistical significances between rgH3N2 group versus rgH3N2 4xM2e group were determined using two-way ANOVA and indicated in *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001.Full size imageTo test the breadth of cross protection, different subtypes of PR8 reassortants were used as a challenge virus. The rgH3N2 4xM2e primed mice exhibited significantly less weight loss (~ 5%) than rgH3N2 primed mice (~ 16%) at day 5 after challenge with rgH5N1 (Fig. 3b,f). Similarly, when challenged with rgH7N9 virus, the rgH3N2 4xM2e group displayed average weight loss 6% compared to 19% weight loss in rgH3N2 prime mice and the mock control with over 20% weight loss and 0% survival rates (Fig. 3c,g). After a high lethal dose (100 LD50) challenge with rgH9N2 virus, rgH3N2 4xM2e primed mice showed 75% survival protection whereas rgH3N2 immune and mock control mice all died of infection (Supplementary Fig. S4c, f). When challenged with rgH9N2 at 20 LD50 dose, rgH3N2 4xM2e primed mice showed better protection as evidenced by significantly preventing weight loss (average 11% day 6) and enhancing survival rates than rgH3N2 immune mice displaying 25% weight loss (day 6) and 25% survival rates (Fig. 3d,h).After challenge with A/Phil (H3N2), 3% weight loss was observed with rgH3N2 4xM2e primed mice in contrast to 12% weight loss was observed with rgH3N2 primed mice (Fig. 4a). Collectively, these results suggest that single dose intranasal priming of mice with rgH3N2 4xM2e could provide enhanced cross protection against diverse subtypes of influenza A viruses containing human or avian M2.Figure 4Prime dose rgH3N2 4xM2e provides enhanced protection against heterologous H3N2 A/Phil virus and M2e specific IgG and IgA antibodies in mucosal sites. The mice primed with rgH3N2 or rgH3N2 4xM2e were challenged with heterologous A/Phil H3N2 virus (50 LD50). A relatively high challenge dose was used because of the same subtype virus.

Error bars indicate mean value ± SEM. The statistical significances between rgH3N2 group versus rgH3N2 4xM2e group were determined using two-way ANOVA (a, c–e) or one-way ANOVA (b) and indicated in *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001.Full size imagePriming with rgH3N2 4xM2e virus results in enhanced responses of M2e specific IgG and IgA antibodies in mucosal respiratory and systemic sites upon challengeConsistently, the mice that received a single dose (105 EID50) of rgH3N2 4xM2e showed more effective cross protection against A/Phil H3N2 virus as evidenced by less weight loss compared to the mice with rgH3N2 (Fig. 4a). At day 5 post infection with A/Phil, naive mice showed the highest levels of lung virus titers (~ 106 TCID50) as determined in MDCK cells (Fig. 4b). Approximately 100 folds lower lung viral titers (8 × 103 TCID50) were observed in the rgH3N2 group than those in naïve mice, which are approximately 3.5-fold higher titers than those (2.3 × 103 TCID50) in the rgH3N2 4xM2e group (Fig. 4b). There was no statistical significance in lung viral titers between the rgH3N2 and rgH3N2 4xM2e group (Fig. 4b) and a similar pattern of viral titers was detected when determined by EID50 in egg substrates.Significantly higher levels of M2e specific IgG (Fig. 4c,e) and IgA (Fig. 4d,f) antibodies were induced in BALF (Fig. 4c,d) and lung extracts (Fig. 4e,f) from the rgH3N2 4xM2e group compared to the rgH3N2 group at 5 days after infection with A/Phil. Meanwhile, virus (rgH3N2, A/Phil) specific IgG and IgA antibodies were similarly induced in BALF and lung extracts at high levels in the both rgH3N2 4xM2e and rgH3N2 groups (Fig. 4c–f).We determined recall immune responses by measuring M2e and virus specific IgG at day 5 or 7 post challenge with heterologous A/Phil virus (Fig. 5). The rgH3N2 4xM2e primed mice showed significantly increased M2e specific IgG levels in sera (threefold in OD values) and draining lymph nodes MLN after challenge (Fig. 5a,d) while the other groups did not. The increased IgG levels specific for vaccine rgH3N2 (Fig. 5b) and challenge virus A/Phil (Fig. 5c) were similarly observed in post-challenge sera from both groups. Intracellular cytokine staining results indicate the induction of M2e-stimulated CD4 T cells secreting IFN-γ at high frequencies (Fig. 5e,f) and relatively low numbers of IFN-γ+ CD8 T cells (Supplementary Fig. S6) in BALF and lung cells from the rgH3N2 4xM2e primed mice. These results suggest that the levels of M2e specific antibodies and T cell immunity induced by priming rgH3N2 4xM2e in mucosal (BALF, lungs) and systemic (sera, MLN) sites might have contributed to cross-protection.Figure 5Single inoculation of rgH3N2 4xM2e virus effectively primes M2e and virus specific immune responses. Sera after rgH3N2 or rgH3N2 4xM2e immunization (day 14) and challenge with A/Phil H3N2 virus (50 LD50, day7) were collected respectively to determine IgG antibody response specific for (a) M2e (1:100 sera), (b) rgH3N2 (1:10,000 sera), and (c) A/Phil (H3N2) (1:10,000 sera) antigens. (d) In vitro production of M2e, rgH3N2, and A/Phil specific IgG antibodies in mediastinal lymph node (MLN) cell cultures. (e–f) Flow cytometry of intracellular cytokine staining for detection of IFN-γ secreting CD4+ T cells specific for M2e from BALF (e) and lung cells (f) at day 5 (d–f) or 7 (a–c) following A/Phil challenge. IFN-γ+ CD4+ T cells were presented from total BALF (1 ml) and Lung (1 ml) cells from individual mouse. Error bars indicate mean ± SEM. The statistical significances between rgH3N2 group versus rgH3N2 4xM2e group were determined using two-way ANOVA and indicated in *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001.Full size imageDepletion of CD4 and CD8 T cells results in differential cross protection between rgH3N2 4xM2e and rgH3N2 prime vaccinationWe observed substantial cross protection by priming rgH3N2 virus even without the induction of M2e specific antibodies and cross HAI activities, suggesting the roles of cross protective T cells. Also, to determine whether M2e specific antibodies would significantly contribute to cross protection, rgH3N2 or rgH3N2 4xM2e primed mice were treated with T cell depleting anti-CD4 or anti-CD8 antibodies prior to challenge with 25 LD50 of A/Phil (H3N2). As shown in supplementary data (Supplementary Fig. S7), T cells in the groups immunized with rgH3N2 or rgH3N2 4xM2e were effectively depleted by delivering either anti-CD4 or anti-CD8 or both antibodies prior to infection with A/Phil (H3N2, 17 LD50). Anti-CD4 (Supplementary Fig. S8a,c) or anti-CD8 (Supplementary Fig. S8b,d) antibody treatment resulted in significant weight loss (24% or 16% respectively) in the rgH3N2 group, lowering the survival rate (50% with anti-CD4, Supplementary Fig. S8c), compared to moderate weight loss (9.5 to 13%) in the rgH3N2 4xM2e group. Statistically significant difference was observed in the CD4 depleted but not CD8 depleted rgH3N2 4xM2e group prior to challenge, suggesting that CD4 is primarily responsible. When both CD4 and CD8 were depleted, the rgH3N2 group displayed significant weight loss and all mice reaching the humane endpoint (Fig. 6a,e). In contrast, 100% mice from the rgH3N2 4xM2e group survived with 8% body weight loss (Fig. 6a,e). These results suggest that M2e antibodies contribute to cross protection by a prime dose of rgH3N2 4xM2e regardless of T cells at the time of challenge whereas CD4 and CD8 T cells particularly CD4 T cells might play a significant role in cross protection by rgH3N2.Figure 6Depletion of CD4 and CD8 T cells results in differential cross protection between rgH3N2 and rgH3N2 4xM2e primed mice. The rgH3N2 or rgH3N2 4xM2e primed mice (n = 4 or 5/group) were treated with α-CD4/α-CD8 antibodies for T cell depletion prior to influenza virus infection. (a–d) Weight changes and (e–h) survival rates were monitored followed by A/Phil (H3N2) (17 LD50), A/PR8 (1.5 LD50), rgPR8 Mg (3 LD50) and rgPR8 Ms (10 LD50) challenge, respectively. Differential challenge doses were used depending on the subtype, pathogenicity, and T cell-depletion. Error bars indicate mean ± SEM. The statistical significances between rgH3N2 group versus rgH3N2 4xM2e group were determined using two-way ANOVA and indicated in *, P < 0.05; ***, P < 0.001.Full size imageWe extended the impact of both CD4 and CD8 depletion on cross protection against A/PR8 (H1N1) and PR8 reassortants with avian M2 (Fig. 6). Treatment of rgH3N2 4xM2e primed mice with CD4 and CD8 depleting antibodies resulted in 100% survival rates and approximately 13% weight loss after A/PR8 (H1N1) challenge whereas rgH3N2 primed mice showed over 20% weight loss and 0% survival rates (Fig. 6b,f). With CD4 and CD8 T cell depletion, the significant differences in weight changes and survival rates between the groups were observed after rgPR8 Mg challenge (Fig. 6c,g). While rgH3N2 4xM2e mice lost 9% of body weight with 100% survival rate, rgH3N2 mice had 20% weight loss with 20% survival rates. In consistent, the rgH3N2 4xM2e group showed significantly enhanced survival protection with less weight loss against a high lethal dose (20 LD50) of rgPR8 Ms virus (M gene from A/Shanghai/2/2013, H7N9) compared to the rgH3N2 group with 0% survival (Fig. 6d,h). The weight recovery was delayed in surviving mice with CD4 and CD8 T cell depletion after challenge, suggesting an important role of T cells in recovery or preventing severe viral pathology. These results support the differential roles of CD4 and CD8 T cells and M2e specific IgG antibodies in conferring cross protection by rgH3N2 and rgH3N2 4xM2e prime immunization.Boost dose of rgH3N2 4xM2e further enhances M2e antibodiesBoost inoculation (106 EID50 rgH3N2 4xM2e) induced significantly higher levels of M2e specific IgG1 and IgG2a isotype antibodies (Fig. 7a,b) than post prime IgG antibody levels (Fig. 2a,b). Consistent with post prime, hM2e IgG antibody levels post boost with rgH3N2 4xM2e were significantly higher than those of swine M2e or avian M2e antibodies (Supplementary Fig. S3b). Both rgH3N2 and rgH3N2 4xM2e groups increased IgG isotype antibodies and HAI activity against vaccine strain rgH3N2 but not against heterologous viruses including A/PR8, A/Phil, and rgH5N1 (Supplementary Fig. S9a, b, c) compared to prime sera.Figure 7Boost dose of rgH3N2 4xM2e enhances cross protection against A/Phil (H3N2) challenge, correlating with M2e specific IgG levels and lower inflammatory cytokine. Sera were collected at 2 weeks after boost immunization of primed mice with rgH3N2 or rgH3N2 4xM2e. (a) IgG1 or (b) IgG2a antibody responses to M2e peptide. The rgH3N2 or rgH3N2 4xM2e boosted mice (n = 4 /group) were treated with α-CD4/α-CD8 (10 µg/10 µg per individual) antibodies for T cell depletion prior to A/Phil (H3N2) challenge. (c) Weight changes of rgH3N2 or rgH3N2 4xM2e prime-boost mice after challenge with A/Phil (200 LD50). (d) IL-6 levels in BALF or lung extracts at day 5 post challenge with A/Phil.

The statistical significances between rgH3N2 group versus rgH3N2 4xM2e group were determined using two-way ANOVA and indicated in *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001.Full size imageBoost dose of rgH3N2 4xM2e enhances cross protection and correlates with higher M2e specific IgG levels and lower inflammatory cytokines in the respiratory sitesAt 3 weeks after boost dose, rgH3N2 and rgH3N2 4xM2e immunized mice were treated with T cell depleting anti-CD4 and anti-CD8 antibodies and then challenged with A/Phil H3N2 at a high dose. The rgH3N2 4xM2e group showed 100% protection without weight loss whereas the rgH3N2 group displayed substantial weight loss (15%) after A/Phil challenge (Fig. 7c). Consistent with efficacy of cross protection, inflammatory cytokine IL-6 levels were low in BALF and lung extracts from the rgH3N2 4xM2e group (Fig. 7d). Significantly higher levels of M2e specific IgG and IgA antibodies in BALF and lung extracts were induced in the rgH3N2 4xM2e group than those in the rgH3N2 group after A/Phil challenge (Fig. 7e–h). Also, the levels of IgA antibodies specific for rgH3N2 and A/Phil viruses were higher in lung extracts from the rgH3N2 4xM2e group than those from the rgH3N2 group (Fig. 7h).Consistently, boost dose of rgH3N2 4xM2e also enhanced cross protection against heterosubtypic rgH5N1 virus, as shown by less weight loss (~ 4% versus 13% in rgH3N2 control) and undetectable lung viral loads (Fig. 8a,b). Particularly IgG levels specific for M2e were induced at significantly higher levels in BALF and lung extracts from the rgH3N2 4xM2e group than those in the rgH3N2 group or naïve group (Fig. 8c). IgG levels to vaccine (rgH3N2) and challenge virus (rgH5N1) were similar in both groups. As expected, the rgH3N2 and rgH3N2 4xM2e groups presented significantly lower amounts of TNF-α, IFN-γ and IL-6 than the naïve group after infection with rgH5N1 (Fig. 8d). Moreover, rgH3N2 4xM2e vaccine group exhibited lower levels of proinflammatory cytokines (IFN-γ) compared to the rgH3N2 group.Figure 8Boost with rgH3N2 4xM2e enhances cross protection against heterosubtypic A/Viet rgH5N1 virus by vaccination and immune sera.

The statistical significances between rgH3N2 group versus rgH3N2 4xM2e group were determined using two-way ANOVA (a, c–e) or one-way ANOVA (b) and indicated in *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001; ###, P < 0.0005.Full size imageTo determine the role and capability of immune sera in inducing cross protection against heterosubtypic rgH5N1 virus, naïve mice were intranasally infected with A/Vietnam virus (2 LD50) after mixing with boost immune sera from the rgH3N2 and rgH3N2 4xM2e group, and naïve sera respectively (Fig. 8e). The group with rgH3N2 4xM2e immune sera displayed significantly less weight loss (~ 3%) compared to the rgH3N2 serum group with substantial weight loss (~ 15%) similar to the naïve serum group (Fig. 8e). At day 8 post challenge with rgH5N1 virus, the rgH3N2 group started to recover (Fig. 8e). Taken together, these results indicate that M2e specific antibodies in mucosal and systemic sites provide cross protection by restricting viral replication and preventing inflammation.DiscussionThe induction of strain specific neutralizing antibodies is the main immunity by current influenza vaccination, which is suboptimal for providing cross-protection. M2 is incorporated into influenza virions at a very low level23 and poorly immunogenic after vaccination or even with live virus infection24,25. Several strategies were reported in an attempt to overcome the poor immunogenicity of M2e, including fusion of M2e peptides to immunogenic carrier proteins and use of adjuvants11,26,27 or delivery of VLPs containing M2e epitopes13,18,28. M2e fusion protein vaccines (M2e-HBc, M2e-flagellins) were tested in Phase I/II clinical trials, resulting in high seroconversion inducing M2e specific antibody responses29,30. Intramuscular vaccination with M2e fusion protein vaccines was well tolerated except for the high doses (3 µg or 10 µg) of M2e-flagellin conjugates in healthy individuals31. However, there has been no further clinical advancement of M2e based vaccines probably due to low efficacy of M2e immunity alone19,32,33. One drawback might be short-lived M2e antibodies. Another disadvantage is the non-neutralizing nature of M2e immunity conferring low efficacy. An approach to overcome these drawbacks of M2e fusion protein vaccines would be to develop chimeric influenza virus vaccines where multi M2e epitopes are fused to the HA molecules in a way retaining HA functional and immunogenic integrity. It is expected that the tolerability and protective efficacy of chimeric influenza virus vaccines would be compatible with seasonal vaccines in addition to providing extra M2e immunity. In this approach, we generated recombinant seasonal H3N2 influenza A virus expressing chimeric H3 HA molecules with heterologous tandem repeat 4xM2e epitopes. This recombinant H3N2 virus with chimeric 4xM2e-HA was found to be highly attenuated, effective in inducing both M2e and HA immunity, conferring cross protection against different viruses H1N1, reassortants with avian M2, H3N2, H5N1, H7N9, and H9N2 subtypes in mice with a single dose.The comparable in vitro growth kinetics of rgH3N2 4xM2e viruses suggest the integrity of HA functions in recombinant H3N2 virus containing chimeric H3 4xM2e-HA. The pathogenicity of rgH3N2 reassortants (up to 106 EID50) with the PR8 backbone was highly attenuated in mice by 1,000 to 10,000 folds in the aspects of weight changes and viral replication (103 versus 108 EID50 titers) in the lungs compared to the WT A/PR8 (H1N1) virus (104 EID50). The attenuated rgH3N2 phenotypes might serve as an appropriate platform to test vaccine candidates in mice. Owning to the attenuated phenotypes, a single prime dose of rgH3N2 4xM2e within a typical range (105–106 EID50) for LAIV vaccination34,35 could mimic vaccination without displaying pathogenic phenotypes. Chimeric rgH3N2 4xM2e was not defective in inducing immunity to virus.It is significant to observe substantial levels of IgG isotype antibodies specific for M2e after prime with recombinant seasonal rgH3N2 4xM2e virus compared to WT rgH3N2 virus. The rgH3N2 4xM2e primed mice were protected against H1N1 A/PR8 and rgH9N2 virus as shown by 100% survival rates and relatively quicker recovery than the rgH3N2 group with 0 to 30% survival rates. Also, prime dose of rgH3N2 4xM2e provided higher protection with minimum weight loss against lethal challenge with H3N2 A/Phil, rgH5N1, and rgH7N9 virus although rgH3N2 primed mice survived in the absence of inducing cross reactive HAI activity. The efficacy of cross protection by priming with rgH3N2 4xM2e appears to be correlated with enhanced levels of M2e IgG antibodies in sera and mucosal (BALF, lungs) sites as well as IFN-γ secreting CD4 T cells (Fig. 5e,f).The rgH3N2 control group showed substantial protection against H1N1, rgH5N1, rgH7N9, and rgH9N2 virus and A/Phil (H3N2) virus in the absence of cross-reactive HAI titers, lowering 100 folds in lung viral titers compared to mock control mice after infection. With CD4 or CD8 T cell depletion, the differences in cross protection against H3N2 A/Phil and H1N1 A/PR8 viruses were more evident between the rgH3N2 and rgH3N2 4xM2e primed mice. Also, the survival rates were lower particularly in the rgH3N2 group and recovery was delayed under a condition of both CD4 and CD8 T cell depletion even after low challenge doses with group 1 H1N1 virus A/PR8 and reassortants. These results support the significant roles of cross protective T cells particularly during a recovery phase. It is also possible that HA stalk specific antibodies induced in both chimeric 4xM2e-HA and WT rgH3N2 virus groups would contribute to cross protection against group 2 viruses with relatively high doses. This cross protection observed in the control rgH3N2 group, despite significantly lower efficacy than rgH3N2 4xM2e, indicates a caveat in testing vaccine efficacy of live recombinant influenza viruses in mouse models. Consistent, the mice surviving pathogenic influenza virus infection were reported to confer heterosubtypic cross protection21,36,37.The levels of M2e specific IgG antibodies were significantly increased post boost with live rgH3N2 4xM2e virus, indicating effective priming of B cells by the first dose. In line with this outcome, enhanced cross protection against A/Phil H3N2 virus was observed in the rgH3N2 4xM2e group displaying no apparent weight loss after boost compared to the rgH3N2 control. Use of higher dose (50 LD50) challenge is because of prime boost vaccination and the same subtype as the rgH3N2 vaccine strain. When challenged with heterosubtypic rgH5N1 virus, the increases in M2e specific IgG responses in BALF and lungs but not IgG responses to rgH5N1 were higher than those with homosubtypic A/Phil H3N2 challenge. Consistently, BALF and lungs showed highly enhanced levels of IgG and IgA antibodies specific for M2e, compared to the control group.A recent study reported that inactivated chimeric influenza viruses containing an M2e epitope in the immunodominant head site of HA could induce IgG antibodies to M2e and stalk domains after intramuscular vaccination, conferring cross protection22,38. The size of foreign epitopes or fragments to be inserted into the N-terminus of HA appears to be highly flexible as large as 246 residues while maintaining HA functional39. Whereas, recombinant influenza viruses containing only limited length of foreign epitopes less than 18 residues in the HA head domain could be rescued as for generating replication competent viruses40,41. The location of inserting foreign epitopes in HA molecules should be considered in the size of epitopes and routes of vaccination.The non-neutralizing immune mechanisms of protection by M2e antibodies were reviewed29,30,42 in addition to M2e T cell contributions. Previous studies reported that M2e vaccine immune sera did not exhibit neutralization activity by plaque reduction or tissue culture infectivity assays33,43. Mechanisms of protection by passive transfer of M2e antibodies include antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and antibody dependent cell-mediated phagocytosis, which involve Fc receptors, complements, natural killer (NK) cells, and macrophages. Passive transfer of M2e vaccine immune sera prior to virus infection provides survival advantages44. The infection of naïve mice with a mix of challenge virus and sera required smaller amounts of sera than the passive transfer of sera prior to infection. Our current and previous studies indicate that both simultaneous mix and prior-to-infection passive transfer approaches produced similar outcomes. We previously reported that the efficacy of M2e immune sera was significantly reduced or abrogated in Fcγ receptor knockout mice, suggesting a critical role of Fcγ receptors in mediating M2e antibody mediated protection45,46,47. M2e antibody-dependent NK cell activity was reported to be important for M2e immune mediated protection33.In summary, recombinant seasonal influenza rgH3N2 4xM2e virus containing tandem repeat 4xM2e epitopes in the N-terminus of HA molecules retains comparable growth properties in vitro and LAIV-like attenuation phenotypes in vivo in mice. Intranasal prime vaccination with rgH3N2 4xM2e virus could provide broad and enhanced cross protection against different subtypes H1N1, H3N2, rgH5N1, rgH7N9, and rgH9N2 as well as reassortant viruses with avian M2. In vivo limited replication of recombinant influenza virus containing foreign epitopes in the N-terminus HA appears to be an attractive strategy to induce systemic and mucosal immune responses to the inserted epitopes. This study provides insight into developing broad cross protective recombinant influenza virus vaccines. This approach of recombinant influenza virus vaccine platforms with a licensed master backbone should be further tested in ferrets, a more relevant animal model in future studies.Materials and methodsCells and virusesFor DNA transfection to generate reassortants, 293 T cells obtained from ATCC were used and maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium media. Embryonated chicken eggs for influenza virus amplification were obtained from Hy-Line N.A. LLC (Mansfield, GA) and confirmed free of influenza virus. A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (A/PR8, H1N1), A/Philippines/2/82 (A/Phil, H3N2), and rgH5N1 A/Vietnam virus which contains HA (polybasic residues removed) and NA from A/Vietnam/1203/2004 and 6 internal genes from A/PR8 were previously described19. Reverse genetics (rg) H3N2 (A/Switzerland/2013, A/SW) is a reassortant virus X-247 with A/PR8 backbone (CDC influenza resources) containing HA and NA genes from A/Switzerland /9715293/2013 (H3N2) and 6 remaining genes from A/PR8. The viruses were inactivated using formalin (37%) at 1:4000 dilutions in purified virus concentrations (1 mg/ml)48. The rgH7N9 is a reassortant virus containing HA and NA derived from A/Shanghai/2/2013 (H7N9) and the A/PR8 backbone genes43. The reassortant H9N2 virus is A/chicken/Hong Kong/G9/1997 × PR8-IBCDC-2 (CDC influenza resources). The rgPR8 Ms, rgPR8 Mm and rgPR8 Mg reassortant viruses containing avian M2 were generated using the A/PR8 backbone genes by replacing an M gene from A/Shanghai/2/2013 (H7N9), A/Mandarin duck/Korea/PSC24-24/2010 (H5N1) and A/Chicken/Korea/Gimje/2008 (H5N1) respectively.Generation of recombinant reassortant rgH3N2 virus containing 4xM2e-HAA full-length copy of the HA gene from A/SW (H3N2) was used to insert a cloning site for BsmBI restriction enzyme between the signal peptide (SP) sequence and N-terminus in the ectodomain of HA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers. The two PCR products of SP fragment and HA full length with each BsmBI site were linked together by overlapping reactions of PCR products, resulting in the SP-BsmBI-HA construct with an H3 HA full length ectodomain and transmembrane domain. The 4xM2e encoding gene is composed of heterologous M2e sequences derived from human (2xhM2e), swine (1xsM2e), and avian (1xaM2e) influenza A viruses (Fig. 1a) as described21. This 4xM2e gene was amplified using PCR primers with BsmBI sites for insertion into the SP-BsmBI-HA H3 construct in dual promoter pCI plasmid (Fig. 1a). The inserted 4xM2e gene contains flexible linkers AAAGGAA or AAAPGAA between each M2e domain as well as between the 4xM2e sequence and the N-terminus H3 HA (Fig. 1a). The correct insertion of 4xM2e into the full-length H3 HA was confirmed by DNA sequencing of the construct.To generate reassortant rgH3N2 virus containing 4xM2e-HA (rgH3N2 4xM2e), 293 T cells were co-transfected with plasmids encoding 4xM2e-HA (H3) and N2 NA from A/SW (H3N2) and six other plasmids encoding the A/PR8 backbone genes. Two days after transfection, the supernatants were inoculated into 10-day-old embryonated chicken eggs. The rescue of replication competent recombinant viruses was initially screened in egg allantoic fluids by a hemagglutination activity assay and the genetic identity of the reassortant vaccine virus was confirmed by sequence analysis.Characterization and pathogenicity of reassortant rgH3N2 4xM2e-HA virusThe expression of 4xM2e-HA of the rescued reassortant viruses was characterized by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using influenza A virus M2e specific monoclonal antibody (14C2 mAb) (Abcam Inc., Cambridge, MA) or polyclonal antisera specific for H3N2 virus. Growth capability and kinetics of rescued rgH3N2 4xM2e virus were compared with rgH3N2 virus in embryonated eggs.To verify pathogenicity of recombinant rgH3N2 4xM2e virus compared to A/PR8 pathogenic WT virus, BALB/c mice were intranasally (IN) inoculated with 1 × 105 or 1 × 106 EID50 (50% egg infectious dose) of rgH3N2 4xM2e, rgH3N2, or 104 EID50 WT A/PR8 pathogenic viruses. At 3 days after IN infection, nasal turbinates and lung tissue samples were collected and homogenized in DMEM. The supernatants clarified by centrifugation were used to determine virus titers by limiting dilutions in the embryonated eggs and the limit of detection was 1.2 log10EID50/ml. Another set of mice (n = 5 /group) infected with recombinant and WT viruses was daily monitored for 14 days to record body weight changes.Immunizations and virus challenge of miceBALB/c mice (n = 30 /group, 6- to 8-week-old age, Jackson Laboratories) were IN inoculated with 105 EID50 for prime single dose of recombinant rgH3N2 4xM2e or rgH3N2 virus. Another set of primed mice (n = 15 /group) was boosted with 106 EID50 of recombinant rgH3N2 4xM2e or rgH3N2 virus at 4 weeks after priming. Blood samples were collected at 2 weeks after each inoculation for serological immune assays. After 3 weeks of prime or prime boost dose inoculation, rgH3N2 4xM2e, rgH3N2 immune, or unvaccinated (mock) mice were challenged with different subtype viruses as indicated. LD50 dose causing 50% lethality in mice was pre-determined. Differential challenge doses were used depending on the pathogenicity and subtype of virus and experimental conditions (prime, prime-boost, T cell depletion). All animal experiments in this study were approved by the Georgia State University IACUC review boards. Mouse animal experiments including virus infection, blood and tissue collections were performed in accordance with the approved IACUC protocol (A21004) and regulations. The study was carried out in compliance with the ARRIVE (Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments) guidelines.Antibody ELISA and hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assaysVirus-specific antibody responses were determined by ELISA using inactivated H1N1 (A/PR8), H3N2 (A/SW, A/Phil), or rgH5N1 viruses as a coating antigen (4 µg/ml). M2e-specific antibody responses were determined using human, swine, and avian M2e peptide antigens of chemically synthesized 23 amino acids (aa) polypeptides as described13,20. IgG isotypes and IgA antibodies were measured using horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG1, IgG2a, and IgA secondary antibodies (Southern Biotechnology), color reactions developed with tetramethylbenzidine substrates (TMB, Invitrogen). Antibody levels are presented as optical density absorbance values at 450 nm (BioTek ELISA plate reader) or concentrations as calculated using standard IgG and IgA (Southern Biotech). Bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALFs) were obtained by infusing 1.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) into lungs13. HAI assays were determined against homologous, heterologous, and heterosubtypic influenza viruses using chicken red blood cells20,49. Briefly, 1:4 ratios of sera and receptor destroying enzymes (RDE, Sigma) were mixed and incubated for 18 h at 37 °C. After inactivation, the RDE-treated sera were serially diluted and mixed with virus (8 HA units). HAI titers were determined as the highest dilution factor inhibiting the formation of buttons with 0.5% chicken red blood cells.In Vivo T-cell depletion For in vivo systemic T-cell depletion prior to challenge, primed mice with rgH3N2 4xM2e or rgH3N2 received treatment with anti-CD4 (CD4 clone GK1.5) and/or anti-CD8 (CD8 clone 53.6.7) mAbs. Antibodies (BioXCell, West Lebanon, NH) were injected to the mice with intraperitoneal (IP) and IN sequential delivery at 2 days interval (anti-CD4 200 µg /mouse (IP) and 10 µg/mouse (IN), anti-CD8, 150 µg /mouse (IP), 10 µg/mouse (IN)). The levels of CD4 and CD8 T cells were below the detection after treating with CD4 and CD8 depleting antibodies as confirmed by flow cytometry of bloods (Supplementary Fig. S7). All groups (n = 4) were challenged with a lethal dose of A/PR8 H1N1 (1.5 LD50), rgPR8 Mg (3 LD50), rgPR8 Ms (10 LD50) or A/Phil H3N2 (17 LD50) influenza virus. Mice were monitored daily to record weight changes and mortality.Intracellular cytokine staining of T cellsBALF and lung cells were stimulated with M2e peptides (SLLTEVETPIRNEWGSRSN) (5 μg/mL) for 5 h at 37 °C in the presence of brefeldin A (BFA) (20 μg/mL). After stimulation, lymphocytes were stained with T cell marker mAb for CD4 (CD4-PE/Cy5, BD Biosciences) and CD8 (CD8α-PE, Biolegend) by following a procedure of BD Cytofix/Cytoperm Plus Kit. Intracellular staining of the permeabilized lymphocytes was conducted with IFN-γ cytokine mAb (anti-mouse IFN-γ-APC/Cy7, BD Biosciences). All samples were analyzed by using LSR-II/Fortessa flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA, USA) and analyzed using the Flowjo software (FlowJo V10, Tree Star, Inc.).In vivo efficacy tests of immune sera Immune sera collected at 4 weeks after boost inoculation were heat-inactivated at 56 °C for 30 min, 4 folds diluted, and then mixed with 2 LD50 of influenza virus rgH5N1 (A/Vietnam) and incubated at room temperature for 1 h as previously described19,20. The rgH5N1 virus mixed with immune sera was used to IN infect naive mice (n = 3) and body weight and survival rates were daily monitored for 8 days.In vitro IgG antibody detection and cytokine ELISA assays Secreted IgG antibodies specific for M2e, rgH3N2 and A/Phil were determined from mediastinal lymph nodes (MLN) from BALB/c mice. The cells from MLN were isolated at day 6 after challenge and cultured for 6 days in the plate pre-coated with M2e, rgH3N2 or A/Phil. The combined levels of IgG antibodies secreted into the culture supernatants and captured on the plate were analyzed by ELISA and presented. The inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IFN-γ and IL-6 from bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALF) and lung extracts were measured by cytokine ELISA as described in the previous study50. Cytokines were detected using Ready-SET-Go kits with TNF-α, IFN-γ or IL-6 specific antibodies (eBioscience, San Diego, CA).Statistical analysisTwo-way or one-way ANOVA were used to determine the statistical significance when comparing two different conditions. P-values of less than or equal to 0.05 were considered significant. Data analysis was performed using Prism software (GraphPad software Inc., San Diego, CA). ReferencesKrammer, F. et al. Influenza.

This column compares the situation to the 1918 influenza pandemic and examines whether the flu pandemic affected US congressional, gubernatorial, and presidential elections during 1918–1920. Flu deaths did have a small effect on elections – voters did indeed blame incumbent parties for bad health outcomes. However, it appears they cared about other things much more. Share Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Authors Noel Maurer Associate Professor of International Affairs and International Business Federal Reserve Bank Of New York Leticia Arroyo Abad Associate Professor of Economics City University Of New York The COVID-19 pandemic changed almost everything about the 2020 American elections. The Biden campaign made much of the federal failure to combat the disease. President Trump politicised the response, appearing to run against practices like mask-wearing that are designed to slow infections (Milosh et al. 2020). Campaign techniques changed dramatically, particularly on the Democratic side, with door-knocking and in-person rallies falling off and outreach moving to video and virtual realms. Polls showed that most Americans disapproved of President Trump’s response to COVID-19 – a 17-point chasm by election day. A cross-country analysis of polling data showed that governments that failed to contain COVID-19 infections suffered falling approval rates (Herrera et al. 2020). And yet, the pandemic appeared to have remarkably little effect on the American electoral returns (Wilson 2020, McMinn and Stein 2020). In fact, when we ran a simple set of correlations using county-based data (Abad and Maurer 2021), we found that COVID-19 death rates were weakly correlated with a swing towards Donald Trump between 2016 and 2020 (Figure 1). Figure 1 Associations between county-level characteristics and the swing towards the GOP in the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections Notes: Blue bars indicate a swing towards the Democratic Party; red towards the Republican Party. Can this be right? Did the pandemic really not matter to the ‘pandemic election’ of 2020? A good way to start analysing this question is to ask what effect we should expect a pandemic disease to have on election results. The best parallel history provides is the 1918-19 influenza pandemic, which broke out during an election year and killed over 600,000 Americans (Abad and Maurer 2021). In September 1918, the second wave of the flu arrived in the US at Fort Devens, Massachusetts, and rapidly spread across the country (Figure 2). Excess mortality exceeded 600,000. Children lost their parents; grandparents outlived their adult children. Figure 2 The spread of the second wave of the Spanish flu, 1918 We assembled a county-level dataset of votes by party for three levels of government: the 1918 congressional elections, the 1918, 1919, and 1920 gubernatorial elections, and the 1920 presidential election. We combined these data with new estimates (derived from census data) of county-level excess mortality. We obtained county-level economic and demographic controls from the census. We found no discernible effect on turnout. The arrival of women’s suffrage was not the reason for low turnout. New York was the only state in our sample to allow women’s suffrage for the first time in the 1918 election; state-level fixed effects absorbed other states that switched in 1919 as a result of the ratification of the 19th Amendment guaranteeing American women the right to vote. But we did find that the more the Spanish flu hit a county, the more the voters swung away from the incumbent governor and congressional Democrats. These findings are in line with Heersink et al. (2017), who found that counties hit hard by the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 punished Herbert Hoover in 1928. The relationship held up when we used the underlying disease environment and a county’s distance to military camps (which spread disease) as instruments (Figure 3). Figure 3 Effect of Spanish flu excess mortality on vote shares In short, our regression results indicate that voters did indeed blame incumbent parties for bad outcomes. But it is one thing to find an econometric result; it is another to show that the result makes sense, given what we know about the history. There are a lot of misconceptions about the context of the Spanish flu. The first is that voters were unaware of the flu outside their immediate locality because of wartime censorship. The second is that the government didn’t react to the pandemic. The third is that voters had no reason to believe that the government could, would, or should protect them against infectious disease outbreaks, which meant that the pandemic never became a political issue. The view that wartime censorship kept the pandemic out of the papers appears to come from an interview with historian John Barry in which he asserted that 1918 newspapers provided “lots of war coverage but very little about the pandemic.” This struck us as odd, given that Barry (2004) contains no evidence of such censorship. We analysed 495 daily newspapers from the beginning of September 1918 to the end of 1918 and found that flu coverage exceeded war coverage during the peak of the pandemic (Figure 4). Figure 4 Flu to war mentions in the newspapers In addition, the federal government printed tens of millions of pamphlets and posters to alert the public and encourage behaviour that would slow the spread of the flu. In Alfred Crosby’s words, “If influenza could have been smothered by paper, many lives would have been saved in 1918.” Figure 5 US Public Health Service pamphlet Did the federal government fail to react to the crisis? It is true that President Wilson remained oddly silent. But once Philadelphia and Chicago succumbed, Congress appropriated $1 million (the 2019 equivalent of $253 million as a share of GDP) to mobilise civilian doctors into the US Public Health Service (USPHS) and placed the Army and Navy’s health departments – bloated to a huge size by the war mobilisation – at the USPHS’s disposal. Public laboratories in New York and the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota worked overtime to develop a vaccine. They achieved one in record time, but the problem was that they did not understand the aetiology of influenza and they vaccinated against the wrong pathogen. Pfeiffer’s bacillus was a secondary invader of flu victims but did not cause the disease. Scientists realised that they had the wrong cause by July 1919 but that was too late to stop New York and Illinois from spending millions on useless vaccines. The pandemic, meanwhile, dominated state politics. State and local governments banned public gatherings, shut down bars and restaurants, closed schools, staggered hours, and mandated mask-wearing. In California, the state had to crack down on San Diego when the city council tried to revoke closure orders and mask mandates. San Franciscans organised an “Anti-Mask League” and the jails filled up with people who refused to wear them. (Several people were shot in altercations over masks and someone sent a mail bomb to the head of the Board of Health.) In New York, the governor mysteriously discovered outbreaks in towns where his Democratic opponent planned to speak. An angry Al Smith proclaimed that GOP officials “want to prevent the spread of Democratic doctrine rather the spread of Spanish influenza.” Governor Whitman’s ploy did not work and when the New York GOP lost they blamed their defeat on the flu. In short, we found a significant effect of flu deaths on election outcomes which we failed to erase despite myriad attempts. The effect we found, however, was relatively small. Roughly speaking, an increase of one standard deviation in flu deaths implied a shift of 2.8 percentage points against the congressional Democrats and a 0.8-point shift against the governor’s party. Most congressional elections, however, shifted by significantly more than that. Only in Maryland were deaths high enough to have swung the gubernatorial election. In a sense, we have the best sort of null result – a very precisely estimated small effect! Voters cared about the Spanish flu and they held politicians accountable. They just cared about other things much more. References Abad, Leticia, and Noel Maurer (2021), “Do pandemics shape elections?

(Getty Images: sorbetto/Science Photo Library)abc.net.auews/covid-pfizer-astrazeneca-flu-vaccine-which-jab-first-australia/13156256Link copiedShareShare articleAustralians are being advised to wait two weeks between getting the flu jab and COVID-19 vaccine — but it doesn't matter which one you have first, according to the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI).Key points:The government recommends everyone six months and older get immunised against the fluThe Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines each need two dosesExperts say if you are eligible for the COVID-19 jab, get that one firstThis advice is based on there being two COVID-19 vaccines available to Australians early- to mid-2021: the Pfizer shot, which will be rolled out to top-tier priority groups across Australia from Monday and the AstraZeneca vaccine, which was on Tuesday given the green light by the Therapeutic Goods Administration TGA).While the ATAGI "doesn't recommend" getting both the COVID and flu vaccines on the same day, the group said there could be circumstances where the co-administration of an influenza vaccine with a COVID-19 vaccine could be considered.What else do you need to know about booking your vaccinations this season?Which vaccine first?Last month, the ATAGI released its advice on the relative timing of administering influenza and COVID-19 vaccines in 2021.Both the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines need two doses to be effective, with the Pfizer option needing to be given 21 days apart and the AstraZeneca jab 4-12 weeks apart. The Australian Government recommends everyone aged six months and over get immunised against seasonal flu.(Reuters: Gareth Fuller/Andreas Gebert)But the ATAGI says these jabs can be taken either side of the flu vaccine.How CSL plans to make 1 million vaccines a weekWhen millions of Australians roll up their sleeve to get a locally made vaccine, the shot itself may only take a couple of seconds, but it will have been three months in the making.Read more"There is no particular requirement regarding the order of receiving a dose of influenza vaccine and either the first or second dose of a COVID-19 vaccine," the advice said.Immunisation Coalition chairman Rod Pearce, who is a practising GP in South Australia, says if you are eligible for the COVID-19 jab and are offered one first, take it."If it was a choice, have the COVID when it's available because the rollout of that is less predictable," Dr Pearce said."The influenza vaccine will definitely be here in April and we should have an abundant supply because it's manufactured here in Australia."Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemicRobert Booy, professor of paediatrics and child health at the University of Sydney and a senior professorial fellow at the National Centre for Immunisation Research, said older Australians should book in for the COVID-19 jab before the flu vaccine."It comes down to practicalities: most people who are at a high risk in the elderly or occupational, or in the chronic disease groups, should probably get COVID vaccines first," he said.Professor Booy said this was because the threat of coronavirus was still "relatively high", and had a higher death rate for this age group than the flu.But he said kids should get the influenza jab first, as children under five were of "considerably lower risk of COVID than the flu"."For children under five who are at risk of severe flu and are at risk of transmitting the flu to adults and other children, flu should probably come first because we don't have a licenced vaccine for children under five," Professor Booy said. Both coronavirus vaccines need two doses to be effective.(Getty Images: Zinkevych)TGA head John Skerritt recommended people in the first round of the Pfizer shot rollout, which starts on Monday, should get their COVID-19 shot first.How long between each jab?Dr Pearce and Professor Booy backed the ATAGI's recommendation to have the vaccines two weeks apart.Dr Pearce said the 14-day wait time was a precaution and would allow health workers to identify which jab was the cause of any potential side effects."This is because we are being careful, not because we think there's a problem," he said.ATAGI advice:Don't have the COVID-19 jab and flu vaccine on the same dayIf you can, wait two weeks between each vaccineIt doesn't matter which order you get the jabs inIf you have the COVID and flu vaccines within two weeks of each other, you won't need revaccinationDr Pearce used the example of a patient getting a "Pfizer vaccine in the one arm and the flu vaccine in the other", which could theoretically lead to an unusual reaction.He said — purely hypothetically — a patient could have a local reaction or lymph node reaction after getting the Pfizer vaccine, which could mean they didn't have the same immune response to the influenza vaccine."There's concern with any vaccines about knowing what we know and how they work and how they interact," Dr Pearce said."Australia has always had a principal that any combined vaccines, any vaccines given together should be tested in Australia and we should have the evidence to know that in Australia under our conditions the vaccines don't have less of a response."Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemicAdjunct Professor John Skerritt said at the moment, regulators were not seeing any "significant problems" regarding the coronavirus vaccines. "There's well known issues such as headache, temperature and sore arm and so forth, but nothing that seems to be really very serious," he said. "So at the moment, it's recommended that you have your shots 14 days or so apart."Professor Booy said the immune system also needed time to respond to the vaccine, and giving Australians a two-week window would help build that response.Loading...What if you get them within the same fortnight?If someone was to have both jabs in the same two-week window, Dr Pearce said it wouldn't be a huge concern."Remember we don't have the data, so when we don't have the data, we are honestly saying 'this is the issue', but we can't see there would be a problem, we don't anticipate a problem and we don't expect a lesser immune response if you have them together," he said. Professor Booy said while he definitely would not recommend someone having both jabs at the same time, if someone was to have them in quick succession, he urged them to make their doctor aware as it could present an opportunity to study what immunity could be offered.Both Dr Pearce and Professor Booy said anyone who had any adverse or unusual side effects to either vaccine should report it straight away. Waiting two weeks between each vaccine also allows the body to build an immune response.(Getty Images: South_Agency)Will the COVID jab affect the flu shot rollout?Government-funded flu vaccines are expected to be available in about April this year, and are free for at-risk groups, including children aged six months to five years.Charlotte Hespe is Royal Australian College of General Practitioners NSW and ACT chairman and owns her own GP practice. She said the rollout of the COVID-19 jab came at a difficult time for family doctors. When will I get the COVID-19 vaccine?Tell us a bit about yourself and we'll tell you where you are in the queue for the COVID-19 jab.Read more"For us, it's the worst possible timing because it is right in the flu vaccine," Dr Hespe said."All general practitioners will have three separate vaccinations that we need to give people at risk."But Dr Pearce said he didn't expect the COVID-19 vaccine rollout to impact supply of the flu jab, as they were separate vaccines manufactured in different facilities."There's no reason to think that the factory that makes the influenza vaccine is going to be affected by the COVID rollout," he said.Professor Booy said the rollout of both at the same time could present a "logistical challenge" for some."GPs are used to giving large volumes of flu vaccine, so they just need to be even more organised than usual," he said.Read more about COVID-19 vaccines:The 'concerning' divide in Australians' attitudes to vaccinesTracking Australia's COVID vaccine rolloutDr Hespe said Australia had seen record low numbers of flu cases during the pandemic — but it was important for Australians to stay vigilant about influenza this season.Professor Booy agreed."If we let our guard down, flu will be back with a vengeance. It was very quiet last year," he said.Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemicAsk us your coronavirus questionsPosted 16 Feb 202116 Feb 2021Tue 16 Feb 2021 at 5:15am, updated 16 Feb 202116 Feb 2021Tue 16 Feb 2021 at 10:33pmShareCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Related storiesAstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine approved for use in AustraliaTopic:Government and PoliticsPhoto shows A vial of AstraZeneca vaccine is held up.How long will the COVID vaccines last?

In this study, we evaluated the effects of maoto as an herbal multi-compound medicine on host responses in a mouse model of influenza infection. On the fifth day of oral administration to mice intranasally infected with influenza virus [A/PR/8/34 (H1N1)], maoto significantly improved survival rate, decreased viral titer, and ameliorated the infection-induced phenotype as compared with control mice. Analysis of the lung and plasma transcriptome and lipid mediator metabolite profile showed that maoto altered the profile of lipid mediators derived from ω-6 and ω-3 fatty acids to restore a normal state, and significantly up-regulated the expression of macrophage- and T-cell-related genes. Collectively, these results suggest that maoto regulates the host’s inflammatory response by altering the lipid mediator profile and thereby ameliorating the symptoms of influenza.

Elderly and individuals who have underlying diseases with immune system dysfunction are especially vulnerable to influenza and often develop severe symptoms1,2. Although several anti-influenza drugs targeting influenza viral factors have been developed, problems such as the emergence of strains with acquired drug resistance remain unsolved3. Thus, there is a need for more effective medications to treat influenza virus infection. From this perspective, drug interventions targeted at the host immune response are an attractive approach to suppress the influenza virus and mitigate viral damage without drug resistance.Cytokines and lipid mediators are heavily involved in the host response to infection, and appropriate control of these factors is considered to be critical for suppressing the severity of the infection4,5. In the case of infectious diseases, the acute proinflammatory response plays a vital role in host defense by attacking the virus and inhibiting its replication. However, such inflammatory responses also damage tissues, and an excessive response is adversely harmful to the host. Thus, modulating anti-inflammatory effects has long been an important area of research. Recent studies have shown that specific lipid mediators appropriately regulate the inflammatory response and its resolution. Furthermore, the role of lipid mediators that promote the resolution of inflammation—in particular, specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) such as protectins, maresins, and resolvins—have been the focus of many studies as endogenous modulators of the inflammatory response during infection6,7,8. The host response induced by influenza infection involves a complex interaction between the virus and several host factors9; thus, it might be appropriate to use a drug with a long tail to control this type of host response10. Furthermore, a traditional herbal medicine that contains multiple compounds might be an excellent option to simultaneously modulate the host factors.Maoto (MT; or ma-huang-tang in Chinese), a traditional herbal medicine in Japan (Kampo), is prescribed widely to care for symptoms of upper respiratory infections and influenza11,12. Maoto is a mixture of four component herbs: Armeniacae semen (32.3%), Glycyrrhizae radix (9.6%), Cinnamomi cortex (25.8%), and Ephedrae herba (32.3%). The active ingredients for inflammation response in maoto such as amygdalin in Armeniacae semen, glycyrrhizin in Glycyrrhizae radix, which is metabolized to glycyrrhetinic acid and ephedrine in Ephedrae herba has been reported13,14,15. Furthermore, we revealed the profile of ingredients in maoto after oral treatment, and we estimated that many ingredients and metabolites of maoto containing ingredients such as pseudoephedrine, methylephedrine, prunasin, liquiritigenin and isoliquiritigenin are absorbed and detected in plasma16. Maoto has antipyretic17,18 and anti-malaise effects in children19, and improves flu symptoms with efficacy comparable to that of neuraminidase inhibitors in adults infected with influenza A virus11,20. Experimentally, MT has been shown to decrease viral titer and exert an antipyretic effect21,22, as well as to ameliorate influenza virus-induced pneumonia23. The herbal ingredients in MT directly inhibit influenza viral replication in vitro, and affect inflammatory responses both in vitro and in an in vivo animal model14,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33. While these findings suggest that MT directly inhibits influenza virus infection and regulates the host inflammatory response as a multi-ingredient drug, its detailed mechanism of action has not been clarified.Studies using in vivo rodent models have shown that MT broadly ameliorates the acute inflammatory response and injury, including both acute lung injury induced by cold/warm cycles of stress34 and asthma in ovalbumin-sensitized mice35. Our previous study revealed that MT significantly ameliorates flu-like symptoms induced by polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (PIC; a Toll-like receptor 3 agonist) and decreases the pro-inflammatory cytokine response16. We also found that MT influences broad lipid mediator responses. In the acute phase at 2 h after treatment, MT affects the broad ω-3 fatty acid (FA)-derived lipid mediator response associated with anti-inflammatory and pro-resolution responses, and also modulates the acute production of prostaglandins and leukotrienes by PIC. Those findings suggested that MT acts via a specific mechanism to ameliorate acute infectious disease via host lipid mediator and inflammatory systems, specifically affecting anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving factors in the resolution phase of infection.In this study, we first evaluated the ameliorative effect of MT on a mouse model of influenza virus infection. We then analyzed the lipid mediator and transcriptome profiles on the fifth day after infection to identify endogenous factors affected by MT and to elucidate its pharmacological properties towards influenza virus infection.ResultsMaoto reduced viral titer and ameliorated phenotypes induced by influenza virus infectionThe experimental protocol is shown in Fig. 1a. We infected mice with mouse-adapted influenza virus [A/PR/8/34(H1N1)] and then orally administered MT daily for 5 days starting 1 h after inoculation. The mortality and phenotype induced by the infection were observed for 8 days post inoculation (dpi).Figure 1Effect of maoto on a mouse model of influenza virus infection. (a) Experimental protocol. Influenza virus was administered to mice by intranasal inoculation. Maoto (MT; 0.5 or 2 g/10 mL/kg) was orally administered 1 h after inoculation, and continued for 4 days (5 days treatment in total). Mice with no virus inoculation were used as a control against the infection, and infected mice treated distilled water were used as infected control mice. Data from 10 mice each in the influenza virus inoculation (IVI) control group, IVI with maoto 0.5 g/kg treatment [IVI + MT(L)] group, and IVI with maoto 2 g/kg treatment [IVI + MT(H)] group were used to determine the average survival period. Another 10 mice each in the no-inoculation (NI), IVI, IVI + MT(L), and IVI + MT(H) groups were sacrificed at 5 days post inoculation (dpi) to collect tissue and plasma samples for analysis of viral titer and histopathology. In addition, lipid mediator and transcriptome analysis were performed for the NI, IVI and IVI + MT(H) groups. At 5 dpi, the number of surviving mice were 10, 4, 7, and 9 in the NI, IVI, IVI + MT(L), and IVI + MT(H) groups, respectively. (b) Survival period (dpi). (c) Clinical sign score (dpi).

Whereas all mice in the influenza virus inoculation (IVI) group died by 7 dpi (median survival period, 5 days), those in the group with a higher dose of MT [IVI + MT(H)] lived for significantly longer (median survival period, 7 days) (Fig. 1b). The total clinical sign score [i.e., average summed score of four clinical signs (eye, fur, behavior, and other such as hypothermia, emaciation and respiratory failure), where individual signs were scored from 0 (normal) to 4 (death)], was also significantly reduced by MT treatment (Fig. 1c). The difference in survival rate between the IVI and IVI + MT(H) groups was most significant at 5 dpi. Therefore, we analyzed the effect of MT on viral titer and disease-induced phenotype (body temperature, body weight, lung injury, and pathological findings) at 5 dpi.At 5 dpi, the number of surviving mice in each group was 4/10 (IVI), 7/10 [lower dose of MT, IVI + MT(L)], and 9/10 [IVI + MT(H)]. The survival rate was significantly higher for the IVI + MT(H) group than for the IVI group. The viral titer at 5 dpi was measured for all surviving mice. The IVI + MT(L) and IVI + MT(H) groups had significantly lower viral titers as compared with the IVI group (Fig. 1d). Regarding the disease-induced phenotype, MT administration significantly increased rectal temperature, which was significantly lowered by IVI (Fig. 1e), but there were no differences in body weight between the IVI and IVI + MT groups (Fig. S1). In addition, MT ameliorated infection-induced severe lung injury (Fig. 1f–h). The IVI + MT(H) group had significantly lower scores of macroscopic findings based on an evaluation of consolidation area from 0 (no consolidation) to 4 (consolidation area > 2/3) (Fig. 1f). Histopathological analysis showed that MT improved the degeneration and necrosis of bronchial mucosal epithelium induced by influenza infection (Fig. 1g,h; the recorded pathological scores are summarized in Table S1). Taking all observations of the phenotypic effects of MT into account, we used the high MT dose of 2 g/kg at 5 dpi as a measurement point for further analysis of host responses.Maoto modulated the host lipid mediator responseBased on the above effects of MT on the influenza viral titer and host phenotype, we analyzed lipid mediators in lung and plasma by LC–MS/MS in order to elucidate the host response in more detail. In total, the analysis covered 158 lipid mediators, including metabolites derived from ω-3 FA; docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)-derived metabolites; and ω-6 FA-derived metabolites such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes (Table S2).Overall, 77 lipid mediators were detected in lung. Clustering analysis showed that specific clusters were associated with MT (Fig. 2a and Fig. S2a). Specifically, lipid mediators in clusters A, B and D, which were increased (A) or decreased (B and D) by IVI, were normalized by MT administration. Furthermore, lipid mediators in cluster C were specifically increased by MT. The lipid mediators that were significantly affected by MT are shown in Fig. S2b.Figure 2Clustering analysis and metabolic pathway mapping of lipid mediators in lung and plasma. (a) Clustering analysis in lung. A–D show specific clusters of lipid mediators that were altered by maoto (MT) relative to IVI. (b) Pathway mapping of lipid mediators in lung.

The log2FC in detected lipid mediators for IVI/NI (left column) and IVI + MT/IVI (right column) were mapped on the metabolic pathway. To show the related pathway of specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs), undetected SPMs were included on the pathway as hexagons. The percentage of increased or decreased lipid mediators for IVI/NI and IVI + MT/IVI is summarized in the table. For clustering analysis, the data were normalized and standardized by autoscale for metabolites. Euclidean distance was used for the distance measure, and Ward’s method was used for the clustering algorithm. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 versus IVI. ##P < 0.01 versus NI. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 versus IVI. #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01 versus NI.Full size imagePathway enrichment analysis of the lipid mediators affected by IVI showed that IVI affected the balance of ω-6 and ω-3 FA-derived lipid mediators. In detail, 63.6% of ω-6 FA-derived lipid mediators and 60.0% of arachidonic acid (AA)-derived lipid mediators were reduced, and 60.0% of ω-3 FA-derived lipid mediators were increased by IVI (Fig. 2b and Fig. S2c). In comparison with the normal state, ω-3 FA-derived lipid mediators suggested activated. By contrast, MT tended to increase both ω-6 and ω-3 FA-derived lipid mediators: specifically, 70.9% of ω-6 FA-derived lipid mediators, 77.5% of AA-derived lipid mediators, and 75% of ω-3 FA-derived lipid mediators were increased by MT. Therefore, MT increased both ω-3 and ω-6 FA-derived lipid mediators, and enhanced the broad lipid mediator pathway in infected mice. This effect of MT seemed to be associated with both activation of the inflammatory response against the influenza virus and resolution of lung damage. Notably, in the lung, MT significantly increased metabolites in the pro-inflammatory pathway of leukotriene B4 (LTB4), including LTB4 and its metabolites 12-keto-LTB4, as well as prostaglandin J2 (PGJ2), which is involved in protecting the influenza virus infection-associated host immune response5,36,37. Furthermore, an ω-3 FA lipid mediator, 10(s),17(s)-dihydroxy-docosahexaenoic acid (10,17-DiHDoHE), which is associated with improvement of acute lung injury in IVI38,39,40, was significantly decreased by IVI and increased by MT. Therefore, MT enhanced host lipid mediators associated with decreasing influenza virus and with recovery of inflammation-induced tissue damage in lung.Analysis of the lipid mediator profile in plasma detected 39 lipid mediators, which we subjected to cluster analysis to identify characteristics due to IVI and MT (Fig. 2c and Fig. S3a). Lipid mediators in clusters A and C were decreased and increased, respectively, by IVI, and were normalized by MT. The lipid mediators that were significantly normalized by MT are shown in Fig. S3b. Furthermore, lipid mediators in clusters B and D were specifically increased and decreased, respectively, by MT. In pathway enrichment analysis, 90.9% of AA-derived lipid mediators were increased by IVI. In infected mice, MT tended to reduce ω-6 FA-derived lipid mediators, especially AA-derived lipid mediators, and slightly reduced ω-3 FA-derived lipid mediators. In total, 77.3% of ω-6 FA-derived lipid mediators, 90.9% of AA-derived lipid mediators, and 60% of ω-3 FA-derived lipid mediators were reduced by MT (Fig. 2d, and Fig. S3c). Overall, systemic AA-derived lipid mediators tended to be reduced by MT, which suggests that the effect of MT on host lipid mediators in plasma may act to ameliorate the acute systemic inflammatory response.Maoto affected specific gene expression profiles associated with macrophage and T cell immune responsesOur analysis of the host phenotype and endophenotype for lipid mediators clearly showed that MT acts on the inflammatory immune response of the host. We therefore performed transcriptome analysis to assess the specific gene networks associated with IVI and MT. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to find the gene networks associated with NI, IVI, and IVI + MT (Fig. S4). In total, we identified 45 modules, among which 9, 17, and 12 modules were significantly associated with NI, IVI and IVI + MT, respectively (Fig. S4e).Next, we conducted cell-type enrichment (CTen) analysis on the WGCNA-identified modules, which revealed that eight modules were significantly associated with specific cell types (Supplementary Fig. S4f). We also found that three modules (colored-coded as blue, turquoise and green) including relatively large gene sets (blue, 2917; turquoise, 9504; green, 1220), which were significantly enriched in the immune cell marker genes defined in CTen, were correlated with MT, and showed a specific pattern of correlation with each trait (Fig. 3a and Figs. S4g-i). The blue module negatively correlated with NI and positively correlated with IVI and IVI + MT; the turquoise module positively correlated with NI and negatively correlated with IVI and IVI + MT; and the green module negatively correlated with NI, positively correlated with IVI + MT, but did not correlate with IVI. Furthermore, we observed gene sets that were significantly increased/decreased by MT in each module (Fig. 3b–d).Figure 3Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). (a) Correlation between module and trait. (b–d) Volcano plot for comparing gene expression between IVI + MT and IVI in the blue, green, and turquoise modules. Blue indicates a significant decrease in gene expression in IVI + MT relative to IVI at P < 0.05 and fold change (FC) < 0.67; red indicates a significant increase in gene expression in IVI + MT relative to IVI at P < 0.05 and FC > 1.5. (e) Summary of cell type enrichment analysis (CTen). –log10 Benjamini–Hochberg adjusted P > 2 was considered to be significant. For each module, the left column shows the results using all genes in the module; the right column shows the results using genes significantly increased by MT relative to IVI. (f) Pathway enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes between IVI and NI in the blue (FDR < 0.05) (f1) and green (major top 7 pathways with FDR < 0.05) (f2) modules. The gene sets significantly increased by IVI relative to NI at criteria of P < 0.05 and log2FC > 3 were used for analysis. (g) Pathway enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes between IVI + MT and IVI in the green (FDR < 0.05) (g1) and turquoise (FDR < 0.05) (g2) modules. The gene sets significantly increased by MT relative to IVI at criteria of P < 0.05 and FC > 1.5 were used for analysis.Full size imageTo identify specific gene functions within these three modules, we analyzed the cell type specificity induced by infection and MT by using CTen analysis. Based on all genes in each module (Fig. 3e and Fig. S4j), CTen analysis showed that the blue module was mainly enriched in macrophage cell types, the green module was broadly enriched in many kinds of cell type, while the turquoise module was enriched in lung cell types. These results showed that IVI induces a broad host immune response, such as migration/activation of macrophages, and disrupts the normal profile of lung cell gene expression at 5 dpi. By contrast, the genes increased by MT in the blue and green modules were especially enriched in macrophage cell types, while those increased by MT in the turquoise module were mainly enriched in T-cell types. These results suggest that MT notably enhances macrophage and T-cell immune responses in influenza infection (Fig. 3e and Fig. S4j).Using MetaCore, we conducted pathway enrichment analysis to reveal the module functions associated with influenza infection and MT treatment. This analysis showed that the genes significantly increased by IVI relative to NI (blue and green modules) were mainly enriched in the interferon-γ-associated macrophage activation (blue), neutrophil-derived granule protein and cytokine (blue), aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling (blue), and interferon signaling (green) pathways (Fig. 3f). On the contrary, no enriched function was observed among the genes with increased expression in the turquoise module (Fig. 3f). Collectively, the results of cell type and pathway enrichment analysis indicated that host responses involving interferons and cytokines in macrophages and neutrophils, which are closely associated with the acute host response in influenza virus infection41,42, continued in inoculated mice until 5 dpi.We then evaluated the effect of MT on these modules. The genes that were significantly increased by MT relative to IVI (green module) were mainly enriched in bradykinin and kallistatin maturation, and in inflammatory responses such as interferon signaling (Fig. 3g1). In addition, the genes that were significantly increased by MT in the turquoise module were primarily enriched in the immune response of the T-cell subset and lectin-induced complement pathway (Fig. 3g2). Furthermore, the gene expression of amphiregulin, which is associated with tissue repair by macrophage and innate lymphoid cells43, was significantly increased by MT [log2FC(IVI + MT/IVI) = 0.858, P < 0.01]. These WGCNA-based data were consistent with the findings from the analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEG) between IVI and NI, and between IVI + MT and IVI (Fig. S5). Notably, key factors such as interferons, lipid mediators, and amphiregulin were increased by MT, which indicates that MT might enhance host responses against influenza virus infection and aid recovery from severe lung tissue damage.Lastly, we assessed the correlations between gene expression and lipid mediator profiles by WGCNA. For this analysis, the intensity of lipid mediators was used as the trait. As a result, we found lipid mediators that were significantly correlated with the blue, green and turquoise modules (Fig. 4a). The blue and green modules showed a similar correlation pattern, whereas the turquoise module showed an opposite pattern. We then assessed the correlation patterns of the lipid mediators within their metabolic pathways (Fig. 4b). On the one hand, lipid mediators derived from AA and DHA tended to be positively correlated with the blue and green modules. Because these two modules were significantly associated with macrophage gene sets, the lipid mediators positively correlated with these modules may be associated with macrophage function. On the other hand, several lipid mediators metabolized by 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) or 15-LOX, 13-hydroxy-octadecatrienoic acid (13-HOTrE), 10,17-DiHDoHE, 15-hydroxy-eicosapentaenoic acid (15-HEPE), 9-hydroxy-octadecadienoic acid (9-HODE), 9-oxo-octadecadienoic acid (9-KODE), 13-HODE, and 15-hydroxy-eicosatrienoic acid (15-HETrE) were positively correlated with the turquoise module. Because the turquoise module is enriched in lung functions, metabolites in the 5- and 15-LOX pathway may be potentially associated with lung tissue function. Furthermore, 12-keto-LTB4, 6-trans-LTB4, 8,12-iso-isoprostane F2 α-VI-1,5-lactone (8,12-iso-iPF2a-VI-1,5-lactone), 8-iso-13,14-dihydro-15-keto-PGF2a, and 14,15-dihydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid (14,15-DiHETE) were significantly increased by MT relative to IVI and positively correlated with the blue and green modules. Thus, these lipid mediators might be associated with macrophage cells induced by MT.Figure 4Correlation between gene expression networks and the lipid mediator profile. (a) Correlation between modules detected by WGCNA (blue, green, and turquoise) and lipid mediator profile. Correlations between the gene expression profile and the lipid mediator profile, which was used as trait, were analyzed by WGCNA.

We have extended previous research, conducting a more comprehensive analysis of the effect of MT on the host response induced by IVI by examining lipid mediator and gene expression profiles at 5 dpi in a mouse model of IVI with MT treatment as summarized in Table 1.Table 1 Summary of effect of maoto on host response in influenza virus infection.Full size tableLipid mediators are associated with and ameliorate pathogenesis in IVI4,5. For example, Tam et al.4 previously examined the changes in lipid mediators in bronchoalveolar lavage during IVI, showing that a lethal infection resulted in an increase in ω-3 FA-derived lipid mediators at 5 dpi, which is consistent with the trends observed in our data. We further showed that MT tended to increase these mediators. Because ω-3 FA-derived lipid mediators generally play a role in modulating inflammation, the enhanced response of the ω-3 FA-derived lipid mediators in the infected state may be part of the host defense response to infection. Therefore, these observations may suggest that MT improves the lipid mediator profile, and this endophenotype seems to correlate with a prolonged survival period.Our analysis of lipid mediator profiles in lung further identified two types of responses of lipid mediators associated with MT treatment. The first type of response, which involved lipid mediators normalized by MT during the infection, was associated with the IVI-induced immune response (cluster A, B and D in Fig. 2a). The second type of response was associated with an MT-induced specific immune response (cluster C in Fig. 2a). Several lipid mediators increased by MT at 5 dpi were located on pathways involved in the immune response to protect against and reduce influenza viral load, such as LTB436,44, which regulates type 1 interferon signaling and interstitial macrophages36, and PGJ2 as a source of 15-deoxy-delta-13,14-PGJ237. Furthermore, 10,17-DiHDoHE (also known as PDX or protectin D1) improves severe influenza virus infection, bleomycin-induced lung dysfunction and lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury5,38,39. Thus, MT seems to enhance pathways associated with both specific proinflammatory factors and SPMs, which contribute to protection against IVI and resolution of inflammation. Lipid mediators are known to switch class as acute inflammation progresses to resolution. In the early stages of acute inflammation, lipid mediators activate neutrophils to promote phagocytosis, but then switch to recruitment of macrophages. PGE2 and PGD2, which tended to be increased by MT, ultimately activate resolution-type lipid mediators such as lipoxins, resolvins, and protectins, leading to the elimination of inflammation8. Although not all resolution-type lipid mediators were identified, our finding that MT increased 10,17-DiHDoHE at 5 dpi suggests that MT enhances the transition from acute inflammation to resolution. Maintaining the augmentation of lipid mediators may accelerate recovery. Our previous study found that MT is a crude drug mixture that alters many lipid mediators upon intake. Such augmentation of the dynamics of the lipid mediator profile may contribute to the relief of symptoms.Regarding the lipid mediator profile in plasma, we observed that IVI caused an increase in AA-derived lipid mediators, which was then reduced by MT treatment at 5 dpi. Because these lipid mediators are generally known as inflammatory factors, MT might suppress systemic inflammation by suppressing such lipid mediators. Several lipid mediators were significantly increased by MT, including 12,13-epoxy-octadecenoic acid (12,13-EpOME), 6-keto-PGF1α, 14,15-dihydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid (14,15-DiHETE), and 8-hydroxy-docosahexaenoic acid (8-HDoHE), while those decreased by MT were 9,10-dihydroxy-octadecenoic acid (9,10-DiHOME) and 18-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (18-HETE). Although the causes of these alterations by MT are unclear, the lipid mediators identified in plasma may be useful as biomarkers of the MT effect.In our previous study using a rat model of PIC-induced acute inflammation, the prostaglandins and leukotrienes induced in plasma were reduced by MT at 2 h after treatment, suggesting that MT alters the host inflammatory response at an early phase of infection. Because the PIC injection model is considered to partially mimic the host response to virus, it is possible that MT might regulate the host response profile in IVI in a similar manner. That is, in the early phase of viral infection, MT may affect the systemic lipid mediator response for prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Subsequently, in the sub-acute or late phase of the infection, it may modulate the broader ω-6 and ω-3 FA-derived lipid mediator response, providing a comprehensive host immune response and intervening in viral replication. In this study, we only examined the effects at 5 dpi; therefore, we can only hypothesize about the dynamics of the switch in lipid mediator class reflecting the intervention of MT in the host response.In the transcriptome analysis, gene expression associated with type I interferon, neutrophils and macrophages was induced by influenza infection, consistent with a previous study on transcriptome analysis in IVI45. In the early phase of infection, the phagocytotic activity of macrophages is essential to reduce the virus, and subsequently tissue-resident macrophages play a role in tissue repair. However, prolonged activation of macrophages derived from circulating monocytes promotes alveolar injury46. Our data suggest that the proinflammatory response induced by infection and the enhanced inflammatory response associated with acute lung injury were maintained until 5 dpi.Cell type enrichment analysis showed that MT upregulated specific genes associated with macrophages and T cells, many of which seemed to be involved in migration and activation. This finding corresponds with that of a previous study of MT (ma huang tang) on H1N1 infection, which showed that MT significantly improved infection-induced lung injury, significantly decreased CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and increased the ratio of CD4+/CD8+ T cells23. Although the immune cell population needs to be confirmed, these results suggest that MT modulates macrophage and T-cell dynamics, ameliorates the pathology induced by IVI, and repairs lung tissue.In addition to the interferons and cytokines that MT modulates, we found that MT affect the gene networks for bradykinin and kallistatin maturation. In this pathway, tissue kallikrein is a vital molecule associated with regulation of alveolar macrophages and protection against influenza virus infection47. This pathway would have an essential role in the ameliorative effect of MT.Furthermore, we found a correlation between the IVI-induced and MT-affected gene networks and lipid mediator response, whereby AA-derived lipid mediators and DHA-derived lipid mediators were positively correlated with the immune response induced by the viral infection, and lipid mediators in the 5-LOX or 15-LOX pathway associated with lung tissue-specific genes tended to be decreased by infection and improved by MT. This result suggests that the dynamics of the lipid mediator profile may reflect an improvement in the pathology. In particular, 12-keto-LTB4, which was positively correlated with a macrophage cell type by CTen, was significantly increased by MT (Fig. 4). Parnet et al.36 previously showed the LTB4 is closely associated with type 1 interferon and alveolar macrophage function, which is consistent with our lipid mediator and gene network analysis of MT. This may infer that MT enhances the LTB4 pathway and affects alveolar macrophage function and the associated gene network pathways such as type I interferon, before shifting the lipid mediator class towards pro-resolution, which leads to its ameliorative effects.On the other hand, 10,17-DiHDoHE was correlated with the T-cell enriched module, which suggests that 10,17-DiHDoHE may be associated with the effects of MT via the T-cell response and tissue repair. The role of SPMs such as 10,17-DiHDoHE, which was increased by MT, has received much attention8. Furthermore, the metabolic pathway from DHA to 17-HDoHE is closely associated with the production of not only 10,17-DiHDoHE but also other SPMs, resolvins, although the latter lipids were not detected in the present study. These results suggest that MT may tilt the balance towards the pro-resolving phase and accelerate the recovery period in influenza infection by regulating the immune system.In summary, we have shown that MT has the potential to ameliorate influenza virus infection by altering specific host responses. By modulating the host immune response, MT might be an effective treatment for influenza virus infection that would be free from the problems of drug resistance, unlike other antiviral drugs that directly target viral proteins. In our integrated analysis of lipid mediators and gene expression, along with cell type analysis, the group of genes associated with lipid mediators suggested that MT influences the activity of specific immune cells. Thus, the overall effect of MT on host lipid mediator response might be a synergistic action between anti-virus activity and amelioration of the systemic damage due to IVI. In particular, our results regarding the lipid mediators and immune cell groups induced upon infection confirm the observations of previous studies.Zheng et al. previously reported that the combination of a neuraminidase inhibitor (zanamivir), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor (celecoxib), and anti-inflammatory drug (mesalazine) led to an improvement in lethality as compared with a single treatment of zanamivir in cases of IVI with delayed initiation of treatment48. While it will be important to clarify the dynamics of the effect of MT on the host response against IVI in future research, MT affects multiple targets and ameliorates the symptoms of influenza as multi-compound herbal medicine. In addition, the study identified lipid mediators in plasma, which may be potential candidates as a biomarker to verify the effect of crude drug administration, once the connection between lipid mediator profiles in lung and plasma is confirmed. Lastly, although our study confirmed the effect of MT administration on the 5th-day post-infection, there are some limitations of this study. While we elucidated dynamic alteration of gene expression associated with immune response, we further need to reveal the details of immune cells affected by maoto. The mechanism of action of maoto that triggers the host response during the initial administration remains to be evaluated by examining a time-dependent analysis of host responses against IVI coupled with MT treatment. Given that maoto is a multi-compound herbal medicine, it is vital to elucidate the synergetic effect of active ingredients in maoto to reveal the specific mechanism of action of maoto as a long-tail drug. Finally, we should integrate the response of the complex host, virus and multi-compound response using systems biology and network pharmacology10,49,50,51. These approaches have been applied to reveal the complex interaction between endogenous factors and multi-compound of traditional medicines for kinds of disease such as influenza, cancer, type 2 diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis52,53,54,55,56. Applying the approach is valuable to elucidate the overall mode of action of maoto and for repositioning of maoto to related disease. Furthermore, understanding how maoto modulates host inflammation response and immune response gives essential information not only for the anti-influenza virus activity but also therapeutic potential against other acute infectious diseases, and excessive inflammatory response such as cytokine storm.MethodsThe detailed methods were shown in supplementary methods.MaterialsMaoto is an extracted mixture of Ephedrae Herba (32.3%), Armeniacae Semen (32.3%), Cinnamomi Cortex (25.8%), and Glycyrrhizae Radix (9.6%). Dry powdered extracts of MT were supplied by Tsumura & Co. (Tokyo, Japan). Maoto was dissolved in distilled water before administration to mice.Virus cultureMouse-adapted influenza virus [A/PR/8/34(H1N1)] (PR8) was used to infect mice. The influenza virus was cultured in Madin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, and PR8 collected from the culture medium was used for intranasal inoculation of mice.AnimalsFemale BALB/c Cr Slc mice purchased from Japan SLC, Inc. (Shizuoka, Japan) were used from 6 weeks of age after habituation. The mice were housed in groups under the following conditions: room temperature, 19–24 °C, relative humidity, 40–70%, and 12-h light–dark cycle (6:00–18:00). All experiments were approved by the Laboratory Animal Committee of Tsumura & Co. and Nihon Bioresearch Inc. (Hashima, Gifu, Japan), and performed in accordance with guidelines for the conduct of animal experiments in ministry of health, labour and welfare, Japan.In vivo influenza virus inoculationInfluenza virus (1 × 105 PFU/0.05 mL/mouse) was administered by intranasal inoculation. Maoto (0.5 or 2 g/10 mL/kg) was orally administered for 5 days starting 1 h after inoculation. Mice with no inoculation were used as control mice against the infection, and infected mice that were treated distilled water were used as infected control mice. In total, there were four groups of mice: (1) no-inoculation (NI) group; (2) influenza virus inoculation (IVI) control group; (3) IVI with MT 0.5 g/10 mL/kg treatment [IVI + MT(L)] group; and (4) IVI with MT 2 g/10 mL/kg treatment [IVI + MT(H)] group. Daily body weight and clinical signs of each mouse were recorded. Clinical signs were divided into four categories, eye, fur, behavior and other (hypothermia, emaciation and respiratory failure), which were individually scored from 0 (normal) to 4 (death). The scores of the four categories were averaged per treatment group and the total clinical sign score was obtained. Rectal temperature was measured by using a thermometer (Physitemp, Model BAT-12, Physitemp Instruments Inc.).Ten mice from each of the four mouse groups were used to record the survival period. Another 10 mice in each group were sacrificed at 5 dpi to collect tissue and plasma samples for analysis of viral titer, histopathological findings, transcriptome analysis, and lipid mediator analysis.Tissue samplingLung tissues and plasma were collected at 5 dpi. Blood was collected and the plasma sample was stored at –80 °C. The lung tissue was scored for macroscopic findings by area of consolidation as follows: 0, no consolidation; 1, consolidation area < 1/3; 2, consolidation area 1/3 to 1/2; 3, consolidation area 1/2 to 2/3; 4, consolidation area > 2/3. The score increased with the severity of lung injury. The right lung tissue was used for evaluation of viral titer, transcriptome analysis, histopathological analysis and lipid mediator analysis.Influenza viral titerThe amount of influenza virus in infected mice was titrated by plaque assay. Right lung tissue was homogenized in Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (Life Technologies Corporation) and diluted in Minimum Essential Media (MEM, GIBCO). An aliquot (0.1 mL) of lung homogenate solution was added to an MDCK culture plate (12-well-plate) and incubated for 1 h. The cells were cultured for 2 days in culture equipment at 5% CO2 and 37 °C. After the incubation period, the number of the viral plaques was counted.Histopathological analysisThe left lung tissue fixed by formaldehyde was embedded in paraffin block, sectioned, and stained hematoxylin and eosin for histopathological analysis. Hyperplasia/hypertrophy of bronchial mucosal epithelium, degenerationecrosis of bronchial mucosal epithelium, infiltration of mononuclear cells and polymorphonuclear leukocytes in bronchus and alveolar septum, exudation of mononuclear cells and polymorphonuclear leukocytes atelectasis, edema and hemorrhage were scored. The score increased with the severity of findings.Wide-targeted lipid mediator analysisSample preparationLipid mediators in plasma samples were extracted by following a previously described solid-phase extraction (SPE) liquid chromatography (LC)–mass spectrometry (MS)/MS method16. In brief, 100 µL of plasma sample was mixed with 1 mL of methanol containing a mixture of internal standards (0.5 ng/μL each of tetranor-PGE metabolite (PGEM)-d6, thromboxane B2 (TXB2)-d4, PGE2-d4, PGD2-d4, leukotriene C4 (LTC4)-d5, LTB4-d4, 5-hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid (5-HETE)-d8, and 15-HETE-d8; 0.25 ng/μL of oleoylethanolamide-d4; and 10 ng/μL of AA-d8; all from Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) for 5 min at room temperature. After centrifugation, the supernatant was diluted with 4 mL of 0.1% formic acid in water and loaded onto the preconditioned SPE cartridge (STRATA-X, 10 mg/1 ml, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA) with 1 mL each of 0.1% formic acid and 15% ethanol. The lipids were eluted with 250 μL of 0.1% formic acid in methanol. The extract was evaporated to dryness in vacuum evaporator and dissolved in 20 μL of methanol. Aliquots of 5 µL were injected into the LC/MS system.Ice-cold methanol was added to the frozen lung sample (20 mg tissue/mL) and homogenized by Automill (TK-AM7-24, Tokken Inc.) for 30 s. Lung samples spiked with a mixture of internal standards were agitated at 4 °C for 60 min and then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C (Model 3740, Micro Refrigerated Centrifuge, KUBOTA). After centrifugation, the supernatants were loaded onto SPE cartridges and separated as described for plasma samples.LC–MS/MS analysisAnalyses were carried out with a Shimadzu Nexera X2-UHPLC system coupled to a Shimadzu LCMS-8050 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. A reversed-phase column (Kinetex C8, 2.1 × 150 mm, 2.6 μm, Phenomenex) was used for chromatographic separation. Comprehensive analysis was performed by using LC–MS solution software and the LC–MS/MS Method Package for Lipid Mediators version 2 (Shimadzu). Metabolomics data were processed by using Excel software (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA). Missing values in the raw data were replaced by half of the minimum positive value, and these data were used for subsequent statistical analysis. The lipid mediator pathways were visualized by using VANTED software (https://www.cls.uni-konstanz.de/software/vanted/)57.Gene expression microarray analysisTotal RNA of lung tissue was isolated by using QIAzol (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) with an RNAeasy kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Microarray analysis was performed in accordance with the method reported by Akane et al.58. Gene expression analysis was performed by using a SurePrint G3 Mouse GE microarray (8 × 60 K v. 2.0) (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) The gene expression data were normalized and processed by GeneSpring GX (Agilent Technologies). The raw signal intensity was normalized by a 75% percentile shift. The probe ID was summarized in Entrez Gene ID, and the gene level intensity was used for analysis.Weighted gene co-expression network analysisFor all genes detected in gene expression microarray analysis, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was conducted to identify gene modules associated with normal, IVI, and IVI plus MT conditions by R59 on the Garuda platform (www.garuda-alliance.org). The minimal gene number in the module was set as 50. The soft-thresholding power for scale-free topology was calculated; we obtained a power of soft threshold (β = 10) that satisfied more than 0.9 of the square of the model fitting index R (Fig. S4b).Cell type enrichment analysisThe cell type specificity of the gene set was analyzed by cell type enrichment (CTen) analysis (http://www.sbi.jp/influenza-x/cten)60. To analyze the module-specific cell type, the genes in each module were first individually input and the result obtained. We then input the gene sets that differed significantly between IVI and IVI + MT (P < 0.05 and FC > 1.5) in each module to analyze the effect of MT on cell type specificity. The CTen analysis for DEG was conducted using the gene set obtained from comparison between IVI and NI, and IVI + MT and IVI, respectively. To analyze the effect of IVI on NI, gene sets significantly increased or decreased by IVI relative to NI at criteria of P < 0.05 and log2FC > 3 or P < 0.05 and log2FC < –3 were used. To analyze the effect of maoto on IVI, gene sets significantly increased or decreased by MT relative to IVI at criteria of P < 0.05 and log2FC > 1 or P < 0.05 and log2FC < –1 were used. The enriched cell types were obtained at the criteria of enrichment score (-log10 Benjamini–Hochberg adjusted P) > 2.Pathway enrichment analysisThe pathway enrichment analysis for gene set in modules obtained by WGCNA and gene set obtained by DEG was conducted by using MetaCore software (ver. 6.11, build 41105, (Clarivate Analytics, USA, New York) (https://clarivate.com/products/metacore/). The gene sets significantly increased or decreased by IVI relative to NI at criteria of P < 0.05 and log2FC > 3 or log2FC < -3 were used for the analysis. The gene sets significantly increased or decreased by IVI + MT relative to IVI at criteria of P < 0.05 and FC > 1.5 or FC < -0.67 were used for WGCNA, and log2FC > 1 or log2FC < -1 were used for DEG. The enriched pathways at criteria of FDR < 0.05 and associated with viral infection, immune response and inflammation response were selected.Statistical analysisThe statistical significance of differences in rectal temperature, body weight, viral titer and lipid mediator were determined by Welch’s t-test with Bonferroni’s multiple comparisons. Differences in histopathological score were evaluated by Mann–Whitney U test with Bonferroni’s multiple comparisons, and those in survival and clinical signs were determined by Log-rank test. The data were analyzed and visualized by using GraphPad Prism7 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). The significance level for each statistical analysis was set at P < 0.05.The statistical significance of differences in lipid mediators was determined by Welch’s t-test with Bonferroni’s correction for multiple comparisons of the group using Excel software. The clustering analysis of lipid mediators was performed by using Metaboanalyst (https://www.metaboanalyst.ca), 61 and the data were visualized as a boxplot by ggplot2 in the R software package.In transcriptome analysis, differential expression genes were analyzed by moderated t test with Benjamini Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) multiple testing corrections using GeneSpring GX. The significance level was set at p < 0.05 and fold change criteria, which are mentioned in each analysis, were used as a threshold for enrichment analysis.

The association between NT1 and HLA-DQB1*06:02:01 supported the view of the vaccine as an etiological agent. A/H1N1 hemagglutinin (HA) is the main antigenic determinant of the host neutralization antibody response. Using two different immunoassays, the Luciferase Immunoprecipitation System (LIPS) and Radiobinding Assay (RBA), we investigated HA antibody levels and affinity in an exploratory and in a confirmatory cohort of Swedish NT1 patients and healthy controls vaccinated with Pandemrix. HA antibodies were increased in NT1 patients compared to controls in the exploratory (LIPS p = 0.0295, RBA p = 0.0369) but not in the confirmatory cohort (LIPS p = 0.55, RBA p = 0.625). HA antibody affinity, assessed by competition with Pandemrix vaccine, was comparable between patients and controls (LIPS: 48 vs. 39 ng/ml, p = 0.81; RBA: 472 vs. 491 ng/ml, p = 0.65). The LIPS assay also detected higher HA antibody titres as associated with HLA-DQB1*06:02:01 (p = 0.02). Our study shows that following Pandemrix vaccination, HA antibodies levels and affinity were comparable NT1 patients and controls and suggests that HA antibodies are unlikely to play a role in NT1 pathogenesis.

Between October 2009 and early 2010, to implement protective measures against a novel influenza pandemic, Sweden offered to the entire population free influenza-vaccination with Pandemrix, a vaccine containing components from inactivated A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)v-like strain (X-179A) flu virus plus adjuvants. Following this Pandemrix vaccination, a 5–14 fold increase in incidence of narcolepsy type 1 (NT1) in children and adolescents was confirmed in Sweden and other European countries1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. An increased incidence of NT1 following the 2009 pandemic, was also reported in China without a relation to vaccination10,11,12,13. NT1 is a rare sleep disorder that results from the degeneration of brain hypothalamus-restricted hypocretin neurons14, with this specific cell loss causing unstable transitions between wakefulness and sleep stages. The causes and triggering mechanism behind this specific hypocretin cell-death are not well defined15,16. With a typical young age at onset and an almost complete association with the HLA-DQB1*06:02:01 allele, implying a connection to antigen-presentation17,18, NT1 is assumed to be the likely consequence of an autoimmune process.The Pandemrix vaccination, as an unexpected and time-restricted trigger could provide new knowledge into the processes underlying the disease. Previous European studies measuring antibodies against non-structural protein 1, a protein present in the wild-type pandemic virus that was not included in the Pandemrix vaccine, did not observe an association between humoral immunity to the 2009 influenza pandemic virus and NT119,20. Prior studies instead linked the vaccine-induced NT1 to the antibody response against influenza nucleoprotein (NP), that is present in structurally altered forms in the Pandemrix formulation21, and reported a potential molecular mimicry with the hypocretin receptor 222, as well as a lower affinity of antibodies from NT1 patients’ sera recognizing the NP-PR1934 (the influenza nucleoprotein variant present in the Pandemrix vaccine)20.However, it is acknowledged that hemagglutinin (HA) is the major antigenic determinant during an influenza infection. Suggestions of T cell mediated molecular mimicry between HA and hypocretin have been investigated with conflicting conclusions23,24,25,26,27,28,29. In this study we analysed the antibody response to HA with respect to Pandemrix vaccination in NT1 patients and healthy vaccinated Swedish residents in an exploratory cohort of samples collected in 2012, and a second replicatory cohort of samples from additional NT1 patients and their family members collected in 2015–2017.We measured HA antibodies using the Luciferase Immunoprecipitation System (LIPS) and Radiobinding Assay (RBA), two alternative immunoassay formats widely adopted for the study of autoantibodies, i.e. assays that are more likely to detect antibodies to conformational epitopes30,31,32. We previously showed that an RBA test, using 35S-radiolabled HA expressed in vitro by coupled transcription, detected increased HA antibodies levels among NT1 patients in the exploratory cohort as well as an association of HA antibodies with HLA-DQB1*06:0218. In light of the different antigen expression system adopted by LIPS, which yields a trimeric post-translationally modified HA, we used the two assays to explore: first, if the HA antibody association to NT1 was found only in samples collected close to the time of vaccination with Pandemrix, or persisted also in confirmatory cohort of patients collected at a later time-point; second, if the antibody affinity of the HA response might differ between NT1 patients and control; and third, if systematic differences in results could be found and traced to the type recombinant antigens used in the two assay formats.ResultsAntibody levelsA/H1N1 HA antibody levels were determined in patients and controls from both the exploratory and confirmatory study cohorts. Comparisons were performed separately for LIPS and RBA and antibody titres were found to be non-normally distributed. A/H1N1 HA antibodies were similar in range but with modestly increased median levels among narcolepsy patients compared to control subjects in the exploratory cohort both in LIPS (median arbitrary units (AU): 77,874, IQR: 24,834–182,371 vs. 37,942, IQR: 19,560–92,347, p = 0.0295) and in RBA ( median U/ml: 75, IQR: 39–185 vs. 50, IQR: 29–114, p = 0.0369) (Fig. 1a). However, levels were comparable between NT1 patients and family member controls from the confirmatory cohort both in LIPS (median AU: 44,965, IQR: 16,727–109,043 vs. 41,219, IQR: 17,123–80,778, p = 0.55) and in RBA (median U/ml: 62, IQR: 40–227 vs. 64, IQR: 36–115, p = 0.625) (Fig. 1b).Figure 1Raincloud plots of A/H1N1 HA antibody levels in subjects from the exploratory and the confirmatory study cohorts, determined using LIPS and RBA.

Panels show results from the exploratory (a) and the confirmatory (b) study cohorts. P-values are indicated between the compared groups.Full size imageAgeA/H1N1 HA antibody levels measured by LIPS were investigated in relation to age. In the exploratory cohort, we observed a modest inverse correlation of HA antibody levels with age in both cases and controls (R2 = 0.092 and 0.16, respectively). This finding was replicated in the confirmatory cohort ((R2 = 0.24 and 0.16, respectively). Our prior findings33 suggested that differences in antibody levels were most prominent in children aged less than 13 years. Accordingly, we stratified the study subjects into two age groups: children (< 13 years) and adolescents/adults (≥ 13 years). Upon stratification, we observed that HA antibody levels measured by LIPS in healthy controls were higher in younger vs older subjects in both study cohorts (Mann–Whitney p = 0.00386 and p = 0.0037) (Table 1). HA antibody levels were higher in younger vs older NT1 patients but this difference reached statistical significance only in the confirmatory cohort (p = 0.020). Compared to controls belonging to the same age group, HA antibody levels in NT1 patients were higher only in the exploratory cohort (Mann–Whitney p = 0.0419 not corrected).Table 1 A/H1N1 HA antibody levels in relation to age.Full size tableLIPS vs. RBA comparisonsAntibody levels were compared between LIPS and RBA. In the exploratory cohort, antibody titres correlated both in the patients (rho = 0.370, p = 0.0151) as well as the controls (rho = 0.303, p = 0.0152). In the confirmatory cohort, antibodies correlated significantly only in patients (rho = 0.664, p = 6.98e-05) but not in controls (rho = 0.203, p = 0.141) (Supplementary Figure S1).HLAA/H1N1 HA antibody levels were compared between subjects carrying the HLA-DQB1*06:02:01 allele and non-HLA-DQB1*06:02:01 individuals. Increased antibody levels were related to HLA-DQB1*06:02:01 in LIPS (80,618 LU, n = 54, 37,523 LU, n = 47, p = 0.02) but not in the RBA, and only in the exploratory study (Supplementary Table S1).HA antibody affinityThe affinity of HA antibodies was evaluated in LIPS and RBA in a selection of sera from the exploratory cohort. Kd50 was determined by displacement of antibody binding using increasing concentrations of Pandemrix vaccine (Fig. 2). Since HA antibody titres were often near or at the saturation limit of our assays, all selected samples were diluted to achieve comparable levels of binding within the linear range of the assays. Kd50 were comparable between patients and controls in the LIPS (NT1: 48 ng/ml vs. control: 39 ng/ml, p = 0.357) and the RBA (NT1: 472 ng/ml vs. control: 491 ng/ml, p = 0.632) (Table 2a, Fig. 3a). Maximal displacements were higher for controls in the LIPS but comparable between the groups in the RBA (LIPS: NT1 97.2% vs. control 98.0%, p = 0.036, RBA: NT1 86.6% vs. control 89.7%, p = 0.99) (Table 2b, Fig. 3b).Figure 2Displacement analysis of A/H1N1 HA antibodies binding in a subset of subjects from the exploratory cohort.

Note the different x-axis scales.Full size imageDiscussionThe report of increased narcolepsy cases following a nationwide vaccination programs with the Pandemrix flu vaccine in Sweden and Finland emerged in August 2010, with the full scope of its association with influenza vaccination surfacing in 2011–2012. The vaccine had never received approval by the FDA for distribution in the USA and the concern for the safety of its administration led to the effective discontinuation of all vaccination programs using Pandemrix in Europe and other countries after 2012 and eventually to the expiry of its marketing license in 2015.The mechanistic association between narcolepsy and Pandemrix vaccination has proven contentious. In light of the predominant hypothesis that narcolepsy has an autoimmune origin, the specific formulation of inactivated viral components and adjuvant in the Pandemrix vaccine has been suspected of triggering the disease in genetically predisposed young individuals34 via the induction of autoimmunity to self-proteins via molecular mimicry. However, some of the evidence previously published regarding this point has not withstood scrutiny35, leaving essentially unresolved the link between Pandemrix vaccination and narcolepsy development.To contribute towards a better understanding of the immune response in patients that developed narcolepsy after a Pandemrix vaccination, in this and previous studies we explored whether the antibody response to the flu antigens included in the vaccine formulation was quantitatively or qualitatively different from controls.In this work in patients that developed the disease soon after the 2009 nationwide program in Sweden, we not only expand the number investigated of these rare subjects but also addressed the concern that methodological differences might impact the evaluation of flu antibodies. In particular, we explored how the characteristics of recombinant antigen used in two different immunoassays affected the measurement of antibodies to HA, a protein that in its native state has trimeric quaternary structure and is subjected to important glycosylation as a post-translational modification.Using a novel LIPS immunoassay based on a recombinant trimeric HA antigen expressed in eukaryotic cells, in the original exploratory cohort we were able to replicate our previous observation of a broadly similar range of HA antibodies with modestly increased median levels in narcoleptic patients compared to control. In addition, HA antibodies measured by LIPS were higher in subjects carrying the HLA-DQB1*06:02:01 allele irrespective of disease status. In the second confirmatory cohort instead, we found no statistically significant difference neither in range, distribution and median HA antibody levels in NT1 patients compared to family member controls using either LIPS or RBA assays. This observation suggests that, if present, the original modest increase in median HA antibody levels might have been limited to a relatively brief temporal window after vaccination. In addition, the enrichment of HLA-DQB1*06:02:01 alleles in the family members vs the general population (72 vs 28%, respectively) might have affected the comparison HA antibodies between case and control. Overall, while observing a range of HA antibodies broadly similar in their distribution using both immunoassays, the partial correlation of binding between LIPS and RBA was suggestive of the likely detection of partially different epitopes by the two systems.It is known that HA has a complex expression profile, with different versions of the protein present during an infection cycle, as well as major differences in glycosylation patterns that affect immune responses. The HA 3D-structure on viral particles guides antibody responses to some epitopes while hinder the exposure of others, for example in the HA stem-regions. Most studies and diagnostic procedures often prioritize simplicity and inexpensiveness of antibody assays over a thorough assessment of how immunoglobulins (vaccine- or infection induced) that bind recombinant proteins recapitulate the humoral response recognizing native antigens. In fact, the choice and type of recombinant protein adopted in immunoassay can have a major impact results when measuring antibodies including those associated with virus induced responses in a disease36 or vaccination setting.In our study, while the impact of the addition of a nanoluciferase reporter on the protein structure was not assessed, both the adopted expression system and the addition of a trimerization foldon domain to the chimeric antigen were previously shown to lead to a post-translationally modified, trimeric, structurally stable recombinant HA protein that was similar to its native counterpart. Moreover, in addition to an improved antigen protein-folding, the intrinsic high luciferase activity of the NanoLuc reporter was likely associated with the observed increased sensitivity of the HA antibody LIPS compared to RBA.Using both immunoassays in experiment of binding displacement using Pandemrix vaccine as a competitor, we determined that HA antibodies showed a comparable affinity in NT1 patient and control sera. This was in contrast to our previous study in which we observed a lower affinity of NP antibodies in NT1 patients using RBA and non-PTM NP radiolabeled antigen. Importantly, in the previous study commercially available NP proteins were used to displace antibodies instead of the Pandemrix vaccine itself20 as in the current study. Since Pandemrix comprises polymorphic and structurally altered NPs21, vaccination might have driven the emergence of antibodies that would be more difficult to displace using commercial NP antigens produced in alternative systems.Among the limitations of our study we can count: first, the lack of information regarding the HA antibody status prior to the Pandemrix vaccination in both study cohorts, and second, the fact that patients in the confirmatory cohort were sampled in 2015–2017 i.e. a few years later compared to the exploratory cohort sampled in 2012. In the absence of additional NT1 samples collected soon after the Pandemrix vaccination, we resorted to use these samples to analyse a larger number of these very rare patients. The difference in timing of collection might have impacted on the correlation between HA antibodies and disease. In particular, the possible exposure to the pandemic flu virus in the intervening years after the vaccination might have constituted a potential confounder of immunological results. It cannot be excluded that the characteristics of dominating flu strains circulating in the years following the vaccination, including their antigenicity and sequence divergence, might have been shifted in between the sample collection of the exploratory and confirmatory cohorts. For this reason and in the absence of sequential samples from the same subjects, as mitigatory measure, we enrolled in the confirmatory cohort patients’ family members as control, reasoning that any potential exposure to a flu virus infection in NT1 patients would have been at least more likely to have affected control samples from the same family and to be synchronous. Re-immunization due to additional vaccination in both patients and family members was instead deemed unlikely, also because of the absence of state sponsored flu vaccination programs in Sweden before or after the 2009 pandemic except for the elderly.Nevertheless, the comparable results obtained using two alternative immunoassays, of which one is ideally suited to the measurement of antibodies to conformational epitopes, make us we believe that our study main outcomes are valid: (1) quantitative differences of HA antibodies in NT1 patients compared to control were very modest and observed only in samples obtained relatively close to the vaccination (2) the affinity of HA antibodies did not differentiate NT1 patients from control.In conclusion, while our results suggest that the HA antigen is unlikely to play a role in the association between Pandemrix vaccination and increased incidence of NT1, the mechanistic explanation of this relationship remains elusive.MethodsStudy populationsThe current project included two narcolepsy cohorts: an exploratory and a confirmatory study group. All patients developed disease following the 2009-autumn Pandemrix vaccination and before the end of sample collection in 2012. The exploratory cohort consisted of 43 Pandemrix vaccinated NT1 patients and 64 matched population controls collected in 2012, as previously described20,33. The median age of patients in October of 2009 (start of vaccination) was 17 years (range 6–69 years, inter-quartile-range 12–27 years). Compared to our previous study, that included 47 patients and 80 controls, we excluded 4 patients and 16 controls who were not vaccinated with Pandemrix. The confirmatory cohort consisted of 31 Pandemrix vaccinated NT1 patients and 54 first-degree relatives as control, collected in 2015–2017 in collaboration with the Swedish Narcolepsy Association as previously described18,37. Patients were asked by questionnaire for year and month of acquired disease. Based on 22 answers, the median age was 15.5 years (range 6–70 years, inter-quartile-range11,75–19.5 years). No patients or controls were shared between the study-cohorts. In contrast to our previous study, that included 31 patients and 66 first-degree relatives, we now excluded 12 controls who were not Pandemrix vaccinated. The study was approved by the Regional Ethical Review Boards in Lund (Sweden) and Stockholm (Sweden), and conducted in accordance with the current guidelines. The informed consent was obtained from all participating subjects and/or their legal guardians.Determination of antibody affinityTo quantify the affinity of HA antibodies we used serum samples from the exploratory cohort, of these 60 were analysed conducting binding displacement experiments in LIPS and 41 in RBA. The discrepancy in the tested subjects is explained by the lower antibody levels measured by RBA that precluded the conduction of displacement experiments since at the lower displacement concentration the signal would be comparable to background noise. One control-sample was excluded from calculations in the RBA as displacement did not reach 50% as required for determination of Kd50.LIPSThe influenza A virus (A/California/04/2009/(H1N1)) hemagglutinin HA1 coding sequence corresponding to amino acid 1–344 was subcloned into a modified pCMVTnT-vector upstream of and in frame with a modified NanoLuc luciferase reporter (Promega, Madison WI, USA) tagged at the COOH terminus with a T4 foldon trimerization domain38. A recombinant trimeric luciferase-tagged HA1 recombinant antigen was then expressed by transient transfection of the plasmid into Expi293F cells (Expi293 Expression System, Thermo Fisher Scientific Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) followed by harvest after 48 h with Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega). The recombinant trimeric luciferase-tagged HA1 was then kept frozen at − 80 °C as single-use aliquots.For the LIPS assay, the thawed antigen was diluted in 20 mM Tris Buffer, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% Tween-20, pH 7.4 (TBST) buffer, filtered with a Durapore PVDF 0.45-μm Millex-HV syringe filter (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) and adjusted for its luciferase activity to a final concentration of 4 × 106 Light Units (LU)/5 μl. 1 μl replicates of each serum were incubated with 5 μl of antigen preparation into 96-deep-well plates (Beckman Coulter Inc., Brea, CA, USA) for 2 h at RT.Immunocomplexes were captured with 2.5 μl of blocked39 rProtein A (GE Healthcare Europe GmbH, Freiburg, Germany) for 1 h at 4 °C with shaking. Plates were washed 5 times by dispensing 750 μl/well of TBST, centrifugation at 500 g for 3′ at 4 °C, and removal of supernatant using a micro-plate plate washer (BioTek Instruments Inc., Winooski, VT, USA). Resin pellets were transferred to an OptiPlate 96-well plate (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA) and the luciferase activity was measured after addition of 40 μl/well of Nano-Glo substrate (Promega), followed by a 2 s/well readout in a Berthold Centro XS3 Luminometer (Berthold Technologies GmbH & Co. KG, Bad Wildbad, Germany). Raw data were converted to Arbitrary Units (AU) using a positive serum as index. Sera that bound recombinant H1N1 above the linear range of the assay were serial diluted and re-tested until binding fell into the linear range, and calculated AU were corrected by multiplying for the corresponding dilution factor.Antibody binding displacement experiments were performed by adding to test reactions Pandemrix vaccine in increasing amounts, corresponding to final concentrations of 0, 0.004, 0.008, 0.04, 0.4 and 4 μg/ml.In vitro transcription translation and RBAThe influenza A virus (A/California/04/2009/(H1N1)) HA gene (GeneBank accession: FJ966082) was subcloned into the pTnT-vector to enable in vitro transcription translation for expression of [35S]-methionine radiolabelled antigen as previously described33,40. The TnT SP6-coupled reticulocyte lysate system was used for protein-synthesis, and the protocol included 90 min incubation at 30 °C followed by size-restricted selection of protein-product using Nap-5 columns.In brief, the RBA included analyses of 2.5 μl serum in duplicate. Radiolabelled proteins were diluted in assay buffer (Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.4), 0.15% (v/v) Tween 20, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin) to 400 counts per minute (cpm)/μl, and a total of 60 μl were incubated overnight with each serum sample. Immunoprecipitation was performed through addition of 50 µl protein A Sepharose to 50 μl antigen-sera sample on filter plates. Incubation, 60 min, were followed by 3 washes using Tris-buffered saline ((pH 7.4), 0.15% (v/v) Tween 20). Analyses were performed in Wallac Microbeta Trilux beta counter following addition of 50 μl Super-mix scintillation cocktail. Antibody levels were presented as in-house arbitrary Units/ml (U/ml).Displacement experiments were performed using RBA as described above but with additional analyses included with increasing concentration of Pandemrix vaccine (0, 0.004, 0.008, 0.04, 0.4 and 4 μg/ml). The vaccine was diluted to twice the desired concentration in assay buffer, and then mixed 50/50 with radiolabelled proteins (800 cpm/μl) to obtain final concentration.HLA genotypingHLA-DQB1*06:02 association in the exploratory study were determined using TaqMan assay with SNP rs9271366 (GG DQB1*06:02/, DQB1*06:02, AG DQB1*06:02/ nonDQB1*06:02 and AA nonDQB1*06:02/ nonDQB1*06:02).HLA-DQB1*06:02 association in the confirmatory study were determined using HLA high resolution sequencing with Illumina MiSeq as previously described18.Statistical analysisAll statistical analyses were performed using the R software41 (https://www.R-project.org). Comparisons of median antibody titres across groups were performed using the Mann Whitney U test. For age stratification, ages in the confirmatory cohort were re-calculated back to October 2009, i.e. the initiation of Pandemrix vaccination in Sweden. The correlation between LIPS and RBA antibody titres was assessed using the Spearman’s coefficient of rank correlation test (ρ (rho)). Affinity was calculated through the determination of the half-maximal binding Kd50 (ng/ml). A four-parameter log-logistic function was constructed with y = D + (A − D)/(1 − (x/C)^D) as previously described using the drc package20,42 (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=drc). The significance threshold (a) was set to 0.05 for all tests.

Register ADVERTISEMENT Horses are susceptible to a number of viral and bacterial diseases for which the equine industry has produced safe and effective vaccinations. | Photo: Kevin Thompson/The Horse Navigate the complex world of vaccine types, mutations, and efficacy At the threshold of the paddock I paused, in awe of what I was witnessing. A beautiful dun Morgan mare lay flat on the ground, her devoted owners hovering over her, holding an umbrella to shield her from the baking sun. The mare would try to sit sternal with great effort. With a lumbering heave, she’d hoist herself up on her front legs just enough that her owners could help her flip to the other side. Her limp hind legs were useless, completely paralyzed. Despite not understanding what was happening to her, she had enough survival instinct to try to roll over to relieve weight on her lungs and huge haunch muscles. I’d seen horses with similar clinical signs— hallmarks of West Nile virus (WNV) encephalitis, which had recently emerged and spread across the United States. Subsequent blood tests confirmed WNV infection. While this mare did not have the advantage of a vaccine to keep her safe, today we have at least four vaccines licensed to protect horses against WNV, along with many others to guard against the variety of diseases they face. Let’s look at the science behind the routine use of immunizations for our horses. Why Are Vaccine Programs Important? David Horohov, PhD, director of the Maxwell H. Gluck Equine Research Center at the University of Kentucky, in Lexington, is renowned for his work with equine immunity against a variety of pathogens (disease-causing organisms). “Infectious diseases remain a major cause of concern in both human and veterinary medicine,” he says. “As the current COVID-19 pandemic so dramatically demonstrates, the introduction of an infectious agent into a susceptible population can have devastating consequences. The purpose of a vaccine is to stimulate a protective immune response that either prevents infection or limits seriousness of disease.” Horses are susceptible to a number of viral and bacterial diseases for which the equine industry has produced safe and effective vaccinations. “Vaccines really come into their own if enough individuals in a population are vaccinated to achieve herd immunity,” says Janet Daly, BSc, PhD, FHEA, FRCPath, professor of viral zoonoses at the University of Nottingham School of Veterinary Medicine and Science, in the U.K. Herd immunity is the theory that when a high proportion of individuals in a population develops immunity against an infectious disease after previous infection or vaccination, the spread of that disease slows. So, the more horses you vaccinate within a herd, the fewer cases you’ll see in unimmunized animals. Herd immunity occurs when the number of immunized individuals exceeds 75% and preferably ranges from 83-94%, says Daly. “In these circumstances, outbreaks can be prevented and so everyone benefits, including individuals that respond poorly to vaccination,” she adds. In equine medicine, veterinarians recommend administering core vaccines annually to every horse. These include immunizations against Eastern and Western equine encephalomyelitis, tetanus, WNV, and rabies. Horses might also require risk-based vaccines such as those against influenza, leptospirosis, rhinopneumonitis, strangles, botulism, and Potomac horse fever. Whether a veterinarian recommends a risk-based vaccine for a horse depends on the animal’s likelihood of being exposed to the particular disease, as determined by geography, travel, season, and congregation with other horses. Daly points out that some diseases we vaccinate against, such as influenza, are rarely fatal, yet some individuals can develop serious complications from infection. Herd immunity is the theory that when a high proportion of individuals in a population develops immunity against an infectious disease, the spread of that disease slows. So, the more horses you vaccinate within a herd, the fewer cases you’ll see in unimmunized animals. | Photo: iStock Types of Vaccines Vaccines come in several forms, the most common of which are inactivated (killed) or modified live (attenuated). Inactivated vaccines contain relevant components of a disease agent, but they are treated with heat or chemicals to quell their pathogenicity, or disease-producing capacity. Killed pathogen vaccines are fairly easy to manufacture, relatively inexpensive, and won’t cause disease, says Daly. A killed vaccine presents the horse with the inactive proteins (antigens) necessary to generate an antibody response. The viruses or bacteria in modified live virus vaccines are capable of reproducing in the horse, but their pathogenicity has been reduced and isn’t likely to cause disease. These vaccines stimulate a more pronounced and longer-lasting response to immunization than killed vaccines. “Although uncommon, there is a risk with some live attenuated vaccines that they could ‘revert’ to virulence to cause disease, particularly in an immune-compromised individual,” says Daly. The main advantage of using “live” antigens, says Horohov, is that the vaccine better imitates the natural immune-stimulating process to generate an optimal protective immune response. “This is particularly important when a naive (not previously exposed) individual is vaccinated for the first time,” he says. “It is less important for horses with either prior exposure to the disease, or their history includes routine vaccination against that disease. However, we have relatively few live-agent vaccines available for horses.” The most common modified live vaccines are the intranasal equine influenza vaccine and the intranasal strangles vaccine. Manufacturers also use recombinant technology to produce some equine vaccines. On its website the American Association of Equine Practitioners explains how these are engineered in various ways: Live attenuated vector vaccines incorporate pathogenic antigens into a harmless virus or bacteria; Chimeric vaccines substitute genes from a pathogen for similar genes in a safe but closely related organism; and DNA vaccines consist of a DNA plasmid (a small DNA molecule found in bacteria and other cells) that encodes a viral gene that is then expressed in the horse following immunization. When a vaccine contains more than one kind of antigen—such as the five-way Eastern and Western encephalomyelitis, tetanus, influenza, and rhinopneumonitis vaccine many veterinarians give in the spring—it’s referred to as a combination vaccine. Horohov and Daly agree that combination vaccines offer convenience and cost savings compared to separating each disease antigen into individual vaccines, given one at a time with multiple sticks and/or veterinary visits. Both list occasions when a single-antigen vaccine might be necessary: when a horse has a history of an adverse reaction to a combination vaccine, for example, or when it is necessary to vaccinate against a specific pathogen due to exposure in an outbreak, such as with equine influenza. Vets also commonly administer vaccines containing just one or a limited number of antigens (e.g., rhino/flu, rabies, Potomac horse fever) to provide comprehensive protection while keeping the horse’s welfare in mind. Viral Mutation Certain diseases develop strategies to evade detection by the immune system, such as through “plasticity” of their genomes, says Horohov. “This is best exemplified by influenza viruses, which use RNA as part of their genome compared to DNA molecules of mammals. Replication of RNA (which is how viruses proliferate once they’ve infected host cells) is much more error-prone compared to DNA(that tends to correct error), leading to a greater likelihood for mistakes or mutations to occur during viral replication.” “High rates of replication in RNA viruses are like writing out text from a book lots of times very rapidly without the opportunity to correct any mistakes,” Daly explains. “Lots of subtly different virus particles are made during infection of one individual. Over time, the virus (variants circulating in exposed populations) may develop subtle outward differences from virus strains used in vaccines in a process called ‘antigenic drift.’ This eventually means that antibodies raised against the vaccine virus or from a previous infection no longer recognize and neutralize the virus that is circulating in the field.” Changes in the RNA sequence that alter the virus’ structure might allow it to escape the host’s immune response, adds Horohov. Such mutations are passed on to replicating virus generations and lead to the emergence of new circulating virus strains. When this happens manufacturers must reformulate the target vaccines to include that ‘new’ mutated protein to elicit a host response. “Fortunately, the equine influenza virus evolves more slowly than human influenza so equine vaccine strains do not need to be updated quite as frequently,” says Daly. While human influenza vaccines are updated annually, equine influenza vaccines are only updated when the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) publishes new recommendations, which occurs infrequently, says Horohov. Vaccine Frequency You might be aware that your small animals only need to be immunized against certain diseases every three years. “Sufficient evidence has been accumulated for routine vaccination with core vaccines in dogs and cats,” says Daly (which, aside from rabies, are a different set of diseases). While immunizing small animals every three years against certain pathogens appears to provide adequate protection, other agents require annual administration. “Most (small animal) vaccines have been through extensive trials of monitoring antibody levels over time to determine the interval at which revaccination is required based on how rapidly antibody levels decline and/or how well animals are protected when challenged with the pathogen at different intervals after vaccination,” she continues. “Studies such as these are difficult and costly to perform in horses.” While corresponding duration of immunity (DOI) data are not available for most equine vaccines, Horohov says that generally the level of antigen-specific antibodies in a horse’s circulation, measured in blood serum as a titer to the agent of interest, tends to decrease fairly rapidly post-vaccination. “Depending upon the magnitude of the initial antibody response to the vaccine, disappearance of detectable antibodies from the circulation may occur within a year’s time, if not sooner,” he says. “While antibody titers themselves are not always predictive of protection, it is assumed that disappearance of circulating antibodies is a likely sign of increased susceptibility to infection, and this dictates the need to revaccinate or booster frequently, according to manufacturer directions.” During the initial licensing of a vaccine, manufacturers base their prescribed dosing method and frequency on experimental data they’ve obtained in studies using historical methods to induce immunity and assess protection. “Typically, this involves administration of an initial priming dose, followed two to four weeks later by a second dose (a booster) of the same vaccine,” Horohov says. “This may be repeated based on other data that show when maximal antibody responses are obtained and a vaccine’s ability to stimulate an antibody response. A few weeks after the last vaccine dose is administered, challenge studies—exposure of the horse to the disease agent—are performed at the time when the expected maximal antibody response occurs. While it would be ideal that antibody titers would correlate with protection—something owners do ask about—this is not always the case.” Titers Are Not the Answer The major limitation in using titers to determine if a horse needs immunization has to do with protective immunity’s complex nature, says Horohov. He explains that the immune system responds to antigens in two ways—by producing antibodies (humoral immunity) and attacking antigens that have breached the cells (cellular immunity). When protective immunity involves cellular immunity, antibody titers provide little useful information. Another reason titers aren’t helpful for measuring protection against diseases has to do with where the immune response must happen in the body to be protective, Horohov adds. A horse is best protected against a respiratory virus such as influenza when the immunization response is localized within the respiratory tract, for instance, which he says is one reason why intranasal vaccines work well. “While there is some association between antibody titers in the blood and those present in the respiratory tract, it does not correlate well in terms of protection,” he says. “For many infectious diseases, the nature of the protective immune response remains poorly described, making it impossible to define what correlates with protection.” We have become complacent about what can be achieved by vaccination. Dr. Janet Daly Vaccination Pros and Cons “Vaccines have received a lot of bad press in recent years,” says Daly. “There is no such thing as a perfect vaccine, but they can make the difference between life and death. Overall, vaccination is far less costly and stressful than infection. Sometimes a horse develops a reaction to a vaccine, such as heat and swelling at the site of vaccination—this is a sign that the body’s immune system has been provoked into action. Major adverse reactions are, thankfully, relatively uncommon.” In some cases the adjuvant—a vaccine ingredient used to modulate or amplify the immune response—is the culprit that evokes an adverse vaccine reaction. Sometimes, modifying the product or trying a different manufacturer’s vaccine can help mitigate such reactions. “We have become complacent about what can be achieved by vaccination,” says Daly. “For example, many people today are unaware of the devastating impact childhood diseases had before routine immunization became available. Unfortunately, vaccine-preventable diseases are on the increase due to vaccine hesitancy in both human and pet populations.” Take-Home Message You probably wondered what happened to the mare in the introduction. She received every medication option and veterinary medical support, with the owners giving round-the-clock care to roll her every couple of hours and provide her with food, water, bedding, and shade. Her paralysis lasted four days. The morning they planned to have her humanely euthanized, 96 hours into her crisis, she stood up, shook herself, and miraculously recovered thanks to a robust immune system. She is one of the lucky ones; typically 40% of horses with WNV don’t survive. A few remaining neurologic deficits persisted until the end of her life a decade later, but nothing that precluded her from being ridden. It is a desperate story with a happy ending, but how much better of a story had she been immunized and not contracted this disease in the first place. As guardians of your horses, it helps to take advantage of every medical advancement that provides them with quality of life and longevity. Equine vaccines are protective in most cases, with very little downside to their use. Horohov draws parallels between the immune system and the musculoskeletal system: “By exercising our horses regularly and building up strength in their muscles and bone, they can perform athletics at an optimal level. The same is true for the immune system. By ‘exercising’ the immune system through the routine use of vaccination, we allow our horses to optimally resist the infectious disease agents they may encounter.” Share Nancy S.
