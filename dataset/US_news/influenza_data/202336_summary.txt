Highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) has been detected in marine mammals and seabirds in Peru.
The H5N1 viruses found in Peru belong to lineage 2.3.4.4b and are reassortants with genetic segments from both the Eurasian and American lineages.
These viruses are rapidly accumulating mutations, including mutations of concern.
Local surveillance and active management of outbreaks are urgently needed to prevent further spread, including potential spillover into humans.
