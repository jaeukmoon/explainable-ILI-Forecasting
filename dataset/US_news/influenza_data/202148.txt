Among these, the recombinant influenza vaccine tetravalent (RIV4), using a baculovirus expression vector system to express recombinant haemagglutinin (rHA) in insect cells, is the only one to have reached the market and has been studied extensively. We describe how the unique structural features of rHA in RIV4 improve protective immune responses compared to conventional influenza vaccines made from propagated influenza virus. In addition to the sequence integrity, characteristic of recombinant proteins, unique post-translational processing of the rHA in insect cells instills favourable tertiary and quaternary structural features. The absence of protease-driven cleavage and addition of simple N-linked glycans help to preserve and expose certain conserved epitopes on HA molecules, which are likely responsible for the high levels of broadly cross-reactive and protective antibodies with rare specificities observed with RIV4. Furthermore, the presence of uniform compact HA oligomers and absence of egg proteins, viral RNA or process impurities, typically found in conventional vaccines, are expected to eliminate potential adverse reactions to these components in susceptible individuals with the use of RIV4. These distinct structural features and purity of the recombinant HA vaccine thus provide a number of benefits in vaccine performance which can be extended to other viral targets, such as for COVID-19.

In the USA, influenza was thought to account for 52.7 hospitalisations per 100,000 people during the 2019–2020 season. These numbers are significantly higher in young children and adults aged 65 and older1,2,4. Extra-pulmonary complications of influenza infection constitute a further under-recognised disease burden4,5. Overall, such a high disease burden carries substantial social and economic cost6,7. Prevention of seasonal influenza epidemics, as well as preparedness for future pandemics, is thus a global priority.Influenza A subtypes H1N1 and H3N2, and influenza B lineages B/Yamagata and B/Victoria circulate routinely in humans and are included in seasonal influenza vaccines8. Influenza A subtypes can also give rise to highly pathogenic viruses through cross-over from animal reservoirs to humans9. In the past century, four novel influenza A virus strains have emerged in this way, each leading to a global pandemic (H1N1 in 1918; H2N2 in 1957; H3N2 in 1968; and H1N1 in 2009). Vaccines against such strains are prepared and stockpiled as government initiatives for emergency use in potential future pandemics.Haemagglutinin (HA) is the primary antigen in the induction of a protective immune response against the influenza virus, and thus a key vaccine target. Expressed as trimeric glycoproteins on the viral surface, HA binds to sialic acid on target cells to facilitate host cell entry and mediates the fusion of the viral envelope to the late endosomal membrane. Neutralising antibodies that block HA effectively prevent viral entry into target cells and have been shown to protect the host from infection10,11. Another viral surface protein, neuraminidase (NA), cleaves sialic acid and releases budding virus from the infected cells, thus serving as another important vaccine target. Although the presence of NA is not required for effective vaccine performance12, its inclusion in annual influenza vaccination may help to broaden protection and reduce influenza severity13,14.The preparation of the annual influenza vaccine firstly requires the identification of the influenza strains and their like strains, most likely to spread during the upcoming season, for inclusion in the vaccine. Identification of the target influenza strains is based on surveillance data collected by World Health Organization (WHO) collaborating centres at six locations in the UK, USA (including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC]), Japan, China and Australia as part of the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS)15. The final decision on resulting vaccine targets is made by individual regulatory bodies.Influenza vaccines can afford significant protection against influenza illness, even when there is an antigenic mismatch against the predominant circulating virus strains16,17. Such cross-protection can occur through the priming of the immune system by vaccination or natural infection and is primarily due to antibodies specific to conserved regions on the HA head and stem18. Vaccines that can induce immunity specific to circulating wild-type strains and cross-protection to related strains would be ideal against constantly evolving influenza viruses. As such, the conserved regions on the HA head and stem present attractive targets for development of universal influenza vaccines19,20.The annual production of influenza vaccine through conventional, mostly egg-based platforms, is arduous and a race-against-time21. The production process, from the selection of influenza strains to vaccine manufacture and release for distribution, takes eight to nine months each year. Agile, reliable and egg-free technologies allowing for guaranteed and faster manufacture of influenza vaccines are needed to ensure timely delivery for upcoming epidemic seasons and during potential avian flu pandemics, when egg supply may be impacted. The adoption of alternative vaccine development approaches (including mRNA, vector, and recombinant protein strategies) in the urgent response to the COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the feasibility of using more efficient methods to produce new, effective vaccines within accelerated development timelines. The recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4, Flublok®, Supemtek® [EU, Canada], Sanofi Pasteur) was the first licensed influenza vaccine to be produced using recombinant viral proteins instead of antigens derived from live influenza virus (as for inactivated split-virion and subunit vaccines). RIV4 is an unadjuvanted vaccine containing 45 µg of HA/dose from each of the four strains. The production of RIV4 is based on a novel production platform in which recombinant HA (rHA) is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS)22. In brief, expresSF+ insect cells are infected with recombinant baculovirus carrying the relevant influenza HA genes, which are expressed under the control of a baculovirus polyhedrin promotor. rHA molecules from the infected cells are extracted using detergent and purified from the clarified cell extract using column chromatographies followed by Q membrane filtration. Purified rHA is suspended in relevant buffer using tangential flow filtration and passed through sterile filtration for storage and formulation22. RIV4 has undergone extensive clinical assessment23, and was first approved by FDA in 2013. It is now licensed in the USA, Canada, Europe, Australia, and various other countries.This review focuses on the structural features of BEVS-derived rHA that make RIV4 unique from conventional vaccines, and how these features help to maximise vaccine performance. Notably, the benefits of this manufacturing process can be extended to other viral targets, such as COVID-19, where the preservation of conserved epitopes is critical for imparting cross-protection against a constantly evolving and mutating virus.Potential antigenic mismatch of influenza vaccine virus grown in egg or cells due to adaptive mutations in the HA primary structureA known risk of traditional split or subunit vaccines is the potential for the candidate vaccine virus or working virus seeds to acquire adaptive mutations as they grow in embryonated chicken egg or mammalian host cells during vaccine manufacture. Such adaptive mutations in HA peptides may reduce the effectiveness of the resultant vaccine24,25,26. Raymond et al.24 showed that an egg-adapted A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) vaccine strain acquired a mutation resulting in the substitution of glutamine with arginine at position 226 which in turn induced antibodies specific to receptor binding site that bound to vaccine-derived HA preferentially over the circulating wild-type virus24. During the 2012–2013 northern hemisphere influenza vaccination campaign, HA from an egg-adapted A/Victoria/361/2011 (H3N2) virus used for vaccine manufacturing differed from the WHO-recommended prototype and several other wild-type influenza viruses in three positions, H156Q, G186V, and S219Y25. The low vaccine effectiveness (41%) observed for H3N2 in the 2012–2013 season was attributed to these three mutations during vaccine production25. Other antigenic mutations introduced by egg-adaptation of the vaccine strain during vaccine manufacturing are thought to have contributed to low vaccine effectiveness estimates for H3N2 in other influenza seasons26,27.Lower vaccine effectiveness estimates have been observed for H3N2 than for other strains since 2009, even during seasons when the selected vaccine strain appeared to be well matched to circulating strains27. Differences in HA glycosylation between the vaccine strains and circulating strains are thought to have contributed to this reduced vaccine effectiveness26. During the 2014–2015 influenza season, a clade 3 C.2a H3N2 strain possessing a new predicted HA glycosylation site emerged26. For the 2016–2017 season, the influenza vaccine was updated to include a clade 3 C.2a H3N2 strain (A/Colorado/15/2014) containing the new glycosylation site26. However, this particular glycosylation site was absent in the egg-adapted virus. Consequently, antibodies induced in humans, and in ferrets, poorly neutralised the glycosylated clade 3 C.2a H3N2 strain26. Contrary to the egg-derived vaccines and as expected, rHA containing the new glycosylation site induced optimal levels of antibodies that efficiently recognised the glycosylated clade 3 C.2a H3N2 virus26. The chances of introducing deleterious mutations through the adaptation of seed virus during vaccine manufacturing today are low due to the stringent quality control of the working seed virus. Indeed, as per current regulatory requirements, seed viruses must be confirmed for both genetic and antigenic match with their originating wild-type virus before they can be used for vaccine production. Nonetheless, the time it takes to generate appropriate seeds could hinder the timely availability of the vaccines.Recombinant DNA technology avoids the risk of the virus acquiring egg- or cell-adapted mutations during the manufacturing process as it does not use ‘live’ influenza virus. Instead, DNA coding for HA is cloned from a reference virus published in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database and is confirmed for fidelity at the working virus bank level28. As such, the primary amino-acid sequence of the rHA produced using baculovirus or other recombinant expression system is identical to the HA from the wild-type virus isolate selected for seasonal influenza vaccine production. Thus, the risk of antigenic mismatch of RIV4, or other rHA vaccines in development, with the wildtype influenza strain selected for vaccines is eliminated.Recombinant HA expression systemsBoth prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression systems have been used for the manufacture of rHA vaccine antigens. The first candidate recombinant influenza vaccines to be successfully manufactured using an Escherichia coli fermentation system involved expression of the globular head domain of the HA protein genetically fused with the Toll-like receptor 5 agonist, Salmonella typhimurium flagellin type 229. The resultant vaccines elicited strong and protective antibody responses in mouse models29. In Phase 1 clinical evaluation, a prototypic quadrivalent vaccine developed using this E. coli platform elicited immune responses in healthy adults with favourable tolerability30. The E. coli expression system has been shown to generate a high yields of rHA (200 mg/L of purified HA protein) using a minimal number of bioreactors31. The authors projected that the strategy could yield up to half a billion doses of vaccine per month in a medium-scale pharmaceutical production facility31. This approach will likely shorten the entire vaccine manufacturing process32. However, E. coli-expressed rHA proteins can be subject to mis-folding, contain impurities (e.g., host-cell proteins), and do not undergo glycosylation33. They therefore need extensive processing to attain desired purity and to fold to their native conformation31. The resulting processed proteins are less immunogenic than egg-derived antigens, with around a 10-fold greater quantity needed to generate protective immunity in animal models31. These inherent complications have prevented large scale manufacturing and eventual commercialisation of E. coli-expressed influenza vaccines.Vaccines containing plant-derived rHA either in soluble form or in virus-like particles (VLPs) have been shown to be safe and immunogenic in humans34,35,36,37. A plant-derived recombinant quadrivalent VLP (QVLP) at 30 µg dose per strain was found to be non-inferior in terms of vaccine efficacy against respiratory illness and influenza-like illness to a quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (QIV; Fluarix Quadrivalent, GlaxoSmithKline) given at 15 µg dose/strain in adults aged 18 to 64 years37. However, inconsistency in the expression levels of target proteins, due to nonspecific integration of transgene(s) into the host genome, has been a major challenge with plant-based expression systems34. The unpredictable yield could adversely impact timely vaccine production, which typically involves updating at least one HA component of the vaccine to reflect antigenic change in the circulating influenza viruses each season. A unique positive attribute of plant-derived rHA is that it can stimulate innate immunity that predominantly facilitates Type 1 pro-inflammatory cellular immune responses, potentially as a direct effect of the plant-origin lipids/glycolipids in the vaccine formulation38. These stimulatory components in a plant-derived vaccine may need to be controlled and kept at a constant level, for commercialisation, to avoid potential severe adverse events caused by enhanced immune responses in vaccinees.Several groups have explored the use of adenovirus (AdV), primarily as a replication-defective vector, for gene delivery and transgene expression of rHA in the host cells. AdV vectors induce both cell-mediated and humoral immunity against the expressed protein, providing robust protection against the targeted disease39,40,41. However, pre-existing or acquired immunity against adenovirus can hamper vaccine effectiveness by neutralising the vaccine vector and clearing the vector-infected cells. While the use of non-human adenovirus vectors could potentially overcome this issue, AdV vector immunity developed through repeated immunisation (for example during repeated annual influenza vaccinations) can dampen the immune response against the vaccine antigens39,40.RIV4 is one of only two available influenza vaccines that are egg-free. Like other recombinant vaccines, expression of HA in insect cells does not depend on the generation of reassortant candidate vaccine viruses selected for robust growth in embryonated eggs or mammalian cell-lines. Instead, HA genetic sequences from the wild-type strains selected for inclusion in the vaccine are inserted into the BEVS, from which high yields of rHA are harvested and purified (Fig. 1). This process requires less than half the time (2–3 months) required for the manufacture of conventional influenza vaccines42,43. This is a critical advantage for the timely supply of influenza vaccine for both seasonal epidemics and in pandemic situations. VLPs have been produced successfully by integrating HA, capsid protein (M1) and neuraminidase (NA) expressed in insect cells44,45,46. Although presenting proteins in VLP structures enhanced their immunogenicity, it compromised the purity of the vaccines considerably, as VLP structures also integrated both baculovirus and Sf9 cell proteins. Elimination of these unwanted proteins from the vaccine required extensive disassembly and reassembly processing of purified VLPs, which is a constraint for the commercial scale manufacturing of vaccines annually. It also raises the cost and the time it takes to bring the vaccines to the market. The yield and the cost of various manufacturing processes and technologies are critical elements to ensure adequate supply of vaccine at an affordable cost, especially in a pandemic situation. This aspect of the vaccine manufacturing has been discussed exhaustively in a report published by the Program for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH) and is not covered here47.Fig. 1: Generation of rHA using the baculovirus-insect cell expression system for the manufacture of RIV4.BV baculovirus.

J Invertebr Pathol 107 Suppl, S31-41 © 2011 Elsevier Inc, with permission from Elsevier23.Full size imageInsect cell-derived rHA (RIV4) has been studied extensively by various groups in both pre-clinical models and humans. The rHA contained in RIV4 differs from that expressed in other systems in terms of specific structural features, the nature of the source material and the manufacturing process, which have an impact on certain aspects of vaccine safety and efficacy (Fig. 2). Based on these unique features, RIV4 received ‘product exclusivity’ protection from FDA, a ‘new active substance’ designation from EMA Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP)48 and an ‘innovative drug’ designation from Health Canada49. The use of this technology, together with the molecular characterisation of the product, should facilitate continued evolution of influenza vaccines with improved effectiveness and their timely availability to the public.Fig. 2: Structural features of native HA expressed on influenza virus and rHA produced in insect cells using the baculovirus expression vector system.a HA protein (shown as monomer) extracted from influenza virus is a heterodimer comprising HA1 (turquoise) and HA2 (orange) linked though an inter-disulfide (S–S) bond and contains complex-type sialylated N-linked glycans. Cleaved fusion peptides (green) and complex glycans74 eliminate and mask unique epitopes on HA respectively. b Recombinant HA protein (shown as monomer) expressed in insect cells as a single precursor polypeptide (HA0) with amino acid sequence identical to wildtype HA sequence and contains unsialylated paucimannosidic N-linked glycans74. HA0 is coloured in turquoise and orange to show HA1 and HA2 segments combined as a single polypeptide. Uncleaved fusion-peptide loop (green) and simpler glycans preserve and expose unique epitopes on rHA.Full size imageThe tertiary structure of recombinant HA produced in insect cells can influence vaccine immunogenicityInfluenza HA is synthesised as a single precursor polypeptide (HA0), which is generally cleaved into two polypeptides (HA1 and HA2) extracellularly by trypsin-like serine proteases, furin and other subtilisin family endoproteases after newly synthesised virions are released from infected cells50,51. HA cleavage is essential for the infectivity of influenza virus. Thus, expression of these proteases exclusively in the respiratory tract is responsible for influenza virus tropism to epithelial cells of the upper and lower respiratory tract. However, HA from influenza subtypes H5 and H7 contains multi-basic cleavage sites that are cleaved by ubiquitously expressed furin in the trans-Golgi network, making these strains highly virulent50,52,53. The HA1 and HA2 polypeptides remain covalently linked by a disulfide bond to form heterodimers (Fig. 2). These molecules, either uncleaved HA0 or cleaved HA1–HA2 heterodimers, are expressed on the viral membrane surface as trimers (HA ‘rosettes’). The conversion of HA0 to HA1–HA2 heterodimers leads to conformational changes that render the molecule fusion-competent, thus enabling the virus to infect a new host cell52,54. In inactivated (split and subunit) vaccines, the HA molecules derived from live influenza viruses are present predominantly as HA1–HA2 heterodimers. By contrast, the rHA included in RIV4 is designed to yield predominantly as a single HA0 polypeptide (Fig. 2). A previous biochemical study (using SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions) clearly demonstrated the predominance of HA0 in recombinant HA H7 subunit complexes, produced using a BEVS, with no protein bands indicative of HA1 or HA2 molecules55. Poor processing of HA0 to HA1 and HA2 polypeptides in Sf9 cells has been shown to be due to insufficient levels of furin-like proteases in the cells56.The conformational differences between pre-fusion and post-fusion states of HA and the process of exposure of the fusion peptide have been well described54. Webster et al.57 demonstrated, using monoclonal antibodies, that neutralising epitopes present in the pre-fusion HA0 molecule were lost upon conversion to the post-fusion HA1–HA2 heterodimer at an acidic pH57. Similarly, several broadly neutralising antibodies directed against the highly conserved HA stem region have been shown to block HA maturation and fusion58. Some of these antibodies are likely to bind near the uncleaved fusion peptide that protrudes at the surface of the HA0 rosettes. Turner et al.59 identified a monoclonal antibody that binds to an epitope on HA molecules that are partly and transiently exposed in the pre-fusion conformation59. Structural analysis of the antigen-antibody complex revealed a potential dynamic state where HA undergoes structural fluctuations in its pre-fusion state59. A recent study by Khurana et al.60 further demonstrated, using surface plasmon resonance technology, that the observed broader specificity of antibodies induced by RIV4 may be linked to the presence of unique epitopes on HA060. Additionally, several groups have isolated, using HA0 as the immunogen or from a phage display library, protective antibodies specific to epitopes in the fusion loop region present only in HA061,62. These antibodies exhibited unprecedented breadth and potency and neutralised a diverse panel of representative viruses in group 1 and group 2 influenza A, blocked protease cleavage of HA0 and locked HA in the pre-fusion state. Thus, these antibodies make the virus non-infectious by inhibiting the pH-induced conformation change and the HA-mediated membrane fusion that are essential for the virus infectivity. HA molecules presented on influenza virions are predominantly in the pre-fusion state. Once the virus binds to a cell or enters the acidic endosome of infected cells, the fusion loop is cleaved to yield HA1 and HA2, and the hydrophobic fusion peptide in the N-terminus of HA2 is sequestered away from membranes in a pocket, limiting its exposure52,63. Nonetheless, it would be of interest to examine the immunogenicity of released HA fusion peptides in the post-fusion state and their potential role in protection, as these are present in conventional influenza vaccines. Together, these critical findings clearly demonstrate structural differences between HA pre-fusion and post-fusion states, and the presence of unique neutralising epitopes in the pre-fusion HA0 molecules, which are present in RIV4 (Fig. 2).Structural differences in the HA polypeptides and rosettes between recombinant and split vaccines have been shown to result in differences, both qualitative and quantitative, in the immune response to vaccines in humans and animals. Portnoff et al.64 demonstrated that recombinant HA antigens (specifically for the H3 strain) produced using BEVS (as used for RIV4), induced significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of the HA head and stem domains than egg-derived split vaccines64. Recently Richards et al.65 examined CD4 T-cell and antibody responses in healthy adults who received egg-derived split vaccine, cell-derived split vaccine or RIV4 for three successive influenza seasons (2015–2016, 2016–2017, and 2017–2018)65. RIV4 elicited the most robust responses, with significantly higher T-cell and antibody levels than the other two vaccines. Authors postulated that simpler glycosylation of rHA and absence of other influenza viral proteins in RIV4 contributed to the observed robust immune response for RIV4 and emphasised the relevance of these features in determining vaccine efficacy and long-term immunity65.The homogeneity of recombinant HA antigens in RIV4 may improve the safety profile over conventional influenza vaccinesAs described above, HA is expressed on the viral surface as a HA trimer (rosette). When these are extracted from influenza viruses, they form clusters of varying sizes. This has been observed in conventional influenza virus-derived vaccines, with estimates of 18 to 1100 trimers per cluster55,66,67. Two distinct populations of cluster have been observed; the majority have an average diameter of 150 nm, while the remainder are larger (average diameter, 5500 nm)66. However, the rosette clusters in RIV4 are uniform in size and presentation, containing around six to eight HA trimers per cluster at an average diameter of approximately 30–40 nm55,67. The elution of rHA from RIV4 drug substance as a single peak in size-exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography is monitored for the release and the stability of RIV4.Further characterisation by cryo-electron microscopy has revealed that the HA rosette clusters in RIV4 are uniformly starfish-shaped; whereas in the split vaccine they are mostly non-symmetrical and agglomerated into huge structures, resulting in both starfish- and peanut-shaped heterogeneous particles55. Additional electron microscopy analysis of split vaccine clusters showed a highly heterogeneous mixture containing different types of viral particles containing HA and NA as well as split viral membrane folded in various shapes, slightly disrupted virions, and whole virions66.In Canada between 2000 and 2004, an unusual number of cases of a syndrome termed as oculo-respiratory syndrome (ORS) were reported following immunisation with the inactivated influenza split-virus vaccine68. Detailed analysis revealed that ORS, induced within 2 to 24 h of vaccination, was suspected to be due to the presence of micro-aggregates of unsplit virions in the conventional egg-derived influenza vaccines69. High levels of aggregate content in the split vaccine are believed to have induced a Type-2 polarised immune response resulting in ORS based on study results from a mouse model70. Although extremely rare, this is unlikely to occur with RIV4 that contains HA rosettes of small and uniform size.The N-linked glycan structure of recombinant HA produced in insect cells differs significantly from HA in other influenza vaccinesInfluenza HA has a variable number of N-linked glycosylation sites (depending on the virus strain and subtype) in the globular head region and the conserved stem region71. The glycosylation of HA has various functions, including regulation of the virus life-cycle and a role in disease pathogenesis71. During vaccine manufacture, the host cells used for the production of HA play a major role in determining HA N-glycan composition72,73. Glycoproteins expressed in mammalian cells typically have sialylated complex-type N-linked glycans, while those expressed in insect cells typically have simple unsialylated glycans (either truncated, paucimannosidic or oligomannosidic glycans)74. An et al.72 showed that egg-derived and mammalian (Madin-Darby canine kidney) cell-derived HA predominantly contained highly-branched complex or high-mannose glycans, whereas HA expressed in Sf9 insect cells had relatively small paucimannose glycans (Fig. 2)72.The peptide sequences around glycosylation sites are highly conserved and, as such, antibodies directed against these regions could provide broader specificity. Antisera raised against simple monoglycosylated HA in mice were shown to improve the breadth and capacity of HA-neutralising antibodies to protect against lethal challenge with H5N1 compared to antisera raised against fully glycosylated HA75. Thus, elimination of parts of glycans that are not essential for HA structure may improve vaccine-induced protection. Subsequent studies showed that HA with simpler glycans induce more broadly protective antibodies with superior cross-clade protection compared to HA with more complex glycans76,77,78,79. The presence of simpler glycans appears to be equally efficient to that of chicken or mammalian cell-derived glycosylation in ensuring the proper folding of HA, and exposes conserved regions of the molecule for the induction of immunity with broader protection12,71,76,77,78,79,80.In a study by Nachbagauer et al.78, RIV4 induced HA stem-specific neutralising antibodies directed against influenza subtypes H1, H3 and B haemagglutinin in an age-dependent manner in humans, with the highest titres observed in the elderly78. RIV4 also induces antibodies, in both humans and mice, that are specific to epitopes in the HA head region, at greater proportions than a traditional mammalian cell-derived subunit vaccine (Flucelvax® [Trivalent])77. Higher magnitudes of haemagglutination inhibitory antibody response against HA1 have also been observed with RIV4 compared to egg- or mammalian cell-derived split vaccines (Flucelvax® Tetra, Seqirus, and Fluzone® quadrivalent SD, Sanofi Pasteur)60. These data warrant additional studies to verify whether rHA elicits a broader antibody repertoire than conventional vaccines and whether this underlies the cross-protection against antigenic drift variants previously observed in clinical trials12,81.RIV4 has a unique ability to induce broadly cross-reactive antibody responses to antigenically drifted A/H3N2 viruses in humans. In a small study by Belongia et al.82, participants aged 65–74 years were immunised with RIV4, a high-dose split-virion inactivated trivalent influenza vaccine (Fluzone® High Dose, Sanofi Pasteur; HD-IIV3) or adjuvanted-IIV3 (aIIV3)82. Participant sera were tested against four A/H3N2 viruses including a cell-propagated reference vaccine strain, two circulating viruses and an antigenically advanced virus with evidence of antigenic drift. The post-vaccination geometric mean fold rise against the two circulating viruses was twice as high for RIV4 as for HD-IIV3 or aIIV3. Post-vaccination titre against the antigenically drifted H3N2 were generally low and similar across all groups, however, receipt of RIV4 was strongly associated with seroconversion to this strain (p = 0.003). The investigators suggested that although the circulating A/H3N2 viruses were antigenically similar to the cell-grown vaccine reference virus, egg propagation of the vaccine strains had led to loss of a glycosylation site and impaired antibody response to circulating viruses, consistent with previous reports26.In addition to the above referenced studies, in a recent study by Shinde et al.83 baculovirus-expressed rHA generated cross-protective responses against both circulating and drifted A/H3N2 strains, including in older adults who are at a higher risk for influenza and associated medical complications83,84. This unique characteristic of the recombinant vaccine is likely related to glycosylation of rHA in the insect cell line, leaving it uncleaved. The higher quantity and greater accessibility of the genetically conserved stem region of rHA produced in insect cells (resulting in smaller N-linked glycans) may contribute to cross-protection against mismatched influenza strains12,75. The study by Nachbagaeur et al.78 supports the hypothesis that a recombinant vaccine results in increased titre of broadly neutralising HA stem-reactive antibodies and that these immune responses increase with age78. This increase with age is possibly due to repeated exposure to divergent influenza viruses similar to the multiple A/H3N2 virus strains evaluated by Belongia et al.82. Therefore, vaccine constructs that preserve the highly conserved HA stem can protect against drifted viruses and thus may confer a greater breadth of protection against influenza.Recombinant HA antigens are not subjected to chemical modificationsIn all conventional influenza vaccines, whether derived from eggs or mammalian cells, the antigens are exposed to inactivation agents such as formaldehyde or β-propiolactone (BPL). These inactivating agents cause numerous modifications to the antigenic epitopes on HA through cross-linking or formation of bis-alkylated groups85,86,87. These modifications often result in changes to protein folding, conformation, and stability88. Unlike conventional vaccines, RIV4 does not go through an inactivation step, thus preserving the native HA conformation of the wild-type virus, required for optimal protective immune response.Absence of egg or other influenza viral components in recombinant HA vaccine is likely to favour its safety profileAs most split and subunit vaccines are prepared from influenza viruses that are grown in embryonated chicken eggs, they contain egg proteins. Testing of 58 vaccine lots covering six different seasonal influenza vaccines produced by five different manufacturers showed that the median ovalbumin concentration was 350 ng/mL89. Moreover, another study of commercial influenza vaccine preparations detected other viral proteins such as nucleoprotein and matrix protein (confirmed by a chromatographic separation) that are not shown to be relevant for vaccine effectiveness, and viral RNA fragments (confirmed by activity assay)90,91. Such egg-derived or other influenza virus-derived proteins (as described above) and influenza viral RNA fragments are not present in recombinant vaccines.Although uncommon, some individuals may be at increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions to component proteins such as ovalbumin and those who are sensitised may be at higher risk of clinical manifestations of allergic disease upon exposure92. Egg protein, viral RNA, and process impurities such as inactivating agents or hydrocortisone that are typically present in conventional vaccines are absent in RIV4 would eliminate potential adverse reactions, although rare, to these components in vulnerable individuals93.ConclusionsThe evidence reviewed here demonstrates several advantages of the BEVS used in the manufacture of RIV4 over conventional influenza vaccines that rely on influenza virions propagated in egg or mammalian cells, split with detergents with or without further HA enrichment. The use of recombinant protein technology eliminates the risk of antigenic mismatch due to potential changes in primary HA structure through egg- or cell-adaptation. We also describe features of the rHA tertiary structure that are likely to be responsible for the generation of broad cross-reactive and protective antibodies, together with the direct or indirect evidence supporting this. The homogeneity of rHA rosettes and negligible process-related impurities are the hallmarks of RIV4. As rHA production bypasses the need for a viral inactivation step and avoids the use of eggs, related process-impurities such as inactivating agents or residual egg-protein, and thus potential adverse reactions to these impurities in vulnerable individuals are eliminated. This well-established and validated platform for vaccine manufacture could be extended to address other emerging infectious diseases where cross-protection against constantly evolving variants is critical, such as pandemic influenza and/or COVID-19.

Many of the genes that were associated with these differences in the immune response to the flu are also enriched among genes that correlate with COVID-19 disease severity. The study was published on November 26 in Science. “The lab has been interested in understanding how individuals from diverse populations respond differently to infectious diseases,” said first author Haley Randolph, a graduate student at UChicago. “In this study, we wanted to look at the differences in how various cell types respond to viral infection.” Using single-cell RNA-sequencing, the researchers were able to examine gene expression patterns in peripheral mononuclear blood cells, a diverse set of specialized immune cells that play important roles in the body’s response to infection. They collected these cells from men of European and African ancestry and then exposed the cells to flu in a laboratory setting. This allowed the team to examine the gene signatures of a variety of immune cell types and determine how infection with the flu virus affected each cell type’s gene expression. The results showed that individuals of European ancestry showed an increase in type I interferon pathway activity during early influenza infection. “Interferons are proteins that are critical for fighting viral infections,” said senior author Luis Barreiro, PhD, Associate Professor of Medicine at UChicago. “In COVID-19, for example, the type I interferon response has been associated with differences in the severity of the disease.” What’s more, this increased pathway activation was correlated with greater capacity to hinder the replication of the virus and a greater capacity to limit viral replication at a later time point. “Inducing a strong type I interferon pathway response early upon infection stops the virus from replicating and may therefore have a direct impact on the body’s ability to control the virus,” said Barreiro. “Unexpectedly, this central pathway to our defense against viruses appears to be amongst the most divergent between individuals from African and European ancestry.” The researchers saw a variety of differences in gene expression across different cell types, indicating that the immune response variation can’t be isolated to a single type of immune cell, but rather connects a constellation of cells that work together to fight disease. Such a difference in immune pathway activation could contribute to disparities in influenza outcomes between different racial groups; Non-Hispanic Black Americans are more likely to be hospitalized due to the flu than any other racial group. However, the researchers are quick to point out that these results are not evidence for genetic differences in disease susceptibility. Instead, other environmental and lifestyle factors that may differ between racial groups could be influencing gene expression, which may in turn affect the immune response. “There’s a strong relationship between the interferon response and the proportion of the genome that is of African ancestry, which might make you think it’s genetic, but it’s not that simple,” said Barreiro. “Genetic ancestry also correlates with environmental differences. A lot of what we’re capturing could be the result of other disparities in our society, such as systemic racism and healthcare inequities. Although some of the differences we show in the paper can be linked to specific genetic variation, showing that genetics do play some role, such genetic differences are not enough to fully explain the differences in the interferon response.” These differences in susceptibility to viral infection may extend beyond the flu virus; When the researchers compared a list of genes associated with differences in the severity of COVID-19 disease, many of the same genes showed significant differences in their expression after flu infection between individuals of African and European ancestry. “We didn’t study COVID-19 patient samples as part of this study, but the overlap between these gene sets suggests that there may be some underlying biological differences, influenced by genetic ancestry and environmental effects, that might explain the disparities we see in COVID-19 outcomes,” said Barreiro. The researchers are exploring this and other related questions in more details. The hope, they say, is to figure out which factors contribute to the differences in the interferon response, and immune responses more broadly, to better predict individual disease risk.

Only a small number of countries, including Spain, the United Kingdom (UK), and the United States (US), have high Tdap and seasonal influenza VCRs in pregnancy. The purpose of this study was to identify the key factors that contributed to the high VCRs observed in these countries.MethodsThe experience from both Tdap and seasonal influenza vaccination programmes during pregnancy were documented in Spain, the UK, and the US using a three-step approach. A literature review yielded 157 publications, and a further 117 documents were selected through desk research. A published five-pillar VCR framework for influenza was amended to evaluate the specific contributing factors leading to high Tdap and seasonal influenza VCRs among pregnant women.ResultsThe analysis identified components that contributed to higher VCR in pregnant women across three different healthcare systems in Spain, UK, and US. The combination of several key interventions in each country led to a rapid increase in VCR that reached near-optimal levels (i.e. 75% for seasonal influenza) within a few years. As well as inclusion in national immunisation programme and vaccine reimbursement, key components that were identified included the mobilisation of health authorities, prenatal care Healthcare Professionals (HCP) and scientific societies, the inclusion of vaccination in antenatal medical guidance, the provision of educational material to HCPs, and a strong disease awareness driven by recent pertussis outbreaks in each country.ConclusionsAlthough there is no simple, universal solution to improving sub-optimal VCRs, the list of components identified in this study from three countries with high-performing Tdap and seasonal influenza vaccination programmes provides a basis for public health and medical stakeholders in other countries to define strategies to successfully implement national vaccination programmes for pregnant women. Peer Review reports BackgroundVaccination against seasonal influenza and pertussis in pregnancy has proven effective in reducing the burden of seasonal influenza among pregnant women and their infants as well as reducing the severity of pertussis in young infants [1,2,3,4]. Pregnant women and children particularly those less than 6 months of age are considered to be priority risk groups for influenza since they experience increased rates of outpatient visits, hospitalizations, and deaths [5, 6]. However, influenza vaccination is only recommended from 6 months of age and therefore cannot provide protection to the youngest, most vulnerable infants. Even though the evidence on the burden of pertussis in vulnerable adults is growing, severe pertussis infection mostly affects infants between birth and 6 months of age [7, 8]. Infants under 6 months of age accounted for 42.3% of all pertussis-related hospitalizations in 2018 among children in the United States (US) [9]. A modelling study by the World Health Organization (WHO) highlighted that there were 85,900 estimated pertussis-related deaths in infants younger than 1 year in 2014 worldwide [10]. With no pertussis vaccines licensed to protect new-borns in their first weeks of life, pertussis vaccination in pregnancy remains the most effective method of providing protection during this vulnerable period.In 2005, the WHO recommended influenza vaccination for all pregnant women. Due to the severity of 2009 H1N1 pandemic infections among pregnant women, this group was recommended as the highest priority group for inclusion in influenza immunisation programmes [11, 12]. This not only provides protection of the mother from severe disease but also protects the infant in the first months of life, before they are eligible to receive influenza vaccination. However, while influenza vaccination during pregnancy was gradually adopted in most high- and middle-income countries, many low-income countries have yet to include it in their routine immunisation programmes [13,14,15,16,17]. Furthermore, many existing programmes reach an influenza vaccine coverage rate (VCR) that is sub-optimal compared with the WHO target rate of 75% for the elderly and other risk groups [18,19,20,21]. In nine EU/EEA Member States, VCR ranged from 0.5 to 59% (median 25%) in 2016–17. The remaining EU/EEA Member States, where influenza vaccination is recommended for pregnant women, reported that vaccination coverage was not monitored for this population [22].In 2015, the WHO recommended pertussis vaccination in pregnancy as the most cost-effective additional strategy for preventing disease in infants too young to be vaccinated [23]. The routine use of combination pertussis, diphtheria, and tetanus vaccines (Tdap) means that maternal immunity is boosted against these infections in addition to the provision of passive neonatal protection. Currently, pertussis vaccination during pregnancy is recommended by the national or supranational health authorities in more than 55 countries globally [24, 25]. Yet, despite growing adoption and funding under national immunisation programmes, many countries consistently fail to achieve among pregnant women a VCR as high as in childhood vaccination programmes. Only a few high-income countries successfully vaccinate a majority of pregnant women, such as Spain, the United Kingdom (UK), or the US with respective VCRs of 84%, 71%, and 57% in 2019 [26,27,28,29].The WHO has developed several tools to support countries considering the introduction of pregnancy vaccination programmes or to improve the implementation of existing programmes. These include a toolkit for Influenza Vaccine Post-Introduction Evaluations and a dedicated field guide for the implementation of pregnancy vaccination in Latin America [30, 31]. However, actionable information for a successful programme of vaccination in pregnancy remains limited.This study aimed to provide a thorough analysis of the programmatic components that contribute to the success of influenza and Tdap vaccination programmes in pregnancy based on practices in high-income countries achieving high VCR.MethodsMethodological basisA range of methodologies were considered to analyse the performance of influenza and Tdap vaccination programmes in pregnancy. From WHO models on vaccine hesitancy to practical taxonomies for the determinants of vaccine uptake such as the 5As (Access, Affordability, Awareness, Acceptance, Activation), several methodologies have been developed to comprehend the outcome of vaccination programmes [32, 33]. Kassianos et al. study was selected as a methodological backbone for this study given its emphasis on identifying actionable programmatic and policy components contributing to high seasonal influenza VCR amongst high-income countries with adult vaccination programmes [34]. Based on an analysis of the vaccination programmes in the US, UK, Canada, and Australia, this methodological framework consists of five pillars structuring 42 components as contributing factors of high VCR among older adults, some of which are also relevant to vaccination in pregnancy. Since the factors contributing to vaccination in pregnancy may differ significantly from those among older adults, and since our study also includes Tdap vaccination, the five-pillar structure and list of components from Kassianos et al. was adapted and expanded based on data gathered in three relevant benchmark countries (Spain, UK, and US). A three-step data collection approach was thus used in the considered countries including a detailed review of published literature using an academic literature database, a manual search of official sources, and a complementary search of grey literature.Benchmark country selectionFor this analysis focusing on vaccination in pregnancy in high-income countries, Spain, the UK and the US were selected due to their pioneering approach to establishing both influenza and pertussis pregnancy vaccination programmes, their success in improving uptake, and the availability of annual VCR measurements by their respective health authorities to analyse the components that contributed to VCR growth. Even though other high-income countries than the three considered have developed pregnancy vaccination programmes they did not fulfil these three selection criteria and were thus not selected for this study. Furthermore, the US, with a mostly privatized and fragmented healthcare system, the UK with a public and centralized system, and Spain with a public and decentralized system were chosen as three illustrative examples to encompass different health system architectures. Since VCR values are published for England and Wales in separate reports, only England values are considered in this study to analyse trends given that the nation holds 84% of the UK population compared to 5% for Wales [35].Data collectionThe data collection relied both on global and country-specific published literature, and a manual search of official sources as well as grey literature available online (Table 1). An Embase search was performed to identify relevant published articles. Search terms were refined through Emtree subject headings searches and structured in three categories: Disease, Vaccination, and Population. Disease search terms in each category are detailed in Additional file 1 (Table SI 1). The search was performed for each country and publications from 2010 to 2020 were considered. All the titles and abstracts identified through these searches were screened using a patient, intervention, comparison, outcome (PICO) search strategy (Table SI 2), followed by a screening of the full text. As a result, 86 articles were selected for the US, 33 articles for the UK, and 23 articles for Spain (Table 1).Table 1 Sources of information utilized in the data collectionFull size tableAdditional manual searches of health authority (HA) websites and reports, leading scientific societies and research groups position papers, healthcare professional (HCP) associations training documentation, lay public communication material, and key conferences were conducted to limit potential publication bias in this study (Table 1). Such sources were also used to identify official VCR data and to evaluate the measures and actions implemented over time to improve VCR.Elaboration of the pregnancy VCR frameworkBased on the published literature, official documents and communication materials identified in the three countries considered, all components described as contributing to the performance of pregnancy vaccination programmes were listed. Since VCR is a multifactorial variable and as the impact of some components may take time to materialize, the components were not selected purely on the direct quantitative impact on VCR, but rather based on whether they were described as a key contributor of higher vaccine uptake among pregnant women. The framework was consequently adapted to vaccination in pregnancy by matching identified components with those of Kassianos et al. framework to either add, edit or replace them in the relevant pillars.ResultsThe implementation of the pregnancy vaccination programmes in Spain, the UK, and the US has led to coverage rates ranging from 44% to 61% for influenza and from 57 to 84% for Tdap (Figs. 1, 2, 3). In each country, VCR growth rate has generally been slower for seasonal influenza vaccination than for Tdap, despite earlier healthy authority recommendations and funding of vaccination costs [36]. For pertussis vaccination, the VCR improved to levels above 50% over a two-to-three year period in each country (Figs. 1, 2, 3).Fig. 1Evolution of VCR for influenza (2001–2019) and Tdap (2005–2019) among pregnant women in the US.

B Tetanus, diphtheria, acellular pertussis (Tdap)Full size imageThe United States – seasonal influenza vaccination in pregnancySeasonal influenza VCR data was collected from nationwide survey data published in several Mortality and Morbidity Weekly Reports (MMWR) articles and from Kennedy et al. [29, 37, 38]. The US pioneered influenza vaccination in pregnancy with a recommendation for at-risk pregnant women dating back to 1966, which was updated by the Advisory Committee on Immunisation Practices (ACIP) to all pregnant women in their third trimester in 1995, and expanded to the second trimester in 1997 [39,40,41]. By the early 2000s the VCR reached 10 to 20% (Fig. 1). In 2004, the recommendation was updated to include all trimesters in accordance with WHO guidance [11, 42, 43]. Despite an endorsement by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) in 2004, the VCR remained below 30% until 2007 [44]. The burden associated with the A/H1N1 2009 pandemic led to an increased mobilization among scientific societies, practitioners and lay public alike [45]. As a result, the VCR reached 50% by 2012 and over 60% in 2019. Nonetheless, current values fall short of the 80% target set by Healthy People 2020, an initiative that develops sets of objectives to improve the health of all Americans [46].The United States – pertussis (Tdap) vaccination in pregnancyTdap VCR was gathered from nationwide survey data from the CDC and MMWR articles [28, 29, 47]. A recommendation for the vaccination of at-risk pregnant women with Tdap was first issued in 2007 but the overall VCR remained close to 0% (Fig. 1). Following the 2010 pertussis outbreak in California, a recommendation was issued by the state to expand Tdap vaccination to both at-risk and healthy pregnant women [48]. This was followed by the ACIP which issued a recommendation in 2011 to vaccinate pregnant women with no prior history of Tdap vaccination, updated in 2012 to all pregnancies [49, 50]. This move was actively endorsed by scientific societies and key HCP associations such as the ACOG in 2013 [51]. Guidelines were cascaded to their members and the medical care organizations also followed suit by including Tdap vaccination in the medical protocol of pregnant women [52]. The impact on VCR was substantial, increasing from 9% to 50% within 2 years, and was also driven by the high public awareness at the time fed by communication from multiple stakeholders around pertussis prevention (Fig. 1). Since 2014 however the VCR measured by CDC surveys has plateaued at 55%, suggesting, as for influenza vaccination, persisting issues with regard to access to vaccination, HCP engagement and vaccine acceptance [29].The United Kingdom – seasonal influenza vaccination in pregnancyIn the UK, VCR data was collected from PHE (Public Health England) which extracts and aggregates data from General Practitioners (GPs) electronic reports [53]. PHE issued a recommendation for influenza vaccination during pregnancy in 2010, following a Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) decision, in response to the severity of the A/H1N1pdm09 strain among pregnant women [54, 55]. This decision was corroborated by the cost-effectiveness of the intervention [56, 57]. PHE and the NHS (National Health Service) updated their guidance, training kits, and awareness materials accordingly to support GPs. As a result, VCR quickly reached 27% in the first season, 2011/2012, and 40% in the 2012/2013 seasons (Fig. 2). However, the limited vaccine effectiveness and persisting myths around the risks of vaccination have contributed to a plateau of the VCR at sub-optimal levels around 45% since the 2014/15 season, markedly below the WHO and EU target of 75% (Fig. 2).The United Kingdom – pertussis (Tdap) vaccination in pregnancyFor Tdap pregnancy vaccination, the VCR increase occurred faster due to high disease awareness among healthcare professionals and lay public alike. The national pertussis outbreak in 2012 caused the deaths of 14 non-immunized infants [58]. In a context of intense media noise on the large increase in cases and deaths reported by the Health Protection Agency (HPA), the JCVI adopted the recommendation for Tdap vaccination during all pregnancies [59,60,61,62]. A rapid roll-out of the guidance, training resources and awareness material for GPs led by PHE and the NHS followed, leading to a VCR above 50% in the first year [63] (Fig. 2). As this programme was proven to be safe, highly efficient, and cost-effective, it was extended for a further 5 years in 2014 [64]. The recommendation of the vaccination timing was expanded in 2016 to include weeks 16–32 of pregnancy and obstetricians, gynecologists, and midwives were increasingly mobilized in addition to the GPs. The programme was eventually adopted as routine in 2019 with VCR having reached a plateau around 70% [63, 65]. (Fig. 2).Spain – seasonal influenza vaccination in pregnancyHealth authorities in Spain included pregnant women in their second or third trimester in the risk groups for influenza vaccination as early as 2005 [66]. This was rapidly extended to all trimesters starting in 2006 in regions such as Catalonia [67, 68]. Yet, influenza VCR remained consistently low among pregnant women, at ~ 5%, as highlighted in several regional studies [67, 69] (Fig. 3). The roll-out of the Tdap pregnancy vaccination programme had a positive impact on influenza vaccination of pregnant women and synergies between the programmes led to a significant increase in influenza VCR, ultimately reaching the national VCR target of 40% for pregnant women in the 2018/2019 season [69,70,71,72] (Fig. 3). VCR data aggregated from regional reporting by the Ministry of Health since 2017/18 has shown a sharp increase [70, 73].Spain – pertussis (Tdap) vaccination in pregnancyThe rapid adoption of Tdap vaccination during pregnancy was driven by a public health response to the rising number of pertussis cases and deaths in infants below 3 months of age due to a “permanent outbreak situation” from 2011 to 2015 [74]. In light of the recommendation from the JCVI in 2012 in the UK, scientific societies including the Spanish Association of Paediatrics (AEP) played an important role in highlighting the burden of pertussis to national and regional health authorities [75, 76]. This led to the adoption of new recommendations by three pioneering regions (Catalonia, Asturias, and Navarra). By the end of 2016, all regions had introduced a Tdap pregnancy vaccination program. An analysis rapidly confirmed the effectiveness of the approach with the Red Nacional de Vigilancia Epidemiológica (RENAVE) highlighting a decreased incidence of pertussis cases in infants under 1 year of age and especially those under 3 months of age [74]. Since 2016, Tdap VCR data aggregated from regional reporting available from the Ministry of Health has been consistently at or above 80% since 2016 [70] (Fig. 3).The five-pillar VCR framework and adaptation of the list of componentsAs part of this analysis, a set of key components driving vaccine uptake was identified. The pre-existing five-pillar framework for influenza VCR was utilised to organise a list of components tailored to the specificities of seasonal influenza and Tdap vaccination in pregnancy [34]. The 5-pillar structure was confirmed as applicable and the pillars were adapted as follows: 1. Health Authority accountability and strengths of the pregnancy vaccination programme. 2. Facilitated patient access to vaccination. 3. Healthcare professional accountability and engagement. 4. Awareness of the burden and severity of diseases. 5. Belief in the benefits of pregnancy vaccination. A total of 45 components were identified as relevant contributing factors to the successful roll-out of a pregnancy vaccination programme (Table 2). Of these, 15 components were unchanged from the previous framework, 14 were adapted, 16 were added as specific to the context of vaccination in pregnancy, and 13 removed as not applicable [34]. The national health authority recommendation, the absence of financial barriers to getting immunized, and a structured infectious disease surveillance network are applicable to maternal immunisation programme and were amongst the components that remained unchanged. The components that were adjusted to the context of vaccination in pregnancy include but are not limited to multiple HCPs (Ob-Gyns, GPs, midwives, nurses, pharmacists) being allowed to vaccinate, training of HCPs on pregnancy vaccination by multiple stakeholders, and adapted HCP training material for pregnancy vaccination. The new components specifically identified for the vaccination of pregnant women include the mention of immunization in the pregnant women medical protocol, a clear delineation of HCP roles and responsibilities, and the availability of adapted awareness material at maternal care providers.Table 2 List of components among the five pillars contributing to high influenza and Tdap VCR among pregnant womenFull size tableResults of the five-pillar assessment across the three countriesThe adjusted five-pillar VCR framework of 45 components was used as a methodological basis to analyse the factors that contributed to the successful programmes in the US, the UK and Spain. There was significant variability across the three countries, which is likely to be attributable to the structural differences in the healthcare architecture and strategy applied for the commissioning of the vaccination programme in pregnancy. Overall, the UK had the highest number of components fully implemented (38 out of 45), followed by Spain (31 out of 45), and the US (25 out of 45). In the UK, five components were deemed as partially implemented, compared with 11 in Spain and 18 in the US. Finally, two components were missing in both the UK and the US, and three in Spain (Fig. 4). These differences mainly concerned components relating to the role of VCR targets and monitoring, the convenience of the patient journey, and the importance of the different HCPs involved in recommending and delivering vaccination in pregnancy. The three countries also differed in how adequate training was provided to HCPs as well as the incentivization for vaccinating pregnant women. (Additional file 1, Figs. SI 1–3) Finally, while the framework applied to both influenza and pertussis, some nuances between the two must be considered. The VCR of pertussis vaccination in pregnancy was higher than for influenza in all three countries, possibly because this programme emphasizes the indirect protection of the infant from the potentially serious complications of pertussis in infancy. Although there are benefits of influenza vaccination in pregnancy for infants, these may be less well-known or communicated to pregnant women. Finally, the seasonal nature of influenza vaccination has practical implications which must be considered for both the timing of vaccine administration and the identification of pregnant women.Fig. 4Pregnancy VCR gap analysis for the US, the UK and SpainFull size imageDiscussionThe Pregnancy VCR framework developed in this study is designed to facilitate the implementation of vaccination programmes for pregnant women by providing a list of possible components structured in five pillars. The onus would remain with an individual country to determine the applicability and relevance of a specific intervention. The significant variability of the results indicates that having a successful programme does not rely on having all components but rather finding the right combinations of components that are tailored to each country’s context and healthcare system architecture.The US, the UK, and more recently Spain, have monitored VCR following the introduction of their pregnancy vaccination programmes, enabling the analysis of the evolution of vaccine uptake and the components associated with VCR growth. The vaccination programmes analysed owe a large part of their success to proactive health authorities (Pillar 1). Beyond establishing an official vaccination recommendation and reimbursement, supporting programme implementation is critical. In the UK, PHE and the NHS were instrumental in producing HCP training material and information for patients when commissioning the immunisation programme [78]. In Spain, the proactive development of such communication materials by some regional health authorities is likely to have contributed to the higher performance of some regions such as Cantabria and Comunitat Valenciana, both achieving Tdap VCR above 90% among pregnant women [26, 66]. In the US, given the higher diversity of stakeholders, a multi-stakeholder approach with frequent and coordinated calls to action from the CDC and the leading scientific societies were essential to ensure the continued uptake of pregnancy vaccinations. For instance, the 2020 maternal task force reinforced the importance of a one-voice message from key HCP associations involved in the care of pregnant women [79, 80]. Another key lever that health authorities can act upon is to include pregnancy vaccination as part of the routine antenatal medical protocol [81]. Furthermore, continuous and accurate monitoring of VCR is a key element for the evaluation of a programme after its introduction and can be complemented by setting official VCR targets.Facilitated access to vaccination (Pillar 2) with minimum physical, geographic, and financial barriers stands out as critical. Beyond offering vaccination free of charge, providing pregnant women with the opportunity to be vaccinated in convenient settings including GP clinics, community antenatal clinics, hospitals, or pharmacies, and authorising multiple HCP roles to vaccinate pregnant women was key. In the US, access to influenza vaccination is generally convenient, and pregnant women are often immunised by obstetricians, gynecologists, or pharmacists [28]. In the UK and Spain, midwives accompany women throughout their pregnancy and therefore play a decisive role in driving awareness of the recommendations for vaccination [72, 82, 83]. A study in the Greater Manchester area in the UK highlighted the beneficial impact of coordinating GP surgeries with antenatal services, pharmacists, NHS foundation teams, and primary care trusts to maximize uptake among pregnant women. An effective electronic vaccine record and the allocation of adequate training resources to align messages across HCPs were found to be important components [84]. Initiatives such as text4baby in the US have also proved to be efficient calls to action to prompt pregnant women to get vaccinated [85, 86].Regarding the accountability and engagement of HCPs (Pillar 3), a strong recommendation from an HCP is a clear driver of vaccine uptake for pregnant women as shown in multiple surveys from the US CDC [28, 38]. The mobilization of antenatal care professionals, such as obstetricians, gynecologists, and midwives is essential, given the importance of their advice for pregnant women and the multiple medical touchpoints during pregnancy. As such, in the US, the active endorsement of the ACIP recommendation by multiple HCP societies was crucial for the adoption of Tdap pregnancy vaccination [51]. Additionally, specific training and toolkits are produced and disseminated by the CDC and the ACOG to encourage obstetricians and gynecologists to vaccinate pregnant women [87,88,89]. In the UK, influenza and Tdap pregnancy vaccination is fully part of the contractual agreement between the health authorities and GPs, and includes the financial incentivization of vaccination in pregnancy (£10.06 per immunisation in 2019) as compensation for the obligation to record immunisation status, call and recall eligible individuals, and document active refusals [90].Finally, awareness of the disease burden and belief in vaccination benefits are paramount to a successful programme (Pillars 4 and 5). The awareness of the burden of the disease relies on a well-established infectious disease surveillance network, whose epidemiological and clinical data can be used for research, public health decision making, and communication purposes [82]. The knowledge of the disease severity and vulnerability to the infection have an immediate effect on VCR as illustrated by the impact of the pertussis outbreaks in the UK and Spain at the inception of their respective programmes [59, 75, 76]. In the US, patient associations such as the California Immunisation Coalition have developed collections of stories to illustrate the burden of vaccine-preventable diseases such as pertussis. Confidence in vaccine safety and vaccine effectiveness can nonetheless vary widely, especially for vaccination in pregnancy, depending on cultural, ethnic, and socioeconomic factors [77]. An active monitoring and responsiveness towards vaccine disinformation complemented by regular attitudinal surveys of the perceptions of both pregnant women and the HCPs who take care of them are essential to address misconceptions and tailor communication strategies [91,92,93,94].While the benefits of pregnancy vaccination programmes are acknowledged by the public health community, increasing VCR remains a complex challenge which can often present an added level of difficulty for the vaccination of pregnant women given the persisting misconceptions on the safety of such interventions [36, 52, 95]. A large number of studies have gathered quantitative insights on the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of pregnant women and HCPs with the aim to suggest avenues for improvement [36, 69, 92, 96, 97]. However, few studies have isolated programmatic and policy directed interventions at the initiation of programmes that lead to high pregnancy vaccination uptakes for influenza or for Tdap [14, 98]. No previous studies have documented the experience of successful pregnancy vaccination programmes for influenza and pertussis across countries with different healthcare systems.As such, this is the first study to describe the components of a successful pregnancy programme for both influenza and Tdap vaccinations across all the different stakeholders involved. These components are clustered in 5 pillars, providing a ready-to-use framework to complement the field guide developed by the WHO for Latin America and the WHO manual on the implementation of influenza vaccination of pregnant women [30, 99].This analysis also provides a comprehensive framework to perform a situation assessment and identify policy and programmatic gaps hindering high VCR in pregnancy. Given the increasing number of countries issuing recommendations for vaccinating pregnant women, and the room for improvement in several existing programmes, including the three countries covered in this study, this analysis of best-in-class practices highlights key drivers for uptake. In the current context of the COVID-19 pandemic, some of the key learnings from this study could also be useful for scientific discussions and policy-making regarding COVID-19 VCR in pregnant women [77].This study has several limitations. Firstly, the selection of the studied countries could have been widened to include other countries with well-established pregnancy vaccination programmes. For instance, surveys have been performed in Canada and Australia with the objective of identifying challenges regarding vaccination during pregnancy and strategies to overcome these issues [100, 101]. Moreover, the three countries are examined from national perspective that does not take into account nuances and disparities across their regions or states. VCR estimation methods also vary from country to country with CDC data based on surveys for the US, while PHE data is based on GP reports, and Spanish data from reporting in each region. Furthermore, the adaptability of the framework to low- or middle-income countries is limited since only high-income countries were selected for this analysis. High-performing pregnancy vaccination programmes also exist in upper middle income countries such as Argentina and Mexico [102,103,104].ConclusionsThis study has shown that the components of successful pregnancy vaccination programmes can be analysed through five key pillars for success. Within each of these pillars a list of components that combine to drive vaccine uptake was identified, with the US, the UK and Spain each having their own specific combination of components contributing to high VCRs among pregnant women. The three studied countries show that a successful VCR does not necessarily require the implementation of all components; instead, the combination of components should be fine-tuned according to the specificities of the healthcare system in place and in consideration of the societal and cultural aspects of pregnancy vaccination. This framework can therefore serve as a guiding tool for public health experts, health authorities, and HCPs to identify the most relevant components for the successful implementation of a pregnancy vaccination programme that can be adapted to the local context.

We conducted a nationwide study of children aged 6 months to 15 years with idiopathic NS to assess the relationship between NS relapse, flu vaccination, and flu infections. We used a multivariate Poisson regression model (MPRM) to calculate the risk ratio (RR) for flu infection and for NS relapse in children with and without flu vaccination. Data of 306 children were assessed. The MPRM in all 306 children showed a significantly lower RR for flu infection (RR: 0.21, 95% confidence interval CI 0.11–0.38) and for NS relapse (RR: 0.22, 95% CI 0.14–0.35) in children receiving flu vaccination compared with unvaccinated children. In an additional MPRM only among 102 children receiving flu vaccination, they had a significantly lower risk for NS relapse during the post-vaccination period (RR: 0.31. 95% CI 017–0.56) compared with the pre-vaccination period. Although our study was observational, based on the favorable results of flu vaccinations regarding flu infections and NS relapse, the vaccine may be recommended for children with NS.

The incidence of idiopathic NS is approximately 1 in 16 per 100,000 children1, over half of whom develop frequently relapsing NS (FRNS) or steroid-dependent NS (SDNS)2. To prevent NS relapse, these patients require prolonged steroid therapy and immunosuppressive agents3,4. These children have been the state of immunocompromised, in which they have the potential for recurrent or severe infections.Children with chronic renal disease have a higher risk for severe influenza (flu) infections than healthy children5,6,7. Administering flu vaccines is effective in reducing the prevalence of flu infections and the risk of severe flu infection. Kidney disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines suggest that children with NS should receive flu vaccination to reduce the risk of serious infections8. Pediatric patients with NS can be protected against flu infection using an inactivated influenza vaccine, even if they are being treated with glucocorticoids or other immunosuppressive drugs5. However, as an immunogenic stimulus, immunizations have been reported to trigger NS relapse in children9,10,11,12,13,14. Although inactivated flu vaccines could precipitate NS relapse15,16, available data regarding the relative risk of NS relapse related to flu vaccines have been scarce until recently. We previously evaluated NS relapse after 104 children with NS received an inactivated subunit-antigen influenza virus vaccine17. Compared with the NS relapse rate during the pre-vaccination period as a control, the rate within 1 month after receiving flu vaccination was slightly but non-significantly increased (1.19 vs. 1.23 times/person-year, risk ratio: 1.04, 95% confidence interval: 0.82–1.89, p=0.88). Limitations of our previous research included that it was a retrospective study in a single tertiary center and included no data of flu infections. Further studies using a larger sample at multiple centers were needed to investigate not only NS relapses but also flu infections after influenza vaccination.Here, we report the findings of a nationwide cohort study among Japanese children with idiopathic NS in which we focus on the relationships among NS relapses, flu vaccines, and flu infections.ResultsParticipant characteristicsOverall, 105 of 388 institutions responded to the third questionnaire, and we collected data for 306 children. Figure 1 shows a flow chart of the study design and study populations.Figure 1Flow chart of study design and populations. Of 388 institutions, 105 responded to the third questionnaire and data were collected for 306 children.Full size imageWe divided the children into two groups; those who received flu vaccination and those who did not receive flu vaccination. These children's clinical characteristics according to both the second and third questionnaires are shown in Table 1.Table 1 Clinical characteristics of the patients.Full size tableFlu infectionTable 2 shows that 65 children (21.2%) developed flu infection between 1 May 2015 and 31 April 2016. Compared with children who received flu vaccination, the flu infection rate among children without flu vaccination was significantly higher (12.7 vs. 25.4%, p = 0.01) . The diagnostic method of flu infections and the influenza strain were evaluated in 62 children (68 flu infection cases). All 13 infected children who received flu vaccination and 54 of 55 infected children who did not receive flu vaccination were diagnosed using rapid antigen detection tests and nasopharyngeal swab samples; 6 vaccinated and 25 unvaccinated children had influenza A infection, and 7 vaccinated and 29 unvaccinated children had influenza B infection. Only one unvaccinated patient was clinically diagnosed with flu infection. Figure 2 shows that the seasonal distribution of flu infections during the 2015/16 season was from January to May, and the highest number of flu infections was in February.Table 2 Flu infections and nephrotic syndrome relapses.Full size tableFigure 2Number of influenza virus infections.

(a) all influenza infections, (b) influenzaA infections, (c) influenzaB infections.Full size tableThe multivariate Poisson regression model (MPRM) showed statistical evidence of a higher risk ratio for all flu infections in February than in other months (risk ratio: 16.58. 95% confidence interval: 10.23–26.89), and a lower risk ratio for flu infections in children with older age at the onset of NS (risk ratio: 0.90. 95% confidence interval: 0.84–0.97) and in children who received flu vaccination (risk ratio: 0.21. 95% confidence interval: 0.11–0.38) (Table 3a). According to flu antigen, the data of risk ratio for influenza B infection were similar to those for all influenza strains (Table 3c); however, the age at onset of NS was not significantly related to influenza A infection (Table 3b). Flu infection in children with NS was not significantly related to sex or history of steroid-resistant NS (SRNS).NS relapseIn total, 100 children (32.7%) had NS relapse between 1 May 2015 and 31 April 2016, and there were 190 total NS relapses (Table 2). The proportion of children with NS relapse was slightly higher in children who were not vaccinated compared with their vaccinated counterparts; however, this did not reach statistical significance. Furthermore, the number of NS relapses among children without the flu vaccination was significantly higher compared with children who received the flu vaccination (0.25 vs 0.74 times/person-year, p < 0.0001). There was no seasonal distribution of NS relapse (Fig. 3).Figure 3Number of nephrotic syndrome (NS) relapses. There was no seasonal distribution of NS relapse.Full size imageResults of multivariate analysis to evaluate the risk ratio for NS relapseIn Table 4, the MPRM for 306 children that received and did not receive flu vaccination showed a significantly lower risk ratio for NS relapse in children who received flu vaccination (risk ratio: 0.22. 95% confidence interval: 0.14–0.35), and a higher risk ratio for NS relapse in children with a history of FRNS or SDNS or SRNS (risk ratio: 2.80. 95% confidence interval: 1.90–4.11). Sex and age at onset of NS were not independent risk factors for NS relapse in this multivariate analysis.Table 4 Risk ratio for nephrotic syndrome relapse in 306 children who received and did not receive flu vaccination (multivariate analysis).Full size tableTable 5 shows the results of the MPRM conducted among the 102 children who received flu vaccination to evaluate the risk of NS relapse during the period after flu vaccination in comparison with before flu vaccination. Taking glucocorticoids at the time of flu vaccination was a risk factor significantly associated with NS relapse (risk ratio: 3.17. 95% confidence interval: 1.74–5.80). Compared with the pre-vaccination period, a significantly lower risk for NS relapse during the post-vaccination period (risk ratio: 0.31. 95% confidence interval: 017–0.56). There was no significant relationship between NS relapse and sex or being on cyclosporine or mizoribine at the time of flu vaccination.Table 5 Risk ratio for nephrotic syndrome relapse among 102 children who received flu vaccination (multivariate analysis).Full size tableDiscussionIn the present study, we conducted a nationwide cohort study comprising 306 children with idiopathic NS, and showed that children who received flu vaccination had significantly fewer flu infections and NS relapses than those who did not receive flu vaccination. Additionally, the former group showed a significantly lower NS relapse risk during the post-vaccination period compared with the pre-vaccination period.In this cohort, we examined the relationship among flu vaccination, flu infections, and NS relapses. Multivariate analysis revealed a significantly lower risk ratio for NS relapse in children who received flu vaccination. It has long been considered that vaccination itself can precipitate NS relapse as an immunogenic stimulation; however, the in-depth mechanism of immunogenic pathogenesis has not been elucidated. Several clinical studies have clinically suggested that the varicella vaccine10,11, meningococcal C conjugate vaccine12, and hepatitis B virus vaccine13 trigger NS relapses in children with NS. Nevertheless, that vaccination can precipitate NS relapse is not applicable to all vaccines. The 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine has not been found to be related to the risk of NS relapse in association with vaccination14. Focusing on flu vaccination in patients with NS, Fernandes et al. described a case report of NS relapse following the use of a monovalent whole-virion inactivated flu vaccine15. However, in our nationwide analysis investigating both vaccinated and unvaccinated patients at a number of institutions, we revealed a significant decrease in the NS relapse risk among children who received flu vaccination. Our results provide affirmative findings in comparison with our previous study targeting 104 vaccinated children with NS in a single facility. According to our past and present studies, it may be unnecessary to avoid flu vaccination in children with NS for fear of NS relapse.In children with NS, an immunogenic stimulus related to infection or vaccination might trigger an NS relapse caused by the activation of T cells in an acute process12,18. However, no studies have reported that infections or vaccinations were associated with a decreased rate of NS relapse immunologically. We expect that the prevention of flu infection in NS children who received the flu vaccine might lead to a decrease in the rate of NS relapse regarding flu infection. Moreover, because flu vaccinations preventive flu infection as well as other infectious diseases19,20, flu vaccinations might also prevent NS relapse triggered by other infections.This cohort study provided statistical evidence of a lower risk ratio for flu infection among children who receive flu vaccination. It has been reported that upper respiratory viral infections in pediatric patients induce NS relapse. McDonald et al. showed that respiratory viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, varicella zoster virus, and adenovirus are associated with NS exacerbation and relapse in children21. Similarly, NS relapse following influenza virus infection has been reported, including infection with the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus18,21. Therefore, reducing flu infections in children with NS is desirable. The effectiveness of flu vaccination in pediatric patients with NS is proven serologically, with adequate antibody responses at 6 months post-vaccination16. In addition, our survey demonstrated the clinical efficacy of flu vaccination among children with NS in preventing flu infections.We found that being on glucocorticoids when receiving flu vaccination was a risk factor significantly associated with NS relapse among children with NS. Pediatric patients treated with steroids at the time of flu vaccination would means on the state soon after the last NS relapse. Thus, NS relapses might be easy to trigger in children who are treated with steroids at the time of receiving flu vaccination owing to taking glucocorticoids being a marker of recent NS relapse.The present study had several limitations. First, a significant difference in the history of FRNS between children with and without flu vaccination was a confounding factor. We could not adjust the data to control for this, even when making adjustments in the multivariate analysis, because this was an uncontrolled study. Each physician may have used the type of NS as a selection criterion when deciding to recommend flu vaccination to patients. Regardless, we evaluated many influencing factors for flu infection and NS relapse to adjust for confounding factors as much as possible. Nevertheless, we should recognize this confounding factor in the present analysis and therefore, the results regarding a lower risk for NS relapse in children who received the flu vaccination cannot be applied to all children with NS. We should interpret these confounding factors carefully, with the understanding that differences in their background often occur in this type of survey. Although a randomized trial might resolve these confounding factors, the methodology of the present study is easier to perform when establishing the side effects of vaccinations as a primary endpoint, as well as accumulating the required number of patients to detect differences. Moreover, we expect that there are other unrecognized confounding factors between children with and without flu vaccination. Second, we could not collect data of all events during the observation period. With further details, including data of whether fever, rhinorrhea, coughing, and vomiting resulting from both bacterial and viral infections triggered NS relapse, we might be able to conclude that flu vaccination could prevent NS relapse in terms of direct management of various infections. Third, we had no data regarding the precise interval between the timing of flu vaccination and NS relapses in each individual. Because the side effects of the inactivated subunit-antigen flu vaccine generally occur within 2–4 weeks of administration, NS relapses within 1 month after vaccination were possibly triggered by vaccination itself. However, differences in the state of NS activity during the pre- and post-vaccination periods are worth evaluating to determine whether there is a significantly lower risk for NS relapse in the post-vaccination period as compared with the pre-vaccination period. Fourth, flu infection was determined using only rapid antigen detection tests. This type of test is notoriously inaccurate, with a low sensitivity (approximately 60%) but high specificity (> 95%)22. However, Keitel et al. reported the sensitivity of rapid antigen detection tests increased to 92% when performed between 24 and 48 h after the onset of symptoms23. This study was conducted in Japan where it is common to perform rapid antigen detection tests between 24 and 48 h after the onset of symptoms. Although we should consider this bias of inaccuracy in our study, the concordance rate in our patients was not as inaccurate as those in the article by Chartland. Finally, vaccine policies in each center are not uniform. Some facilities have a policy of administering inactivated subunit-antigen flu vaccines to children with NS depending on their steroid dose, and other centers have different policies depending on the period from onset of NS or last NS relapse.In conclusion, although our study was observational, based on the favorable results of flu vaccination against flu infection and NS relapse, the vaccine may be recommended for children with NS regardless of immunosuppressant use at the time of vaccination.MethodsStudy design and populationsThe Japanese Pediatric Survey Holding Information of Nephrotic Syndrome (JP-SHINE) study, a nationwide cohort study, was established by the Japanese Study Group of Renal Disease in Children. The first survey was sent on 4 April 2014 to 1860 institutions throughout Japan, including all universities and children’s and general hospitals with more than 20 beds. Patients were eligible if they were newly diagnosed with idiopathic NS between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2012, were between 6 months and 15 years old, and if they had been treated for up to 3 years during this time. Patients with congenital nephrotic syndrome or nephrotic syndrome secondary to nephritis were excluded. The first questionnaire, which was designed to record the number of children with idiopathic NS at each institution and their basic information, was sent to 1860 institutions. Of these, 1050 institutions (56.5%) responded to the first questionnaire24. We sent both questionnaires to 388 institutions that consented to cooperate with our study and which were eligible for a second and third questionnaire. The second questionnaire for patients who fulfilled the eligibility criteria was sent to 388 institutions and recorded information including patients’ basic characteristics, renal biopsy, idiopathic NS complications, steroid therapy side effects, and prognosis. We collected data for 999 patients25. In the third questionnaire, we recorded the age when the patient received the first inactivated subunit-antigen flu vaccine, the total number of flu vaccinations received, total number of flu infections, total number of NS relapses, rituximab (RTX) use at the first flu vaccination, and immunosuppressant use at the first flu vaccination (cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, mizoribine, cyclophosphamide, tacrolimus) between 1 May 2015 and 31 April 2016.DefinitionsIn the present study, the definitions of general conditions in pediatric NS were according to clinical guidelines issued by the Japanese Society for Pediatric Nephrology26,27. Idiopathic NS in children was defined as hypoalbuminemia (serum albumin levels ≤ 2.5 g/dL) and severe proteinuria (≥ 40 mg/h/m2 in pooled nighttime urine or an early morning urine protein creatinine (Cr) ratio > 2.0 g/g Cr). Complete remission was defined as a urine protein creatinine ratio < 0.2 g/g Cr or ≤ negative protein on early morning urine dipstick testing for 3 consecutive days. SSNS was defined as complete remission in < 4 weeks after starting daily prednisolone therapy. NS relapse was defined as ≥ 3 + protein on early morning urine dipstick testing for 3 consecutive days. FRNS was defined as two or more relapses within 6 months after initial response or four or more relapses within any consecutive 12-month period. SDNS was defined as two consecutive relapses occurring during steroid therapy or within 2 weeks of treatment cessation. SRNS was defined as the absence of complete remission after a 4-week course of oral prednisolone 60 mg/m2/day. RTX therapy duration was defined as the period from the day of rituximab administration to the day of B-cell recovery (CD19 + B-cell count ≥ 1% of total lymphocytes).Influenza virus infection was diagnosed using rapid antigen detection tests with a nasopharyngeal swab sample or was clinically diagnosed by an attending pediatrician. In Japan, children younger than 13 years old generally receive flu vaccination twice per year and those over 13 years old are vaccinated once per year. In children who received two vaccinations in the same year, we defined the “first flu vaccine” as their first vaccination of the two. Antigen strains in inactivated flu vaccines between 2015 and 2016 were A/California/7/2009 (X-179A) (H1N1) pdm09, A/Switzerland/9,715,293/2013 NIB-88 (H3N2), B/Phuket/3073/2013, and B/Texas/2/2013.Steroid therapy and immunosuppressantsWe adopted the modified International Study of Kidney Diseases in Children protocol, as shown in the Japanese pediatric idiopathic NS guideline3,27,28,29, and 63% of children were treated with the protocol, as follows. The initial 8-week treatment protocol was 60 mg/m2/day prednisolone (maximum daily dosage 60 mg) for 4 weeks, followed by 40 mg/m2/day (maximum daily dosage 40 mg) on alternate days for 4 weeks25.Thirty percent of children were treated with the prolonged protocol, which was initial treatment using a prolonged protocol of 60 mg/m2/day prednisolone (maximum daily dosage 60 mg) for 4 weeks, followed by 40 mg/m2/day (maximum daily dosage 40 mg) on alternate days, tapered over 2–6 months. Treatment in the remaining 7% of children was unknown. Immunosuppressants used between 1 May 2015 and 31 April 2016 were cyclosporine in 55%, mizoribine in 39%, cyclophosphamide in 13%, mycophenolate mofetil in 11%, RTX in 11%, and tacrolimus in 2% of patients.EthicsThis study was conducted according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and following the ethical guidelines for Medical and Health Research Involving Human Subjects of the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare in Japan. Yokohama City University Hospital's central ethics review board approved this study (approval number: 1509001). This ethics committee clearly stated that the researchers did not need to obtain informed consent, because complete data in this study were collected from patient medical records. In accordance with this statement, informed consent was not required from patients or their parents in this study. According to the guidelines and the institutional ethics review board for the patients’ benefit, the protocol was displayed publicly in a poster at each hospital, and each patient or their family had the opportunity to refuse to be included in this analysis.Statistical analysisThe calculated sample size was 200–300 children (100–150 per group). We set the ratio of the group those who received flu vaccination and those who did not receive flu vaccination as 1:1. We needed approximately 30 events (children with flu infection) in our analysis, because we assumed that the number of events was greater than 10–15 in the groups that did and did not receive the flu vaccination. The number of children aged under 15 years in Japan is 1,500 million. The estimated number of pediatric outpatients aged under 15 years was assumed to be 500 million cumulatively, based on pediatric sentinel sites. If the rate of flu infection diagnosis is assumed to be 40%, the estimated number of children diagnosed with flu infection is 200 million (13.3%: 200 million divided by 1,500 million). As a result, the sample size was set as 225 children (13.3%: 30 divided by 225 children), which was calculated to satisfy these assumptions. We used t-tests for continuous values and the chi-square and Fisher’s exact test for categorical values. All data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation or number (percentage). We used a MPRM for children who received or did not receive flu vaccination to calculate the risk ratio for flu infection, adjusted for receiving or not receiving flu vaccination, sex, age at NS onset, history of FRNS or SDNS or SRNS, flu infection in February or another month, and the risk ratio for NS relapse adjusted for whether the patients received flu vaccination, sex, age at NS onset, and history of FRNS or SDNS or SRNS. The classification of renal biopsy and history of NS type were correlated and not independent (for example, children with focal segmental glomerular sclerosis were likely to have FRNS/SDNS/SRNS). For this reason and because there was a significant difference in history of FRNS between the two groups, we chose history of NS types (the reason for unifying the three types of NS was that they were not independent of each other and could overlap in one patient).To evaluate the risk of NS relapse after flu vaccination, we used the MPRM only among children who received flu vaccination to calculate the risk ratio for NS relapse, adjusted for the post-vaccination period or pre-vaccination period, sex, and whether the patient was taking glucocorticoids or various immunosuppressants at flu vaccination. Taking medication at the time of vaccination is an important factor for vaccine studies. Moreover, history of NS was not added because this type correlated with medicine use at vaccination (cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, rituximab, and tacrolimus were excluded because the rate of children using these medicines was low, making it difficult to estimate statistically). A P-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. We used SAS software package for Windows, release 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc. Cary, NC, USA) to perform all statistical analyses.

Nearly Two Years into this Pandemic, Where Are We and What's in the Future? Share: Type: NewsAs we grind on toward the two-year anniversary of this pandemic and assess where we are, the question on everyone's mind is, What's ahead? With profound regret and sadness, we acknowledge the 5 million deaths worldwide and the nearly 750,000 Americans who have perished from COVID19. That's an astonishing death toll, promising to rival that of the 1918 influenza pandemic. We are not yet done. More outbreaks will occur, and more people will die, primarily among the unvaccinated. The Good, Bad, and Ugly I divide our current situation into good things, bad things, things we got right, and things we got wrong. The most obvious good things were the messenger RNA vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna. While to some they seemed to arise in a hurry, in point of fact they were decades in the making, drawing on the basic research of Kati Karik, Drew Weissman, and Barney Graham. These vaccines have saved an incalculable number of lives and have given us hope for a return to a less frightening way of life. The basic mRNA technology will open up vaccines and cures for other infectious and chronic diseases far into the future. Other serendipitous good things include the virtual absence of influenza deaths during the pandemic. Usually more than a hundred children die of influenza during an influenza season. During the 2020-2021 season, only one child in the United States died of influenza. Whether influenza will come roaring back as we drop COVID mitigation strategies depends in part on our behavior and in part on the vagaries of the influenza virus itself. Get your flu shot. Timeline Vaccination caption: Timeline of daily COVID-19 vaccine doses administered in the United States as of October 19, 2021. (Our World In Data, CC BY 4.0 <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0>, via Wikimedia Commons) The bad things, regrettably, are numerous: the unnecessary deaths among the unvaccinated, insufficient and inadequate personal protective equipment for healthcare workers, the polarization of our society and the politicization of vaccines and masks, the deep pandemic fatigue all are experiencing, the exhausted and discouraged healthcare workers, the overwhelmed healthcare system, and the yet-to-be- reckoned-with enormous healthcare burden of long-haul COVID, which will haunt us for many decades into the future. The saddest of all of these is the perversion of sound public health measures into oppositional political tribalism and the loss of any concern for the common good. The virus doesn't care what your political party is or what liberties you hold dear. It is only looking for a susceptible respiratory tract in which to replicate. We seem to have lost all compassion for our fellow man, woman, or child. Unvaccinated people are a risk to themselves and to others. Get fully vaccinated if you haven't done so already. If you are fully vaccinated, thank you for looking after yourself and your neighbors. The most important things we got right were the successful mitigation strategies that slowed the virus before vaccine deployment and on which we continue to rely today. These include mask wearing, especially in indoor spaces, staying close to home, avoiding crowds, and focusing on outdoor activities. All these successes revolve around the recognition that transmission of the virus is primarily via the aerosol route, via small particles that hang in the air for long periods of time, a scientific fact that was not entirely clear as the pandemic began. Things we got wrong included an erroneous focus on feared contamination of fomites (objects that may carry infectious agents), which produced misguided and ridiculous practices like washing groceries, erecting Plexiglas barriers, and massive efforts to sterilize and sanitize inanimate objects and environments. We focused too much on large droplets for transmission which led us to place excessive faith in the infamous six-foot rule, and too little emphasis on good ventilation in indoor spaces. Lessons and Forecasts So what can we conclude so far? The virus is completely nonpartisan. We have exposed wide cracks and fissures in our healthcare system, amplifying already extant disparities in healthcare access and delivery among disadvantaged groups and people of color. We have revealed the FDA and the CDC to be insufficiently nimble to meet the exigencies of a rapidly evolving pandemic. We have exposed huge weaknesses in our supply chains. We need better ventilation and air quality in our schools and office buildings. Most important, we exposed our loss of communitarian spirit and our lack of dedication to the common good. If we can't come together to combat a once-in-a-century pandemic, when will we come together in common cause? What does the future hold? As many others have said, this virus will become endemic, part of the ongoing pathogen landscape, and will surface in intermittent outbreaks, primarily among the unvaccinated. Children down to the age of 6 months will receive COVID vaccine, which will become part of the routine childhood immunization schedule. Some of us have already received booster doses of vaccine; boosters will likely be available for most if not all adults soon. COVID vaccine will be incorporated into the annual flu shot, which we will receive annually to keep immunity from waning. In areas of outbreak, mask wearing indoors will be recommended and mask wearing, as needed, will become accepted and routine. Furthermore, we must search for lessons learned as we examine what went well and what did not go well, including how to better ventilate our indoor spaces and, as a collateral benefit, how to prevent influenza illness and death going forward. Sooner or later, there will be another pandemic for which we must be better prepared. Above all, we must heal our national divide and return to caring about our neighbors and the common good before the next catastrophe arrives.

As the U.S. underwent its most intense wave of Covid-19 illnesses and deaths in winter of 2021, there was one virological silver lining: Influenza all but disappeared. Now officials are worried about what a potential uptick in flu cases could mean for public health.In its report on the 2020–2021 influenza season (which ran from late September to late May), the Colorado Department of Public Health & Environment concluded that the season “was markedly less severe than previous seasons.” During this time, the state recorded 34 hospitalizations associated with influenza, compared to 3,546 during the previous season, according to CDC data. The state’s flu death toll also fell, to six people. (Some 152 Coloradans died from the flu in the 2019–2020 season.) And for the first time since 2013–2014, there were no deaths in the state among residents younger than 18.Last month, Boulder County Public Health released a statement warning about rising flu cases among Boulder residents ages 18-25, including two hospitalizations. “We are highly concerned about the potential impacts from a more active flu season,” said Carol Helwig, communicable disease control coordinator for Boulder County Public Health. “The surge in people impacted by Covid-19 illness in Boulder County over the past few weeks is already creating a substantial strain on hospitals, clinics and our whole health care system, and an active flu season could create an even greater strain and challenges.” An analysis of the CDC’s FluView data bears out Helwig’s concern. During the course of last year’s entire flu season in Colorado, 14 positive test results were reported after more than 66,000 tests. This season, the state has already reached 18 positive results from roughly 10,000 tests.The state has reported only one flu-related death so far this season, compared to five at this point in 2019–2020. In Boulder County, there have been four hospitalizations related to the flu this season.The Colorado Department of Public Health & Environment found that public health safety measures related to the Covid-19 pandemic like masking and social distancing helped mitigate the spread of viral respiratory pathogens not related to Covid-19, including influenza. As with Covid-19, vaccination is also an important tool in the effort to curb widespread transmission of the flu. CDC data shows that Colorado’s flu vaccination rate was virtually the same last season as it was before the start of the pandemic (55.4% versus 55.5%, respectively). Boulder County Public Health urges everyone six months or older to get their flu shot as soon as possible. For more information on getting a flu vaccine in Boulder County, visit Boulder County Public Health’s immunization resources, which include a list of free vaccine providers.

The issue is about Michael Fawcett and Prince Charles himself... The questions for Prince Charles have not been answered."Clarence House said it was "taking this opportunity to reinforce guidance to these charities, particularly in respect of their relationships with supporters".Getty ImagesPrince Charles with Michael Fawcett when he was his valetMr Fawcett was Prince Charles's closest aide for many years, with the prince once saying: "I can manage without just about anyone, except for Michael."He resigned in 2003 after being accused and later cleared of selling royal gifts, but he continued to work as a freelance fixer and events manager for the prince.Clarence House said it would no longer work with his event planning firm last month.The findings of the investigation will be released to the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator for its examination of dealings at the foundation, which is partly based at Dumfries House in East Ayrshire.The investigation also concluded that the foundation's ethics committee process was followed when a £100,000 donation from Russian banker Dmitry Leus, made via the Mahfouz Foundation, was given back.Newspaper reports that this donation had been made in exchange for a meeting with the Prince of Wales prompted the resignation of the foundation's former chairman, Douglas Connell, in September.Mr Fawcett and another unnamed senior employee were subsequently involved in directing a transfer of funds from the Mahfouz Foundation to another charity, the Children and the Arts Foundation (CATA), the investigation concluded.It said this activity took place without the trustees' knowledge.CATA was set up by the Prince of Wales in 2006, but Clarence House said he ceased being its patron in 2019 before this transfer of funds took place.England's Charity Commission has launched an inquiry into whether donations meant for the Prince's Foundation went to CATA instead.The investigation also found:There was no evidence that the foundation's employees or trustees were aware of private dinners being sold or arranged in exchange for moneyThere was no evidence of commissions being paid to society fixer Michael Wynne-Parker or Burke's Peerage editor William BortrickThere was evidence of other commissions being discussed or paid but the foundation said this was "not uncommon" for charitiesONE OF THE MOST DRAMATIC PERIODS IN MODERN ROYAL HISTORY: The Princes and the PressA PROBLEM THAT STARTS IN SCHOOL?: Zara McDermott investigates sexism and 'rape culture' in BritainCEO quits Charles' charity amid honours inquiryCharles foundation chair quits amid access claimsCharles has 'no knowledge' of aide honours claimKing Charles IIIRelatedNation falls silent as King leads Remembrance ceremony14 hrs agoUKSix D-Day veterans pay tribute on poignant Remembrance Day15 hrs agoPoliticsWatch: Royals and veterans attend Cenotaph ceremony18 hrs agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsUS ElectionSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthVideoLiveAudioWeatherBBC ShopBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoContact technical supportCopyright 2024 BBC.

Shop Donate December 2, 2021 Can I get the COVID-19 vaccine if I am sick? Vaccines Sarah Whitley Coles, MD A: It depends! You should not get the vaccine while sick with COVID-19, but other mild illnesses are not necessarily a reason to delay vaccination. Tis the season of colds and flu stacking right up on top of increasing COVID-19 infections. That means lots of folks are getting sick right now with all kinds of viral illnesses. As we are continuing to work to increase both COVID-19 and influenza vaccination rates, you might find yourself feeling under the weather right around when you are getting these shots. So, the question is: Can I go ahead and get the vaccine? If you are sick with COVID-19 and still in the isolation period, the answer is a clear no. Vaccination should be delayed until you are feeling better and you have met criteria to stop isolation (which for most people is 10 days after symptom onset AND no fever for at least 24 hours AND significant improvement in other symptoms). This helps protect the healthcare worker giving the vaccine and prevents confusing any of those reactogenic side effects of the vaccine (like fever, fatigue, muscle aches, etc) with new or worsening COVID-19 infection symptoms. Once your isolation is done, you can go ahead and get the COVID-19 vaccine right away. There is no minimal amount of time you have to wait. And we know that COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective for people who already had COVID-19 infection. For other illnesses, it all depends on how sick you are and how you are feeling. If you have moderate to severe illness, you should wait until you get better. This helps prevent confusion about new symptoms (is it from the vaccine or from the illness?), gives your body some time to rest, and may help prevent any possible adverse events from the vaccine during times of severe sickness. Once the illness has resolved or improved, you can get vaccinated! Hospitalized patients are often vaccinated (usually flu or pneumococcal vaccines but increasingly the COVID-19 vaccine as well!) when they are getting well enough to go home. For milder symptoms (and once COVID-19 is ruled out!), like a runny nose, sore throat, headaches or just feeling a little yucky, you can go ahead and get the vaccine (just don’t forget your mask to protect your healthcare team). Fever in mild illnesses is not a reason to skip a vaccine. Vaccines given during mild illnesses have been shown to be safe and effective. The immune system continues to do its job to respond to a vaccine even when you are a little bit sick. Anyone with kids knows that they are constantly getting some cold or other, and if we wait to vaccinate, we miss opportunities and can worsen vaccination rates. Good news: All of the above information holds true for the influenza vaccine as well! And don’t forget you can get the COVID-19 vaccine and flu shot at the same time. 😉 If you aren’t feeling very well, our best advice is to talk with your primary care clinician about what you can do to feel better but also about when to get your vaccines. They can help sort it out and find the best timing for you. Stay Safe. Stay Sane.

Opens in a new tab or window email article Progress continued on a vaccine against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) for older adults, while the country experienced a resurgence in infections among young children this year that caused the CDC to issue a Health Advisory on the illness. Vaccine Development in Older Adults Continues to Accelerate Janssen's adenoviral vector vaccine against RSV in older adults was safe and effective, particularly against severe disease. Data from the phase IIb CYPRESS trial presented at this year's IDWeek conference showed that the Ad.26 RSV preF-based vaccine had 80% vaccine efficacy (94.2% CI 52.2%-92.9%) against RSV with at least three lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) symptoms and 69.8% efficacy (94.2% CI 43.7%-84.7%) against RSV with at least two LRTI symptoms or one LRTI symptom and one systemic symptom. "One could say the vaccine was 69.8% effective to prevent any symptomatic, acute [RSV] illness," said Ann Falsey, MD, of the University of Rochester in New York. The vaccine was also well-tolerated, with no safety signals, and elicited robust and durable humoral and cellular immune responses. Overall, 5,782 adults 65 and older, including those with "stable" chronic diseases, were enrolled in the study and randomized to receive either vaccine or placebo. The trial began in August 2019 and is slated to last over the course of three RSV seasons, for a total of 2.6 years during which participants will be surveilled for acute respiratory infections. Given these results, the phase III EVERGREEN study of the vaccine is currently enrolling. Elsewhere in vaccine development, Pfizer announced the start of its phase III RENOIR trial (RSV vaccine efficacy in Older adults Immunized Against RSV disease) in September, with its bivalent prefusion F subunit investigational vaccine candidate (RSVpreF) in adults ages 60 and up. Moderna also jumped into the fray, announcing positive pre-clinical data from a single shot COVID/RSV/flu vaccine in September, while its phase II/III study, ConquerRSV, on its vaccine candidate, mRNA-1345, launched in November. RSV Takes 2020 Off But Roars Back in 2021 Some respiratory viruses, such as RSV and flu, took a break during 2020-2021, as incidence in kids dipped in the first year of the pandemic. Data presented at IDWeek found that while kids were still being hospitalized for rhinovirus and enterovirus, the combined positivity rate of influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and other respiratory viruses (39.5%) was significantly lower in 2020-2021 compared to each of the prior three seasons (P<0.001):2019-2020: 75.4%2018-2019: 71.3%2017-2018: 69.4% Researchers analyzed data on 37,676 children (of 69,403 eligible) who presented to emergency departments or were hospitalized for acute respiratory illness and tested positive for a respiratory virus from December 2016 to January 2021 at seven pediatric hospitals participating in the CDC's New Vaccine Surveillance Network. This trend was coupled with the lowest rate of influenza since 1997. CDC researchers found that less than 0.4% of respiratory samples tested positive for influenza per week of flu season, with similar patterns in parainfluenza viruses, RSV, and common human coronaviruses. Sonja Olsen, PhD, of the CDC, said that they expect RSV activity to peak sometime between October and December each year instead of increased circulation in early spring. "As pandemic mitigation measures continue to be adjusted, we might expect to see more changes in the circulation of these viruses, including a return to pre-pandemic circulation as seen for rhinoviruses and enteroviruses," Olsen added. Sure enough, CDC issued a Health Advisory in June 2021 about increased incidence of RSV in parts of the southern U.S. In October, FDA granted emergency use authorization (EUA) for PerkinElmer's PKamp Respiratory SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR Panel 1 assay, an RT-PCR test that can differentiate between COVID, flu, and RSV. Rising Hospitalization Costs for RSV-Related Illness in Kids A study in JAMA Network Open suggested that rising costs of hospitalization for bronchiolitis in infants in the past decade, which is primarily caused by RSV infection, may reflect both changing coding practices and a growing tendency to send young kids to the ICU. From 2010 to 2019, the median standardized cost per bronchiolitis hospitalization among kids 2 years or younger rose from $5,636 to $6,973. At the same time, the proportion treated in the ICU more than doubled, growing from 12.4% to 25.9%, according to data from Pediatric Health Information Systems (PHIS) database.

The Influenza 2017/2018 epidemic and the COVID-19 pandemic were chosen as observational periods to investigate the effect of respiratory virus diseases on these outcomes in a metropolitan area with an established STEMI network. We analyzed data on incidence and care during the COVID-19 pandemic, Influenza 2017/2018 epidemic and corresponding seasonal control periods. Three comparisons were performed: (1) COVID-19 pandemic group versus pandemic control group, (2) COVID-19 pandemic group versus Influenza 2017/2018 epidemic group and (3) Influenza 2017/2018 epidemic group versus epidemic control group. We used Student’s t-test, Fisher’s exact test and Chi square test for statistical analysis. 1455 patients were eligible. The daily STEMI incidence was 1.49 during the COVID-19 pandemic, 1.40 for the pandemic season control period, 1.22 during the Influenza 2017/2018 epidemic and 1.28 during the epidemic season control group. Median symptom-to-contact time was 180 min during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the pandemic season control group it was 90 min (p = 0.183), and in the Influenza 2017/2018 cohort it was 90 min, too (p = 0.216). Interval in the epidemic control group was 79 min (p = 0.733). The COVID-19 group had a door-to-balloon time of 49 min, corresponding intervals were 39 min for the pandemic season group (p = 0.038), 37 min for the Influenza 2017/2018 group (p = 0.421), and 38 min for the epidemic season control group (p = 0.429). In-hospital mortality was 6.1% for the COVID-19 group, 5.9% for the Influenza 2017/2018 group (p = 1.0), 11% and 11.2% for the season control groups. The respiratory virus diseases neither resulted in an overall treatment delay, nor did they cause an increase in STEMI mortality or incidence. The registry analysis demonstrated a prolonged door-to-balloon time during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The effect of these infectious diseases on treatment of patients with STEMI is not well investigated. The Influenza 2017/2018 season and the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic were chosen as observational periods to investigate the effect of respiratory virus diseases on STEMI incidence and treatment in a metropolitan area with a preexisting STEMI network. COVID-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 20201. Previous studies and expert opinions around the world raised concerns about a trend towards decreased ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) admissions, pre-hospital treatment delay, as well as an overwhelmed medical system caused by the pandemic2,3,4,5,6,7. STEMI patients suffer from high mortality and morbidity rates, thus requiring prompt diagnosis and treatment8. After the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China in December 2019, the first case of COVID-19 was documented in Germany on January 27, 2020. On February 25, 2020, the first person in the German state of North Rhine Westphalia was diagnosed with COVID-19. The government of North Rhine Westphalia issued containment recommendations to hospitals on March 3, 2020, and passed a coronavirus executive order on March 22, 20209. This lockdown resulted in contact restrictions, remote work and an extreme reduction of public life and mobility.On the contrary, the Influenza 2017/2018 season—which was declared as epidemic in Europe and was a prototype of a seasonal respiratory infectious disease with high disease burden—did not lead to the implementation of comparable containment recommendations or executive orders10. The influenza season in general was described as predictor of increased incidence of myocardial infarction and might raise the cardiovascular risk of patients with coronary artery disease11,12,13. During the Influenza 2017/2018 epidemic in Germany 334,000 patients were diagnosed with influenza, of these, 60,000 required hospitalization10. The Influenza 2017/2018 epidemic resulted in a doubling of the registered influenza-caused deaths compared to the prior season 2016/201710. The effect of this disease burden on the treatment of STEMI patients was not investigated before.The current study aims to clarify the role of the recurrent influenza season on STEMI care exemplified by the 2017/2018 season. This study was also conducted to evaluate the hypothesized concerns about a decrease in STEMI admissions and treatment delay during the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, it addressed patient- and system-related delay in a myocardial infarction network in the city of Cologne, Germany14,15.MethodsStudy design and populationThis prospective, observational, multicenter cohort study included all STEMI patients diagnosed and treated within the period of December 1, 2013 to April 30, 2020 in the city of Cologne, Germany. The concept of the Cologne Infarction Model network (“Kölner Infarkt Modell”, KIM) has been described previously14,15. Briefly, KIM is a co-operation between all sixteen hospitals and the emergency medical services in the 400 km2 area of Cologne, Germany, populated by about 1 million people. Seven out of sixteen hospitals feature percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) capabilities 24 h a day, 7 days a week. STEMI patients who first presented to emergency medical service were directly transferred to the catheterization laboratories of those PCI centers. Patients who presented to non-PCI hospitals were immediately transferred to hospitals with catheterization laboratory capabilities. Guideline conform STEMI diagnosis required typical symptoms in the presence of either ST-segment elevation in at least two contiguous leads or assumed new onset left bundle branch block (LBBB) on a 12-lead electrocardiogram8,16. All patients with STEMI and a complete report on treatment periods reflecting pre-clinical and in-hospital delay were eligible for the current analysis. The study complies with the Declaration of Helsinki. Ethical approval was issued by the local ethics committee of the University of Cologne (No. 06-064) and written informed consent was obtained from all patients. The KIM registry is funded by the KIM registered association.Observational periodThe first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic began on January 27, 2020 and ended around April 30, 2020 in Germany17. We chose this timeframe for the COVID-19 pandemic observational group. This group was compared to a seasonal control group (pandemic season control group), including all patients treated between January 27 and April, 30 between the years 2014 to 2019. All other patients were excluded because of a potential seasonal effect on health care provision and patients’ behavior.The Influenza 2017/2018 epidemic began on December 25, 2017 and ended around April 30, 2018 in Germany10. The Influenza 2017/2018 epidemic group itself was compared to a corresponding control group (epidemic season control group) treated between December 25 and April 30 during the prior years. Moreover, a direct comparison of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Influenza 2017/2018 epidemic group was performed.Treatment periodsTo address the hypothesized effect of the COVID-19 pandemic and Influenza 2017/2018 epidemic on STEMI treatment time indicators were defined as follows: (1) symptom-to-contact time (S2C, defined as the period from symptom-onset to first medial contact), (2) contact-to-balloon time (C2B, defined as the period from first medical contact to balloon inflation), and (3) door-to-balloon time (D2B, defined as the period from arrival at the PCI-hospital to balloon inflation). Additionally, data on mortality, procedural results and peri-interventional complications were extracted from the registry. Peri-interventional data included the access route, culprit lesion, antiplatelet therapy, the maximum amount of creatin kinase, local bleeding rates and peri-interventional ventricular arrhythmia.Statistical analysisData were described using median [interquartile range], or mean values (± standard deviation), or frequencies and percentages. Extreme values suspected to be implausible data were censored. The Student’s t-test, Fisher’s exact test and Chi square test were used for statistical analyses. All reported p-values were two-sided, and p-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS Statistics Version 26.0.0 (NY: IBM Corp., Armonk).Ethics approvalThe study complies with the Declaration of Helsinki. Ethical approval was issued by the local ethics committee of the University of Cologne.Consent to participateWritten informed consent was obtained from all patients.Results1455 patients were eligible for statistical analysis. The COVID-19 pandemic group included 82 patients and the corresponding pandemic season control group had 358 patients. The Influenza 2017/2018 epidemic group included 54 patients, and the corresponding epidemic season control group consisted of 366 patients. The daily incidence of STEMI was 1.49 during the COVID-19 pandemic and 1.40 (p = 0.677) for the pandemic season control group. Corresponding daily STEMI incidence was 1.22 during the Influenza 2017/2018 epidemic, and 1.28 during the epidemic season control period.Pre-clinical and baseline dataBaseline characteristics are summarized in Table 1a, b. Mean age was 65.7 years in the COVID-19 pandemic group and 63.5 years in the Influenza 2017/2018 epidemic group. Corresponding mean age was 63.6 for seasonal epidemic and pandemic control group. Patients exhibited similar baseline characteristics regarding gender, heart rate at presentation, and initial systolic blood pressure. Documented ST-segment elevation in at least two contiguous leads during 12-lead ECG was the predominant manifestation of STEMI, whereas assumed new onset LBBB occurred less frequently. During the pre-clinical course, 18.2% of patients in the COVID-19 pandemic group suffered from cardiac arrest requiring resuscitation. The rate of cardiac arrest was numerically lower during the Influenza 2017/2018 epidemic (p = 0.299). None of the patients in the COVID-19 pandemic group had a SARS-CoV-2 infection. The results of influenza testing and the use of antiviral therapy were not documented in the KIM registry.Table 1 Baseline characteristics.Full size tableTreatment periodsCOVID-19 pandemicThe treatment periods are summarized in Table 2a, b, and visualized in Fig. 1. Patients in the COVID-19 pandemic group had a median S2C time of 180 [30–390] minutes which was longer than the pandemic season control group (90 [30–351] minutes, p = 0.183). The median C2B time was 89 [69–108] minutes for the COVID-19 pandemic and 78 [64–95] minutes for the pandemic season control group (p = 0.097). Corresponding times for the D2B interval were 49 [27.3–73.3] and 39 [29.8–51.3] minutes (p = 0.038). The median length of hospital stay was 5 days for both groups (p = 0.529).Table 2 Time intervals.Full size tableFigure 1Treatment delay until revascularization.Full size imageInfluenza 2017/2018 epidemicPatients in the Influenza 2017/2018 epidemic group had a median S2C time of 90 [30–240] minutes, which was longer than the epidemic season control group (82.5 [30–300] minutes, p = 0.788). The median C2B time was 80 [63–97.5] minutes for the Influenza 2017/2018 epidemic and 79 [63–95] minutes for the epidemic season control group (p = 0.733). Corresponding D2B intervals were 37 [29.5–60] and 38 [27–51] minutes (p = 0.429). The median length of hospital stay was 5 days for both groups (p = 0.816).In the comparison of both respiratory infectious diseases, the COVID-19 pandemic had longer S2C, C2B and D2B intervals, but none of these differences was significantly different (see Table 2b).Procedural dataThe radial artery was the predominant access route in the COVID-19 pandemic and the Influenza 2017/2018 epidemic group (see Table 3). These proportions were statistically significant different compared to those from the seasonal control groups, as the femoral artery puncture were performed in 64.2 and 70.2 of all procedures in the historical cohorts (p < 0.001). Angiography revealed that LAD occlusion was the most frequent cause of STEMI in all patients, but the proportion of LAD occlusion was significantly higher in patients of the Influenza 2017/2018 epidemic group (55.6%) in comparison to the epidemic season control group (36.7%, p = 0.011). Myocardial infarction of the inferior wall either caused by occlusion of RCA or subsequent branches was the second most common cause for STEMI. After primary angiography 39 patients were transferred to urgent CABG operation. In the remaining cohort, interventional reperfusion (TIMI I-III) was achieved in all but 142 patients.Table 3 Periprocedural characteristics.Full size tablePeri-interventional complications occurred in 8.5% of patients in the COVID-19 pandemic and 5.9% of patients in the Influenza 2017/2018 epidemic group (see Table 4). The corresponding rates were 14.6% and 14.8% for the seasonal control groups. Specifically, in-hospital mortality was 6.1% for COVID-19 pandemic group and 11.0% for the pandemic season control group (p = 0.129). Corresponding rates were 5.9% for the Influenza 2017/2018 epidemic and 11.2% for the related epidemic season control group (p = 0.333). Table 4 Periprocedural complication rates.Full size tableDiscussionMajor findingsThe incidence of STEMI in the metropolitan area of Cologne was steady during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic or the Influenza 2017/2018 epidemic. We observed adequate intervals between first medical contact and revascularization. In detailed analysis, both diseases demonstrated a trend towards an increased patient-related delay compared to each corresponding seasonal control group without significant differences. Additionally, the current analysis showed a prolonged door-to-balloon time during the COVID-19 pandemic. The direct comparison of the COVID-19 pandemic and Influenza 2017/2018 epidemic did not demonstrate a significant difference regarding system- or patient-related delay.STEMI incidenceThe incidence of STEMI was not significantly affected by the respiratory virus diseases in this registry analysis. To our knowledge, this is the first analysis on the effect of the Influenza 2017/2018 season on STEMI care. Over the past years, only few studies investigating the effect of influenza season on myocardial infarction and especially on STEMI incidence or care were published11,12,13. An analysis of the SWEDEHEART registry demonstrated an increased risk of myocardial infarction during the yearly influenza season and a correlation with influenza burden11. In a subgroup analysis STEMI patients were not at higher risk for cardiovascular mortality during the influenza season11. This result is in line with the current study11. Registry data in the United States demonstrated that influenza infection was an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality in patients with myocardial infarction13. Concomitant influenza infection and myocardial infarction reduced the rate of revascularization rate significantly12,13.On the contrary, a large amount of studies regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and the effect on patients with STEMI have been published over the last year. Studies done in Europe and China documented a decrease in hospital admissions for STEMI2,18,19,20. De Rosa et al. reported a 26.5% reduction of STEMI admission during a 1 week period and Scholz et al. detected a 12.6% decrease during a 1 month period18,20. All of these studies were observational studies or registries and might have underreported the true incidence of STEMI during the respiratory virus epidemic and pandemic.Treatment delayRegarding the STEMI treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic the S2C, C2B and D2B were longer compared to the pandemic season control group, but only the D2B was significantly prolonged. The median S2C was 180 min and this was a doubling in comparison to the pandemic season control group. As this was not a statistical significant difference, careful interpretation is required. Nevertheless this difference might have clinical impact and is in line with observations in Europe and Asia. De Rosa et al. and Gramegna et al. observed a relevant patient-related delay with a prolonged symptom-to-hospital and contact-to-balloon time during the COVID-19 pandemic18,21. Interestingly, these studies took place in outbreak areas during the climax of the early COVID-19 pandemic in Italy. A German analysis of 15,800 patients documented comparable S2C, C2B and D2B times for the COVID-19 pandemic and control group without any significant differences20. Multiple studies documented an increase or a trend towards a patient-related delay during the COVID-19 pandemic, but the extent differs between the trials3,4,5,19,20. One potential reason for divergent results is the variance in time frames of COVID-19 pandemic groups. Scholz et al. and Xiang et al. investigated a 1-month period, whereas De Rosa chose a 1-week observation period18,19,20. Daoulah et al. extended the investigation period by analyzing all patients treated over a 4 month period between January 1, 2020 and April 30, 20205. As a result of these heterogeneous approaches, the aforementioned studies came to inconsistent conclusions about the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on STEMI patient care.The reasons for patient-related delay are still under consideration. Altruistic behavior has been intensively discussed. One might further argue that patients avoided hospitals as they represent the focus of this viral disease, and because hospitals were confronted by an excessive demand of intensive care unit capacities by COVID-19 patients. These circumstances might also be an explanation for the observed prolonged D2B time in the current analysis. Results by a meta-analysis from Rattka et al. evolving around 50,000 participants also demonstrated a similar increase in D2B time for the COVID-19 group22.MortalityThe registry data indicate a deceased mortality during the Influenza 2017/2018 epidemic and COVID-19 pandemic period. In the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic, we speculate that the availability of resources due to the reduction in elective procedures could have had an impact on these outcomes. On the other hand, a potentially increased local sudden cardiac death rate might have improved the in-hospital outcome (survivorship bias). The current local death rate of the city of Cologne, Germany is not available, hence the true explanation of this phenomenon is still pending and might be addressed in future studies.LimitationsCologne was not highly affected during the observational period of the COVID-19 pandemic17. Until April 30, 2020, less than 0.24% (N = 2346) of the total population had a SARS-CoV-2 infection17. In contrast, reports by De Rosa et al. and Gramegna et al. included hospitals from outbreak areas with much higher incidence of COVID-19 infections. This might not only have influenced the system, but also the patient-related delay18,21. Inherent limitations of registry studies also affected the current analysis. A short follow-up period, underreporting of outcome data, limited availability of patient characteristics including comorbidities and treatment data leading to missing data restrict the generalizability of our results. Assessment of subjective variables (e.g. symptom onset) and data management by diverse centers might also influence the study results. One additional limitation is the lack of information on the incidence of influenza infection or antiviral treatment in the cohorts. Unfortunately these variables are not part of the KIM registry, but might have biased the current analysis.Another important aspect is the local structure of Cologne with a dense structure of hospitals with short transfer periods and the small sample size in the KIM registry. The current analysis is also restricted by the low number of events especially in the observational groups.ConclusionA well-structured co-operation of emergency medical service and local hospitals in a metropolitan area was able to overcome the challenges in the treatment of patients with STEMI during the COVID-19 pandemic and the Influenza 2017/2018 epidemic. In the setting of this network, these respiratory infectious diseases did not result in a significant overall treatment delay. These virus infections did neither cause an increase in “STEMI incidence” section, nor did they raise the STEMI mortality. Nonetheless, both diseases showed a trend towards an increased patient-related delay. Educational programs should address the observed patient-related delay and emphasize the need for immediate contact of the medical system. Additionally, the results demonstrated a significantly prolonged door-to-balloon time during the COVID-19 pandemic. Adequate strategies to minimize this delay and improve health care service balancing prompt treatment and infection protection are needed.

The new housing measures, which come into force today (Monday 29 November), mean that it is a legal requirement for all bird keepers across the UK to keep their birds indoors and to follow strict biosecurity measures in order to limit the spread of and eradicate the disease. Wild birds migrating to the UK from mainland Europe during the winter months can carry the disease and this can lead to cases in poultry and other captive birds. Public health advice remains that the risk to human health from the virus is very low and food standards bodies advise that avian influenzas pose a very low food safety risk for UK consumers. Solihull Council’s Cabinet Member for Stronger and Safer Communities, Cllr Alison Rolf, said: “I would like to remind all Solihull residents who keep birds – whether on a large scale like farmers or just a few chickens in a back garden – that new measures for housing and looking after your birds come into force today. Please read the guidance from the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) and ensure that you follow it. Enforcement of these measures is carried out by our Trading Standards Officers, working closely with APHA.” The introduction of housing measures means that from 29 November, in addition to housing all poultry and captive birds, keepers must continue taking extra precautions to keep their flocks safe. This includes regularly cleaning and disinfecting equipment, clothing and vehicles when entering or exiting sites and limiting access to non-essential workers or visitors. The Chief Veterinary Officers from across all four nations have worked together to introduce the new housing measures at the same time, meaning that the restrictions apply across the whole of the UK. The new housing measures will be kept under regular review as part of the government’s work to protect flocks. Bird keepers should ensure they understand the new housing measures and are compliant. More information can be found at - https://www.gov.uk/guidance/avian-influenza-bird-flu Do not touch or pick up any dead or sick birds that you find. If you find dead swans, geese or ducks or other dead wild birds, such as gulls or birds of prey, you should report them to the Defra helpline on 03459 33 55 77. Bird keepers should report suspicion of disease in England to Defra Rural Services Helpline on 03000 200 301. Avian influenza is not connected to the COVID-19 pandemic, which is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus and is not carried in poultry or captive birds.

Last week, the disease was confirmed in two wild birds retrieved from the popular North Belfast beauty spot. On Monday, a young swan was found dead in the top pond while park workers received a report of a "very ill" young swan. It's not known if the two cases involve the same bird. Mr Finucane said: “Of course we are all very concerned at these reports of bird flu in the Waterworks and this morning’s news of a young swan being found dead in the park are distressing. “Park users reported a very ill cygnet to the park workers yesterday and were told that the Department For Agriculture had been contacted. “Unfortunately this morning it seems this same young bird appears to be floating dead in the top pond. “I’ve contacted Belfast City Council and the Department For Agriculture to alert them and to raise my concerns. 3 The dead swan in the Waterworks “The Waterworks is one of our most popular parks in Belfast with a large population of wildlife including flocks of swans, geese and ducks and clearly local people in North Belfast are worried that this suspected outbreak of bird flu could have a significant impact. “I’d urge park users to alert park workers if they see anything concerning and I also appeal to people not to approach birds that seem to be in distress. “Hopefully the the situation can be dealt with promptly by responsible agencies and the suspected outbreak can be contained.” A public health warning has been issued by the Public Health Agency. While human infections of avian influenza viruses are rare, they do occur and can cause a fever, cough, muscle pain, a sore throat, runny nose and conjunctivitis. As a result, Public Health Agency consultant Dr Philip Veal has urged people not to touch dead birds or their feathers, to avoid waterside faeces and to keep pets away from the birds. Dr Veal said: “Although human infections with avian influenza are rare, some viruses, such as H5N1 or H7N9, have been associated with human disease. “The symptoms of avian influenza in humans vary considerably depending on the strain or subtype of the virus involved. “Most infections take the form of a flu-like illness, such as fever, cough, body or muscle pain, sore throat, runny nose. Other symptoms can include conjunctivitis – red, sore and discharging eyes.” A PHA spokesperson added: “The vast majority of bird deaths in the UK will not be related to avian influenza, based on information from surveillance activities. 3 Patrolling the Waterworks “However if you find dead waterfowl (ducks, geese or swans) or other dead wild birds, such as gulls or birds of prey, you should report them to DAERA Helpline 0300 200 7840 in Northern Ireland.” New measures were introduced on Monday as part of the Avian Influenza Prevention Zone. Disease control zones have been put in place around all infected premises to mitigate against onward disease spread. Under the new housing measures all bird keepers in the North will be legally required to keep their birds indoors or otherwise separate from wild birds and follow strict biosecurity measures. This applies to owners of pet birds, commercial flocks, a few birds in a back yard or a hobby flock. Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots said: “I took the decision to introduce the new housing measures in order to try to prevent an incursion of avian influenza into the poultry flock in Northern Ireland. "It is now a legal requirement for all poultry and captive bird keepers to keep their birds housed or otherwise separate from wild birds. This decision was based on sound expert advice and in consultation with industry. “This decision to house is an additional step to the Avian Influenza Prevention Zone (AIPZ) introduced on the November 17 and another necessary precautionary measure requiring all bird keepers to keep their birds housed. These housing measures build on the strengthened biosecurity measures that were brought in as part of the AIPZ. “Since my decision to introduce the housing order, we have now discovered avian flu in two wild birds in Belfast – that tells us unequivocally that the disease is already here and in our wild bird population. Keeping it out of the commercial flocks is now down to our poultry sector and the measures they take to keep the disease out. Adhering to, and constant review of, all biosecurity measures is the best weapon we have to avoid an incursion. “My officials will continue to liaise closely with stakeholders and colleagues in GB and the ROI as the situation develops.” Sign up to the daily Belfastmedia briefing to stay up to date with everything Belfast Subscribe to Belfast Media Donate to BelfastMedia.com today to ensure that this website remains free now, free forever Donate Do you have something to say on this issue?

LPAIV infections are usually asymptomatic or cause subclinical symptoms. However, the genetic reassortment of LPAIVs may generate novel viruses with increased virulence and cross-species transmission, posing potential risks to public health. To evaluate the epidemic potential and infection landscape of LPAIVs in Guangxi Province, China, we collected and analyzed throat and cloacal swab samples from chickens, ducks and geese from the live poultry markets on a regular basis from 2016 to 2019. Among the 7,567 samples, 974 (12.87%) were LPAIVs-positive, with 890 single and 84 mixed infections. Higher yearly isolation rates were observed in 2017 and 2018. Additionally, geese had the highest isolation rate, followed by ducks and chickens. Seasonally, spring had the highest isolation rate. Subtype H3, H4, H6 and H9 viruses were detected over prolonged periods, while H1 and H11 viruses were detected transiently. The predominant subtypes in chickens, ducks and geese were H9, H3, and H6, respectively. The 84 mixed infection samples contained 22 combinations. Most mixed infections involved two subtypes, with H3 + H4 as the most common combination. Our study provides important epidemiological data regarding the isolation rates, distributions of prevalent subtypes and mixed infections of LPAIVs. These results will improve our knowledge and ability to control epidemics, guide disease management strategies and provide early awareness of newly emerged AIV reassortants with pandemic potential.

AIV is a zoonotic pathogen and can threaten the health of humans and animals2. AIV is an enveloped, single-stranded, negative-sense, segmented RNA virus3. The genome consists of eight gene segments: basic polymerase 2 (PB2), basic polymerase 1 (PB1), acidic polymerase (PA), hemagglutinin (HA), nucleoprotein (NP), neuraminidase (NA), matrix (M), and nonstructural (NS)4. AIVs are subtyped based on the antigenic diversity of two surface glycoproteins: HA and NA. Differences in the antigenicity and phylogenetics of these surface proteins allow characterization of AIV into subtypes H(x)N(y). To date, 16 HA (H1-H16) and 9 NA (N1-N9) subtypes have been recognized as circulating virus strains in poultry or wild birds, whereas H17N10 and H18N11were newly discovered in bats in recent years5,6. Highly pathogenic AIVs (HPAIVs) and low pathogenic AIVs (LPAIVs) are classified based on virus pathogenicity in poultry7,8. HPAIVs can cause severe disease outbreaks in poultry, resulting in heavy economic losses and posing serious public health concerns9. A few H5 and H7 subtypes are virulent HPAIVs and lead to high morbidity and mortality in poultry10,11. Most AIVs are LPAIVs. LPAIV strains, including the H1-H16 subtypes, and their infections are usually asymptomatic or induce subclinical signs of illness, and the infected animals appear to be healthy or exhibit only mild respiratory disease symptoms with low mortality12. LPAIVs may be silent in wild birds or poultry, but they could pose a risk to human health. For example, H7N9 emerged in the Yangtze River Delta in the spring of 2013 and caused five waves of infections until 2017. Although the H7N9 AIV had low pathogenicity in poultry at the beginning of the outbreak, it became an apparent public health issue due to increasing human mortality, and severely affected public health and socioeconomic development13.The RNA polymerase in AIV lacks proofreading capacity of the eight genes14. Genetic reassortment may occur when two or more AIV subtypes coinfect a single cell, leading to the generation of novel AIV viruses with pandemic potential15. The virulences of novel viruses are unpredictable and may gain the potential to infect humans or different species. It was also reported in recent years that the H6, H9 and H10 subtypes of LPAIVs could cause zoonotic infections. The first human case of H10N8 infection was confirmed on December 17, 2013, and two other cases were subsequently confirmed, but no further outbreak and occurred, suggesting that H10N8 may be sporadic16. The H6N1 virus presented the first case of human infection in Taiwan in June 201317. The H9N2 virus provided six internal genes to the emerging H7N9 and H10N8 responsible for human infection in 201316,18,19. LPAIVs are usually not undiagnosed, evolve continuously and spread in natural hosts. Monitoring LPAIVs is useful not only for public health to prevent AIVs from spreading to humans, but also to monitor circulation in poultry and virus evolution.Southern China has been considered an epicenter of influenza virus due to its poultry breeding and trading style. Guangxi Province is located in the southern part of China. Poultry breeding is extensive and booming in Guangxi Province; there are many large-scale farms and free range backyards, and more than 1.2 billion birds are raised annually. Chicken, duck and goose comprise the primary species in poultry production in Guangxi Province, and the output value is more than Ұ20 billion. In Guangxi Province, chicken farming is the most abundant, and yellow meat chicken is widely consumed throughout the country; Some chicken farms are located on hillsides, where chickens are raised in a free-range mode. Ducks farming is less common than chicken farming, but still accounts for a large number of birds raised; ducks were raised in rivers, in ponds and on seasides farms. Compared to chickens and ducks, geese production occurs on a smaller scale. Guangxi’s seaside cities Beihai and Fangcheng along the Beibu Gulf provide a good resting area for migrating wild birds. In addition, Guangxi Province neighbors Southeast Asian countries and borders Vietnam. Therefore, epidemiological investigation of LPAIVs in Guangxi province is important. At present, comprehensive epidemiological surveillance of LPAIVs in poultry in this region is scarce. Poultry in southern China is mainly traded through live poultry markets (LPMs), where different poultry species are housed together for several days, providing a favorable environment for virus transmission and recombination20,21. There are many LPMs in Guangxi, and the source of poultry in LPMs derived from different farms and free-fenced backyards in the province may vary greatly. Human infections with H5N1, H9N2 and recent H7N9 viruses were associated with exposure to LPMs22,23,24. Continued surveillance of poultry may generate valuable knowledge to support AIV prevention and control. We previously reported on the surveillance of LPAIVs in LPMs in Guangxi from 2009 to 201525,26. In this study, we conducted an LPAIV surveillance study on chickens, ducks and geese in LPMs in Guangxi from 2016 to 2019, and found that LPAIVs exhibited an infection landscape over four-year periods.ResultsLPAIV isolation ratesWe collected a total of 7,567 swab samples from 2,175 chickens, 4,601 ducks and 791 geese in the LPMs of Guangxi Province from January 2016 to December 2019. Among the 7,567 samples, 974 (12.87%) samples were isolated and tested positive for LPAIVs. The yearly isolation rates were 8.00% (113/1413), 16.40% (266/1622), 15.75% (370/2349) and 10.31% (225/2183) from 2016 to 2019, respectively. Higher yearly isolation rates were observed in 2017 and 2018 (Fig. 1). Compared to that in 2016, the isolation rate was twice as high in 2017 (p < 0.001), decreased slightly in 2018, and continued to decrease in 2019 (p < 0.001).Figure 1Yearly isolation rates of LPAIVs in chickens, ducks and geese from 2016 to 2019.Full size imageAmong the 974 LPAIV-positive samples, 71 were derived from chickens, 698 were derived from ducks and 205 were derived from geese. The isolation rates of chickens, ducks and geese were 3.26% (71/2175), 15.17% (698/4601) and 25.92% (205/791), respectively. Geese had the highest rate of virus isolation, followed by ducks and chickens (p < 0.001). The annual isolation rates of these poultry species from 2016 to 2019 are exhibited in Fig. 1. The isolation rate of ducks increased annually from 2016 to 2018 but significantly deceased in 2019 (p < 0.001). The isolation rates of chickens and geese both increased until peaking in 2017 and then decreased annually from 2018 to 2019.The average seasonal isolation rates for the four years are presented in Fig. 2a. Spring and summer had higher isolation rates, whereas the isolation rates of winter and autumn were relatively low (p < 0.05). The seasonal isolation rates for each year from 2016 to 2019 are presented in Fig. 2b. Spring had the highest isolation rates except in 2017, when the highest isolation rate was in summer. Generally, the annual isolation rates of 2017 and 2018 were higher than those in 2016 and 2019 (p < 0.001), so the corresponding seasonal isolation rates were also relatively higher than those in 2016 and 2019.Figure 2LPAIVs seasonal isolation rates. (a) The average isolation rates in the winter, spring, summer and autumn for four years from 2016 to 2019; (b)The seasonal isolation rates in each year from 2016 to 2019.Full size imageDistribution and prevalence of HA subtypes among LPAIVsAmong the 7567 samples, 974 (12.87%) were LPAIV-positive, with 890 single and 84 mixed infections. The numbers of the isolated subtypes and their percentages among species isolates are shown in Table 1. Of all LPAIV isolates, the H3 subtype accounted for the largest percentage, reaching 46.10%, followed by the H6 subtype (29.47%), the H9 subtype (9.03%), mixed infections (8.62%) and the H4 subtype (5.03%). H3, H4, H6, and H9 were the most prevalent subtypes, whereas H1 and H11 were isolated occasionally. Moreover, H1 and H4 were isolated mainly from ducks. Among the chicken isolates, which included four subtypes (H9, H3, H6 and H1), the H9 subtype was predominant, accounting for nearly half (46.48%), followed by H3 (23.94%). The duck isolates included six subtypes that are highly diversified. The H3 subtype was predominant and accounted for more than half (58.88%) of the isolates, followed by H6 (17.19%). The proportions of the other subtypes and mixed infections were all below 10%. The H11 subtype had only one isolate and was derived from ducks. Among the goose isolates, H6 was the most abundant subtype (77.56%), followed by H3 (10.24%), H9 (5.85%), mixed infection (5.37%) and H4 (0.98%).Table 1 Distributions and percentages of the isolated HA subtypes.Full size tableFigure 3 also shows the annual distributions of the isolated subtypes from 2016 to 2019. The trend of the annual distribution was similar to that of the four-year total distribution. In the four years, the H3 subtype had the highest percentage among LPAIV-positive samples each year, followed by the H6 subtype. The percentages of the H9 subtype were higher than those of H4 except in 2019. Twenty-four isolates were identified as the H4 subtype in 2019, accounting for 48.98% (24/49) of all H4 isolates. H3, H4, H6 and H9 were the main subtypes and could be identified in all seasons. Figure 4 reveals their isolation rates in four seasons. The highest isolation rates of H3 and H6 were both observed in the spring, and the H4 subtypes peaked in summer. Higher isolation rates of H9 were observed in winter and summer.Figure 3Percentage of the isolated HA subtypes from 2016 to 2019.Full size imageFigure 4The isolation rates of the H3, H4, H6 and H9 subtypes in four seasons.Full size imageThe HA and NA genes of the identified LPAIV isolates were sequenced and submitted to a BLAST search of the NCBI database. H1N2, H1N6, H3N2, H3N6, H3N8, H4N2, H4N3, H4N6, H4N8, H6N2, H6N6, H9N2 and H11N8 have been identified.The pattern of mixed infectionsThe percentage of mixed infections among the LPAIV-positive samples was 8.62% (84/974). Among the 84 samples with mixed infections, 12 were derived from chickens, 61 were derived from ducks and 11 were derived from geese (Table 1). Notably, the percentages of mixed infection cases were relatively high in 2016, decreased to relatively small percentages in 2017 and 2018, and then increased in 2019 (Fig. 3). Among the chicken isolates, mixed infections accounted for 16.90% (12/71). The percentages of mixed infections of ducks and geese corresponded to 8.74% (61/698) and 5.37% (11/205), respectively (Table 1).As shown in Table 2, 84 mixed infection samples contained 22 combinations. Coinfections with two HA subtypes, which were the most common subtypes, comprised 17 combinations and resulted in 78 cases, accounting for 92.86% of the mixed-infection cases (78/84). Coinfections with three HA subtypes comprising 4 combinations and resulting in 5 cases were observed in chickens (2 combinations, 3 cases) and ducks (2 combinations, 2 cases). Coinfection with four HA subtypes comprised only 1 combination in 1 case and was observed in ducks. Among the cases of mixed infection, H3 + H4 coinfection was the most common and accounted for 33.33% (28/84) of all mixed infection cases and 27 cases were sourced from ducks.Table 2 Mixed infections involving different HA subtypes in chickens, ducks and geese.Full size tableDiscussionThe term “highly pathogenicity avian influenza” (HPAI) generally refers to the strains that may induce an “intravenous pathogenicity index” (IVPI) greater than 1.2 or mortality rate over 75% in a defined chicken population during the specified interval of 10 days. Using this definition, all the HPAI strains isolated to date are of the H5 and H7 subtypes. However, viruses of these subtypes can also be of low pathogenicity. The World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) requires notification for all H5 and H7 subtypes, regardless of their pathogenicity, as they have the potential to mutate into HPAI viruses7. In this study, non-H5 and non-H7 AIVs are assumed to be LPAIVs. LPAIVs are a potential threat to humans, the prevalence of AIV infections should be monitored, and risks should be evaluated early. Prevention and control of LPAIVs should be continuously conducted in the long run. We analyzed the samples based on the data of three poultry species (chicken, duck, and goose), four years (2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019) and four seasons (winter, spring, summer and autumn) and recorded different subtypes of LPAIVs. We generated epidemiological data regarding the LPAIV isolation rates, the prevalent subtypes, and the percentages and distributions of subtypes and mixed infections. The increased isolation rates in 2017 and 2018 (Fig. 1) were mainly correlated with the increased isolation rates of ducks in the two years. The main reason was that the isolation rate of H3 subtype AIV in ducks significantly increased in 2017 and 2018; in addition, 13 out of 16 isolates of H1 subtype AIV were in ducks in 2017. Duck, as waterfowl, is more likely to interact with wild bird species, increasing the chance of AIV transmission across the wild bird-poultry interface, may lead to increased isolation rates in the two years. In Guangxi, spring had the highest isolation (Fig. 2a), and warm, humid and rainy conditions in spring may be favorable for the survival, growth and transmission of AIV. Compared to our LPAIV survey from 2012 to 201526, mixed infections that decreased may be associated with expanding implementation of the “1110” strategy in live poultry markets. The 1110 strategy involves 1 daily cleaning, 1 weekly disinfection, 1 day of market closure every month and 0 live poultry stock overnight. Implementation of the strategy may decrease the isolation rates and mixed infection cases.In the present study, the predominant subtypes in chickens, ducks and geese were H9, H3 and H6 (Table 1), respectively, in agreement with our previous survey results from 2012 to 201526. Waterfowl are well known as a natural reservoir pool for AIV. The water resources of Guangxi are abundant and include many rivers, ponds and lakes etc., which provide good habitat for ducks, geese and other waterfowl. Poultry from LPMs is also derived from backyard farms, in which birds are typically raised as free-range scavengers with minimal to no biosecurity measures. These free-range birds may interact with wild bird species, sharing water, food, and habitat, increasing the chance of AIV transmission across the wild bird-poultry interface. In the present study, it is noteworthy that the proportion of H3 subtypes among the LPAIV samples all increased regardless of poultry species, which was especially obvious in ducks (Table 1). Domestic ducks serve as an ideal environment for the reassortment of H3 subtype influenza with other subtypes, which plays an important role in the ecology of AIV and may potentially be a threat to human health27, and in our study coinfection with H3 + H4 was the most frequently seen combination (Table 2). H3 subtype viruses have very diverse host, ranging from birds to various mammalican species, which may be easier to spread to other hosts by waterfowl and wild birds. Some H3N2 viruses of avian-origin were transmitted to dogs in South Korea, causing acute respiratory disease28. H3 subtype AIV from LPMs in China may contribute viral internal genes to H5N8 HPAIV29. H3 subtype AIV has become an important issue in emerging zoonotic infections and threats to public safety30,31. H6 subtype AIV can cause infection in mammals, for example, an H6N1 virus was isolated from a human with flu-like symptoms in Taiwan in 201317, and an H6N6 virus was also detected in pigs in Guangdong Province in China in 201032. The increased isolation of H3 in ducks and H6 in geese in our study provides an early warning and suggest that the epidemiolohical surveillance and genetic evolution analysis of H3 and H6 subtypes AIV should be enhanced and to find further information to support the prevention and control of AIV.Chickens may play a key role in the evolution of the H9 subtype18. The H9N2 subtype was first identified from diseased chickens in Guangdong Province, China, in 1994 and became widespread among chickens, causing great economic losses due to reduced egg production and high lethality associated with coinfections with other avian pathogens33. Inactivated H9N2 commercial vaccines have been used in chicken flocks since 1998 in China, and the vaccines initially prevented outbreaks and transmission. However, in recent years, genetic alterations in H9N2 virus strains have reduced the effectiveness of vaccines, as H9N2 strains circulate continuously in vaccinated chicken flocks19,34. H9N2 is among the most common subtypes in chickens and can be easily isolated33. In our study, the H9 subtype accounted for nearly half of the chicken isolates (Table 1). Currently, H9 reassortants also comprise H5N2 and H5N6 subtypes35,36, in addition to the above mentioned H7N9 and H10N8 subtypes. The genes exchange or recombination of H9 strains with H5 and H7 etc. subtypes AIV may generate novel gene combinations resulting in emergence of HPAIV strains, which seriously threaten the healthy development of poultry industry and public health safety. The H9 reassortants cases continue to emerge, which may pose serious challenges to the prevention and control of AIV. The findings illustrated that the H9 vaccine needs to be updated.Six subtypes with high diversity and complexity were isolated from ducks (Table 1). The duck is an important waterfowl species. Therefore, we collected more samples from ducks than from chickens and geese. The H4 subtype was mainly isolated from ducks in our study (Table 1). It has been reported that H4 combined with various NA subtypes circulates in LPMs incentral, eastern and southern China, and H4 and other subtypes (e.g., H3) have undergone complex reassortment events in domestic ducks4,37,38,39,40. Our results support the above observations, H4N2, H4N6 and H4N8 circulate, and mixed infections, including H4 are common in Guangxi Province (Table 2). The H4 subtype may have acquired the ability to infect, replicate and transmit in mammalian hosts4,41. Our results and other reports suggest that further investigations of the mechanisms of H4 AIV mutation and reassortment are important to prepare for potential pandemics.Determining the prevalent subtypes of LPAIVs, the distribution and prevalence of these subtypes and the patterns of mixed infections and how they differ among subtypes may provide useful insight and guidance for the prevention and control of LPAIVs. Further epidemiological studies should continue to identify possible risk factors and to better understand the extent of AIV infection as well as potential transmission routes of AIVs. AIVs may occasionally infect humans exposed to infected poultry. Multisectoral coordination at the human-animal-environment interface is critical for zoonotic disease control42. Increasing surveillance in human and poultry populations is crucial for predicting and preventing the risk of new outbreaks. Efforts to collect samples not only from chickens, ducks and geese but also from other minor poultry species and humans as well as from the environment should continue in order to help monitor where AIVs circulate. Extensive surveillance of AIV infection and prevalence in LPMs is indispensable for clarifying the epidemic situation and infection landscape.In conclusion, our study presents a comprehensive analysis of LPAIV infections in Guangxi, southern China from 2016 to 2019. Our results derived from an extensive 4-year effort provide essential surveillance data on the prevalence of different AIV subtypes in chickens, ducks and geese in LPMs, suggesting the need to enhance the monitoring and analysis of the genetic evolution and reassortment of H1, H3, H4, H6 and H9 subtypes AIV, especially for ducks and geese. Meanwhile, biosecurity measures should be improved in farms and LPMs to reduce the transmission of AIV and the occurrence of mixed infection. This information may lay a foundation for reducing the threat of novel or enzootic AIV subtypes of animal and human infections and could provide useful epidemiological data for efforts to effectively prevent and control influenza virus.Materials and methodsEthics statementThe present study was approved and conducted in strict accordance with the recommendations in the guide for the care and use of routinely sampled animals in LPMs by the Animal Ethics Committee of the Guangxi Veterinary Research Institute. Biological samples were gently collected from chickens, ducks and geese using aseptic cotton swabs. The birds were not anesthetized before sampling, and each sampled bird was observed for 30 min after sampling before being returned to its cage. All experiments were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations. All methods were carried out in compliance with the ARRIVE guidelines.Sample collectionThe epidemiological surveillance of LPAIVs in poultry was conducted at 20 selected LPMs in Guangxi Province, southern China. Among these LPMs, six representative LPMs in Nanning (the capital of Guangxi Province) were sampled in turn. Throat and cloacal swab samples from chickens, ducks and geese were collected from January 2016 to December 2019. We collected samples weekly. The sampling buffer was composed of sterile PBS (pH = 7.2) with penicillin (100 unit/ml), streptomycin (10 mg/ml), gentamycin (100 unit/ml) and nystatin (100 unit/ml). We collected throat and cloacal swabs and dipped them in sampling buffer. Swab throat and cloacal samples from the same birds were combined and considered to be one sample. The samples were kept at a low temperature (4 °C). After sampling, the collected samples were transferred to the laboratory for storage and testing. Swabs were cleaned, squeezed dry and discarded after adequate soaking. The swab solution was stored at − 80℃ until use.Virus isolation and hemagglutination inhibition testThe swab solutions were thawed and centrifuged in a sample tube at 3,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was inoculated into10-day-old specific pathogen-free (SPF) chicken embryos (Beijing Merial Biology Company, Beijing, China) via the allantoic cavity. The chicken embryos were incubated at 35 °C after inoculation and were observed daily for the death of chicken embryos. The chicken embryos were chilled if they were still alive 5 days postinoculation, and then the allantoic fluids were collected and identified AIV by hemagglutination (HA) assay, which takes advantage of the tendency of HA protein of AIV to bind to red blood cells (RBCs) causing them to agglutinate. The isolates virus is serially-diluted and incubated with 0.5% RBCs to obtain HA titers. Samples with HA activity were subsequently identified HA subtypes by hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) protocol (https://docplayer.net/15666727-Who-global-influenza-surveillance-network-manual-for-the-laboratory-diagnosis-and-virological-surveillance-of-influenza.html). When antibodies against a specific AIV HA protein bind to the antigenic sites on the HA protein, these sites become blocked and therefore unavailable for binding with RBCs. Briefly, the HAI assay was performed using 96-well microtitre plate, 4 hemagglutination units standardized antigen of isolate was mixed with serially diluted antiserum, and RBCs are then added to assess the degree of binding of the antibody to the HA molecule. The HAI titer was expressed as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution in which hemagglutination was inhibited. All HI assays were performed in duplicate. A panel of reference antiseras were used against different HA subtypes (Table 3), Newcastle disease virus (NDV) and eggdrop syndrome (EDS).Table 3 List of the primary strains used in the preparation of antisera of HAI assay.Full size tableGene sequencing and real-time RT-PCRThe single-infection isolates were further confirmed by plaque-purificationas previously described43, and then used for subsequent sequencing. Mixed-infection isolations were verified by real-time RT-PCR as previously described44. Viral RNA was extracted from viral stock fluid using an EasyPure Viral DNA/RNA kit (TransGen, Beijing, China) according to the manufacturer’s manual. cDNA was synthesized from viral RNA by reverse transcription with the 12-bp primer 5'-AGCAAAAGCAGG-3' as previously described45. PCR was performed using specific primers as described in previous research to obtain the full-length HA and NA genes46. The PCR products were purified with the TaKaRa Agarose Gel DNA Purification Kit Ver. 2.0 (TaKaRa, Dalian, China) and sequenced by Invitrogen of Guangdong Co., Ltd. A BLAST search was performed to compare the sequences against the nucleotide sequences of all known HA and NA genes of AIV in the GenBank database, and the HA and NA subtypes of the isolates were determined and verified.Statistical analysisData statistics were used to determine the differences in isolation rates of LPAIVs from different years, poultry species, seasons and subtypes. The results were analyzed using SPSS 22.0 software (IBM, Chicago, USA), the chi-squared test was used to analyze and compare the differences in these isolation rates, and p < 0.05 was indicative of a significant difference.
