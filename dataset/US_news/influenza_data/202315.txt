Next-generation vaccines which are able to induce mucosal immunity in the upper respiratory to prevent or reduce infections caused by highly transmissible variants of SARS-CoV-2 are urgently needed. We have developed an intranasal vaccine candidate based on a live attenuated influenza virus (LAIV) with a deleted NS1 gene that encodes cell surface expression of the receptor-binding-domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, designated DelNS1-RBD4N-DAF. Immune responses and protection against virus challenge following intranasal administration of DelNS1-RBD4N-DAF vaccines were analyzed in mice and compared with intramuscular injection of the BioNTech BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine in hamsters. DelNS1-RBD4N-DAF LAIVs induced high levels of neutralizing antibodies against various SARS-CoV-2 variants in mice and hamsters and stimulated robust T cell responses in mice. Notably, vaccination with DelNS1-RBD4N-DAF LAIVs, but not BNT162b2 mRNA, prevented replication of SARS-CoV-2 variants, including Delta and Omicron BA.2, in the respiratory tissues of animals. The DelNS1-RBD4N-DAF LAIV system warrants further evaluation in humans for the control of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and, more significantly, for creating dual function vaccines against both influenza and COVID-19 for use in annual vaccination strategies.

Rapid development and deployment of several vaccines for emergency use in humans has significantly alleviated COVID-19 disease caused by infection with SARS-CoV-23,4. However, continuous circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in humans has led to the emergence of highly transmissible variants of concern (VOC) with immune evasion abilities that pose a considerable challenge to efforts to bring the COVID-19 pandemic to an end5,6,7,8. While variants exhibit differing pathogenic properties, with the most recent Omicron variant mainly causing mild disease9, the combination of high transmission rates and reinfections due to immune evasion can still lead to substantial numbers of hospitalizations and deaths, especially among the elderly10. Current mRNA, inactivated whole viral particle and adenoviral vector vaccines are administered intramuscularly and able to induce significant levels of serum antibodies and circulating T cell responses in humans, helping to prevent severe COVID-19 disease or death. Less clear is the level and scope of immunity induced by current COVID-19 vaccines in the upper respiratory tract, where SARS-CoV-2 infection is initiated. The relatively common occurrence of breakthrough infections in vaccinees and repeated SARS-CoV-2 infections in some individuals suggest that alternative vaccine approaches that enhance immunity in the upper airways may be necessary. Enhancement of vaccine-induced immunity in the upper respiratory tract is a key focus in the development of next phase vaccines to reduce SARS-CoV-2 circulation to a low level. Indeed, several intranasally administered vaccine candidates have shown distinct advantages over intramuscularly injected vaccines in inducing mucosal immunity and blocking virus replication in the airways11,12,13,14,15. It is highly likely that SARS-CoV-2 will continue to co-circulate with seasonal influenza to cause annual epidemics. A dual function vaccine to prevent both COVID and influenza may be more acceptable to the general population and cost effective for the post pandemic control of epidemics.We previously reported a panel of live attenuated influenza viruses (LAIV) in which the NS1 gene is deleted from the viral genome (DelNS1) and adaptive mutations support viral replication in embryonated chicken eggs and MDCK cells16,17. We have shown immunization with DelNS1 LAIVs to provide cross-protective, and potentially long lasting, immunity in an influenza infection model16. We further developed the DelNS1 LAIV system, inserting the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 at the site of NS1 deletion, and showed that DelNS1-RBD LAIV prime-boost immunization induced strong systemic and mucosal immune responses to block SARS-CoV-2 infection in a mouse model18. Phase I/II clinical trials with an early version of the vaccine candidate, DelNS1-nCoV-RBD-OPT1 have shown DelNS1-RBD to be well tolerated19. Antibody and T cell responses to the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 were detected among some subjects but we were unable to fully estimate specific immune responses in the airways. Supported by the safety features and promising preclinical evidence, phase III trials to evaluate this vaccine candidate’s potential contribution to current intramuscular SARS-CoV-2 vaccine strategies are currently underway in several countries (http://www.chictr.org.cn/showproj.aspx?proj=133897)20. To further enhance the immunogenicity of the DelNS1-RBD LAIV and address concerns regarding emerging variants, this study presents data on an improved version of the DelNS1-RBD vaccine candidate, tested against current variants in animal models. Our result shows that DelNS1-RBD4N-DAF LAIVs, which facilitate expression of RBD on the cell surface, are highly immunogenic in terms of inducing neutralizing antibodies against the original SARS-CoV-2 strain and current variants, including Omicron BA.2. Notably, intranasal vaccination with DelNS1-RBD4N-DAF LAIVs, but not intramuscular injection of an mRNA vaccine, can block virus replication in the lungs and nasal turbinates of subsequently infected hamsters. This influenza vector vaccine has the potential to serve as a stand-alone prime-boost or supplementary booster immunization to control SARS-CoV-2 circulation and may be developed into a dual function vaccine for both COVID-19 and influenza.ResultsSurface expression and targeted N-glycosylation enhance immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD in NS1-deleted influenza viral vector systemNon-structural protein 1 (NS1) of influenza virus plays critical roles in the viral life cycle21,22. We previously reported an attenuated influenza viral vector system which can be used to express the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 from the site of NS1 deletion (DelNS1-RBD)16,17,18. When administered intranasally this vaccine candidate was shown to effectively boost systemic and mucosal immune responses in animals. The current study further modifies this system through addition of the gene for a membrane anchored protein, decay accelerating factor (DAF)23, to enhance expression of RBD on cellular surfaces (Fig. 1A). Fusing SARS-CoV-2 RBD to a short peptide spanning the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of DAF ensures that it will be properly processed and presented on the cell surface of DelNS1-RBD-DAF LAIV infected cells. As shown in infected MDCK cells, viral vector expressing the RBD-DAF fusion protein resulted in high levels of membrane displayed RBD, compared to the vector encoding RBD without DAF (Fig. 1B). To test if inclusion of DAF indeed enhances immune responses to RBD, we immunized mice with DelNS1 vector, DelNS1-RBD or DelNS1-RBD-DAF LAIVs using a prime-boost scheme (Fig. 1D) and measured total antibodies to RBD and neutralization activity against a pseudovirus expressing the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 six weeks after the prime immunization. Inclusion of DAF significantly increased total anti-RBD and neutralizing antibody levels in mice (Fig. 1E). Also critical is the induction of highly specific immunity to the epitopes located within the core ACE2 receptor-binding region of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. Glycosylation of spike is known to shield viral antigens and may affect exposure of spike protein epitopes for recognition by immune cells24. We reasoned that by shielding non-ACE2 competing epitopes outside the receptor-binding motif (RBM), epitopes within the RBM may be more prominently presented. To test this hypothesis, we constructed an RBD with substitution of four residues outside the RBM (A372T, G413N, D428N and P521N), targeting them for N-glycosylation (4 N) (Fig. 1A). Western blot confirmed an increase in the molecular weight of RBDs where residues were substituted to promote N-glycosylation individually or in combination (RBD4N) (Fig. 1C, upper panel). Intriguingly, glycosylation of these residues seems to increase expression of RBD in cell lines representing a range of mammalian species (Fig. 1C, bottom panel). We then examined immune responses to RBD and RBD4N derived from Beta (B.1.351) or Delta (B.1.617.2) variants of SARS-CoV-2 using the DelNS1-RBD-DAF LAIV system in mice. Mice were intranasally immunized with DelNS1 vector or Beta or Delta versions of either DelNS1-RBD4N-DAF or DelNS1-RBD-DAF LAIVs (Fig. 1D) and total antibodies to RBD (WT, lineage A virus)25 and neutralizing activity measured using surrogate ELISA and pseudovirus assays, respectively. 4N versions of both Beta and Delta RBDs (Beta4N, Delta4N) induced higher levels of antibodies than RBDs lacking 4N modifications (Fig. 1F). Neutralization assays showed that for both Beta and Delta RBDs, additional N-glycosylation enhanced neutralizing antibody responses against pseudoviruses expressing Beta, Delta or Omicron BA.1 variant spike proteins (Fig. 1F). These data demonstrate that fusion with a membrane anchored protein, DAF, to facilitate surface expression of RBD and targeting for additional N-glycosylation to shield non-ACE2 competing epitopes enhances the immunogenicity of RBD in this influenza virus-vectored vaccine system.Fig. 1: Construction and evaluation of DelNS1-RBD4N-DAF live attenuated virus vaccine candidates.A Illustration of construction of DelNS1-RBD4N-DAF. B Immunofluorescence (IF) assay of RBD expression with or without DAF in MDCK cells.

MDCK cells were mock infected or infected with DelNS1-RBD (WT, lineage A virus), DelNS1-RBD with individual N-glycosylation mutations (A372T, G413N, D428N, or P521N), or DelNS1-RBD4N (4N) LAIV virus at an MOI of 1 for 10 h. Cell lysates were analyzed by western blot using anti-RBD antibody and anti-NP antibody. DelNS1-RBD, DelNS1-RBD4N, and DelNS1 LAIVs were also used to infect A549, BHK21 and MDCK cells to detect the expression of RBD. Images are representative of three independent experiments.

Mouse cartoon created with BioRender.com.Full size imageImmunogenicity of DelNS1-RBD4N-DAF variantsSince Omicron subvariants became the major circulating strains in early 2022, replacing Delta and earlier variants, the immunogenicity of DelNS1-RBD4N-DAF vaccine candidates encoding expression of Beta, Delta or Omicron (BA.1) RBDs (Beta4N-DAF, Delta4N-DAF or Omi4N-DAF, respectively) was assessed and compared with that of the BioNTech mRNA vaccine in animals (Fig. 2A), using a prime-boost regimen as described above (Fig. 1D). Both Delta and Omicron (BA.1) DelNS1-RBD4N-DAF LAIV vaccine candidates induced high levels of antibodies specific for the RBD of the original SARS-CoV-2 strain in mice but neutralization assays using pseudoviruses or live viruses showed that each RBD induced more strain-specific antibodies, particularly the Omicron RBD (Fig. 2B–D). To examine if DelNS1-RBD4N-DAF LAIVs induce mucosal immune responses, anti-RBD IgA was measured in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid obtained from immunized mice. Our results showed that both Delta and Omicron RBDs expressed from DelNS1-RBD4N-DAF LAIVs induced IgA against the original strain of SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 2E). In hamsters, Delta and Beta DelNS1-RBD4N-DAF intranasal vaccine candidates induced significantly higher levels of RBD-specific antibodies than did two doses of BioNTech mRNA vaccine (Fig. 2F). Similar to the results from immunized mice, neutralization assays using pseudovirus or live virus clearly showed strain-specific neutralization activity for each vaccine candidate in the hamster model (Fig. 2G, H). Consistent with other reports26,27, parental SARS-CoV-2 (lineage A and basis for BioNTech mRNA vaccine), Delta and Beta spike epitopes induce few cross-neutralizing antibodies to the Omicron variants BA.1 and BA.2 using both pseudovirus and live virus (Fig. 2G, H). It is noted that BNT162b2 induced similar or higher levels of IgG in mice but lower levels of IgG in hamsters than Omi4N-DAF to the wild type RBD (Fig. 2B, F). It is speculated that cell from different species may vary in their mRNA vaccine intake and such difference may influence the immune response. These results indicate that RBDs from different variants of SARS-CoV-2 are immunogenic, inducing serum neutralizing antibodies and mucosal IgA targeting the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, with significant variation in strain specificity.Fig. 2: Immunogenicity of DelNS1-RBD4N-DAF LAIVs in mice and hamsters.A Prime-boost immunization regimen and grouping of BALB/c mice and hamsters. BALB/c mice were prime-boost immunized intranasally with 2 × 106 pfu of Delta4N-DAF, Beta4N-DAF, DelNS1-RBD4N-DAF with Omicron BA.1 RBD (Omi4N-DAF) or DelNS1 vector only control, or through intramuscular injections of the BioNTech BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine (BNT, 5ugand sera collected 14 days after the second immunization for testing of anti-S1 RBD-specific IgG titers (B) (Delta4N-DAF (n = 8 mice), Beta4N-DAF (n = 8 mice), Omi4N-DAF (n = 6 mice), DelNS1 vector (n = 8 mice), BNT (n = 5 mice)). C Neutralization titers against pseudotyped viruses displaying Delta or Omicron BA.1 spike proteins (n = 8 mice for each group), and (D) neutralization titers against live SARS-CoV-2 variants (Delta and Omicron BA.1) (n = 6 mice for each group). E The bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of mice was collected 10 days after boost immunization and anti-S1 RBD-specific IgA titers determined (n = 5 mice for each group). Syrian hamsters were prime-boost immunized intranasally with either 5 × 106 pfu of Delta4N-DAF, Beta4N-DAF, Omi4N-DAF, or DelNS1 vector only control, or through intramuscular injections of the BioNTech BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine (5ug). F Sera samples were collected 14 days after the second immunization and tested for anti-S1 RBD-specific IgG titers (n = 6 hamsters for each group). G Neutralization titers against pseudotyped viruses with wild type, Delta or Omicron spike proteins (n = 6 hamsters for each group), and (H) neutralization titers against live SARS-CoV-2 variants (Delta and Omicron) (n = 6 hamsters for each group).

Induction of RBD-specific T cells by DelNS1-RBD4N-DAF LAIVs representing Delta and Omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2 was evaluated in mice. Mice were immunized through the intranasal route with two doses of DelNS1 vector or DelNS1-RBD4N-DAF containing either the Delta or Omicron (BA.1) version of RBD, four weeks apart, and acute phase T cell responses in lungs and spleens estimated 10 days after boost vaccination (Fig. 3A). As expected, intranasal delivery triggers a greater T cell response in lungs than in spleens, reinforcing that specific airway immunity is better induced by intranasal immunization. While Delta DelNS1-RBD4N-DAF induces similar levels of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, Omicron RBD (BA.1) appears to induce a strong CD4+ response but much lower levels of CD8+ T cells in both lungs and spleens of immunized mice (Fig. 3B, C). This may have been due to the peptide pool used, which was based on parental SARS-CoV-2 (lineage A strain). More variations from the parental (lineage A) strain were observed in the RBD region of Omicron than in Delta (Supplementary Table 2). It remains to be investigated if the Omicron variant induces different CD8+ T cell populations to the parental strain and previous variants of SARS-CoV-2. Decreased proliferative CD8+ but not CD4+ T cells recognizing Omicron compared with those specific for wild-type virus have been observed among infected or vaccinated individuals33. To assess memory T cell responses, mice were prime-boost immunized with DelNS1 vector or Omi4N-DAF (BA.1 RBD) LAIVs and CD45-specific antibodies intravenously injected to label peripheral T cells immediately before mice were sacrificed. CD4+ and CD8+ memory phase T cells (CD45−) were detected in Omi4N-DAF immunized mice but not in vector-immunized controls (Fig. S1A, B). These results indicate that immunization with DelNS1-RBD4N-DAF through the intranasal route can induce acute and memory phase T cell responses in lungs and spleens, with much higher levels of acute phase T cells being present in the lungs.Fig. 3: DelNS1-RBD4N-DAF LAIV induces CD4+ and CD8+ T cell response.A Schedule for immunization of BALB/c mice. At day 10 after the second immunization, lung cells and splenocytes were obtained and stimulated with or without spike peptide pools (Supplementary Table 2) overnight in the presence of BFA. Surface markers (CD4, CD8, and Zombie) were stained, and cells were fixed and permeabilized. Intracellular cytokines (TNFα and IFNγ) were then stained with specific antibodies. Delta4N-DAF and Omi4N-DAF induced IFN-γ and TNF-α positive CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses in lungs (B) and spleens (C) of BALB/c mice. Percentages of IFNγ+ or TNFα+ CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in immunized mice (n = 5 for each group) were compared. Error bars represent mean ± SD. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA followed by Dunn’s multiple comparisons test: ***p < 0.001, **p < 0.01, *p < 0.05, ns not significant. Mouse cartoons created with BioRender.com.Full size imageDelNS1-RBD4N-DAF LAIVs induce sterilizing immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infectionAfter evaluating neutralizing antibodies and T cell responses, we examined protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in mice and hamsters through immunization with DelNS1-RBD4N-DAF LAIVs. To facilitate challenge experiments using the mouse model, we made mouse-adapted (MA) SARS-CoV-2 strains, including Gamma (P.1) and Omicron BA.1 variants. These MA strains replicate efficiently and cause significant body weight loss and disease in mice (Fig. 4A, B and Fig. S2A, B). Immune evasion by Omicron variants has been extensively reported in humans immunized with vaccines or through prior infection with earlier variants5,26. Delta-RBD induce lower levels of cross-variant neutralizing antibodies to Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 than Omicron-RBD (Fig. 2C, D, G). Notably, immunization with either Delta or Omicron (BA.1) DelNS1-RBD4N-DAF LAIVs fully prevented body weight loss in mice and protected them from SARS-CoV-2 infection in lung tissues, with virus being undetectable at days 2 and 4 following inoculation with a mouse adapted Omicron strain (BA.1) (Fig. 4). It is possible that other arms of immunity including specific T cells and mucosal IgA may act together to block and clear the challenged virus. In contrast, unimmunized mice lost more than 11% of their body weight and still had high viral titers in lungs on day 4 after virus challenge. A similar result was observed in mice immunized with Delta4N-DAF and challenged with mouse adapted SARS-CoV-2 Gamma (P1) variant (Fig. S2B, C). Hamster is one of the more susceptible laboratory animal models for SARS-CoV-2 infection, simulating the clinical and pathological manifestations of human COVID-19 disease34,35. We compared antibody induction in hamsters following prime-boost immunization with intramuscular prototype BNT162b2 mRNA or intranasal DelNS1-RBD4N-DAF (Omicron BA.1 or Delta RBD) vaccines, or prime-boost with BNT162b2 mRNA followed by a second boost with either BNT162b2 mRNA or a DelNS1-RBD4N-DAF intranasal vaccine (Fig. 5A and Fig. S3A). All vaccination schemes induced fairly comparable levels of antibodies against the RBD of the parental SARS-CoV-2 strain (lineage A) (Fig. S3B). Pseudovirus-based neutralization assays provided information for understanding specific neutralizing activity induced by each immunization combination. Consistent with an earlier report36, the Delta VOC largely evades antibodies induced by two doses of BNT162b2 mRNA while a 3rd dose booster of either intramuscular BNT162b2 mRNA or intranasal DelNS1-RBD4N-DAF vaccine (Delta or Omicron BA.1 RBD) induces neutralizing activity against the Delta VOC (Fig. S3C), as does a double dose of Delta4N-DAF (Fig. 2G). However, two doses of Omi4N-DAF intranasal vaccine induced only low levels of neutralizing antibodies against the Delta variant (Fig. 2G). In contrast, all combinations except two doses of Omi4N-DAF vaccine failed to elicit significant levels of neutralizing antibodies against the Omicron variants (BA.1 & BA.2) in hamsters (Figs. 2G, H and 3C).Fig. 4: DelNS1-RBD4N-DAF LAIVs protect mice challenged with mouse-adapted Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variant.A Illustration of schedule of immunization, SARS-CoV-2 virus challenge and sacrifice for BALB/c mice. 6–8-week-old BALB/c mice were intranasally prime-boost vaccinated with Delta4N-DAF (2 × 106 pfu) or Omi4N-DAF (2 × 106 pfu) or PBS (n = 8 for each group) and then challenged with a mouse-adapted Omicron BA.1 SARS-CoV-2 strain (Omicron-MA, 1 × 105 pfu) 4 weeks after boost immunization.

Hamsters were prime-boost vaccinated either intranasally with Delta4N-DAF (5 × 106 pfu), Omi4N-DAF (5 × 106 pfu), DelNS1 vector (5 × 106 pfu) or PBS (mock) or intramuscularly with BNT162b2 mRNA (1/6 clinical dose (5ug)) vaccine.

Hamster cartoon created with BioRender.com.Full size imageWe next evaluated protection by intranasal immunization with DelNS1 vector, Delta4N-DAF or Omi4N-DAF LAIVs and compared these to intramuscular immunization with BioNTech mRNA vaccine in SARS-CoV-2 challenged hamsters. Delta, Omicron BA.1 and Omicron BA.2 variants were used in challenge experiments to understand the cross protection afforded by the tested DelNS1-RBD4N-DAF vaccines (Fig. 5A). Challenge with Delta variant caused significant body weight loss (about 6%) in control and most groups of immunized hamsters except for those immunized with Delta4N-DAF (Fig. 5B and Fig. S3D), which completely prevented body weight loss. Consistent with the preservation of body weight, immunization with Delta4N-DAF LAIV prevented virus infection in the lungs and nasal turbinates of Delta-challenged hamsters (Fig. 5C). Intramuscular prime-boost immunization with BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine (based on lineage A strain) or BNT162b2 mRNA prime-boost followed by a second boost with either intramuscular BNT162b2 or intranasal Delta4N-DAF vaccine reduced Delta variant replication 10-fold or more in the lungs and nasal turbinates (Fig. S3E). However, immunization with Omi4N-DAF LAIV failed to block Delta replication in hamsters (Fig. 5C). We then tested whether Omi4N-DAF LAIV could prevent infection with Omicron variants. Omicron variants cause milder disease in humans and are less pathogenic in animal models6,37. When immunized hamsters were challenged with Omicron BA.1 slight body weight loss (2.65%) was observed in control, BNT162b2 mRNA, prime-boost BNT162b2 mRNA combined with a second booster of Omi4N-DAF intranasal vaccine and Omi4N-DAF immunized hamsters, while no apparent body weight loss was observed in the Delta4N-DAF immunized group (Fig. 5D and Fig. S3F). Virus titration in lung tissues and nasal turbinates revealed that only vaccination with strain-specific Omi4N-DAF completely prevented virus replication in the lungs, with only very low levels of virus being detected in the nasal turbinates of one of the Omi4N-DAF-immunized hamsters (Fig. 5E). Interestingly, immunization with Delta4N-DAF also significantly reduced virus replication in the lungs of Omicron-infected animals and completely blocked virus replication in the nasal turbinates (Fig. 5E), suggesting a significant cross protective effect against the Omicron variant being conferred by nasal immunization with Delta4N-DAF. However, immunization with two or three doses of intramuscularly injected BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine caused no apparent reduction in virus titers in the lungs and nasal turbinates of Omicron BA.1-challenged hamsters, while two doses of BNT162b2 plus one dose of Omi4N-DAF intranasal booster reduced viral titers in the lungs 100-fold (Fig. S3G). The Omicron BA.2 sub-lineage and its descendants (BA.2.12.1 and BA.4/5) are more transmissible than Omicron BA.1 and have become the dominant strain in many countries since early 202238. We compared the effectiveness of BNT162b2 mRNA and Omi4N-DAF vaccination in hamsters subsequently challenged with the Omicron BA.2 strain (Fig. 2A and Fig. S4A). Challenge with Omicron BA.2 led to more than 6% body weight loss in mock-immunized hamsters, while immunization with BNT162b2 mRNA and Omi4N-DAF reduced body weight loss to a certain extent, with a stronger effect being observed with the Omi4N-DAF, three-dose BNT162b2 mRNA and two-dose BNT162b2 plus Omi4N-DAF booster vaccination schedules (Fig. 5F and Fig. S3H). Determination of virus titers in respiratory tissues revealed that only Omi4N-DAF vaccination completely blocked virus replication, with lungs and nasal turbinates being virus-free at day 4 post virus challenge, while other vaccination combinations failed to inhibit virus replication in the lungs and did not block virus shedding in the nasal turbinates (Fig. 5G), while BNT162b2 mRNA (two and three doses) or two doses of BNT162b2 mRNA plus one Omi4N-DAF intranasal booster significantly reduced virus titers in the lungs of infected animals but not in the nasal turbinates (Fig. 5G & Fig. S3I). Histopathological examination confirmed the protective effects of the different vaccines in mice and hamsters (Fig. S5A–C and S6A–D). These results demonstrate that nasal immunization with influenza virus-vectored DelNS1-RBD4N-DAF vaccines can provide near-sterilizing immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cross-variant immunity induced by earlier variants against the most recent Omicron VOC is also possible with this vaccine system.DelNS1-RBD4N-DAF LAIV can be used as a dual function vaccine for influenza and SARS-CoV-2SARS-CoV-2 cannot be eradicated, and it is likely to continue to evolve and co-circulate with other coronaviruses and influenza viruses in humans. It is possible that co-circulating SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses may cause annual epidemics. Regular vaccination to boost immunity to emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants may be necessary, as it is for seasonal influenza. A dual function vaccine for both influenza and SARS-CoV-2 may be an option in the future management of these viruses. We have previously shown that DelNS1 live attenuated virus has potential to be developed as another kind of live attenuated influenza vaccine, due to its highly attenuated and immunogenic properties16. This study further tested if DelNS1-RBD4N-DAF LAIVs, which we showed above to protect against SARS-CoV-2, can also be used for protection against influenza virus infection. CA4-DelNS1-RBD (H1N1) and HK68-DelNS1-RBD (H3N2) LAIVs were used to immunize mice before challenge with mouse adapted H1N1 or H3N2 viruses, respectively. Our result showed that prime-boost immunization with CA4-DelNS1-RBD (H1N1) and HK68-DelNS1-RBD (H3N2), respectively, fully protected mice challenged with a lethal dose of H1N1 or H3N2 mouse adapted virus, and completely blocked virus replication in lung tissues (Fig. 6A–E). Examination of specific antibodies to hemagglutinin (HA) and T cells recognizing the nucleoprotein (NP) of influenza virus showed that DelNS1-RBD4N-DAF LAIVs retain the ability to induce immunity to influenza components in immunized mice (Fig. 6F, G). To assess the potential influence or interference of pre-existing anti-influenza immunity on immunogenicity and protective ability of the Omicron DelNS1-RBD4N-DAF LAIV, we tested the effect of prior influenza virus infection on our vaccine and found the prime-boost immunization scheme used is able to induce robust SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies and neutralizing antibodies in mice previously infected with sublethal doses of influenza strains matching the DelNS1-RBD4N-DAF vaccines (Fig. S4A–E). Mice were fully protected after challenge with a mouse-adapted Omicron BA.1-MA strain of SARS-COV-2, no detectable virus titer in the lung tissues of mice on day 2 and 4 post infection (Fig. S4F, G). These results demonstrate that the DelNS1-RBD4N-DAF influenza virus vector vaccine platform has strong potential to be developed into a dual function vaccine for prevention of infection with both influenza and SARS-CoV-2 viruses.Fig. 6: Protection against influenza virus challenge in mice prime-boost immunized with DelNS1-RBD4N-DAF LAIV.A Illustration of schedule of immunization, blood collection and influenza virus challenge for BALB/c mice. BALB/c mice were intranasally prime-boost vaccinated with Omi4N-DAF (2 × 106 pfu) or PBS (n = 6 for each group), and then challenged with mouse-adapted influenza virus strains matching the influenza subtype of vaccines (CA4-) (H1N1, 5 × 103 pfu) or HK68-MA (H3N2, 1 × 104 pfu) (n = 3 for each group)) 4 weeks after boost immunization. Body weight changes in mice following influenza virus challenge were tracked (n = 6 for each group) until the control group reached the body weight loss cut-off (20%) for euthanization, in accordance with animal ethics protocols (B, D). Virus titers in the lungs were measured at 4 dpi (C, E). F BALB/c mice were prime-boost immunized intranasally with 2 × 106 pfu of Omi4N-DAF or PBS (mock) (n = 5 for each group). Sera were collected 14 days after the second immunization for testing of neutralization titers and hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titers against live influenza viruses CA4 (H1N1) or HK68 (H3N2). G At 5 weeks after the second immunization, 2 μg of PerCP-Cy5.5 conjugated CD45-specific antibody was injected i.v. via the tail vein 5 min before sacrifice. Lung cells and splenocytes were obtained and stimulated with or without influenza NP peptides, overnight in the presence of BFA. Surface markers (CD69, CD103, CD4, CD8, and Zombie) were stained, and cells then fixed and permeabilized. Intracellular IFNγ was then stained with specific antibodies. Omi4N-DAF induced NP-specific tissue-resident memory T (Trm) cell responses in lungs (CD45- IFN-γ+ CD69+ CD4+ T cells and CD45- IFN-γ+ CD69+ CD103+ CD8+ T cells) and spleens (CD45- IFN-γ+ CD4+ and CD8+ T cells). Percentages of T cell subsets in immunized (n = 6) and mock (n = 6) groups were compared. MA mouse-adapted. HAI hemagglutination inhibition. LOD lower limit of detection.

Mouse cartoons created with BioRender.com.Full size imageDiscussionSARS-CoV-2 continues to circulate in humans through the emergence of variants with immune evasion ability and optimal host adaptation for more efficient transmission39. The global population is gradually building up basic immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection through either vaccination or acquired infection. However, active circulation of SARS-CoV-2 variants still leads to substantial numbers of reinfections5, impacting human health. Booster vaccinations with current vaccines have helped to alleviate COVID-19 disease but will not provide long term immunity to keep the prevalence of emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2 at low levels40. The next generation of COVID-19 vaccines should focus on preventing infection and/or reducing transmission. Intranasally delivered vaccines that induce stronger mucosal immunity are one such direction for vaccine development41,42. One recent study showed no association between nasal IgA and plasma IgG anti-S1 (Spike) responses and suggested that intranasal boost vaccination is necessary to enhance nasal immunity and reduce reinfection42. Although clinical trials of some intranasal vaccine candidates are currently being conducted20, an early version of our influenza-based DelNS1-RBD LAIV intranasal vaccine for COVID-19 has recently been approved for emergency use in humans in China. We previously reported influenza-based DelNS1-RBD vaccines, demonstrating that prime-boost immunization with these intranasal vaccines or their use together with an intramuscular vaccine candidate induced strong systemic and mucosal immune responses that blocked SARS-CoV-2 infection in a mouse model14,18. We have further evaluated a modified version of the influenza-based viral vector, DelNS1-RBD4N-DAF, in mouse and hamster models in this study. The current version carries two important features; the addition of a membrane anchoring motif, DAF, that optimizes cell surface RBD expression and introduction of four N-glycosylation sites to shield epitopes outside of the receptor-binding motif (RBM) and encourage generation of antibodies specific for ACE2 competing epitopes (Fig. 1). We showed that DelNS1-RBD4N-DAF LAIVs expressing various RBDs derived from variants of SARS-CoV-2 are immunogenic and able to induce both systemic and mucosal specific immunity against SARS-CoV-2 RBD and effectively protect, and in some instances cross-protect, against infection by SARS-CoV-2 variants in mouse and hamster models (Figs. 1–5 and Fig. S1–S6). These influenza-based DelNS1-RBD4N-DAF vaccines distinguish themselves through their ability to induce immunity in respiratory tissues and to provide near-sterilizing immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection.Intranasal immunization specifically induces mucosal immunity in the upper respiratory tissues13,43,44,45. One recent study reported an intranasal Ad-vectored vaccine expressing spike, nucleocapsid, and RdRp antigens that induced complex immunity against SARS-CoV-2 challenge superior to that of intramuscular immunization in a mouse model46. The approval of the first intranasal spray vaccines against COVID-19 in China in December 2022 marked a significant milestone in the development of this technology. About two decades ago, a live attenuated influenza vaccine based on cold adaptation mutants was first used in humans47. The influenza virus has not previously been used as a vaccine vector for other viral diseases, partly due to its compact and segmented viral genome. Identification of adaptative mutations in NS1-deleted (DelNS1) influenza viruses that allow replication in embryonated chicken eggs and MDCK cells provided the opportunity to use influenza virus for the development of new live attenuated vaccines for influenza and other viral respiratory infections16. Because the NS1 protein of the influenza virus is a key virulence element and immune modulator48,49, it follows that removal of the NS1 gene from the influenza virus will make the NS1-deleted mutant virus a better immunogen for triggering the host immune response. Indeed, previous studies of ours and others showed that deletion of NS1 from the viral genome enhances the immunogenicity of DelNS1 live attenuated virus in animal models16,50,51. The inclusion of DAF for cell surface presentation and selective glycosylation of non-ACE2 competing epitopes in the new DelNS1-RBD4N-DAF LAIV vector described in this study have significantly enhanced immunogenicity (Fig. 1). Intranasal immunization with DelNS1-RBD4N-DAF LAIV mimics natural influenza virus infection to deliver the RBD antigen to upper respiratory tissues. Deletion of NS1 makes this influenza viral vector extremely safe for human use, as shown in phase I/II clinical trials19. Notably, the DelNS1 LAIV was found to induce high levels of interferon β in infected cells17. Therefore, this vector can also serve as an adjuvant to enhance the immune response against antigens (in this case, RBD of SARS-CoV-2 expressed from the NS1 site of the influenza virus genome). One of the important properties of this system, compared to currently used vaccines for COVID-19, is the ability to induce immunity that prevents disease and blocks virus replication in the upper respiratory tract, an attribute urgently needed in the next generation of vaccines to slow down or stop transmission of SARS-CoV-2 variants. Most importantly, by incorporating HA and NA matching circulating influenza strains, DelNS1-RBD4N-DAF LAIVs can be constructed to make bi-functional vaccines in response to seasonal influenza and SARS-CoV-2 dual epidemics in the future.MethodsConstruction and generation of DelNS1-RBD-DAF LAIV vaccinesCA4-DelNS1 is the backbone viral vector, derived from A/California/4/2009 (H1N1), from which the NS1 has been deleted. HK68-DelNS1 was made from the CA4-DelNS1 backbone but with HA and NA being derived from A/Hong Kong/1/1968 (H3N2)16. In the NS segment, the NS1 gene was deleted and replaced with SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD sequence. The signal peptide sequence of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) was added to the N terminal of RBD and the sequence for the transmembrane domain of decay accelerating factor (DAF) was added to the C terminal. The DAF peptide (33 amino acids) includes the transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail of the DAF protein. The addition of the signal peptide and the DAF transmembrane sequences to the RBD ensure its proper processing and expression on the cell surface. To direct the immune response to the most important receptor-binding motif (RBM), 4 glycosylation sites were introduced into the RBD to block the non-neutralizing epitopes outside the RBM. Four mutations (A372T, G413N, D428N, P521N) were introduced using a QuikChange kit (Agilent). For virus rescue, eight pHW2000 plasmids containing a version of the NS segment (DelNS1, DelNS1-RBD, DelNS1-RBD-DAF or DelNS1-RBD4N-DAF with RBD derived from WT (lineage A virus), Beta (B.1.351), Delta (B.1.617.2) or Omicron BA.1 strains), HA and NA surface protein segments from A/California/4/2009 (H1N1) or A/Hong Kong/1/1968 (H3N2) and the other 5 influenza virus genomic segments from the CA4 backbone together with an NS1 expression plasmid, were transfected into HEK293T cells using TransIT-LT1 (Mirus) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. After overnight incubation at 33 °C, the DNA mix was removed and MEM supplemented with 1 μg/ml TPCK-treated trypsin (Sigma) was added. Virus supernatant was collected 72 h later and designated passage 0 (P0) virus. Virus was passaged in embryonated chicken eggs for 48 h at 33 °C and then aliquoted and titrated by plaque assay using MDCK cells. In this way, two groups of different subtype LAIVs, CA4-DelNS1-RBD (H1N1) and HK68-DelNS1-RBD (H3N2) were generated, together with empty vector control viruses without NS1 or RBD (CA4-DelNS1 and HK68-DelNS1).To assess the effect of N-glycosylation on RBD expression in DelNS1-RBD4N-DAF LAIV, MDCK (ATCC-CCL-34), BHK21(ATCC-CCL-10) and A549 (ATCC-CCL-185) cells were mock infected or infected with DelNS1-RBD (WT, lineage A virus), DelNS1-RBD with individual N-glycosylation mutations (A372T, G413N, D428N, or P521N), or DelNS1-RBD4N (4N) LAIV virus at an MOI of 1 for 10 h. Cell lysates were analyzed by western blot using anti-RBD antibody and anti-NP antibody.Animal immunization and SARS-CoV-2 challenge.For mouse immunization, 6–8-week-old female BALB/c mice were anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine and then immunized intranasally with 2 × 106 pfu of either CA4DelNS1-RBD (RBD (WT, lineage A virus), RBD-DAF (WT, Delta or Beta) or RBD4N-DAF (Delta, Beta or Omicron)) or empty vector (CA4-DelNS1), or with PBS. After 4 weeks, mice were then boosted with HK68-DelNS1-RBD (RBD (WT), RBD-DAF (WT, Delta or Beta) or RBD4N-DAF (Delta, Beta or Omicron)) or controls (empty vector (HK68-DelNS1) or PBS). For comparison in one experiment, Pfizer-BioNTech (called BioNTech or BNT162b2 henceforth) mRNA vaccine was used to immunize mice intramuscularly at one sixth of the standard human dose (5 μg per mouse). Blood sera was collected at selected time-points for ELISA and neutralization assays. Ten days after boost immunization, some mice were euthanized and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, lungs and spleens collected for ELISA and T cell assay. Four weeks after boost immunization, the remaining mice were challenged intranasally with mouse adapted SARS-CoV-2 strains (Gamma-MA: 5 × 104 pfu, Omicron-MA: 1 × 105 pfu) or mouse adapted influenza strains (CA4-MA: 5 × 103 pfu, HK68-MA: 1 × 104 pfu). Body weight and disease symptoms were monitored daily. At days 2 and 4, lungs were collected for virus titration and histopathological study.To assess the effect of pre-existing anti-influenza immunity, six- to eight-week-old female BALB/c mice were challenged with a sublethal dose containing both wild type CA4 and HK68 viruses (2 × 104 pfu of each virus per mouse) or control PBS. Body weight and disease symptoms were monitored for 2 weeks. At 4 weeks post infection, sera were collected to determine antibody responses against the two WT (lineage A virus) influenza viruses. Mice were then primed with CA4-DelNS1-Omi4N-DAF (2 × 106 pfu per mouse). After 4 weeks, mice were boosted with HK68-DelNS1-Omi4N-DAF (2 × 106 pfu per mouse). As an additional control, a group of control (PBS) mice were sequentially immunized with the empty viral vectors CA4-DelNS1 and HK68-DelNS1. Sera were again collected to determine antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 Omicron virus. After serum collection, mice were challenged with Omicron-MA virus (1 × 105 pfu per mouse). Body weight and disease symptoms were monitored for 4 days. At day 2 and day 4 post infection, lungs were collected for viral titer determination.For hamster immunization, 6–8-week-old male golden Syrian hamsters were anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine and then immunized intranasally with 5 × 106 pfu of either CA4-DelNS1-RBD (RBD4N-DAF (Delta, Beta or Omicron)) or CA4-DelNS1 empty vector, or with PBS control. For comparison, Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine was used to immunize hamsters intramuscularly at one sixth of the standard human dose (5 μg per hamster). After 4 weeks, hamsters were boosted with HK68-DelNS1-RBD vaccines, the BioNTech vaccine or controls, as appropriate. After a further 4 weeks some groups received a second booster immunization. Blood sera was collected at selected time-points for ELISA and neutralization assays. Four weeks after boost immunization, hamsters were challenged intranasally with different SARS-CoV-2 variants at 1 × 104 pfu per hamster. Body weight and disease symptoms were monitored daily. At day 4, lungs and nasal turbinates were collected for virus titration and histopathological study.All animal experiments were approved by the Committee on the Use of Live Animals in Teaching and Research of the University of Hong Kong (HKU) (CULATR) (# 5512-20, 5359-20, 5377-20). All animal experiments related to SARS-CoV-2 were performed in a biosafety level 3 laboratory at HKU.Generation of mouse adapted SARS-CoV-2 virusesTo facilitate experiment using mouse model, we made mouse adapted SARS-CoV-2 from Gamma (P1) and Omicron (BA.1) variants which contain N501Y mutation in the RBD region of spike and can be easily adapted to infect mice. Female BALB/c mice were infected with either Gamma or Omicron variant SARS-CoV-2 viruses at 1 × 105 pfu per mouse. After 2 days, lungs were collected and homogenized in 1 ml PBS, and 50 μl of lung homogenate then inoculated into a naive mouse. Passaging was repeated until the indicated passage number. For each passage, lung virus titers were determined by TCID50 assay. Viruses obtained from the last passage were sequenced using the Sanger method. The sequence of mouse adapted SARS-CoV-2 viruses have been submitted to the GenBank (accession numbers: OQ619133 and OQ619134) and GISAID Database under accession numbers EPI_ISL_12996408 (Omicron-MA) and EPI_ISL_12996407 (Gamma-MA) respectively. Mutations identified in the mouse-adapted strains are included in Supplementary Table 1.Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)Anti-spike WT (lineage A virus) RBD IgG and IgA detection kits were gifts from Wantai Company. Procedures were conducted according to the manual. Briefly, heat inactivated sera or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were 10-fold serially diluted and added to the plate and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The plate was washed 5 times and then incubated with secondary antibody reagent at 37 °C for 30 min. After washing, color development solution was added and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. Stop solution was added and absorbance at 450 nm was measured using a Victor3 plate reader (PerkinElmer).Pseudovirus neutralization assayBlood sera were heat inactivated at 56 °C for 30 min prior to use. The plasmids encoding different spike variants were constructed using vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). To generate SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped virus, HEK293T (ATCC-CRL-3216) cells were transfected with different spike expression plasmids and pNL4-3Luc_Env_Vpr (human immunodeficiency virus type 1 backbone). After 48 h, viral supernatant was aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. Blood sera were serially diluted and incubated with the appropriate amount of pseudovirus at 37 °C for 1 h. The mixtures were then added into HEK293T-hACE2 cell cultures. Two days later, cells were lysed and luciferase activity was measured using Luciferase Assay System kits (Promega) with a Victor3 plate reader. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) was calculated using GraphPad Prism.SARS-CoV-2 live virus neutralization assayHeat inactivated sera were 2-fold serially diluted in DMEM medium and incubated with 100 pfu of the indicated virus at 37 °C for 1 h. The mix was added to confluent Vero-TMPRSS2 cells and incubated for 4 days at 37 °C. After 4 days, cytopathic effects (CPE) were assessed under a microscope, with the neutralization endpoint being the highest dilution with 50% inhibition of CPE.Intracellular cytokine staining (ICS)Lungs and spleens of mice were collected following immunization. Splenocytes were isolated and homogenized through cell strainers (BD) and resuspended in RPMI medium (10% FBS and P/S). Lung tissue was chopped and digested in RPMI solution with collagenase II (1 mg/ml) (Sigma) for 1 h at 37 °C. Red blood cells were lysed by addition of Lysing solution (BD). After washing with RPMI, cells were counted and resuspended in RPMI. Cells were stimulated with RPMI solution containing 1 mg/ml of either WT (lineage A virus) RBD peptide pool (15-mers overlapping by 11 residues to cover the whole RBD) or influenza A virus NP peptides or no peptide control (Supplementary Table 2)16. After 1 h, brefeldin A (BFA) was added to cells and incubated overnight. Cells were then washed with FACS buffer (2% FBS in PBS) and stained with anti-CD8-PerCP-Cy5 (Biolegend-100734), anti-CD4-V450 (BD-560468) and Zombie (BioLegend) for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed and fixed with Perm/wash buffer (BD), and then stained with anti-IFNγ-APC (Biolegend-505810) and anti-TNFα-PE (BioLegend-506306) overnight at 4 °C. Cells were then washed twice with FACS buffer and resuspended in FACS buffer. The samples were acquired with a BD FACSAria III cell sorter and the generated data analyzed with FlowJo V9. Cytokine production was calculated by subtracting the no peptide control background value.To study tissue resident memory T cells, 5 weeks after the boost immunization, 2 μg of anti-CD45-PerCP-Cy5.5 (BD-550994) was injected i.v. 5 mins before sacrifice. Lung and spleen cells were processed and stimulated as above. For surface marker staining, anti-CD69-BV711 (Biolegend-104537) and CD103-BV421 (Biolegend-121422) were included in addition to staining for the original markers (Zombie, anti-CD4-FITC (Biolegend-100406), anti-CD8-APC-Fire750 (Biolegend-100766)). Tissue resident (non-circulating) cells are CD45-. The gating strategy is shown in Fig. S7.Plaque assay and TCID50 assayFor plaque assay, confluent Vero-TMPRSS2 cells in 6 well plates were incubated with 10-fold serially diluted virus for 1 h. The virus was then discarded, and cells washed and overlaid with 1% agarose DMEM and incubated for 3 days at 37 °C. Cells were fixed with 10% formaldehyde for 1 day. Agarose gels were removed, and plaques stained with 1% crystal violet and counted.For TCID50 assay, confluent Vero-TMPRSS2 cells in 96 well plates were incubated with serially diluted virus. After 4 days, cytopathic effects (CPE) were detected under a microscope. TCID50 values were calculated by the Reed–Muench Method.Histopathology and immunofluorescence (IF) stainingOrgans were fixed in 10% PBS buffered formalin and processed into paraffin-embedded blocks. Tissue sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and examined by light microscopy. For IF staining, MDCK cells were mock infected or infected with DelNS1, DelNS1-RBD, or DelNS1-RBD-DAF viruses at an MOI of 1 for 10 h and cells processed using antibodies specific for RBD (red). Nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue).Statistical analysisStatistical analysis was carried out using GraphPad Prism. Data were presented as the mean values ± SD of at least 3 replicates, unless otherwise indicated. Statistical significance was analyzed by either Student’s t test or one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Dunn’s multiple comparisons test. For all tests: ****p < 0.0001, ***p < 0.001, **p < 0.01, *p < 0.05, ns—not significant.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.

Saving Lives, Protecting People Search Submit Influenza (Flu) New CDC Study Identifies Timing of Seasonal Flu Epidemics for 25 Countries in Africa EspaÃ±ol | Other Languages Print Minus Related Pages April 14, 2023 — ­­­A new CDC study published in the Lancet Global Health looked at 10 years of laboratory flu data from 25 African countries in order to provide new, policy-relevant information about when to expect annual flu epidemics. Understanding the timing of flu epidemics is essential for successful mitigation efforts such as vaccination campaigns and antiviral treatment messaging to clinicians. The findings of this study lay the foundation for timely public health interventions with the potential to reduce flu illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths in these 25 African countries. Study authors looked at data from 34 World Health Organization (WHO) member states on the African continent that report surveillance data to Global Influenza Surveillance and Response (GISRS) and used the 25 countries that had at least 3 years of consecutive surveillance data for their analysis. Those 25 African countries are home to 1.1 billion people or 89% of continent’s total population. The authors applied three WHO-endorsed analytical methods to determine the start, peak, and end of seasonal flu activity for these countries and categorize flu epidemic patterns into five groups. Six countries had a northern hemisphere pattern: Algeria, Burkina Faso, Egypt, Morocco, Niger, and Tunisia. Eight countries had a primarily northern hemisphere pattern with some southern hemisphere epidemics: Cameroon, Ethiopia, Mali, Mozambique, Nigeria, Senegal, Tanzania, and Togo. Three countries had a primarily southern hemisphere pattern with some northern hemisphere epidemics: Ghana, Kenya, and Uganda. Three countries had a southern hemisphere pattern: Central African Republic, South Africa, and Zambia. Five countries had no clear pattern: Côte d’Ivoire, Democratic Republic of Congo, Madagascar, Mauritius, and Rwanda. Assessing the timing of flu activity in tropical countries has been challenging in the past because data were sparse in most WHO African countries, and annual epidemics may not have aligned with traditional northern (October-March) or southern (April-September) hemisphere epidemic patterns. However, the extent and quality of flu surveillance data reported by African countries to the GISRS FluNet network has improved substantially in the past decades, making the current analysis possible. Based on these high-quality data, the study was able to identify and describe historical flu epidemics, characterize typical yearly activity, and explore optimal times for interventions. Additionally, identifiable flu epidemic periods can be used to recommend when to start vaccination campaigns with either the northern or southern hemisphere flu vaccine formulations, when to launch antiviral treatment messaging to clinicians, and similarly when to promote preventive measures such handwashing. These findings further support the value of partnerships to enhance global flu surveillance. CDC works with a wide range of international partners, including the World Health Organization, National Ministries of Health, and others to build capacity to respond to pandemic flu and to prevent and control seasonal flu around the world. Additional information on how CDC participates in the Global Monitoring of flu is available.

Study: Risk of Death in Patients Hospitalized for COVID-19 vs Seasonal Influenza in Fall-Winter 2022-2023. Image Credit: CROCOTHERY/Shutterstock.com Background During the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, the mortality rates associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections were thought to be five times that of seasonal influenza infections. However, the rapid development of COVID-19 vaccines and various therapies, including antivirals and monoclonal antibodies, have significantly decreased the number of deaths due to SARS-CoV-2 infections. Furthermore, the clinical care facilities and immunity against SARS-CoV-2 at a population level have also improved, which has reduced the number of deaths due to COVID-19. These changes could also have affected the mortality rates associated with the seasonal influenza virus. About the study The researchers used the United States Department of Veteran Affairs' electronic health databases to enroll participants in the study. The participants had at least one hospital admission record between October 2020 and January 2023, two days before and ten days following a positive test for influenza or SARS-CoV-2 alongside a diagnosis of influenza or COVID-19 upon admission. Individuals with both infections were excluded. Related StoriesStudy finds nirmatrelvir-ritonavir reduces severe COVID-19 and long COVID risks in high-risk patientsPublic trust in COVID-19 vaccine science influences vaccine uptake in the USLink between COVID-19 and long-term risk of autoimmune and autoinflammatory connective tissue disordersThe participants were followed-up for 30 days after hospitalization, until the first event of death, or until latest March 2, 2023. Absolute standardized differences were used to analyze the baseline characteristics of all participants. Cox survival models weighted with inverse probability were used to compare the mortality risk between patients hospitalized with influenza and COVID-19. Propensity scores were calculated while accounting for covariates. The absolute risk was also calculated based on the difference in mortality rates at 30 days between COVID-10 and influenza as the percentage of excess deaths. Additionally, the risk analyses were conducted for subgroups based on age, COVID-19 vaccination status, the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and outpatient treatment with antivirals against COVID-19 before hospitalization. Results The results indicated that the mortality rate associated with COVID-19 among the veteran population during the fall-winter season of 2022–2023 continued to be higher than that of seasonal influenza infections. During the study period, there were 8,996 hospital admissions due to COVID-19, among which there were 538 deaths, while there were 76 deaths among the 2,403 patients hospitalized for seasonal influenza. At 30 days, the mortality rates for SARS-CoV-2 infection and seasonal influenza were 5.97% and 3.75%, respectively, with the excess death rate being 2.23%. The subgroup analysis revealed that COVID-19 vaccination was linked to a decrease in the mortality rate, but the other factors in the subgroup analysis, such as age and antiviral treatment in the outpatient setting, did not affect the mortality rates. Although the mortality rates associated with COVID-19 continue to be higher than the seasonal influenza mortality rates, it must be noted that the death rates for severe SARS-CoV-2 infections requiring hospitalization had decreased substantially since 2020 (when the mortality rates were between 17% and 21%). The seasonal influenza mortality rates have remained relatively steady since 2020 (3.8% vs. 3.7% in 2023). The researchers believe that the decrease in the mortality rate for COVID-19 could be due to multiple factors. These include the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants with lower virulence, increased immunity from multiple doses of vaccines and SARS-CoV-2 infections, and significant improvement in clinical care. The difference in mortality rates between unvaccinated individuals and vaccinated or boosted individuals highlights the importance of COVID-19 vaccines in decreasing the severity and mortality associated with COVID-19. One of the study's limitations is that the study population consisted of predominantly older male veterans, making it difficult to generalize the findings to the larger population. Conclusions Overall, the findings indicated that COVID-19 mortality rates had decreased significantly since the onset of the pandemic. However, the deaths remain higher than those due to seasonal influenza. However, primary and booster vaccines have considerably reduced COVID-19 mortality rates, highlighting the protective effects of the vaccines. Journal reference: Xie, Y., Choi, T. and Al-Aly, Z.

In this excerpt, Young reveals for the first time details of a December 2019 lab safety breach involving one of the world’s most infamous lab-created “gain of function” viruses – and the efforts that were made to downplay the event, avoid notifying health authorities and oversight bodies, and keep the public and policymakers in the dark.Inside the high-security Influenza Research Institute at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, two experienced scientists were pulling ferrets out of their HEPA-filtered cages on a Monday in December 2019. Another researcher, still in training, was also in the room to watch and learn.One by one, the animals were put into a biosafety cabinet, where a solution was washed into their nostrils. It’s a procedure used to collect evidence of infection, and this particular experiment involved exposing the animals to a highly controversial lab-engineered strain of H5N1 avian influenza virus.The virus they were working with that day was far from ordinary, and there should have been no room for the safety breach that was about to happen and the oversight failures that followed.The experiment underway involved one of two infamous lab-made bird flu viruses that had alarmed scientists around the world when their creation became widely known nearly a decade earlier. In each case, scientists had taken an avian influenza virus that was mostly dangerous to birds and manipulated it in ways that potentially increased its threat to humans.In nature, the H5N1 virus has rarely infected humans. But when people have been sickened, usually through close contact with infected birds, more than half died. So it is fortunate that the H5N1 virus isn’t capable of spreading easily from person to person. If the virus were ever to evolve in ways that gave it that ability, it could cause a devastating pandemic.Opinions in your inbox: Get exclusive access to our columnists and the best of our columns'Gain of function' research created controversial flu virusesAnd yet in late 2011 the world learned that two scientific teams – one in Wisconsin, led by virologist Yoshihiro Kawaoka, and another in the Netherlands, led by virologist Ron Fouchier – had potentially pushed the virus in that direction. Each of these labs had created H5N1 viruses that had gained the ability to spread through the air between ferrets, the animal model used to study how flu viruses might behave in humans.The ultimate goal of this work was to help protect the world from future pandemics, and the research was supported with words and funding by two of the most prominent scientists in the United States: Dr. Francis S. Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, and Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.Kawaoka contended it would be “irresponsible not to study” how the virus might evolve in nature. “Some people have argued that the risks of such studies – misuse and accidental release, for example – outweigh the benefits. I counter that H5N1 viruses circulating in nature already pose a threat,” he said at the time.Yet these groundbreaking scientific feats set off a heated international debate over the ethics and safety of “gain of function” research. The controversy continues to this day.Concerns about the safety of biological research have taken on heightened urgency in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and growing acceptance of the possibility that it was caused by a lab accident in China. In February, it was revealed that analysts at the U.S. Department of Energy had joined the FBI in leaning toward a lab accident as the most likely source of the pandemic, though other U.S. intelligence agencies lean toward a natural origin or are undecided.Where's the apology?: COVID may have leaked out of a Chinese lab after all. So much for 'misinformation.'Former U.S. surgeon general: We'll never know the full truth about COVID-19 origins. Political infighting won't help.The story of how the H5N1 viruses came to be created – and how the University of Wisconsin and the Kawaoka lab would later respond to the 2019 safety breach during the ferret experiment – raises uncomfortable questions about the tremendous trust the world places in these kinds of labs.We are trusting that every hour of every day their layers of laboratory containment equipment are working properly, that all of their employees are sufficiently trained, qualified and attentive, and that their written safety and incident response protocols are followed in real-life practice.When something goes wrong, we are trusting that the labs will immediately notify local public health officials who are responsible for preventing outbreaks and the federal authorities who oversee the safety of experiments with genetically engineered organisms.Given that so much about this work is shrouded in secrecy, what happened in Wisconsin raises the question: Should the public give this trust blindly?'Miscommunication' over quarantine alarmed NIH a decade agoIn 2013, six years before the 2019 safety incident with the ferret experiment at Kawaoka’s lab in Wisconsin, another member of his research team accidentally pierced their finger with a needle that had an engineered H5N1 virus on it.It was a moment of poor judgment, human error around 6:30 p.m. Nov. 16, 2013, that set off a series of emergency calls that would eventually raise concerns in the nation’s capital.An expert at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told officials at Wisconsin’s state health department that while the likelihood the scientist would develop symptoms of H5N1 was “low,” the needlestick “should be considered a serious exposure” and treated aggressively. The chief medical officer at the Wisconsin Department of Health Services told the university that the researcher would need to quarantine for seven days and take a treatment-level dose of Tamiflu twice a day for 10 days.Six months earlier, while seeking funding and approval for the controversial experiments, Kawaoka had assured officials at the National Institutes of Health that the university had a designated quarantine apartment.But it turned out that wasn’t the case.So lab officials told the researcher’s family to pack up their belongings and go to a hotel. And the injured researcher was sent to quarantine at home.Officials in the NIH office responsible for overseeing research with engineered organisms were alarmed to learn that the university didn’t have a dedicated quarantine facility for such emergencies.“This policy is not what was communicated to us in Dr. Kawaoka’s application to perform research with mammalian transmissible strains of H5N1,” wrote Dr. Jacqueline Corrigan-Curay, acting director of the NIH Office of Biotechnology Activities, in a letter to the university.A researcher’s home, the NIH told the university, was not an appropriate quarantine site for Kawaoka’s high-risk studies because influenza viruses can be transmissible through the air, and many residences are in high-occupancy buildings, like apartments, that share air exchange and other infrastructure.Trying to provide an explanation, university officials told NIH there had been a “miscommunication” between Kawaoka and the university’s administration. Wisconsin officials noted that the needlestick was not expected to put the researcher at high risk of infection, and that this engineered virus “was determined not to be a mammalian-transmissible strain.”The scientist with the needlestick completed quarantine without showing symptoms or becoming ill.But even if a high-risk incident occurred with a more dangerous strain, UW officials told the NIH, the lab worker would still be quarantined at home.Could an accident have caused COVID-19?: Why the Wuhan lab-leak theory shouldn't be dismissed'I remember it very well': Dr. Fauci describes a secret 2020 meeting to talk about COVID originsIt was a stunning change by the university to a critical safeguard that federal officials thought was in place for the Kawaoka lab’s research. The NIH demanded the university find a dedicated quarantine facility outside of workers’ residences, such as a hospital isolation room, or face the suspension or termination of its grant funding, correspondence shows.The university didn’t want to use the UW Hospital as a quarantine site.Their concerns included that researchers might be unwilling to come forward about potential exposures if they faced being confined in hospital isolation rooms. The university and its medical team also worried about the increased potential for the public to learn about its lab accidents, noting in correspondence that “it would be much harder to control the spread of information and as a result there would be a higher probability of incorrect information being told to (the) general public and potentially members of the media.”The university eventually agreed to NIH’s demands. And on Dec. 24, 2013, the NIH gave its approval for Kawaoka’s lab to resume its research manipulating H5N1 virus strains that were transmissible to mammals.Safety concerns led to US pause on 'gain of function' studiesBy 2014, there was a growing discomfort at the highest levels of the U.S. government about the risk of an accident with an engineered virus.Wisconsin’s needlestick incident, which drew questions within NIH but wasn’t publicly known, was soon followed by a series of high-profile accidents at federal labs in 2014 – from safety breaches with anthrax and avian influenza at the CDC to the discovery of forgotten vials of smallpox that had been kept for decades in a storage room on the NIH campus.In October 2014, citing these federal lab incidents, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy announced a moratorium on new federal funding for certain gain-of-function research while the risks and benefits of the controversial experiments were studied.The funding pause remained in place for three years until it was finally lifted in December 2017. But it was only in 2019 that some of the halted experiments were quietly allowed to begin again under a revised federal oversight process, which was criticized for keeping secret the details of the new experiments and the basis for the government approvals.The Kawaoka lab was one of the first to receive approval and NIH funding.Not long after the Kawaoka lab was greenlighted in 2019 to resume work with its infamous lab-created H5N1 influenza virus – the one that had helped spark the worldwide debate over gain-of-function research – there was an accident.And in the days and weeks that followed, efforts were made to downplay the significance of the event, avoid notifying public health officials and oversight bodies, and keep the public and policymakers in the dark.A lot was at stake.Not only would the incident draw attention to safety issues at the UW lab, but it also would raise larger questions about the rigor and effectiveness of how the U.S. government was overseeing the riskiest experiments in which scientists are creating enhanced pathogens with pandemic potential.More clues could be found: Deleted COVID-19 genetic fingerprints show it's still possible to dig for lab leak evidenceScientist's air hose detached in lab while working with engineered virusWhen the accident happened on Dec. 9, 2019, Kawaoka’s three scientists were working in an enhanced biosafety level 3 agriculture lab suite at the University of Wisconsin’s Influenza Research Institute.This facility had been built specifically for Kawaoka’s research and featured labs with negative air pressure, watertight and airtight seals, double HEPA-filtered exhaust air and redundant air handling systems.The experiment they were performing involved a virus whose name describes the components of its engineering: VN1203HA(N158D/N224K/ Q226L/T318I)/CA04. It was the virus described in Kawaoka’s controversial H5N1 gain-of-function experiments that had been published nearly eight years earlier, the NIH would later confirm in written responses to my questions.It was the virus that had gained the concerning ability to spread between ferrets and had raised fears it could do this among humans.On that December day, two experienced researchers from Kawaoka’s team were helping train a colleague as they collected samples from ferrets. The animals were part of a transmission experiment and had been in contact with other ferrets infected with this engineered H5N1 virus or another wild-type flu strain.The three scientists wore several layers of personal protection equipment. One of their most important pieces of personal protective equipment was the air-purifying respirator that each wore to ensure they didn’t breathe any air from inside the laboratory. Even though they were using a biosafety cabinet, there was always the potential for virus to be present in the room’s air.These kinds of high-tech respirators encase workers’ heads in a protective hood with a clear face-plate. A blower attached to a belt delivers purified air through what looks like a vacuum cleaner hose that runs up the scientist’s back and attaches to the hood behind their head.Labs are responsible for training workers how to properly assemble and use this kind of equipment.As one of the senior researchers prepared to start collecting samples from the next round of ferrets, the trainee realized there was a problem with their respirator.The powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR) hose had somehow disconnected from the unit that supplied safe, filtered air. Instead, the detached hose dangled loose in the lab’s potentially contaminated air.The hose was “immediately” reconnected, Wisconsin officials later said, and one of the experienced researchers radioed out to the lab’s operations manager as the trainee began the process of exiting the lab, incident records show.The trainee was initially told to follow the lab’s quarantine procedure to keep them from spreading the virus if they were infected. The university would later say this was done “out of an abundance of caution.” But at some point, a lab compliance official released the worker from quarantine.It is unclear whether this quarantine release happened within minutes, hours or days of the incident. Nor is it clear whether university officials first consulted with any public health and oversight agencies.Kawaoka and university officials wouldn’t agree to be interviewed and provided little information in response to my questions.State and local health officials weren't notified about lab accidentIf there were ever a virus requiring that everyone follow safety and incident reporting rules, this was it. The system of oversight in place that day had been created in response to the international furor over this very virus.Yet, after the trainee’s respirator hose disconnected in December 2019, the university didn’t notify local or state public health officials about the incident or consult with them before discontinuing the trainee’s quarantine, despite representations going back years indicating this would occur following “any potential exposure.”The university says it didn’t need to notify them. That’s because UW officials, in consultation with the university’s health experts, made their own determination that no potential exposure had occurred.Officials at Public Health Madison & Dane County, the local health department, told me they defer to the university’s judgment and expertise when it comes to lab safety issues. The department said it “does not need to be notified of something that was determined to not be a significant exposure. It is also not incumbent on us to further evaluate whether there was a significant exposure, if UW reports that there was not.”The university also didn’t immediately alert other key oversight entities that the public relies upon to ensure the safety of this kind of particularly risky research.UW officials waited two months – until Feb. 10, 2020 – to file a report that should have been made immediately to the NIH Office of Science Policy, which oversees U.S. research with genetically manipulated organisms like the engineered H5N1 influenza virus involved in the experiment.Records show the university’s internal biosafety committee, which had approved the Kawaoka lab’s research, wasn’t “apprised” of the Dec. 9, 2019, incident until Feb. 5, 2020.The university was less slow in reporting the incident to the federal funding officials at NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which provided the grant for the controversial experiments. But UW still waited 10 days – until Dec. 19, 2019 – to report the incident to NIAID program staff, according to information provided to me in writing by NIH officials.The grant’s terms required immediate notification in the event of an “illness or exposure.” It was UW’s contention, however, that “neither of the two criteria were met” because there was “no reasonable risk of virus exposure,” NIH officials told me. When the university eventually notified grant officials, it said it was doing so “in the spirit of transparency and responsible conduct of research,” the NIH said.UW officials, who for months wouldn’t answer many of my questions about the incident, eventually said that Kawaoka “informed his program officer at NIH in early December,” before following up with an incident summary on Dec. 19.Opinion alerts: Get columns from your favorite columnists + expert analysis on top issues, delivered straight to your device through the USA TODAY app. Don't have the app? Download it for free from your app store.As I pressed NIH to reconcile the agency’s statement with UW’s account, a few more details emerged. NIH said that the first time UW contacted anyone at the agency was on Dec. 12, 2019 – three days after the incident. That’s when UW first requested a phone call from an NIAID program officer. A first discussion about the incident happened on Dec. 13, and on Dec. 16, during a follow-up discussion, NIAID staff asked UW to send in a written description of the incident.Both NIAID Director Anthony Fauci and NIAID Principal Deputy Director Hugh Auchincloss “were briefed about the incident,” the NIH said in a written response to my questions. But NIH would not tell me when Fauci and Auchincloss were briefed or whether they provided guidance on how the UW incident should be handled.UW officials said Kawaoka’s lab immediately reported the incident to the CDC’s select agent lab regulators. But the university didn’t answer my questions about why the incident was immediately reported to the CDC – and not NIH – given UW’s stated position that there wasn’t any potential exposure.It is unclear whether Kawaoka’s team consulted the CDC in advance of the university’s decision to release the researcher from quarantine. CDC officials – including Dr. Samuel Edwin, who heads the select agent program – didn’t answer my questions about this.University notified federal oversight team 2 months after lab accidentWhen the university finally notified the NIH Office of Science Policy about the ferret incident – two months after it happened – UW officials unsuccessfully tried to justify their significant delay by saying the incident was “not reportable ” because even though the trainee’s PAPR tube had detached, in their view there was “no potential exposure.”The university’s justifications, records show, included that the ferrets had been handled inside a biosafety cabinet and that the contact ferrets had been exposed to infected ferrets for only about 24 hours “and were not shedding virus yet.”The university also told NIH officials that “the air the observer would have breathed during the few seconds the hose was disconnected would have come from inside the PAPR hood, which would have been HEPA- filtered before the hose disconnected.”The lab’s report to the NIH doesn’t say how they determined this.The reason UW finally told the NIH oversight office about the incident was because lab regulators at the Federal Select Agent Program – as well as the NIH office that funded the research – “recommended” it be reported.The report UW finally submitted to the NIH Office of Science Policy includes the following notation: “*Confidential – do not release this information without written authorization of the University of Wisconsin-Madison.”What were the consequences of UW’s delayed reporting of the incident? The NIH Office of Science Policy told me it “reminded the institution about its reporting responsibilities,” and “noted that it should have been immediately reported to OSP.”If NIH delivered that message, UW officials say they never heard it. “This is certainly the kind of information we would have remembered or recorded in notes taken at the time,” a UW spokesperson said by email.UW repeatedly pointed to a short email from an NIH analyst thanking the university for its Feb. 10, 2020, report and adding that “the actions taken in response to this incident appear appropriate.” NIH says this email referred only to UW’s “biosafety actions,” not to the university’s failure to file an immediate report.In the end, the trainee apparently didn’t become infected. But how the university and the lab oversight system handled the incident should be cause for concern.“It is all too easy to sensationalize this research, to misconstrue events, and misrepresent the nature of incidents rightfully reported by institutions to regulatory agencies,” said Kelly Tyrrell, UW’s director of media relations, in a email that spoke in broad brushstrokes about the importance of research, the humanity of researchers, and how sometimes there can be differences in interpretations of incident reporting requirements and about regulations.Tyrrell said that UW takes safety seriously, and that the Kawaoka lab has never had an incident where public health or safety have been put at risk.“There are few people in the world trained to understand the nature of the pathogens involved, the biosafety and biosecurity measures in place and the protocols developed and followed,” Tyrrell continued. “Most people are also not equipped to appropriately evaluate the risk. It is unfortunate that some seek to capitalize on this knowledge gap.”Alison Young is an investigative reporter in Washington, D.C., and serves as the Curtis B.

But a post on social media has spread the false claim that the dip in flu cases suggests that COVID-19 was a hoax. How is COVID-19 transmitted? How is COVID-19 transmitted? SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is spread from person to person through respiratory droplets or particles when infected people cough, sneeze, talk or breathe. Most often, transmission occurs when such droplets or particles are breathed in or land in or on a person’s eyes, nose or mouth. As a result, risk is thought to be highest when people are in close contact with one another, typically within 6 feet or so of an infected person, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Especially in places with poor ventilation, however, SARS-CoV-2 can be spread through small respiratory particles that linger in the air and can reach those who are further than 6 feet away. Such airborne transmissions have occurred in enclosed spaces without adequate ventilation and have often involved exercising, shouting or singing by an infected person. “Prolonged exposure to these conditions, typically more than 15 minutes,” the CDC says, raises the risk of such spread. While it is possible for someone to be infected by touching a contaminated surface, the agency says the risk “is generally considered to be low.” People who are infected with the coronavirus but don’t have symptoms can still spread the virus. Although vaccination reduces the risk of viral transmission, it doesn’t eliminate it — which may be especially true with the highly transmissible omicron variant. The CDC, for example, “expects that anyone with Omicron infection, regardless of vaccination status or whether or not they have symptoms, can spread the virus to others.” Link to this Full Story Measures adopted to slow the spread of COVID-19 — such as wearing masks, keeping six feet apart, washing hands frequently and staying home — also slowed the spread of viruses that cause the flu. That’s likely the reason that recorded cases of influenza dropped dramatically in 2020 and 2021, as explained by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the World Health Organization, and many other researchers and scientists. The flu is caused by influenza viruses that spread mostly through respiratory droplets, similar to the way the virus that causes COVID-19 spreads. Since the 2012-2013 flu season, the average number of flu cases in the U.S. has been around 30 million each year with roughly about 40,000 deaths, according to the CDC, which did not give estimates for the 2020-2021 season because of the low rates of infection. But a post has gone viral on social media showing a graph from the WHO that demonstrates the dip in cases of the flu. The post includes text that references a well-worn but false claim that COVID-19 was a hoax, saying, “One of the greatest mysteries of COVID-19: Where did the flu go in 2020 and 2021?” Social media users responded with comments such as, “Pretty much they repackaged that year’s flu strain as the rona & took away your civil liberties & destroyed the lives and businesses of thousands, if not millions of people.” The post originated on Twitter, where it has amassed more than 7 million views, according to the site, and elicited a comment — “good question” — from Twitter CEO Elon Musk. It then spread as a screenshot meme to other platforms, including Facebook and Instagram, where it generated such inaccurate comments as “COVID is basically the influenza Flu.” We’ve already addressed similar claims that have spun the falsehood that cases of the flu were wrongly counted as or confused with COVID-19. A WHO spokesperson told us in an email on April 12 that the current claim is also “not accurate,” adding, “the surveillance systemsesting for the two are entirely different.” That’s because the flu and COVID-19 are different illnesses caused by different viruses. As we said, the flu is caused by various types of influenza viruses. COVID-19, however, is caused by a specific type of coronavirus that was first identified at the end of 2019 — SARS-CoV-2. That virus spreads more easily than viruses that cause the flu, and COVID-19 has killed 1.1 million people in the U.S. since it emerged just over three years ago, which dwarfs the annual average of roughly 40,000 killed by the flu. COVID-19 killed more than 260,000 people in the U.S. in 2022, according to the CDC. In 2021 it killed more than 470,000 and in 2020 it killed more than 354,000, making it the third-leading cause of death in both years — behind heart disease and cancer — according to the National Institutes of Health. It’s likely to be the third leading cause of death again in 2022, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, although official figures haven’t yet been released. The WHO spokesperson also reiterated the point that’s been made widely by public health organizations and scientists for years: “One of the postulated reasons for the low levels of influenza activity was the effect of lockdowns and travel restrictions during that period.” In fact, the level of recorded influenza cases for one strain of flu virus was so low in that period that researchers thought it may have disappeared entirely. So, it’s wrong to suggest that the dip in recorded cases of the flu during the pandemic is a mystery or that COVID-19 is a hoax. The reduction in flu cases isn’t a mystery, and it’s been explained as the result of widely adopted measures that affect the spread of viruses.

By Monique Brouillette • Illustration by Dung Hoang At the height of the 2014–15 flu season, Andy Pekosz had to shut down his influenza virus research. The professor of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology was experimenting with the seasonal flu virus to understand how it might evolve to outsmart the vaccine. The premise was simple: Let a flu virus evolve in the lab until it acquires mutations to evade the vaccine—and then use that information to design better vaccines. But in late 2014, the NIH froze funding for research that involved tinkering with influenza, MERS, and SARS after a research group created a version of a bat coronavirus that could infect mice and humans. The study sparked public outcry. Scientists claimed the research would lead to better vaccines and treatments for coronavirus, but concern that the virus could escape the lab and cause a pandemic trumped the potential benefits. (The study was ultimately allowed to continue and was published in 2015.) This kind of experiment is known as “gain-of-function” research—a term coined in 2011 after two groups of scientists showed they could modify the bird flu to infect ferrets. The 2014 bat coronavirus studies reignited the debate and spurred the U.S. government to impose a moratorium on the research. Around 20 projects, including Pekosz’s, were paused as the NIH spent the next three years debating how to make the research safer. The moratorium was lifted in 2017 with the implementation of new guidelines specifying that research that increases the transmissibility of pathogens with high potential to cause a pandemic—such as coronaviruses, Ebola, and influenza—would be carefully evaluated for biosecurity risks. For Pekosz’s research, it was too late. The flu mutated before he could study it, rendering his work obsolete. Nature beat him to the punch. Now, gain-of-function research is back in the news. Prompted by theories that a lab leak led to the COVID-19 pandemic, regulatory agencies are once again reevaluating gain-of-function research guidelines. In January, the National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity released the first draft of the guidelines—which recommend greater oversight of more types of research—inspiring a debate between those whose research could be stymied and those who favor tighter restrictions. Defining the Threat A central issue in this debate is that scientists don’t always agree on what “gain of function” means. “The whole term is super vague,” says Gigi Kwik Gronvall, PhD, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security and an associate professor in Environmental Health and Engineering. When the term was coined, “gain of function” meant making a virus more transmissible and dangerous. But over time the term has expanded to include many different types of work, not all of which is worrisome. In October 2022, for example, Boston University researchers caused a stir with their research on the Omicron variant, which had acquired a couple dozen mutations and become less deadly but more transmissible, even among vaccinated people. They wanted to answer a basic biology question: Were these changes related to mutations in the spike protein? To better understand the molecular changes behind Omicron’s virulence and transmissibility, the researchers inserted its spike protein into the original SARS-CoV-2 virus. The new lab-made virus—dubbed Omicron-S—was more virulent than the naturally occurring variant: No mice infected with Omicron died, but 80% of those infected with Omicron-S died. Since both versions had the same spike protein, this told researchers that something else must be responsible for the virulence. Meanwhile, the original SARS-CoV-2 virus killed 100% of infected mice but did not evade immunity. Omicron-S did evade immunity—suggesting that the spike mutations played a role in Omicron’s transmissibility. Public outcry ensued with critics claiming the researchers were doing dangerous gain-of-function research. But Gronvall says the research was misinterpreted. The researchers didn’t make the virus more deadly than it was in nature; they combined two naturally occurring viruses and got one with qualities of both—and made important discoveries about the spike protein. ‘Reasonable Anticipation’ Of top concern in the proposed guidelines is a recommendation for additional review of research that is “reasonably anticipated to enhance the transmissibility and/or virulence of any pathogen.” The problem is that scientists are still learning the molecular and genetic factors that make viruses more deadly, and more research is needed to understand how mutations can affect their severity. As we saw with the pandemic, each time a new variant arose, public health officials had to wait and see how it would impact the population. “If you put me and five other researchers in a room and threw us a couple of case studies, we would probably come to different opinions,” says Michael Imperiale, PhD, professor of Molecular Biology and Immunology at University of Michigan Medical School. Additionally, scientists don’t always know what to expect when they start an experiment. They have a hypothesis, test it, and get the results. “If I was able to ‘reasonably anticipate’ what happened in the lab, I would have gotten my PhD in six months instead of four years,” says Gronvall. The current guidelines only apply to a short list of pathogens with pandemic potential, but the new guidelines could apply to many more species. Imperiale says they could have far-reaching consequences, impacting distantly related fields like microbiome research or even synthetic biology, in which microbes—such as E. coli, which is used today to produce synthetic insulin—are engineered to have special functions. The new guidelines also remove an exemption for vaccine development and surveillance. Many scientists worry that putting hurdles around this research could impede progress that keeps us safe. “Those are the critical elements of defense,” says MMI chair and Bloomberg Distinguished Professor Arturo Casadevall, MD, PhD. “If you add more bureaucratic regulation to the steps that are being done for societal defense, I don’t think that leaves us more secure.” Casadevall also worries that putting the onus on researchers to “reasonably anticipate” whether a virus could become more virulent may stifle important new discoveries. He points to the Johnson & Johnson coronavirus vaccine, which was created by inserting genes for a spike protein into an adenovirus that had been made less infectious. The spike protein genes gave the adenovirus a new function, which is to generate immunity against SARS-CoV-2. “This is the technical definition of gain of function,” says Casadevall. Some scientists may have predicted that this research would make the adenovirus more deadly, and then we might not have the vaccine. In February, he published a paper highlighting many advances that can be credited to gain-of-function research—including the treatment of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, bacterial bioremediation tools, and drought- and pest-resistant crops. At least two FDA approvals stem from imbuing viruses with new functions. One is a cancer therapy called T-VEC that consists of a modified herpes simplex virus that infects and destroys tumor cells. The other was the Johnson & Johnson coronavirus vaccine. Reconcilable Differences Even at the School, opinions are divided on the draft guidelines. CHS director Tom Inglesby, MD, thinks the new guidelines are warranted. “The work isn’t forbidden,” he says. “But if you are going to make a more transmissible strain of Ebola, then you need to have the work reviewed by the U.S. government.” Inglesby thinks government oversight will be reasonable and will consider the benefit of research, such as on vaccines, meant to protect the public. Along with colleagues at Stanford and Harvard universities, Center deputy director Anita Cicero, JD, and fellow Jaspreet Pannu, MD, Inglesby signed a letter commending the new guidelines and recommending additional changes. Similarly, American Society for Microbiology, an organization that represents the interests of scientists, wrote a statement of support for the new regulations. On the other side of the debate are scientists like Pekosz who believe existing regulations suffice. He notes that the CDC sets biosafety levels for labs and requires extensive training and regulation for those with designations BSL 3 (such as those working with pathogens that cause anthrax and tuberculosis) and BSL 4 (e.g., Marburg virus). In addition, universities have institutional review entities, or IREs, that decide whether potentially dangerous research is warranted. A member of the Johns Hopkins IRE, Pekosz has made decisions to not approve research he found too risky. He thinks the public would be reassured if researchers and review boards did more to inform them about the processes in place to protect them. In the weeks and months ahead, scientists and regulatory agencies will be considering the pros and cons and looking for reasonable ways to balance them. “On one hand, you want to protect society against an accidental outbreak or a deliberate act that causes great harm. But, on the other hand, that research enterprise is also society’s first line of defense,” says Casadevall. “Gain-of-Function Research: Balancing Science and Security” was published April 12, 2023.

Here are a few points that can help differentiate between the two. HealthDr. Vikram VoraUpdated: April 10, 2023 2:28 pm ISTBoth Covid-19 and influenza transmit primarily through the respiratory routeThe recent reports of a rise in Covid-19 detections across the country comes on the heels of one of the largest influenza outbreaks in recent years. This year the influenza virus variant responsible for the flu was H3N2 and caused an increase in severity and prolongation of symptoms especially cough.Covid-19 and influenza, both being transmitted primarily through the respiratory route, exhibit a commonality in symptoms, making a definitive clinical diagnosis difficult without a laboratory test for confirmation. However, clinical suspicion is the first step in guiding the diagnosis and understanding the symptoms and small differences in them is important.Common signs and symptoms of Covid-19 and influenzaThe overlap of symptoms between the two conditions is significant. Fever, chills, body aches, headache and fatigue are common. An itching in the throat leading to inflammation followed by a dry severe cough and a runny or stuffy nose is seen in flu and also with the currently prevailing Omicron variant of covid-19. Breathlessness can occur, especially in those with an existing respiratory condition like asthma. Cough is usually dry in nature and can get prolonged both in H3N2 and with long Covid-19. Other symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea may manifest along with the respiratory symptoms.Complications of both these conditions can be debilitating and lead to bronchitis, pneumonia and worsening of pre-existing medical conditions, leading to hospitalization and requirement of oxygen support.How does one distinguish between the two?There are however, several small differences between illness caused by influenza viruses (including H3N2) and covid-19 that can help clinicians towards a diagnosis:Covid-19 infections are more common in young adults and older individuals while influenza targets those below 8 years and above 65 years moreThe onset of symptoms of influenza occurs earlier after exposure (within 1-4 days) while Covid-19 takes longer to manifest (2-14 days). Based on the prevailing variant of either infection, this may change.The cough caused by H3N2 influenza is intense and persistent, leaving the affected individual exhausted. The cough in covid-19 is less severe and can persist only if the individual suffers from Long covid-19Influenza causes lower grade fever (between 99-101o F) than covid-19The feeling of fatigue is much more pronounced in covid-19 as compared to the fluCovid-19 leads to loss of smell or taste, on the other hand influenza does not do soInfluenza also leads to gastrointestinal symptoms like diarrhea, nausea and vomitingBoth illnesses can cause respiratory complications, but covid-19 is more likely to cause severe systemic illness and death, particularly in older adults and those with underlying medical conditions.Preventing covid-19 and influenza:Just as the symptoms of both infections are similar, prevention of infection is also based on common principles.1. Awareness:Creating awareness around the preventive aspects of respiratory infections is extremely important.2. Vaccination:Vaccination is the most effective way to prevent covid-19.Flu vaccines change with the strains (variants) of the flu virus every year and hence, an annual vaccine is recommended for everyone above 6 months of age. This is usually a multi-strain vaccine and provides protection against H3N2 as well.3. Hand hygiene:Human touch their faces several times a day without even realizing it. Washing hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds is a simple yet effective way to prevent the spread of both viruses. Alternatively, using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer can also be helpful when soap and water are not available.4. Masking:Wearing a mask can reduce the spread of respiratory droplets that may contain either the influenza or covid-19 virus. A well-fitted mask, covering both the mouth and nose, protects both the wearer and those around them.5. Social distancing:Maintaining a physical distance of at least 2 meters or 6 feet from others can reduce the aerosolization of respiratory droplets that may contain the virus.6. Cleaning and disinfecting:Regularly cleaning and disinfecting surfaces, especially high-touch surfaces like doorknobs, light switches and countertops, can help to prevent the spread of the viruses.7. Avoiding large gatherings:Avoiding large gatherings, especially indoors, can help to reduce the spread of the viruses.8. Quarantine and isolation:If you have been exposed to covid-19 or H3N2, or if you have symptoms of the flu, staying home and isolating yourself can help to prevent the spread of the virus.Prevention of these infections starts with a change in one's attitude and behaviour towards respiratory illnesses. Do not ignore the symptoms and follow all precautions to stay safe.PromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com(Dr. Vikram Vora, Medical Director, Indian Sub-Continent, International SOS)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

Screenshot by Philip Gruber of Pennsylvania Ag Department map Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Pennsylvania is wrapping up its third wave of avian influenza infections, a year after the state’s first detection in decades.Many of the control areas have been lifted for farms infected in February and March, and the rest could be lifted by April 19. The state has gone a month with no new cases.“We’ve made tremendous progress. It’s been a long road, lots of hard work, and we really should be proud of all the accomplishments that we’ve had so far,” Chrislyn Wood, a USDA veterinarian, told stakeholders April 14. The state has gone through the required three weeks of testing in the live bird market quarantine zone, which covers 207 farms in parts of eastern Lancaster and western Chester counties.The area's surveillance testing will be suspended as long as the disease situation continues to improve, but the quarantine with its other restrictions remains in place, said Alex Hamberg, Pennsylvania’s state veterinarian.The number of public employees responding to the outbreak has scaled back from 160 to 105, Wood said.This spring’s outbreak has largely affected farms in southeastern Pennsylvania that supply live bird markets. Last spring’s highly pathogenic outbreak — Pennsylvania’s first since the 1983-84 disaster — began on April 14 and affected large commercial farms. A smaller fall outbreak hit a mix of commercial and backyard premises.The risk of avian influenza is thought to be highest when wild birds are migrating.During the industry call, Hamberg was announced as Pennsylvania’s new state veterinarian.Hamberg joined the Pennsylvania Veterinary Laboratory in 2014 and advanced to assistant state veterinarian. He joined the Department of Health in December but returned to the Ag Department in April.Hamberg holds degrees from Ohio State and the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine.Hamberg replaces Kevin Brightbill, who had been state veterinarian since 2019 and led the state through the first year of the avian influenza outbreak. According to his LinkedIn profile, Brightbill has become the state’s Region 6 veterinarian, covering the area from Franklin to Lancaster counties.For background on avian influenza, and numbers to call to report an outbreak, go here.

New research from the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity (Doherty Institute) has found that First Nations populations around the world are significantly more likely to be hospitalised and die from influenza compared to non-Indigenous populations. Researchers from the Doherty Institute analysed 36 studies that examined influenza hospitalisations and deaths for First Nations and non-First Nations populations globally, finding that hospitalisation and mortality rates were consistently higher in First Nations communities than corresponding benchmark populations. In Canada, New Zealand and Australia, First Nations people were over five times more likely to be hospitalised with the flu than the benchmark population. The study’s authors note that data on the rates of severe flu in First Nations populations from low and middle income countries was scarce. Senior author of the study and Epidemiologist at the Doherty Institute, Royal Melbourne Hospital’s Dr Katherine Gibney said that more needs to be done to determine the disease burden among First Nations populations in Australia and around the world. “It is critical that governments ensure that people who have the flu have equitable access to healthcare and that vaccination rates are as high as possible,” Dr Gibney said. “When we are planning for seasonal flu, but especially pandemic flu, we need to have specific and targeted plans for First Nations people that are generated by First Nations people. “‘Australia did a fantastic job during COVID of having First Nations-led plans that worked well. And if that can be applied to the flu, it would be incredibly valuable.” Dr Gibney added that surveillance of respiratory virus information is vital for management of the disease. “When we get information about flu hospitalisations and deaths, we need to capture that individual’s First Nations status to determine whether the gap we have described is closing over time, and to continue to advocate for resources to reduce the disease burden in First Nations populations.” Co-author of the study, Monash University’s Dr Juliana Betts said the study also shows the need for systemic and political reform. “Our research emphasises the widespread and ongoing impacts of colonisation on the health outcomes of First Nations communities,” Dr Betts said. “Solutions to these health gaps largely sit outside of the health sector, in policies that address the many social determinants of health including poverty, housing, education and racism.” Peer review: DOI: 10.1371/journal.pgph/0001294 Funding: Funding: The authors received no specific funding for this work.

Flu and all viral infections are virulent if not detected on time and can lead to severe problems, including hospitalisation," Kuldeep Kumar Grover, head of critical care & pulmonology at C.K. Birla Hospital, Gurugram, told."While both are primarily viral infections, with the dual infection patients will be having more cough and nasal symptoms. But if the patients are immunocompromised and their immunity is low, they are more likely to have respiratory issues such as breathlessness. These patients normally end up in ICU with severe complications," he added.A pre-print study, meaning not yet peer-reviewed, reported the case of a 10-year-old girl from Kerala, who was co-infected with SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant and influenza A-H3N2 last year.Data ScienceSQL Server Bootcamp 2024: Transform from Beginner to ProBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView Program Artificial Intelligence(AI)AI-Powered Python Mastery with Tabnine: Boost Your Coding SkillsBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView Program Office ProductivityMastering Google Sheets: Unleash the Power of Excel and Advance AnalysisBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView Program Artificial Intelligence(AI)Basics of Generative AI: Unveiling Tomorrow's InnovationsBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView Program Artificial Intelligence(AI)Master in Python Language Quickly Using the ChatGPT Open AIBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView Program Artificial Intelligence(AI)Mastering C++ Fundamentals with Generative AI: A Hands-OnBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView Program Office ProductivityZero to Hero in Microsoft Excel: Complete Excel guide 2024By - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView Program Office ProductivityAdvanced Excel Course - Financial Calculations & Excel Made EasyBy - Anirudh Saraf, Founder- Saraf A & Associates, Chartered AccountantView Program LeadershipBusiness Storytelling MasterclassBy - Ameen Haque, Founder of StorywallahsView Program FinanceFinancial Literacy i.e Lets Crack the Billionaire CodeBy - CA Rahul Gupta, CA with 10+ years of experience and Accounting EducatorView Program Web DevelopmentA Comprehensive ASP.NET Core MVC 6 Project Guide for 2024By - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView Program MarketingFuture of Marketing & Branding MasterclassBy - Dr. David Aaker, Professor Emeritus at the Haas School of Business, UC Berkeley, Author | Speaker | Thought Leader | Branding ConsultantView Program FinanceFinancial Literacy for Non-Finance ExecutivesBy - CA Raja, Chartered Accountant | Financial Management Educator | Former AVP - Credit, SBIView Program Data ScienceMySQL for Beginners: Learn Data Science and Analytics SkillsBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView Program Artificial Intelligence(AI)AI and Analytics based Business StrategyBy - Tanusree De, Managing Director- Accenture Technology Lead, Trustworthy AI Center of Excellence: ATCIView Program FinanceAI and Generative AI for FinanceBy - Hariom Tatsat, Vice President- Quantitative Analytics at BarclaysView Program Artificial Intelligence(AI)Generative AI for Dynamic Java Web Applications with ChatGPTBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView Program MarketingPerformance Marketing for eCommerce BrandsBy - Zafer Mukeri, Founder- Inara MarketersView Program The school-going girl was taken to the primary health centre with symptoms of low-grade fever associated with cough and cold. There was no associated chest pain or dyspnea, and her vitals were normal with clear chest. She was given symptomatic treatment and all the symptoms subsided after three days."The patient presented in this study was co-infected with the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant and the influenza A-H3N2 virus, as confirmed through genome sequencing data. She recovered quickly with symptomatic treatment without developing any complications," said the researchers in the study, including from ICMR-NIE Chennai, CSIR Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, District Medical Office, Kasaragod, Kerala, and Department of Microbiology, Government Medical College Calicut, Kerala.The report highlighted the importance of genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 co-infections with other respiratory illnesses for understanding the prevalence of co-infections and thus their rapid detection and prevention.According to biologist Vinod Scaria, the estimates of co-infection between Covid and influenza "are variable, and possibly not so rare as we believe it could be"."Co-infections have been associated with a higher rate of morbidity and mortality. It is estimated that 16 per cent of paediatric influenza deaths during 2021-2022 were in patients who were co-infected with SARSCoV2," Scaria, a scientist at CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB), said in a tweet.He stressed the importance of "active case surveillance, follow-up and molecular confirmation of infection"."With wider availability of molecular tools, including genome sequencing ,it is possibly the right time we think of having a diagnosis for all outbreaks. Let us make 'mystery disease' a history," he said.(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)Read More News onOmicrongurugramcovidicuinfluenza(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

Fever, fatigue and persistent cough are among the many symptoms being witnessed in people across the country in the recent past. But, the question is — is it Covid-19 or H3N2 virus that one is down with? H3N2 and Covid-19 both may present flu-like symptoms (Shutterstock) A subtype of influenza A, H3N2 presents symptoms similar to that of Covid-19. But, experts say the former is leading to more cases of hospitalisation at present. Covid-19 cases are also increasing at a steady pace, with 5,676 cases recorded on April 11 in India. “We are getting around 20-30 cases every day of people coming in with flu symptoms. Of these, most are testing positive for influenza,” says Dr AK Jhingan, senior director, Internal Medicine at BLK MAX Hospital. Key differences Though testing is the safest way to differentiate, a cursory understanding of the symptoms may help doctors understand whether one is suffering from influenza or Covid-19 and prescribe tests accordingly. “Both viruses present predominantly with respiratory symptoms as well as flu-like illness, but loss of smell and taste are more common in Covid-19,” says Dr Rahul Roshan, senior consultant, Chest and Respiratory Diseases at a Delhi-based hospital. While influenza may typically severely impact the elderly population and people with co-morbidities, Covid-19 may give rise to serious illness in people of all ages. Also, when infected with influenza, one may experience symptoms within 1-4 days, while in case of Covid-19, it may take 2-14 days for the symptoms to show. “Covid-19 mutates faster and attacks the lungs early, whereas influenza may affect the lungs a little later,” says Dr Sunny Kalra, senior consultant, Respiratory Medicine at a Delhi-based hospital. Coughing is a common symptom. But, it is more prevalent in case of influenza and can leave the patient feeling tired. In case of Covid-19, experts say, cough is comparatively milder. “H3N2 mainly causes respiratory illness and starts with high fever, sneezing, dry cough and throat pain. On the other hand, Covid-19 may present symptoms such as bodyache, headache, irritability, lethargy and progress later to mild cough, abdominal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and loss of taste, besides fever and cough,” says Dr Sanjeev Dutta, HOD and senior consultant, Paediatrics at Marengo Asia Hospitals. Eat right to energise A wholesome meal is one that is rich in proteins, healthy fats and a moderate quantity of good carbs, besides good vitamin intake. “Regular intake of vitamin C in the form of one lemon a day and prescribed supplements must be taken throughout the year, not just when one catches an infection,” says nutritionist Tripti Tandon. She also suggests opting for fruits over juice: “A glass of juice is made using two-three fruits, increasing the consumption of natural sugar. That can lead to diabetes, if overdone. On the other hand, if you eat a fruit, even a small quantity is filing and the fibre intake is an added advantage.” Some other must-adds to the diet are coconut water, nuts, legumes and sprouts.

I am looking for ... how to get to Radboudumc News items Higher level of antibodies when influenza vaccine and COVID-19 booster are administered intermittently Listen 13 April 2023 Elderly have more antibodies against COVID-19 when they receive a COVID-19 booster and influenza vaccination subsequently than when they receive them at the same time. This possibly means that concurrent administration of the COVID-19 booster and influenza vaccine provides lower protection against COVID-19, but follow-up studies are necessary to confirm. No additional side effects occur with concurrent administration. Every fall, people over 60 and people in frail health receive an invitation for an influenza vaccination. In recent years, people have also been invited for a COVID-19 booster during this period. In view of a possible resurgence of SARS-CoV-2 in the winter season, the question arose whether concurrent administration of both vaccines is possible, or whether it would be better to have a few weeks in between. Radboud university medical center initiated a study into this. The results of this study showed that people who first received the COVID-19 booster and three weeks later the influenza vaccination produced more antibodies than people who received both vaccinations concurrently. In addition the antibodies of that first group, were able to neutralize the virus better than the antibodies of the people who got them combined. Research leader Mihai Netea, professor of internal medicine at Radboudumc: ‘We see a strong immune response against the coronavirus in both groups. However, the immune response was lower in people who received the vaccines combined. Whether this actually leads to lower protection cannot be determined with certainty. There may be clinical implications. For that, follow-up studies are needed, in which we follow the participants for longer periods of time.’ He does stress that it is an important aspect to take into account in future vaccination campaigns for the elderly: 'The findings of this study underline the need for more research into the effects on the immune system. Now we are talking about a combination of the influenza vaccine and COVID-19 booster, but it also applies to other vaccine combinations.' People who received the COVID-19 booster and influenza vaccine at the same time had no more side effects than those who received them subsequently. Physician-researcher and first author Elisabeth Dulfer: ‘This means that concurrent administration of the vaccines is safe. For policy makers, these results provide important information when planning a new vaccination campaign in the fall.’ About the study design 154 participants aged 60 years and older were given an influenza vaccine and COVID-19 booster at different times and in different sequences. Their blood samples were used to examine how their immune systems responded to these vaccinations. Participants also kept track of how much they suffered from any side effects. The participants were followed up to six weeks after the first vaccination. ZonMw subsidized this research, the TACTIC study. The researchers have offered their results to the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport.

It’s also recently been detected in some mammals, including a pet dog. That’s why scientists in Saskatchewan are trying to get ahead of the virus.H5N1 has killed or infected 7.2M birds since 2021: Canadian Food Inspection AgencyJessie Anton, Sam Samson · CBC News · Posted: Apr 10, 2023 4:00 AM EDT | Last Updated: April 10, 2023Yan Zhou, a senior research scientist and molecular biologist with the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization at the University of Saskatchewan, has researched influenza for 20 years. (Sam Samson/CBC)Social SharingYan Zhou has researched influenza viruses at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization (VIDO) at the University of Saskatchewan for two decades, with nearly half of that time being spent looking into avian flu. She said there's a relatively new strain causing urgent concern: H5N1."We have seen this contemporary H5N1 virus circulating in the world for several years, and now it seems this virus has gained ground in North America," said Zhou, a senior research scientist and molecular biologist.H5N1 has killed or infected 7.2 million birds across the country since Dec. 20, 2021, according to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.In recent months, mammals have also died from the virus, including a dog in southern Ontario.Health Canada has not reported any domestically acquired human cases of avian flu. However, it noted in a statement to CBC News that the federal government "has agreements with several manufacturers to secure priority access and reserve production capacity if needed to rapidly manufacture and deliver large numbers of vaccine doses to help protect people."Presumptive cases of avian flu in skunks, foxes found in Sask.Bird flu keeps spreading beyond birds. Scientists worry it signals a growing threat to humans, too'Trying to prevent the next human pandemic'Alyson Kelvin, a virologist at VIDO whose research team is working with Zhou's on a Canada-wide avian flu vaccine strategy, said the spike in H5N1 cases comes down to bird flyways.Kelvin said that when birds fly south for the winter and north for the summer, the virus migrates over Canada, mixing with viruses from South America, the United States and Central America."Viruses mutate quite rapidly and — even though I don't see the current H5N1 as a human health threat — we know that it can cross over and infect people," she said. "We're not just trying to prevent the next human pandemic, but also a pandemic in our agricultural species."Alyson Kelvin, a virologist with the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization at the University of Saskatchewan, is helping to work on a Canada-wide vaccine strategy that protects both birds and humans from avian flu. (Sam Samson/CBC)Kelvin said her research team is currently building vaccine targets and incorporating previous technologies to develop the most "cutting edge" vaccines.Meanwhile, Zhou's team is researching to evaluate the threat avian flu has on public health."We want to dissect the genes or proteins that are responsible for the virus that can acquire the transmissibility between humans or mammals. After we find those characteristics, we may find a target to prevent the spillover," she said.Together, their end goal is to create a series of vaccines for both humans and animals that protects against avian flu. But given how fast the virus evolves, their biggest challenge is time."Even though the virus is smart, we are smarter," Zhou said with a smile. "We are armed with knowledge and expertise to dissect the virus's characteristics, and then we can change them back … or we can mutate those genes so they are less virulent and do not cause disease."The toll on poultry farmersKelvin said avian flu affects the poultry industry the most right now, putting producers on the front lines.As both a poultry farmer and executive member of Turkey Farmers of Canada, Jelmer Wiersma said he's watched and felt the impact of H5N1.Last fall, he had to cull his flock of around 17,000 turkeys at his farm near Cudworth, Sask., roughly 90 kilometres northeast of Saskatoon."They were sluggish and lethargic — we knew something was going on, so we got them tested. Sure enough, within a few days, we had the results back and they were positive," he said."The devastation is twofold. There's the amount of death and destruction that you're confronted with in the barns, then there's the reality that you have to clean the mess up."Wiersma added that biosecurity — keeping farms as secure and away from wild birds as possible — is key at the farmer level to help avoid avian flu. But he sees vaccines as "the way forward."He said many poultry farmers are eagerly waiting to see how avian flu vaccines take shape, noting that it would be easiest for farmers if they can be sprayed on the birds or ingested.Avian flu returns to Sask. after more than 10 yearsSaskatoon Zoo takes precautions amid avian flu detection in Sask.In the meantime, Wiersma said the Turkey Farmers of Canada is developing a committee of representatives from across the country to help producers deal with avian flu and the mental health toll that often comes with it."It's quite devastating and daunting to have to go through that — I know it was for me," he said."If you don't have any resources to pull from, it would make it that much worse."ABOUT THE AUTHORJessie AntonJournalistJessie Anton is a Regina-based journalist with CBC Saskatchewan.

(xeniaphobia | BigStockPhoto.com)(xeniaphobia | BigStockPhoto.com)Leading animal health companies are already selling vaccines designed to combat the global highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) crisis. They stand ready to address the U.S. market if the need arises. In April 2023, WATT PoultryUSA surveyed leading pharmaceutical companies manufacturing animal health vaccines about their current work on HPAI. These companies were: Boehringer Ingelheim, Ceva, Elanco Animal Health Inc., Merck Animal Health and Zoetis Inc. HPAI, in 2023, is a global issue. In the U.S., Gary Baxter, vice president of U.S. poultry sales and marketing at Ceva Animal Health, said this outbreak is different than the past, 2014-15 experience in the U.S., in that wild birds are primarily spreading the H5N1 disease.“Given the prevalence of the disease in wild bird populations, the industry faces new challenges to the effectiveness of stamp-out strategies to contain HPAI,” Baxter said. Vaccination in the U.S. In the U.S. vaccines need to be approved by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). The USDA is reportedly developing its own vaccines, too. A vaccine rollout would be outlined by the USDA and individual state veterinarians would drive how quickly results would be seen in a region or bird segment. Baxter said vaccination can help reduce clinical outbreaks, mortality and overall economic losses. Vaccines can also reduce viral shedding. A vaccine strategy, he said, would be dependent on how widespread and aggressively the virus is affecting commercial birds. A real life strategy would likely be a regionalized or compartmentalized vaccination of high-risk populations or an emergency vaccination done in response to a severe outbreak to prevent further spread. In the past, the USDA ordered a precautionary HPAI vaccine bank, too. Countries that are vaccinating successfully overseas, Baxter said, are following a differentiating infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA) surveillance strategy. DIVA surveillance helps determine if HPAI is still circulating. “Similar surveillance strategies have been employed for years for other catastrophic poultry diseases, like Newcastle disease, for example,” Baxter said. Mohamad Morsey, executive director of poultry research and development at Merck Animal Health, said his company strongly believes that vaccination, along with a DIVA strategy, can significantly reduce the challenges raised by avian influenza and offer and optimized HPAI control system. “Any use of vaccines for HPAI in the U.S. or globally should be done in conjunction with rigorous surveillance programs which should be established at a government level."Vaccination can help reduce clinical outbreaks, mortality and overall economic losses. (smile23 I Shutterstock.com) HPAI vaccinesA vaccine would work, Baxter said, by presenting a close match to the HA protein of the circulating virus. Research data shows HVT based vector vaccines for HPAI are cross-protective because they induce cell-mediated immunity. New research from Wageningen University & Research in the Netherlands testing three modern HPAI vaccines showed the vector HVT-H5 vaccines from Ceva and Boehringer Ingelheim were 100% effective in preventing disease and mortality after injection with the H5N1 HPAI virus. Viral spread was also prevented. Gary Baxter, Ceva (Courtesy Ceva) Beth Breeding, a spokeswoman for Boehringer Ingelheim Animal Health USA Inc., said the company’s vaccine is not currently licensed for use in the U.S. The company’s vaccines are in use in Latin America, the Middle East and Asia where HPAI vaccinations are permitted.“We are focused on additional research and innovation globally to address HPAI and other animal health challenges facing poultry producers today.”Baxter said Ceva already has numerous avian influenza (AI) vaccines licensed for use in countries around the world. He mentioned Vectormune AI, a vectorized HVT-A5 AI vaccine licensed in the U.S. since 2012. Vector HVT-AI vaccines are currently licensed and distributed in multiple countries in the Middle East, Africa, Southeast Asia, Central and South America, including three countries in Latin America which started importing vector HVT-AI vaccines in 2023. Approved methods of application varies from country to country, but Vectored HVT-AI vaccines have been licensed to be given in ovo or by injection at one day of age. He said other AI vaccines are also under development at Ceva. Morsey said Merck’s current vaccine portfolio includes vaccines for the H5 and H9 strains of HPAI. “At Merck Animal Health we do not disclose our pipeline, but we can share that we have an extensive, ongoing research program that is focused on discovering and developing vaccines that are DIVA and address the holistic issues associated with avian influenza, including clinical efficacy and the prevention of viral shedding,” Morsey said. In a statement, Zoetis said it is monitoring the situation and “stands ready to develop a vaccine based on the current strain if that is the route poultry producers and the USDA want to take.” The company did reach out to the USDA with a vaccine licensing plan based on the current strain of HPAI.Looking aheadSome concerns exist whether a vaccine could work over the long term against a constantly mutating virus. Baxter said as changes in the HPAI clades occur, scientists would constantly perform clinical and field trials to ensure the continued effectiveness of vaccination strategies against field infections. “Ongoing research into new vaccine technologies may also provide future strategies to help control HPAI,” Baxter said. In a statement, Elanco Animal Health said there could be advantages to using vaccines but a “multi-stakeholder evaluation of the possibilities for using vaccines to ensure better protection of poultry at risk of HPAI outbreaks is needed.”“The animal health industry is ready to contribute when the need arises, provided authorities and governments provide clear guidance.”Subscribe to MagazineRecommendedLatest NewsNational Turkey Federation offering 'Thanksgiving 101' tips and recipesLatest NewsHormel Foods honoredRelated StoriesDiseases & HealthAvian influenza vaccination won’t happen in the U.S. yetAvian InfluenzaJapan may consider alternative avian flu control policiesAvian InfluenzaEurope supports Italy’s avian flu-hit poultry farmersAvian InfluenzaKey owners are necessary in biosecurity: supporting teamMore in Diseases & HealthAvian InfluenzaAvian flu confirmed in poultry flocks in 13 European countriesThe H5N5 variant has been confirmed for the first time at a European poultry farm.Brand InsightsVaccination success depends on crew trainingZoetisContinuous evaluation and training are critical to improving pullet vaccination accuracy.Avian Influenza8 more British Columbia flocks struck by avian fluSo far in 2024, the province has had 22 commercial poultry flocks affected by the virus.Avian InfluenzaLatest Canadian HPAI infections involved variety of speciesOne more flock infection has been reported in Abbotsford, British Columbia.Diseases & HealthHow to reduce S. infantis risk in broiler productionThe incidence of Salmonella infantis has been rising in broiler flocks, but producers can take steps to minimize risk.Diseases & HealthAntibiotics leadership has enhanced the poultry industryWorking together, our members have not only gained greater influence but broad recognition.TurkeyHistomonosis transmission insights could improve treatmentThere are currently no approved drugs in the U.S. for the deadly turkey disease.Diseases & HealthNewcastle disease hits two more poultry farms in PolandNearly 60.000 birds among two flocks are lost.Avian InfluenzaHPAI hits 5 flocks in British Columbia, 1 in CaliforniaAPHIS provides additional information concerning two broiler flocks previously reported as confirmed cases.Avian InfluenzaAustralia commits more funds to H5N1 preparednessAustralian authorities add additional funds to surveillance, biosecurity, vaccines and communications in the face of possible H5N1 incursion.Avian InfluenzaAPHIS updates report on California HPAI casesFlock size numbers for two of four affected operations have been disclosed.Avian InfluenzaMore HPAI reported in California, British Columbia poultryBoth the state and the province have confirmed cases in two commercial flocks.Diseases & HealthUSDA approves use of European avian metapneumovirus vaccineThe National Turkey Federation supports import permit to improve treatment of the contagious respiratory disease.Page 1 of 225Next PageNews and analysis for the global poultry industryFollow WATTPoultry.comFacebook iconLinkedIn iconYouTube iconDelete My DataTopicsPoultry MeatEggPoultry HealthSustainabilityPoultry FutureMoreWebinarsBrand InsightsPodcastsWhite PapersWATT Poultry ChatTop Companies Data DownloadsMagazinesSubscribeAdvertiseAbout UsContact UsMedia RequestPrivacy PolicySite Map© 2024 All rights reserved.Dog flu outbreak in OKC: What to know, how to keep your pet safeSkip to main content HomeElection 2024Voter GuidePoliticsEducationHealthReligionUSA TODAY What is dog flu and should Oklahoma pet owners be concerned?Jana Hayes OklahomanShow Caption Hide Caption Can my dog eat this? Fruits, vegetables safe for furry friends.Fruits and vegetables can make a treat that leaves your dog howling in delight, but some of them can be toxic.Cody Godwin, USA TODAYAs a dog flu and strep outbreak takes over the metro area, some animal shelters remain closed and field experts are asking dog owners to use caution until it passes.Here's what we know about the illness and what precautions are being taken.What is the dog flu and how does it spread?Canine influenza, more commonly called dog flu, is a contagious respiratory disease in dogs caused by two Type A "canine influenza viruses," according to the CDC. There have been no reports of human infections with canine influenza.The infection mostly spreads "through respiratory droplets produced during coughing and sneezing from infected dogs, or through contact with contaminated surfaces," according to the CDC.It was considered "a newly emerging pathogen" in the U.S. dog population in 2005, and is believed to have originally spread from horses to dogs.Dr. Erik Eldridge with Edmond's Memorial Road Pet Hospital said his practice began vaccinating for the dog flu for the first time earlier this year "in anticipation of something like this happening," after seeing some cases pop up in Tulsa and Enid. He has now seen a few dogs with flu symptoms and at least one that tested positive, but had never seen any dog flu cases at his clinic before."I think people are, particularly now, grateful that we were kind of ahead of it," Eldridge said.More: Oklahoma City temporarily closing animal shelter after 130 dogs get respiratory infectionWhat symptoms do canines with dog flu have?Dogs that have gotten sick have "common upper respiratory symptoms," including coughing, runny nose, labored breathing and loss of appetite, said Jon Gary, Oklahoma City Animal Welfare superintendent."The dogs who have passed away have had hemorrhaging from the lungs," Gary said.The CDC says most dogs with the flu will recover within a few weeks, but a small percentage see secondary infections and even death."We see a fair amount of kennel cough every year as everybody else does," Eldridge said. "Those dogs will get sick but they don't particularly feel bad. They may cough and have a snotty nose for a few days, but with the flu they quit eating, they get dehydrated, they get pneumonia. So, it's quite a bit more of a severe disease."How to keep your pets safe. A dog died after getting bird flu in Canada.What precautions should dog owners be taking to avoid flu?Teresa Coplen, Midwest City animal welfare manager, said she would caution dog owners against taking their dogs to public places that other dogs frequent.Eldridge said it's important for pet owners to talk to their vet about when it's safe to be around other dogs again. He also said owners should be advocating for their dogs, checking with places like groomers and trainers to see if there have been any sick dogs in the practice."It's like when you go into the doctor's office during the height of COVID," Eldridge said. "Have you had symptoms of this, that or the other thing. Make sure they're asking those questions."Should I get my dog the flu vaccine?Many local veterinarians offer the vaccine, which Eldridge said is a yearly vaccine with a booster shot two to four weeks later.Tristan Young, chief of operations at OKC Vet Campus, said like human flu the dog flu can change from year to year, so a yearly vaccination is necessary. OKC Vet Campus has required the vaccine for boarding at its campus for years, Young said.Young said the vaccine is much more expensive than most, but that it's "incredibly" effective."Mortality is pretty much eliminated," Young said. "(The dog) might have a rough day, but that'd be about it."One current issue, Young said, is that of the two manufacturers of the vaccine, one has been recalled and one is still working on getting new stock to veterinarians. OKC Vet Campus is currently out of the vaccine, but Young said there are others that still have it in supply.Adopt a pet: Oklahoma shelter animals await furever homesOKC, Midwest City animal shelters closed; others limiting intakeOklahoma City's animal shelter was the first among metro shelters to close amid the flu outbreak. The shelter has been closed since March 30 after the illness had spread to 130 dogs in three days.As of May 1, the number of dogs who had died was five, and there was no news on when the shelter would reopen, according to city officials.Moore and Midwest City shelters announced precautions on March 30 and April 3, respectively.After nearly a month-long closure, during which a total of all 35 dogs were sick and five dogs died, the Midwest City animal shelter is open for adoptions only."All of our dogs are healthy," Teresa Coplen, animal welfare manager, said. "They went a week with no symptoms, so we felt it was safe to start adopting them back out."Coplen said they will coordinate restoring intake with other local shelters so that no one shelter is overwhelmed with dogs being brought from across the metro.In Moore, the animal welfare and adoption center won't be taking in strays or pets surrendered by owners until further notice."Officers will still be responding to animals at large in the community, but we are asking the public not to pick up strays and instead call the shelter if you see or find a stray," the shelter said on Facebook.The Norman Animal Welfare shelter hasn't been impacted by the flu, and remains open but is only accepting dogs with proof of Norman residence.More: Crowded OKC animal shelter may close for another week as dogs battle respiratory infectionHow are vet and grooming services impacted by dog flu outbreak?Some area veterinarians have placed restrictions on seeing dogs that have come from the shelter, Gary said.And many vet offices are only seeing dogs displaying symptoms outside the clinic, including Sunset Veterinary Clinic, OKC Vet Campus and Memorial Road Pet Hospital.Young said his clinic went from seeing maybe one to two patients displaying symptoms per week to now twelve to fifteen per week."As soon as the news broke, people start paying attention to the symptoms of things ... and once they knew what bad looked like, they knew to come in," Young said.How to help OKC area animal shelters during dog flu outbreakDonation wishlist for OKC Animal Welfare.Donation wishlist for Midwest City Animal Welfare.

Photo: Edmond So“[The department] has confirmed with various flu vaccine suppliers that there will be a sufficient amount of flu vaccines, which will expire in June or later, for private doctors to order,” it said. “Doctors can contact the suppliers and purchase the flu vaccines based on their needs.”Family doctor Dr Edmund Lam Wing-wo said about 1,200 doctors taking part in the government’s vaccination subsidy scheme had received a department letter that vaccines were available for them to reserve from Tuesday.A day earlier, Lam said three manufacturers – Sanofi, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and Abbott – had agreed to earmark more than 200,000 doses of flu vaccine in total for Hong Kong.AdvertisementHe added that the extra jabs were slated for the current influenza season to reinforce supplies of those used in the vaccination scheme that started last year.AdvertisementChina records first human death from H3N8 bird flu डाउन टू अर्थPrint EditionSubscribeHealthAgricultureWaterWasteClimateAirAfricaData CentreVideoGalleryYoung EnvironmentalistBookshopNewslettersSubscribeHealthAgricultureWaterWasteClimateAirAfricaData CentreVideoGalleryYoung EnvironmentalistBookshopNewsletters HealthChina records first human death from H3N8 bird fluChina alerted;WHO 24 days after the woman was hospitalised &amp; 11 days after her death, against the mandated 24 hoursPhoto: iStockTaran DeolPublished on: 12 Apr 2023, 5:14 amCopiedChina recorded the first human death caused by H3N8, a strain of the avian influenza virus, in the third human case ever recorded globally. The other two human cases were also reported from China in April-May 2022. The patient, a 56-year-old woman from Guangdong province, fell ill on February 22, 2023, was hospitalised with severe pneumonia on March 3 and died on March 16. The World Health Organization (WHO) was notified of this incident on March 27.The National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China alerted the global health body 24 days after the woman was hospitalised and 11 days after her death, against the mandated 24 hours within which countries must report human cases of non-human flu infections under the International Health Regulations. In its disease outbreak update from April 11, the WHO noted “it is still unclear what the exact source of this infection is and how this virus is related to other avian influenza A(H3N8) viruses that are circulating in animals”.No other contacts of this case, or the other two from earlier last year, tested positive for the virus, indicating that the virus does not spread easily among humans. So, national and international level risk remains low. “However, due to the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, WHO stresses the importance of global surveillance to detect virological, epidemiological and clinical changes associated with circulating influenza viruses which may affect human (or animal) health,” the United Nations health agency noted. Of the previous two cases, one patient was critical and the other had a mild illness. Both have since recovered. The latest fatal case was detected through the severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) surveillance system and had a history of live poultry exposure and interaction with live birds around her home before she fell ill. “Environmental samples were collected from the patient's residence and the wet market where the patient spent time before the onset of illness. The results of testing showed that the samples collected from the wet market were positive for influenza A(H3),” said WHO.This strain of avian influenza has commonly been detected in birds from across the world, with even cross-species transmission to some mammals. However, it doesn't jump into humans easily, occurring sporadically and in very specific contexts. Most human infections with avian influenza viruses that have been reported previously were due to exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments, the WHO noted. “Since avian influenza viruses continue to be detected in poultry populations, further sporadic human cases are expected in the future.”Another strain of avian influenza, H5N1, made headlines just last month when an 11-year-old girl died of the infection in Cambodia. Not long before that, the virus was also routinely being found in many mammals including minks, bears, foxes, skunks, possums, racoons and seals. For now, human to human transmission of H5N1 also remains low, much like H3N8. Having said that, more than 800 human cases of this strain have been recorded since the first outbreak in 1997 in Hong Kong. Half of these cases were fatal. However, while the pandemic threat from H5N1 is high, it has not particularly increased over the past 25 years. “It is very difficult to assign a quantitative risk to these viruses. We have some idea of what changes this virus has to make to become more human-adapted, but we don’t have a good feel for how easily the viruses can make these changes,” Richard Webby, director of the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals and Birds, had earlier told Down To Earth.WorldHealthAsiaChinabird fluAvian influenzaH5N1h3n8guangdong provinceShow CommentsRelated StoriesNo stories found.

Wednesday 12 April 2023 09:31, UK Why you can trust Sky News A woman in China has become the first person to die from a type of bird flu that is rare in humans, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has said. The strain does not appear to spread between people. The 56-year-old woman from the southern province of Guangdong was the third person known to have been infected with the H3N8 subtype of avian influenza, according to the WHO. Though rare in people, H3N8 is common in birds, but it causes little to no sign of disease. It has also infected other mammals.It was announced on Tuesday that bird flu measures in the UK will be lifted later this month. Samples collected from a wet market visited by the woman before she became ill were positive for influenza A(H3), said the WHO, suggesting this may have been the source of infection."Based on available information, it appears that this virus does not have the ability to spread easily from person to person, and therefore the risk of it spreading among humans at the national, regional, and international levels is considered to be low," the WHO said in a statement.There were no other cases found among close contacts of the infected woman, it added.All of the cases have been in China, with the first two cases reported last year.

Expert's answers on avian influenzaBy The Conversation2:25pm Apr 13, 2023 Tweet Facebook Mail Avian influenza or "bird flu" is a highly contagious viral infection that affects wild and domestic birds worldwide.It has recently gained notoriety for its devastating impact on the commercial poultry sector and as an emerging human public health threat, particularly after China recorded the first known human death from the H3N8 strain earlier this year.Here are the answers to some common questions about the disease.﻿READ MORE: When should you get your influenza vaccine ahead of flu season?﻿Bird flu is a highly contagious viral infection that affects wild and domestic birds worldwide. (AP)What are avian influenza viruses?Influenza viruses belong to the Orthomyxovirus family and are grouped into four species designated by the letters A (Alpha), B (Beta), C (Gamma) and D (Delta). Almost all influenza infections in humans are caused by influenza A and B viruses.Influenza A viruses have been named avian (bird), swine (pig), equine (horse), canine (dog), chiropteran (bat) and human, based on their natural reservoir (the organism where they are most commonly found).Avian influenza and other Influenza A viruses are categorized into subtypes according to the composition of their hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) surface proteins. There are 18 known H types (H1 to H18) and 11 known N types (N1 to N11). The combination of an H type and an N type defines a specific influenza virus subtype (for example, H5N1).READ MORE: How other nations have moved to tackle housing affordability﻿Bird flu as seen under a microscope. (African CDC)What do we know about avian influenza?Bird flu was first described in the late 1800s. It's a highly transmissible and usually mild disease of wild birds such as geese, swans, seagulls, shorebirds, and also domestic birds such as chickens and turkeys. It is usually caused by influenza A viruses with an H5 or H7 hemaglutinin type, for example, H5N1 or H7N9.While many forms of these viruses are minimally virulent — meaning they cause mild disease — some are highly virulent, meaning that they cause more serious disease. Millions of poultry deaths in Asia, Europe, the Americas and Australia have been attributed to highly virulent forms of H5N1, H5N8, H7N7 and H7N9, with H5N1 accounting for the vast majority of cases.In Canada and the US, outbreaks of H5N1 influenza in domestic and wild birds have been reported in most regions.READ MORE: Why is there a push to stop using gas stoves in Australian homes?﻿How is avian influenza transmitted to humans?Avian influenza viruses are not easily transmitted from birds to humans or to other animals. Humans are accidental hosts — meaning that the virus does not typically circulate among people.Humans may acquire the virus after inhaling birds' respiratory droplets or exposure of their mucus membranes to bird feces, saliva or contaminated surfaces.Bird flu cannot be transmitted by eating cooked poultry products.Recently discovered mutations in the neuraminidase (N) gene of H5N1 viruses isolated from humans appear to promote bird-to-human transmission. Fortunately, human-to-human transmission is extremely rare.EXPLAINED: Who can get a COVID-19 booster dose?﻿Bird flu is a highly transmissible and usually mild disease of wild birds such as geese, swans, seagulls, shorebirds, and also domestic birds such as chickens and turkeys. (AP)When was avian influenza first reported in humans?The first human cases of avian influenza were reported in 1997 by public health authorities in Hong Kong. These infections were linked to poultry infected with a highly virulent H5N1 subtype. Of the 18 affected individuals, six (33 per cent) succumbed to their illness.Since then, avian influenza has been responsible for at least 2,600 infections and over 1000 deaths in humans worldwide. In the majority of human cases, infection was acquired following exposure to live poultry rather than wild birds.Human infections due to avian influenza viruses have primarily been caused by subtypes H5N1, H5N6, H7N7 and H7N9. All but two of the documented human fatalities to date have occurred in low-to-middle-income countries, likely as a consequence of the total case burden and lack of access to antiviral drugs.READ MORE: What is strep A, the deadly disease that has authorities on alert?Cambodia health experts spray disinfectant at a village in Prey Veng where a girl caught bird flu. (AP)What are the signs and symptoms of avian influenza in humans? How is it diagnosed?Early symptoms of avian influenza in humans are similar to those caused by seasonal influenza viruses such as H3N2 and H1N1. Typical symptoms include fevers, chills, muscle aches, cough, sore throat, shortness of breath, headache and fatigue.Infections caused by highly virulent forms of H5N1 or H7N9 subtypes may follow a more severe course of illness characterised by internal bleeding, multi-organ failure and a high mortality rate.The combination of an influenza-like illness and a recent history of exposure to live poultry should raise suspicion for avian influenza. The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of viral RNA in nasopharyngeal specimens using tests for specific subtypes.READ MORE: 'Priority groups' urged to get free flu vaccine in NSW﻿What treatments are available for avian influenza?Antiviral drugs belonging to the neuraminidase inhibitor (such as oseltamivir) and endonuclease inhibitor classes (for example, baloxivir) appear to be highly effective against most avian influenza subtypes, including H5N1 and H7N9.However, antiviral resistance has been well documented and represents a threat to the potency of these agents in the face of constant viral evolution.READ MORE: A deadly fungus is spreading in the US. Here's what you need to know﻿Early symptoms of avian influenza in humans are similar to those caused by seasonal flu.Is there a human vaccine against avian influenza?Licensed vaccines exist to protect humans against avian influenza, although they are not commercially available.In 2007, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved an H5N1 vaccine for adults ages 18 and older. These vaccines form part of the US government's Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) of medicines for deployment in the event of a public health emergency.In 2013, the FDA approved a second H5N1 vaccine that is also part of the SNS.Similar vaccines are licensed in other jurisdictions. All of these vaccines were shown to be safe and effective at the time of approval.Answers to the most commonly Googled questions about COVID-19View GalleryIn contrast, H5N1 vaccines for use in animals are commercially available. Vaccination of poultry has been widely adopted in China and other low-to-middle income countries.The US and Europe are gearing up for a massive poultry vaccination campaign to curtail the spread of bird flu.How else can I protect myself against avian influenza?Avoiding direct contact with live poultry is perhaps the single most effective measure to prevent the development of avian influenza.If exposure to potentially infected birds cannot be avoided, personal protective gear including gloves, gowns, face masks and eye shields should be worn.

(Nine)Are bird feeders safe to use?Although there is currently a negligible risk of developing avian influenza following wild bird exposure, there are divergent opinions on the role of bird feeders in potentially spreading the disease.The British Columbia Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals recommends temporarily abandoning the practice of using backyard bird feeders.In contrast, the US Department of Agriculture does not recommend against their use unless poultry are being farmed in the area.Sign up here to receive our daily newsletters and breaking news alerts, sent straight to your inbox.Is avian influenza the next viral pandemic?There is no way to predict if avian influenza will evolve into a pandemic affecting humans.Mitigation strategies to prevent cross-species transmission include large-scale pre-emptive vaccination of domestic birds and culling of infected flocks.Of major concern is the potential for novel avian influenza subtypes to emerge through antigenic shift.This phenomenon involves the reassortment of hemaglutinin and neuraminidase genes when a single host is infected with more than one viral subtype.As such, avian influenza is a prime contender as a pandemic viral disease of animals and humans alike.Current stockpiles of avian influenza vaccines for human use will likely be inadequate to meet societal needs should there be a surge in human infections over time.This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

(cottonbro studio / pexels.com) Share Influenza levels have increased slightly across Canada in recent weeks – notable less for the overall numbers and more for the fact that they’re driven entirely by a rise in influenza B cases, according to Canada’s FluWatch. The report, which comes out weekly and tracks confirmed influenza cases across the country, stated that in Week 13 of 2023, a total of 510 laboratory detections of influenza was noted across the country, numbers that aren’t out of the ordinary for this time of year. Of these confirmed flu cases, 364 were due to influenza B and 146 were due to influenza A. Read more about the different viruses from Health Canada. This means influenza B is currently making up 71 per cent of detections — a change from influenza A’s dominance in 2022. The percentage of tests that came back positive for influenza was 2.4 in Week 13, up from 0.8 per cent in Week 7, an increase solely due to the bump in influenza B, according to the latest FluWatch. The strain is circulating at much higher levels currently than it was last year. During the height of flu season at the end of 2022, the vast majority of cases were due to influenza A, with influenza B barely making a dent. And in March-April of last year, there were only four cases of influenza B across five weeks of flu surveillance, compared to 1,283 cases of influenza A. There were 15 pediatric hospitalizations related to influenza in Week 13, 14 of which were due to influenza B. The overall levels of influenza being seen right now, including all strains, are typical for interseasonal levels, meaning the level which is expected in between flu seasons. In Week 13, around one per cent of visits to health-care professionals were due to “influenza-like illness,” according to the latest FluWatch, which is “slightly below expected levels for this time of year.” More than 9,500 participants reported their health levels to FluWatchers in Week 13 to give an indication of the prevalence of certain respiratory symptoms within the populace, regardless of confirmed flu status or not. Out of this sample, 1.5 per cent reported cough and fever, a percentage that is below seasonal levels. Since Aug. 22 and up to April 1, there have been 67,806 influenza detections, 97 per cent of which have been influenza A. In the same time period, there has also been 4,008 influenza-associated hospitalizations reported by participating provinces and territories. Of these, 99 per cent were influenza A cases.

The Standard Channel IOS Android IOS Android More>> However, he said health authorities had been in contact with the manufacturer to ensure there was a sufficient supply of the drug. Roche, the Swiss manufacturer of Tamiflu, also promised earlier it would ship in extra supplies of the drug, with an urgent delivery scheduled for the end of May.Meanwhile, William Chui Chun-ming, President of the Society of Hospital Pharmacists, said those who caught the flu might not necessarily require Tamiflu, which people should leave the drugs to those in urgent need.
