Reporting of preliminary in-season burden estimates for the 2024-2025 season will begin again in fall 2024. Background and Preliminary Estimates This web page provides weekly, preliminary estimates of the cumulative in-season numbers of flu illnesses, medical visits, hospitalizations, and deaths in the United States. It is not possible to know the exact number of people who have experienced flu illness in the United States because not everyone who gets sick with flu will seek medical care or be tested for influenza. Given this, not all flu illnesses will be identified through our surveillance systems. This is why we use mathematical models to estimate the impact of flu on the population. When sharing in-season estimates of flu disease burden, CDC believes that using a range is a better way to represent the variability of flu. These real-time burden estimates use surveillance data from patients hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed flu in geographically distributed areas in the United States, which may fluctuate week to week during the season. CDC has estimated the burden of flu since 2010 using a mathematical model that is based on data collected through the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET), a network that covers approximately 9% of the U.S. population. Preliminary 2023–2024 U.S. Flu In-Season Disease Burden Estimates Since, from October 1, 2023, CDC estimates there have been between: Based on data from October 1, 2023, through April 30, 2024 Since, from October 1, 2023, CDC estimates there have been between: 34 – 75 million flu illnesses 15 – 33 million flu medical visits 380,000 – 900,000 flu hospitalizations 17,000 – 100,000 flu deaths have occurred during the 2023-2024 season. Based on data from October 1, 2023, through April 30, 2024 Because influenza surveillance does not capture all cases of flu, CDC provides these estimated ranges to better reflect the full burden of flu in the United States. These estimates are calculated using a mathematical model based on CDC's weekly influenza surveillance data and are preliminary and are updated weekly throughout the season. Show Text Description Each week CDC calculates a lower estimate and an upper estimate of flu-related hospitalizations that have occurred since the beginning of the season (October 1, 2023). These are compared to end-of-season estimates of flu-related hospitalizations from previous flu seasons. These calculations allow for a preliminary comparison of how in-season flu-related hospitalizations are tracking in relation to past seasons. This can help health officials to continue to manage impacts on health care systems and promote prevention measures. U.S. Flu In-Season Disease Burden Estimates‎ This chart will not be updated again for the 2023-2024 season and will go live once reporting of estimates start for the 2024-2025 season. The plot was last updated with the in-season data runs. The numbers at the top currently reflect our first estimate of the end-of-season burden. Additionally, CDC assesses the current season's severity each week compared to past seasons' and provides information about this season's severity assessment. Keep Reading: 2023-2024 United States Flu Season: Preliminary In-Season Severity Assessment Limitations The estimates of the preliminary, cumulative burden of seasonal influenza are subject to several limitations: The cumulative rate of lab-confirmed flu-related hospitalizations reported during the season may be an underestimate of the rate at the end of the season because of identification and reporting delays. Rates of lab-confirmed flu-related hospitalizations are adjusted for the frequency of flu testing and the sensitivity of flu diagnostic assays. However, data on testing practices during the current flu season are not available in real-time. To make these estimates, CDC uses data on testing practices from the past flu seasons as a proxy. If more testing is being done compared to past flu seasons, these estimates may be inflated. Preliminary in-season burden estimates are finalized when data on contemporary testing practices become available, and the estimates may decrease if testing has increased. Estimates of medical visits for flu-like illnesses are based on data from prior seasons, which may not be accurate if the severity of illness or patterns of health behavior have changed. More Information Interpreting the cumulative burden of flu The cumulative burden of flu is an estimate of the number of people who have been sick, seen a health care provider for, been hospitalized with, or died as a result of flu within a certain timeframe. The in-season preliminary burden estimates are provided weekly during flu season when sufficient data are available to make an estimate, and end-of-season preliminary estimates are given after the end of each flu season. End-of-season preliminary estimates will be updated year-to-year and are considered final when all data for that season are available (usually within two years of the preliminary estimate). How CDC estimates the cumulative burden of seasonal flu Preliminary estimates of the cumulative burden of seasonal flu are based on crude rates of lab-confirmed flu-related hospitalizations, reported through the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET), which are adjusted for the frequency of flu testing during recent prior seasons and the sensitivity of flu diagnostic tests. Rates of hospitalization are then multiplied by the previously estimated ratio of hospitalizations to symptomatic illnesses, and the frequency of patients seeking medical care to calculate symptomatic illnesses, medical visits, hospitalizations, and deaths associated with seasonal flu, respectively. Keep Reading: How CDC Estimates the Burden of Seasonal Influenza in the U.S.Preliminary, in-season estimates of flu burden change each week The in-season estimates of flu burden are preliminary and change week-by-week as new flu hospitalizations are reported to CDC. New reports include both new admissions that have occurred during the reporting week and also patients admitted in previous weeks that have been newly reported to CDC. Comparing the number of flu hospitalizations estimated so far this season with previous end-of-season hospitalization estimates The estimates on this page are preliminary, cumulative and will increase as the season progresses. Past end-of-season estimates of flu-related hospitalizations (2010-2023) have ranged from 100,000-710,000.

Here, we show that intranasal administration of probiotic Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 activates innate immunity in the respiratory tract and provides immediate protection against influenza virus infection within 1 day. Based on this vehicle, a recombinant strain is engineered to express and secret five tandem repeats of the extracellular domain of matrix protein 2 from different influenza virus subtypes. Intranasal vaccination with this strain induces durable humoral and mucosal responses in the respiratory tract, and provides broad protection against the lethal challenge of divergent influenza viruses in female BALB/c mice. Our findings highlight a promising delivery platform for developing mucosal vaccines that provide immediate and sustained protection against respiratory pathogens.

Vaccination is one of the most effective public health interventions to combat influenza2. However, current seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine only protects against a narrow range of virus strains3. There is an urgent need for “universal” influenza vaccines that provide comprehensive protection against influenza viruses4,5. In addition, current vaccines require multiple doses to achieve full efficacy and take time to activate the host immunity3, so a vaccine that provides immediate protection at the onset of an epidemic is needed.Efforts to develop universal influenza vaccines have included experimental vaccines that specifically target the extracellular domain of matrix protein 2 (M2e)6,7, neuraminidase (NA)8,9, or antigenically conserved epitopes on the hemagglutinin (HA) head and stalk10,11. Among these targets, the M2e antigen is remarkably conserved in influenza A virus6. The M2e-specific antibodies protect against infection through both Fc receptor (FcR)-mediated antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC)12. Therefore, M2e has been employed as an ideal target for the development of universal influenza A vaccines by fusing with flagellum protein13, hepatitis B virus core (HBc)14, a specific dendritic cell subset7 or nanoparticle cores15.To combat emerging threats from respiratory pathogens, vaccines that can elicit both mucosal and innate immunity are urgently needed16,17. Compared to intramuscular vaccines, nasally administered vaccines have the advantage of inducing local mucosal immune responses that can block infection and transmission of respiratory pathogens18,19. In the last decade, there has been increasing interest in the use of live bacterial vehicles for antigen delivery to local mucosal tissues20 because the lipopolysaccharides in Gram-negative bacteria or lipoteichoic acid in Gram-positive bacteria could be recognized by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), leading to non-specific activation of the innate immune response in the respiratory tract to form an immediate and broad-spectrum protective barrier against pathogens21,22. However, bacterial surface modules would elicit different immune responses22, suggesting that the bacterium used as a mucosal delivery vehicle should be carefully tested. Regardless, these innate immune responses and their capacity to deliver antigens to activate the adaptive immune system make living microorganisms as potent vehicles for stimulating both immediate and long-term protection against respiratory pathogens.Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN), a genetically tractable probiotic with well-established safety in humans, is emerging as a favored chassis for the treatment of immune-related and metabolic diseases in mouse models and clinical trials23,24,25,26,27. Importantly, EcNs immunomodulatory properties, particularly its ability to modulate chemokine expression via its K5 capsule, suggest its potential as an effective agent for enhancing host immune defenses28,29. Nonetheless, the application of EcN as a mucosal vaccine delivery vehicle warrants empirical validation.In this study, we demonstrated that intranasal administration of EcN effectively activated lung innate immune responses and conferred immediate protection against influenza virus infection in female BALB/c mice. Based on these findings, we engineered EcN to secrete five tandem repeats of the M2e antigen from different influenza virus subtypes and found that intranasal vaccination with EcN-5M2e provided effective cross protection against the lethal challenge of divergent influenza A viruses. These findings endorse EcN as a promising platform for the development of mucosal vaccines that offer both immediate and enduring protection against respiratory pathogens.ResultsIntranasal administration of EcN activates innate immunity to protect against influenza virus infectionTo evaluate the potential of using the probiotic EcN as a vehicle for the development of a vaccine against the respiratory pathogens, we first examined the distribution of EcN in mice by intranasal administration. While the majority of bacteria were observed in the gastrointestinal tract, relative high level of EcN was also observed in lung tissue for a short time (<12 h) (Fig. 1a, b), and decreasing amount of EcN was detected in lung tissue within 2 weeks (Fig. 1c). We then examined the potential of EcN to cause infection by intranasal administration and monitored the mice for 14 days after EcN exposure (Fig. 1d). Although a slight decrease in body weight was observed in the EcN group 1–2 days after administration, no systematic infection was evident based on routine blood tests (Fig. 1e, f). Some inflammatory cell infiltration was observed in the lung 1 and 3 days after treatment with PBS or EcN, but this inflammation was disappeared by day 7 (Supplementary Fig. 1a). Importantly, these responses were restricted to the lung, as no EcN was detected in the heart, liver, spleen or kidney (Fig. 1a; Supplementary Fig. 1b).Fig. 1: In vivo evaluation of EcN for locoregional cytokine responses after intranasal administration.a Representative in vivo IVIS images showing mCherry-labeled EcN (EcN-mCherry, 1 × 108 CFU/10 μL) distribution in key organs post-intranasal delivery at specific times.

PBS represents the control group and EcN represents the group treated with wild-type EcN strain. e The body weight of mice was monitored for 7 days after intranasal administration with EcN (n = 5/group). This experiment was repeated twice independently. f Hemogram indices of the treated mice at the indicated time points (Day1: PBS n = 8, EcN n = 8; Day3: PBS n = 10, EcN n = 10; Day7: PBS n = 7, EcN n = 8; Day14: PBS n = 6, EcN n = 6). g Lung cytokine levels in PBS vs. EcN-treated mice over 1, 3, 7, and 14 days (Day1: PBS n = 3, EcN n = 5; Day3, Day7 and Day14: PBS n = 4, EcN n = 4). Data are presented as mean ± SEM. Statistical significance was analyzed by two-tailed unpaired t-test. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageConsidering that colonization of microorganisms in the lung can activate the local immune system30, we analyzed cytokine changes in the lung 1, 3, 7 and 14 days after EcN exposure. EcN-treated mice showed increased expression of anti-infection interferons (IFN-α, IFN-β and IFN-γ) in lung tissue after 1, 3, 7 and 14 days compared to PBS-treated mice (Fig. 1g). Furthermore, pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-12, and IL-18) and various chemokines (e.g. CCL2 and CCL5) were all upregulated in the lungs of EcN-treated mice (Fig. 1g; Supplementary Fig. 2).After confirming the EcN-induced activation of key antiviral innate responses in lung tissue, we examined the protective effect against influenza virus infection (Fig. 2a). Mice were pre-administered with EcN and the next day infected with 3 × LD50 of PR8 (H1N1) influenza virus (Fig. 2a). Although the body weight of the EcN-treated group initially decreased slightly, it gradually recovered over the following days (Fig. 2b). Notably, all mice in the EcN group survived, whereas all mice in the PBS group died (Fig. 2c). We next investigated whether EcN can protect against influenza virus infection after longer periods of administration. At 3, 7 and 14 days after pretreatment with EcN, we monitored morbidity and mortality in mice treated with PR8 influenza virus (Fig. 2a). Protection rates remained at 100%, 75% and 30% in the 3 day, 7 day and 14 day EcN groups, respectively (Fig. 2b, c), which correlated with the levels of antiviral cytokines observed in lung tissue (Fig. 1g). Taken together, these data highlight the ability of intranasal administration of EcN to activate innate immunity in the respiratory tract and provide immediate protection against influenza virus infection.Fig. 2: Intranasal administration of EcN protects against influenza A virus in BALB/c mice.a Schematic representation of the experimental procedure for infection with A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) after intranasal treatment with EcN or PBS (D1 group: PBS n = 8, EcN n = 8; D3 group: PBS n = 6, EcN n = 6; D7 group: PBS n = 6, EcN n = 8; D14 group: PBS n = 6, EcN n = 10). Weight loss (b) and survival (c) were monitored for 14 days. Data are presented as mean ± SEM. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageRational design of EcN-based universal influenza vaccine EcN-5M2eHaving confirmed that EcN activates innate immunity to protect against influenza virus infection, we next aim to develop a universal influenza vaccine based on EcN. We focused on expressing the conserved M2e antigen in EcN to stimulate adaptive immunity. To identify the representative M2e fragments, we performed a phylogenetic analysis of M2e from homo-derived influenza A viruses. Fragments were selected that represent different branches of evolution and correspond to subtypes that have caused pandemic infections or pose a potential risk of transmission31 (Fig. 3a). To increase the immunogenicity of the M2e fragment as previously reported6,32,33, the M2e sequences from H1N1, H2N2, H3N2, H5N1 and H7N9 were concatenated to form the 5M2e antigen (Fig. 3b). The natural cysteines in M2e (C17 and C19) were replaced with serine to prevent the formation of disulfide bonds that can lead to protein aggregation. This 5M2e protein was well expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) and successfully recognized by the M2e-specific 14C2 antibody (Supplementary Fig. 3). Immunization with the 5M2e protein generated IgG antibodies that specifically recognized the M2e peptide of H1N1, H2N2, H3N2, H5N1 or H7N9, which were incorporated into the design of 5M2e (Fig. 3c). Importantly, the antibodies induced by the 5M2e antigen showed broad-spectrum recognition ability as they recognized M2e peptides outside the design (H6N6, H9N2, H13N2, H17N10 and H18N11) (Fig. 3c).Fig. 3: Characterization of the vaccine strain EcN-5M2e.a Phylogenetic tree for M2e peptides of human-infecting influenza A viruses created using iqtree. b Cartoon model of the 5M2e design and the sequences of M2e from different influenza A virus strains. c Immunogenicity analysis of 5M2e protein. Purified 5M2e protein (10 μg, plus aluminum adjuvant) was immunized subcutaneously three times at 2 weeks intervals (primer-boost-boost). The endpoint titer of IgG to different M2e peptides in serum 1 week after each immunization was determined by ELISA (n = 3/group). Data are presented as mean ± SEM. Statistical significance was analyzed by two-tailed unpaired t-test. d Schematic illustration of the structure of the manipulated probiotic EcN-5M2e vaccine. e Western blot analysis of extracellular 5M2e protein by anti-His or M2e-specific monoclonal 14C2 antibodies. The experiment was repeated three times independently with similar results. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageAn important concern in the development of probiotics is to avoid the use of antibiotic resistance genes in order to meet the requirements for their application in the medical and food industries34. To this end, we used a complementary diaminopimelic acid (dap) plasmid system to express 5M2e without an antibiotic resistance gene in EcN. We first constructed an EcN strain (EcNΔdapB) with a deletion of the dapB gene, which prevents the biosynthesis of the important cell wall component diaminopimelic acid and potentially impairs survival in a mammalian host environment since dap is not produced by eukaryotes35. We then generated a plasmid named pKT-5M2e-HlyABD (Supplementary Fig. 4a) to express DapB and secret 5M2e using the hemolysin A secretion system. This plasmid was then transformed into EcNΔdapB, resulting in the development of the vaccine strain EcN-5M2e (Fig. 3d). In this system, a complementary dapB gene was inserted into pKT-5M2e-HlyABD to enable growth of the EcNΔdapB strain (Supplementary Fig. 4b). Secreted 5M2e protein in the culture supernatant was detected for the EcN-5M2e strain using both His-tag and 14C2 monoclonal antibodies (Fig. 3e). Furthermore, the EcN-5M2e strain showed stable proliferation and passage (Supplementary Fig. 4c), suggesting its suitability for vaccine evaluation.Intranasal immunization with EcN-5M2e elicits effective humoral, mucosal and T cell responsesTo evaluate the immunogenicity of EcN-5M2e, mice were immunized three times intranasally with 108 CFU of EcN-5M2e, EcN-vec, or PBS, and serum samples were collected 7 days after each immunization for further analysis (Fig. 4a). After the 1st and 2nd boosts, the EcN-5M2e triggered a significant increase in M2e-specific IgG antibodies as tested by H1N1-specific M2e peptide (Fig. 4b). Importantly, EcN-5M2e immune sera can bind to the M2 protein expressed by influenza virus-infected cells (Supplementary Fig. 5), suggesting the possible contribution of these sera in virus clearance by promoting ADCC12. Compared to the other groups, the mice immunized intranasally with EcN-5M2e showed significantly higher titers of M2e-specific IgG1 and IgG2a after the 2nd booster vaccination, indicating the induction of both Th1-type and Th2-type immune responses in vivo (Fig. 4c, d).Fig. 4: Antigen-specific systemic immune responses and mucosal immune responses of EcN-5M2e-vaccinated mice.a Schematic illustration of immunization and sampling in the mouse model. Mice were immunized intranasally with EcN-vec, EcN-5M2e, or PBS control. b Endpoint titers of IgG against H1N1-M2e peptide in serum samples collected one week after primer, the 1st or 2nd booster vaccination as determined by ELISA (n = 10/group). c, d Endpoint titers of IgG1 (c) and IgG2a (d) against H1N1-M2e peptide.

Serum samples were diluted 10-fold in this test. h Percentages of M2e-specific CD4+ T cells producing IFN-γ or IL-2 (n = 5/group). i Percentages of M2e-specific CD8+ T cells producing IFN-γ or IL-2 (n = 5/group).

Data are presented as mean ± SEM. Statistical significance was analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test (panels b–i) or two-tailed unpaired t-test (panels j, k). Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageGiven that the mucosal surfaces of the respiratory tract serve as major entry points for influenza viruses36, the production of both mucosal IgG and IgA is conducive to effective protection. We next focused on the immune responses that EcN-5M2e elicits in mucosa tissues. Lavage fluids were collected 2 weeks after the 2nd boost. Intranasal immunization with EcN-5M2e resulted in significant H1N1-M2e-specific mucosal IgA responses in nasal lavage fluid (NALF), bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and serum samples (Fig. 4e–g). In addition, mucosal IgA was also detected in the intestinal lavage fluid (ILF) (Supplementary Fig. 6a), which is in consistent with the distribution of EcN-5M2e in the intestine. Additionally, IgG was also detected in NALF, BALF and ILF (Supplementary Fig. 6b–d).We also examined the M2e-specific T cell response induced by EcN-5M2e. Compared to EcN-vec, immunization with EcN-5M2e could significantly increase the induction of IFN-γ and IL-2 producing CD4+ T cells, but not CD8+ T cells (Fig. 4h, i; Supplementary Fig. 7). Overall, these results demonstrate that EcN-5M2e can induce M2e-specific humoral, mucosal and CD4+ T cell immune responses.We next tested the cross-subtype reactivity of humoral and mucosal antibodies elicited by EcN-5M2e. All tested IgG or IgA antibodies of NALF, BALF or serum IgA showed similar affinity to the different subtypes of M2e peptides included in the 5M2e design (H2N2, H3N2, H5N1 and H7N9) or outside the design (H6N6, H9N2, H13N2, H17N10 and H18N11) (Fig. 4j, k). These results suggest that our EcN-5M2e vaccine has the potential to induce an effective cross-reactive immune response against a broad spectrum of influenza A viruses.EcN-5M2e vaccination protects mice against a broad spectrum of influenza A virusesTo evaluate the protection of EcN-5M2e against influenza virus infection, immunized mice were challenged with H1N1, H3N2, or H6N6, whose M2e sequence was not included in our 5M2e design (Fig. 5a), and monitored for 14 consecutive days. Influenza virus infection caused significant weight loss during the first 9 days in mice treated with PBS or immunized with EcN-vec (Fig. 5b–d). In contrast, mice vaccinated with EcN-5M2e showed a weight loss of <10% after H1N1 or H3N2 infection and <15% after H6N6 infection on days 5–8, with gradual weight recovery in the following days (Fig. 5b–d). All mice in the PBS group succumbed to the infection before 10 days post-challenge. Conversely, all mice in the EcN-5M2e group survived after influenza virus challenge (Fig. 5e–g). The effective protection provided by EcN-5M2e against the phylogenetically distant H6N6 strain demonstrates that the EcN-5M2e vaccine provides broad protection against influenza A viruses.Fig. 5: Protective effect of EcN-5M2e in the mouse model.a Schematic illustration of immunization, sampling and influenza A virus challenge in the mouse model.

After challenging with H1N1, H3N2, or H6N6 viruses, BALFs were collected to measure virus titers at 3 or 5 days post infection (dpi). In contrast to the PBS group, mice vaccinated with EcN-5M2e showed a significant reduction in virus titers (Fig. 5h; Supplementary Fig. 8). Next, we performed pathological examinations of lung tissue infected with H1N1 or H3N2. Lung sections from mice immunized with PBS and EcN-vec displayed typical clinical symptoms affecting more than 50% of the lung parenchyma characterized by multifocal, moderate to severe necrotizing bronchitis and bronchiolitis, and moderate to severe alveolitis with a neutrophil-dominant, mixed inflammatory cell infiltrates and pulmonary edema. In contrast, mice immunized with EcN-5M2e did not show typical clinical symptoms (Fig. 5i, j; Supplementary Fig. 9). Collectively, these data suggest that EcN-5M2e effectively suppresses the infection of homologous (H1N1 and H3N2) and heterologous H6N6 viruses in vivo.The protection of EcN-5M2e involves antibodies, cytokines and T cell responsesTo test the protective capacity of antibodies induced by EcN-5M2e vaccination, we performed an adoptive transfer experiment. Mice were vaccinated with three doses of EcN-5M2e or controls and their sera were collected by terminal blood collection. These sera were then transferred into naïve mice by intraperitoneal administration (Fig. 6a). The IgG titers of recipients (18 h after serum transfer) were similar to those of donors (Fig. 6b), indicating successful acquisition of 5M2e antibodies. Mice were then infected with 5× LD50 of H1N1 virus 24 h after serum transfer and monitored for 14 days to assess morbidity and mortality (Fig. 6a). Mice receiving sera from donors vaccinated with EcN-vec or PBS showed severe morbidity and were not protected (Fig. 6c, d). Although body weight loss was observed in mice that received serum from the EcN-5M2e vaccinated group, about 40% of mice survived (Fig. 6c, d). These results suggest that serum antibodies induced by EcN-5M2e play a role in controlling viral infection, but are not sufficient for complete protection.Fig. 6: The underlying protective mechanism of the EcN-5M2e vaccine.a Schematic illustration of immunization, sampling, and influenza A virus challenge in serum transfer assays. Sera from sequentially vaccinated female BALB/c mice were transferred into naïve BALB/c mice, which were then infected with 3 × LD50 of H1N1 virus. b ELISA was performed to measure endpoint titers of M2e-specific IgG in donors and recipients 18 h after transfer (n = 7/group). c Body weight of mice after a lethal dose of challenge with H1N1 (n = 7/group). d Survival of mice after a lethal dose of challenge with H1N1. e Schematic illustration of immunization, sampling and influenza A virus challenge in the mouse model. f, g Mucosal IgA levels of BALF (f) (n = 5/group) and serum (g) (n = 5/group) samples collected from vaccinated mice infected with H1N1 at 3 or 5 dpi.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageThe limited effect of serum M2e-specific IgG in protecting against influenza virus infection suggests that mucosal immune IgA may play an important role. In addition to M2e-specific IgA stimulation, we also tested whether the EcN-based vaccine could induce general host IgA responses against influenza virus infection. We first treated mice with PBS, EcN-vec, or EcN-5M2e, and then infected them with H1N1 (Fig. 6e). Although neither EcN-vec nor EcN-5M2e expresses HA protein, HA-specific IgA levels were higher in the BAFL of H1N1-infected mice at 3 or 5 dpi in these two groups (Fig. 6f). Serum IgA levels in these groups were similar at 3 and 5 dpi (Fig. 6g). These results suggest that vaccination with EcN-vec or EcN-5M2e facilitates host IgA responses to influenza virus infection.Influenza virus infection can induce significant increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines, which would lead to a cytokine storm and subsequent organ damage, including lung infections, edema, and respiratory complications37. To examine the release of representative cytokines in the lung during viral infection, we collected BALF samples from mice infected with H1N1 or H3N2 viruses at 3 or 5 dpi. After 3 days of H1N1 exposure, we observed three different patterns of cytokine responses (Fig. 6h). Typically, EcN-5M2e treatment resulted in higher levels of IFN-γ (type II interferon) and IL-10 (a negative regulator of the inflammatory response) production (Fig. 6i; Supplementary Fig. 10a), which is in consistent with previous reports that IFN-γ and IL-10 play key roles in the control of influenza virus infection38,39. The levels of chemotactic cytokines, including GM-CSF, MCP-1 (CCL2), RENTES (CCL5), and KC (CXCL1), were significantly decreased in both EcN-5M2e and EcN-vec groups (Fig. 6j; Supplementary Fig. 10a), suggesting a possible role of these chemotactic cytokines in regulating infection. Type I interferons (IFN-α and IFN-β) as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-12p70 and IL-6) were all decreased in the 5M2e group (Fig. 6k; Supplementary Fig. 10a), which correlate with virus titer and lung pathology (Fig. 5h, i). These results were further confirmed in mice exposed to H3N2 (Supplementary Fig. 10b). Taken together, these data suggest that cytokines regulated by EcN-5M2e may contribute to infection control.To elucidate the role of M2e-specific CD4+ T cells induced by EcN-5M2e in combating influenza virus, we depleted CD4+ T cells from EcN-5M2e immunized mice by injection of anti-CD4 antibody (Fig. 7a). As expected, the frequency of residual CD4+ T cells in spleen and lung was <1% in the depleted group compared with others (Fig.7b, c). When challenged with 10 × LD50 of H1N1 virus, CD4+ T cell-depleted mice exhibited greater weight loss over immunized groups without depletion or injected with isotype antibody, but retained partial protection (Fig. 7d, e). These results suggest that EcN-5M2e confers immune protection against influenza infection, at least in part, through CD4+ T cell responses.Fig. 7: Correlates to immune protection after CD4+ T cell depletion in BALB/c mice.a Schematic illustration of CD4+ T cell depletion in EcN-5M2e immunization, sampling and influenza A virus challenge in the mouse model. At 2 weeks after the second boost immunization, EcN-5M2e immunized mice were injected intraperitoneally with anti-mouse CD4 monoclonal antibody (anti-CD4) or rat IgG2a isotype control (ck) on day -3, -2, -1 and 2. On day 0, spleens and lungs were harvested and analyzed by flow cytometry to determine the efficiency of CD4+ T cell depletion. b FCM assessment of the frequency of CD4+ T cells. c Quantification of CD4+ T cells in different groups. Each dot represents one mouse (PBS: n = 5; EcN-5M2e: n = 5; EcN-5M2e+anti-CD4: n = 4; EcN-5M2e+ck: n = 3). Statistical significance was analyzed by two-tailed unpaired t-test. d, e Body weight changes (d) and survival rates (e) of EcN-5M2e-immunized mice after challenged with 10 × LD50 H1N1 influenza viruses in CD4+ T cell depletion assay (PBS: n = 6; EcN-5M2e, EcN-5M2e + anti-CD4, EcN-5M2e + ck: n = 8). Data are presented as mean ± SEM. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageLong-lasting protection from the EcN-5M2e vaccineThe duration of the immune response is a critical factor in assessing the effectiveness of a vaccine. To evaluate the durability of the EcN-5M2e vaccine, we collected blood and mucosal samples (NALF and BALF) from mice at specific time points (Fig. 8a). Notably, the levels of M2e-specific IgG titers were only reduced 10-fold and remained above 103 180 days after the last immunization (Fig. 8b). Similarly, the levels of IgA antibodies in serum samples as well as IgA and IgG antibodies in BALF samples from the EcN-5M2e group remained consistently high 180 days after the last immunization (Fig. 8c, d; Supplementary Fig. 11a). IgA and IgG levels in NALF samples remained relatively high in the first 90 days and were still higher than in the PBS control group after 180 days (Fig. 8e; Supplementary Fig. 11b). 180 days after the 2nd booster vaccination, the mice were then infected with a lethal dose of H1N1 virus (5 × LD50). Mice that received PBS suffered significant weight loss and all died within 9 days. However, all mice immunized with EcN-5M2e survived, although they required more time to recover to the initial body weight due to the reduced antigen-specific immune responses (Fig. 8f, g). These data demonstrate that EcN-5M2e is an effective mucosal vaccine that continues to provide significant protection against fatal influenza infection even 6 months after the last immunization.Fig. 8: Duration and long-term protection of the EcN-5M2e vaccination against influenza A virus infection.a Schematic illustration of the immunization, sampling, and experimental procedure. b The endpoint titer of IgG against H1N1-M2e peptide was measured in sera collected at time points 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 months after the 2nd booster vaccination (n = 8/group). c–e IgA at Abs450 against H1N1-M2e peptide was measured in immune sera (c), BALF (d), or NALF (e) collected at time points 1, 3, and 6 months after the 2nd booster vaccination (PBS: n = 3; EcN-5M2e: n = 5). f, g Mice vaccinated with EcN-5M2e or PBS for 6 months were infected with 5 × LD50 of H1N1 virus, body weight (f) and survival (g) were monitored for 14 days (n = 8/group). Data are presented as mean ± SEM. Statistical significance was analyzed by two-tailed unpaired t-test (panels b–e). Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageDiscussionThe urgent need for novel therapeutic and preventive strategies against unanticipated epidemic or potential pandemic influenza virus strains is evident. In this study, we present convincing evidence that intranasal administration of the probiotic EcN activates host defense immunity in the lung, producing an immediate protective effect against influenza virus infection. Building on these findings, we developed a live probiotic vaccine called EcN-5M2e that expresses and secretes influenza virus antigens. The engineered EcN-5M2e triggers antigen-specific humoral and mucosal immune responses and provides broad and durable protection against influenza A viruses.Our work here provides the first evidence that intranasal prophylaxis with EcN modulates the lung immune microenvironment and provides immediate protection against influenza virus infection in mice. Previous studies have highlighted the importance of activation of type I interferons (IFN-α and IFN-β) for the protective effects of probiotics against influenza virus infection, including Lactobacillus40,41 and Bifidobacterium42,43 species. Interestingly, administration of EcN not only significantly induced the magnitude of type I interferon response but also increased the level of type II interferon (IFN-γ) in lung tissue (Fig. 1g), which can broadly induce the expression of interferon-stimulated antiviral genes44. These results suggest that prophylactic exposure to EcN in situ may induce IFN-γ to regulate innate immune responses and promote an antiviral response.Given the continuous antigenic drift and shift of influenza viruses, the development of a universal influenza vaccine is of utmost importance5. To address this issue, we developed a live-vector probiotic vaccine containing the 5M2e target to achieve broad-spectrum protection. Although antibodies against M2e are non-neutralizing compared to HA protein10,11, M2e-specific antibodies can bind to the M2e expressed on virus-infected host cells and reduce virus replication either by interfering with virus budding or by mediating the killing of infected lung epithelial cells by ADCC and ADCP12,45. In spite of the fact that we did not present recovered viral load data for adoptive transfer and the long-term protection experiments, our vaccine is successful in reducing lung viral load for H1N1, H3N2 and H6N6 at 3 or 5 dpi after vaccination (Fig. 5h; Supplementary Fig. 8), suggesting that EcN-5M2e is effective in suppressing influenza virus infection. Importantly, our engineered EcN-5M2e vaccine could be administered intranasally and elicits broad, potent and durable humoral and mucosal immune responses, which may provide protective effects against influenza virus infection from multiple perspectives.Improving the magnitude and breadth of humoral immune responses is critical to the development of highly effective and broadly protective influenza vaccines46. Our results suggest that EcN-5M2e vaccination is systematically effective in enhancing antibody responses (Fig. 4). While BALB/c mice are known to typically exhibit a Th2-type immune response, which is characterized by the production of IgG1 antibodies47, it is crucial to note that a Th1-type response, distinguished by the production of IgG2a antibodies and the recruitment of cytotoxic T lymphocytes, macrophages and NK cells48,49, plays a vital role in effectively clearing viral infections50. Previous studies have also highlighted the importance of IgG2a in M2e-mediated protective immunity7,45. Our results showed that intranasal immunization with EcN-5M2e induced significantly high titers of both M2e-specific IgG1 and IgG2a (Fig. 4c, d), indicating that the EcN-5M2e vaccine induced both Th2-biased and Th1-biased immunities. By stimulating both types of immune responses, the EcN-5M2e vaccine promises to provide broad protection against influenza viruses.In addition to serum IgG, IgA is the primary antibody produced by mucosal immune responses and plays a key role in blocking pathogen infection at mucosal tissues16. However, the efficacy of protein vaccines administered via injection is often limited in terms of inducing mucosal immunity and providing protection against mucosal infection51. This limitation arises due to the presence of adhesive mucous layers in the nasal epithelia, which act as barriers to pathogens and potentially compromise the activation of the mucosal immune system by most injectable protein-based vaccines52. In contrast, antigen delivered by live bacterial vector offers a novel and highly versatile platform53,54. EcN, in particular, has been shown to mediate interactions with mucosal epithelial cells and adhesion to the epithelial surface28, which may promote the induction of adaptive immune responses. The presence of IgA antibodies in the mucosal lavage fluids of EcN-5M2e immunized mice may increase the amplitude and breadth of these immune responses55. Therefore, immunization with EcN-5M2e has the potential to provide both homologous and heterologous protections. Combined with the limited protective effect of serum IgG in the passive transfer challenge experiment, our results suggest that IgA induced by EcN-5M2e may be a key factor in accelerating influenza virus clearance and resisting influenza virus infection.It is interesting to note that EcN-based vaccine enhances general IgA immune responses after viral challenge, as mice administered with EcN-vec or EcN-5M2e (neither of which expresses HA) produced higher levels of HA-IgA in lung tissue after influenza virus infection than the control group (Fig. 6f), suggesting that the EcN vehicle may activate pro IgA B cells and results in faster responses to pathogen infection. This phenotype is similar to what is observed in trained immunity. This involves the enhancement of innate immune responses triggered by certain stimuli and can provide protection against related or unrelated infections56. The development of antigen-specific resident memory B cells in the lung has also been reported to produce local IgG and IgA with enhanced variant cross-recognition and correlates with protection against reinfection in mice57. However, the detailed mechanisms for these effects of EcN need to be further investigated.Besides humoral and mucosal immune responses, we found that immunization of BALB/c mice with EcN-5M2e could significantly stimulate IFN-γ and IL-2 secretion produced by M2e-specific CD4+ T cells (Fig. 4h), and depletion of CD4+ T cells decreased the protective effects (Fig. 7). These data are consistent with previous data that T cell activation is associated with enhanced immunological memory, viral clearance and breadth of protection58,59.In summary, our research provides compelling evidence for the potential of developing EcN as an antiviral probiotic for the prevention of influenza virus infection. Our proof-of-concept study demonstrates that this vaccine approach could have widespread use as a “superseasonal” influenza A virus vaccine. EcN’s advantageous features, including its large carrier capacity, ease of editing, and flexible antigen presentation, position it as a promising multivalent platform to combat influenza viruses and other respiratory viruses with pandemic potential.MethodsMice, cells, viruses, strains, plasmids and oligosFemale BALB/c mice aged 6–8 weeks were purchased from Beijing Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co. Ltd, Beijing, China. The mice were bred and maintained at the Animal Center of Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). They were randomly assigned to groups and reared under specific pathogen-free (SPF) conditions (individually ventilated caging, ambient temperature 22 ± 2 °C, humidity 50 ± 5%, 12 h light/dark cycle) with ad libitum access to food and water. The infection experiments were carried out in the Animal Biosafety Level 2 (ABSL-2) Laboratory at WIV, CAS in accordance with the WIV institutional review board guidelines for animal care and use (ethics number WIVA14202101).Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells (ATCC CCL-34) were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco), 100 U mL−1 penicillin and 100 μg mL−1 streptomycin (Yeasen) at 37 °C in 5% CO2.The mouse-adapted strains of influenza A viruses, namely A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1), A/Hong Kong/4801/14 (H3N2) and A/Duck/Hubei/5/2010 (H6N6) were propagated in 10 day-old embryonated chicken eggs at 37 °C for 48 h. After virus growth, eggs were cooled overnight at 4 °C. The allantoic fluid recovered from the chilled eggs was centrifugated (4000 g for 10 min at 4 °C) to remove cellular debris. The viruses were then divided into aliquots and stored at −80 °C. The 50% lethal dose (LD50) of the viruses was measured60.EcN and its derivative strains were cultured in Luria Bertani (LB) medium. Cells were collected by centrifugation and the resulting cell pellets were resuspended in a protective buffer (15% v/v glycerol, 5% w/v trehalose, 2% w/v β-glucan and 10 mM MOPS, pH 7.3) at a concentration of 1010 CFU/mL and were frozen at −80 °C until further use61.All strains and plasmids used in this study are summarized in Supplementary Table 1. Oligos are listed in Supplementary Table 2.EcN vaccinationsMice were administrated 10 μL of EcN (108 CFU) or PBS intranasally (i.n.) on two consecutive days, and the body weight of mice was recorded daily for 7 days. To assess the influence of EcN treatment on cytokine expression, mice were humanely euthanized on day 1, 3, 7, and 14 to collect blood and lung samples.To evaluate the in vivo safety of EcN, routine blood tests were performed on mice. Fresh blood (50 μL) was collected from each mouse and immediately mixed with EDTA. The blood samples were then examined using a standard analyzer (Hemavet 950) to determine the number of white and red blood cells and platelets.In vivo bioluminescence imaging and colony forming unit analysesFor the in vivo distribution study, mice were intranasally administered EcN carrying the pKT-mCherry plasmid (EcN-mCherry) at a dose of 108 CFU/10 μL. Fluorescence imaging of mice at specific time points was performed using an in vivo imaging system (IVIS, PerkinElmer). Multiple regions of interest (ROI) corresponding to the mouse digestive tract, nose, or lung were manually determined for each individual mouse. Fluorescence was quantified using Living Image software54. For the in vivo tissue colony forming unit analysis, tissue samples were collected at the indicated time points and mechanically homogenized in PBS containing 15% glycerol. Dilutions of the homogenates were plated on LB agar plates containing 100 μg mL-1 kanamycin and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Colony forming units (CFU) were calculated for each organ.Phylogenetic analysis of M2eTo analyze the M2e sequences, all available full-length M2e sequences of influenza A viruses were downloaded from NCBI and duplicates were removed by Seqkit62. The resulting dataset consists of 289 unique M2e sequences derived from Homo sapiens. These sequences were aligned by Mafft63 and a maximum likelihood tree was constructed by iqtree64. The resulting tree was visualized using ggtree (accessible at http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/ggtree).5M2e expression and purificationThe 5M2e fragment was cloned into the pET21a vector using a ClonExpress II One-Step Cloning kit (Vazyme). The construct was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3). Protein expression was induced by adding 0.3 mM isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and incubating at 25 °C for 12 h65. The culture was centrifuged, and the pellet was resuspended in a buffer containing 40 mM Tris-HCl (pH7.9), 300 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 2 mM imidazole. The cell suspension was homogenized and centrifuged at 12,000 g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was incubated with a HisTrapTM HP column (GE Healthcare), washed with a washing buffer (40 mM Tris-HCl, pH7.9, containing 300 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 10 mM imidazole), and eluted with an elution buffer (40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, containing 300 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 100 mM imidazole).Recombinant EcN-5M2e constructionAn EcN mutant strain lacking the dapB gene encoding dihydrodipicolinate reductase was constructed using a suicide pDM4 plasmid66. Briefly, homologous regions upstream and downstream of the dapB gene were cloned into the pDM4 plasmid, which was then transformed into E. coli S17-1 cells as a parental donor strain. EcN carrying a temperature-sensitive pKD46 plasmid67 was used as parent recipient strain in transconjugation assay61. The single cross clones were selected with ampicillin (100 μg mL−1) and chloramphenicol (30 μg mL−1), and the double cross clones were selected in LB plates containing 15% sucrose and diaminopimelate (100 μg mL−1)35. The pKD46 plasmid in EcNΔdapB was removed by culturing the strain at 42 °C67. The deletion of the dapB gene in the EcNΔdapB strain was confirmed by PCR and DNA sequencing.To secrete the targeted 5M2e protein in the EcNΔdapB strain, the 5M2e fragment fused N-terminally to the 6×His-tag and C-terminally to the HlyA-tag (946-998 amino acids). The dapB gene, a fragment expressing type I secretion system components HlyBD68, and a P15A ori were assembled to form the pKT-5M2e-HlyABD plasmid (without antibiotic resistance gene). Next, the recombinant plasmid was transformed into EcNΔdapB to obtain a strain named EcN-5M2e, which was selected on LB medium without diaminopimelate. PCR was performed to confirm the presence of the pKT-5M2e-HlyABD plasmid in the EcN-5M2e strain. The EcNΔdapB strain transformed with the plasmid pKT-HlyABD (without 5M2e fragment) was designated as EcN-vec and used as a control.The stability of the pKT-5M2e-HlyABD plasmid in the EcN-5M2e strain was tested. Briefly, strains were subjected to 20 passages without selective pressure. At each passage, a monoclonal colony was selected and analyzed by PCR amplification of the 5M2e fragment and the dapB-deleted region.Growth assay of EcN-5M2eFreshly streaked colonies of EcN WT, EcNΔdapB, EcN-vec, and EcN-5M2e were incubated overnight at 37 °C. The cultures were then transferred to fresh M9 medium at a ratio of 1:100 and incubated at 37 °C for 16 h. Hourly measurements of OD600 were taken using a BioTek instrument.Western blot analysisTo assess the expression of the target protein, the strains were cultured overnight at 37 °C in LB medium. The cultures were centrifuged at 4000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the secreted proteins in the culture supernatant were concentrated using TCA precipitation69. The proteins in the supernatant and precipitate were subjected to gel electrophoresis. The proteins in the gel were then transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane, which was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk. The membrane was then incubated with a primary His-tag antibody (Cat#AF2876, Beyotime, 1:1000) or an M2e-specific 14C2 antibody (Cat#Ab5416, Abcam, 1:1000) for 2 h at room temperature. The membrane was then incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Cat#A0216, Beyotime, 1:10000) for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was washed three times with TBST, incubated with Clarity Western ECL substrate (Bio-rad) to cover the blot at room temperature, and then imaged with a luminescence imager.Mice immunizationTo evaluate humoral and mucosal responses, female BALB/c mice were immunized with EcN-5M2e three times at 2 week intervals (primer-boost-boost). Each immunization was performed by intranasal administration of 108 CFU/mouse in 10 µL on two consecutive days. Control mice received the same dose of EcN-vec or the same volume of PBS. The purified 5M2e protein was immunized subcutaneously three times at an interval of 2 weeks (primer-boost-boost). One week after each immunization, serum samples were collected to detect antibody titer.For long-term immunological evaluation, another group of mice was immunized with PBS or EcN-5M2e according to the same protocol. These mice were euthanized 1, 3 or 6 months after last immunization to collect mucosal samples. After vaccination, blood samples were collected from the orbital venous sinus at various time points and serum was isolated for antibody analysis.Indirect immunofluorescence assayMDCK cells were seeded into each well of a 24-well plate at a density of 2 × 105 in growth medium (DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum) and allowed to adhere overnight. Cells were then infected with H3N2 virus and cultured for 20 h at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1, washed with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. The cells were then incubated with either 14C2 antibody (Abcam) at a dilution of 1:200 or sera from immunised mice at a dilution of 1:50 for 1 hour at room temperature. After three washes with PBS, Alexa Fluor® 594 anti-mouse antibody (Cat#GTX213111-05, GeneTex) was used as the secondary antibody at a dilution of 1:1000. After five washes, nuclei were stained with DAPI in the dark. Cells were observed and photographed using a fluorescence microscope (Axio Observer.A1, Zeiss).Virus challengeThe preimmunized BALB/c mice were challenged intranasally with 10 × LD50 of H1N1, 10 × LD50 of H3N2 or 5 × LD50 of H6N6 in 20 μL of PBS. To test the protection in passive serum transfer, mice were infected with 5 × LD50 H1N1. To assess long-term protection, immunized mice were infected with 5 × LD50 H1N1. To evaluate the bacterial-induced immediate protection, mice were challenged with 2 × or 3 × LD50 H1N1. Body weight and number of mouse deaths were recorded daily until 14 dpi. Mice were humanely euthanized when their weight loss reached ≥ 30%.Serum passive transfer experimentMice (donors) were primed and boosted as described above and anesthetized 2 weeks after the 2nd booster vaccination and sera were collected. Naïve BALB/c mice (recipients) were administered intraperitoneally with 300 μL of sera per mouse10. After 18 h, blood was collected from mice in each group to determine IgG titers. After 24 h, mice were infected with 5 × LD50 H1N1. The weight and survival of each mouse were monitored daily until 14 days.Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assayPeptide-specific IgG or IgA antibody titers in serum, nasal lavage fluid (NALF), bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and intestinal lavage fluid (ILF) of BALB/c mice were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Briefly, 96-well plates (Corning) were coated with 2 μg mL−1 of synthesized M2e peptides (Supplementary Table 3) or purified HA protein (H1N1) in carbonate coating buffer overnight at 4 °C and then blocked in 3% BSA in PBS for 2 h at 37 °C. The 96-well plates were incubated with serially diluted serum, NALF, BALF, or ILF samples for 2 h at 37 °C. After washing the plates 5 times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 (PBST), 100 µL of HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Cat#A0216, Beyotime, 1:1000), IgG1 (Cat#AS066, ABclonal, 1:2000), IgG2a (Cat#AS065, ABclonal, 1:2000), or HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgA (Cat#CSA2107, Cohesion Biosciences, 1:2000) was added. The plates were then incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and washed 5 times with PBST. The reactions were carried out by adding 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethytlbenzidine (TMB) for 15 min at 37 °C, and stopped with 2 M H2SO4. Absorbance at 450 nm was measured with a Synergy H1 plate reader (Bio-Tek). The endpoint titer was defined as the highest reciprocal dilution of the detected sample that resulted in an absorbance >2.1-fold of the Abs450 value of the naïve mouse samples.Viral titrationLung tissue was collected from mice at 3 or 5 dpi. Lungs were washed three times with sterile PBS containing 0.1% BSA. All BALF samples were stored at −80 °C. To determine viral load, MDCK cells were seeded in 96-well plates at 1 × 104 cells/well. The BALF samples were serially diluted (1:10) in DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 2 µg mL-1 N-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-trypsin (Sigma). The diluted samples were then placed into MDCK cells and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 2 days. The neuraminidase assay was used to detect viruses in the supernatants, which were transferred to black 96-well plates and incubated with 20 μM MUNANA (Sigma) for 1 h at 37 °C. Fluorescence intensity was then measured using a Synergy H1 plate reader (Bio-Tek) with an excitation wavelength of 355 nm and an emission wavelength of 485 nm. The TCID50/mL titers were determined using the Reed-Muench method70.Multiplex analysis of cytokinesLungs were washed three times with PBS containing 0.1% BSA. The obtained BALF samples were stored at −80 °C. Cytokine levels were measured using the LEGENDplexTM Mouse Anti-Virus Response Panel (13-plex, BioLegend) according to the manufacturer’s recommended protocol.Flow cytometry analysisFlow cytometry was performed to access T cell responses in lungs after EcN treatment. Mice were euthanized and the tissues were cut into small pieces. The tissue fragments were then incubated in HBSS with 1 mg/mL collagenase I (Yeasen) and 0.1 U DNase I (Vazyme) for 30 min at 37 °C. The digested lung tissue was washed in RPMI 1640 medium, incubated in RBC lysis buffer (eBioscience) and filtered through a 70 µm cell strainer to obtain single cell suspensions. The resuspended lung cell cultures were stimulated with M2e peptide mixture (10 μg mL−1) for 16 h. Monensin (eBioscience) was added to cultures 6 h after stimulation and then incubated for a further 10 h. The cells were harvested and blocked with anti-mouse CD16/CD32 (Cat#553141, BD Biosciences) for 20 min on ice. After centrifugation, the cell suspensions were stained using surface stain antibodies together with Fixable Viability Dye eFluor™ 506 (eBioscience) for 30 min at 4 °C. The anti-mouse surface staining antibodies used to detect T cells in the lung included APC anti-mouse CD3 (Cat#155606, Biolegend), PE anti-mouse CD4 (Cat#100408, Biolegend), FITC anti-mouse CD8a (Cat#100706, Biolegend). After fixation and permeabilization with Cytofix/Cytoperm™ solution (BD Biosciences), cells were stained with combinations of the following intracellular cytokine staining antibodies: Alexa Fluor® 700 anti-mouse IL-2 (Cat#503818, Biolegend) and PE/Cyanine7 anti-mouse IFN-γ (Cat#505826, Biolegend). The gating strategy was shown in Supplementary Fig. 7. All stained cells were processed on a BD LSRFortessa and analyzed using FlowJo software.CD4+ T cell depletion in vivoFor T cell depletion experiments, BALB/c mice were injected intraperitoneally with 200 μg of anti-mouse CD4 monoclonal antibody (clone YTS 177), or rat IgG2a isotype control (clone 2A3) at −3, −2, −1, 2 days post infection. At the day of infection, the spleens and lungs were collected and analyzed by flow cytometry to determine the efficiency of cell depletion. All antibodies were obtained from BioXCell.Histopathology analysisThe left lung tissue was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for at least 48 h. After fixation, the tissues were dehydrated and embedded in paraffin71. Tissue sections with 5 µm thick were prepared and subjected to hematoxylin and eosin staining. The stained sections were then observed and photographed using a digital image analysis platform 3DHISTECH (Hungary). Two randomly selected sections of each mouse were evaluated in a double-blind manner, taking into account histopathological changes such as inflammation, structure changes and thickening of the alveolar wall. These changes were assessed according to the predefined scoring system71. To indicate lesion severity, a subjective numerical lesion severity score was assigned, ranging from 0 to 5. (0 means the lesion is absent; 1 means minimal; 2 means mild; 3 means moderate; 4 means marked; 5 means severe).Statistics and reproducibilityThe number of biological replicates and independent repeats used are described in figure legends. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. No data was excluded from the analyses. Animals were randomly divided into experimental groups. Data collection and analysis were not performed blind to the conditions of the experiments. The pathologists performing the histopathological analysis were blinded to treatment. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 9.0 software. Values were expressed as mean ± SEM in each figure. Statistical significance for group comparisons was determined using two-tailed unpaired t-test or one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.

Influenza and COVID-19 are respiratory diseases caused by the influenza virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and share clinical risk factors and symptoms. However, the extent of their shared genetic etiology remains unclear because the host genetic risk factors for COVID-19 are well characterized but not for influenza. Identifying common genetic risk factors could reveal targets to treat or prevent both infections. Study: Genetic risk factors for COVID-19 and influenza are largely distinct.

First, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of influenza was performed on data from more than 296,000 AncestryDNA COVID-19 study participants to explore how the same genetic factors influence the risk of influenza and COVID-19. Of these, 6.2% reported having been influenza-positive and were classified cases. The remainder of the population served as controls, including approximately 24,000 with negative results. Next, the team assessed associations between 10 million common variants and reported influenza infection in three ancestral groups. A meta-analysis of the results across ancestries identified two loci associated with reported influenza near β-1,3-galactosyltransferase 5 (B3GALT5) and ST6 β-galactoside α-2,6-sialyltransferase 1 (ST6GAL1) on chromosomes 3q27.3 and 21q22.2, respectively. Results from GWAS of influenza were used to evaluate whether influenza and SARS-CoV-2 infections share genetic etiology. To this end, they focused on 24 COVID-19-associated variants reported by the Host Genetics Initiative. Only one variant, rs505922 in histo-blood group ABO system transferase (ABO), was associated with influenza; the variant reduced COVID-19 risk but increased the risk of influenza. The lack of directionally consistent and significant associations between influenza and COVID-19 loci suggested few or no shared genetic risk factors between the two diseases. Further analyses were performed to evaluate whether influenza associations were reproducible and robust. Excluding over 253,800 people lacking data on influenza tests from the AncestryDNA cohort did not affect the effect size estimates for either locus. By contrast, defining influenza based on whether participants reported flu-like symptoms attenuated effect sizes, albeit they remained significant. In addition, to assess reproducibility, medical records were accessed to define the lifetime influenza status of 1.15 million participants from seven biobanks across five ancestries.

A meta-analysis revealed genome-wide significant and directionally consistent associations with B3GALT5 and ST6GAL1. Besides, two measures of recent influenza corroborated the associations. Significant associations were evident with a positive influenza A culture (indicating current infection) in a cohort of over 82,000 people. Further, both variants reduced the risk of a seropositive influenza A test in a cohort of 1,000 people. Notably, the B3GALT5 variant reduced the risk of flu-related hospitalization among cases. No additional associations were identified. Moreover, no associations were observed between COVID-19 risk variants and influenza in this more extensive analysis. Next, the GWAS signal’s likely effector genes were identified, focusing on the lead variants at 3q27.3 and 21q22.2. Four genes, adiponectin (ADIPOQ), immunoglobulin superfamily member 5 (IGSF5), B3GALT5, and ST6GAL1, were prioritized based on high linkage disequilibrium between each variant, and enhancer-overlapping variants and sentinel expression quantitative trait loci. Analysis of missense and loss-of-function variants (via exome sequencing) revealed no significant associations. However, a missense variant in IGSF5 was associated with a 9.2-fold increased risk of medical record influenza. Finally, in vitro experiments were performed to examine the effects of gene expression knockdown on the infectivity of influenza H1N1 virus in Calu-3 and A549 cell lines, focusing on two likely effector genes: B3GALT5 and ST6GAL1. ST6GAL1 knockdown approximately reduced influenza infectivity by 50%, whereas B3GALT5 knockdown was not associated with a consistent effect on infectivity. Conclusions Taken together, the findings indicate that the genetic architectures of influenza and COVID-19 are largely distinct. The team identified genome-wide significant loci for influenza and showed that ST6GAL1 inhibition decreases infectivity in vitro. The study’s limitations include phenotype misclassification, use of self-reported influenza status, undetermined influenza strain, and confounding effects from unmeasured risk factors for influenza.

The IRAT is used to assess the potential pandemic risk posed by influenza A viruses that are not currently circulating in people. Purpose The current overall individual and population health risk to the general public posed by the avian influenza A(H5N1) virus presently spreading in cows, poultry, and other mammals remains low. Systematic comparisons of data related to this avian influenza A(H5N1) virus using the Influenza Risk Assessment Tool (IRAT) to data from other influenza A viruses has scored this virus's future pandemic potential as "moderate risk" based on information through June 26, 2024. This is similar to previous assessments of earlier avian influenza A(H5N1) viruses. The IRAT uses expert opinion to evaluate the potential of a representative novel influenza virus to gain the ability for person-to-person spread and the resulting potential public health impact if that were to happen, compared to other viruses evaluated in past IRAT reports. The IRAT does not assess the immediate risk to the public's health, which is unchanged and remains low, and it does not predict future pandemics. This report summarizes the findings of an IRAT conducted on a recent avian influenza A(H5N1) virus from a human case in Texas (A/Texas/37/2024). The score places the currently circulating avian influenza A(H5N1) virus in the category of "moderate risk" for potential future emergence and public health impact. This is similar to previous assessments of earlier avian influenza A(H5N1) viruses. The scores for this IRAT were submitted June 26, 2024, prior to additional human cases in Colorado. The report was completed expeditiously based on data as of June 26 to inform ongoing preparedness discussions. During a public health response, the IRAT can be used to assess the appropriateness of the ongoing response efforts and whether additional actions are warranted based on the risk score. The results of this IRAT validate the proactive, coordinated U.S. government response. Assessing risk is an iterative process with new information being assimilated regularly and response activities adjusted as indicated. Key findings On August 9, 2024, CDC published a new IRAT assessment for A/Texas/37/2024, an avian influenza A(H5N1) clade 2.3.4.4b virus that was associated with a human infection in a person in Texas who had exposure to A(H5N1) virus-infected dairy cows. Avian influenza A(H5N1) clade 2.3.4.4b viruses are causing outbreaks in wild birds and poultry, occasional infections in mammals, and rare human infections in the United States and globally. Between April 1, 2024 and August 9, 2024, eight human cases of A(H5N1) bird flu and five human cases of A(H5) bird flu were reported in the United States. The first of these was reported on April 1, 2024, when the State of Texas announced that a person tested positive for HPAI A(H5N1) virus. Previously, CDC had assessed two other avian influenza A(H5N1) clade 2.3.4.4b viruses: the A/American wigeon/South Carolina/AH0195145/2021 and the A/mink/Spain/3691-8_22VIR10586-10/2022. Both viruses had overall estimated IRAT scores in the moderate risk category range of 4.0 to 7.9. This updated assessment includes new information since then, including information from additional human cases reported in the United States (but excluding recent human cases among poultry workers associated with exposure to infected poultry at poultry farms in Colorado). This updated assessment using the virus from the first human case in Texas, indicates that this A/Texas/37/2024 virus has scored slightly lower in some risk elements and slightly higher in others compared with the previously assessed H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b viruses. However, the mean-high and mean-low acceptable score ranges for these viruses overlap, indicating that these viruses remain similar, and their overall risk scores remain "moderate." New data visualizations have been added to this page to aid in the comparison of these viruses. The Influenza Risk Assessment Tool (IRAT) is an evaluation tool conceived by CDC and further developed with assistance from global animal and human health influenza experts. The IRAT is used to assess the potential pandemic risk posed by influenza A viruses that are not currently circulating in people. The IRAT does not predict pandemics, and the IRAT is not used to assess the risk of H5N1 bird flu to the general public, which current remains low. Input on IRAT assessments is provided by a diverse group of U.S. government animal and human health influenza experts. More information about the IRAT, including a description of its methodology and definitions for its risk elements and categories, is available at Influenza Risk Assessment Tool (IRAT). The IRAT is updated when new zoonotic or novel influenza viruses with pandemic potential emerge or undergo a change in characteristics that prompts the need for a new assessment. The full report is available. Background The IRAT is a tool used to assess the potential pandemic risk posed by influenza A viruses. It is designed for use by public health professionals for pandemic preparedness purposes. It is not intended to be used to determine the current public health risk to the general public. The current risk to the general public from contemporary H5N1 avian influenza (bird flu) viruses is still considered low. The current H5N1 bird flu continues to be mostly an animal health issue. Human infections with H5N1 bird flu are rare, and these viruses are not well-adapted for spreading among people, as they do not currently have the ability to easily infect the human upper respiratory tract. Most past human infections have occurred following close, unprotected contact with sick or dead birds.

The goals of the present cross-sectional survey were to investigate attitudes and behaviors toward the simultaneous vaccination against seasonal influenza and COVID-19 and the factors associated. Methods: Questionnaires were self-administered or researcher-administered between October 2023 and February 2024 in an immunization center in the southern part of Italy. Results: All 151 subjects eligible for influenza and COVID-19 vaccinations who attended the center agreed to participate. A total of 59.9% of respondents received concurrent seasonal influenza and COVID-19 vaccinations. Those who perceived that the simultaneous vaccination was safer and those who have been infected by SARS-CoV-2 fewer times were more likely to have simultaneously received both vaccinations. Regarding the reasons reported, half of the sample stated that the simultaneous vaccination was safe and that they were adequately informed. This was more likely indicated by the respondents who had received at least four doses of the COVID-19 vaccination. Among those who had not received the simultaneous vaccination, 70.7% and 29.3% had received only seasonal influenza and COVID-19. Conclusion: Educational health communication campaigns are necessary to improve compliance with simultaneous administration of seasonal influenza and COVID-19 vaccinations and to increase the unsatisfactory coverage. 1 Introduction Annual influenza and COVID-19 vaccinations with high coverage are the primary effective tools for reducing the disease burden related to their morbidity, hospitalizations, and mortality, especially among those that have been identified at an increased risk, such as older people, healthcare workers (HCWs), pregnant women, and people with underlying clinical conditions. In Italy, annual influenza vaccination is recommended and free of charge to several groups, such as people aged ≥60 years, HCWs, individuals with chronic medical conditions and their relatives, pregnant women, and children aged from 6 months to 6 years, with a target coverage of 75% among people aged ≥60 years, HCWs, and individuals with chronic medical conditions (1). However, the uptake is routinely significantly lower than the target, and for those aged ≥65 years, it was only 56.7% in the 2021–2022 influenza season (2). Moreover, in September 2023, an estimated more than 40 million people were eligible for a booster dose of the COVID-19 vaccination, and only approximately 2 million had been vaccinated, despite it being recommended and free of charge for all individuals (3, 4). It is well known that vaccine hesitancy, one of the 10 most serious threats to global health, has a significant impact on vaccinations’ intentions and uptake (5). The World Health Organization (WHO) recommended the simultaneous vaccination against seasonal influenza and COVID-19 vaccines, considering their public health benefits in terms of acceptance and improvements in the coverage of both and the efficiency of preventive healthcare services (6). Recent studies showed that the concomitant administration of both vaccines elicited immune protection against both viruses, with no safety concerns (7–10). Moreover, although research has focused on the simultaneous vaccination of seasonal influenza with bivalent mRNA COVID-19 (11, 12), to the best of our knowledge, studies conducted in Italy are lacking (13–16). Such data are critically important and required to help decision-making by policymakers and public health professionals to design and develop effective counseling and education interventions aimed at addressing concerns or potential barriers to their adherence and for planning tailored vaccination strategies for simultaneous vaccination among the target population. Therefore, to fill this knowledge gap, the goals of the present cross-sectional survey were to investigate and understand the attitudes and behaviors toward the simultaneous vaccination against seasonal influenza and COVID-19 and the factors that may influence the simultaneous vaccination. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Study setting and sample recruitment This survey took place in a vaccination center in a Teaching Hospital located in the city of Naples, Southern Italy. The sample used all individuals for whom the COVID-19 and annual influenza vaccinations are recommended and available free of charge and who attended the center to receive the COVID-19 or seasonal influenza vaccine between October 2023 and February 2024. 2.2 Data collection Well-trained research investigators, with professional skills in recruiting respondents and knowledge of the topic, approached each subject after the vaccination in the waiting room of the center. Participants were informed about the survey’s objectives and procedures, about data anonymity and confidentiality at all stages, that the survey was answered voluntarily, and that they had the right to withdraw at any time during the survey. Informed verbal consent was obtained from all participants prior to the start of the survey. The research investigators asked each participant to complete the questionnaire and to return it immediately once it was filled. For those who had difficulties in reading or writing, a face-to-face interview was conducted by the research investigators. Participants did not receive compensation or incentive upon questionnaire completion. 2.3 Survey instrument The survey instrument utilized for data collection was adapted from previous similar published surveys conducted by some of us in different groups (17–19). The instrument contained three sections and took an average of 10 min to complete. The first section collected socio-demographic and anamnestic information, including gender, age, marital status, employment, and diagnosis of chronic medical conditions, whether they had been infected by SARS-CoV-2, whether they had received one or more doses of the COVID-19 vaccine, and seasonal influenza vaccination uptake in the previous 2 years. Questions were mainly closed-ended, with simple categorical questions for socio-demographics, yes or no questions, and open-ended. The second section investigated attitudes toward the perceived severity of COVID-19 and influenza diseases, the efficacy, and the safety of the simultaneous vaccination. Respondents reported the extent of their agreement or disagreement with each item administered on a 10-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 10 (very much). Participants were asked to indicate their reasons for having received or not received the simultaneous vaccinations from a list of five options, with the possibility to select multiple answers. If respondents did not receive the vaccinations simultaneously, their intention to receive the other one at a different time was measured with an item with three options: “yes,” “no,” and “do not know.” The third section queried the sources of information regarding the simultaneous vaccination and whether they needed additional information. The questionnaire underwent pilot testing among 15 individuals with the eligible criteria to ensure clarity and comprehensibility. Since no changes were made, the results were included in the analysis. 2.4 Statistical analysis Descriptive statistics were used to present the survey results, including frequencies and proportions for categorical variables, and means, ranges, and standard deviations for continuous variables. Then, the chi-square test or Student’s t-test was used in the bivariate analysis to assess the association between dichotomous and continuous variables and the outcomes of interest. Independent variables with a p-value ≤0.25 in bivariate analysis were included in multivariate logistic regression models using a stepwise procedure for variable selection, with a significant level of the p-value for the inclusion and elimination of the variables set at 0.2 and 0.4, respectively. The outcomes of interest were the following: having received simultaneously the vaccinations against seasonal influenza and COVID-19 (Model 1) (0 = no; 1 = yes) and having received simultaneously the vaccinations against seasonal influenza and COVID-19 because it was safe and they were adequately informed (0 = no; 1 = yes) (Model 2). The following independent variables have been tested for all outcomes: age in years (<60 = 0; ≥60 = 1), gender (male = 0; female = 1), marital status (unmarried/separated/divorced/widowed = 0; married/cohabitant = 1), baccalaureate/graduate/post-graduate degree (no = 0; yes = 1), having at least one chronic disease (no = 0; yes = 1), having been infected by SARS-CoV-2 (no = 0; once = 1; twice = 2), having received at least four doses of COVID-19 vaccination (no = 0; yes = 1), having received simultaneously the vaccinations against seasonal influenza and COVID-19 in the past (no = 0; yes = 1), having acquired information from scientific societies or journals or meetings (no = 0; yes = 1), and need of additional information (no = 0; yes = 1). The independent variables believed that both diseases were severe (0–9 = 0; 10 = 1), had high concern about getting both diseases (0–9 = 0; 10 = 1), and believed that the simultaneous vaccinations against seasonal influenza and COVID-19 was safe (continuous) have been tested in Model 1. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to assess the strength and direction of associations between independent variables and outcomes of interest in the multivariate regression models. A two-sided p-value of 0.05 or less was considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed using the STATA 18 software. 3 Results All 151 eligible subjects were enrolled in the survey, yielding a 100% response rate. Table 1 depicts the general demographic data, professional, and anamnestic characteristics of the study population. Most respondents were male, with a mean age of 51.7 years. A total of 41.2% had a post-graduate degree, almost half were HCWs, 40.9% had at least one chronic disease, two-thirds had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 (66%), and more than half after the third dose (51.5%), and only 7.6% and 12.5% self-reported having received vaccinations against seasonal influenza and COVID-19 in 2021 and 2022, respectively. Table 1 Table 1. Main socio-demographic, professional, and anamnestic characteristics of the sample. The results regarding the attitudes toward COVID-19 and influenza diseases and their vaccinations, measured on a 10-point Likert-type scale, showed that participants considered COVID-19 to be more severe than influenza, with mean values of 7.5 and 6.3, respectively. The belief that both diseases were very severe, with values of 10, was indicated by only 8% of the sample. Although the concern of being infected was low, respondents exhibited greater apprehension regarding COVID-19 than influenza, with mean values of 6.3 and 5.5, respectively. The simultaneous vaccination against seasonal influenza and COVID-19 was perceived to be useful and safe, with mean values of 8.3 and 8. Among all respondents, only 4 out of 151 had already received the seasonal influenza vaccination. Among the remaining 147 participants, vaccinations were simultaneously administered to 88 of them (59.9%). Table 2 displays the results from the multivariate logistic regression models investigating the independent factors associated with the two outcomes of interest. Respondents who perceived safe the simultaneous vaccination against seasonal influenza and COVID-19 (OR = 1.52; 95% CI = 1.22–1.91) and those who had been infected by SARS-CoV-2 fewer times (OR = 0.51; 95% CI = 0.26–0.96) were significantly more likely to receive both vaccinations simultaneously (Model 1). Table 2 Table 2. Results of the multivariate logistic regression analysis showing the factors associated with the outcomes of interest. Belief in the safety of simultaneous vaccinations against seasonal influenza and COVID-19 (59.8%) was the most common reason for deciding to simultaneously receive both, followed by not having to attend the immunization center twice (50.6%) and having adequate information (43.7%). The multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that only one variable was significantly associated with having received both vaccinations simultaneously because it was safe and because they were adequately informed (49%). These reasons were more likely to be indicated by those who had received at least four doses of COVID-19 vaccination (OR = 2.05; 95% CI = 1.03–4.09) (Model 2). Preferring to get the vaccinations at different times (42.4%), having never received two vaccinations at the same time (17%), and being concerned about the safety of the simultaneous vaccinations against seasonal influenza and COVID-19 (11.8%) were the main reasons for not having received both vaccinations simultaneously. Among the 59 respondents who had not received the vaccinations against seasonal influenza and COVID-19 simultaneously, 70.7% and 29.3% had received only seasonal influenza and COVID-19, respectively. An additional question was about their willingness to be vaccinated against the other disease, with 47.4% were unsure, 28% did not intend to receive it, and only 24.6% were willing to receive it. The vast majority of the respondents had acquired information about the simultaneous vaccination against seasonal influenza and COVID-19 (87.3%). Scientific journals were the most common source (26.7%), followed by the Internet (24.4%) and mass media (22.9%). Only one-fifth (20.8%) were interested in obtaining additional information. 4 Discussion The present survey provides insight into the simultaneous vaccination against seasonal influenza and COVID-19 and the linked factors, in the post-pandemic phase of COVID-19 among eligible populations in Italy. The information gathered in this investigation provides contributions to the existing literature that should be useful for public health interventions and strategies. First, less than two-thirds of the respondents (59.9%) had received both vaccinations simultaneously. This result is very similar to that reported among a sample of HCWs in Italy (60%) (20), but considerably higher than what has been previously observed in the United States with 43% (21), 36.5% (22), and 11.1% (12). Moreover, it has been described that administering these vaccinations simultaneously leads to a potential increase in the uptake of COVID-19, primarily because many individuals had received the vaccine against seasonal influenza in previous seasons (23). Among those who did not accept the simultaneous vaccination, two-thirds had been vaccinated against seasonal influenza, and only less than one-third had the COVID-19 vaccination. It is a key point, therefore, to adopt strategies to increase adherence to simultaneous vaccination among those who already get the seasonal influenza vaccination. Nevertheless, a survey conducted by some of us showed that two-thirds were willing to accept the simultaneous vaccination (24). This may be because COVID-19 is no longer a global health emergency, resulting in a consequent lower concern about this disease and a decrease in simultaneous vaccination uptake. Second, a variety of reasons have been indicated by the sample for their decision to receive or not receive simultaneous vaccinations against seasonal influenza and COVID-19. Belief in the safety of simultaneous vaccinations was the most reported reason. This finding is consistent with previous literature in diverse populations, which revealed that those who intend to get vaccinated against COVID-19 were less likely to believe that the vaccinations were unsafe and also had a more positive attitude toward them (25–28). Moreover, the findings showed that the most frequently cited reasons by the respondents for not having received both vaccinations simultaneously were preferring to get them at different times, having never received two vaccinations at the same time, and safety concerns. The striking finding regarding the concern follows previous literature, also regarding other vaccinations, as vaccine safety has been cited as a reason for non-vaccination (29–31). This finding is still of great relevance from a public health point of view and underscores the importance of addressing the reasons behind low simultaneous uptake and clearing up any misconceptions about the vaccine. By targeting these issues, public health workers and policymakers can work to increase uptake and reduce the burden of diseases. Third, the results of the multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed interesting and significant associations between the two measured outcomes of interest and the various factors. In regard to the first outcome, respondents who perceived that the simultaneous vaccination was safe were more likely to have received it. This finding confirmed what has been observed in previous research, showing that respondents’ beliefs in the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 and influenza vaccinations were significant predictors of improving vaccination uptake for COVID-19 (32, 33). Moreover, the positive relationship between fewer times of infection with SARS-CoV-2 and the simultaneous vaccination may be because respondents probably perceive themselves to be more susceptible to getting COVID-19, and this might have encouraged them to protect (34, 35). Regarding the second outcome, the survey showed a positive and statistically significant relationship between having already received at least four doses of the COVID-19 vaccine and the simultaneous vaccination because they believed that it was safe and that they had adequate information. The previous experience with vaccination might have led to this appropriate decision to pay more attention to their health status. This supports the literature that reports having already received vaccinations as an important factor influencing vaccine acceptance against these and other diseases (36–38). Interestingly, scientific sources of information, such as societies, journals, and meetings, had, although not statistically significant, a positive effect on having received the vaccination simultaneously because they believed that it was safe and because they were confident that they had adequate information. In other words, these sources have the potential to influence vaccination decisions and play a key role in improving simultaneous vaccination uptake and positive intention. The association between the use of scientific sources and the vaccinations’ knowledge and attitudes and the likelihood for the population of receiving or for HCWs recommending vaccines to patients is evident in the findings from prior studies conducted in Italy and in other countries, where having received information from these sources is a significant positive and crucial predictor for vaccination initiation (39–42). Therefore, the use of these sources with accurate information is key to improving vaccination rates. Furthermore, the second source of information was the Internet, which is concerning because several previous surveys have shown that those who received information about the vaccines from this source were less likely to be vaccinated and more likely to be hesitant for themselves or their child (43–46). A number of potential methodological limitations inherent to any similar survey should be acknowledged in interpreting the present findings. First, this used a cross-sectional design; therefore, no causal relationships between the predictors and the different outcomes of interest can be established. Second, the recruitment was conducted only in a vaccination center in a geographic area, and thus the sample may not adequately represent the whole population in Italy, and the findings may not be generalizable. Third, the limited sample size gives results that may not be sufficiently powered to detect a difference between the groups, leading to results that may lack reliability and generalizability. Fourth, the data were collected through self-reporting on vaccine status for up to 2 years, acknowledging the potential for recall bias, and there was no verification of the answers with documentation. Fifth, the attitudes may have been influenced by social desirability bias, with respondents giving favorable comments that led to an overestimation of their intention to have the second vaccine at a different time. However, given the fact that the questionnaire was anonymous, it is plausible that this bias should be limited. Despite these limitations, this survey provides a valuable representation with important implications for building health policy strategies. To conclude, this survey provides useful information and underscores the critical need for the implementation of targeted evidence-based educational interventions and health communication campaigns with timely and accurate information to enhance simultaneous vaccination against seasonal influenza and COVID-19. Interventions are necessary to improve compliance with the simultaneous administration of these vaccines to reduce the use of resources and increase the very unsatisfactory vaccination coverage.

They detailed their findings in a letter to the New England Journal of Medicine.The workers were employed at two separate farms. The first patient began having right-eye symptoms 1 day after milk had splashed in their eye while milking a cow. The worker had not been wearing personal protective equipment. Nasopharyngeal samples were negative in tests at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), but the eye swab sample was positive for H5N1 influenza. Meanwhile, the worker from the second farm sought evaluation at an urgent care clinic after experiencing symptoms such as cough, shortness of breath, sore throat, and fever. Illness signs turned up in the cows 1 day before the worker's symptoms began, and H5N1 was confirmed in the herd 1 week later. The worker had cared for sick cows, including administering oral fluid therapy, which typically involves contact with the animal's oral secretions. The worker used eye protection and gloves, but not a respirator or a mask.On day 8 of illness, the patient was given oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and began home isolation. Symptoms began improving 24 hours after treatment began. Testing of a nasopharyngeal sample at the CDC was positive for H5 influenza, which the CDC later identified as H5N1. Eye and oropharyngeal samples were negative.The authors said the infections highlight the ongoing risk to farm workers who are exposed to raw milk and secretions from infected cows.More H5N1 confirmed in cows and poultryThe US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) today added one more dairy herd from Colorado to its list of confirmed H5N1 outbreaks, raising the national total to 190 from 13 states. Colorado is the hardest-hit state, with 63 of the confirmed outbreaks.Meanwhile, APHIS confirmed one more outbreak in poultry, which involves a facility in Florida's Miami-Dade County that has 5,400 birds. In July, APHIS had reported H5N1 outbreaks in three Miami-Dade live-bird markets.

Researchers at the Institute of Virology and Immunology, Switzerland, have developed a novel, two-step flu vaccination strategy that combines intramuscular injection of a viral vectored flu vaccine with nasal spray administration of a new attenuated live flu virus. This approach appears to be safe and effective in porcine models. Live-attenuated vaccines are more effective than seasonal flu vaccines. The teams’ live-attenuated vaccine candidate induced a potent local immune response that protected pigs against flu virus, although it was shed from the upper respiratory tract for a prolonged time. Therefore, there is a chance that it could be transmitted to individuals with compromised immune systems, if used in humans. Robin Avanthay and his colleagues developed a two-step immunisation strategy to balance the advantages and risks. The pigs were primed with a vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) as a vaccine delivery mechanism, a promising vector approach. Then, the live-attenuated flu vaccine candidate, NS1(1-126)-ΔPAX, was nasally administered. Contrastingly to frequently used VSV-vectored vaccines, the vaccine used in this study was propagation-defective, engineered to perform only a single round of infection for safety. A strong immune response was seen both body-wide and specifically in the upper respiratory tract where initial flu infection occurs. Also, no infection was identified in the two-step-vaccinated pigs, following exposure to virulent flu virus. Compared to pigs that only received NS1(1-126)-ΔPAX, the two-step-vaccinated pigs demonstrated much less shedding of the vaccine candidate from their upper respiratory tract. Notably, the intranasally administered live vaccine enhanced the systemic flu-specific antibody response and higher frequencies of flu-specific T helper memory cells were seen. Although further testing is required before this approach can be used in humans, the scientists believe that this new two-step vaccination strategy could enable the duration of protective immunity, and protection against flu virus variants. This study was published in PLOS Pathogens.

Data from the Canadian Immunization Research Network’s Serious Outcomes Surveillance Network (2011/2012–2018/2019 influenza seasons) enabled the selecting of all laboratory-confirmed influenza patients. A machine learning-based approach then identified variables, generated weighted scores, and evaluated model performance. This study included 12,954 patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza infections. The optimal scale encompassed ten variables: demographic (age and sex), health history (smoking status, chronic pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, and influenza vaccination status), clinical presentation (cough, sputum production, and shortness of breath), and function (need for regular support for activities of daily living). As a continuous variable, the scale had an AU-ROC of 0.73 (95% CI, 0.71–0.74). Aggregated scores classified participants into three risk categories: low (ISS < 30; 79.9% sensitivity, 51% specificity), moderate (ISS ≥ 30 but < 50; 54.5% sensitivity, 55.9% specificity), and high (ISS ≥ 50; 51.4% sensitivity, 80.5% specificity). ISS demonstrated a solid ability to identify patients with hospitalized laboratory-confirmed influenza at increased risk for Major Clinical Events, potentially impacting clinical practice and research.

The impact of influenza can vary depending on several factors, such as the virus, the host, and contextual factors like the degree of match achieved between vaccine and circulating strains, vaccine coverage, and pre-existing population immunity1,2,3. Despite this variability, influenza remains a significant burden on people’s health worldwide, with approximately one billion cases annually, of which 3–5 million are severe and 290,000–650,000 result in influenza-related deaths4,5.Although most cases have a benign course, some are at increased risk of adverse clinical outcomes, including children < 5 years, older adults, and those with a high comorbidity burden2,6,7. On the other hand, influenza vaccination and the timely use of antivirals have proved effective in attenuating these outcomes2,3,8,9 Understanding the benefits of these interventions requires a comprehensive evaluation in relation to illness severity, a gap in existing knowledge.Influenza severity ranges from mild illness treated at home without any intervention or seen on an outpatient basis to more severe illness, including the need for ventilatory support, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, or death. A recent review revealed several popular tools employed for assessing the severity of influenza and community-acquired pneumonia, such as the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI), CURB-65, Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II), Sequential Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), and quick SOFA (qSOFA)7. Although these tools are used to estimate the severity of influenza, they are not specific to it.Thus, there is an unmet need for a standardized risk assessment for influenza, particularly to characterize and estimate the probability of experiencing adverse clinical outcomes by score or a predetermined risk level and to adjust studies assessing the effect of interventions on these outcomes. In addition to being robust, this tool must be simple enough to allow its application in retrospective and prospective studies. Such a tool would enable public health systems to establish proper surveillance and evaluate the effectiveness of public health protocols tailored by risk severity.Here, we aimed to develop a scale that can identify patients at risk of severe influenza outcomes, thus helping to guide preventive and therapeutic interventions.MethodsData sourceThe Canadian Immunization Research Network (CIRN) is a nationwide group of top vaccine experts working on vaccine safety, effectiveness, and acceptance (https://cirnetwork.ca/). They also focus on the implementation and evaluation of vaccination programs. CIRN plays a key role in providing research insights that help shape public health decisions related to vaccinations, ultimately benefiting the health of Canadians. The CIRN Serious Outcomes Surveillance (SOS) Network, established in 2009, aims to understand the impact of influenza and assess how effective seasonal flu vaccines are. As such, hospitalized patients meeting a broad definition of acute respiratory illness who have been tested for influenza are enrolled, either as test-positive influenza cases or test-negative controls. The SOS Network actively monitors influenza cases at multiple hospitals across several Canadian provinces each season3,10,11,12,13,14, gathering data from different sites depending on available resources. This study used pooled data from the CIRN SOS Network database.ParticipantsWe used data from the 2011/2012 to 2018/2019 influenza seasons, selecting all patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza infection. The present analyses used data collected during the initial assessment of the patient within the hospital, which reflects the patient's condition immediately after being hospitalized. All hospitalized patients across the full range of illness severity were included in the present analyses, including those with and without supplemental oxygen and those requiring ventilatory support and ICU admission. There were no other data filters, and we kept all cases with missing values.The study adhered to the guidelines outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. The Research Ethics Boards approved the protocol, including data and sample collection and medical record review at all participating institutions (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT1517191).Definition of influenza infectionNasopharyngeal swab samples from all participating subjects underwent reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) influenza testing15. Subjects were classified as “laboratory-confirmed cases” if they tested positive for influenza or “negative controls” if they tested negative. Only laboratory-confirmed influenza cases were included in the present analyses.Data collectionDemographic and clinical data collection followed a standardized CIRN SOS Network protocol described elsewhere13,16. A broad set of variables from the SOS dataset were fed into model development. Demographic data included sex and age. Health-related data included: smoking status, clinical symptoms and signs (feverishness, nasal congestion, headache, abdominal pain, malaise, cough, diarrhea, weakness, shortness of breath, vomiting, dizziness, sore throat, nausea, muscle aches, arthralgia, prostration, seizures, myalgia, sneezing, conjunctivitis, sputum production, chest pain, encephalitis, nose bleed, altered consciousness, chills, and anorexia), function i.e. degree of dependence on activities of daily living (transferring, ambulating, need for assistive devices to ambulate, balance, bathing, toileting, handling medications, dressing, eating, handling finances), need for regular support for activities of daily living, need for additional support for activities of daily living, sensory disturbances (vision, hearing, and speech), bladder and bowel dysfunction, appetite disturbances, and comorbidities (ischemic heart disease, cardiac arrhythmias, valvular disease, congestive heart failure, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, dementia, other noncognitive neurological disorders, hemiplegia/paraplegia, chronic pulmonary disease, pulmonary vascular disease, rheumatological disease, peptic ulcer disease, liver disease, diabetes mellitus, solid tumor, any type of metastatic cancer, HIV/AIDS, hypothyroidism, lymphoma, coagulopathy, blood loss anemia, deficiency anemia, alcohol abuse, drug abuse, obesity, involuntary weight loss, fluid and electrolyte disorders, edema, any psychiatric disease, depression, and peripheral skin ulcers). Influenza vaccination status was deemed “vaccinated” for those who received a current season flu vaccine more than 14 days before the onset of symptoms and “unvaccinated” if otherwise. Data collection was done by on-site study monitors who obtained the data for each patient based on the best possible source, including a review of patient charts or medical records and interviews with patients, family members, and healthcare team members where required. Influenza vaccination status was verified using medical records or registries where available or through contact with the immunizing health care professional.Outcomes of interestThe outcome of interest in this sample of patients was defined as the occurrence of a Major Clinical Event (MCE). We chose this outcome as it is a specific and measurable health event for which all study subjects were at risk at the time of hospitalization. MCE was defined as a composite outcome of the need for supplemental oxygen therapy, admission to an intermediate care unit, need for non-invasive or invasive ventilation, admission to an intensive care unit, or death. To assess the diagnostic accuracy of the scale in predicting MCE outcome, two steps were taken: (1) assessing the scale's overall diagnostic performance as a continuous variable and (2) grouping scores into three risk categories (low, moderate, and high) based on sensitivity and specificity values. The population's risk level must be considered when deciding on the test’s minimum sensitivity and specificity levels. For low-risk individuals, a minimum specificity of 50% and maximum sensitivity should be chosen to ensure that those at low risk are identified without reducing the detectability of those at higher risk. For high-risk individuals, a minimum sensitivity of 50% and maximum specificity should be selected to ensure that those at higher risk are detected without reducing the screening of those at lower risk. The remaining scores were classified as moderate risk.Development workflowSupplementary material Fig. 1 describes the workflow scheme.Figure 1The (A) ROC and (B) PR curves of the models in predicting the occurrence of MCE on the test set.Full size imageData preprocessingWe used a data-splitting approach to validate our findings. As per the studies conducted by Dobbin and Simon17 and Nguyen et al.18, a train-test splitting ratio of around 30% is considered reasonable. To provide an unbiased evaluation of the model fit on the training dataset while fine-tuning model hyperparameters, we also held out about 15% of the training set as a validation set. We randomly divided the total sample into three sets—a training set (60%), a validation set (10%), and a test set (30%), each stratified based on their MCE status to ensure an equal balance between groups. We then transformed the raw data into a valuable and efficient format: missing values were kept at an "Unknown" level, categorical variables were converted into dummy variables, and the continuous variable (age) was centralized and standardized. The variable imbalances between sets were evaluated using standardized mean differences and differences in proportion. A strict threshold of 0.05 was applied to indicate significant imbalances between the groups19.Variable selectionWe utilized the training and validation sets for variable selection. We modeled the outcome as a function of all predicting variables using Random Forest, which generated a list of importance rankings based on the Gini index. Next, we applied the Random Forest algorithm and tenfold cross-validation to calculate the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AU-ROC). We progressively included variables from the list, starting with the highest rank, until we reached a saturation threshold of AU-ROC variance ≤ 1% for two consecutive iterations.Generating weighted scoresLogistic Regression was applied to generate weighted scores, modeling MCE as a function of the chosen variables. Each variable’s β coefficient was divided by the lowest β coefficient and rounded to the nearest value. The sum of scores for each category gave the total score normalized to a range of 0–100 for practicality, with 100 representing the highest risk for MCE and 0 denoting a zero risk.Model evaluationWe evaluated the weighted scores' ability to predict MCE via four methods: Penalized Logistic Regression (PLR), Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Random Forest (RF), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). We employed a stratified ten-fold cross-validation for each predictive model to select the ideal hyperparameter combination using grid search, then trained each model individually.Evaluation metricsWe developed Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC), Precision-Recall (PR), and Gain curves for each prediction model to evaluate the performance of the four algorithms on the test dataset. We employed six traditional metrics (AU-ROC, Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve [AU-PRC], sensitivity, specificity, precision, and F1 score) to generate predicted classes. Then, we determined point-estimated metrics by cross-tabulating the observed and predicted classes. We selected the best model based on the best performance in the ROC and PR spaces20.Data analysisAll analyses were conducted using was performed in R (version 4.2.1) using RStudio IDE (RStudio 2022.02.1.461 “Prairie Trillium” Release).Ethics approval and participation consentAll participants provided informed consent for data, sample collection, and medical record screening per the local Research Ethics Boards' requirements. The Research Ethics Boards approved the protocol of participating institutions (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01517191).ResultsThe original dataset enrolled 24,068 participants; 12,954 (53.8%) had laboratory-confirmed influenza infections. Supplementary Table 1 presents the overall characteristics of the study population and indicates no significant differences (above the 0.05 threshold) among the three datasets (training, validation, and test sets).Variable selection and weightingSupplementary Figs. 3 and 4 indicate that a list of importance rankings based on the Gini index was observed for the predicting variables and the cumulative ten-fold cross-validated AU-ROC estimates until reaching the saturation threshold for two consecutive iterations. This led us to select ten variables from four domains: demographic (age and sex), health history (smoking status, chronic pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, and influenza vaccination status), clinical presentation (cough, sputum production, and shortness of breath), and function (need for regular support for activities of daily living). Table 1 displays the resulting scale and its weighted scores. The scale displayed a right-skewed distribution (Supplementary Fig. 2A), with a median value of 39 across all participants (1st–3rd quartile, 23–59), and no differences between women and men (Supplementary Fig. 2B).Table 1 The Influenza Severity Scale (ISS).Full size tableComparing performance across different modelsTable 2 reveals similar accuracy of predictive models on the training set, with minor disparities in AU-ROC. We chose not to exclude any models before assessing their performance on the test set. Figure 1 displays the ROC and PR curves of the prediction models on the test set, with individual ROC and gain curves in the Supplementary material (Figs. 5–8). Results show that all models had acceptable discrimination performance, ranging from 69.2 to 73.1% in AU-ROC, similar to those in their training set. Examining the ROC and PR curves, the Penalized Logistic Regression and eXtreme Gradient Boosting models demonstrate the best overall performance when using the ISS as a continuous variable.Table 2 Performance of the models in predicting the occurrence of MCE on the train and test sets.Full size tableFinding the optimal cutoff pointsWhen tested on the set, the ISS attained a remarkable AU-ROC of 0.73 (95% CI, 0.71–0.74). When applying the Youden index to determine the optimal score threshold, it revealed a value of ≥ 37, leading to a sensitivity of 0.70 (95% CI, 0.68–0.72) and a specificity of 0.63 (95% CI, 0.60–0.65). To interpret the scores simpler, Supplementary Table 2 provides a conversion table that maps the cutoff values to their respective predicted risks and performance metrics. For further simplification, the scores were aggregated into three categories: low risk (ISS < 30; sensitivity 79.9% [95% CI, 78–81.7%], specificity 51% [95% CI, 48.6–53.3%]), moderate risk (ISS ≥ 30 but < 50; 54.5% sensitivity, 55.9% specificity) and high risk (ISS ≥ 50; sensitivity 51.4% [95% CI, 49.3–53.6%], specificity 80.5% [95% CI, 78.7–82.4%]; Fig. 2).Figure 2The histogram of the ISS scores by risk categories overlaps a density plot by the outcome MCE. Sturges’ Rule determined the optimal number of bins.Full size imageDiscussionThis study demonstrates the development and assessment of accuracy for the Influenza Severity Scale. This 10-item scale was designed to differentiate patients infected with influenza by their risk of experiencing major clinical events. The ISS is based on simple, easily accessible data and discriminates accurately. This emphasizes the utility of the ISS for both retrospective and prospective studies in accurately assessing and predicting influenza-related outcomes.Adams and colleagues reviewed common severity assessments for influenza and community-acquired pneumonia7. They examined 118 studies focusing on influenza, which included evaluations of tools such as PSI, CURB 65, APACHE II, SOFA, and qSOFA21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35. The clinical outcomes studied in these assessments involved mortality rates (overall, in ICU, in hospital), ICU admissions, mechanical ventilation needs, length of hospital stays, and total hospitalizations. Despite the extensive findings, none of the assessments were specifically designed for influenza or considered other critical outcomes like admission to intermediate care units or the need for oxygen therapy or non-invasive ventilation. Additionally, significant differences were observed in the clinical parameters and research endpoints across the studies reviewed. These variations made it challenging to combine results and perform a meta-analysis accurately. Consequently, it hindered the authors from making precise evaluations of diagnostic performance and conducting direct comparisons between different assessment tools.Nevertheless, although PSI and CURB-65 are generally reliable in predicting 30-day mortality rates for community-acquired pneumonia in different clinical settings, some studies suggest that they may not be effective in predicting mortality rates for influenza pneumonia cases. For example, in a study conducted by Riquelme et al.36, these pneumonia scoring systems were ineffective in predicting the survival rate of low-risk patients with the H1N1 2009 influenza pandemic. Another study revealed that these scoring systems are still inefficient for the influenza pandemic because they cannot accurately predict the need for intensive care services37. The study revealed promising findings for SMRT-CO in identifying low-risk patients, with an AU-ROC of 0.82637.In contrast, other studies found that the AU-ROC values for predicting mortality in patients with influenza A were 0.777 for CURB-65 and 0.560 for PSI22. This study proposed the FluA-p score as a novel approach to predict mortality in patients with influenza A-related pneumonia, achieving an AU-ROC of 0.90822. However, despite its high AU-ROC, the FluA-p score relies on laboratory variables as risk parameters, similar to the SOFA score. This reliance may present challenges when incorporating it into environments with limited resources or assessing severity in epidemiological studies that often lack access to laboratory data.When analyzing medical research data with categorical outcomes, it's crucial to consider performance metrics. While the ROC curve is commonly used to assess test performance, dealing with imbalanced datasets can distort results. Combining ROC and Precision-Recall (PR) curves along with their respective AUC measurements (AU ROC and AU PR) is recommended to address this issue. Surprisingly, PR curves are often overlooked in diagnostic performance studies in influenza patients. To fill this gap, we assessed ISS's discriminative ability using ROC and PR curves. The ISS demonstrated strong discriminative performance in the test set, achieving AU ROC and AU PR values exceeding 70%. Remarkably, these results were achieved without using any laboratory parameters and by including patients from various sites to minimize bias stemming from local practices.Estimating disease severity involves assessing the probability of significant clinical events among those individuals who are at risk but have not yet experienced any at the start of the observation period. This probability is determined by a set of parameters, some of which can be modified while others cannot. The severity assessment must consider modifiable and non-modifiable parameters, with the latter being the most important. Modifiable parameters may not always lead to a decrease in the risk of clinical events, but they can indicate how an intervention, disease progression, or host response will affect the baseline risk. Even if the modifiable parameters do not indicate a high risk, this does not necessarily mean the individual's baseline risk has changed. Instead, it reflects the natural history of the disease and how it interacts with the host. Therefore, individuals must be stratified based on modifiable and non-modifiable risks. Our tool considers this, allowing us to gain insight into the progression of the disease and the host's response to the infection. At the same time, it recognizes and respects the individual's particularities and dynamic responses.To ensure the most effective risk management strategies, ISS utilizes a 3-threshold system to differentiate between low- and high-risk patients when measuring the likelihood of major clinical events. These thresholds were specifically chosen to ensure a high sensitivity and specificity rate exceeding 80%. This 3-tier system facilitates risk-based treatment protocols and permits a more centralized and cost-effective care distribution. For medical personnel, this allows for treatments and services to be tailored to the specific needs of patients, enabling higher-quality care and more successful patient outcomes. During epidemiological studies, the use of ISS enables the identification of the disease severity and its association with a particular strain. It can also be used as an adjustment measure when assessing the effectiveness of interventions.Our study has several limitations that must be considered. Firstly, the data we used was obtained from hospital surveillance, which inherently limits our ability to account for specific institutional protocols. Our data consisted of the initial assessment of the patient within the hospital, which reflects the patient’s condition immediately after being hospitalized. While using this approach, we might have lost the ability to capture the scale’s performance in predicting the need for hospitalization. However, we could still track all significant clinical events that occurred afterward. Also, we have not had lower tract samples, meaning we may not have identified some people with severe disease, thus skewing the results. Moreover, our tool's reliance on non-modifiable parameters limits its capacity to be used as an evolutionary or responsive variable during hospitalization, as it does not concentrate on physiological parameters. Unsurprisingly, the absence of modifiable parameters, such as vital signs, laboratory, and radiological variables, impacted the discriminatory performance of our tool. Future studies should include these variables to enhance its performance while ensuring a balance with non-modifiable parameters. Some rare characteristics are likely underrepresented in our cohort, leading to an insufficient data sample to identify them as significant factors influencing ISS. Nonetheless, they could be relevant in other settings, also warranting further validation. Lastly, ISS comprises ten variables and individual scores, which can be challenging to remember in clinical practice. Ideally, future work could focus on developing automated means of collecting and calculating the ISS to support its use in research and clinical settings. Despite these drawbacks, our dataset was sizeable, multi-centric, and included a wide variety of people who are generally not included in these kinds of studies, such as individuals on the extremes of age with or without comorbidities.In summary, the ISS is a tool used to assess the severity of influenza infection. It considers the patient's symptoms and non-modifiable parameters to predict the likelihood of MCE without requiring lab tests other than confirming influenza infection. This can help direct protocols and policies to those at greater risk of MCE, such as older adults, women, smokers, CPD patients, diabetics, and those not vaccinated against influenza. It also highlights the importance of considering multiple factors (and their intersection) contributing to a person's risk rather than individual factors considered singly.Additionally, the tool can raise awareness of important symptoms that predict worse outcomes, namely (in order of importance) shortness of breath, sputum production, and coughing, as well as important clinical features such as underlying health conditions and functional status. Notably, the most important clinical factors identified here were underlying chronic lung disease, shortness of breath, and baseline functional impairment with the requirement for support in activities of daily living. These are relevant and readily identifiable factors that impact clinical prognostication and decision-making. For example, a 70-year-old patient with baseline functional impairment who presents with shortness of breath is at high risk for MCE from influenza, and this can be communicated to the patient and family early in their admission.We believe ISS will be essential for public health systems to monitor the effects of public health protocols on clinical outcomes and establish efficient surveillance measures. Further research is necessary to explore the utility of ISS in different clinical settings and its capacity to predict mortality. Ultimately, the ISS may prove to be a valuable metric for assessing and improving influenza-related health outcomes, contributing to the betterment of public health.

The IRAT does not assess the immediate risk to the public's health and does not predict future flu pandemics. A new IRAT evaluation was done on a virus from the ongoing U.S. 2024 H5N1 bird flu outbreak in poultry and dairy cows, with some sporadic human infections. Data associated with this virus was compared to data from other Influenza viruses using the IRAT to score the future potential of this virus to cause a pandemic. The IRAT score of the currently circulating H5N1 bird flu confirms that this virus poses a potential public health risk, comparable to other moderate risk Influenza A viruses. The current risk to individual and population health remains low. Summary What CDC knows An IRAT is used to evaluate the future pandemic potential of an influenza A virus currently circulating in animals. Experts review data and score a representative flu virus based on the likelihood that the virus may gain the ability to spread easily from person-to-person. Experts also score the virus on the impact that it could have on public health. IRAT scores may be updated when there are important changes to virus characteristics, like the ability to infect a new kind of animal or human. What CDC is doing CDC issued a new IRAT report on a virus from the current U.S. 2024 H5N1 bird flu outbreak which indicates the virus has a moderate future potential pandemic risk when compared to other Influenza A viruses. This information is used to guide preparedness planning. CDC believes that the current risk to the public's health from this virus is low. CDC continues to work with USDA, FDA, and state health departments to monitor and test people who have been exposed to infected or potentially infected animals. The IRAT is used for evaluation of flu viruses The Influenza Risk Assessment Tool (IRAT) was created by CDC and U.S. government experts for use in flu pandemic preparedness. The IRAT seeks expert opinion to score several characteristics of a representative influenza A virus. Together these scores indicate the likelihood that a virus will gain the ability to spread from person-to-person and the potential public health impact if that were to happen. The IRAT is used to plan for, not to predict, the next pandemic. It does not calculate the immediate or current risk to the general public. CDC uses this tool as a part of its ongoing public health work. This analysis, which includes data through June 26, did not include the 10 human infections that occurred in Colorado in July following exposure to infected poultry (9 cases) and dairy cows (1 case). All were associated with mild illness and a majority experienced conjunctivitis. The IRAT seeks to answer two questions about a flu virus An IRAT evaluation is done when a non-human flu virus that can spread to people appears or has changed in some way. The IRAT seeks to answer the following two questions: Emergence: What is the risk that the flu virus will emerge to spread from person-to-person? Public health impact: If that were to happen, what would the impact be on public health? The IRAT considers multiple risk elements to measure potential pandemic risk There are three overarching categories with 10 risk elements that measure the potential flu pandemic risk. These are: The properties of the virus, including genomic analysis, type of host and tissues and cells that the virus is best matched to, the ability of the virus to spread efficiently in animal studies, and the predicted effectiveness of available antiviral medications. Population attributes, including whether there is existing immune protection in people, the severity of illness caused by the virus in people and animals, and how similar the virus in question is to currently available seasonal flu vaccines, candidate vaccine viruses, or stockpiled pre-pandemic vaccines. Ecologic and Epidemiologic factors, including how widespread the virus is in animals, the kinds of animals that are impacted, the likelihood of human contact, and the frequency of human infections. CDC and other U.S. government flu experts score these elements to estimate potential pandemic risk. A score is given for potential emergence risk, potential impact risk, and also an overall summary score. The scores fall within one of three groups: Low risk (point score between 1.0 – 3.9); Moderate risk (point score between 4 – 7.9); High risk (point score between 8.0 – 10.0). Because these scores can involve a degree of subjectivity, flu experts provide a range of acceptable scores for each risk element. Then each risk element is weighted based on its importance in answering the questions about emergence and public health impact. From there, the scores are ranked and compared to the potential pandemic risk of other influenza A viruses. The IRAT is designed to be flexible and responsive, so sometimes the rank of risk elements may change, other risk elements can be added, and others can be dropped. The IRAT is not a predictive tool The IRAT does have some limitations. It often relies on data that are scarce or preliminary. Also, it is subjective and relies heavily on expert opinion. It's important to keep in mind that the IRAT does not measure the current risk to the public's health. It focuses on the perceived potential of a flu virus to become a pandemic and the impact that would result if that were to happen. Additionally, the IRAT does not predict future pandemics. The current risk to the general public's health remains low In response to the ongoing U.S. 2024 multistate H5N1 outbreak, characterized by the emergence of H5N1 in a new host (cows), CDC conducted a new IRAT assessment. The most recent IRAT was done on the H5N1 virus isolated from a person in Texas. CDC then wrote up a report summarizing the results. CDC has done several of these assessments around H5 bird flu viruses over the years, as the agency has tracked the emergence and evolution of this group of viruses. The latest IRAT indicates that the overall future potential pandemic risk of H5N1 virus remains moderate and supports the ongoing, coordinated U.S. government response. The current risk to individual and population health remains low. This score has not significantly changed from the most recent assessment done on a similar H5N1 virus that caused an outbreak among mink in Spain in 2023.

This study aims to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of influenza vaccination for HF patients in China. Methods: We developed a Markov model with a 3-month cycle to simulate the cost-effectiveness of administering the influenza vaccine to patients with HF over a 3-year period. Patients in the model received either the influenza vaccine or a placebo, in addition to standard HF treatment. Cost data, sourced from the China Healthcare Statistic Yearbook and other public records, and effectiveness data from the IVVE (Influenza Vaccine to Prevent Adverse Vascular Events in HF) trial, were incorporated. Specifically, the cost of the influenza vaccine was 75 Chinese Yuan (CNY) (11 USD), the cost of hospitalization for heart failure (HHF) was 9,326 CNY (1,386 USD), and the cost of treatment for pneumonia was 5,984 CNY (889 USD). The study’s primary outcome, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), quantifies the incremental cost (CNY and USD) per incremental quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Additional outcomes included total cost, total effectiveness, incremental cost, and incremental effectiveness. We conducted one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) to assess certainty and uncertainty, respectively. Scenario analysis, considering various situations, was performed to evaluate the robustness of the results. Results: In the base case analysis, influenza vaccine, compared to placebo, among Chinese HF patients, resulted in a cost increase from 21,004 CNY (3,121 USD) to 21,062 CNY (3,130 USD) and in QALYs from 1.89 to 1.92 (2.55 life years vs. 2.57 life years) per patient. The resulting ICER was 2,331 CNY (346 USD) per QALY [2,080 CNY (309 USD) per life year], falling below the willingness-to-pay threshold based on per capita GDP. One-way sensitivity analysis revealed that disparities in HHF and cardiovascular death rates between groups had the most significant impact on the ICER, while the cost of vaccines had a marginal impact. PSA and scenario analysis collectively affirmed the robustness of our findings. Conclusion: This study suggests that adding the influenza vaccine to standard treatment regimens for Chinese patients with HF may represent a highly cost-effective option. Further real-world data studies are essential to validate these findings. Introduction Heart failure (HF) is a clinical syndrome characterized by structural and/or functional abnormalities of the heart (1), and HF patients exhibit an elevated propensity for vascular adverse events and other critical comorbidities (2). Although mortality rates have declined in recent years, the incidence of HF is increasing globally, placing a heavy burden on healthcare systems (3), especially in developing country. For instance, the age-standardized prevalence of patients with HF aged 25 years and above in China was recorded as 1.10% in 2017, accounting for a total of 12.1 million patients, and the annual cost per-capita for inpatient and outpatient amounts to $4,406.8 and $892.3, respectively (4). Influenza infection is considered one of the inducing factors for cardiovascular (CV) events in HF patients, augmenting the risk of CV-related mortality, all-cause death, and hospitalization (5, 6). Hence, influenza vaccination may mitigate the risk theoretically, which was also recommended by guideline for decades (7). However, the current clinical evidence remains insufficient. Two meta-analyses suggest that influenza vaccination may reduce the overall mortality risk in HF patients, and one of them found it can also lower CV-related mortality, but both of the included studies were in low certainty of evidence (8, 9). Furthermore, a recent multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial investigated the efficacy of the influenza vaccine in HF patients across 30 international centers, including six in China, which contributed 13.5% of the total study population, making it the third largest participating country (10). The trial demonstrated that vaccination reduced all-cause hospitalizations (hazard ratio [HR] 0.84, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.74–0.97, p = 0.013) and pneumonia incidence (HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.42–0.80, p = 0.0006). Although no significant difference was observed in terms of cardiovascular (CV) events, almost all outcomes in the influenza vaccine group were lower than those in the placebo group. Additionally, studies found that for the older adult, influenza vaccination is associated with direct cost savings and reduced hospitalization rates (11, 12). Therefore, administering the influenza vaccine to HF patients could potentially offer economic advantages as an affordable and straightforward intervention by reducing expenses related to all-cause hospitalizations, incidence of pneumonia, and CV events. Particularly in China, despite recommendations from the local guidelines, the influenza vaccination rates remain significantly low in most cities (13). Therefore, a cost-effective analysis on the expense in influenza vaccination is needed. Based on the trial, this study aims to develop a mathematical model and assess the cost and effectiveness of influenza vaccination for HF patients in China. Methods Model overview We developed a Markov model to assess the cost-effectiveness for Chinese patients with HF. This Markov model has found widespread application in the pharmacoeconomic evaluation of HF patients (14–16). In simple terms, the model comprised five health states: “New York Heart Association (NYHA) I,” “NYHA II,” “NYHA III,” “NYHA IV” and “Dead.” In our study, patients entered the Markov model starting from the same initial health state as in the IVVE (Influenza Vaccine to Prevent Adverse Vascular Events) trial (10), a randomized controlled trial (RCT) investigating the efficacy of influenza vaccine in HF patients. Patients in the Markov model could experience one of five events in each Markov cycle: “Hospitalization for HF (HHF),” “Pneumonia,” “CV death,” “non-CV death” or “No event.” It was assumed that patients who experienced ‘No event’ had the possibility to transition to a better, worse, or remain in the same NYHA classification during the subsequent Markov cycle. However, those who experienced ‘HHF’ could not transition to a better NYHA classification in the subsequent cycle. For example, if a patient was at a NYHA II state and experienced an HHF in the current Markov cycle, they could transition to NYHA II or NYHA III but not to NYHA I in the subsequent 3 months. However, this does not mean they could never transition to NYHA I; they could do so if their HF condition remained stable for 3 months (a Markov cycle). This assumption was in line with common clinical practice and was also used in other health technology assessments for HF treatment (16, 17). Furthermore, patients who experienced CV or non-CV death were directly transitioned to the “Dead” state, effectively exiting the Markov model. Our Markov model simulated the 3-year cost and effectiveness for Chinese HF patients, with a cycle length of 3 months. The schematic diagram of the Markov model is shown in Figure 1. Model building and analyses were performed with TreeAge Pro 2022 (Williamstown, MA, USA). Figure 1 Figure 1. Schematic diagram of the Markov model. HF, heart failure; NYHA, New York Heart Association; HHF, hospitalization for heart failure; CV, cardiovascular. Intervention and control Over three consecutive influenza seasons, participants were administered either a 0.5 mL dose of inactivated influenza vaccine, or a placebo (saline), intramuscularly once a year. The trivalent vaccine (TIV) consisted of 15 μg of haemagglutinin per 0.5 mL dose for each of the two influenza type A subtypes (H1N1 and H3N2), as well as for an influenza type B/Brisbane/60/2008-like virus. Notably, in China, the influenza season typically spans from November to March. Instead of administering the influenza vaccine within the same month each year, participants were given the option to receive it on the appropriate date aligned with the local influenza season. Participants in both groups received standard treatment for HF, in addition to either the influenza vaccine or a placebo. The standard treatment regimen for HF outlined in the China National Heart Failure Guideline 2023 encompasses a multifaceted approach, primarily revolving around several key medications. These include angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitors, β blockers, diuretics, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and sodium and glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors. Additionally, for specific HF subtypes, adjunctive therapies such as digoxin and soluble guanylate cyclase stimulators may also be prescribed. Population The study population comprised Chinese HF patients with baseline characteristics akin to those in the IVVE trial (10). In the IVVE trial, patients had a mean age of 57.2 years, with 51.4% being female, and were predominantly classified as NYHA II (69.5%), with lesser proportions in NYHA III (26.1%) and IV (4.4%). HF with preserved ejection fraction (EF, HFpEF) was observed in 22.6% of patients, while the remaining 77.4% had HF with mildly reduced EF (HFmrEF) or HF with reduced EF (HFrEF). Comparatively, in a study exploring HF prevalence in China, Chinese patients exhibited moderate differences. They were older (63.9 ± 13.2 vs. 57.2 ± 15.3 years) and had higher systolic blood pressure (137.2 ± 22.3 vs. 125.7 ± 23.7 mm Hg) but demonstrated a lower prevalence of hypertension (55.3% vs. 64.9%). However, heart rate, gender distribution, left ventricular function, diabetes, and atrial fibrillation were similar between the cohorts (18). The patients were randomized to allocate to either the influenza vaccine group or the placebo group in a 1:1 ratio. Regardless of their allocation, all patients received standard treatment. In the influenza vaccine group, patients received an annual intramuscular dose of 0.5 mL of inactivated influenza vaccine, which was recommended for the specific influenza season. Alternatively, patients in the placebo group received a saline injection. It’s important to note that the vaccine used during the trial was trivalent, but it is replaced by a quadrivalent vaccine (QIV) currently (10, 19). Input parameters Transition probability The transition probabilities for HHF and CV death were directly obtained from the IVVE trial (10). These probabilities were converted from incidence rates to 3-month transition probabilities using the formula: ‘3-month transition probability = 1 − exp (−3-month rate).’ The 3-month rate was calculated using the formula: ‘3-month rate = −ln (1 − incidence rate)/Period number (Table 1). Employing the aforementioned formulas, we calculated that the 3-month rate for HHF in the vaccine group was 0.015195761, determined as −ln (1 − 334/2,560)/27.6*3, where 334 represented the HHF events in the vaccine group, 2,560 represented the total patients in the vaccine group, 27.6 represented the follow-up period, and 3 represented the cycle length (10). Subsequently, we obtained the 3-month transition probability for HHF, which was 0.015080888, calculated as 1 − exp (−0.015195761), where 0.015195761 represented the 3-month rate for HHF. Similarly, we derived the remaining transition probabilities for HHF and CV death (Supplementary material). Table 1 Table 1. Input parameters in the Markov model. For the transition probability of non-CV death, it was calculated by multiplying the risk ratio (21), which represented the increased risk of non-CV death in HF patients compared to the general population of the same age, with the background mortality of the general population at the same age (20) (Table 1). The background mortality data for the general population was sourced from the China Health Statistical Yearbook 2022, publicly available (20). The transition probabilities between NYHA classifications were accessed from a published study (16) (Table 2). Although there are no patients in the NYHA I state at the initial health state in the Markov model, patients in the NYHA II state have a chance to transition to the NYHA I state in subsequent cycles. Therefore, the health state of NYHA I was included in the Markov model, and its utility was also incorporated into the analysis. Cost The TIV was priced at 75 Chinese Yuan (CNY) (11 USD), while the QIV costed 138 CNY (21 USD). These prices were determined by the rates negotiated with vaccine manufacturers during collective purchasing by the Chinese government, accurately reflecting the actual cost of influenza vaccines for most Chinese people (23). In our base case analysis, we used the cost of the TIV because the QIV was not available in China at the time of the IVVE trial. Additionally, there was a 20 CNY (3 USD) cost for vaccine administration (Table 1). When considering HF-related costs, we included the costs associated with HHF and standard HF treatment. The cost of HHF in China, sourced from the China Healthcare Statistic Yearbook, was reported as 9,326 CNY (1,386 USD) per occurrence, representing the comprehensive costs within the country (20). The cost of standard HF treatment was derived from a national survey of over 50 million individuals, which aimed to investigate the prevalence and economic burden of HF in China. According to the survey, the annual cost of standard HF treatment was 892.3 USD in 2016, which, after adjusting for the exchange rate and healthcare consumer price index (CPI) in China, equated to 7,011 CNY (1,042 USD). The CPI values for the years 2015–2022 were: 1.027, 1.038, 1.06, 1.043, 1.024, 1.018, 1.004, and 1.006, respectively (20). For pneumonia treatment, the total cost for community-acquired pneumonia was reported as 5,683 CNY (844 USD), which inflated to 5,984 CNY (889 USD) in 2022 (22). Costs before 2022 were converted to 2022 values using the healthcare CPI, and future costs were discounted at a rate of 5% (range: 0–8%), according to the China Guidelines for Pharmacoeconomic Evaluations (25). Utility We obtained the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) values for HF patients from a Chinese domestic study (24). This study determined that the HRQoL utility scores for patients categorized by NYHA functional class were as follows: 0.732 for NYHA I, 0.78 for NYHA II, 0.715 for NYHA III, and 0.66 for NYHA IV. Additionally, the disutility associated with HHF or readmission was recorded as −0.1, a value commonly utilized in published research (15, 16) (Table 1). Outcome The primary outcome of the study was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), which represents the incremental cost per incremental effectiveness (measured in quality-adjusted life year, QALY). In the absence of a specific willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold recommended by the Chinese government, we followed the guidance provided in the China Guidelines for Pharmacoeconomic Evaluations (25), which aligned with the recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO). In this context, the influenza vaccine was deemed highly cost-effective when the ICER fell below the per capita gross domestic product (GDP), cost-effective if it was between one to three times the per capita GDP, and not cost-effective if it exceeded three times the per capita GDP (2022). The per capita GDP in China stood at 85,698 CNY (12,734 USD) in 2022. Secondary outcomes encompassed total cost, total effectiveness, incremental cost, and incremental effectiveness. In our base case analysis, we set the starting age at 57 years old to align with the average age in the IVVE trial. Additionally, in the scenario analysis, we considered starting ages of 65, to align with the average age of HF patients in the China Hypertension Survey. Furthermore, we conducted additional scenario analyses to test the robustness of the results. These scenarios involved evaluating the cost-effectiveness of the vaccine in HF patients at the highest price of point and considering an alternative scenario where the HHF rate from the Urban Employee Basic Medical Insurance (UEBMI) scheme was used instead of the data from the IVVE trial (4). Sensitivity and scenario analysis We conducted a one-way sensitivity analysis to evaluate how individual input parameters influenced the ICER. During this analysis, parameters were systematically varied within their 95% CI or predefined ranges. Specifically, for transition probabilities and utilities, we calculated and incorporated the 95% CI into the sensitivity analysis. Meanwhile, for the cost of the vaccine, we utilized the highest and lowest reported values as the range. Regarding the cost of HHF per time and annual standard treatment cost, due to the absence of reported CI or ranges, we employed 0.5 times and 1.5 times the reported costs as lower and higher bounds, respectively. These values were sourced from reputable references such as the China Healthcare Statistic Yearbook or national surveys, aiming to encompass the typical cost spectrum for Chinese HF patients. The results of the one-way sensitivity analysis were visually represented using a tornado diagram. For the probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA), we performed 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations to assess the robustness of our findings. In this analysis, all cost-related parameters were modeled with a gamma distribution, while transition probabilities and utilities were modeled with a beta distribution. Additionally, the relative risk (RR) of non-CV death in HF patients compared to the general population followed a log-normal distribution. The results of the PSA were presented through a scatter plot and a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve. Table 2 Table 2. Transition probabilities of NYHA classifications in the Markov model (every 3 months). Results Base case analysis In our base case analysis, after a 3-year simulation, each Chinese HF patient in the cohort would accumulate approximately 21,004 CNY (3,121 USD) in costs, resulting in an effectiveness of 1.89 QALYs (2.55 life years) with standard treatment. Alternatively, when administering the influenza vaccine alongside standard treatment, the cost would increase slightly to 21,062 CNY (3,130 USD), resulting in an effectiveness of 1.92 QALYs (2.57 life years) within the vaccine group. Comparing the inclusion of the influenza vaccine to standard treatment alone, the ICER amounted to 2,331 CNY (346 USD) per QALY [or 2,080 CNY (309 USD) per life year], which fell below the WTP threshold based on per capita GDP (Table 3).

In scenarios with the highest influenza vaccine costs or a starting age set at 65, the ICER remained below 85,698 CNY (12,734 USD) per QALY. When alternative HHF rates were considered, the influenza vaccine showed reduced costs and increased effectiveness (Table 3). Sensitivity analysis and scenario analysis One-way sensitivity analysis revealed that discrepancies in rates of HHF and CV death between groups had the most significant impact on the ICER, but none of the input parameters resulted in an ICER exceeding the WTP threshold of 85,698 CNY (12,734 USD) per QALY (Figure 2). Figure 2 Figure 2. Tornado diagram for ICER of vaccine compared to placebo in Chinese HF patients. The disparities in HHF and CV death rates between groups have the most significant impact on the ICER, but do not exceed 20,000 Chinese Yuan (2,972 USD) per quality-adjusted life year.

Results from the PSA showed that administering the vaccine to Chinese HF patients alongside standard treatment was dominant in 39.9% of cases and highly cost-effective in 56.54% of scenarios. Overall, the vaccine was considered highly cost-effective in at least 96.44% of scenarios (Figure 3). The acceptability curve indicated that at the current WTP threshold of 85,698 CNY (12,734 USD) per QALY, vaccine administration had over 90% acceptability, while standard treatment had less than 10% acceptability (Figure 4).

The WTP threshold where vaccine is more acceptable than standard treatment in Chinese HF patients falls below 5,000 CNY (743 USD) per QALY, and vaccine is more acceptable under the current willingness-to-pay threshold of 85,698 CNY (12,734 USD) per QALY. CNY, Chinese Yuan; QALY, quality-adjusted life year. Discussion In this study, the ICER of the influenza vaccine compared to a placebo for Chinese patients with HF was calculated at 2,331 CNY (346 USD) per QALY [2,080 CNY (309 USD) per life year], falling below the per capita GDP threshold of 85,698 CNY (12,734 USD) per QALY. Additionally, one-way sensitivity analysis revealed that varying parameters within specified ranges did not yield an ICER surpassing the WTP threshold. Moreover, PSA results indicated that incorporating the vaccine into standard HF treatment was highly cost-effective in 96.44% of scenarios. These consistent findings across sensitivity analyses underscore the robustness of this study and underscore the influenza vaccine’s status as a highly cost-effective intervention for Chinese HF patients. In the IVVE trial, although the influenza vaccine did not significantly reduce adverse vascular events throughout the entire trial period, it does not negate the cost-effectiveness of vaccination in this economic evaluation. This could be attributed to several reasons: Firstly, in the original study, nearly all outcomes (including all-cause death, CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, all-cause hospitalization, HHF, and pneumonia) except for non-fatal stroke were lower in the influenza vaccine group compared to the placebo group, with only all-cause hospitalization and pneumonia showing statistical significance. These observed synergistic effects may enhance vaccine effectiveness. Secondly, when considering only periods during peak influenza circulation, a significant decrease in all-cause death, CV death, and pneumonia was observed in the vaccine group. On one hand, the reduction of CV events and pneumonia decreased the related costs associated with the vaccine; on the other hand, this reduction also improved effectiveness. These factors collectively contribute to the cost-effectiveness of the influenza vaccine in Chinese HF patients. Furthermore, it should be noted that the influenza vaccine used in the IVVE trial was a TIV, consisting of two strains of influenza A virus (H1N1 and H3N2) and one lineage of influenza B virus (Yamagata or Victoria). The production of this vaccine was undertaken by Sanofi Pasteur Biologics Co., Ltd. at a cost of 75 CNY (11 USD) per dose. Currently, QIV which included an additional strain of influenza B virus absent from TIV, have demonstrated superior protection and paralleled adverse effects globally (26, 27). Similarly, QIV is recommended by The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and likely to be more cost-effective for the elder in China (28). And the QIV produced by Sanofi Pasteur incurs higher cost at 138 CNY (21 USD) per dose. As depicted in scenario 1, the highest price was set at 138 CNY (21 USD) per dose, which currently stands as the most expensive TIV available in China, resulting in an ICER with 8,869 CNY (1,318 USD) per QALY [7,914 CNY (1,176 USD) per life year], lower than WTP. Therefore, if using QIV under current circumstances in China, vaccination is also highly cost-effective even with higher cost. Currently, the influenza vaccination rate in China was not optimistic. First, vaccination policies have a significant impact on vaccination rates. For instance, in the United States, universal vaccination is recommended for all individuals (29), whereas in most countries, it is only advised for those susceptible to influenza. In China, high-risk groups are defined as individuals aged 60 and above, children under 5 years old, pregnant women, and people with chronic illnesses. In fact, a Chinese national cross-sectional survey conducted in 2014–2015, encompassing a sample of 74,484 individuals aged over 40 years old, revealed that the influenza vaccination rate among individuals with chronic diseases was merely 4.0% (30). Secondly, there were significant variations in vaccination rates across different regions within China, which were caused by economic gap. For instance, the eastern region exhibited a higher vaccination rate compared to the western region (26.1% vs. 6.7%) (31, 32). In addition, as influenza vaccinations are predominantly not covered by mandatory health insurance schemes, local reimbursement ratio could also influence the vaccination rate (33). Such as Shenzhen city, the government fully covered the reimbursement for influenza vaccination in elder above 60 years old; however, in Guangzhou, a similarly developed city, reimbursement was funded through the surplus of Basic Social Medical Insurance for Urban Employees and the vaccination rate was lower. At the same time, relevant medical authorities have also implemented novel measures to bolster vaccination rates. A study has revealed that video-based education represents an effective and feasible approach for improving older individuals’ willingness and uptake of influenza vaccination (34). And interestingly, a pragmatic trial has suggested that a pay-it-forward intervention, which provides complimentary influenza vaccines along with an opportunity to contribute financially toward supporting the immunization of other individuals, could augment influenza uptake (35). The prevalence of HF patients in China is substantial, imposing a significant burden. It is worth noting that there is a dearth of cost–benefit analyses pertaining to vaccination for HF patients in China. Meanwhile, several studies have conducted cost–benefit analyses on vaccination for older adult individuals in China (36, 37), yielding similar outcomes. Given the considerable overlap between the HF and older adult populations, it could be inferred that vaccination may be cost-effective in HF patients and exhibit enhanced efficacy, which was consistent with our findings. Overall, vaccination is a highly cost-effective intervention for HF patients, and recommended for widespread adoption among the population. Despite the gradual increase in vaccination rates in China over the past years, it remains a formidable challenge for relevant departments to augment vaccination coverage to align with that of developed nations, necessitating further concerted efforts. This study has several limitations. Firstly, the study employed a simple Markov model based on the IVVE trial. This model considered vaccination as a static process and did not account for varying vaccination rates, timing, herd immunity effects, or adherence to vaccination schedules. Secondly, despite being a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, the IVVE trial recruited participants from various countries and regions, including Asia. Therefore, the participants in the IVVE trial may not fully represent Chinese patients with HF. Moreover, adverse events in the vaccination group and the control group were also not taken into account, although both groups shared comparable and extremely low incidence of adverse events. Nevertheless, we still hold the belief that this research is useful for policymakers, providing stable and conservative results. Conclusion The findings of this study indicate that influenza vaccination is likely to be a highly cost-effective preventive measure for Chinese HF patients, thus warranting its widespread adoption among this patient population.

Morten Just/Flickr cc The latest confirmations are from Colorado, South Dakota, and Texas. In other updates, APHIS also reported more detections in wild birds in mammals. The group reported about more than 100 more H5N1 detections in wild birds across several states. Some were waterfowl taken by hunters and were sampled last fall. However, several were agency-harvested birds from Colorado's Weld County, which has been a recent hot spot for dairy cow outbreaks, poultry outbreaks, and human illnesses. Species in Weld County that tested positive included doves, sparrows, starlings, and pigeons.Regarding mammals, APHIS over the past few days has reported 27 more detections, raising its confirmed number to 373. Most of the newly confirmed positives involve deer mice and house mice from Weld County in Colorado. The group also included three domestic cats from Larimer County in Colorado, plus a rabbit and a vole from Weld County. After pandemic, school openings linked to poor mental health News brief Stephanie Soucheray, MA Topics COVID-19 While many studies have shown that COVID-19 pandemic-era school closures had negative effects on student mental health, a new study in JAMA Network Open shows the opposite: the re-opening of schools trigged an increased incidence of acute psychiatric emergencies, suggesting school can be a substantial source of stress for some students. The study is based on 13,014 psychiatric emergency department (ED) visits at 9 university hospitals in Italy from January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2021.The number of ED visits increased across the study period. The authors found school opening, but not social lockdown restrictions, were associated with an increase in the number of ED psychiatric visits (incidence rate ratio [IRR]1.29; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.23 to 1.34).Eating disorders, suicide attempts increased For psychiatric visits overall, there was a notable increase in both females (IRR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.25 to 1.33) and males (IRR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.14 to 1.2).Three areas of mental health saw the biggest jump in ED visits during the study period: eating disorders (increase of 294.8%), suicidal ideation (297.8%), and suicide attempt (249.1%).For some students, the avoidance of stress-provoking social situations in school may translate into a temporary relief when school is closed" For some students, the avoidance of stress-provoking social situations in school may translate into a temporary relief when school is closed," the study authors wrote. "The lack of habituation to managing social stress during school closure may then be associated with greater distress upon school reopening. Possible stress from risk of contagion upon returning to school is another factor to consider." PAHO upgrades Oropouche virus risk, probes more fetal deaths News brief Lisa Schnirring Topics Oropouche Virus The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) recently issued an epidemiological alert for rising Oropouche virus infections, urging countries to step up surveillance amid spread to new areas, reports of the first deaths, and suspected maternal transmission. Halfpoint / iStock Oropouche virus is typically spread by a species of biting midge called Culicoides paraensis, but multiple factors including climate change, deforestation, and urbanization have contributed spread beyond Brazil's Amazon region to countries that haven't reported cases before, including Bolivia and Cuba.Since the first of the year, 8,078 cases have been reported from five countries, mostly from Brazil. The others include Bolivia, Peru, Colombia, and Cuba. Two deaths have been reported, both from Brazil. Both of the fatal cases occurred in young women who didn't have underlying health conditions.Brazilian officials are investigating a link between Oropouche virus and poor fetal outcomes. So far, the country has reported one fetal death, a miscarriage, and four newborns with microcephaly. The country is also investigating three more possible cases of maternal transmission, all involving fetal deaths reported from Pernambuco state. In one of the three cases, the Oropouche virus genome was detected in fetal tissue and blood samples.In an updated risk assessment, PAHO said the investigation into the rise in activity is still underway and the trajectory is unknown. However, it upgraded the risk for the region to high based on a moderate level of confidence.European countries report 10 imported casesIn a related development, three countries in Europe have now reported 10 imported Oropouche virus cases, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) said in its latest weekly communicable disease update. Italy and Spain had reported earlier cases, and now Germany has also reported two similar illnesses. Nine cases involved people who visited Cuba, and one person had traveled to Brazil. The ECDC said the risk to European travelers is low if they protect themselves from midges or mosquitoes that spread the virus. It also added the risk of local spread in Europe is low, due to the absence of competent vectors. Cambodia reports second H5N1 case in less than a week News brief Lisa Schnirring Topics Avian Influenza (Bird Flu) Cambodia's health ministry on August 3 announced a second human H5N1 avian influenza in less than a week, which involves a 16-year-old girl who is hospitalized in serious condition, according to a statement translated and posted by Avian Flu Diary, an infectious disease news blog. Leo Malsam / iStock The girl is from the same province (Svay Rieng), but a different town, as a case announced earlier in the week.About 4 days before her symptoms began, she touched and held dead chickens that died at her house and her neighbor's house. The girl's illness marks Cambodia's ninth case this year. So far, the clade isn't known, but the country's earlier cases were linked to an older 2.3.2.1c clade that circulates in some Asian countries, including Cambodia. Since early 2023, Cambodia has reported a rise in H5N1 infections, which are often severe of fatal. The country has now reported 15 cases since February 2023. Study suggests preventive vancomycin cuts C diff risk in stem cell transplant patients News brief Chris Dall, MA Topics Antimicrobial Stewardship CDC / Melissa Eckert A single-center study found that giving hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients preventive doses of oral vancomycin was associated with a significant decrease in the risk of Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), researchers reported today in Antimicrobial Stewardship & Healthcare Epidemiology.Because of their immunocompromised state, HSCT patients have a nine-fold increased risk of CDI compared with the general population. To reduce this risk, the bone marrow transplant team at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJUH) in New Jersey implemented a protocol in December 2019 for universal oral vancomycin prophylaxis (OVP) for all patients undergoing HSCT. Prior to this protocol, the decision to use OVP was made by the provider and was not routine.To assess the effectiveness of the OVP protocol, researchers with RWJUH and Rutgers University reviewed the medical records of all HSCT patients admitted from January 2015 through August 2022. The primary end point was the incidence of in-hospital CDI. Secondary endpoints included incidence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and gram-negative bloodstream infections, hospital survival, and length of hospital stay.Promising results, but clinical trials neededA total of 156 HSCT patients met inclusion criteria, with 75 in the pre-universal prophylaxis era (no OVP) and 81 in the post-universal prophylaxis era (OVP). The most common indicators for transplant were multiple myeloma, acute myeloid leukemia, and Hodgkin lymphoma. Among the 81 patients in the OVP group, there was 1 (1.23%) case of CDI, compared with 8 (10.67%) of 75 in the no OVP group. No positive VRE cultures were found in either group. There were no significant between-group differences in the incidence of gram-negative bloodstream infections, hospital survival, and length of stay. "These findings are promising considering infections such as CDI are among the most common complications affecting HSCT patients," the study authors wrote. But they caution that more research is needed to better understand the potential implications of using OVP on HSCT patients' enteric microbiota, increased VRE colonization, and the risk of the emergence of vancomycin-resistant C difficile strains."Prospective clinical trials and cost-effectiveness studies are needed to more definitively assess the safety and efficacy of this practice," they concluded.These findings are promising considering infections such as CDI are among the most common complications affecting HSCT patients.

Rich1,2,3 Show authors Journal of Exposure Science & Environmental Epidemiology (2024)Cite this article 782 Accesses 2 Altmetric Metrics details AbstractBackgroundInfluenza healthcare encounters in adults associated with specific sources of PM2.5 is an area of active research.ObjectiveFollowing 2017 legislation requiring reductions in emissions from light-duty vehicles, we hypothesized a reduced rate of influenza healthcare encounters would be associated with concentrations of PM2.5 from traffic sources in the early implementation period of this regulation (2017–2019).MethodsWe used the Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS) to study adult patients hospitalized (N = 5328) or treated in the emergency department (N = 18,247) for influenza in New York State. Using a modified case-crossover design, we estimated the excess rate (ER) of influenza hospitalizations and emergency department visits associated with interquartile range increases in source-specific PM2.5 concentrations (e.g., spark-ignition emissions [GAS], biomass burning [BB], diesel [DIE]) in lag day(s) 0, 0–3 and 0–6. We then evaluated whether ERs differed after Tier 3 implementation (2017–2019) compared to the period prior to implementation (2014–2016).ResultsEach interquartile range increase in DIE in lag days 0–6 was associated with a 21.3% increased rate of influenza hospitalization (95% CI: 6.9, 37.6) in the 2014–2016 period, and a 6.3% decreased rate (95% CI: −12.7, 0.5) in the 2017–2019 period. The GAS/influenza excess rates were larger in the 2017–2019 period than the 2014–2016 period for emergency department visits. We also observed a larger ER associated with increased BB in the 2017–2019 period compared to the 2014–2016 period.Impact statementWe present an accountability study on the impact of the early implementation period of the Tier 3 vehicle emission standards on the association between specific sources of PM2.5 air pollution on influenza healthcare encounters in New York State. We found that the association between gasoline emissions and influenza healthcare encounters did not lessen in magnitude between periods, possibly because the emissions standards were not yet fully implemented. The reduction in the rates of influenza healthcare encounters associated with diesel emissions may be reflective of past policies to reduce the toxicity of diesel emissions. Accountability studies can help policy makers and environmental scientists better understand the timing of pollution changes and associated health effects.

Although influenza rates were much lower during COVID-19, influenza remains a relevant seasonal respiratory infection as influenza rates have returned to pre-COVID rates after the acute phase of the COVID pandemic [2]. While the association between influenza and increased concentrations of PM2.5 has been reported by several groups previously [3,4,5,6], the association between constituent sources of PM2.5 and influenza is an area of active research. In our prior accountability study in New York State, we observed an increase in the relative rate of emergency department visits for influenza associated with an increased concentration of gasoline and diesel PM2.5 concentrations. This potential increase in the toxicity per unit mass in the setting of fuel regulations and decreasing particulate pollution highlighted the need for ongoing evaluation of complex health responses to atmospheric exposures [7].As described previously [3, 8], a series of energy and vehicle related regulations were enacted including spanning coal-fired power plant closures, sulfur reduction in diesel for trucks, and now the more recent 2017 implementation of the tier 3 vehicle standards [9]. These Tier 3 standards, will reduce the average sulfur content of gasoline from 30 parts per million (ppm) to 10 ppm and also when fully phased in, will lead to a 70% reduction in the per-vehicle particulate matter standard for light to medium duty vehicle tailpipe emissions [10]. The updated Non-methane Organic Gases (NMOG) and NOx tailpipe emissions were set at 30 milligrams per mile (mg/mi) for model year 2025. Overall, the Tier 3 standards will match the California’s Super Ultra Low Emission Vehicle (SULEV) program so that the same cars can be sold in all 50 states in the U.S. [10].In this study we again examined associations between influenza hospitalizations and emergency department visits associated with source-specific PM2.5 concentrations, specifically comparing these associations before and after Tier 3 vehicle emissions implementation on January 1, 2017.While many PM2.5 constituents decreased from 2005 to 2013, secondary organic carbon (SOC) increased in the 2014–2016 period and has remained at relatively constant concentrations in the 2017–2019 period across all sites in New York State (NYS) [11]. Therefore, we also examined two forms of organic carbon, primary organic carbon (POC) and SOC. POC is directly emitted by a source and is commonly a combustion product while SOC is an atmospheric oxidation product of volatile organic compounds. The oxidative potential (ability to generate oxidative stress in the body) of SOC is greater than POC [12, 13]. The majority of PM2.5 is a combination of secondary inorganic aerosol (SIA; secondary nitrate [SN] and secondary sulfate [SS]) and secondary organic aerosols (SOA; e.g. secondary organic carbon). The fact that SOC concentrations did not fall in the 2017–2019 period raises the possibility of a sustained risk of influenza across periods due to SOC’s ability to disrupt the innate immune response to infection [14]. In our prior study of the difference in rates of influenza healthcare encounters associated with source-specific PM2.5 from 2005 to 2016 in adult New York State residents we observed an increase in the rate of healthcare encounters associated with influenza associated with interquartile range (IQR) increases in multiple source specific PM2.5 constituents including diesel, spark-ignition (gasoline) and biomass burning [7]. While SOC and POC were not included in this prior study the increased concentration of SOC and its potential health risk warranted the inclusion of both SOC and POC in the current study.In this study, we examined whether the association between short term increases in ambient source-specific PM2.5 concentrations and influenza healthcare visits differed between the period prior to Tier 3 implementation (2014–2016) and the initial years of Tier 3 implementation (2017–2019). We hypothesized that the Tier 3 standards could result in a lower relative rate of hospitalization or emergency department visits for influenza associated with increased light-duty vehicle (gasoline), compression-ignition, heavy-duty diesel vehicle, and SOC PM2.5 concentrations in the 2017–2019 period compared to 2014–2016.MethodsStudy populationRespiratory infection hospital admissions and emergency department visits for adult New York residents (age > 18) were obtained from the Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS) database. In total, N = 135,236 hospitalizations and N = 549,528 emergency department visits of adults living within 15 miles of the Buffalo, Rochester, Albany, Bronx, Manhattan, or Queens PM2.5 monitoring sites from January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2019, were retained. These monitoring sites were selected since they collect the PM2.5 samples for speciation analysis. We included participants with a primary diagnosis (at time of healthcare encounter) of influenza (ICD9 = 4870, 4871, 48811, 48812, 48881, 48882; ICD10 = J09X1, J09X2, J1000, J1001, J1008, J101, J1100, J1108 and J111. In the analysis, we paired pollution to the healthcare encounter in the same day (lag 0), prior 4 days (lag day 0–3) and prior 7 days (lag days 0–6). Given the vast majority (95%) of patients with influenza will become symptomatic within the first 2 days of infection [15], and then present for a healthcare encounter sometime in the next week (if at all), the 0–6 day lag period (7 days prior to presentation) may represent the exposure closest to the start of the influenza infection. While there is variability in when patients present for care after the start of symptoms, lag day 0 (same day) and lag days 0–3 are likely representative of exposure several days into influenza infection. For this reason, we focus our discussion on the associations at the 0–6 lag days (closest to the start of infection) and less so on the shorter lags. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University at Albany, State University of New York.Air pollution and meteorology measurementsWe obtained PM2.5 compositional data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Chemical Speciation Network (www.epa.gov/aqs). In all six urban sites (Buffalo, Rochester, Albany, Manhattan, Bronx and Queens) daily samples were collected and analyzed every third day. Organic carbon, including primary organic carbon (POC) and secondary organic carbon (SOC), was measured every third day using thermo-optical analysis. The PM2.5 sources were identified using EPA positive matrix factorization (PMF) version 5. Further details on this approach can be found in our prior source-specific analyses by Squizzato et al. [16]. The seven PM2.5 sources included in this study included spark-ignition emissions (GAS), diesel (DIE), biomass burning (BB), road dust (RD), secondary nitrate (SN), secondary sulfate (SS), and pyrolyzed organic rich (OP). Daily ambient temperature and relative humidity were obtained from the National Weather Service.Statistical analysisA time-stratified, case-crossover design [17, 18] was used to estimate the rates of respiratory infection hospital admissions and emergency department visits associated with each interquartile range increase in GAS concentrations on the same day (lag day 0). Assuming a common slope across sites for influenza hospital admissions for all sites, we fit a conditional logistic regression model stratified on each respiratory infection hospital admission matched set (1 case and 3-4 control periods per subject). This conditional logistic regression model regressed case–control status (i.e., case = 1, control = 0) against the mean GAS concentration on case and control days. Since the case-crossover approach controls for non-time-varying confounders, variables such as comorbidities, socioeconomic factors and seasons are all controlled for, by design. However, we included natural splines for temperature and relative humidity (4 degrees of freedom determined using Akaike’s information criterion) [19], and PM2.5 mass of all other sources (i.e., rPM2.5 (residual value) = PM2.5 – GAS). This same model was run for the mean GAS concentrations on lag days 0–3 and 0–6). From each model, we estimated the rate of hospitalizations or emergency department visits associated with each interquartile range increase in GAS concentration. Since we examined 3 lag times for GAS, statistical significance was defined as p < 0.017 (0.05/3), though we focused mainly on the magnitude and direction of the effect estimates rather than the statistical significance. Next, we examined whether the rates of respiratory infection admission associated with each interquartile range increase in GAS concentrations differed by period (2014–2016 and 2017–2019), by adding an interaction term (Period * GAS) to the model. We then re-ran these models for each of the other PM2.5 sources including biomass burning (BB), diesel (DIE), organic-rich phosphate (OP), road dust (RD), secondary nitrate (SN), secondary sulfate (SS) as well as SOC and POC concentrations. For each of these models a rPM2.5 was recalculated and included in the model. For example, the SOC rPM2.5 = PM2.5 – SOC and the RD rPM2.5 = PM2.5 – RD. By computing the residual for all sources, the rate of influenza healthcare encounters associated with a specific PM2.5 source (e.g. GAS) is thus independent of other of the PM2.5 mass from other specific sources (e.g. DIE, BB, SN) [20]. Similarly, the effect of SOC is independent of POC (but not the source-specific PM2.5 such as GAS and BB as these sources can contain SOC). All analyses were completed using R version 3.0.1 (https://www.r-project.org/).ResultsPatients hospitalized for influenza were older (69 years old [SD of 18]) than patients treated and sent home from the emergency department (42 years old [SD of 18] (Table 1). The majority of patients hospitalized or treated in the emergency department were female (58% and 60% respectively) and sought care during the winter months (66% and 69% respectively). While the majority of hospitalized patients were White (62%), the majority of patients treated and sent home from the emergency department were Black (48%).Table 1 Characteristics of respiratory infectious disease hospital admissions and emergency department visits (2014–2019), by study site/city.Full size tablePollution dataUsing Theil-Sen nonparametric estimator and piecewise linear regression, our prior study [21] observed reduction in PM2.5 values across New York State ranging from 5.24% reduction in PM2.5 in Queens (95% CI: −5.61%, −4.39%) to a reduction of 2.51% in Albany (95% CI: −3.43%, −1.32%) from 2010 to 2019. When comparing the 2017–2019 period to the 2014–2016 period in our current study, the median concentration of GAS (2014–2016: 1.04 µg/m3; 2017–2019: 1.7 µg/m3) and SN (2014–2016: 1.3 µg/m3; 2017–2019: 1.8 µg/m3) showed the largest increases (Table 2). DIE (2014–2016: 0.49 µg/m3; 2017–2019: 0.54 µg/m3) and POC (2014–2016: 0.5 µg/m3; 2017–2019: 0.9 µg/m3) had smaller increases in concentrations between periods. We observed a decreased concentration of OP (2014–2016: 0.3 µg/m3; 2017–2019: 0.6 µg/m3), RD (2014–2016: 0.14 µg/m3; 2017–2019: 0.08 µg/m3) and SS (2014–2016: 0.9 µg/m3; 2017–2019: 0.3 µg/m3) in 2017–2019 compared to 2014–2016 and no appreciable change in BB or SOC.Table 2 Distribution of source-specific PM2.5 concentrations (µg/m3), by time period, for case and control periods.Full size tableAs hypothesized, the relative rates of hospital admission from influenza associated with interquartile range increases in DIE were smaller in the 2017–2019 period than the 2014–2016 period at all lag times. Specifically, each 0.3 μg/m3 increase in DIE concentration in the prior 6 days was associated with a 21.3% increased rate of influenza hospitalization (95% CI: 6.9, 37.6) in the 2014–2016 period, but a protective effect (−6.3% rate; 95% CI: −12.7, 0.5) in the 2017–2019 period (Table 3, Fig. 1). A similar pattern was observed for influenza emergency department visits and DIE in the prior 6 days. Specifically, each 0.4 μg/m3 increase in DIE concentration was associated with a 24.6% increased rate of emergency department visits for influenza (95% CI: 14.5, 35.5) in the 2014–2016 period, and a −1.2% rate (95% CI: −4.9, 2.7) in the 2017–2019 period (Table 4, Fig. 2).Table 3 Excess rate of acute hospitalizations for influenza associated with each interquartile range increase in source-specific PM2.5.Full size tableFig. 1: Excess rate of hospitalizations for influenza.Excess rate of hospitalizations for influenza associated with IQR increases in diesel (DIE), biomass burning (BB) and gasoline (GAS) at multiple lag times.Full size imageTable 4 Excess rate of acute emergency department visits for influenza associated with each interquartile range increase in source-specific PM2.5.Full size tableFig. 2: Excess rate of emergency department visits for influenza.Excess rate of emergency department visits for influenza associated with IQR increases in diesel (DIE), biomass burning (BB) and gasoline (GAS) at multiple lag times.Full size imageThe pattern for the association between GAS concentrations and influenza emergency department visits was different from DIE. Each 1.5 μg/m3 increase in GAS concentration was associated with a larger excess rate of influenza emergency department visits in the 2017–2019 period (ER = 23.9%; 95% CI: 17.6, 30.6) than in the 2014–2016 period (ER = 7.7%; 95% CI: 0.1, 15.8) for lag days 0–6, but not for lag day(s) 0 or 0–3 (where no differences were observed between periods) (Table 4, Fig. 2). The rate of influenza hospitalizations associated with each IQR increase in GAS concentration in lag days 0–6 was also larger in the 2017–2019 period (ER = 16.4%; 95% CI: 5.5%, 28.4%) than in the 2014–2016 period (ER = 11.7%; 95% CI: −1.1%, 26.1%).The pattern of ER of biomass burning source-specific PM was the inverse of the DIE results, with no association between BB and influenza hospitalizations in the 2014–2016 period and increased relative rates in the 2017–2019 period at all lag periods. Specifically, each 0.4 μg/m3 increase in BB concentration in lag days 0–6 was associated with a 2.3% increased rate (95% CI: −6.8, 12.3) in the 2014–2016 period, and a 18.7% increased rate of hospitalizations for influenza (95% CI: 12.2, 25.5) in the 2017–2019 period (Table 3, Fig. 1). The pattern for BB/influenza emergency department visits was the same as hospitalizations. We observed a 1.2% increase in emergency department visits (95% CI: −3.3, 5.9) associated with each 0.4 μg/m3 increase in BB in the 2014–2016 period and a 16.8% increase (95% CI: 14.0, 19.7) in the 2017–2019 period (Table 4, Fig. 2).The rate of influenza healthcare encounters associated with increased concentrations of SOC and POC were larger in the 2017–2019 compared to 2014–2016. Each 0.4 μg/m3 increase in POC concentrations in lag days 0–6 was associated with an 11.8% increase in emergency department visits for influenza (95% CI: 8.0, 15.6) in the 2017–2019 period, but only a 1.5% decrease in 2014–2016 (95% CI: −6.2, 3.3) (Table 4). Each 0.7 μg/m3 increase in SOC concentration in lag days 0–6 was associated with a 13.4% increase in emergency department visits for influenza (95% CI: 7.7, 19.3) in the 2017–2019 period and a 1.6% decrease (−6.6, 3.7) in 2014–2016. The difference in the rates between periods was slightly smaller for the hospitalizations for influenza compared to emergency department visits.Similar to SOC and POC, the rate of influenza emergency department visits associated with SN and SS at the 0–6 lag time were larger in the 2017–2019 period compared to 2014–2016 period. One unique finding was the decreased rate of influenza hospitalizations associated with a 1.7 μg/m3 increase in SS at the 0–6 lag period (ER −13.7%; 95% CI: −23.9, −2.2). We observed larger rates of influenza hospitalizations associated with each 0.7 μg/m3 increase in OP concentration in lag days 0–6 in the 2017–2019 period (ER 14.8%; 95% CI: 0.3, 31.4) than the 2014–2016 period (ER of −8.9%; 95% CI: (−17.0, 0.0) at the 0–6 lag days (Table 3). There was no clear pattern of association for road dust and influenza healthcare encounters.DiscussionIn this study of source-specific PM2.5 concentrations and influenza hospitalizations and emergency department visits in Rochester, NY, we estimated and compared the relative rate of influenza healthcare encounters associated with increased source-specific PM2.5, SOC, and POC concentrations both before (2014–2016) and after (2017–2019) Tier 3 vehicle emissions standards were implemented. As hypothesized, we observed a decrease in the rate of influenza hospitalizations and emergency department visits associated with increased DIE concentrations at all lag times in the 2017–2019 period compared to the 2014–2016 period. Unexpectedly, in the 2017–2019 period, we observed an increase in the rate of emergency department visits associated with spark-ignition/gasoline vehicle emissions (GAS) in the prior one week (lag days 0–6; compared to 2014–2016 period) and no change between periods at other lag times. A similar increase in the rate of healthcare encounters for influenza in the 2017–2019 period was observed for biomass burning, SS, POC, and SOC, but not other PM2.5 sources. The relative toxicity per unit mass of some of these PM2.5 sources may have been affected by implementation of the Tier 3 emissions standards and other prior emissions standards.The need to examine the health effects of sources of PM2.5 is supported by our recent study on the effect of total PM2.5 on the rate of influenza healthcare encounters [22]. Despite reductions in overall PM2.5 concentrations during the early implementation period of the Tier 3 standards, the rates of influenza healthcare encounters associated with IQR increases in PM2.5 concentrations were not lower in the 2017–2019 period compared to the 2014–2016 period. As policy makers consider interventions to address specific sources of air pollution, the health effects of the remaining PM2.5 (which has a new relative composition) will require continued assessment.Since the time of our prior study of source-specific PM2.5 and influenza [7] that reported increased rates of influenza hospitalization and emergency department visits associated with increased PM2.5, GAS, and DIE, the global COVID-19 pandemic redirected some of the environmental science community to focus environmental research on COVID-19 infection [23]. The uniqueness of the SARS-CoV-2 infection and its changing pandemic dynamics limited the applicability of the air pollution/COVID-19 studies to other seasonal respiratory viruses [24, 25]. Although there have been several studies estimating influenza/PM2.5 associations [4, 26], there have been few previous studies estimating associations between source-specific PM2.5 or PM2.5 constituents and influenza health care encounters [27]. In the interim from our prior source-specific study, a recent study in Guangdong Province, China observed a 2.8% increase in the relative risk of influenza infection associated with a 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 concentrations in the 8 days prior to symptom onset [6]. Though only indirectly related to respiratory infection, an accountability study in Los Angeles, CA observed a decrease in risks of emergency department visits for asthma associated with increased PM2.5 constituents (organic carbon, sulfate, and nitrate) concentrations over time (2005–2016) [28]. Not all source-specific PM2.5 findings in our current study are consistent with these studies.Our current study employed an improved PMF analysis to better apportion the aerosol resulting in differences between the effect estimates in the 2014–2016 period when comparing with our prior study source-specific/influenza study [7]. In this prior study we examined the association between increased source-specific PM2.5 (using the prior version of the PMF analysis) and influenza healthcare encounters in New York State from the same SPARCS database. Given the volume of data given the inclusion of three periods from 2005 to 2016 and the inclusion of culture negative pneumonia, we did not present the period-specific data in that study (only the total period). While the absolute values are not directly comparable, the trends in excess rates from 2014 to 2019 are important to compare. For example, the excess rates for GAS/influenza healthcare encounters decreased from 2005 to 2007 (ER 17%; 95% CI: 2.7, 33.3) to 2014–2016 (ER 6.1%; 95% CI: −2.4, 9.8) in lag days 0–6 (and similar pattern for lag days 0–3) (unpublished data). In the current study, rather than a trend of smaller excess rates over time, the excess rates for the GAS/influenza emergency department visit associations appeared similar (or larger) in the 2017–2019 period (ER = 23.9%; 95% CI: 17.6, 30.6) compared to the 2014–2016 period (ER 7.7%; 95% CI: 0.1, 15.8) for lag days 0–6.The observation of a similar (or increased) relative rate for healthcare encounters for influenza associated with GAS in the 2017–2019 period compared to 2014–2016, despite the early implementation of the 2017 Tier 3 vehicle standards, is inconsistent with the hypothesis that Tier 3 vehicle standards could have reduced the toxicity per unit mass of the GAS component. Specifically, if the early implementation of the Tier 3 emissions standards decreased the secondary organic carbon (SOC) component of PM2.5, thereby reducing the oxidative potential of PM2.5, we would also expect to see a decrease in the rate of healthcare encounters for influenza associated with increased PM2.5 and GAS concentrations. The lack of reduction in the GAS/influenza association may be related to the incomplete fleet penetration of Tier 3 vehicles. While 36% of the current light duty vehicle fleet was purchased after 2017, we do not yet have data on what proportion of those vehicles met the Tier 3 standards (so the actual Tier 3 market penetration must be roughly 36% or lower) [29]. There may be other explanations including a change in the particle size distribution within GAS. The reduction in the mass of relatively less toxic particles such as secondary sulfate may have led to a relative increase in the toxicity per unit mass of the remaining sources. While the proportion of GAS consisting of UFP increased related in part to the 50% penetrance of gasoline direct injection in 2016, the change in toxicity related to this change will require further study.In our prior study [7], the ERs for the DIE/Influenza emergency department visits were similar in the 2005-2007 period (ER 5.8% [95% CI: 2.6%, 9.0%]) compared to the 2014–2016 period (ER of 6.3% [95% CI 1.3%, 11.6%]) at the 0–6 lag days (unpublished data). In contrast, we observed a substantial decrease in the ER of the DIE/Influenza from 2014–2016 to the 2017–2019 period in the current study. The observed decrease in excess rates of influenza healthcare encounters associated with each 0.3–0.5 μg/m3 increase in DIE may be related to changes prior to the implementation of the 2017 Tier 3 vehicle standard. As a result of multiple diesel fuel related policies targeting the sulfur content of diesel, the concentrations of SO2 (and SS) have decreased [8]. Though NO2 decreased in part due to selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems (required in new vehicles in 2010), the lack of reduction in SN concentrations may be related to an increase in ammonia that escapes the SCR system [30]. Since the Tier 3 vehicle emission standard predominantly addressed gasoline vehicles, it is unclear to what degree the early implementation of this regulation had the potential to reduce the toxicity per unit mass of DIE. Though not guaranteed, the toxicity of both DIE and GAS would be expected to continue to fall, as the emissions from both diesel and gasoline vehicles come below the recommended Tier 3 standard.When considering non-traffic related PM2.5 sources, the increase in the rate of influenza healthcare encounters associated with BB concentrations in the 2017–2019 period, compared to the 2014–2016 period, may be related to a change in the characteristics of wildfire smoke or residential wood-burning smoke and/or their interaction with other pollutants in the outdoor atmosphere. While wildfire smoke has been suggested to comprise up to 25% of PM2.5 in the United States (and up to 50% in the Western U.S.) [31], the majority of BB comes from residential wood burning in the Rochester, NY area [32, 33]. The respiratory health effects of residential biomass burning are particularly difficult to study given the complexity of the factors that determine its emission profile including the condition of the fuel sources, efficiency of burning and ventilation of the indoor space [34]. It remains unclear which, if any, of these variables have changed in NYS to explain a change in relative toxicity in BB from residential wood burning. For wildfire smoke, climate change driven increases in outdoor temperature and reductions in humidity, combined with an increase in large diameter solid fuels (felled trees) due to high winds and draught or flooding is expected to lead to an increase in frequency, intensity and duration of wildfires [35]. Since the proportion of PM2.5 comprised of wildfire/biomass burning increases with further climate change, the reactive potential and toxicity per unit mass of PM2.5 may also increase [36, 37]. However, due to lower average temperature in New York State (NYS) compared to California, where the majority of the U.S. based literature focuses, we would expect less atmospheric reactivity, and potentially less toxicity, during studies similar to our current study in the winter months. Though wildfire smoke is not currently the dominant biomass source in NYS, the proportion of BB in NYS from wildfire smoke may increase in the future due to an expected increase in the frequency of dynamic weather patterns similar to the lingering low pressure system which led to significant biomass exposure in NYS from Canadian wildfires during the summer of 2023 [38]. Similar to the increased risk of hospitalization from asthma related to wildfire smoke, we may expect to see an increased risk of influenza associated with PM2.5 since the proportion of BB in NYS that comes from wildfire smoke increases [37].Though the continued penetrance of Tier 3 vehicles into the New York State vehicle fleet is expected to result in a decrease in SOC [8], it is possible that the increase in organic carbon from wildfire activity over time will contribute more SOC to PM2.5 [39], thereby stabilizing SOC concentrations. The increase in rates of influenza healthcare encounters associated with increased SOC concentrations in 2017–2019 compared to 2014–2016 may indicate an increase in toxicity per unit mass of SOC. This pattern is the same as the main contributors to SOC, gasoline vehicle emissions (GAS) at lag days 0–6, and biomass burning. While we also observed an increased rate of influenza hospitalizations and emergency department visits with secondary sulfate (SS) (except for the 0–6 time period for hospitalization), due to the role of SS as a vector for a heterogeneous collection of condensates, the health effect of specific secondary sulfates remains uncertain [40]. Since the majority of PM2.5 is from inorganic and organic secondary aerosols (i.e. SIA and SOA), the reactivity of each constituent PM2.5 source such as traffic related air pollution (DIE and GAS) and biomass burning have been found to be more similar to the higher oxidative potential of SOC than the less reactive POC [12, 41]. For a viral infection like influenza, PM2.5 constituents with high oxidate potential (e.g. DIE, GAS and BB) have the potential to enhance viral entry into cells, impair pathogen recognition, immune signaling, and immune cell function [14].We will need to continue to focus future studies on the potential pathophysiologic mechanisms of the association between PM2.5 and influenza healthcare encounters and what collection of sources appear to be the main drivers of this association.Inequity in both exposure to PM2.5 and treatment for influenza exist in the U.S. Our study observed that a higher proportion of Black and Hispanic patients with influenza were treated and released from the ED (48% and 27% respectively) compared to those who were admitted (30% and 19% respectively). Our patient proportions are not consistent with national data observing the odds of hospitalization (including intensive care) and death for influenza are higher in Black, Hispanic, and Asian patients when compared to white patients [42]. It is also well known that Black and Hispanic communities suffer a disproportionate burden of traffic related air pollution [43]. These two facts combine to increase the risk of a poor outcome from influenza infection in Black and Hispanic communities when compared to White communities. In a future analysis, we will need to consider how the difference in our local healthcare practice patterns and geographic distribution of source-specific PM2.5 may affect the association between PM/influenza in different racial and ethnic communities.Although there were several strengths of this study, including a large sample size and inclusion of the 4 largest cities in New York State, there are several limitations that should be considered when making inference. First, there is likely exposure misclassification and downward bias resulting from assignment of the same air pollutant concentrations for everyone within 15 miles of an individual monitor (e.g., Buffalo), no matter how far they live from the monitoring station. Second, this study was a wintertime study given the seasonality of influenza infection, limiting the generalizability to year-round respiratory infections or bacterial respiratory infections. Last, to be consistent with our previous analyses, we used a case-crossover design and conditional logistic regression analyses to estimate the rate of influenza hospitalizations and emergency department visits associated with source-specific PM2.5, SOC, and POC concentrations in the previous 7 days. However, as described in our previous analysis of influenza/PM2.5 associations in these same cities, we cannot assess lag periods longer than 7 days without overlap of case and control period dates and thus case and control period pollutant concentrations [22]. Thus, we are limited to assessment of pollutant concentrations in just the previous 1–7 days. Last, the study population is only adult residents, and not children, and only those adults living in urban centers of the state (i.e., within 15 miles). Thus, generalizability of results to children or to adult residents in rural locations is less certain.ConclusionWhile there did not appear to be any clear reduction in influenza healthcare encounters from gasoline emissions during the early implementation period of the Tier 3 emissions standards, we did see a reduction in the rate of healthcare encounters associated with diesel emissions. It is possible that we are seeing the effect of prior diesel regulations to lower sulfur content and that the ability to fully evaluate the health effects of the gasoline emission regulation may come only later once the Tier 3 vehicle penetration into the entire New York State vehicle fleet increases. The finding of a potential increase in the toxicity per unit mass of biomass burning (including wildfires) is concerning due to the expectation that this component of PM2.5 is expected to continue to increase as a proportion of PM2.5 due to climate change. Furthermore, addressing the burden of both influenza and air pollution on disproportionately affected communities will be an important research focus in the future, especially as climate change serves to worsen air quality and increase the frequency and intensity of natural disasters. Given the complexity of the atmospheric chemistry of a changing PM2.5 composition, future studies will need to evaluate effect modification of the rate of respiratory infection healthcare encounters associated with PM2.5 by heat waves and cold waves or implementation of air quality policies.

Participants’ total vaccine literacy and three sub-dimension vaccine literacy (knowledge literacy, competence literacy, and decision-making literacy) were assessed by a validated vaccine literacy scale. Having received influenza vaccination in the past three years or intending to accept it in next influenza season indicates less influenza vaccine hesitancy.Results: Among 997 participants, a sub-optimal vaccine literacy was observed, with a mean score of 66.83 ± 10.27. Regression models 1–4 revealed that participants with middle (aOR: 1.431, P=0.039, 95% CI: 1.018~2.010) or high (aOR: 1.651, P=0.006, 95% CI: 1.157~2.354) total vaccine literacy, as well as those with high competence literacy (aOR: 1.533, P=0.017, 95% CI: 1.079~2.180), or high decision-making literacy (aOR: 1.822, P=0.001, 95% CI: 1.261~2.632) were more likely to have been vaccinated against influenza at least once in past three years. However, those with a high knowledge literacy were associated with a lower influenza vaccine rate (aOR: 0.676, P=0.046, 95% CI: 0.460~0.994). Regression models 5–8 revealed that participants with middle (aOR: 1.661, P=0.008, 95% CI: 1.142~2.414) or high total vaccine literacy (aOR: 2.645, P=0.000, 95% CI: 1.774~3.942), as well as those with middle (aOR: 1.703, P=0.005, 95% CI: 1.177~2.464) or high competence literacy (aOR: 2.346, P=0.000, 95% CI: 1.159~3.461), or high decision-making literacy (aOR: 2.294, P=0.000, 95% CI: 1.531~3.436) were more likely to express the willingness to receive the influenza vaccine in the next influenza season.Conclusion: The participants’ influenza vaccine hesitancy was negatively associated with their total vaccine literacy levels and two of the three sub-dimensions: competence literacy and decision-making literacy. Knowledge literacy suggested a positive or no relationship with influenza vaccine hesitancy.1 IntroductionPlaying a crucial role in protecting public health and preventing the spread of infectious diseases, vaccination stands out as a key primary prevention measure (1). However, vaccine hesitancy is giving rise to refusal or delayed vaccination in the presence of vaccine availability. Even those who have been vaccinated as required may still harbor doubts, leading to fluctuations in vaccination coverage (2). This hesitation could potentially impact the implementation of preventive vaccination, and it has been listed as one of the top ten global health threats by the World Health Organization (WHO) (3). The definition of vaccine literacy drew inspiration from the term “health literacy”. Ratzan SC (4), in 2011, initially proposed the notion of vaccine literacy, which emphasized individuals’ capacity to acquire, comprehend, and utilize fundamental vaccination information and services, while also evaluating the potential consequences and risks of their actions to make informed health choices. Vaccine literacy, managing to transfer effective information and facilitate necessary dialog, has been seen as a promising strategy in tackling vaccine hesitancy (5–7).However, vaccine hesitancy determinants often overlook the significance of inadequate vaccine literacy. This constraint further undermines the effectiveness of vaccination communication efforts (2, 8). Although vaccine literacy is not the only influencing factor in vaccination acceptance, enhancing people’s vaccine literacy and diminishing their vaccine hesitancy remains crucial in promoting vaccination.Influenza is an acute respiratory infectious infection caused by seasonal influenza virus (9). Influenza caused a large number of cases and deaths worldwide through its seasonal wave of infection (10). The Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) reported that even in mild years, influenza can result in 290,000 to 650,000 fatalities, 3 million to 5 million severe cases worldwide, and create more social and economic damage when it is an epidemic (11, 12). The influenza vaccine is a key tool in combating seasonal influenza and its related risks (9). When the circulating virus aligned well with the vaccine, influenza vaccinations were believed to lower the risk of contracting the illness by 40% to 60% (13). However, influenza vaccine hesitancy posed a significant obstacle to worldwide endeavors aimed at alleviating the impact of both seasonal and pandemic influenza (14). The global influenza vaccination rate among the general public was low, with many countries, including the USA, Canada, Europe, and Australia, reporting that influenza vaccine coverage in target populations below the 75% recommended by the World Health Organization (15–19). Additionally, influenza vaccination rates were much lower in middle-low income countriesegions compared to high-income countriesegions (20). Influenza vaccination rates among Chinese residents were notably low. It was found that influenza vaccination rates for general population, individuals with chronic diseases, healthcare workers were 16.74%, 14.12%, and 23.07%, respectively (20). Currently, the influenza vaccine has not been incorporated into China’s National Expanded Programme on Immunization (NEPI), rendering it a self-funded and optional vaccination in the country. According to the Technical Guidelines for Influenza Vaccination in China (2022~2023), it was recommended that individuals aged 6 months and older, willing to receive influenza vaccine and without contraindications, should be vaccinated against influenza (21). However, the implementation of these recommendations faced significant challenges due to influenza vaccine hesitancy (22–24). Certain major cities, such as Beijing and Shenzhen, have enacted policies offering free influenza vaccines to specific high-risk groups, including senior citizens, healthcare workers, and children. However, influenza vaccination rates in these places were still low. For example, influenza vaccination rates among frail old people in Beijing urban communities were just about 20%, and only 4.8% of 5045 elderly with chronic diseases in Shenzhen were immunized against influenza (25, 26). It may suggest that attention should be paid not only to improving affordability but also to enhancing people’s vaccine literacy to alleviate vaccine hesitancy.The effect of vaccine literacy on public vaccine confidence in China has aroused researchers’ attention (27, 28). The relationship between vaccine literacy and vaccination behavior was systematically reviewed, indicating the significance of exploring a more appropriate research tool for evaluating vaccine literacy (5). Most of the research tools served to measure vaccine literacy were intended for general health literacy, rather than being developed specifically for assessing vaccine literacy. The frequently used vaccine literacy scale, Literacy about Vaccination of Adults in Italian (HLVa-IT), which involves 14 items in total and encompasses both functional and interactive-critical dimensions, was developed from the Ishikawa, originally applied to measure health literacy among patients with chronic diseases (29, 30). Vaccine Health Literacy Scale and COVID-19-VLS, containing similar constructs, could be seen as some adaptations of Ishikawa (31, 32). Yang (33) applied the China-HLVa-IT questionnaire to explore its association with vaccine hesitancy in China. It was also an adaptation of HLVa-IT, sharing similar psychometric constructs, including functional, interactive/communicative, and critical items, with a focus on information capacity (33).The ability to process information is a crucial factor influencing individual’s vaccination decision. However, a number of potential determinants were identified as being associated with vaccine coverage, including factors based on rational information processing such as carefully calculating or comparing the risks or benefits of vaccines, as well as factors related to simple heuristics that allow people to make decisions quickly and intuitively (34, 35). That could be one of the main reasons why no conclusive evidence demonstrating a consistent association between health literacy or vaccine literacy and vaccine acceptance. The association has been shown to be positive, while according to others, it is negative or non-existent (31, 36–42). It may suggest that more specific assessment methods should be focused to better understand the causal relationship between vaccine literacy and vaccine hesitancy (5, 43). Hou (44) and Meng (45) built indicator systems for evaluating vaccine confidence and vaccine literacy in China, including dimensions such as basic knowledge, fundamental beliefs, and behavioral capabilities, providing valuable inspiration and a foundation for understanding Chinese public’s vaccine literacy, even though the items were general and abstract. Wang (46) constructed a vaccine literacy scale tailored for community residents in China (China-VLS), not only including the core components of existing tools such as the ability to acquire, understand, and apply information, but also integrating other crucial determinants such as vaccine health beliefs, and vaccination related decision-making literacy. The focus of this tool is on factors influencing vaccine hesitancy from the perspective of individual behavior decision-making, allowing for a deeper observation of the relationship between vaccine literacy and vaccine hesitancy. The aim of the current study was to assess vaccine literacy among Chinese community residents using China-VLS, and to explore the relationship between participants’ vaccine literacy and their influenza vaccine hesitancy.2 Materials and methods2.1 Study design and participantsA self-developed survey questionnaire was utilized on the Credamo JianShu platform to conduct a survey. Credamo is a professional data collection company with 3,000,000 members spanning every province and administrative region in Mainland China. Its panel members were sourced from diverse channels, encompassing offline customers and residents, college campuses (including students and faculty), businesses (including employers and users), as well as previous participants of its offline surveys (47). Credamo distributed survey links to 1000 randomly selected panel members aged over 18 years old for each month from July to September, 2023. Data collection stopped after reaching a predetermined about 1000 participants who completed the survey. A total of 997 observations were retained after manually removing 3 participants who failed 1 attention-checking questions created by the researchers. Effective questionnaire recovery rate was 97%.2.2 Study toolThe questionnaire encompassed demographic information (address, age, education level, marital status, occupation, family income, chronic illness status), questions related to influenza vaccine hesitancy, as well as a validated vaccine literacy scale for Chinese community residents, China-VLS. The construction of China-VLS was discussed in another paper published by the same research team (46). The validated vaccine literacy scale applied in the present study paid more attentions to the key factors influencing vaccine hesitancy, including but not limited to the indicators in other vaccine literacy evaluation tool. Information abilities were the main focus in most research tools used to evaluate vaccine literacy in other studies. The philosophy behind this is the rational decision-making model. However, a number of potential determinants were identified as being associated with vaccine acceptance, including factors based on rational information processing such as carefully calculating or comparing the risks or benefits of vaccines, as well as factors related to simple heuristics that allow people to make decisions quickly and intuitively (34, 35). Sometimes, the latter may play a major role in deciding whether to vaccinate oneself or a child (35). That could be one of main reasons why no conclusive evidence demonstrating a consistent association between health literacy or vaccine literacy skills and vaccine acceptance.The process of identifying the indicators for the vaccine literacy scale was guided, but not limited to, three main kinds of theoretical frameworks (1): Health Behavior Theories such as Knowlege-Attitude-Practice Theory (KAP) and The Health Belief Model (HBM), which have been utilized in past vaccination behavior research (48). KAP focuses on the impact of objective knowledge on health practices through attitude change, while HBM focuses on the impact of subjective health beliefs on health behaviors. They have often been employed to uncover misconceptions or misunderstandings that could impede the implementation of desired activities and serve as potential barriers to health behavior change (49, 50). (2): “3C” Model, proposed by the SAGE of the WHO to analyze the influencing factors of vaccine hesitancy. “3C” refers to three dimensions: Confidence, Convenience and Complacency (51). (3): The existing framework of vaccine literacy scales used in other studies. Most of the research tools served to measure vaccine literacy were intended for general health literacy, rather than being developed specifically for assessing vaccine literacy. And also they were always designed with the perspective of the competence to find, understand and judge information related to vaccine and vaccination.A total of 30 items were developed through a two-round Delphi expert panel consensus. The three first-level indicators were “knowledge literacy”, “competence literacy”, and “decision-making literacy”. “Knowledge literacy” corresponded to the knowledge dimension in the KAP model, covering items related to general and objective knowledge about vaccines and vaccinations, including vaccine features, vaccination procedures, and policy regulations based on the Vaccine Management Law in China. “Competence literacy” centered around information literacy, which served as the core of most existing vaccine literacy scales. It aimed to assess participants’ information processing ability around vaccines and vaccination. Additionally, action capability and payment capability were also involved in “Competence literacy”. “Decision-making literacy” mainly involved health beliefs about vaccines in general, and partly referencing the “3C” model. Four second-level of indicators, disease prevention self-satisfaction, trust, compliance, and collective responsibility were involved in “Decision-making literacy”.The Cronbach’s alpha for this scale was 0.658, which was greater than 0.6, indicating good internal consistency. The Bartlett’s test of sphericity yielded a value of 502.796 (P < 0.001), and the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) test value was 0.764, also greater than 0.6. Three common factors were extracted (eigenvalues all > 1), with a cumulative variance contribution rate of 73.568%.For each item, a score of one point was initially awarded if the participant’s response aligned with the predetermined correct or reasonable options; otherwise, no points were awarded. Subsequently, conversion was performed using the difficulty coefficient method. The difficulty coefficient was calculated as the reciprocal of the correct response rate for each item, with a lower correct response rate corresponding to a higher difficulty coefficient and, consequently, a higher score for correctly answering that item. Finally, the total scale score for each participant was transformed into a 100-point system. The scores of the three sub-dimension vaccine literacy scales were calculated as well (46).Based on the participants’ scale scores from high to low, we divided the total vaccine literacy scores and the scores of each sub-dimension of the vaccine literacy into three levels: low, medium, and high, with roughly equal numbers of people in each group. This categorization facilitated group comparisons and logistic regression analysis.There were two questions about influenza vaccine hesitancy: one was about past influenza vaccination behavior (Have you ever been vaccinated against influenza in the past three years)?, and the other was future influenza vaccination willingness (Will you receive influenza vaccine in the next influenza season)?. Having received influenza vaccination in the past three years or intending to accept it in next influenza season indicated less influenza vaccine hesitancy.2.3 Statistical analysisStata SE17 was used for statistical analysis. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze participants’ general characteristics and their vaccine literacy level.Bivariate analysis included one independent variable and one dependent variable for each group comparison. Categorical variables were presented as counts and percentages (%), and group comparisons were conducted using the chi-square test. Participants’ influenza vaccination rate and the percentage of participants willing to receive the influenza vaccine were the dependent variables, respectively. The total vaccine literacy level, each sub-dimension vaccine literacy level, each socio-demographic variable, and each perception regarding influenza and the influenza vaccine were regarded as independent variables. Each independent variable was analyzed separately with participants’ influenza vaccination rate (see Table 1). Similarly, each independent variable was analyzed separately with the percentage of participants willing to receive the influenza vaccine (see Table 2).Table 1 Table 1 Univariate analysis of participants’ influenza vaccination behavior over the past three years and their vaccine literacy levels, socio-demographic variables, as well as perceptions regarding influenza and influenza vaccine.Table 2 Table 2 Univariate analysis of influenza vaccination willingness in the next influenza season and their vaccine literacy levels, socio-demographic variables, as well as perceptions regarding influenza and influenza vaccine.Multivariate analysis included a single dependent variable along with multiple independent variables, covariates, or controlling variables. We applied four multivariate logistic regression models (Models 1–4) to explore the association between influenza vaccination rate and the total vaccine literacy level, as well as each sub-dimension vaccine literacy level, respectively. The analyses were adjusted for socio-demographic variables, as well as perceptions regarding influenza and the influenza vaccine. Only statistically significant variables were presented in Table 3. Specifically, Model 1 assessed the association between influenza vaccination rate and the total vaccine literacy levels. Models 2–4 assessed the association between influenza vaccination rate and each sub-dimension vaccine literacy levels, respectively.Table 3 Table 3 Multivariate logistic regression analyses of participants’ influenza vaccination behavior over the past three years and their vaccine literacy levels, socio-demographic variables, as well as perceptions regarding influenza and influenza vaccine (N = 997).Similarly, we applied another four multivariate logistic regression models (Models 5–8) to explore the association between the percentage of participants willing to receive influenza vaccine and the total vaccine literacy level, as well as each sub-dimension vaccine literacy level, respectively. The analyses were adjusted for socio-demographic variables, as well as perceptions regarding influenza and the influenza vaccine. Only statistically significant variables were presented in Table 4. Specifically, Model 5 assessed the association between the percentage of participants willing to receive the influenza vaccine in next influenza season and the total vaccine literacy levels. Models 6–8 assessed the association between the percentage of participants willing to receive the influenza vaccine in next influenza season and each sub-dimension vaccine literacy level, respectively.Table 4 Table 4 Multivariate logistic regression analyses of influenza vaccination willingness in the next influenza season and their vaccine literacy levels, socio-demographic variables, as well as perceptions regarding influenza and influenza vaccine (N = 997).Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using logistic regression analysis for categorical variables. For all analyses, a significance threshold of p-value < 0.05, indicating a two-tailed test, was employed.3 Results3.1 General information about participantsAmong the 997 participants, the majority resided in urban areas (800 cases, 80.24%). The participants were predominantly female (758 cases, 76.03%). Since the age group of 18–39 years was the most represented, consisting of 960 individuals (96.29% of the sample), it may be inappropriate to categorize multiple age groups, as seen in other studies. The age of 24 was regarded as an age boundary between youth and adulthood by United Nations (52). The study divided participants into two age groups: those aged 24 years or younger and those older than 24 years. A significant portion had attained a bachelor’s degree or higher (893 cases, 89.57%)1, were unmarried (841 cases, 84.35%), and belonged to three types of occupations: including personnel from government or public institutions (155 cases, 15.55%), employees of corporate companies or others (293 cases, 29.39%), and students (549 cases, 55.07%). The majority of participants fell within the household income range of 5000–10000 (436 cases, 43.73%) or 10001–20000 (264 cases, 26.48%). We categorized the participants’ geographical locations into three groups: East (538 cases, 53.96%), Middle (201 cases, 20.16%), and West (258 cases, 25.88%), based on the locations of their provinces in China. These geographical differences could indicate distinct climates that were consistently associated with the influenza epidemic (53). 611 out of 977 participants (61.28%) have received at least one shot of influenza vaccine over the past three years, and 508 (50.95%) participants express the willingness to receive influenza vaccine in the next influenza season (Table 5).Table 5 Table 5 General information about participants.3.2 Participants’ vaccine literacyThe mean vaccine literacy score of the 997 participants was 66.83 ± 10.27. The mean scores of the three sub-dimension vaccine literacy scales – knowledge literacy scale included 15 items, competence literacy scale included 8 items, and decision-making literacy scale included 7 items – were 33.42 ± 5.17(score range: 20.74~43.18), 17.82 ± 4.61(score range: 2.53~24.70), and 15.48 ± 6.68(score range: 0.00~31.99), respectively.3.3 Bivariate analysis3.3.1 The correlation between influenza vaccination and vaccine literacy levels, socio-demographic variables, and perceptions regarding influenza and the influenza vaccineUnivariate analysis showed a significant correlation between the respondents’ acceptance of the influenza vaccine over the past three years and the total vaccine literacy levels, as well as the three sub-dimensional vaccine literacy levels (P<0.05). A higher influenza vaccination rate was significantly associated with high or middle total vaccine literacy (x2 = 8.706, P<0.05) and high or middle levels of two of the three sub-dimensional vaccine literacy: competence literacy (x2 = 15.452, P<0.001) and decision-making literacy (x2 = 13.107, P<0.05). However, a lower influenza vaccination rate was significantly associated with high knowledge literacy (x2 = 8.334, P<0.05) (see Table 1).There was a significant relationship between influenza vaccination rate and certain socio-demographic variables, such as gender (x2 = 9.778, P<0.05), education level (x2 = 6.806, P<0.05), residing area (x2 = 17.122, P<0.001), and family monthly income (x2 = 10.596, P<0.05) (see Table 1).A significant relationship was also found between the influenza vaccination rate and some of the participants’ perceptions regarding influenza and the influenza vaccine, such as their level of concern about contracting the flu (x2 = 23.976, P<0.001), the perceived severity of being infected with influenza (x2 = 8.238, P<0.05), and the perceived effectiveness of the influenza vaccine (x2 = 31.625, P<0.05) (see Table 1).3.3.2 The correlation between the willingness to receive the influenza vaccine, vaccine literacy levels, socio-demographic variables, and perceptions regarding influenza and the influenza vaccineUnivariate analysis also indicated a significant correlation between the participants’ willingness to receive the influenza vaccine in the next influenza season and the total vaccine literacy levels, as well as three sub-dimensional vaccine literacy levels (P<0.05). A higher willingness to receive the influenza vaccine was significantly associated with high or middle total vaccine literacy (x2 = 37.013, P<0.001) and high or middle levels of two of the three sub-dimensional vaccine literacies: competence literacy (x2 = 48.965, P<0.001) and decision-making literacy (x2 = 50.836, P<0.001). However, a lower willingness to receive the influenza vaccine was significantly associated with high knowledge literacy (x2 = 6.792, P<0.05) (see Table 2).There was a significant relationship between the participants’ willingness to receive the influenza vaccine and certain socio-demographic variables, such as gender (x2 = 5.013, P<0.05), education level (x2 = 9.677, P<0.05), marital status (x2 = 5.553, P<0.05), residing area (x2 = 14.172, P<0.001). (see Table 2)A significant relationship was also found between the participants’ willingness to receive the influenza vaccine and their perceptions regarding influenza and influenza vaccine, such as their level of concern about contracting the flu (x2 = 35.558, P<0.001), and the perceived effectiveness of the influenza vaccine (x2 = 96.575, P<0.001) (see Table 2).3.4 Multivariate analysis3.4.1 The multivariate logistic regression analyses of the relationship between influenza vaccination and vaccine literacy levels, socio-demographic variables, and perceptions regarding influenza and the influenza vaccineThe multivariate logistic regression models 1–4 assessed the association between influenza vaccination behavior over the past three years and both the total vaccine literacy levels and the three sub-dimension vaccine literacy levels, respectively. All these analyses adjusted for socio-demographic variables, as well as perceptions regarding influenza and the influenza vaccine. Only statistically significant variables were presented in Table 3.Participants with middle (aOR: 1.431, P=0.039, 95% CI: 1.018~2.010) or high (aOR: 1.651, P=0.006, 95% CI: 1.157~2.354) total vaccine literacy, or those with high competence literacy (aOR: 1.533, P=0.017, 95% CI: 1.079~2.180), or high decision-making literacy (aOR: 1.822, P=0.001, 95% CI: 1.261~2.632) were more likely to be vaccinated against influenza at least once in the past three years. However, participants with a high knowledge literacy were associated with a lower influenza vaccination rate (aOR: 0.676, P=0.046, 95% CI: 0.460~0.994) (see Table 3).In addition, the multivariate logistic regressions showed a significant relationship between past influenza vaccination behavior and certain variables about socio-demographic variables. For example, Model 1 indicated that males (aOR: 1.606, P=0.006, 95% CI: 1.143~2.256), participants aged 25 and above(aOR: 1.692, P=0.011, 95% CI: 1.128~2.539), those with an education level below a bachelor’s degree (aOR: 1.970, P=0.008, 95% CI: 1.190~3.259), residents of the Middle (aOR: 2.181, P=0.000, 95% CI: 1.496~3.179), or West areas (aOR: 1.667, P=0.003, 95% CI: 1.192~2.332), corporate employees or others (aOR: 1.636, P=0.016, 95% CI: 1.096~2.442), staff of government and public institutions (aOR: 1.779, P=0.017, 95% CI: 1.107~2.860), and those with a family monthly income of 5000–10000 (aOR: 1.815, P=0.002, 95% CI: 1.237~2.662) or above 20000 (aOR: 2.094, P=0.007, 95% CI: 1.220~3.596) had higher times greater likelihood of receiving the influenza vaccine compared to females, participants aged 18–24, those with a bachelor’s degree or above, residents of the East area, students, and those with a family monthly income of less than 5000, respectively. Models 2–4 showed similar results (see Table 3).It was also found in the multivariate logistic regressions a significant relationship between past influenza vaccination behavior and perceptions regarding influenza and the influenza vaccine. Model 1 indicated that participants who partially concerned (aOR: 1.954, P=0.001, 95% CI: 1.294~2.951) or concerned (aOR: 2.523, P=0.000, 95% CI: 1.608~3.958) about getting influenza, and those who partially agreed (aOR: 1.687, P=0.004, 95% CI: 1.177~2.420) or agreed (aOR: 3.016, P=0.000, 95% CI: 1.921~4.735) with the effectiveness of the influenza vaccine were more likely to be vaccinated against influenza in the past three years, compared to those who had no concern about getting influenza, and those who disagreed with the effectiveness of the influenza vaccine. Models 2–4 showed similar results (see Table 3).3.4.2 The multivariate logistic regression analyses of the relationship between the willingness to receive the influenza vaccine, vaccine literacy levels, socio-demographic variables, and perceptions regarding influenza and the influenza vaccineThe multivariate logistic regression models 5–8 assessed the association between the willingness to receive the influenza vaccine in the next influenza season and both the total vaccine literacy levels and the three sub-dimension vaccine literacy levels, respectively. All these analyses adjusted for socio-demographic variables, as well as perceptions regarding influenza and the influenza vaccine. Only statistically significant variables were presented in Table 4.Participants who had middle (aOR: 1.661, P=0.008, 95% CI: 1.142~2.414) or high total vaccine literacy (aOR: 2.645, P=0.000, 95% CI: 1.774~3.942), or middle (aOR: 1.703, P=0.005, 95% CI: 1.177~2.464) or high competence literacy (aOR: 2.346, P=0.000, 95% CI: 1.159~3.461), or high decision-making literacy (aOR: 2.294, P=0.000, 95% CI: 1.531~3.436) were more likely to show willingness to receive influenza vaccine in the next influenza season (see Table 4).There were no significant associations between participants’ willingness to receive the influenza vaccine and most of their socio-demographic variables. However, there was a significant association between influenza vaccination willingness and those who resided in the Middle area (aOR: 1.650, P=0.015, 95% CI: 1.104~2.467, in Model 5), compared to those who resided in the East area. Models 6–8 showed similar results (see Table 4).In addition, the multivariate logistic regressions revealed a significant relationship between the willingness to receive the influenza vaccine in the next influenza season and perceptions regarding influenza and the influenza vaccine, along with their vaccination history within the previous three years. Model 5 indicated that participants who partially concerned (aOR: 2.206, P=0.001, 95% CI: 1.354~3.594) or concerned (aOR: 3.759, P=0.000, 95% CI: 2.222~6.358) about getting influenza, those who partially worried about side effects of influenza vaccine (aOR: 1.434, P=0.040, 95% CI: 1.016~1.025), and those who partially agreed (aOR: 2.764, P=0.000, 95% CI: 1.794~4.256) or agreed (aOR: 7.068, P=0.000, 95% CI: 4.199~11.896) with the effectiveness of the influenza vaccine, and those who had received influenza vaccine in the past three years (aOR: 6.062, P=0.000, 95% CI: 4.386~8.379) had higher willingness of receiving influenza vaccine in the next influenza season, compared to those who had no concern about getting influenza, who worried about the side effects of influenza vaccine, who disagreed with the effectiveness of the influenza vaccine, and who had not received influenza vaccine, respectively. Models 6–8 showed similar results (see Table 4).4 DiscussionThe study indicated that about 60% of the participants had a history of influenza vaccination in the past three years. In recent years, studies showed that the Chinese public’s influenza vaccination rate in a single year was about 20% (54–57). And the influenza vaccination rates in some high-risk population group including health-care workers, children, and senior citizens were about 50% (58–60). Therefore, it was argued that the influenza vaccination rate demonstrated in the study was roughly consistent with that found in other studies. And the influenza vaccination rate was higher than those observed before the COVID-19 pandemic. About a 2% influenza vaccination rate among the Chinese public was reported in 2018 (61, 62). Numerous studies indicated that Chinese residents had a clear shift in attitudes toward influenza vaccination, with more enthusiasm for influenza vaccination, under the background of the COVID-19 epidemic, and COVID-19 vaccination history was associated with the positive actions of influenza vaccination during the pandemic (55, 63). However, the study found that only about 50% of participants expressed willingness to be vaccinated against influenza in the next influenza season. It is essential to pay significant attention to whether the influenza vaccine rate and public enthusiasm, heightened by COVID-19, would decrease as the threat of COVID-19 diminishes and people’s apprehensions subside.Using a validated vaccine literacy scale, the present study showed a sub-optimal vaccine literacy among participants, with a mean score of 66.83 ± 10.27 (full score was set as 100). A modified HLVa-IT scale was used to assess Chinese residents’ vaccine literacy and demonstrated that the mean vaccine literacy value was 52.16 ± 8.93 (full score was set as 75) among 7731 participants (33). However, the construction and content of these two types of scales differed, although they shared some similar indicators or descriptions. The HLVa-IT scale was developed in the Italian context and has been expanded to other countries, primarily focusing on evaluating participants’ ability to handle vaccine-related information across three dimensions: functional, interactive, and critical vaccine literacy (29). The vaccine literacy scale used in the study was more comprehensive and tailored for Chinese community residents, not only including indicators regarding information ability but also other indicators related to vaccine knowledge literacy and decision-making literacy. And it might be the first to list decision-making literacy as an independent dimension on the vaccine literacy scale and find its positive association with influenza vaccination. Vaccine hesitancy referred to an uncertainty condition about a vaccination decision (64). Vaccine hesitancy was marked by fluctuations in mental states, particularly in emotional responses. In the context of decision-making, it’s essential to distinguish between the affective nature of vaccine hesitancy and its behavioral manifestations (33). Vaccination behavior factors, including information ability, vaccination practical ability, and payment ability, were grouped under the dimension of competence literacy in China-VLS; And subjective and affective factors, such as disease prevention self-satisfaction, trust, compliance, and collective responsibility, were categorized under the dimension of decision-making literacy (46).The present study revealed that participants’ acceptance of the influenza vaccine in past and future intention to be vaccinated was positively associated with their total vaccine literacy levels and two of the three sub-dimensions: competence literacy and decision-making literacy. However, knowledge literacy suggested a negative or no relationship with acceptance or intention about influenza vaccination. Previous studies focused on the relationship between health literacy, vaccine literacy or educational level and vaccine acceptance, and it was indicated that the link between them and vaccination acceptance was uncertain (5, 65, 66). However, there have been few studies focusing specifically on the relationship between vaccine knowledge and vaccine uptake. It was found that health knowledge level might not be related with health outcomes. And knowledge about vaccinations did not enhance people’s engagement in deciding whether to vaccinate themselves or their children (31, 67). This is also where the limitations of applying the KAP (knowledge, attitude, and practice) theory to address public health issue (68, 69). People with a lower knowledge level were more willing to receive the vaccine because they might have higher conformity to medical advice and be more influenced by others in their decision-making process (70). And people with a higher knowledge level could help develop their perceptions regarding disease susceptibility, vaccine effectiveness and vaccination risk (55). However, using the knowledge for high involving and calculating of the pros and cons regarding vaccination can also cause an abundance of contradictory information and fence-sitting which describes a state of indecision or reluctance to make a decision, resulting in no clear preference for or against vaccination (71, 72).It may be suggested that participants’ ability to utilize information and vaccine services, as assessed by competence literacy, along with their subjective and affective performance, as assessed by decision-making literacy, had a more positive influence on influenza vaccine acceptance than knowledge literacy. Additionally, higher levels of competence literacy and decision-making literacy could mitigate the negative influence of knowledge literacy on vaccine hesitancy. Previous studies also indicated that the public’s vaccination intention was more closely associated with their subjective norms and many social determinants (31, 67, 73). The vaccine literacy concept mirrored the idea of health literacy. It’s not just about possessing knowledge regarding vaccines, but also about establishing a simplified system for communicating and providing vaccines as an essential component of an effective healthcare system (4). Recognizing that merely acquiring knowledge does not necessarily promote vaccination, the current approach to promoting vaccination behavior and addressing vaccine hesitancy is shifting from a focus on knowledge and attitudes to the application of behavioral science (74, 75). And improving “competence literacy” and “decision-making literacy” is precisely where behavioral science can play a role. However, the authors argued that enhancing people’s scientific knowledge about vaccines is crucial. Limited knowledge about vaccines might contribute to the spread of health misinformation and was associated with lower vaccination rates (76).As a validated vaccine literacy scale, the reliability of predicting the relationship between vaccine literacy and influenza vaccine hesitancy requires further research and verification. Lorini’s (65) systematic review identified all possible relationships, including positive association, negative association, or no association, between health literacy and vaccination, from nine reviewed papers. Hence, future multi-center, large-sample, and longitudinal studies should be conducted to enhance our understanding of the role of vaccine literacy in predicting influenza vaccine acceptance and hesitancy.A systematic review examining barriers to intention and behavior in influenza vaccination revealed that socio-demographic variables, including gender and age among others, were frequently identified as the primary predictors. However, they were also the most inconsistent in predicting influenza vaccination (14). It was found in current study that certain socio-demographic variables, including gender, age, education, work, and family income, had significant correlations with participants’ influenza vaccination history. However, these socio-demographic variables showed no significant association with participants’ willingness to be vaccinated against influenza in the future. Additionally, stronger perceptions of influenza susceptibility and influenza vaccine effectiveness were positively correlated with both their influenza vaccination history and influenza vaccination willingness in the future. The findings may suggest that vaccine health education should be enhanced to improve the public’s vaccine health beliefs. In addition, more attention should be paid to females, individuals with a bachelor’s degree or higher, students, and those with low family income, as they were more likely to exhibit influenza vaccine hesitancy in their actual vaccination behavior.This study had several limitations. Firstly, the cross-sectional data made it difficult to identify cause-effect relationships. Secondly, using online sample pool may introduce a selection bias in participating in the study and make it difficult to extend the research conclusions. Most of online surveys were related to low participation of people with lower educational levels and the elderly. The present study sample had the similar issue. Thirdly, the data presented in the present study was self-reported and partly reliant on the participants’ honesty and accurate memory.5 ConclusionThe present study applied a validated vaccine literacy scale to assess participants’ vaccine literacy and analyzed its relationship with influenza vaccine hesitancy. The participants demonstrated sub-optimal vaccine literacy. Influenza vaccine acceptance among them was positively associated with the total vaccine literacy and two of the three vaccine sub-dimension literacy levels: “competence literacy” and “decision-making literacy”, and negatively associated with “knowledge literacy”. It may suggest that improving the public’s competence literacy and decision-making literacy could mitigate the negative impact of vaccine knowledge on vaccine acceptance, especially since some highly educated individuals may hesitate to receive vaccines after weighing the pros and cons using their acquired vaccine knowledge. Given several research limitations, future multi-center, large-sample, and longitudinal studies should be conducted to enhance the understanding of the role of vaccine literacy in predicting influenza vaccine acceptance and hesitancy.Data availability statementThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation.Ethics statementThis study was ethically reviewed and approved by the Biomedical Ethics Committee at Anhui Medical University (IRB number: 20210614).

A possible explanation about this discrepancy is that, in the Chinese cultural context, some participants believe that their educational level is the degree they are studying and preparing to obtain. It is similar that a doctoral candidate in western culture is always unofficially called “doctor” in China. As we do not know the exact percentage of participants who had this kind of misunderstanding, we do not modify the participants education level in the manuscript.References 1.

More than half of Colorado's licensed dairy herds have been hit with outbreaks, many of them in Weld County, where the virus spread to a large commercial poultry farms and infected 10 livestock workers and poultry cullers. So far, Colorado is the only one of 13 affected states to order regular bulk tank testing.Officials haven't said if the cows at the farms identified through bulk tank testing had clinical signs.As of today, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has confirmed 179 H5N1 outbreaks in dairy herds from 13 states. Among the total are 52 from Colorado, which has the most of any state.Governor extends emergency declarationIn a related development, Colorado Governor Jared Polis on August 2 extended an emergency declaration an extra 30 days — through September 1 — to free up resources for the avian flu response in Weld County.Polis first announced the emergency declaration on July 5.

Matt Bargar / Flickr cc The patient sought medical care the week of July 13 and was not hospitalized. No related illnesses have been found among the patient's contacts, and the investigation is ongoing.Exposure in Michigan case still under investigationSeparately, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services today said tests have confirmed H3N2v flu in a resident of Ingham County whose samples tested positive in late July. The results were confirmed by the CDC. The source of the patient's exposure is still under investigation, and so far there is no known exposure to swine or other animals.The two cases raise the number of variant flu cases this year to five. The three others involved variant H1N2 (H1N2v) and occurred in patients in Pennsylvania. Most variant flu cases are linked to contact with pigs, and the United States typically experiences a summer rise that comes with exposure at agricultural fairs. US COVID activity continues to pick up News brief Lisa Schnirring Topics COVID-19 US COVID indicators show no sign of slowing down, with most areas of the country seeing consistent rises, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said today in its latest data updates. NIAID/Flickr cc Emergency department encounters for COVID make up 2.3% of all visits, up 4.1% from the previous week. Levels are highest—in the moderate range—across the South and Southeast. Wastewater levels jump to 'very high' levelWastewater detections continue to rise steadily and are now at the very high level. Levels continue to trend upward in all US regions and are highest in the West, followed by the South and Midwest. Test positivity for COVID is still rising and is at 17.6% nationally, up 1.2% compared to the previous week. Test positivity is highest in the region that includes Texas and surrounding states. Hospitalization rates are still elevated and are highest in people ages 65 and older. Deaths from the virus continue to trend upward, with a 7.1% rise from the previous week. COVID deaths still make up a small proportion of US fatalities, just 1.5%. Childhood vaccines have prevented a half billion illnesses, saved the US $2.7 trillion in 3 decades, study estimates News brief Jim Wappes Topics Childhood Vaccines Phil Roeder / Flickr cc Among US children born in the past 30 years, childhood vaccines have prevented an estimated 508 million cases of illness, 32 million hospitalizations, and 1.1 million deaths, resulting in direct savings of $540 billion and societal savings of $2.7 trillion, according to a study yesterday in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.Researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) analyzed data since 1994, when the US Vaccines for Children (VFC) program was launched to cover the cost of vaccines for children whose families might not be able to afford them. They assessed the impact of routine childhood immunizations among both VFC-eligible and non–VFC-eligible children born from 1994 to 2023 for nine vaccines: diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine; Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate vaccine; poliovirus vaccines; measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine; hepatitis B vaccine; varicella vaccine; pneumococcal conjugate vaccine; hepatitis A vaccine; and rotavirus vaccine."Although influenza and COVID-19 vaccines are recommended for routine immunization," the authors wrote, "they were not included in this analysis, because the methods for assessing their costs and effects differ from those for other vaccines." They also did not include recently approved respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccines.More than 1 million deaths, 32 million hospital cases avertedThe researchers calculated averted illnesses and deaths and associated costs over the lifetimes of 30 annual cohorts of children born during the study period using established economic models. They also estimated net savings for the healthcare system and for society as a whole.Routine childhood immunizations remain a highly cost-effective public health intervention.The investigators found that, among about 117 million children, routine childhood vaccinations prevented approximately 508 million lifetime cases of illness, 32 million hospitalizations, and 1,129,000 deaths, at a net savings of $540 billion in direct costs and $2.7 trillion in societal costs.They conclude, "Routine childhood immunizations remain a highly cost-effective public health intervention ... Based on the 2022 CDC Market Share Report, VFC made a substantial contribution to these reductions by purchasing approximately one half of childhood vaccines at discounted prices." Poll: Americans' knowledge, concern about mpox has dropped News brief Stephanie Soucheray, MA Topics Mpox Marina Demidiuk/ iStock As a large mpox outbreak in Africa has set off alarm bells in the global health community, Americans' knowledge of the virus and risk factors surrounding transmission has dropped compared to just 2 years ago, according to new survey from researchers at the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania.The survey of 1,496 US adults conducted last month shows only 5% of Americans are worried about contracting mpox in the next 3 months, compared to 21% in August 2022, when a global outbreak primarily among men who have sex with men was infecting thousands of Americans and Europeans. Only 9% of those polled last month are worried that they or their family members will contract mpox.The 2022 outbreak was fueled by infections caused by clade 2 of the virus, which is significantly less deadly than the clade 1 strain currently fueling the outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and surrounding countries. Awareness of vaccine also decreased Though no clade 1 cases have been described in the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention earlier this week said US clinicians should be on alert for any symptoms of mpox in patients who had recently been to the DRC or bordering countries. "The speed with which the public learned needed information about mpox in the summer of 2022 was a tribute to effective communication by the public health community," said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, PhD, director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center and director of the survey, in a press release. "That same expertise should now be deployed to ensure that those at risk remember mpox's symptoms, modes of transmission, and the protective power of vaccination."The speed with which the public learned needed information about mpox in the summer of 2022 was a tribute to effective communication by the public health community.Only 45% of those polled said they knew a vaccine for mpox exists, down from 61% in August 2022. Six countries confirm more polio cases as WHO readies Gaza vaccination campaign News brief Lisa Schnirring Topics Polio Six countries reported more polio cases this week, including Afghanistan and Pakistan with more wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases, according to the latest weekly update from the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI). CDC Global / Flickr cc Afghanistan reported 2 new WPV1 cases, 1 in Kandahar and the other in Hilmand, putting its total at 11 for the year. Pakistan reported 3 more cases, 2 in Balochistan and 1 in Punjab, boosting its number to 12 for 2024. Both countries have already doubled the number of cases they reported in 2023.Elsewhere, four African countries reported cases involving circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2). The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) reported 2 cases, both in Maindombe. Ethiopia reported a case in Gambella, boosting its total to 12 for the year. Nigeria also reported 1 more case, in Jigawa, lifting its total to 38. South Sudan reported 1 case in Upper Nile, making 7 infections for 2024. WHO preparing polio vaccine campaign for GazaAt a World Health Organization (WHO) briefing this week, Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, said that, following the detection of polio in wastewater samples from Gaza, the WHO is preparing polio vaccination campaigns and is sending more than 1 million doses to be administer in the weeks ahead.He said the group is mourning the sudden death of Aidan O'Leary, who was director of the WHO's Polio Eradication Program. Tedros said that, before O'Leary died while on vacation with his family, he was working on a plan for two rounds of polio vaccination in Gaza targeting 600,000 children younger than 8 years old."We need absolute freedom of movement for health workers and medical equipment to carry out these complex operations safely and effectively," Tedros said. "A ceasefire, or at least 'days of tranquility' during preparation and delivery of the vaccination campaigns are required to protect children in Gaza from polio." Quick takes: Mpox vaccine contract, Oropouche travel alert, Oregon measles outbreak News brief Lisa Schnirring Topics Mpox Measles Oropouche Virus Bavarian Nordic announced yesterday that it has received a new contract worth $156.8 million from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) to replenish the US supply of bulk product to make the Jynneos vaccine against mpox and smallpox. BARDA is part of the US Department of Health and Human Services. The bulk product will be made in 2024 and will partly be used to restock inventory that was used to make vaccine for the 2022 mpox outbreak. Replenishing bulk inventory is also needed to fulfil the company's existing contract to make next-generation freeze-dried vaccine for smallpox preparedness in the United States. The contract amount also covers storage of the vaccine from 2025 to 2027.In a threat assessment today, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) alerted travelers and clinicians about the risk of Oropouche virus infection in certain parts of the Americas, following 19 imported cases reported in June and July, the first for the European region. The ECDC said the risk is moderate for people traveling to or living in epidemic areas in South America, Central America, and the Caribbean. It noted, however, that the risk is higher for those visiting heavily affected areas, including Brazil's northern states and the Amazon region, and for those who don't take adequate protective measures. The agency said the disease is mainly spread by a midge species not found in Europe, though several types of mosquitoes are potential vectors. The virus typically causes an acute febrile illness, but recent data from the Americas suggest that infections in pregnant women can lead to severe fetal outcomes, including death and microcephaly (small brain and head size).The Oregon Health Authority recently sent an alert to health providers to be on the lookout for measles cases amid ongoing community transmission. In its latest update, the OHA said 26 cases have been confirmed, all involving unvaccinated people. Two patients were hospitalized, and no deaths have been reported. Ten cases are in kids younger than 10 years old, and 11 involve young people ages 10 to 19 years old. Seventeen cases have been reported in Marion County, with eight in Clackamas and one in Multnomah. In the United States this year, measles activity is at its highest level since 2019, which was a record-setting year. So far this year, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported 211 cases.

Search|t Updates Countries Disasters Organizations Topics Jobs Training Informing humanitarians worldwide 24/7 — a service provided by UN OCHA World + 20 more Epidemiological Alert - SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and other respiratory viruses in the Americas Region - 5 August 2024 Format Situation Report Source PAHO Posted 7 Aug 2024 Originally published 5 Aug 2024 Origin View original Attachments Download Report (PDF | 1.28 MB) Given the concurrent or consecutive circulation of different respiratory viruses, such as SARS-CoV2, influenza, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), the Pan American Health Organization / World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) recommends that Member States maintain constant surveillance, contribute to regional genomic surveillance for early detection of the circulation of variants of concern and at the same time maintain updated preparedness and response plans of the health care system at all levels to respond to a possible increase in outpatient cases, hospitalizations and deaths, as well as continue efforts to increase the proportion of vaccinated persons, mainly in vulnerable and high-risk populations. Summary of the situation With the introduction of SARS-CoV-2, patterns of increased acute respiratory viral illness activity have been observed when there is concurrent circulation of different respiratory viruses or activity outside of the typical seasonal periods for these viruses. Concurrent or consecutive circulation of different respiratory viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), can increase pressure on healthcare activity, especially when the circulation of any of these viruses is coupled with the seasonal occurrence of other illnesses. Based on respiratory virus surveillance data reported by countries in the Region of the Americas to the Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO), a progressive increase in SARS-CoV-2 activity has been observed from epidemiological week (EW) 17 to EW 28 of 2024. This increase has been observed particularly in the subregions(1) of the Caribbean since EW 17, North America since EW 18, Andean since EW 20 and Central America since EW 23 (Figure 1) (1). The circulating variants with the highest prevalence in the Americas region, according to data available on the Global Initiative for Shared Respiratory Virus Data (GISAID) platform, are JN.1, with a gradual increase in subvariants KP.2, KP.3, and LB.1 (Figure 2) (2). These subvariants have shown increased immune evasion and infectivity, suggesting a potential increase in transmission and cases of COVID-19 (3). This SARS-CoV-2 circulation coincides with influenza epidemic activity, predominantly of subtype A(H3N2), in the Andean and Central American subregions and some Caribbean countries (Figure 3) (1), and of RSV in the Andean and Central American subregions (Figure 4) (1).

Contamination ControlManagementFood DefenseMicrobiological Avian Influenza, Food Safety Messaging, and Biosurveillance Companies will need to think more strategically about how food safety assurance messaging must be made complimentary to traditional food safety practices By Robert A. Norton Ph.D., Cris A. Young D.V.M., M.P.H., Diplomate A.C.V.P.M., Daniel M. Gerstein Ph.D., Marcus (Marc) Sachs P.E. Image credit: STEPHANE ETIENNE/iStock/Getty Images Plus via Getty Images August 8, 2024 Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI), or "avian flu," is a disease generally transmitted by wild and domestic avian species to other birds but also, on occasion, to other animal species. Caused by the avian influenza viruses A(H5) and A(H7), or "IAV," the disease is frequently fatal in birds, but can also cause mild to serious respiratory diseases in mammals and even sporadically in people. From January 1, 2003 to March 28, 2024, a total of 888 cases of human infection have occurred in 23 countries. Of those, death resulted in 463 cases, giving a cumulative mortality rate (CMR) of 52 percent.1 The bulk of these cases were respiratory-borne and due to "…exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments"1 and, therefore, are not food safety related. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services including the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR), as well as state veterinary and public health authorities are currently investigating outbreaks of A(H5N1) that have occurred among a number of dairy herds in multiple states.2 Subsequent to the findings of HPAI in the affected dairy herds, two, possibly three individuals at press time, who worked with affected herds, were diagnosed with mild cases of Avian Influenza, one just in the form of a mild conjunctivitis. At the time of this article, all had been medically resolved with no serious complications. FDA, in collaboration with USDA, has begun testing commercial pasteurized milk supplies. Preliminary testing did not detect any live virus in the pasteurized milk. More specifically, FDA stated, "…preliminary results of egg inoculation tests on quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)-positive retail milk samples show that pasteurization is effective in inactivating HPAI. This additional testing did not detect any live, infectious virus. These results reaffirm our assessment that the commercial milk supply is safe."3 Raw milk, on the other hand, has been confirmed to contain live HPAI virus, and the risk to humans is specifically unknown. CDC is now posting a dashboard of Influenza A Wastewater Data,4 which represents a useful tool in understanding IAV in the ecosystem and could be an indicator for further specific surveillance. Given the primacy of safety and security of the food supply, new and cost-effective solutions are needed. In the current environment of geopolitical complexity and malevolent activities, companies will increasingly find it necessary to think more strategically about how food safety assurance messaging must be made complimentary to traditional food safety practices. Technological Solutions The authors here advocate the need for new technologies to address current and future food safety needs. In our previously published article, titled, "Bringing New Technologies to Bear for Biosurveillance,"5 we promoted the development of a Biosurveillance Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (BISR) system, which could be used to promote rapid detection and predictive analysis. BISR would consist of a layered and linked array of sensors that could begin on the ground and in aquatic systems and extend into space via satellites and other platforms. These sensor arrays would use hyperspectral imagery to seek out volatile organic compounds, or "volatilomes," which are associated with changes that occur previous to and during disease state development in both animals and plants. The analysis could begin with data collected at the producer level and continue through processing, through to the entire food chain, all the way to the consumer. Enabling the analysis and subsequent decision-making would be made possible through properly trained artificial intelligence (AI)-based modeling. The end result would be a safer and more secure food supply. Evolving Threats Under previously defined priorities, ensuring food safety would have been enough, but no longer. Our nation's adversaries are developing sophisticated cyber weapons and malevolent techniques that could target the proposed BISR system and other food safety systems and databases in an attempt to compromise the data. These same nation-state and criminal organizations and activist adversaries could also directly target food companies, their employees, and even consumers in an attempt to convince them that the food supply is not safe. Coordinated, malevolent efforts could come in multiplicity of sophisticated forms. The 2021 cyber-attack on JBS,6 a major global meat processing company, is a stark reminder of how foreign threat actors can and will target the food sector, potentially undermining consumer confidence in the safety and reliability of the food supply. JBS was hit by a ransomware attack attributed to REvil, a sophisticated criminal group with possible links to Russia. The attack led to the temporary shutdown of JBS operations in the U.S., Canada, and Australia, significantly disrupting the meat supply chain. This incident highlighted vulnerabilities in critical infrastructure and raised concerns about the integrity of food production processes. The fear is that such disruptions could lead consumers to question the safety and security of their food, as the attack demonstrated the potential for cyber criminals to interfere with food supply chains, potentially leading to contamination or scarcity. The attack also underscored the broader implications of cybersecurity weaknesses in essential industries within the food sector and the need for robust measures to protect against such threats, particularly at times when other food safety and health issues are emerging. In another article by the authors entitled, "Malevolent AI: Navigating the Shadows of Technology Advancement in the Food Industry,"7 we discussed how malign actors could use the increasingly powerful tools of AI to target companies. Given the evolving threats, food companies will also need to consider in the present and future how to protect themselves against the newest form of threat from these AI tools—"mind hacking." What this means is that in the rapidly evolving landscape of food safety, traditional defenses focusing on compartmentalized biological, physical, cyber, and information security are no longer sufficient. As digital infrastructures become more complex, the threat landscape expands, encompassing not only technical vulnerabilities but also human cognitive processes. Cognitive security, a relatively new frontier, addresses the manipulation of human perception and decision-making through misinformation, disinformation, and psychological operations. Our nation and its critical infrastructures, including food and agriculture, are in the early stages of a "hybrid world war" that, at a minimum, will include, "…mind war [overwhelming your enemy with argument], psyops [psychological operations], and cognitive warfare."8 The resulting cognitive threats can and will have far-reaching impacts, from undermining trust in institutions to influencing public opinion and behavior on a massive scale. Coordinated efforts are needed to protect not just our systems and data, but also the minds of individuals who interact with these technologies, including the consumer. By combining robust cyber defenses with strategies to counter cognitive threats, organizations can better safeguard against the full spectrum of emerging modern threats. This holistic approach requires collaboration across disciplines, leveraging expertise in psychology, information technology, and security to develop resilient defenses. Future articles will delve deeper into the mechanisms of cognitive security, exploring its implications and strategies for effective protection of the food industry. Coordination of Efforts Between Business and Government Coordination across the biodefense national enterprise must become a top priority. The National Blueprint for Biodefense, published in April 2024 by the Bipartisan Commission on Biodefense, highlights shortfalls and makes recommendations to improve the situational awareness from the federal to the state, local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT) stakeholder community.9 Necessary measures identified in the Blueprint include developing and implementing a national diagnostics plan, having rapid point-of-care diagnostics, and investing in ubiquitous and multiplexed detection capabilities. Improving governance across the U.S. national biodefense enterprise also implies having agreements in place regarding the sharing of information. The National Blueprint for Biodefense recommends having a "public health data infrastructure and collection during biological emergencies."9 This recommendation responds to our demonstrated inability to share data efficiently in real time across the stakeholder community during biological emergencies, as evidenced during the COVID-19 pandemic. It includes interfacing effectively and in a timely manner with international authorities and partners. Government and industry should coordinate closely on all aspects of biosurveillance. Coordination through the critical infrastructure sector coordinating committees supports the development, planning, and implementation of the preparedness, response, and mitigations for a significant biological event.10 Training and exercises should be used to refine readiness, identify weakness, and take corrective measures. This planning should include identifying the triggers that signify the progression of the biological incident and the responses and mitigations that should be made during the incident. Biosurveillance and the sharing of biosurveillance data is inherently a complex issue. The tenth amendment of the U.S. Constitution designates "all government powers not specifically designated to the federal government" to the states and the people.11 Public health is an area not so designated and, therefore, remains the purview of the states. As a result, "State health agencies collect and analyze information; conduct inspections; plan; set policies and standards; carry out national and state mandates; manage and oversee environmental, educational, and personal health services; and assure access to health care for underserved residents; they are involved in resources development; and they respond to health hazards and crises."11It is this fact of history that continues to hinder efforts to establish an overarching U.S. biosurveillance system. This means that the federal government must incentivize states to share their biosurveillance data, rather than direct that this data-sharing occurs. Demonstrating the value add of such data-sharing, including incorporating new technologies or concepts for biosurveillance such as BISR, could make data-sharing and participating in a national biosurveillance program more attractive to the SLTT. The authors have pointed out in several articles that the food industry needs a robust and comprehensive Information Sharing and Analysis Center (ISAC)12–17 that can serve the entire sector beyond just a handful of the largest corporations. Our adversaries will target all levels of the food supply chain, from growers and producers to retailers and consumers. Everything within the food supply is interconnected. Disruption in any portion of the food chain causes cascading effects. Information-sharing about security and safety issues is not a violation of anti-trust laws and should be encouraged across the sector. A stronger partnership of information-sharing is needed among the government, private-sector businesses, and consumers to better understand the current impact of avian influenza, potential other biological threats, and the probable impact of AI on food safety messaging.

Yabes, MD, Brooke Army Medical Center, Fort Sam Houston, TX An estimated 60,000 to 160,000 respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-associated hospitalizations and 6000 to 10,000 deaths occur annually among those age 65 or older in the US, according to data cited by the investigators of a newly published study examining the severity of RSV versus COVID-19 and influenza in hospitalized US adults.1 The Bottom Line"By understanding the potential seriousness of disease caused by RSV, clinicians can better advise their patients at increased risk for severe disease on the importance of vaccination against it." – Diya Surie, MD, Coronavirus and Other Respiratory Viruses Division, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, CDCThe 2023-2024 respiratory viral season was the first in which RSV vaccines were FDA approved and available to recommended populations—including adults 60 years and older—in the US.2 The RSV vaccine approval has been expanded for the 2024-25 respiratory viral season to include adults ages 50 to 59 at increased risk for lower respiratory tract disease.3 The investigators suggested that comparing the severity rates of RSV infection with those of COVID-19 and influenza by vaccination status would provide a rationale for vaccination against RSV.1 For this prospective study, the investigators evaluated disease severity in 7998 adults (median age, 67 years; 50.6% female) in the US hospitalized with acute respiratory illness and laboratory-confirmed RSV, SARS-CoV-2, or influenza infection between February 1, 2022, to May 31, 2023—the 16 months prior to the ACIP recommendations for RSV vaccines—at 1 of 25 hospitals in 20 US states within the Investigating Respiratory Viruses in the Acutely Ill (IVY) Network (funded by the CDC and coordinated by Vanderbilt University Medical Center). Using multivariable logistic regression, the investigators compared the severity of RSV in these patients with the severity of COVID-19 or influenza during the same period and stratified the results based on influenza and COVID-19 vaccination status. Outcomes included invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and in-hospital death.1 The investigators found that 6.1%, 80.3%, and 13.7% were hospitalized with RSV, COVID-19, and influenza, respectively. Peak hospitalization for RSV and influenza occurred between November to December 2022; COVID-19 hospitalization occurred throughout the study period. Those hospitalized with RSV tended to be younger than those hospitalized with COVID-19 (age 65 [median 52-75] vs 68 [56-78]; P=.002). Among hospitalized patients, 12% with RSV, 14.1% of those unvaccinated patients with COVID-19, and 9.2% of those vaccinated patients with COVID-19, experienced IMV or death. For those vaccinated or unvaccinated for influenza, 5.1% and 10.3%, respectively, experienced IMV or death. After adjusting for variables, no statistically significant difference existed in IMV or in-hospital death between those with RSV and those unvaccinated for COVID-19 (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.82; 95%CI, 0.59-1.13; P=.22) or influenza (aOR, 1.20; 95% CI, 0.82-1.76; P=.35).1 Not surprisingly, when compared to vaccinated patients, those with RSV did have a statistically significant higher risk of IMV or in-hospital death. When compared to those vaccinated for COVID-19, the aOR for IMV or in-hospital death among those hospitalized with RSV was 1.38; (95% CI, 1.02-1.86; P=.03); and when compared to those vaccinated for influenza, the aOR was 2.81 (95% CI, 1.62-4.86; P<.001). In addition, patients with RSV had more than double the risk of receiving advanced respiratory support, when compared with vaccinated patients with COVID-19 (aOR, 2.03; 95% CI, 1.64-2.51) or vaccinated patients with influenza (aOR, 2.71; 95% CI, 1.89-3.87).1 Peak overall respiratory disease severity in patients with RSV was higher compared with the unvaccinated COVID-19 population (aOR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.27-1.86) and the unvaccinated influenza population (aOR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.18-185). This difference in severity was even higher when compared to the vaccinated populations (aOR, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.82-2.57 for the COVID-19 group; aOR, 2.40; 95% CI, 1.83-3.14 for the influenza group).1 “RSV can be a severe respiratory illness in adults, similar to COVID-19 and influenza,” says lead investigator, Diya Surie, MD, Coronavirus and Other Respiratory Viruses Division, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, at the CDC. “Before RSV vaccine introduction in the United States, disease caused by RSV was at least as severe as COVID-19 or influenza among hospitalized adults who were unvaccinated against their illness.” The authors noted a few limitations. First, no consideration was given to treatments with antiviral and immunomodulatory medications. These treatments may have affected observed severity for COVID-19 and influenza, for example. Since COVID-19 hospitalizations are routinely based on severity, and there were no routine treatments for RSV, this could have affected the populations studied. The authors confirmed that “the presented severity levels for COVID-19 and influenza represent a mix of patients who did and did not receive antiviral and immunomodulatory treatments.” Second, in that regard, the authors noted that it is possible that RSV was possibly preferentially detected in those who presented more severely ill and thus more likely to be tested.1 In conclusion, Dr. Surie believes that these findings, along with continued monitoring of vaccine safety and efficacy by the CDC, will provide guidance to clinicians advising their patients about the potential benefits of RSV vaccination. “By understanding the potential seriousness of disease caused by RSV, clinicians can better advise their patients at increased risk for severe disease on the importance of vaccination against it,” she says. “CDC monitors the safety of vaccines and is doing the same with the RSV vaccines to understand their effectiveness in preventing and reducing severe disease outcomes.” Published: August 06, 2024 Brett Moskowitz, MA, writes about medicine and, in 2008, founded Bowery Consulting, which specializes in the development of medical content for healthcare professionals.

The study, which is currently available on the medRxiv preprint* server, highlights the need to develop effective interventions against H5N1 HPAIV to prevent pathogen spillover. Image Credit: McKenzie Kizer / Shutterstock Background*Important notice: medRxiv publishes preliminary scientific reports that are not peer-reviewed and, therefore, should not be regarded as conclusive, guide clinical practice/health-related behavior, or treated as established information. H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza A viruses (HPAIV) have caused millions of deaths in wild birds and poultry across the world. Recently, these viruses have been identified in many animal species, with HPAIV H5N1 HA clade 2.3.3.4b being the most predominant type in these spillover events. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has recently detected H5N1 HPAIV infection in 172 cattle farms in 13 states. Four dairy farm and nine poultry farm workers have also been suspected to have these infections recently. Considering the seriousness of the situation, the current study was designed to investigate the presence of novel respiratory viruses in two Texas dairy farms. Study design The study was conducted in two dairy farms in Texas, where H5N1 HPAIV infection was recently detected in cattle. The farm owners invited the scientists to investigate, as they had a research proposal to study novel respiratory viruses in livestock farms in the United States and Mexico. A total of 17 farm workers were recruited in the study. They provided nasopharyngeal and serum samples for the analysis. Five out of 17 workers reported experiencing respiratory illnesses and using different medications for the condition. From both farms, a total of 39 cattle nasal swab samples and 14 milk samples were collected for molecular assays, cell and egg culture, and Sanger and next-generation sequencing to isolate and characterize respiratory viruses. Related StoriesStudy reveals high effectiveness of flu vaccines in children but highlights challenges with certain subtypesNew CDC report highlights disparities in flu hospitalization and vaccinationH5N1 bird flu is mutating fast and jumping to mammals - could the next pandemic be here?Three-hour bioaerosol samples were also collected from different farm regions to investigate the presence of novel viruses in the environment. Important observations The study detected H5N1 HPAIV in nine of 14 milk samples and one of 39 cattle nasal swab samples. However, none of the nasopharyngeal swabs collected from farm workers tested positive for influenza A viruses and coronaviruses. One nasal swab collected from a sick cow showed the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Among 14 serum samples collected from farm workers, two showed elevated levels of neutralizing antibodies against a recombinant influenza A H5N1 virus. Among 24 bioaerosol samples collected from both farms, none showed molecular evidence of influenza A and coronaviruses. H5N1-positive milk samples were further analyzed using Sanger sequencing and next-generation sequencing for viral characterization. The findings revealed that viruses are closely related to other recent Texas epizootic H5N1 strains of clade 2.3.4.4b. The mutational analysis revealed the presence of multiple common mutations across isolated viral genomes. These mutations are associated with viral virulence and propagation, host specificity shift, and drug resistance. Study significance The study highlights the presence of H5N1 HPAIV infections in cattle in two Texas dairy farms. Although the virus was detected only in one cattle nasal swab sample, about 64% of milk samples tested positive for H5N1 HPAIV. These findings indicate that although the virus is rapidly cleared from the nasal tissues, infected cattle can shed H5N1 HPAIV in milk for a prolonged period of time. Most importantly, the detection of anti-HPAIV neutralizing antibodies in farm workers highlights the possibility of previous infections that remained undetected during the acute infection phase. This highlights the possibility of underreporting of HPAIV infections in farm workers, which can subsequently lead to large outbreaks even outside farm worker communities. "I am very confident there are more people being infected than we know about," senior author Gregory Gray, MD, MPH, a UTMB infectious disease researcher, told NPR. "Largely, that's because our surveillance has been so poor." The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) decide whether to vaccinate farm workers against HPAIV based on surveillance data, which indicate a low prevalence of HPAIV infection. This low prevalence is due to low testing rates among farm workers. Many infections may remain undiagnosed among people who have been exposed to sick dairy cattle. "Maybe what we see isn't exactly the tip of the iceberg, but it's certainly not the whole story," said Richard Webby, director of the World Health Organization Collaborating Center for Influenza at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee. Studies identifying novel respiratory viruses are infrequently conducted in dairy farms because of the fear of business loss. As Gregory Gray mentioned, without collaborative efforts between the government and the livestock industry, the U.S. risks about this virus will remain in the dark. This highlights the need for collecting more comprehensive epidemiological data necessary to design future interventions against H5N1 HPAIV on cattle farms. *Important notice: medRxiv publishes preliminary scientific reports that are not peer-reviewed and, therefore, should not be regarded as conclusive, guide clinical practice/health-related behavior, or treated as established information.

The findings of the study, published in Emerging Microbes and Infections, offer an alternative approach to help mitigate the spread of IAV.IAV infections cause respiratory diseases, seasonal flu, occasional pandemics, and significant economic losses to birds and mammals. In humans, IAV infections also cause seasonal flu, resulting in 290,000 to 650,000 deaths annually. Previous studies identified transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) as a gene affecting the pathogenicity and infectivity of IAVs. Thus, the study aimed to develop pigs resistant to IAV infection using gene editing techniques.The researchers used CRISPR-Cas9 technology to knockout TMPRSS2. The results of the study showed that the TMPRSS2 knockout pigs had a low level of virus shedding on day 1 and no virus shedding was observed from days 2 to 5. Moreover, the study also showed that none of the gene-edited pigs were positive for the H1N1 CA04 virus from day 3 to 5.Similarly, no virus was reported to be present in nasal turbinates of H3N2 TX98-infected knockout pigs. These gene-edited pigs also showed lower virus titers than the wild-type pigs. The postmortem evaluation among the gene-edited pigs revealed that the infection caused by H1N1 CA04 resulted in less severe macroscopic pathology of the lungs compared to wild-type pigs.For more information, read the journal article from Emerging Microbes and Infections.

Learn More Transcript Transcript Unger: Hello and welcome to the AMA Update video and podcast. Today, we have our weekly look at the headlines with the AMA's Vice President of Science, Medicine and Public Health, Andrea Garcia. I'm Todd Unger, AMA's chief experience officer. Andrea, welcome back. Garcia: Thanks, Todd. It's great to be here. Unger: Well, one thing we didn't talk about last week was bird flu, but there have been some updates to discuss, including new CDC efforts to better protect farm workers. Andrea, tell us more about that. Garcia: Yeah, Todd, so it was early last week when we saw the CDC announced two new $5 million investments. And those are to help protect farm workers who are at heightened risk of exposure to highly pathogenic avian influenza or bird flu. The first is going to fund partner organizations, including the National Center for Farmworker Health, to support overall outreach and education efforts focused on farm worker safety and health. The second investment is going to go towards increased efforts to get the seasonal flu vaccine to U.S. livestock, dairy and poultry workers, and thus to control and prevent seasonal flu among this group in light of the ongoing H5N1 outbreaks. Unger: So, Andrea, how will offering seasonal flu vaccine help with bird flu? Garcia: Well, that's a great question, since we know the seasonal flu vaccine does not actually prevent infection from highly pathogenic avian influenza. However, it can reduce the prevalence and severity of seasonal flu, and it might reduce that very rare risk of having both seasonal flu and bird flu at the same time. Having dual infections, while rare, could theoretically result in genetic re-assortment of the two different influenza A viruses and lead to a new influenza A virus that has a different combination of genes, which could potentially pose a significant public health concern. Of course, preventing seasonal flu infection and severe disease outcomes is just good public health practice. This population, we know, typically has lower vaccination rates than the general public. While these vaccines will not be required for farm workers, reducing barriers to getting the vaccine and increasing uptake can help reduce that strain on rural health care systems in the fall and winter when we know more people are likely to have respiratory illnesses. The thinking is also that, if fewer people get seasonal flu in the fall and winter, we may be able to better detect if a person is sick with avian flu. This seasonal flu vaccine campaign for farm workers should be starting on or around October 1. So, it's certainly something we're going to continue to monitor on our end over the coming months. Unger: Thank you so much for that update. And before we leave the topic of bird flu, a new study was released last week, suggesting that bird flu cases in people may be going undetected. Andrea, tell us more about that and what it means. Garcia: So this study has not yet been peer reviewed. What was posted online last Wednesday, it was covered by Kaiser Family Foundation Health News. It was also reported on a CNN article on Friday. It basically confirms what we suspected, and that's highly pathogenic avian influenza cases are likely being underreported. The concern here is containment. Right now, we know of 13 human cases of bird flu related to this outbreak. All have been traced to direct contact with infected animals and were mild cases in which everyone recovered. If cases are going unreported, however, it becomes difficult to track if the virus is becoming more contagious, and a large surge of infections outside of that farm worker community would trigger the government's flu surveillance system. But by then, it would be too late. Unger: Really interesting. So Andrea, what did this study look at exactly? Garcia: So it looked for signs of prior undiagnosed infections and people who had been exposed to sick dairy cattle and who had become ill and recovered. They analyzed blood samples from 14 farm workers from two dairy farms that had outbreaks in Texas earlier this year, and they found antibodies in two of them. It's a small sample, but the research team is saying that it's the percentage that is concerning. It's a nearly 15% hit rate from only two dairy farms out of more than 170 with bird flu outbreaks in 13 states this year. One of the workers with antibodies had reportedly been taking medicine for a lingering cough. The other had reportedly recently recovered from a respiratory illness. She didn't know what had caused it but told researchers that untested farm workers around her had been sick, too. Unger: Wow. So what does that mean in the big picture? Garcia: Well, I think it means something that we already knew. We need more testing, and we also need better precautions. I think the good news here is both workers who tested positive for antibodies had symptoms, which supports an earlier Michigan study that showed asymptomatic cases of bird flu are rare. However, there are a lot of barriers to testing farm workers, even if they do have symptoms. We know many are reticent to seek care, because they don't have insurance, or they're worried about losing their employment if they get sick. According to a KFF analysis, about one-fifth of the workers on livestock farms are uninsured, and a similar share have household incomes of less than $40,000 a year. So we still certainly have a lot of work to do to instill trust, and that's something we can only do by getting farm owners on board. Unger: Well, just connecting our first part of the story here, perhaps, the CDC's new investments will help with that as well. Andrea, I want to turn now to another disease that we haven't talked about much in the past few weeks but has slowly been gaining ground here in the U.S., and that's the measles. Andrea, what's going on there? Garcia: Well, Todd, there was an article in U.S. News and World Report late last week that was based on CDC data, and the number of both cases and outbreaks of measles so far this year has tripled over last year, and we are only through July. If we look at those numbers, a total of 188 measles cases have been reported, and that's across 25 states, New York City and DC. And that's as of July 25. We only had 58 cases recorded in all of 2023. Almost all of the cases that were reported this year, about 43% have occurred in children under the age of five, and 32% were among individuals 20 and older. We know that approximately 95% of those cases have involved individuals who were either unvaccinated, had an unknown vaccination status, or who had only received one dose of the MMR vaccine. Unger: Well, that's very telling, because of course, the vaccine is extremely effective, right? Garcia: That's right. That vaccine is estimated to be 93% effective against measles after one dose, 97% effective after two doses, and it's not just cases that we're seeing increase. It's outbreaks too. So far, health officials have reported a total of 13 outbreaks, which involve three or more cases, compared to just four outbreaks in all of last year. We know that nearly two-thirds of measles cases this year have been associated with outbreaks, and the largest, which occurred at a migrant shelter right here in Chicago in March. Once we see vaccine uptake start to lag, we know that infection can spread quickly, and just as a reminder, measles is highly contagious. It can affect up to 90% of people who are unprotected if they come in contact was someone with the illness. Unger: And this is especially frustrating, because I think, at one point, we eliminated measles pretty much from the U.S. Is that right? Garcia: Yeah, we did. Measles was declared eliminated in this country back in 2000, and that, I think, was thanks in large part, to the success of an extensive vaccination program that included states requiring kindergartners to get the MMR vaccine before being allowed to go to public school. Since then, vaccination, we know, has started to lag, and there's been that uptick in cases globally. Both of those have contributed to the increasing numbers that we're seeing now. Airports are one of the most common high-risk areas for exposure since people are coming into the country after traveling internationally. The bottom line is we've really taken a step backwards here. Measles is not a disease anyone wants, and it can lead to very serious complications. And physicians can certainly help by continuing to urge their patients who are not yet vaccinated to begin the two-dose series as soon as possible. Unger: All right, well, thank you for that update. Andrea, to finish up this week's update, I want to check in on another virus that we haven't talked much about in the last few weeks, and that is Mpox. What's the news there? Garcia: Yeah, there is a lot of news here. In fact, over the weekend, it was reported that the WHO chief is considering convening an expert committee to advise on whether the growing Mpox outbreak in Africa should be declared a public health emergency of international concern. That's the highest alarm the WHO can sound, and that WHO director can declare an emergency on the advice of a committee of experts in the field. A public health emergency of international concern really has only been declared seven times since 2009, so over H1N1, swine flu, polio virus, ebola, Zika virus, ebola again, and then COVID-19 and Mpox. Unger: So what's driving the need to possibly sound an alarm again? Garcia: Well, since last September, cases have surged in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and that's due to a more deadly clade of the virus that has also recently now been detected in nearby African countries. While the UN Health Agency, the Africa Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and local governments and partners are increasing their response to the outbreak, the WHO director said that more funding and support are needed. And to put it into his words, the virus can and must be contained with intensified public health measures, including surveillance, community engagement, treatment and targeted deployment of vaccines for those at higher risk of infection. Unger: All right, and that's something we'll monitor continuously as it unfolds. That wraps up this week. Thank you as always for being here, Andrea, and for sharing the information.

During pneumonia, host immune inflammation regulation involves microbiota in the intestine and glycolysis in the lung tissues. In the clinical guidelines for pneumonia treatment in China, Ma Xing Shi Gan Decoction (MXSG) is a commonly prescribed traditional Chinese medicine formulation with significant efficacy, however, it remains unclear whether its specific mechanism of action is related to the regulation of intestinal microbiota structure and lung tissue glycolysis.Objective: This study aimed to investigate the mechanism of action of MXSG in an animal model of influenza virus-induced pneumonia. Specifically, we aimed to elucidate how MXSG modulates intestinal microbiota structure and lung tissue glycolysis to exert its therapeutic effects on pneumonia.Methods: We established a mouse model of influenza virus-induced pneumoni, and treated with MXSG. We observed changes in inflammatory cytokine levels and conducted 16S rRNA gene sequencing to assess the intestinal microbiota structure and function. Additionally, targeted metabolomics was performed to analyze lung tissue glycolytic metabolites, and Western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were performed to assess glycolysis-related enzymes, lipopolysaccharides (LPSs), HIF-1a, and macrophage surface markers. Correlation analysis was conducted between the LPS and omics results to elucidate the relationship between intestinal microbiota and lung tissue glycolysis in pneumonia animals under the intervention of Ma Xing Shi Gan Decoction.Results: MXSG reduced the abundance of Gram-negative bacteria in the intestines, such as Proteobacteria and Helicobacter, leading to reduced LPS content in the serum and lungs. This intervention also suppressed HIF-1a activity and lung tissue glycolysis metabolism, decreased the number of M1-type macrophages, and increased the number of M2-type macrophages, effectively alleviating lung damage caused by influenza virus-induced pneumonia.Conclusion: MXSG can alleviate glycolysis in lung tissue, suppress M1-type macrophage activation, promote M2-type macrophage activation, and mitigate inflammation in lung tissue. This therapeutic effect appears to be mediated by modulating gut microbiota and reducing endogenous LPS production in the intestines. This study demonstrates the therapeutic effects of MXSG on pneumonia and explores its potential mechanism, thus providing data support for the use of traditional Chinese medicine in the treatment of respiratory infectious diseases.1 IntroductionIn clinical practice, influenza virus pneumonia is a prevalent respiratory disease that affects approximately 5%–15% of the global population annually, causing 290,000 to 650,000 deaths (Moore et al., 2021). Type A H1N1 is one of the most common influenza viruses (Jiang et al., 2020). The influenza virus can trigger an excessive inflammatory response and an immune imbalance within the body, ultimately leading to a cytokine storm and severe damage to lung tissues, resulting in pneumonia. Currently, the prevention and treatment of pneumonia caused by influenza virus primarily rely on vaccines, antiviral medications, glucocorticoids, and symptomatic supportive care; however, owing to factors such as viral mutations and drug resistance development, the prevention and treatment of influenza virus pneumonia are limited.Ma Xing Shi Gan Decoction (MXSG) is an ancient Chinese medicine prescription with a long history of use in treating pneumonia (Wang et al., 2011). It consists of four medicinal botanical drugs: Ephedra sinica Stapf (Ma Huang), seeds of Prunus mandshurica (Maxinm.) Koehne (Ku Xingren), the mineral medicine gypsum (Shi Gao), and Glycyrrhiza glabra L (Gan Cao). The names of all plants used in this article were verified at http://www.worldfloraonline.org on 16 October 2023. In clinical practice in China, MXSG has demonstrated significant efficacy, particularly in alleviating symptoms such as high fever, cough, wheezing, chest tightness, and chest pain associated with acute pneumonia. Recent studies on the pharmacological effects and mechanisms of MXSG have revealed that it can regulate the levels of inflammatory factors and pattern recognition receptors in the body (Ma et al., 2014; Shen and Yin, 2021); however, its specific mechanism of action remains unclear.In recent years, treating respiratory diseases by modulating the gut microbiota has received increasing attention (Wang et al., 2022). Modulating and optimizing the composition of gut microbiota can serve as a potential therapeutic strategy to alleviate the severity and symptoms of viral pneumonia. Viral pneumonia can lead to an imbalance in gut microbiota and an increase in pathogenic bacteria (Gu et al., 2020). Preliminary research conducted by our team has identified irregularities in the gut microbiota structure during pneumonia (Bai et al., 2020). The gut microbiota plays a significant role in regulating host glycolysis. Research has demonstrated that intestinal Akkermansia muciniphila and its metabolite pentadecanoic acid can inhibit glycolysis by antagonizing the activity of FUBP1 (Xu et al., 2024). Glycolysis, one of the primary energy metabolism pathways in organisms, plays a critical role in regulating the inflammatory response. For instance, immune cells primarily rely on glycolysis to provide the energy required during the peak of inflammation (Soto-Heredero et al., 2020); Influenza virus can exacerbate inflammatory responses in lung tissue by promoting glycolysis in macrophages (Zhu et al., 2021). HIF-1α regulates the immune metabolic phenotype of macrophages (Evans et al., 2021). Herbal treatment in influenza A has the effect of regulating gut microbiota, reducing viral load in the lungs, and alleviating inflammatory damage (Deng et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2022). Ephedra sinica Stapf polysaccharide extracted from E. sinica Stapf can enhance the abundance of Lactobacillales and Bifidobacteriaceae, potentially indicating a significant target for the treatment of influenza virus infection (Liu et al., 2020). However, whether MXSG exerts its therapeutic effects on pneumonia by regulating the “gut microbiota-lung glycolysis” axis requires further investigation.Therefore, we aimed to establish a mouse model of influenza virus-induced pneumonia through intranasal infection with type A Hemagglutinin 1 Neuraminidase 1 (H1N1) influenza virus. MXSG was administered orally. By observing the therapeutic effects of MXSG on lung damage in the animal model and its impact on gut microbiota structure and lung glycolysis, we aimed to elucidate the mechanism underlying the treatment effect of MXSG against influenza virus-induced pneumonia.2 Materials and methods2.1 Animals and virusesExperimental animals: We purchased 50 male BALB/c mice aged 6–8 weeks and weighing 20 ± 2 g from Sibeifu (Beijing) Biotechnology Co., Ltd. [License No. SCXK (Jing) 2019–0010], under animal batch number 110324221105336075. They were raised in the P2 laboratory of the Experimental Animal Center of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention [License No. SYXK (Jing) 2020–0033]. All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the guidelines of Animal Welfare and Ethics of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The protocols described in the present study received approval from the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention of Viral diseases (approval ID: 20220624076).Virus strain: The mouse lung-adapted strain of type A H1N1 influenza virus (A/PR/8/34) was provided by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, with an LD50 of 1 × 10−4.5/50 µL. The mice were intranasally infected with influenza virus (A/PR/8/34) at 50 μL of l×LD50/mouse or 50 μL of saline.2.2 DrugsMXSG was prepared in accordance with the standard of “Pharmacopoeia of the People’s Republic of China.” Each prescription consisted of E. sinica Stapf (Lot no.: 2110012S, 9 g), seeds of P. mandshurica (Maxinm.) Koehne (Lot no.: 2110006S, 9 g), the mineral medicine gypsum (Lot no.: 2110001S, 18 g), and G. glabra L (Lot no.: 2109018C, 6 g). The formula was prepared as granules (Huaren Sannine, Ltd), with a granules to crude botanical drugs ratio of 1:8.75. Oseltamivir phosphate capsules [Batch No. M1050] at 75 mg oseltamivir × 10 capsules were produced by Roche Pharmaceuticals, Ltd., Italy. 2-Deoxy-d-glucose (2DG) [Batch No. 1758, 9500] at 1 g was produced by INALCO.The dosages of the drugs were converted according to the standard body weight of adults and the mouse dose conversion factor of 9.1. MXSG granules and oseltamivir phosphate capsules were fully dissolved in distilled water before use, and suspensions with concentrations of 72.8 mg/mL and 2.5 mg/mL were administrated once a day by oral gavage, respectively. The glycolysis inhibitor 2DG was fully dissolved in physiological saline to prepare a solution with a concentration of 50 mg/mL for intraperitoneal injection.2.3 Grouping, modeling, and administrationAfter 1 week of adaptive feeding, the mice were randomly divided into five groups, each consisting of 10 mice: control group, influenza virus infection group (model group), MXSG treatment group (MXSG group), oseltamivir phosphate treatment group (oseltamivir group), and 2DG treatment group (2DG group). Owing to its competitive inhibition of hexokinase, 2DG, a glucose analog, is often employed as a glycolysis inhibitor (Barban and Schulze, 1961; Pelicano et al., 2006). Except for the control group, the other mice were intranasally inoculated with 50 µL of virus fluid containing 1 unit of LD50 under mild isoflurane anesthesia to establish the model. The control group received the same method but with 50 µL of phosphate-buffered saline administered intranasally.Starting from the second day after modeling, the Chinese medicine treatment group received MXSG at 0.2 mL (i.g.), the oseltamivir group received oseltamivir phosphate capsules at 0.2 mL (i.g.), and the 2DG group received 2DG at 0.2 mL (i.p.) once daily for six consecutive days. Both the control group and model group received an equivalent volume of distilled water by oral gavage.2.4 Ma Xing Shi Gan Decoction identification detected by UPLC-MS/MSThe concentrated water of Ma Xing Shi Gan Decoction are freeze-dried by vacuum freeze-dryer (Scientz-100F). Dissolve 100 mg lyophilized powder in 1.2 mL 70% methanol. Vortex for 30 s, repeating five more times every 30 min. Chill the sample overnight at 4°C. The UPLC-ESI-MS/MS system was utilized to analyze the sample extracts (UPLC: SHIMADZU Nexera X2 www.shimadzu.com.cn/; MS, Applied Biosystems 4500 Q TRAP, www.appliedbiosystems.com.cn/). The analytical parameters were optimized as follows: Agilent SB-C18 column (1.8 µm, 2.1 × 100 mm) was employed, with a mobile phase comprising solvent A (pure water +0.1% formic acid) and solvent B (acetonitrile +0.1% formic acid). A gradient elution program was initiated at 95% A and 5% B, linearly transitioning to 5% A and 95% B over 9 min, held for 1 min, then adjusted back to 95% A and 5% B within 1.10 min, maintained for 2.9 min. The flow rate was 0.35 mL/min, column temperature set at 40°C, and injection volume was 4 μL. The effluent was directed to an ESI-QTRAP-MS for analysis. LIT and QQQ scans were performed on the AB4500 Q TRAP UPLC/MS/MS System, a triple quadrupole-linear ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with an ESI Turbo Ion-Spray interface. Operating in both positive and negative ion modes, the system was controlled by Analyst 1.6.3 software from AB Sciex. Key ESI source settings included a turbo spray ion source at 550°C, ion spray voltages of 5500 V (positive) and −4500 V (negative), and optimized gas flows for source gas I (50 psi), gas II (60 psi), and curtain gas (25.0 psi). High collision-activated dissociation (CAD) was employed. Instrument tuning and calibration were conducted using polypropylene glycol solutions at 10 and 100 μmol/L, respectively, in QQQ and LIT modes.2.5 Sample collection and detectionOn the seventh day after virus infection, which corresponded to the sixth day of treatment, the mice were weighed and then collected for heart blood samples under isoflurane anesthesia. EP tubes were used to collect blood samples, which were then centrifuged, and the upper serum samples were collected and stored in a freezer at −80°C. After weighing the mouse lungs, the left lung was immersed in a 4% paraformaldehyde solution, and the right lung and cecal content samples were placed in cryotubes and stored in a −80 °C freezer.2.5.1 Lung index and histopathological analysisThe method of calculating the lung index is as follows: lung mass/body mass × 100%. The lung tissue injury was observed by histopathology. The fixed lung tissues were dehydrated and embedded, cut into 0.5 µm sections, and subjected to hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. Lung tissue pathological morphology was observed under a 200× light microscope. A pathologist blinded to the treatment conducted the histological assessments. The score was graded according to the sum of the score for degree of damage such as hemorrhage, the number of infiltration cells, and edema. Each histological characteristic was assigned a score ranging from 0 to 3.2.5.2 ELISA detection of inflammatory factors and LPS levelsEach group was randomly selected, and six samples were chosen. Lung samples were homogenized using a homogenizer and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min. Serum was obtained by centrifuging blood samples at 4°C and 3000 rpm for 15 min. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-10, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels were detected using an MS Mouse TNF-α ELISA Kit (Catalog No. E-MSEL-M0002, Elabscience), MS Mouse IL-1β ELISA Kit (Catalog No. E-MSEL-M0003, Elabscience), MS Mouse IL-6 ELISA Kit (Catalog No. E-MSEL-M0001, Elabscience), MS Mouse IL-10 ELISA Kit (Catalog No. E-MSEL-M0031, Elabscience), and Mouse (LPS) ELISA Kit (Catalog No. CSB-E13066m, Huamei).2.5.3 Targeted metabolomics analysis of lung tissue glycolysis levelsLung tissue samples from six randomly selected mice from each group were used. Approximately 80 mg of lung tissue was combined with 200 µL of distilled water and homogenized using a FastPrep-24 5G homogenizer. Afterward, 800 µL of methanol-acetonitrile solution (1:1, v/v) was added, followed by 10 µL succinic acid-d6 (internal standard). The mixture was vortexed for 60 s, sonicated twice at low temperature for 30 min each, then placed in a −20 °C freezer for 1 h to precipitate proteins. After centrifugation at 4°C and 14000 × g for 20 min, the supernatant was collected and freeze-dried. The samples were separated using an Agilent 1290 Infinity LC system and analyzed using a 5500QTRAP mass spectrometer (AB SCIEX). Metabolites were identified using Multiquant software, which extracted chromatographic peak areas and retention times. Retention times were corrected using standard substances of energy metabolites (Robinson et al., 2020). The differential metabolites in glycolysis were screened by targeting metabolomics in lung tissue.2.5.4 Lactate productionMeasurement of lactate concentration was utilized with a lactate Assay kit (A019-2-1, Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Research Institute) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The main reaction mixture contains a 2 μL sample solution, 20 μL enzyme working solution, and 20 μL color developer. The sample was incubated at 37°C for 10 min, and the absorbance was measured at wavelength of 530 µm.2.5.5 Western blot for lung tissue proteinsFor each group, lung tissue samples from three randomly selected mice were used. Lung tissue samples were thawed, lysed, and homogenized with RIPA lysis buffer to extract proteins. Protein concentration was determined using the bicinchoninic acid method. Uniform amounts of protein were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred onto PVDF membranes, and blocked with 5% skim milk at room temperature for 2 h. The membranes were then probed with primary antibodies against GAPDH (1:1000), NP (1:2000), MPO (1:3000), GLUT1 (1:1000), HK2 (1:10,000), PKM2 (1:1000), LDHA (1:5000), HIF-1α (1:1000), CD80 (1:2000), and CD206 (1:2000) overnight at 4°C. After three consecutive 10-min washes with TBST, the membranes were incubated with secondary antibodies at room temperature for 90 min. Following three additional TBST washes for 10 min each, the membranes were subjected to an ECL reaction, and images were captured. ImageJ software was used to analyze the grayscale values and quantify the protein expression levels of myeloperoxidase (MPO), glucose transporters1 (GLUT1), hexokinase II (HK2), pyruvate kinase 2 (PKM2), lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1α), cluster of differentiation 80 (CD80), and cluster of differentiation 206 (CD206) in lung tissue.2.5.6 16S rRNA gene sequencing of gut microbiota structureFor each group, cecal contents from six randomly selected mice were used. The cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CATB) method was employed to extract genomic DNA from the samples, and the purity and concentration of DNA were assessed through 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. The V3+V4 variable region was PCR-amplified using primers 341F (5′-CCTAYGGGRBGCASCAG-3′) and 806R (5′-GGACTACNNGGGTATCTAAT-3′). Library construction was carried out using the NEB Next Ultra DNA Library Prep Kit, and the constructed libraries were quantified using an Agilent 5400 and Q-PCR. After library qualification, sequencing was performed on a NovaSeq 6000 sequencer. Quality control, denoising, merging, and operational taxonomic unit (OTU) generation were performed using the DADA2 plugin in QIIME2. Representative sequences of ASVs were aligned to the Greengenes Database using the QIIME2 feature-classifier plugin to obtain species annotation information (DeSantis et al., 2006). The proportions of sequence numbers at each group’s phylum and genus levels were calculated based on OTU absolute abundance and annotation information. Alpha and beta diversity analyses were mainly completed using the QIIME2 diversity plugin. Chao and Shannon indices were analyzed using the Wilcox Test method, and Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA) was performed using the Weighted Unifrac method. Linear Discriminant Analysis Effect Size (LDA) was employed to analyze the variation in microbial groups between the groups, with a discriminant feature threshold of 2.0.2.5.7 Immunofluorescence detection of macrophage markers in lung tissueParaffin embedding was performed on three random lung tissue samples from each group. Antigen retrieval of lung tissue sections was performed using EDTA buffer (0.01M, pH 9.0), followed by blocking with normal goat serum for 30 min. The sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies against F4/80 (1:200), CD206 (1:100), and CD80 (1:100). After washing with PBST, the sections were incubated with fluorescent (Cy3)-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (1:100) and fluorescent (FITC)-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG for 1 h the following day. Finally, DAPT was added and left to incubate in the absence of light for 5 min. Finally, a fluorescence microscope was used to observe and document the fluorescence.2.5.8 Detection of M1/M2 macrophage markers by flow cytometryFor each sample, 100 μL of cell suspension was taken and mixed with 1 μL of each fluorescently labeled antibody, including CD45FITC, CD11bV450, F4/80 PE-Cy7, CD86PE, and CD206PE. The mixture was incubated at room temperature in the dark for 20 min. Subsequently, the cells were mixed with PBS and centrifuged at 300 g for 5 min, with this step being repeated twice.

Top 18 chemical metabolites in MXSG detected by UPLC-MS/MS.3.2 Improvement in inflammatory state of influenza virus-induced pneumonia mice by MXSGCompared to the control group, on the seventh day of modeling, the model group exhibited a decrease in body weight (Figure 2A) and an increase in the lung weight index (Figure 2B), and HE staining revealed damaged lung cell membranes, loss of alveolar tissue structure, thickened alveolar walls, and substantial infiltration of inflammatory cells in the alveolar cavity (Figure 2F). The lung pathological scores were higher (Figure 2G). The protein expression of MPO, NP increased (Figures 2C–E). The levels of inflammatory factors IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α were increased (Figures 2H–J, L–N), whereas IL-10 was reduced (Figure 2K, O). These findings indicated the successful establishment of the influenza virus-induced pneumonia model.Figure 2 Figure 2. Inflammatory state of the model animals. (A) Animal body weight (n = 10).

(O) Serum IL-10 (n = 6). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001.Compared to the model group, both the MXSG and oseltamivir groups showed an increase in body weight (Figure 2A) and a decrease in lung weight index (Figure 2B) on the seventh day of modeling. The lung morphology of the animals in these groups was intact, with fewer infiltrating inflammatory cells in the alveoli and significant improvement in lung tissue pathology (Figure 2F). The lung pathological scores were lower (Figure 2G). The expression of MPO, NP protein decreased (Figures 2C–E). Serum inflammatory factors IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α decreased (Figure 2H–J, L–N), whereas IL-10 increased (Figure 2K, O). This suggests that MXSG can effectively treat influenza virus-infected pneumonia, inhibit viral replication, and alleviate systemic inflammatory responses. Its efficacy is comparable to oseltamivir.The 2DG group exhibited a lower lung weight index (Figure 2B) than that of the model group. The lung alveolar morphology was relatively intact, with thicker alveolar walls and increased infiltration of inflammatory cells in the alveolar cavity (Figure 2F). The lung pathological scores were lower (Figure 2G). The expression of MPO, NP protein decreased (Figures 2C–E). Inflammatory factors IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α decreased (Figure 2H–J, L–N), whereas IL-10 increased (Figure 2K, O). This suggests that inhibiting lung tissue glycolysis can suppress viral replication and improve the inflammatory response in influenza virus-induced pneumonia mice.3.3 Effects of MXSG on glucose metabolism in influenza virus-induced pneumonia miceThe treatment of influenza virus-infected pneumonia with MXSG is effective, and glycolysis inhibitors can alleviate inflammation by regulating lung tissue glycolysis. Therefore, we further examined the metabolic levels and key regulatory proteins of lung tissue glycolysis after treatment with MXSG. Targeted metabolomics results indicated that, compared to the control group, the model group had increased levels of glucose-6-phosphate, fructose-6-phosphate, lactate, malic acid, flavin mononucleotide (FMN), fumarate, thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), and the levels of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) decreased (Figure 3A, C). Compared to the model group, the MXSG group showed decreased levels of glucose-6-phosphate, fructose-6-phosphate, FMN, and malic acid. In contrast, the levels of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP+) and ATP increased (Figure 3B, D). Consistently, Using biochemical methods to detect lactate levels, the results showed that serum lactate and lactate in lung tissue homogenates were significantly higher in the model group compared to the control group (Figure 3E, F); MXSG can reduce the level of lactate (Figure 3E, F). Additionally, we examined glycolysis-related proteins. Compared to the control group, the model group exhibited decreased levels of GLUT1 protein but increased levels of HK2, PKM2, and LDHA proteins (Figure 3G, H); however, MXSG reversed this phenomenon (Figure 3G, H). An equivalent amount of glucose produced less ATP through glycolysis compared to oxidative phosphorylation. Our results showed an increase in glycolysis-related products in the lung tissues of influenza virus-induced pneumonia mice, a decrease in ATP, and an increase in glycolytic enzyme expression. MXSG reversed these effects, suggesting that lung tissue glucose metabolism in influenza virus-induced pneumonia mice may shift from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis, and MXSG may alter the glucose metabolism pattern in pneumonia by transitioning lung tissue glucose metabolism from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation.Figure 3 Figure 3.

Regulating the immune response can alleviate viral pneumonia by improving the gut microbiota (Cox and Tregoning 2018; Jung et al., 2017). Therefore, the effect of MXSG on the gut microbiota was observed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The results indicated that there was no notable disparity in the Chao1 index among the control, model, and MXSG groups (Figure 4A); however, the Shannon index of the model group surpassed that of the control group (Figure 4B). The PCoA showed that the control and model groups were dispersed, with a significant shift in the MXSG group (Figures 4C, D). This indicates that the gut microbiota of influenza virus-induced pneumonia mice undergoes changes, and MXSG can adjust its gut microbiota composition.Figure 4 Figure 4. Changes in gut microbiota (n = 6). (A) Chao1 index. (B) Shannon index. (C, D) PCoA based on Weighted Unifrac distance. (E) Community distribution of gut microbiota at the phylum level.

(H) LEfSe analysis of different biomarkers and the histogram of the distribution of LDA values between model and MXSG groups. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01.To further explore the differences in gut microbiota among the control, model, and MXSG groups, we analyzed the differential species of gut microbiota at the phylum and genus levels. At the phylum level, the model group displayed characteristic changes compared to the control group, with a rise in the prevalence of Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria, along with a decline in the abundance of Firmicutes. MXSG reversed this trend (Figure 4E). At the genus level, the model group showed reduced levels of Lactobacillus and Rikenella and increased levels of Fusobacterium, Butyricicoccus, Allobaculum, Paraprevotella, Parabacteroides, Ruminococcus, Prevotella, Akkermansia, Oscillospira, Bacteroides, Bilophila, Sutterella, and Bifidobacterium compared to the control group (Figures 4F, G). Based on the significant changes in the gut microbiota of influenza virus-induced pneumonia mice, MXSG increased the levels of Lactobacillus, Candidatus Arthromitus, and Clostridium and decreased the levels of AF12, Helicobacter, Ruminococcus, and Parabacteroides (Figures 4F, H). These results suggest that MXSG can reduce the abundance of pathogenic bacteria and increase the abundance of beneficial bacteria.3.5 Association analysis between gut microbiota and glycolysisBased on the results of gut microbiota detected by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, viral infection can increase the abundance of Gram-negative bacteria, such as Parabacteroides, Prevotellaceae_Prevotella, and Bacteroides in the Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria phyla, while MXSG can reduce the abundance of Gram-negative bacteria, such as Helicobacter and Parabacteroides. Gram-negative bacteria’s cell walls are mainly composed of LPS and have a certain pathogenicity, which can induce immune cell glycolysis reprogramming and thus regulate the body’s inflammatory response (Mills et al., 2016; Pan et al., 2022).Our findings revealed significant elevations in both serum and lung tissue LPS levels in the model group compared to the control group; however, after MXSG administration, these levels significantly decreased (Figure 5A). To explore the relationship between LPS, gut microbiota, and lung metabolic substances, we conducted Spearman’s correlation analysis. In Figures 5A, B correlation pattern between various microbial species and specific glycometabolites has been observed. Specifically, we found that Rseburia negatively correlates with glucose-6-phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate, Ureibacilus negatively correlates with dihydroxyacetone phosphate, while Bifidobacterium, Butyricicoccus, and Facklamia negatively correlate with 3-phosphoglyceraldehyde and phosphoenolpyruvate. Conversely, Rikenella and Adlercreutzia positively correlate with 3-phosphoglyceraldehyde and phosphoenolpyruvate. Figure 5C illustrates that LPS in serum and lung tissue exhibited a negative correlation with the genera Rikenella, Lactobacillus, and Roseburia and showed a positive correlation with the genera Prevotellaceae_Prevotella, Akkermansia, Parabacteroides, Paraprevotella, Butyricicoccus, Buchnera, Sutterella, Oscillospira, and Allobaculum. This suggests that an intricate interaction exists between gut microbiota and LPS in serum and lung tissue. Figure 5D shows that LPS in serum and lung tissue was positively correlated with lactate, pyruvate, glucose-6-phosphate, and fructose-6-phosphate. These results indicate a certain connection between LPS in serum and lung tissue, gut microbiota, and lung metabolic substances. MXSG possibly treats influenza virus-induced pneumonia by regulating gut microbiota, LPS, and lung tissue glucose metabolism.Figure 5 Figure 5. Correlation analysis and macrophage activation in lung tissue. (A) Levels of LPS in serum and lung tissue (n = 6). (B) Correlation heatmap between gut microbiota and lung glucose metabolism.

Using Western blotting, we assessed the expression levels of HIF-1a, CD80, and CD206 proteins. Compared to the control group, the model group exhibited increased protein expression of HIF-1a and CD80, while CD206 protein expression decreased. After administering MXSG, HIF-1a, and CD80, protein expression decreased, and CD206 protein expression increased (Figure 5E). Immunofluorescence staining of lung tissues and flow cytometry analysis indicated an increase in M1-type macrophage activation in the lung tissue of influenza virus-induced pneumonia mice (Figures 5F–H, L) and a reduction in M2-type macrophage activation (Figures 5I–L). MXSG partially inhibited M1 macrophage activation (Figures 5F–H, L) and promoted M2 macrophage activation (Figures 5I–L). These results suggest that MXSG may regulate macrophage polarization by reducing HIF-1a expression, which is consistent with the earlier research results (Figure 3), which demonstrated the inhibition of glycolysis and promotion of oxidative phosphorylation.4 DiscussionMXSG is a commonly used clinical treatment for respiratory infectious diseases (Yue and Ni, 1990; Chen et al., 2015). Research has demonstrated its multiple pharmacological mechanisms, including antiviral activity against influenza (Hsieh et al., 2012), inhibition of respiratory syncytial virus replication (Chen et al., 2015), and alleviation of acute lung injury (Zhu et al., 2023). Our previous studies have indicated that MXSG possesses antiviral properties, regulates immune-inflammatory responses, mitigates lung injury, and can modulate energy metabolism products in pneumonia-afflicted lung tissues (Li et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2020).The relative content of MXSG of 18 major chemical metabolites exceeded 10,000,000. Of the 18 chemical metabolites, 9 were flavonoids. Earlier research suggested that flavonoids have the ability to hinder influenza and alleviate acute lung injury caused by H1N1(Bang et al., 2018; Ling et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2020). Ephedrine, the most abundant chemical metabolite in MXSG, can suppress the replication of influenza virus. Together, these studies suggest that the metabolites of MXSG have an anti-influenza effect. In this study, MXSG reduced the expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6, elevated the expression level of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, improved lung tissue inflammatory injury, and demonstrated efficacy comparable to that of oseltamivir.The gut microbiota play a critical role in maintaining normal immune function and ameliorating lung injury. The gut microbiota composition contributes to the regulation of the differentiation balance of CD4+ helper T lymphocytes, subsequently minimizing excessive inflammatory damage during the advanced stages of IAV infection (Ou et al., 2023). The oral administration of Bacteroides dorei elicited a rapid increase in the expression of type 1 IFNs during the initial phase of infection (on day 3), leading to a significant reduction in the viral load in the lungs. Conversely, during the later stages of infection (on day 7), it mitigated the levels of type 1 IFNs and other pro-inflammatory factors, thereby contributing to the enhancement of tissue repair processes (Song et al., 2021). Preserving the balance of gut microbiota is essential to maintaining the integrity of the intestinal mucosal barrier. This study demonstrated that influenza virus infection led to an increase in the abundance of Rikenella, Proteobacteria, and Parabacteroides and reduced the abundance of Lactobacillus. MXSG contributed to enhancing the relative abundance of Clostridium, Candidatus Arthromitus and Lactobacillus while reducing the relative abundance of Proteobacteria and Parabacteroides in the gut. Clostridium orbiscindens, as a specific species within the genus Clostridium, produces desaminotyrosine and protects against influenza by enhancing type I interferon signaling and reducing lung immunopathology (Steed et al., 2017). As one of the primary representatives of Gram-negative bacteria, the Proteobacteria phylum harbors bacterial outer membranes enriched with LPS components, contributing significantly as one of the major sources of gut-derived LPS. LPS also possesses the potential to further induce dysbiosis in the gut microbiota, subsequently leads to a significant increase in the abundance of the Proteobacteria phylum (Qiu et al., 2023). Lactobacillus can reinforce tight junction function and protect intestinal barrier function through various mechanisms such as inducing mucus production, regulating cell cytoskeleton, and phosphorylation of tight junction proteins (Sengupta et al., 2013). Therefore, we hypothesized that influenza virus infection may disrupt the gut microbiota structure, thereby damaging the intestinal mucosal barrier. MXSG may restore the physical barrier of the intestinal mucosa by increasing the abundance of beneficial bacteria such as lactic acid bacteria. Influenza virus infection increases the number of Proteobacteria and decreases the abundance of Firmicutes (Groves et al., 2018), which aligns with our research results. MXSG increased the abundance of Firmicutes and reduced the abundance of Proteobacteria, including Parabacteroides and Helicobacter.The evidence demonstrates that specific microbial metabolites, such as N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (Hu et al., 2023), short chain fatty acids (Niu et al., 2023; Hu et al., 2024), and valine (Zhang et al., 2020), can alleviate influenza virus-induced acute lung injury through diverse mechanisms. Meanwhile, LPS derived from intestinal Gram-negative bacteria can induce the activation of inflammatory corpuscles in the lung, exacerbating inflammatory damage to lung tissues (Jin et al., 2021). Bacteroidetes is the largest class of bacteria among Gram-negative bacteria in the gut and is a major source of endogenous LPS (Ferro et al., 2020; Candelli et al., 2021). Our study results showed that influenza virus infection increased LPS levels in serum and lung tissue, while MXSG reduced LPS levels. Endogenous LPS levels are closely related to the degree of intestinal injury. When the intestinal mucosal barrier is damaged and permeability increases, LPS can transverse the intestinal mucosa, enter the bloodstream, and reach target organs through the circulatory system (Fu et al., 2022; Drummer et al., 2023). Therefore, we further examined the correlation between LPS and gut microbiota in this study. The results revealed that LPS in serum and lung tissue was positively correlated with Parabacteroides and negatively correlated with Lactobacillus. Therefore, we speculate that MXSG may restore the intestinal mucosal barrier function by increasing the abundance of Lactobacillus and reducing the abundance of Gram-negative bacteria such as Parabacteroides, thereby decreasing LPS in serum and lung tissue.Different bacterial components and their metabolites can affect pulmonary glycolysis (Machado et al., 2022). We performed a correlation analysis between gut microbiota and glycolytic products, and the results showed that Ureibacilus negatively correlates with dihydroxyacetone phosphate. Ureibacilus belongs to the phylum Firmicutes. Firmicutes exhibits regulatory effects on the glycolysis (Zhang et al., 2024). LPS plays a significant role in promoting glycolysis in lung tissue. LPS mediates pulmonary tissue glycolysis through the regulation of the MKP-1/MAPK pathway (Li et al., 2023). Zhong et al. found that LPS mediated an increase in lung tissue glycolysis via HIF-1α, subsequently activating the NLRP3 inflammasome, thus promoting lung tissue injury (Zhong et al., 2023). We conducted a correlation analysis between LPS and glycolytic products, and the results showed that LPS was positively correlated with pulmonary glycolytic products such as lactate, pyruvate, glucose-6-phosphate, and fructose-6-phosphate, indicating a correlation between LPS and glycolysis. HIF-1a, a key protein regulating glycolysis (Wheaton and Chandel, 2011), maintains glycolytic flux by increasing the expression of glycolytic enzymes such as PKM2, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1), and LDHA (Sun et al., 2019). In the context of influenza virus-induced pneumonia, there are notable interstitial changes characterized by exudation and thickening of alveolar septa. These changes restrict oxygen exchange, leading to an overexpression of HIF-1a induced by hypoxia. Under normoxic conditions, the influenza virus can elevate HIF-1a expression by impeding host cell proteasome function (Ren et al., 2019). In the present study, we observed an upregulation of HIF-1a expression in the lung tissue of mice with influenza virus-induced pneumonia, and MXSG administration reduced HIF-1a expression. Notably, influenza virus-induced glycolysis relies on the activation of HIF-1a (Ren et al., 2021). By inhibiting the glycolytic pathway, glucose metabolism can shift towards oxidative phosphorylation. Our study’s findings revealed an increase in the activity of glycolytic enzymes such as HK2, PKM2, and LDHA in lung tissue, along with elevated levels of glycolytic products, including glucose-6-phosphate, fructose-6-phosphate, and lactate. These results are consistent with prior research (Ritter et al., 2010; Petiot et al., 2011; Smallwood et al., 2017); however, the administration of MXSG inhibited glycolysis. LPS can enhance PKM2 activity and promote glycolysis by activating HIF-1a (Palsson-McDermott et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2019b). Therefore, it is plausible that the heightened intestinal LPS content following influenza virus infection, in conjunction with HIF-1a activation, alters host glucose metabolism, intensifying pulmonary glycolysis. MXSG, in turn, may regulate pulmonary glycolysis by reducing intestinal LPS content and inhibiting HIF-1a activity.Targeting the gut microbiota can regulate the polarization of macrophages in the lung. The disruption of the gut microbiome and the proliferation of pathogenic bacteria can result in endotoxemia, leading to impaired functionality of intestinal mucosal epithelial cells, altered intestinal permeability, and subsequent translocation of a significant amount of endotoxins LPS passing through the blood to the lung. This process induces glycolytic reprogramming of macrophages, thereby regulating the polarization of macrophage (Palsson-McDermott, et al., 2015; Vallianou et al., 2021). Macrophages, primary inflammatory effector cells in the context of influenza virus infection, exhibit polarization into distinct subtypes in response to shifts in the external microenvironment. This polarization can occur rapidly and is highly reversible (Wang et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). A fundamental event in the regulation of macrophage polarization is the metabolic reprogramming of glucose metabolism, which manifests as glycolysis-driven pro-inflammatory properties and oxidative phosphorylation-associated anti-inflammatory processes (O'Neill, 2015; Dayton et al., 2016). Our study results indicate that influenza virus infection propels the polarization of macrophages towards the M1 subtype, resulting in the upregulation of CD80 expression and heightened levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-a, IL-6, and IL-1β. Conversely, it suppresses the polarization of macrophages towards the M2 subtype, leading to the downregulation of CD206 expression and a reduction in the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Treatment with MXSG can modulate macrophage polarization, thereby ameliorating the inflammatory response in lung tissue during influenza virus infection. These findings suggest that MXSG may exert its effects by regulating macrophage polarization, ultimately mitigating the inflammatory response in lung tissue following influenza virus infection.5 ConclusionNumerous respiratory infections coincide with an imbalance in the intestinal microbiota. Microbiome-sourced bacterial signatures and metabolites can be transmitted to the lung and could regulate pulmonary immune response (Liu et al., 2021). Treatments that target the gut microbiota can potentially prevent and treat respiratory diseases. MXSG can alleviate glycolysis in lung tissue, suppress M1-type macrophage activation, promote M2-type macrophage activation, and mitigate inflammation in lung tissue. This therapeutic effect appears to be mediated by modulating gut microbiota and reducing endogenous LPS production in the intestines (Figure 6); however, the optimal dosage and active metabolites of MXSG require further investigation. Additionally, incorporating clinical samples for further analysis will yield additional data to elucidate the mechanisms of MXSG in the treatment of influenza virus pneumonia for clinical applications.Figure 6 Figure 6.

Looking forward, the market is expected to reach USD 42.5 Million by 2034, exhibiting a growth rate (CAGR) of 19% during 2024-2034.The market is driven by innovative vaccine developments and improved antiviral therapies. Additionally, there is a growing emphasis on universal flu vaccines aiming to provide broader and longer-lasting protection.Adoption of Quadrivalent Vaccines: Driving the Influenza B MarketThe introduction of quadrivalent vaccines is a watershed moment in the influenza B market, dramatically increasing the efficacy of flu prevention efforts. Unlike typical trivalent vaccines, which protect against three influenza strains (two A strains and one B strain), quadrivalent vaccines also protect against an additional B strain. This larger coverage is critical because Influenza B viruses circulate alongside Influenza A viruses each year, and their incidence varies seasonally. Quadrivalent vaccines, which include both B strains (Victoria and Yamagata lineages), provide more comprehensive protection, lowering the chance of mismatched strains and enhancing overall vaccine effectiveness. Request a PDF Sample Report: https://www.imarcgroup.com/influenza-b-marketequestsampleOne notable instance of this trend is the widespread adoption of quadrivalent vaccines by public health organizations and healthcare providers. For example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States recommends the use of quadrivalent vaccines for all eligible individuals aged six months and older. Companies like Sanofi Pasteur, with their Fluzone Quadrivalent, and GlaxoSmithKline, with their Fluarix Quadrivalent, have led the market with these enhanced vaccines. Additionally, the introduction of cell-based and recombinant quadrivalent vaccines, such as Seqirus’ Flucelvax Quadrivalent and Sanofi’s Flublok Quadrivalent, represents a significant advancement. These newer vaccines avoid the limitations associated with egg-based production, such as egg allergy risks and longer production times, offering potentially higher effectiveness and faster scalability in response to flu outbreaks. The shift towards quadrivalent vaccines is also supported by increasing public health awareness and educational campaigns emphasizing the importance of broad-spectrum flu protection. As a result, vaccination coverage rates have improved, contributing to better management of influenza seasons and reducing the incidence of flu-related complications and hospitalizations. The ongoing focus on research and development by pharmaceutical companies and the support from public health agencies underscore the commitment to enhancing influenza prevention strategies, ultimately aiming to mitigate the impact of influenza B and other strains on public health.Advancements in Vaccine Technologies: Contributing to Market ExpansionInfluenza B is a contagious respiratory illness due to the Influenza B virus, which primarily affects humans and is responsible for significant seasonal outbreaks worldwide. Unlike Influenza A, which can infect a wide range of species and lead to pandemics, Influenza B is typically limited to humans, reducing its pandemic potential. The virus has two main lineages, B/Yamagata and B/Victoria, and vaccines are formulated to provide protection against both. These vaccines are crucial in preventing severe illness, hospitalizations, and deaths associated with Influenza B. They work by stimulating the body’s immune system to produce antibodies against the virus, thereby reducing the risk of infection and mitigating the acuteness of symptoms in those who do contract the virus. Influenza B vaccines are particularly important for vulnerable populations, including the elderly, young children, and individuals with chronic health conditions.Advancements in vaccine technologies have significantly enhanced the effectiveness and accessibility of Influenza B vaccines. A notable development is the introduction of cell-based and recombinant vaccine production methods. Traditional flu vaccines are produced using chicken eggs, a process that can be slow and less efficient. Cell-based vaccines, such as Flucelvax, use cultured mammalian cells, which allow for faster and more flexible production, particularly in the face of sudden outbreaks. Recombinant vaccines, like Flublok, utilize genetic engineering to produce the hemagglutinin protein, a key component of the virus, in insect cells, bypassing the need for eggs entirely. These modern techniques not only expedite vaccine production but also offer an option for those with egg allergies. Additionally, the development of quadrivalent vaccines, which protect against four different flu virus strains, including both lineages of Influenza B, represents a significant advancement over trivalent vaccines that cover only three strains. The continuous evolution of these technologies underscores a robust and adaptive approach to combating Influenza B, ensuring broader protection and improved public health outcomes.Development of Universal Flu Vaccines:Influenza B is a significant contributor to seasonal flu epidemics, causing a substantial burden on public health systems globally. Unlike Influenza A, which is known for its ability to cause pandemics due to its broad host range and higher mutation rates, Influenza B primarily affects humans and tends to cause less severe outbreaks. However, it still poses a serious threat, particularly to vulnerable populations such as children, the elderly, and those with underlying health conditions. The current vaccination strategy involves annually updated vaccines that target the predicted strains of the virus. Despite these efforts, the virus’s ability to mutate frequently results in mismatches between vaccine strains and circulating strains, reducing vaccine effectiveness. Consequently, there is a growing need for more reliable and long-lasting solutions to combat Influenza B.The development of universal flu vaccines aims to address this challenge by providing broad and long-lasting protection against multiple influenza strains, including both Influenza A and B. One promising approach involves targeting the conserved regions of the virus that remain relatively balanced across different strains. For instance, researchers are focusing on the hemagglutinin (HA) stalk region, which is less variable than the head region targeted by traditional vaccines. Studies have shown that vaccines targeting the HA stalk can induce broadly protective immune responses. Another innovative strategy is the use of nanoparticle-based vaccines, such as those developed by the University of Washington’s Institute for Protein Design, which presents multiple viral antigens in a highly immunogenic format. Clinical trials for these universal vaccines are underway, with some showing promising results in early-phase trials. The successful introduction of a universal flu vaccine would represent a paradigm shift in influenza prevention, potentially eliminating the need for annual vaccine updates and providing consistent protection against both seasonal and pandemic influenza strains. This advancement could significantly reduce the global burden of influenza, improving health outcomes and reducing healthcare costs associated with flu-related illnesses.Buy Full Report: https://www.imarcgroup.com/checkout?id=8714&method=587Leading Companies in the Influenza B Market:The market research report by IMARC encompasses a comprehensive analysis of the competitive landscape in the market.

Facebook Linkedin Threads Whatsapp Reddit Email Page link The world is currently seeing the fastest-spreading, largest-ever outbreak of H5N1, a highly contagious, deadly strain of avian influenza. Scientists say this virus now presents an existential threat to the world’s biodiversity, with the risk to humans rising as it continues to leap the species barrier, reaching new host species.H5N1 has already impacted at least 485 bird species and 48 mammal species, killing seals, sea otters, dolphins, foxes, California condors, albatrosses, bald eagles, cougars, polar bears and a zoo tiger. Since it broke out in Europe in 2020, this virus has spread globally. Carried by birds along migratory pathways, it has invaded six continents, including Antarctica.This current H5N1 animal pandemic (or panzootic) was caused by humans: A mild form of avian flu carried by wild birds turned deadly when it infected domestic poultry. Many industrial-scale poultry farms adjoin wetlands where migrating birds congregate, facilitating rapid spread.The toll on some bird and mammal populations has been devastating. With continued outbreaks, some imperiled species could be pushed to the brink, with wildlife already fighting to survive against a changing climate, disappearing habitat and other stressors.See All Key Ideas Brown skuas and south polar skuas, two gull-like species that nest in Antarctica, are sometimes called the “pirates of the Southern seas.” These migratory seabirds are fierce, competitive predators that hunt or scavenge anything, from eggs and adult birds to seafood, mammals or garbage. “They’re really tough animals — and they’re dying,” says Antonio Quesada, director of the Spanish Polar Committee. He gravely recounts why this season’s field work in the Antarctic was like no other: A lethal strain of avian flu, H5N1, breached this fragile ecosystem in February. Only a handful of specially trained researchers were allowed onshore in outbreak sites, garbed in hazmat suits to prevent contagion and spread. The true scale of the event is still unknown, but reports were grim. In the Falkland Islands, H5N1 killed 10,000 black-browed albatross and ravaged a gentoo penguin colony. Scientists discovered a mass skua die-off: 50 carcasses littered a Beak Island nesting colony of 130. Quesada has rarely seen a single dead skua in 20 years’ work in Antarctica. “They’re an indicator species. If they’re dying, what does it mean for other birds?” he asks. The threat posed by H5N1 extends far beyond the frozen South. Few people realize that the world is currently gripped in another serious pandemic — or, to be exact, a panzootic, the animal equivalent. This virus has now infected more than 500 bird and mammal species.

The world’s animals in trouble Since it emerged in 2020 in Europe, this “Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI)” strain has blazed a trail of death across the planet, the largest outbreak in history. The virus is both lethal and unusually transmissible, jumping between birds, mammals and livestock with frightening agility. Experts say the threat to humans is rising. Many countries are increasing surveillance and developing or buying vaccines. Cases are ticking up in the U.S.: Four people contracted the virus from cows and 10 others caught it from chickens. Meanwhile, it continues to devastate wildlife, including many endangered animals, says Chris Walzer, executive director of health at the nonprofit Wildlife Conservation Society. As of March, H5N1 had leapt the species barrier to infect some 485 types of bird and at least 48 mammal species, according to United Nations estimates. Many of these species had never been diagnosed with avian influenza before. The disease has infiltrated even the most remote regions on six continents. When a polar bear in Alaska succumbed in 2023, it marked the first detected mammal death from avian flu in the Arctic. Thus far, only Australia and the Pacific Islands have been spared. And the virus is still on the move, spreading to new hosts as it evolves and picks up genes from other bird flu strains. Victims have died in staggering numbers, especially animals that congregate in large groups like pinnipeds. The virus swept along South America’s Atlantic and Pacific coastlines, slaying more than 30,000 sea lions in 2022-23. It then killed some 17,000 Southern elephant seal pups on Argentina’s Península Valdés — the species’ largest die-off ever. H5N1 has been carried worldwide by migrating birds. But new research shows that this current strain (dubbed clade 2.3.4.4b) can now spread directly between mammals, with frightening implications. It seems that “H5N1 viruses are becoming more evolutionarily flexible and adapting to mammals in new ways,” the study’s authors write, which “could have global consequences for wildlife, humans, and/or livestock.” Walzer warns, “H5N1 now presents an existential threat to the world’s biodiversity.” Worldwide, seabirds have been particularly hard hit by this avian flu panzootic, including terns (Sterna hirundinacea) pictured here that died at Punta Leon in Argentina.

A human-caused problem It’s important to understand that this panzootic “is a man-made problem,” says Vincent Munster, who heads the Virus Ecology Section at the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Avian flu is not uncommon in wild birds, particularly in its natural hosts: ducks, geese, gulls, terns, swans and other waterfowl. They carry a low pathogenic form, a mild virus that may be asymptomatic. It spreads seasonally, when multiple species congregate at migration stopover sites or cluster together to nest. But when avian flu spills over into poultry, it can morph into a highly contagious, fatal virus. The current panzootic began when this H5N1 strain jumped from domestic poultry back into wild birds — which happened because of modern livestock production methods. Humans further facilitated spillover by destroying wetlands, which crowds migrating birds into small scraps of habitat, often with poultry farms nearby. When farms encroach wetlands, it creates the perfect interface for this type of virus, Walzer says. It’s a veritable petri dish of opportunity for avian flu to swap genes and mutate into potentially more virulent or transmissible strains. This environment allowed the virus to infect chickens, geese and ducks –– and jump back into the wild in a virulent form. “The emergence of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza is a direct result of commercial, large-scale poultry farming,” Munster says. There are more than 34 billion chickens on Earth, according to Food and Agriculture Organization estimates. The U.S. Delmarva Peninsula offers a prime example of farm-wetland overlap. It’s both a migratory stopover and a wintering ground along the North American flyway on the nation’s Mid-Atlantic coast. It’s also the site of a $4.4 billion poultry industry that raised 600 million chickens in 2023. H5N1 has hit there — and across the globe. In Cambodia, for example, farmers that raise their ducks and geese in wetlands have also seen outbreaks. The virus is now spreading among cows, infecting at least 171 herds in 13 U.S. states. It thrives in udder cells, and RNA from H5N1 has been found in milk. Another serious concern: H5N1 has not petered out between spring and fall migrations, like avian flu normally does. It’s now endemic in Europe and North America. When that happened, Walzer says, “people began worrying that it’s not going to go away anymore.” It has flared for four years straight now, with wild birds currently carriers, reservoir hosts and victims of the virus. Highly pathogenic avian influenza killed thousands of black-browed albatross (Thalassarche melanophris) chicks in the Falkland Islands and Islas Malvinas, where two-thirds of the entire population lives.

In 1996, a goose in China’s Guangdong province may have been “patient zero” for the current strain, which spread among the flock and passed to wild birds. The virus then morphed into a severe respiratory disease that infected 18 people and killed six in Hong Kong. That outbreak ended after 1.5 million chickens were slaughtered. Next came a “viral chatter” phase. Viruses don’t just break through species barriers. As they change, they make periodic forays into other species, sometimes over years. In most cases, these ventures are unsuccessful. Unless a virus can enter cells and replicate, it circulates harmlessly. Flu viruses mutate rapidly as they acquire genes from other viruses: mixing, matching, reassorting and adapting, says Colin Ross Parrish, a virologist at Cornell University’s College of Veterinary Medicine. Each genetic mutation creates a new building block for evolution: Genetic sequences are cellular instructions. They help a virus evade immunity in a host, determine how it causes infection, how it spreads and much more. Avian influenza’s eight-section genome offers numerous opportunities to reassort its genetics, not unlike a Las Vegas slot machine –– and in 2003, it hit a viral jackpot. Avian flu mutated to successfully spill back from poultry into wild birds, launching the current panzootic. Fast forward to 2020 when H5N1 appeared in its current form in European birds and then successfully infiltrated new species, including mammals. It quickly spread to Africa and the Middle East, as it was carried long distances along migratory flyways. Humans helped by selling and shipping infected poultry across national borders. The virus crossed the Atlantic, reaching U.S. and Canadian shores in late 2021. Soon, mallards and swans were dying in the U.S. Midwest, bald eagles died nationwide, seals perished in Maine, as did bobcats in Wisconsin and raccoons in Washington and Michigan, to name just a few of the many losses. The virus then aggressively invaded South America, targeting birds and sea mammals. Genetic studies on dead seabirds, a dolphin and a sea lion in Peru shed light on H5N1’s movement and adaptations. Researchers discovered that in the U.S., the Eurasian strain added genes; in this form, it expanded its repertoire of hosts and raged like wildfire through large seal and sea lion colonies. H5N1 finally reached both poles. Outbreaks continue to arise nearly everywhere.

Sharing a home or gathering in large groups poses a huge H5N1 risk, says Amandine Gamble, an infectious disease ecology expert at Cornell University’s College of Veterinary Medicine. To understand where birds go and how they spread H5N1, she is collecting genetic material from various species in the Falkland Islands and outfitting them with tracking devices to follow their movements. Regardless of the location, the virus triggers a systemic infection in birds. They may become lethargic, sneezing, coughing, gasping for air or experiencing intestinal issues. The virus also invades the brain. Sick birds may become disoriented, uncoordinated, stumbling, swimming or walking in circles, trembling or jerking their necks before keeling over dead. Some suddenly die without showing any sign of illness. Survivors may pass the virus to others. Mammals experience many of the same symptoms as birds, but postmortems have also revealed pneumonia and bleeding in the heart, liver and other organs. Autopsies of 55 mammals showed that the most commonly afflicted part of the brain was the frontal lobe, which explains the movement and cognitive symptoms. The genie is out of the bottle, says Waltzer. He emphasizes that the length of the outbreak, as well as the amount of the virus in the environment, is unprecedented. “The sheer global distribution of this virus,” he notes, “is underestimated everywhere — as well as the breadth of ecosystems that are being impacted.” Researchers are deeply concerned by the effects of this red-alert virus: “High pathogenicity H5N1 is a real, tangible threat to wildlife, of a magnitude and scale never seen before,” says Marcela Uhart, who heads the Latin American program at the University of California Davis’ One Health Institute. On a United Nations situation update map, swaths of the world seem untouched, but that is likely because some regions have little or no monitoring for avian influenza, Walzer notes. For example, experts suspect there is vast underreporting in Africa. Many countries have slim resources, so pathogen hunters target the deadliest human threats: malaria.

Image by Sharon Guynup. Incomprehensible carnage Many pathogens, including avian influenza, are zoonotic: They jump between wildlife, livestock and humans. In recent decades, zoonotic diseases have emerged and spread at accelerating rates. They are frequently fatal and have no cure. As humanity encroaches on wild areas, people, livestock and wildlife come into into unnatural proximity, exposing all to germs they have no immunity to — like avian influenza –– and leave wild animals with ever-shrinking habitat. Add poaching for the illegal wildlife trade, bushmeat hunting, and rapidly changing climate, and it’s no surprise that many species are in serious danger of extinction. H5N1 is the newest threat. “The number of different species being infected is quite profound,” says Emily Denstedt, a health program adviser with the Wildlife Conservation Society. Wild birds are among the most affected animals. This is a major change: previous H5N1 strains primarily attacked poultry. At least 485 bird species from 25 classifications have been infected, including puffins, pelicans peregrine falcons, owls, toucans, parrots, bald eagles, warblers, finches and many others. However, seabirds are by far the hardest hit. H5N1 “super-spreader” events in the U.K. offer sobering examples of the carnage wrought by this virus, though there’s no way to accurately count the casualties. Nesting colonies are now notably emptier in many locations. In Scotland — home to 60% of the world’s great skuas — breeding numbers have plummeted by three-quarters since 2021. Some 16,000 gannets died and the population in Wales dipped to precarious lows not seen since the 1960s. Rangers discovered more than 660 dead Arctic tern chicks in England.

During the spring of 2022 in Africa, thousands of birds perished, particularly along the East Atlantic Flyway migration route in Senegal and The Gambia.Later that year, South Africa lost at least 28 African penguins –– a tragedy for these endangered birds. In the U.S., the virus struck Lake Michigan’s Caspian terns, killing 62%. In early 2023, pelicans littered Peruvian beaches; more than 40% of the population died. At least 20 critically endangered California condors perished in Arizona, endangering their perilous recovery from just 22 birds in 1987. So far, seals and sea lions are the only mammals dying en masse. However, the sheer number of affected mammals is worrying, ranging from grizzly bears, lions, pika, cougars, cows and dolphins to domestic dogs and cats, racoons, foxes, sea otters and a zoo tiger. Six dead walruses were discovered in Svalbard in 2023, some 965 kilometers (600 miles) from the Arctic Circle. Uhart explains the broader collateral damage: All species play a role in maintaining healthy ecosystems, and big losses reverberate throughout the entire community. She offers pinnipeds as an example. As top predators, seals, sea lions and walruses keep prey species in check. Without them, previously constrained species multiply, may expand their ranges and displace other animals. “We almost wiped out pinnipeds in the past, hunting them for their fur and their blubber, and they are only now recovering after years of protection,” Uhart says. “We can’t let a disease put them at risk again.” There may be other, less obvious effects on wildlife. Birds that sicken and survive probably won’t fledge young, Munster says, and birds that breed in large colonies may not thrive in smaller groups. Walzer notes that we humans and our monitoring systems are really bad at detecting these more subtle decreases in populations, “And suddenly, they’re gone.” Healthy elephant seal (Mirounga leonina).

A clouded, potentially deadly future The ultimate extent of this global animal apocalypse will hinge on H5N1’s vigor, endurance and adaptability — and importantly, on precisely how it adapts. Much depends on the ways species interact. “Lifestyle impacts the dynamics of how [H5N1] spreads in animal populations,” says Cornell’s Gamble. In close quarters, it passes between birds, but not all develop terrible disease. They may become “silent spreaders.” Another important factor is how animals are exposed — and where. H5N1 is a resilient organism: It replicates in the respiratory tracts of mammals and birds — and in birds’ intestines. Animals can shed virus from infected cells after only six hours. It’s quite hardy and remains infectious in water. One study found that H5N1survived in bird feces for nearly a day in extreme heat (42° Celsius, 107° Fahrenheit), five days in balmy temperatures (24°C, 75°F) and for up to two months in the cold (4°C, 39°F). This strain’s resilience is still unknown. Carnivores and scavengers can catch the virus by eating an infected bird carcass. But researchers have also confirmed that mammals now transmit the virus between themselves, in the wild, on farms and in zoos. It spread on a mink fur farm in Spain (where tens of thousands lived in about 30 barns), among dairy cows in the U.S., tigers in a Chinese zoo and pinnipeds in Argentina. Scientists determined that the strain that killed elephant seals also infected terns –– which could spread it far and wide. Quesada is deeply concerned about the coming breeding season in the Antarctic. Confirmation of the virus in elephant seals “puts us on even higher alert,” he says. Risk to humans grows as the virus racks up an ever-longer list of mammal hosts. Fourteen people have been diagnosed this year in the U.S.; all worked with cattle or chickens. So far, there’s no evidence that the virus can pass directly between humans. However, the World Health Organization (WHO) has cautioned public health officials to get ready for a potential spillover. Alert levels will jump if H5N1 becomes airborne, if it can be sneezed out and carried via aerosols or respiratory droplets, Uhart says. A key question remains: As individuals develop immunity, will the virus fizzle out? And if so, when? Predictions for wildlife aren’t good. In places where H5N1 has already invaded, Uhart says, “it will take years, maybe decades or more, for some wild species to recover.” In those locations, she says she believes “it will likely remain, continue to adapt … and evolve into new strains.” She expects recurring deadly waves and “for some species that are currently endangered, just one outbreak may mean extinction.” Munster likens this panzootic to the SARS pandemic — but in wildlife, “with no preemptive, therapeutic or prophylactic countermeasures, like social distancing, masking, vaccines and antivirals.” One strategy, vaccinating poultry against avian flu, could stop or limit the current H5N1 evolutionary pool, Walzer says. In 2023, the first walruses died of the virus in the Arctic, which is worrying because these mammals congregate in groups. Image © Steve Winter. For decades, experts have been waving a red flag, trying to gain traction for a “One Health” strategy to prevent future pandemics. It’s a holistic approach, inclusive of human, wildlife, livestock and ecosystem health. Importantly, it incorporates disease risk into decision-making. A One Health approach shifts the onus on officials to prevent diseases before they jump between species, rather than the current model — reacting once a crisis hits. Studies show this to be the most effective and economical pandemic strategy. In December 2021, amid COVID’s mass human mortalities, the WHO and representatives from 194 nations agreed to negotiate a pandemic treaty. But countries have not yet reached an agreement, missing a May deadline to deliver the document at the 77th World Health Assembly. A recent editorial stated that negotiators are “nowhere close to adopting text that will truly prevent consequential pathogen spillovers from wildlife.” With massive industrial livestock operations located within migratory flyways, “We could have seen [this panzootic] coming, but our ability to actually intervene on a legislative and political level is not there unfortunately,” Munster says. “And… [wildlife] is definitely paying the price.” Meanwhile, viral chatter continues to surge, invisible and unabated between domestic and wild species.

Opens in a new tab or window email article Administering the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) prefusion F protein vaccine (Arexvy) at the same time as the adjuvanted seasonal quadrivalent influenza vaccine stimulated an adequate immune response and was safe in older adults, a phase III randomized trial showed. Among adults ages 65 and older, co-administration of the RSV and influenza vaccines resulted in hemagglutination inhibition titers that were noninferior to those with sequential administration for three out of four influenza strains, as well as noninferior neutralization titers for the RSV-A and RSV-B subtypes, at 1 month after vaccination, reported Shady Kotb, PhD, of GSK in Wavre, Belgium, and colleagues in Clinical Infectious Diseases. These vaccines can be co-administered in older adults "without clinically relevant interference with the immune responses to either vaccine and with a clinically acceptable safety and reactogenicity profile," the authors wrote. "Given the seasonal overlap of these 2 infections, the ability to give both vaccines during a single doctor's visit may improve convenience and increase uptake of both vaccines, ultimately reducing the high burden of both influenza and RSV disease among older adults." Titers were considered noninferior if the upper limit of the two-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the adjusted geometric mean titer (GMT) ratios was ≤1.50. Immunogenicity with co-administration was noninferior for influenza strains A/Victoria(H1N1), B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata. However, noninferiority criteria were "marginally missed" for the A/Darwin(H3N2) influenza strain (95% CI upper limit 1.53), Kotb and team noted. The low hemagglutination titers for H3N2 may have been due to rapid mutation of that strain, which might blunt the immune response, the authors said. Alternatively, the hemagglutination assay may have not accurately detected a response. In a post-hoc analysis using a different type of assay (microneutralization), the researchers did observe higher titers for H3N2 than those observed with the hemagglutination inhibition assay at 1 month post-vaccination. Based on the microneutralization assay, responses for H3N2 were similar in the co-administration and sequential administration groups, "supporting an adequate immune response to the A/Darwin(H3N2) vaccine strain after co-administration," Kotb and colleagues wrote. With the microneutralization assay, the post-vaccination adjusted GMT ratio was 1.23 (95% CI 1.06-1.42), meeting the noninferiority criteria. Seroconversion rates for hemagglutinin antibodies 1 month after co-administration for each influenza vaccine strain also met noninferiority criteria for all influenza strains -- but, again, with the exception of H3N2, "suggesting that the signal of possible interference may be real," wrote Angela Branche, MD, of the University of Rochester in New York, in an accompanying editorial. "The authors suggest this may not be clinically meaningful, but further study is needed," she noted. The CDC has indicated that co-administration of flu and RSV vaccines, as well as COVID-19 vaccines, is safe. Noting that uptake of the recently approved RSV vaccines in older adults has been slow in its first season, Branche pointed to low awareness of RSV as a serious illness, vaccine fatigue, and suboptimal vaccine access. "However, equally as likely is uncertainty around the safety and effectiveness of RSV vaccines and what groups might most benefit from its use," she wrote. "When coupled with the increasingly crowded field of older adults' vaccinations that include shingles, pneumococcal, influenza, COVID-19, and RSV vaccines, it's not hard to understand why many outside the RSV scientific community have outstanding questions on how to use these vaccines," she added. Giving the two shots at the same time appeared to be safe overall, with most solicited adverse events being grade 1 or grade 2. Pain at vaccine sites was the most common adverse event in both groups. However, systemic adverse events -- fatigue and myalgia -- were more common in the co-administration group, affecting about 46% and 39% of participants, respectively. The most frequently reported grade 3 adverse event was erythema at the injection site for the RSV vaccine, occurring in 1.9% of participants in the co-administration group and 1.3% of those in the sequential group. One serious adverse event -- giant cell arteritis -- occurred in the sequential group and was considered vaccine-related. It began 10 days after receipt of the influenza vaccine, but the participant had not received the RSV vaccine. There were six fatal serious adverse events, all in the sequential group, but none were considered to be vaccine related. This open-label trial involved 37 centers in Belgium, Finland, France, Spain, and the U.K. Of a total of 1,045 participants, 523 were randomized to the co-administration arm (mean age 72.1, 51.2% women, 99.8% white) and 522 to the sequential administration arm (mean age 72.2, 52.7% men, 98.9% white). In the sequential arm, participants received influenza and RSV vaccines 1 month apart. Vaccines were injected in the deltoid muscle, and in opposite arms when co-administered. Of note, the trial used only GSK's RSV vaccine and Seqirus' influenza vaccine. Kotb and team acknowledged that the open-label study design could have led to detection bias for reactogenicity/safety. In addition, the trial excluded people with immunocompromising conditions who are at high risk for severe RSV and influenza.

NIAID The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a new risk assessment of the H5N1 bird flu virus circulating in dairy cows on Friday, increasing slightly its estimate of the chance it poses of triggering a pandemic. The new assessment, developed using the CDC’s influenza risk assessment tool or IRAT, gauged the risk the virus might someday cause a pandemic at 5.79, up from a previous score of 5.12 from an assessment of a related virus conducted in April 2023. Both numbers are within what the CDC tool terms a “moderate” risk of 4.0 to 7.9. Some swine influenza viruses and the H7N9 bird flu virus have scored higher than this version of H5N1 using the IRAT process.advertisement The CDC’s explanation of the new assessment noted that the uncertainty around the scores for the various elements that were assessed — things like the severity of disease caused by the viruses and the degree to which humans have any immune protection to them — overlap, making the difference between them minimal. Vivien Dugan, director of the CDC’s influenza division, cautioned that the IRAT is a tool for government planning purposes, and isn’t meant to gauge the risk for the public. The agency still characterizes the risk H5N1 poses to the general public as low.

Privacy Policy “The tool was really developed to find a standardized, systematic, statistical way with subject matter experts to kind of quantify what we think about the future of where a particular virus may go,” she told STAT in an interview. The information is used to inform government decision-making about pandemic preparedness priorities.advertisement “The tool … tries to get an answer to two questions. What’s the risk or the chance that any particular virus that’s not circulating broadly in people will become a sustained human-to-human transmitting virus? That’s the emergence score. And then if that virus emerges … what would be the impact on public health?” she said. The specific virus analyzed in the new assessment was taken from the first human H5N1 case in the U.S. this year, a farmworker in Texas whose infection was reported at the beginning of April. The most recent previous H5N1 risk assessment was based on analysis of a virus retrieved from an outbreak of H5N1 in mink in Spain in 2023. Both viruses belong to the subset or clade of H5N1 viruses known as 2.3.4.4b. The new assessment lowered fractionally the estimate of what the public health impact of a pandemic caused by this virus would be. The calculations were run based on data to June 26, before a spate of human cases were detected among workers in Colorado who were culling chickens on two large H5N1-infected poultry operations. As of now, there have been 13 confirmed cases in the U.S., all involving mild infections. Ten of those cases have been detected in Colorado. Related: CDC will offer seasonal flu shots to farmworkers to lower bird flu risk “This updated assessment indicates that this [Texas virus] has scored slightly lower in some risk elements and slightly higher in others compared with the previously assessed H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b viruses,” the new IRAT report said. The CDC has been analyzing the pandemic potential of non-human flu viruses using this tool for about a decade. To date none of the analyses have led to an assessment that a particular virus constituted a high risk of a pandemic. Recently the United Kingdom’s Health Security Agency increased its assessment of the pandemic risk of the specific H5N1 virus circulating in cows to four from three on its six-point scale, in light of “at least 5 months of sustained transmission in cattle in the US with additional mammalian species affected and onwards transmission to poultry.” Translating the IRAT numbers into information that is meaningful to individuals is challenging. To date none of the viruses analyzed using it have gone on to trigger a pandemic. Related: Could cow vaccines help halt the spread of bird flu in U.S. herds? Experts are divided Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Diseases Research and Policy, said the current situation with ongoing transmission of H5N1 in dairy herds is “an enigma” to influenza researchers, given the fact that the virus is infecting a very wide array of animals, causing severe illness in many, but few human cases of late. And the human cases that have occurred in recent years with this clade of H5N1 have been mainly mild. “I think the IRAT is trying to put a numeric [value] to something that none of us can get our arms around,” Osterholm said. He noted that despite the ongoing spread in cows, the virus hasn’t yet appeared to have gained the capacity to better attach to the type of receptors that are found on cells in the upper airways of people. If the virus acquired that ability, it is believed it would be able to more easily spread to and among humans. “To try to make sense of all of this I think is really difficult. We’ve seen no evidence of increased [human] receptor site binding. And so I think it remains at best confusing,” Osterholm said.

The scientists, led by Robin Avanthay, PhD, and Gert Zimmer, PhD, suggested that with further testing the novel two-step approach could hold promise as a next-generation strategy for fighting flu more effectively. The vaccine strategy, they commented, may be easily adapted to emerging influenza A virus (IAV) subtypes, with potential to help control future IAV pandemics. The IVI scientists, working in collaboration with researchers at the University of Bern, and the University of Murcia, described the study and findings in PLOS Pathogens, in a paper titled “Evaluation of a novel intramuscular prime/intranasal boost vaccination strategy against influenza in the pig model.” In their report the team concluded “… our innovative vaccination regimen represents a promising strategy to control influenza disease and virus spread in both humans and livestock.” Influenza A virus causes acute respiratory infections that in humans are usually associated with sudden high fever, muscle pain, headache, coughing, and fatigue lasting up to a week or more, the authors wrote. For some individuals the infection can be severe, or even life-threatening, particularly if the virus spreads to the lower respiratory tract, which can lead to viral pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Individuals most at risk include the very young, the elderly, and those with underlying diseases. Seasonal flu vaccines typically consist of inactivated components of flu virus injected into muscle, helping the body’s immune system to recognize and fight the disease. “The most commonly used human influenza vaccines to control seasonal epidemics are inactivated influenza vaccines standardized for hemagglutinin (HA) content,” the authors explained. Such vaccines trigger production of serum antibodies, but this approach has limited ability to prevent infection where it initially occurs in the upper respiratory tract, the team pointed out. “A small proportion of these virus-specific serum IgG is secreted into the lower respiratory tract where they protect against severe influenza pneumonia and ARDS … However, secretion of serum IgG into the mucosal tissues of the upper respiratory tract is not efficient.” Such vaccines might also foster evolution of versions of flu capable of evading immune attack. An effective alternative is a live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) which uses a modified flu virus that has been weakened so it cannot cause disease. Live-attenuated influenza vaccines can be administered through the nose directly into the upper respiratory tract, prompting a multi-pronged immune response against infection. “Live-attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIV) offer several advantages over inactivated influenza vaccines because they are administered via the natural route of infection and induce a local immune response directed against multiple viral antigens,” the investigators added. For their newly reported study the team evaluated their novel live-attenuated vaccine candidate, NS1(1–126)-ΔPAX, in pigs, demonstrating that the vaccine induced a strong local immune response that protected animals against flu virus. However, although the vaccine did not cause any symptoms in pigs, it was shed from the upper respiratory tract for a prolonged time. If such a vaccine were used in humans, there is a chance that it could be transmitted to someone with a compromised immune system, potentially causing health problems. Intramuscular prime/intranasal boost vaccination protocol reduces LAIV shedding. (A) Schematic representation of the experimental design.

(B) Pigs were first immunized (i.m.) with the VSV-Luc control vaccine followed by intranasal immunisation with NS1(1–126)-ΔPAX LAIV.

(E) AUC analyses of viral RNA load in nasal swab samples collected between days 0 and 17 after intranasal vaccination with LAIV (calculated with data from B-D). Significant differences of the AUC values were determined with the one-way ANOVA test (*p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001, ****p<0.0001). Fig 2A was created with Biorender.com. [Avanthay et al, 2024, PLOS Pathogens, CC-BY 4.0 ]Aiming to strike a balance between advantages and risks, Avanthay and colleagues developed a two-step immunization strategy. “To improve the performance of LAIV in terms of immunogenicity and reduced virus shedding, we developed a novel prime/boost immunization protocol,” the team stated. Prior to nasal administration of the live-attenuated flu vaccine candidate, NS1(1-126)-ΔPAX, the animals were primed using a vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) as a vaccine delivery mechanism. VSV represents a promising vector approach across vaccine research. However, in contrast to commonly used VSV-vectored vaccines, the vaccine used in this study was “propagation-defective”—engineered to perform only a single round of infection for safety. “To improve LAIV safety, we developed a novel prime/boost vaccination strategy combining primary intramuscular immunization with a haemagglutinin-encoding propagation-defective vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) replicon, followed by a secondary immunization with the NS1(1–126)-ΔPAX LAIV via the nasal route,” the researchers wrote. “The selection of the VSV vector was based on our previous work demonstrating an efficient induction of antibody and T cell responses to the HA antigen that mediated partial protection of pigs against heterologous IAV challenge.” When tested in pigs this two-step vaccination strategy resulted in a strong immune response, both body-wide and specifically in the upper respiratory tract where initial flu infection occurs. No infection was detected in the two-step-vaccinated pigs after they were exposed to virulent flu virus. The intranasally administered live vaccine boosted the systemic flu-specific antibody response and resulted in higher frequencies of flu-specific T helper memory cells, which was the case if the live vaccine was used without prior priming. The collective results, the investigators stated, “… demonstrate that our novel intramuscular prime/intranasal boost vaccination protocol induces enhanced systemic IAV-specific immunity in terms of higher IgG, higher neutralizing antibodies titers and enhanced memory Th1 cells. These systemic responses combined with the induction of local mucosal immunity in the respiratory tract provided sterilizing immunity against homologous virus infection.” Importantly, when compared with pigs that only received NS1(1-126)-ΔPAX on its own, the two-step-vaccinated pigs showed significantly less shedding of the vaccine candidate from their upper respiratory tract. “… the combination of the intramuscular immunization with VSV-H1 and the intranasal boost using the NS1(1–126)-ΔPAX LAIV enhanced the safety by strongly reducing LAIV shedding and completely preventing shedding of challenge virus,” the scientists reported. Summarizing the team’s study and findings, Zimmer said, “A novel prime/boost vaccination strategy against influenza was evaluated in the porcine animal model. We combined the primary intramuscular immunization with a propagation-defective replicon vaccine with the secondary intranasal immunization using a genetically modified live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV), and found that this immunization regimen resulted in reduced LAIV shedding, increased production of specific serum IgG, neutralizing antibodies, Th1 memory cells, and fully protected the animals against homologous virus challenge.” This novel two-step vaccination strategy may foster the duration of protective immunity as well as protection against flu virus variants, they suggested. “It will be of high interest to analyze in future experiments whether our prime/boost vaccination regimen and the induction of a strong memory T cell response will also provide protection against antigen-drifted IAV.” The authors further concluded, “… the present novel prime/boost vaccination protocol provides a basis for the development of alternative next-generation vaccination strategies that will help to more effectively control seasonal influenza epidemics and persistent circulation of IAV in livestock. In particular, the mucosal immunity induced by this vaccine strategy may reduce the spread of IAV and help to improve the level of herd immunity. As this prime/boost vaccination strategy can be easily and timely adapted to emerging IAV subtypes, it may also be useful in the control of future IAV pandemics.” NewsInfluenza vaccineInfluenza virusIntramuscular administrationIntranasal administrationPigRespiratory diseasesT-cellsViral pneumonia Share FacebookTwitterLinkedinReddItEmail Previous articleProtein Production Pattern Can Predict Melanoma Therapy Severe Side EffectsNext articleProtein Counting Technique Improves Analysis of Microscopy Images Sophia Ktori Also of Interest Cancer-Fighting Zeal Regained by Tired T Cells Deprived of Lactic Acid Using Patient-Derived Organoids to Develop Novel Therapies for Complex and Inherited Diseases Engineered Antibodies Selectively Target Mutations on HER2, Kill Cancer in Mice Cancer Research Institute Awards Honor Contributions to T-Cell Research and Autoimmune Regulation Vertical Plant-Based Protein Expression: Lower Cost, Reduced Footprint Alternative Vaccine Innovations Beyond the Existing mRNA-Based Vaccines for COVID-19 Related Media Shehnaaz Suliman, MD, MPhil, Discusses Targeted Respiratory Therapies on "Close to the Edge" Biomarker Based Companion Diagnostics Are Enabling Precision Oncology Gallo at 80: HIV Pioneer Still in the Lab Hacking Immune Cells What Makes Dogs So Friendly?

And as if that's not enough, H5N1 is now crossing the species barrier more frequently, putting humans at greater risk.

State Fair 2 attractions pulled from Iowa State Fair due to avian influenza concerns by: Griffin Wright Posted: Aug 8, 2024 / 09:40 AM CDT Updated: Aug 8, 2024 / 09:40 AM CDT by: Griffin Wright Posted: Aug 8, 2024 / 09:40 AM CDT Updated: Aug 8, 2024 / 09:40 AM CDT SHARE DES MOINES, Iowa – The Iowa State Fair is cutting two attractions due to concerns about avian influenza infections in Dairy Cows. The fair also increased the testing requirements for dairy cows attending the fair. The Milking Parlor and the I Milked a Cow Experience will not be a part of the fair this year to prevent the spread of avian flu. So far this year there have been at least ten confirmed cases of bird flu in Iowa dairy herds. Iowa State Fair champion baker to compete on new Netflix show Dr. Jeff Kaisand, the Bureau Chief and State Veterinarian for the Iowa Department of Agriculture’s Animal Industry Division, said that the added safety measures balance keeping the exhibitions going with keeping the animals healthy. “We take very seriously the health status of all animals in Iowa. We want to make sure that exhibitions can continue, but they’re continuing in a manner where we’re doing the best we can to not spread disease when animals come together. So we’re looking at also protecting the herd of the state of herd flock of the state of Iowa,” Kaisand said. Ford Domeyer, a cattle showman at the Iowa State Fair, said the precautions are important. “Showing cows is like a really big part of what we do so any precautions we have to take in order to continue to have the cows and have that quality of a show is definitely a necessary thing for people in the industry,” Domeyer said. To find a full list of cattle shows visit the Iowa State Fair website.

A new study by a broad team of researchers at Iowa State University’s College of Veterinary Medicine helps explain why.Sialic acid, a sugar molecule found on the surface of some animal cells, acts as a receptor for influenza. Without sialic acid providing an entry point to attach, invade and infect, a flu virus is unlikely to find a potential host hospitable.Before the recent HPAI outbreak in dairy herds, there was scant research into sialic acid levels in the mammary glands of cattle. Scientists had no reason to suspect the milk-producing organs would be a good target for influenza.“In livestock, we hadn’t usually looked in milk for viruses. Bacteria, sure. But not so much viruses,” said Eric Burrough, professor of veterinary diagnostic and production animal medicine.A team of Iowa State researchers who examined mammary gland samples from two infected cows found a rich supply of sialic acid, which could shed light on how the virus attaches to hosts and help develop measures to slow the illness’ spread.“We need to stop transmission, and one way to potentially do that is through milking machines. We’re not sure that’s involved with how this is spreading, but it’s one hypothesis,” said Todd Bell, professor of veterinary pathology.All milk sold commercially in stores is pasteurized, and research consistently shows pasteurization neutralizes viruses such as influenza. But knowing cows are a biologically suitable home for the flu virus, particularly in their mammary glands, reiterates the dangers of consuming raw milk and raises questions about how milk from infected cows is discarded, Burrough said.“The idea that the mammary glands are being passively infected is put to rest by this paper,” he said. “They’re pumping out tons of virus, and that’s a risk.”While HPAI isn’t usually deadly for cows, it’s often fatal for birds. Since the start of the outbreak in the U.S., more than 97 million birds have been affected, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Commercial poultry flocks where the virus is detected are typically euthanized.The infected dairy cattle samples ISU researchers examined – both mammary glands and respiratory tissues – had receptors for flu strains that originate from birds as well as humans and pigs. The presence of both types of receptors poses added risks, as a single cell infected by avian and mammalian viruses could lead to potentially dangerous mutations, Bell said.The study was published in the July edition of Emerging Infectious Diseases, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s peer-reviewed journal. Thirteen of its 14 co-authors are from Iowa State, including researchers and faculty from across the College of Veterinary Medicine. Another article in the same edition of Emerging Infectious Diseases – with a list of co-authors that includes 10 ISU researchers – describes the initial diagnosis of HPAI in dairy, a finding made at the ISU Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory this spring.Speedy teamwork in the face of new public health threats is essential, said Rahul Nelli, research assistant professor of veterinary diagnostic and production animal medicine.“Having different departments coming together to collaborate was key for this study and will be key for future investigations,” Nelli said.Further research could involve influenza receptors in other species and organs, including a closer look at dairy cattle, Bell said. The just-published study is based on a handful of samples. Scientists’ understanding of how influenza affects cattle will improve as more data is collected and herds are regularly screened.“Surveillance will be really important moving forward, not only through this event but in the years to come,” Burrough said.

May ranked as the month with the second-most birds affected at 5,854,900.This graph shows how many flocks were infected with avian influenza each month so far in 2024.Denise O'KeefeThe only other month to see a loss of more than 1 million birds was July, with 3,446,900. Six flocks were struck by the virus in July.Eight commercial flocks were affected and 545,600 birds were lost in June, while February saw seven flock infections and the loss of 293,600 head of poultry.HPAI struck only one U.S. flock in March, with 31,200 birds involved.Species breakdownMost of the U.S. flock infections of 2024 have involved the turkey industry, but it was the egg industry that lost the most birds.This graph shows the commercial flock types affected by avian influenza to date in 2024.Denise O'KeefeAPHIS has reported 26 commercial meat turkey flock infections, as well as three turkey breeder hen flocks and one turkey breeder tom flock. Collectively, those translated into the loss of 1,246,500 turkeys.Nine laying hen flocks and three pullet flocks have been affected to date in 2024, and those 12 flocks collectively involved 18,744,300 birds.Three broiler flocks and 714,700 broiler chickens have been affected by HPAI in the U.S. this year, while one broiler breeder flock of 66,500 was affected.Three flocks simply identified as “poultry” have also been struck by HPAI, with those bird losses collectively amounting to 143,300. Six upland gamebird flocks have also been hit by the virus in 2024, with bird losses reaching 67,000.Cases by stateMinnesota is the only state to have flock infection numbers in the double digits, with 18 cases so far in 2024.However, Michigan has had the most bird losses in 2024, with 6,724,00 birds affected among seven flocks. Other states to have commercial poultry flocks affected by HPAI in 2024 are Colorado, Iowa, Texas, South Dakota, Missouri, North Carolina, Nebraska, Indiana, Kansas, California and Wisconsin.View our continuing coverage of the global avian influenza situation.

The study found that risk factors for each of these respiratory illnesses do share a common feature—they are linked to cell surface proteins that may be required for viral entry—which, though not surprising, may offer treatment opportunities. The study’s most promising lead, ST6GAL1, is an enzyme that adds a sialic acid to the cell surface, a linkage that has been previously shown to participate in the entry of the influenza virus into human cells. In this study, knockdown of ST6GAL1 using small interfering RNA (siRNA) reduced influenza infectivity by 57% in vitro. This initial experiment, which was performed using adenocarcinoma human alveolar basal epithelial cells (A549), is the first report of a genome-wide-significant loci for influenza, according to the authors. Re-investigating the COVID-19 AncestryDNA cohort While COVID-19 and influenza share symptoms and clinical risk factors, the extent to which these conditions have a common genetic etiology had not been fully clarified. This is partly because host genetic risk factors are well characterized for COVID-19 but not for influenza, with the largest published genome-wide association studies for these conditions including >2 million individuals and about 1,000 individuals, respectively. To understand the extent to which the same host genetic factors influence the risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and influenza, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of influenza infection was performed that also used survey data from 296,313 participants of the AncestryDNA COVID-19 study who consented to the research. Although that study focused on risk factors for COVID-19, participants also indicated if they were tested for influenza in either the 2019–2020 or 2020–2021 flu seasons. Overall, 18,448 (6.2%) participants reported a positive test for influenza and thus were considered cases for our analysis, while the remaining 277,865 participants (including 23,985 with a negative test) were considered population-level controls. Using these data from AncestryDNA, the study tested the association between reported influenza infection and 10 million common (frequency >1%) imputed variants. This analysis was performed separately in three ancestral groups (with >100 influenza cases) defined based on genetic similarity to three populations studied by the 1000 Genomes Project from Europe (254,750), Africa (12,951), and the Americas (26,928). ST6GAL1 is linked to influenza infection Two loci were identified that were associated with influenza infection at a commonly used significance threshold (P < 5×10−8). These loci, noncoding variants found near the ST6GAL1 and B3GALT5 genes, were then evaluated for sensitivity and replication analyses in independent cohorts, using medical records across 1,153,291 individuals from seven biobanks and five ancestral groups, demonstrating the reproducibility of these associations. ST6GAL1, which codes for the enzyme β-galactoside α-2,6-sialyltransferase 1 that catalyzes the addition of sialic acid to galactose, by an α-2,6 linkage, which is found on the human host cell surface glycoproteins and glycolipids in the upper respiratory tract and is used by the virus as attachment factors that facilitate the subsequent engagement with a functional receptor required to enter the target cell. Knockdown of ST6GAL1 results in approximately 50% reduction of in vitro influenza infectivity, consistent with previous findings. In contrast, knockdown of B3GALT5 expression was not associated with a consistent effect on influenza infectivity. COVID-19 and influenza share little genetic etiologically When compared to 24 variants associated with COVID-19 identified by the Host Genetics Initiative (HGI), ten had a consistent direction of effect on both influenza and COVID-19. One variant near the gene ABO—glycosyltransferase enzyme that determines an individual’s ABO blood type by modifying the oligosaccharides on cell surface glycoproteins—showed an inverse relationship between the respiratory diseases, linked to an increase in the risk of influenza infection and a decreased risk for COVID-19. Of note, a recent 23andMe study also reported a similar pattern of opposing associations with COVID-19 and influenza at the ABO locus. The researchers conclude that the lack of significant and directionally consistent associations between reported influenza infection and COVID-19 loci suggests that the two diseases share few—if any—genetic risk factors. Consistent with these findings, the two risk variants for reported influenza identified in the AncestryDNA GWAS (in or near B3GALT5 and ST6GAL1) did not have a directionally consistent association with COVID-19 in the HGI analysis. It is important to note that the study’s influenza-infected population was categorized using self-reporting and does not represent true susceptibility to infection. The control group includes an undetermined number of individuals not exposed to influenza in either season or who were infected but not tested (for example, asymptomatic). This study, led by the Regeneron Genetics Center and published in Nature Genetics, involved researchers from several academic institutes, including the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine, the Colorado Center for Precision Medicine, the Mayo Clinic Project Generation, and the University of California Los Angeles ATLAS Collaboration.

Photo: CanvaTo avoid further spread and mutation of the avian influenza virus, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention plans to spend US$10 million to curb farm worker bird flu infections, including US$5 million for seasonal flu vaccines.The ongoing bird flu outbreak has infected poultry flocks in nearly every US state since 2022 and more than 170 dairy herds in 13 states since March, according to the US Department of Agriculture. In addition, 13 poultry and dairy farm workers have contracted the virus in Colorado, Michigan and Texas, according to reports from the CDC. Of those cases, 9 were detected in July among workers at 2 poultry farms with bird flu in Colorado, reports Reuters.While additional human cases are possible, the risk to the general public from bird flu remains low, according to CDC’s principal director, Nirav Shah.VIDEO: Risks of H5N1 bird flu in dairy, poultry, and peopleMillions against the spread of the bird flu virus Reuters further reports that US$5 million will be allocated to organisations including the National Center for Farmworker Health to educate and train workers on protecting themselves from bird flu, and another US$5 million to providing seasonal flu shots to farm workers.Though the seasonal flu vaccine does not provide protection from bird flu, the vaccine push could reduce the risk that workers become infected with the seasonal flu and bird flu at the same time, which could lead to flu virus mutations, Shah added, further noting that the CDC is hoping to vaccinate all of the nation’s approximately 200,000 livestock workers during this year’s flu shot season and is working with states to develop plans to reach the workers.Join 31,000+ subscribers Subscribe to our newsletter to stay updated about all the need-to-know content in the poultry sector, three times a week.

Partners Purdue University provides funding as a member of The Conversation US. View all partners Email X (Twitter) Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger Ready or not, back-to-school season is here, and kids will be bringing home more than homework. They’ll be carrying germs, too. These viruses and bacteria will be agents that cause the common cold, influenza, norovirus, COVID-19, strep throat and more. There’s a reason why boxes of tissues and sanitizing wipes show up on most school supply lists. As a nursing professor with experience in public health promotion, I have spent the past several years helping the public understand how to prevent the spread of infectious diseases, especially the flu and COVID-19. Here are some ways to minimize illness transmission from school to home. COVID-19 cases likely to rise In what health care providers call the summer wave, COVID-19 infections have been increasing throughout the summer of 2024. As of July 30, 2024, the number of COVID-19 infections has grown or is likely to grow in 35 states and territories. Summer heat waves force people inside and into close proximity. And as record-setting temperatures continue driving this trend, the number of COVID-19 cases is expected to increase. This increase is expected to extend into the 2024–25 school year. Currently, COVID-19 variants KP.3 and KP.3.1.1 are the dominant circulating virus strains. These variants are among the FLiRT variants, nicknamed after the locations of their spike protein mutations. These variants spread more easily from person to person and are able to evade vaccine-induced immunity better than previous strains. These highly contagious COVID-19 strains, combined with the relaxed isolation guidelines that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released in March 2024, are likely to increase classroom disease transmission this coming school year. These updated CDC guidelines apply to all respiratory viruses, not just COVID-19. The new guidelines recommend that everyone stay home when they are sick but also suggest that a person can return to normal activities once symptoms are improving and the person is fever-free for at least 24 hours without the use of fever-reducing medication. While it is too early to know the transmission impact of these guidelines, they may lead to more people coming out of isolation while still infectious. The CDC’s March 2024 guidelines relaxed isolation recommendations. Children play a large role in transmitting the COVID-19 virus. Children often do not have overt symptoms when they are infected with COVID-19, leading to increased contact and spread. A two-year study following over 160,000 households composed of both adults and children found that just over 70% of viral transmissions, including COVID-19, in these households were pediatric index cases, meaning they started with a child. Further, these pediatric index cases were reduced by 60% to 80% during school breaks. This data suggests that COVID-19 infections will continue to increase once the school year starts. Good hygiene habits reduce the spread In May 2024, the CDC also released guidance for preventing classroom spread of infectious disease, including COVID-19 and other common infectious diseases such as the flu, norovirus and strep throat. This guidance places emphasis on proper respiratory etiquette, hand-washing and vaccination. Proper sneeze hygiene includes using tissues and washing your hands. filadendron/E+ via Getty Images Proper cough and sneeze hygiene is especially important to reduce transmission of diseases such as COVID-19 and the flu, which are commonly transmitted through respiratory droplets. Coughs and sneezes create respiratory droplets that can be full of viruses or bacteria. Because these droplets are forcefully expelled, they can be spread around the environment and inhaled by another person. That’s why it is important to turn your face away from others and cover up coughing or sneezing with a tissue and then quickly dispose of the tissue. If a tissue is not available, your sleeve is the next best option. Whichever method you use, it is important to wash your hands afterward. In addition to encouraging proper respiratory etiquette, classrooms should also have appropriate ventilation. The CDC’s classroom guidance also focuses on proper hand-washing. Up to 80% of infectious diseases are spread through touch. Classrooms have countless high-touch surfaces, including light switches, tabletops, shared supplies, doorknobs, sports equipment and toys. Proper hand-washing can prevent about 30% of diarrhea-related illness and about 20% of respiratory infections, such as colds and flu. The CDC also reports that proper hand-washing reduces absenteeism due to gastrointestinal illness by up to 57%. Health care providers recommend COVID-19 and flu vaccines Another important part of reducing classroom spread of infectious disease is keeping children up to date on vaccinations. Proper vaccination can reduce disease transmission rates 40% to 50% for flu and COVID-19, 80% for child pneumococcal cases, upward of 90% for chickenpox and 100% for diseases such as polio and smallpox. Childhood vaccinations can significantly reduce the spread of disease. Halfpoint Images/Moment via Getty Images For the past several years, the CDC has recommended receiving the flu and COVID-19 vaccine at the same time when possible. Despite this recommendation, there has been some hesitancy in the uptake of both vaccines at the same time. A 2024 Canadian study found that 20% of respondents did not see the benefit in co-administration, and another 17% were concerned about adverse reactions of receiving both vaccines together. However, several years of CDC data demonstrates the safety of receiving the flu and COVID-19 vaccines together. Moderna recently released Phase 3 clinical trial data on a new combination vaccine against both the flu and COVID-19. This combination vaccine, currently called mRNA-1083, has demonstrated higher effectiveness when compared with individual vaccines for the flu or COVID-19. Moderna is expected to seek FDA approval soon. This combination vaccine may increase vaccine uptake because only one shot will be required instead of two. Sick kids should stay home The most important way to reduce the spread of germs in school is to follow the principle of keeping kids home when they’re sick. When sick kids go to school, they infect not only other students but teachers and staff too. When teachers get sick, it affects student learning and costs the U.S. billions of dollars each year. Most schools and day care centers have guidelines on when to keep a child at home. As a general rule, a child should stay home from school or day care if they have a fever, vomiting, diarrhea or if they are generally unwell and unable to fully participate in school. Without the presence of a fever, it is OK to go to school with a cough or runny nose, as long as the child feels well enough to participate in class. To return to school or day care, the child should be fever-free for at least 24 hours without the use of fever-reducing medications. When a student is returning to school with respiratory symptoms, consider having them take extra precautions, such as using a mask to protect others for the next five days. If you have concerns about whether to send your child to school, it’s always a good idea to seek advice from your health care provider. Healthy habits boost the immune system Last but not least, focusing on healthy habits such as getting enough sleep and exercise, as well as eating nutritious meals, helps boost the immune system. These actions should be practiced by family members of all ages.

Highly pathogenic Avian Influenza, or the “bird flu,” had spread to over 21 different states, resulting in the depopulation of roughly 50 million commercial birds.Now, in 2024, the United States again faces an Avian Influenza outbreak, but this time, poultry are not the only species being impacted. The current outbreak began in February 2022, and approximately 100.71 million birds have been affected in 48 states since. While a drastic number of birds are being affected this time around, cattle have also been discovered to contract this virus.In March 2024, Avian Influenza H5N1 was detected in cattle for the first time in history at a dairy in Texas. Since, there have been at least 172 confirmed cases of infected dairy cows across 13 states, including Kansas and Oklahoma. Arkansas and Missouri are yet to report any cases. There have been no confirmed cases of H5N1 in beef cattle. According to Brook Duer with the Pennsylvania State Center for Agriculture and Shale Law, a mutation of the H5N1 subtype of the Influenza strain A virus occurred, causing the virus to now impact cattle.“The “cross-over” of a mutated genotype of the H5N1 virus in wild birds to dairy cattle was a one-time event and is not recurring,” said Duer. “So far, there has been little transmission from cattle to other species.”While scientists still don’t know how the virus was first transmitted from poultry to cattle, transmission between cattle has been shown to occur through lactation, hence why the virus has not been seen in beef cattle.“Primary transmission of the strain is through lactation. Suspicion is that it’s probably transferring through the milking machine; it’s not being transferred respiratory,” said Duer. “That is a very good thing because it’s not spreading fast like if it were the respiratory type, and it’s not hitting beef cattle.”In poultry, Avian Influenza is transmitted by respiratory contact, and the virus can rapidly spread through an entire flock.“We don’t have dairy farms where there are 100 cows who are no longer in the milking herd and are being segregated due to the detection of H5N1,” said Duer. “It’s little, tiny pockets of one to three cows at a time.” While Avian Influenza in poultry can be quite detrimental, the virus has shown to be far less fatal in cattle. Infected cattle often recover after experiencing a decrease in milk yield. Other symptoms of H5N1 in dairy cattle are a decline in feed intake, thicker concentrated milk, lethargy, dehydration, and fever.The USDA recommends producers isolate sick cattle from the rest of the herd and closely monitor for other infected animals. Milk from ill dairy cows should be diverted or destroyed.“This is the furthest thing from a fatal virus to a cow, so we have a totally different approach,” said Duer.Effective April 2024, a federal order now requires the pre-movement testing of lactating dairy cattle before crossing state lines. The order also requires all laboratories and state animal officials to report positive test results, according to the USDA.Dairy cows aren’t the only ones contracting this mutated strain of the virus; recent reports from the CDC confirm at least five human cases of H5N1 in the United States.“What we’re dealing with in terms of Influenza is a subtype of Influenza A, and there are four kinds of Influenza: A,B,C, and D,” said Duer. “A and B affect poultry, and A affects humans.” According to Duer, four out of the five confirmed human cases of H5N1 were in people employed at poultry operations, not dairy employees.Currently, the CDC believes the risk to the general public remains low. According to the USDA, those with jobs that expose them to commercial poultry may be at greater risk.Both the USDA and FDA are quite confident about the safety of the food supply, including milk. The pasteurization process and the difference in milk use from infected cattle both ensure the complete safety and quality of milk, reports the FDA.The USDA encourages producers to practice good biosecurity to prevent further infection. Producers should continue to monitor cattle closely and test when disease is suspected.

In June 2024, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended everyone aged 6 months and older receive the updated 2024-2025 COVID-19 and flu vaccines to protect against the upcoming COVID and flu seasons. While COVID-19 and the flu circulate year-round, the fall and winter months typically see a surge in illnesses due to factors like colder weather, increased indoor gatherings, and the spread of germs in school environments. “Many respiratory illnesses begin in crowded classrooms,” explains Jennifer Veltman, MD, chief of infectious diseases at Loma Linda University Health. "After summer break, when children return to school and are in close contact with each other, they can spread infections to their family members, facilitating the transmission of these illnesses." By staying up-to-date with vaccinations, children and adults can help reduce the risk of these illnesses, contributing to a healthier and more resilient community. COVID-19 In 2023, the CDC reported that more than 900,000 people were hospitalized due to COVID-19, and more than 75,000 people died from the virus. Although the risk of COVID has decreased due to the nation's vaccination efforts and herd immunity, it’s not entirely gone. “We're not seeing the overwhelming admissions that we did before, but we're certainly still seeing people being hospitalized with severe COVID,” Veltman says. The coronavirus has been mutating since its inception in 2019, resulting in new variants. The latest COVID-19 booster is better-matched to the currently circulating strains and is more effective at addressing these ongoing mutations. The coronavirus will keep mutating and presenting ongoing risks to society, making it essential to stay current with vaccinations. This is particularly important for individuals over 65, those who are obese, have underlying medical conditions, or are immunocompromised, as they are at higher risk for more severe disease. Flu The influenza virus, commonly known as the flu, is a highly contagious virus that has been around for centuries. During the 2023-2024 flu season, the CDC reported that the flu caused more than 44,900 deaths in the United States. “People get complacent,” Veltman says regarding resistance to the flu shot. “Some believe they will get the flu from the vaccine, but the potential side effects simply indicate that a person's immune system is responding, which is a positive sign.” While some people avoid annual flu shots due to fear of side effects, contracting the flu can trigger negative health consequences and could lead to severe medical conditions, Veltman says. Recent CDC studies have found a strong link between the flu and an increased risk of acute cardiovascular events such as heart attacks and strokes. The research analyzed data from eight flu seasons and found that sudden, serious heart complications were common, affecting 1 in 8 adult patients in the U.S. It also revealed that adults were six times more likely to have a heart attack in the week following a flu diagnosis. “We don’t think of flu vaccines as heart attack prevention, but adults with heart disease, high blood pressure, and diabetes should stay on top of their yearly flu vaccines,” Veltman says. Cold The common cold can be caused by viruses that inflame the membranes lining the nose and throat. While there is no specific vaccine to protect you from getting a cold, Veltman suggests the following tips to stay healthy. Wear a mask in crowded areas or when you are around people with visible symptoms, such as a runny nose. When possible, conduct activities in well-ventilated areas or outside to reduce your risk of getting a cold. Keep hand sanitizer readily available to maintain clean hands. Pregnant women and elderly individuals should consider getting vaccinated for RSV, a respiratory virus that causes cold symptoms.

Robin Avanthay of the Institute of Virology and Immunology in Mittelhäusern, Switzerland, and colleagues present these findings in the open-access journal PLOS Pathogens. Seasonal flu vaccines typically consist of inactivated components of flu virus injected into muscle, helping the body’s immune system to recognize and fight the disease. However, this approach has limited ability to prevent infection where it initially occurs in the upper respiratory tract, and it can foster evolution of new versions of flu capable of evading immune attack. An effective alternative is a live-attenuated vaccine, which uses a modified flu virus that has been weakened so it cannot cause disease. Live-attenuated influenza vaccines can be administered through the nose directly into the upper respiratory tract, where it prompts a multi-pronged immune response against infection. The authors’ novel live-attenuated vaccine candidate induced a strong local immune response that protected pigs against flu virus. However, although the vaccine did not cause any symptoms in pigs, it was shed from the upper respiratory tract for a prolonged time. If such a vaccine were used in humans, there is a chance that it could be transmitted to someone with a compromised immune system, potentially causing health problems. Aiming to strike a balance between advantages and risks, Avanthay and colleagues developed a two-step immunization strategy. Prior to the nasal administration of the live-attenuated flu vaccine candidate called NS1(1-126)-ΔPAX, the animals were primed with a vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) as a vaccine delivery mechanism. VSV represents a promising vector approach across vaccine research. However, in contrast to commonly used VSV-vectored vaccines, the vaccine used in this study was “propagation-defective”—engineered to perform only a single round of infection for safety. When tested in pigs, this strategy resulted in a strong immune response, both body-wide and specifically in the upper respiratory tract where initial flu infection occurs. No infection was detected in the two-step-vaccinated pigs after they were exposed to virulent flu virus. Thus, as the novel immunization approach efficiently blocks flu virus replication in the upper respiratory tract, it may prevent shedding and transmission of flu virus during seasonal epidemics. When compared to pigs that only received NS1(1-126)-ΔPAX on its own, the two-step-vaccinated pigs showed significantly less shedding of the vaccine candidate from their upper respiratory tract. Importantly, the intranasally administered live vaccine boosted the systemic Flu-specific antibody response and resulted in higher frequencies of Flu-specific T helper memory cells, which was the case if the live vaccine was used without prior priming. Thus, this novel two-step vaccination strategy may foster the duration of protective immunity as well as the protection against flu virus variants. The researchers conclude that this novel two-step approach holds promise as a next-generation strategy for fighting flu more effectively, though further testing is needed before this vaccine approach can be used in humans. Co-author Dr. Gert Zimmer summarizes: “A novel prime/boost vaccination strategy against influenza was evaluated in the porcine animal model. We combined the primary intramuscular immunization with a propagation-defective replicon vaccine with the secondary intranasal immunization using a genetically modified live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV), and found that this immunization regimen resulted in reduced LAIV shedding, increased production of specific serum IgG, neutralizing antibodies, Th1 memory cells, and fully protected the animals against homologous virus challenge.” ############ In your coverage, please use this URL to provide access to the freely available article in PLOS Pathogens: http://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1012393 Citation: Avanthay R, Garcia-Nicolas O, Ruggli N, Grau-Roma L, Párraga-Ros E, Summerfield A, et al.

Heat is causi… Editor's Pick Swine & U: Things to remember about Influenza A and pigs at the Fair by Diane DeWitte Aug 4, 2024 Aug 4, 2024 In late March, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service confirmed the H5N1 influenza (Influenza A) virus in dairy cattle in Texas and Kansas. This specific virus had previously devastated poultry as Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) or “High-Path”. While HPAI is fatal to chickens, turkeys and cats, in dairy cattle it causes reduced milk production with recovery and very few cow deaths. A recent white paper from University of Minnesota Extension and the University of Minnesota College of Veterinary Medicine notes that dairy cattle testing shows high loads of the virus in raw milk. In addition, nasal swab, lung tissue and urine samples have also tested positive — indicating they may play a role in transmission. Several human cases of H5 influenza have been officially reported in 2024 and are associated with direct contact with either infected dairy cattle or poultry. At the time of this publication, the Center for Disease Control has stated these cases have been mild with conjunctivitis, respiratory signs, fever, chills, and sore throat reported. Currently, all the people reported to have an H5 influenza virus infection have fully recovered. While cases so far have been mild, influenza researchers have identified changes in the viral genome that may allow the virus to become even more infectious in mammals and perhaps change enough to cause human to human transmission.That all being said, what’s this got to do with pigs at the Fair this summer? Because Influenza A is known to change as it circulates, exhibitors should realize there’s an influenza risk for their pigs. Pig producers are always monitoring and fighting influenza in their animals. This is an additional reminder to be vigilant. Hence these details to be clean, careful and continuous when practicing biosecurity and working with pigs. BiosecurityA core element of Pork Quality Assurance Plus (PQA+) education is biosecurity on the pig premises. Folks who raise pigs want to keep diseases out of their farms; and, if a disease does break out in their herd, to keep it from spreading throughout all the pigs there. To practice ultimate biosecurity, producers, caretakers and exhibitors of pigs are challenged to establish the habit of following specific protocol as they move about the farm.It is important to limit visitors and vehicle traffic to only those who have a reason to be there. Never allow unsupervised visitors. Ask all non-farm workers and visitors to sign the farm visitor log. Require downtime away from pigs or pig facilities, including harvest plants, livestock markets, and exhibitions. Create a barrier to disease entry including showering in/out, washing hands, changing to dedicated farm clothing, coveralls and footwear, and/or wearing disposable coveralls and footwear. Avoid taking food into animal areas.Temporarily isolate all incoming pigs separate from the animals already on the farm. The ultimate isolation situation would be a quarantine facility that is separate or remote from the existing herd. Recommended isolation times range from 14-30 days to ensure that the new or returning pigs can be watched for signs of disease. When conducting daily chores, take care of the isolated pigs last. Use the isolation period as a time to observe and test for diseases and to vaccinate and acclimate new animals. Clean, disinfect and dry facilities and equipment. Thorough cleaning requires removal of all bedding and manure, washing with hot water (preferred) and an appropriate detergent formulated for livestock use. Facilities should be cleaned and disinfected between populations of pigs. All equipment that touches pigs should be cleaned and disinfected after use. This includes sorting boards, floor mats, and any show equipment that has been used. Disinfectants should be used only after cleaning and applied according to label instructions. Facilities and equipment should be allowed to dry after cleaning and disinfection. Drying can occur either by direct sunlight, passage of time, or use of an additional heat source.Keep the family dogs and cats away from the pigs. it’s easy for a free-running pet to bring disease organisms into the barn. Do not rely on cats for rodent control. Exclude wildlife from the barn area. Raccoons, opossums, skunks and groundhogs are all attracted to spilled feed, manure and mortalities. Control rodents with a systematic and regularly serviced bait program. Use fencing, bird netting or other materials to keep birds and other pests out of the barn.Dispose of mortalities in a timely and complete manner. Compost mortalities if possible. Use a rendering service if composting isn’t available. Remember that rendering trucks can transmit disease, so establish a way to keep the truck off the farm premises. Biosecurity is as important on a 4-H swine member’s half-acre as it is on a 2,500-sow pig farm. Disease control and awareness materials have been provided for Minnesota 4-H pig exhibitors in the past, and it’s always a good practice to review them. Read more about biosecurity for exhibition swine at https://z.umn.edu/BiosecurityExhibitionSwine.Minnesota swine exhibitors can find specific 4-H pig enrollment, participation and deadline information at https://extension.umn.edu/projects-and-more/4-h-swine-project.U of M Extension Educators annually provide 4-H exhibitors with details of how to keep their animals healthy, and how to prevent and reduce the spread of diseases to their 4-H projects. An important practice repeatedly highlighted is washing hands with soap and water. The minimum recommendation is scrubbing hands thoroughly for 20 seconds, or about the time it takes to sing “Happy Birthday.”Recordkeeping —VCPRPig health is critical, and when a medical condition requires treatment, it’s important that a veterinarian be part of the equation. In PQA+ education, the concept is referred to as having a VCPR — a Veterinarian-Client-Patient Relationship. Within a VCPR, the client is the swine exhibitor, and the patient is the pig. Even a small seasonal “herd” of show pigs benefits from the medical expertise of a veterinarian to help with medical decisions. Any kind of medical treatment of the pig requires record-keeping. Medical records need to include seven key pieces of information: Date of treatment; ID of animal treated; medication administered; amount of medication used; route of administration; who treated the pig; and withdrawal time of the medication (prior to harvest). Withdrawal time is the amount of time that has been determined that the medication is out of the pig’s system and the meat is safe for human consumption. These records must be kept for 12 months following treatment of the pig. If medication is used in the pig’s water, or it is given medicated feed, the record of that treatment is also required to be kept for 12 months. All these medication practices are in place to ensure that pigs will be kept at optimum health and if they are given medication, their meat will be safe to eat, without worry of drug residue in the carcass. This summer’s local and regional pig shows, and the Minnesota State Fair, are terrific places to view livestock competitions and visit with old friends. Exhibitors should watch for any changing health issues in their pigs — including coughing, diarrhea, fever or blisters. If a pig shows any of these signs, contact a veterinarian immediately. Exhibitors should NEVER take a sick pig to the Fair. Producers visiting the fairs must be diligent about changing clothes and footwear before returning to the pigs at home. Any site where unrelated animals congregate is a place for potential disease pickup. Thorough handwashing during and after a visit to the fair can destroy disease organisms and reduce the chance of taking a disease back home. Don’t be surprised if you hear “Happy Birthday” being sung at the sink!Diane DeWitte is an Extension Educator specializing in swine for the University of Minnesota Extension.

"By keeping areas clean and using fly control methods, such as fine nets or insecticides, we can reduce the risk of virus spread to indoor poultry farms. However, in outdoor farms in other countries, and in wild bird populations, controlling blowflies may be logistically impossible,” said first author and associate professor at Kyushu University’s Faculty of Agriculture, Ryosuke Fujita.A new HPAI vector?The research project collected and analyzed blowfly colonies found near wild crane populations in Izumi city, Kagoshima Prefecture, located in southern Japan. During the winter, the dense population of migrating cranes makes them vulnerable to HPAI. HPAI has also been detected at poultry farms in the area, so the findings in crane colonies are also applicable to the commercial poultry industry, the researchers noted.Of the 648 blowflies collected, 14 carried the bird flu virus. Genetic testing confirmed that the virus strain found in the blowflies in the same as the one infecting the crane colony. "While 14 blowflies may seem like a low number, this represents a prevalence in blowflies of 2.2%, which is a huge percentage compared to other diseases spread by insects,” Fujita explained.Blowflies ingest HPAI from infected dead birds or their waste, unlike other disease vectors like birds and mammals that become infected with the virus. The fly spreads HPAI to commercial poultry and wild birds by contaminating surfaces, food and water or by being eaten by fowl, the researchers hypothesized.Future research will focus on the confirmation that blowflies are HPAI vectors at infected poultry farms and the development of new tools that use artificial intelligence (AI) to predict the potential risk of insects to transmit diseases.View our continuing coverage of the global avian influenza situation.

(AP Photo/Matt Rourke, File) Drug companies developing combination COVID-flu shot By Shalon Stevens Syracuse PUBLISHED 4:00 PM ET Aug. 05, 2024 PUBLISHED 4:00 PM EDT Aug. 05, 2024 SHARE New York has started to see a spike in COVID-19 case numbers ahead of the fall season, when those numbers and flu cases typically rise. In June, Moderna revealed promising study results for its combination COVID-19 and flu vaccine. âIt makes a lot of sense to try to combine the two because I think COVID is definitely evolving into a seasonal respiratory virus,â said Stephen Thomas, the director for the Upstate Global Health Institute. Thomas said COVID peaks arrive in the fall and winter, which corresponds with flu cases. âWhen people are coming in to get their annual influenza shot, they can also â and should still be getting â their annual COVID shot. So to put them together makes a lot of sense. One needle versus two,â Thomas said. He said he believes the combo vaccine will be annual and tailored to the COVID and flu circulating during that time. âThey found that the immune responses to the combination was better than each of the individuals on their own,â Thomas said. With August being National Immunization Awareness Month, Oneida County Health Director Dan Gilmore said the combo vaccine is a positive step forward. âVaccines are one of the greatest achievements of public health in the past 100 years. Itâs been beneficial for untold numbers of people for both keeping them healthy and actually increasing longevity. So, itâs very important to stay current on vaccines if an individual chooses to,â said Gilmore. With 2020 being such an unprecedented time, Gilmore says he believes the state is now in a good place. âThereâs no difficulty obtaining test kits, then when it comes to a vaccine, anybody that would like a vaccine can obtain one," Gilmore said. Pfizer and Novavax are also developing combo flu and COVID shots, but Moderna is the first to report positive phase three results.

PDF FILE The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently announced a strategic initiative to combat the spread of Avian Influenza H5N1 in humans. This move comes as a response to the growing concern over potential outbreaks and the need to protect public health. Understanding Avian Influenza H5N1 Avian Influenza H5N1, commonly known as bird flu, primarily affects birds, especially poultry. However, there have been documented cases of transmission from birds to humans. While human-to-human transmission remains rare, the CDC recognizes the importance of proactive measures to prevent any potential outbreaks. The $10 million allocation The CDC has earmarked $10 million specifically for preventing human infections of Avian Influenza H5N1. This funding will be utilized to implement targeted interventions and research initiatives. The goal is to reduce the risk of transmission and enhance preparedness in case of an outbreak. Targeted strategies The CDC’s approach involves several key strategies:Continue after advertising. Surveillance and monitoring: Rigorous surveillance will help identify any potential cases early on. Monitoring bird populations, especially those in close proximity to humans, is crucial. Vaccination and education: The allocation will support vaccination campaigns for high-risk groups, such as poultry workers and individuals who come into contact with birds. Additionally, educational programs will raise awareness about preventive measures. Research and development: The CDC will invest in research to better understand the virus, its transmission dynamics, and potential mutations. This knowledge will inform effective prevention strategies. Enhanced biosecurity: Strengthening biosecurity measures on farms and in live poultry markets will minimize the risk of transmission from birds to humans. Collaboration and global efforts The fight against Avian Influenza H5N1 is not limited to the United States. The CDC will collaborate with international health organizations, sharing expertise and resources. By working together, the global community can prevent the spread of this potentially deadly virus. Conclusion The CDC’s commitment to allocating $10 million for Avian Influenza H5N1 prevention underscores the importance of proactive measures. By investing in surveillance, education, and research, we can safeguard public health and mitigate the risk of future outbreaks. Let us remain vigilant and united in our efforts to protect both humans and birds from this infectious threat. Remember that Avian Influenza H5N1 remains a serious concern, and continued vigilance is essential. If you have any symptoms or suspect exposure, seek medical attention promptly. Stay informed, follow preventive guidelines, and together, we can minimize the impact of this virus on our communities.

A year later, the H5N1 HPAI-free declaration was made.“To date, Argentina has no HPAI outbreaks and maintains active and passive surveillance activities throughout the national territory,” the WOAH report stated.This H5N1-free declaration follows a similar declaration made in September 2023, when the H5N1 HPAI situation in Argentinian poultry was deemed resolved. Between February 2023 and April 2023, the country had lost more than 2.2 million head of poultry. Infected operations included 13 layer farms, three breeder farms and two broiler farms. While the WOAH has closed its reports on H5N1 avian influenza outbreaks, it still has an open report on untyped H5 HPAI infections in what it refers to as unusual host species in Argentina. Between August and October 2023, 1,881 HPAI-related animal deaths were reported in South American fur seals, South American terns, South American sea lions and southern elephant seals. However, WOAH has not issued any new reports on the matter since October 28, 2023.RecommendedHatchersGiordano HatchCargoSystem ProLifeLatest NewsNational Turkey Federation offering 'Thanksgiving 101' tips and recipesRelated StoriesAvian InfluenzaBlowflies can spread HPAI to commercial poultryAvian InfluenzaWhat the dairy industry can learn from poultry’s HPAI responseAvian InfluenzaFAO warns of rising avian flu threat in Asia-Pacific regionAvian InfluenzaAnother Weld County, Colorado, farm hit with avian fluMore in Avian InfluenzaAvian InfluenzaAvian flu confirmed in poultry flocks in 13 European countriesThe H5N5 variant has been confirmed for the first time at a European poultry farm.Brand InsightsVaccination success depends on crew trainingZoetisContinuous evaluation and training are critical to improving pullet vaccination accuracy.Avian Influenza8 more British Columbia flocks struck by avian fluSo far in 2024, the province has had 22 commercial poultry flocks affected by the virus.Avian InfluenzaLatest Canadian HPAI infections involved variety of speciesOne more flock infection has been reported in Abbotsford, British Columbia.Avian InfluenzaHPAI hits 5 flocks in British Columbia, 1 in CaliforniaAPHIS provides additional information concerning two broiler flocks previously reported as confirmed cases.Avian InfluenzaAustralia commits more funds to H5N1 preparednessAustralian authorities add additional funds to surveillance, biosecurity, vaccines and communications in the face of possible H5N1 incursion.Avian InfluenzaAPHIS updates report on California HPAI casesFlock size numbers for two of four affected operations have been disclosed.Avian InfluenzaMore HPAI reported in California, British Columbia poultryBoth the state and the province have confirmed cases in two commercial flocks.Avian InfluenzaFirst avian flu outbreaks of the season in East AsiaHPAI cases have been reported in poultry and wild birds across Asia from Israel to Japan and South Korea.Avian InfluenzaAvian influenza strikes two California broiler flocksThe number of chickens involved has not yet been disclosed.North AmericaAvian flu infections continue to hit British ColumbiaThe province has had six commercial poultry flocks affected by the virus since October 21.Avian InfluenzaFrance confirms avian flu in vaccinated flocksDucks were found to be positive for the HPAI virus following routine testing, despite them showing no symptoms of the disease.Avian InfluenzaAvian flu hits second broiler flock in California countyThe latest flock infection in Tulare County involved 6,000 broilers.Page 1 of 182Next PageNews and analysis for the global poultry industryFollow WATTPoultry.comFacebook iconLinkedIn iconYouTube iconDelete My DataTopicsPoultry MeatEggPoultry HealthSustainabilityPoultry FutureMoreWebinarsBrand InsightsPodcastsWhite PapersWATT Poultry ChatTop Companies Data DownloadsMagazinesSubscribeAdvertiseAbout UsContact UsMedia RequestPrivacy PolicySite Map© 2024 All rights reserved.Figuring US turkey losses to avian flu in 2022-24 | WATTPoultry.comMarket InformationTop Poultry CompaniesExpert InsightsBlogsRegionsMagazinesSign InPoultry MeatEggPoultry HealthSustainabilityPoultry FutureTopicsPoultry MeatEggPoultry HealthSustainabilityPoultry FutureRegionsMarket InformationTop Poultry CompaniesTop Feed CompaniesAgriculture ProductsDirectory of SuppliersEvent CalendarExpert InsightsWebinarsBrand InsightsPodcastsWhite PapersWATT Poultry ChatTop Companies Data DownloadsMagazinesMoreSign InSubscribeAdvertiseAbout UsContact UsFollow WATTPoultry.comFacebook iconLinkedIn iconYouTube iconSign InFollow WATTPoultry.comFacebook iconLinkedIn iconYouTube iconPoultry MeatEggPoultry HealthSustainabilityPoultry FutureMarket InformationTop Poultry CompaniesExpert InsightsBlogsRegionsMagazinesSubscribeAdvertiseBroilers & TurkeysDiseases & HealthAvian InfluenzaFiguring US turkey losses to avian flu in 2022-24To date, 340 U.S. commercial turkey flocks have been affected and roughly 14.7 million birds have been lost.Roy GraberAugust 9, 2024pink candy | BigStockPhoto.comMore turkey flocks have been lost to highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in the United States during the 2022-24 outbreak than any other commercial poultry flock type.According to information provided by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) and state agriculture agencies, the U.S. turkey industry has lost 340 commercial flocks during the past three years.

Opens in a new tab or window email article Physicians should start preparing now for the upcoming respiratory virus season, according to the CDC in a webinar hosted by Bruce Scott, MD, president of the American Medical Association (AMA) on Tuesday. The webinar focused on strategies for getting patients vaccinated for COVID-19 and flu and putting into action the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices' (ACIP) updated RSV vaccination recommendations. The webinar can be viewed in its entirety here. CDC director Mandy Cohen, MD, MPH, reviewed vaccine recommendations for the 2024-2025 respiratory virus season. Everyone ages 6 months and older should get an updated COVID-19 vaccine and updated influenza vaccine, Cohen said. "We're going to see an updated COVID-19 and flu vaccine here in just a few weeks," she noted. "The flu [vaccine] is actually starting to be available right now, so you can be getting that into your practice ... right now is a great time to pre-order." Cohen also discussed the updated adult RSV vaccination recommendations issued in June. All adults, ages 75 and older, and those ages 60 to 74 with risk factors that might lead to severe respiratory disease should get a one-time RSV vaccine (Arexvy, Abrysvo, mResvia). "Particularly, I want to highlight those who are in a nursing home," Cohen pointed out. "We are seeing more RSV circulating in nursing homes. We really want to make sure anyone who is residing in that group setting is protected from RSV going into this season." In a Q&A session, Demetre Daskalakis, MD, MPH, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, addressed co-administration of the COVID-19, influenza, and RSV vaccines. "Bottom line is, that's a best practice. Co-administering these vaccines is really critical, especially for people where you only have one shot," for getting them vaccinated. "It is safe. We have a long history of COVID and flu [vaccine] co-administration. The data also support the co-administration of RSV vaccine at the same time." Also, administering the vaccines simultaneously does not seem to blunt the immunologic response of any of the vaccines, he emphasized. For infants, there are two options for RSV immunization. One option is for pregnant mothers to get the maternal RSV vaccine (Abrysvo only) between 32 and 36 weeks of gestation; it is usually given sometime between September through January. Another option is for infants under age 8 months, and children 8-19 months with risk factors, to receive the monoclonal antibody nirsevimab (Beyfortus). Nirsevimab is usually administered during the RSV season from October through March. "Ordering and offering immunizations in your clinics is one of the most powerful ways to improve vaccine confidence and increase immunization rates," Cohen said, because convenience is a top reason for patient acceptance and reduces missed opportunities for immunization. The CDC is now providing online immunization and vaccine product summaries, including ordering and availability information. Cohen recommended that practices consider appointing a vaccine champion to streamline office vaccination protocols. "That really helps to make sure your office is set up and prepared for having conversations with patients about vaccination as well as not missing an opportunity to give out those doses," she noted." So every time someone walks into your office, it's an opportunity both to have that conversation and to make sure you're immunizing." For patients who get vaccines in pharmacies, Cohen emphasized that it's important to "close the loop" by making sure pharmacists have all the patient information they need to administer vaccines -- for example, when ordering RSV vaccines, physicians should be sure to provide risk factors for patients ages 60-74 and gestational age for patients who are pregnant. To address vaccine cost barriers among children, Cohen recommended clinicians participate in Vaccines for Children program, which provides all ACIP-recommended vaccines to eligible individuals ages 18 and younger at no or low cost. For adults, Medicaid covers recommended vaccines without cost sharing. Medicare Part B covers flu and COVID-19 vaccines, she said. The RSV vaccine is covered under Medicare Part D, but patients need to get vaccinated at an in-network provider, as do those with Medicare Advantage plans and many of those who have private insurance.

The damp, humid conditions of the season is creating a perfect storm for the flu to rage, affecting residents of all ages, city doctors say.Dr Pooja Bajaj, associate pulmonologist consultant, Sparsh Hospital, describes the situation vividly: âWe are seeing three to four cases a day, sometimes more.Thatâs about a 60-70% rise in cases. As pulmonology specialists, we typically handle fewer flu cases than general practitioners, but we do see patients with asthma and COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), who contract flu and experience exacerbations. These patients often present with poorly controlled symptoms and require admission and oxygen support.â The rise in cases can be attributed to seasonal changes, increased indoor gatherings, and potential new virus strains. Dr Nidhin Mohan, consultant, Narayana Health City, adds, âAmong children and other age groups, we observe a higher infection rate. However, recovery is generally good with timely medical intervention. The elderly, particularly those above 65, are especially vulnerable. We find that H3N2 is the current mutation, and there are a few H1N1 cases as well. We emphasize on yearly influenza vaccination as the strains mutate, requiring updated vaccines as well,â he said.Dr Vivek Anand Padegal, director of pulmonology, Fortis Hospital, sheds light on the unseasonal increase in influenza cases, as it is more common during winters. âFrom seeing 1-4 cases per month, we started recording 20 cases a week over last few weeks, leading to an early outbreak. Symptoms before hospitalisation include fever, cough, body pain, and sore throat. Some patients develop pneumonia. While all age groups are affected, the majority of hospitalised patients are elderly. A few require ICU and ventilation, but most recover in four to five days if detected early and treated with antivirals,â he said.Children and elderly at higher risk: DoctorsChildren and elderly are at higher risk of developing influenza due to weaker immunity, say experts. According to Dr Srikanta J T, consultant, paediatric interventional pulmonology at Aster CMI Hospital, as schools reopen, the close contact among children creates an ideal environment for virus replication, leading to a significant increase in respiratory viral infections, mainly influenza. Among hospitalised children, a very small portion develop acute respiratory distress syndrome, requiring more support,â he says.Dr Sudhir U, consultant - pediatrician & neonatologist, Motherhood Hospitals further says he sees 20-30 children with viral-like illnesses per day in the OPD. âAdditionally, on a weekly basis, weâre admitting 8-10 patients for intensive care. The symptoms are being noticed among kids in the age group of one to five years,â he says.At Manipal Hospitals, Dr Sunil Havannavar, senior consultant, internal medicine, emphasizes being extra cautious, especially for aged patients with comorbidities such as COPD, asthma, diabetes, and hypertension.End of ArticleFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA Visual Stories Previous10 reasons to have 1 pomegranate dailyLifestyleScenic hill station train journeys in North IndiatravelIndiaâs famous tigers and tigresses: The legends of the wildtravelTips for guiding your child to greater happinessLifestyleHow to make South Indian-Style Mysore Masala Dosa at homeFood'Stree 2, 'Aashiqui' and other films of Shraddha Kapoor to watchEntertainmentAI imagines how India's top metros will look like in the next 50 yearsLifestyle15 Indian states and the rice dishes they are famous forFoodHow to extract, store, and apply fresh Aloe Vera to aid hair growthLifestyle8 hybrid animals that were âinventedâ by humansLifestyle Next123Hot PicksArvind Kejriwal Resignation LiveOne Nation, One ElectionPM Narendra Modi BirthdayRyan Wesley RouthKolkata Murder Hearing LiveHarvest Moon Lunar EclipseNorth Carolina RainfallTOP TRENDINGHamster Kombat Daily Cipher CodesVince McMahonChampions Trophy FinalAtishiMS DhoniKolkata Rape CaseWWE Raw HighlightsNEET PG Counselling ScheduleTrump vs KamalaWho is AtishiTrending StoriesIn CityEntire WebsiteUPS vs NPS Calculator: Is A Switch From National Pension Scheme to Unified Pension Scheme Really A No-Brainer?

Everything around you becomes bathed in a warm glow (which isn’t your fever for once).I have been appreciating many things in the last couple of days. Access to plumbing. The invention of medicine. Hydralyte. Being a lesbian and able to live with my girlfriend and endure the horrors together. Hot chips. Thank you hot chips. Of course television was also important as we lay rotting on the couch, but it was actually another modern advance in technology that I have been appreciating most of all. One that doesn’t hurt my flu-ridden eyes, and one I think doesn’t get enough praise from society. It’s … podcasts.The week in audio: The Lost Archive of James Baldwin; Extreme: Muscle Men; Paris Olympics – reviewRead moreMost of the things that I thought as a child would be invented and waiting for me when I grew up didn’t happen. There are no jetpacks. Flying cars don’t exist. Hoverboards aren’t ready.What does exist that I couldn’t have imagined in my wildest dreams, spending hours taping songs and segments from the radio, is an endless expanse of podcasts. A whole world of infinitely varied audio experiences in digital form that I can get immediately on my phone. What exists, right in my hand, is the ability at any moment to have people do what I need: entertain me, educate me, intrigue me, or, most importantly in my convalescence – simply wipe all thoughts from my brain.Podcasts I listen to range from very DIY to highly produced, from smart and funny people talking about celebrity culture to smart and serious people deep-diving into history, to improv comedians doing silly characters for an hour, to a few charming friends chatting about nothing in particular, to narrative fictional stories, to crime-solving, to the daily news. This is what I would have dreamed of as a child if I weren’t so interested in different modes of travel. Well, probably not all the boring news and politics stuff. Or the improv. Think of your nichest interest – there is probably a podcast about it.I only listen to good podcasts, but I know there are also many popular bad ones for anyone out there with terrible taste. It’s a world for everyone.While I was really sick and unable to sleep, but too exhausted to concentrate on a screen, and finding music doing nothing for my dulled brain – I was reminded of how much podcasts helped me when I went through a months-long depressive episode a little while ago. For the first time in my life I was so depressed that I finally understood why some people cannot shower for days, or can flake on deadlines, or not want to see their friends. I had never been like that at all before, always able to push through. It was a difficult time, and scary. I couldn’t talk to anyone; it was hard for me to speak above a quiet mumble; it was difficult even to sit with people in silence. For the first time ever, while my brain continued to think of jokes, I couldn’t recognise them as funny, let alone muster the inclination or the energy to say them out loud. I definitely couldn’t write funny articles, or work. I couldn’t sleep. I couldn’t concentrate on TV, or music. The only thing I could do was put on a podcast, and listen.The week in audio: Suella Braverman on LBC; Dangerous Memories; World of Secrets: The Apartheid Killer – review Read moreThe podcasts soothed my spiky, painful brain. I didn’t need to engage too hard, or react, but I was having my thoughts occupied, and I felt like I was still connected to the world. It was being with people without having to be with people. I could fall asleep, I could go for a walk, I could get up and sit in the garden, because of podcasts. I could just let it wash over me; I could even acknowledge in my brain that a joke I heard was funny, reminding me I still had the ability to recognise humour. I was so depressed that I even voluntarily listened to straight men dissect movies together for hours at a time, nary a woman in sight. My friends will tell you that is a very disturbing sign. Rebecca Shaws only do that when they are VERY depressed. But, I have to admit, even those men helped me through.There are a lot of bad podcasts by annoying people, and all the jokes about podcasting are valid. There are definitely too many people who incorrectly think they are funny and interesting and decide they have a reason to pick up the mic and put their thoughts into the world. Unrelated, listen to my podcast Bring A Plate. But this is a problem that exists in every art form, alongside pure gold.Podcasts mean there is comfort and company if you need it. There is always a voice on the other end, ready to talk about whatever you choose. To engage your brain, or just fill it with benevolent noise. So thank you podcasts, for your service.And of course, thank you again, hot chips.

That's a problem for everyone. • Oregon Capital Chronicle HOME NEWS Politics Environment Education Economy Health Criminal Justice Decision 2024 Commentary ABOUT SUBSCRIBE DONATE Part of States Newsroom Politics Environment Education Economy Health Criminal Justice Decision 2024 5:30 News Story Health Bird flu cases are going undetected, study suggests. That’s a problem for everyone. By: Amy Maxmen - August 5, 2024 5:30 am As bird flu cases go underreported, health officials risk being slow to notice if the virus were to become more contagious. (Getty Images) A new study lends weight to fears that more livestock workers have gotten the bird flu than has been reported. “I am very confident there are more people being infected than we know about,” said Gregory Gray, the infectious disease researcher at the University of Texas Medical Branch who led the study, posted online and under review to be published in a leading infectious disease journal. “Largely, that’s because our surveillance has been so poor.” As bird flu cases go underreported, health officials risk being slow to notice if the virus were to become more contagious. A large surge of infections outside of farmworker communities would trigger the government’s flu surveillance system, but by then it might be too late to contain. “We need to figure out what we can do to stop this thing,” Gray said. “It is not just going away.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention bases decisions on its surveillance. For example, the agency has bird flu vaccines on hand but has decided against offering them to farmworkers, citing a low number of cases. But testing for bird flu among farmworkers remains rare, which is why Gray’s research stands out as the first to look for signs of prior, undiagnosed infections in people who had been exposed to sick dairy cattle — and who had become ill and recovered. Gray’s team detected signs of prior bird flu infections in workers from two dairy farms that had outbreaks in Texas earlier this year. They analyzed blood samples from 14 farmworkers who had not been tested for the virus and found antibodies against it in two. This is a nearly 15% hit rate from only two dairy farms out of more than 170 with bird flu outbreaks in 13 states this year. One of the workers with antibodies had been taking medicine for a lingering cough when he agreed to allow researchers to analyze his blood in April. The other had recently recovered from a respiratory illness. She didn’t know what had caused it but told researchers that untested farmworkers around her had been sick too. Richard Webby, director of the World Health Organization Collaborating Center for Influenza at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, said the results confirmed his suspicions that the 13 human bird flu cases reported this year by the CDC were an undercount. “Maybe what we see isn’t exactly the tip of the iceberg, but it’s certainly not the whole story,” Webby said. Little testing of farmworkers Although small, the study gives fresh urgency to reports of undiagnosed ailments among farmworkers and veterinarians. The CDC has warned that if people are infected by the seasonal flu and the bird flu simultaneously, the two types of viruses could swap genes in a way that allows the bird flu to spread between people as easily as seasonal varieties. No evidence suggests that’s happening now. And asymptomatic cases of the bird flu appear to be rare, according to a Michigan antibody study described by the CDC on July 19. Researchers analyzed blood samples from 35 workers from dairy farms that had outbreaks in Michigan, and none showed signs of missed infections. Unlike the study in Texas, these workers hadn’t fallen sick. “It’s a small study, but a first step,” said Natasha Bagdasarian, Michigan’s chief medical executive. She said that the state was boosting outreach to test farmworkers but its efforts were complicated by systemic issues like precarious employment that renders them vulnerable to getting fired for calling out sick. Without more assistance for farmworkers, and cooperation between the government and the livestock industry, Gray said, the U.S. risks remaining in the dark about this virus. “There’s a lot of genomic studies and laboratory work, but farms are where the real action is,” Gray said, “and we’re not watching.” Communication breakdown A dairy worker in Colorado told KFF Health News that he sought medical care about a month ago for eye irritation — a common symptom of the bird flu. The doctor conducted a usual checkup, complete with a urine analysis. But the farmworker hadn’t heard of the bird flu, and the clinician didn’t mention it or test for the virus. “They told me I had nothing,” he said in Spanish, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he feared retaliation from employers. This dairy worker and two in Texas said their employers have not provided goggles, N95 masks, or aprons to protect them from milk and other fluids that could be contaminated with the virus. Buying their own gear is a tall order because money is tight. As is going to the doctor. One worker in Texas said he didn’t seek care for piercing headaches and a sore throat because he doesn’t have health insurance and can’t afford the cost. He guessed the symptoms were from laboring long hours in sweltering barns with limited water. “They don’t give you water or anything,” he said. “You bring your own bottles.” But there’s no way to know the cause of symptoms — whether bird flu or something else — without testing. About a fifth of workers on livestock farms are uninsured, according to a KFF analysis, and a similar share have household incomes of less than $40,000 a year. The three farmworkers hadn’t heard of the bird flu from their employers or state health officials, never mind offers of tests. The CDC boasted in a recent update that, through its partnership with Meta, the company that owns Facebook and Instagram, bird flu posts have flickered across computer and smartphone screens more than 10 million times. Such outreach is lost on farmworkers who aren’t scrolling, don’t speak English or Spanish, or are without smartphones and internet access, said Bethany Boggess Alcauter, director of research and public health programs at the National Center for Farmworker Health. She and others said that offers of protective gear from health officials weren’t reaching farms. “We’ve heard that employers have been reticent to take them up on the offer,” said Christine Sauvé, policy and engagement manager at the Michigan Immigrant Rights Center. “If this starts to transmit more easily person to person, we’re in trouble,” she said, “because farmworker housing units are so crowded and have poor ventilation.” Clinics might alert health officials if sick farmworkers seek medical care. But many farmworkers don’t because they lack health insurance and could be fired for missing work. “The biggest fear we hear about is retaliation from employers, or that someone might be blacklisted from other jobs,” Sauvé said. Flu surveillance The CDC assesses the current bird flu situation as a low public health risk because the country’s flu surveillance system hasn’t flagged troubling alerts. The system scans for abnormal increases in hospital visits. Nothing odd has turned up there. It also analyzes a subset of patient samples for unusual types of flu viruses. Since late February, the agency has assessed about 36,000 samples. No bird flu. However, Samuel Scarpino, an epidemiologist who specializes in disease surveillance, said this system would miss many emerging health threats because, by definition, they start with a relatively small number of infections. Roughly 200,000 people work on farms with livestock in the United States, according to the CDC. That’s a mere 0.1% of the country’s population. Scarpino said the CDC’s surveillance would be triggered if people started dying from the bird flu. The 13 known cases have been mild. And the system will probably pick up surges if the virus spreads beyond farmworkers and their closest contacts — but by then it may be too late to contain. “We don’t want to find ourselves in another covid situation,” Scarpino said, recalling how schools, restaurants, and businesses needed to close because the coronavirus was too widespread to control through testing and targeted, individual isolation. “By the time we were catching cases,” he said, “there were so many that we were only left with bad options.” Troubling signs Researchers warn that the H5N1 bird flu virus has evolved to be more infectious to mammals, including humans, in the past couple of years. This drives home the need to keep an eye on what’s happening as the outbreak spreads to dairy farms across the country. The bird flu virus appears be spreading mainly through milk and milking equipment. But for the first time, researchers reported in May and July that it spread inefficiently through the air between a few laboratory ferrets kept inches apart. And in cattle experiments, some cows were infected by breathing in virus-laden microscopic droplets — the sort of thing that could happen if an infected cow was coughing in close proximity to another. Cows do, in fact, cough. The new study from Texas notes that cattle coughed during outbreaks on the farms and showed other signs of respiratory illness. Other observations were ominous: About half of some 40 cats on one farm died suddenly at the peak of its outbreak, probably from lapping up raw milk suffused with bird flu virus. Most people diagnosed with the bird flu have been infected from animals. In his new study, Gray saw a hint that the virus may occasionally spread from person to person, but he added that this remains conjecture. One of the two people who had antibodies worked in the farm’s cafeteria adjacent to the milking parlor — alongside farmworkers but not cattle. “We need to find ways to have better surveillance,” he said, “so we can make informed decisions rather than decisions based on guesswork.” GET THE MORNING HEADLINES.

That’s a problem for everyone. by Amy Maxmen, Oregon Capital Chronicle August 5, 2024 Bird flu cases are going undetected, study suggests. That’s a problem for everyone. by Amy Maxmen, Oregon Capital Chronicle August 5, 2024 A new study lends weight to fears that more livestock workers have gotten the bird flu than has been reported. “I am very confident there are more people being infected than we know about,” said Gregory Gray, the infectious disease researcher at the University of Texas Medical Branch who led the study, posted online and under review to be published in a leading infectious disease journal. “Largely, that’s because our surveillance has been so poor.” As bird flu cases go underreported, health officials risk being slow to notice if the virus were to become more contagious. A large surge of infections outside of farmworker communities would trigger the government’s flu surveillance system, but by then it might be too late to contain. “We need to figure out what we can do to stop this thing,” Gray said. “It is not just going away.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention bases decisions on its surveillance. For example, the agency has bird flu vaccines on hand but has decided against offering them to farmworkers, citing a low number of cases. But testing for bird flu among farmworkers remains rare, which is why Gray’s research stands out as the first to look for signs of prior, undiagnosed infections in people who had been exposed to sick dairy cattle — and who had become ill and recovered. Gray’s team detected signs of prior bird flu infections in workers from two dairy farms that had outbreaks in Texas earlier this year. They analyzed blood samples from 14 farmworkers who had not been tested for the virus and found antibodies against it in two. This is a nearly 15% hit rate from only two dairy farms out of more than 170 with bird flu outbreaks in 13 states this year. One of the workers with antibodies had been taking medicine for a lingering cough when he agreed to allow researchers to analyze his blood in April. The other had recently recovered from a respiratory illness. She didn’t know what had caused it but told researchers that untested farmworkers around her had been sick too. Richard Webby, director of the World Health Organization Collaborating Center for Influenza at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, said the results confirmed his suspicions that the 13 human bird flu cases reported this year by the CDC were an undercount. “Maybe what we see isn’t exactly the tip of the iceberg, but it’s certainly not the whole story,” Webby said. Little testing of farmworkers Although small, the study gives fresh urgency to reports of undiagnosed ailments among farmworkers and veterinarians. The CDC has warned that if people are infected by the seasonal flu and the bird flu simultaneously, the two types of viruses could swap genes in a way that allows the bird flu to spread between people as easily as seasonal varieties. No evidence suggests that’s happening now. And asymptomatic cases of the bird flu appear to be rare, according to a Michigan antibody study described by the CDC on July 19. Researchers analyzed blood samples from 35 workers from dairy farms that had outbreaks in Michigan, and none showed signs of missed infections. Unlike the study in Texas, these workers hadn’t fallen sick. “It’s a small study, but a first step,” said Natasha Bagdasarian, Michigan’s chief medical executive. She said that the state was boosting outreach to test farmworkers but its efforts were complicated by systemic issues like precarious employment that renders them vulnerable to getting fired for calling out sick. Without more assistance for farmworkers, and cooperation between the government and the livestock industry, Gray said, the U.S. risks remaining in the dark about this virus. “There’s a lot of genomic studies and laboratory work, but farms are where the real action is,” Gray said, “and we’re not watching.” Communication breakdown A dairy worker in Colorado told KFF Health News that he sought medical care about a month ago for eye irritation — a common symptom of the bird flu. The doctor conducted a usual checkup, complete with a urine analysis. But the farmworker hadn’t heard of the bird flu, and the clinician didn’t mention it or test for the virus. “They told me I had nothing,” he said in Spanish, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he feared retaliation from employers. This dairy worker and two in Texas said their employers have not provided goggles, N95 masks, or aprons to protect them from milk and other fluids that could be contaminated with the virus. Buying their own gear is a tall order because money is tight. As is going to the doctor. One worker in Texas said he didn’t seek care for piercing headaches and a sore throat because he doesn’t have health insurance and can’t afford the cost. He guessed the symptoms were from laboring long hours in sweltering barns with limited water. “They don’t give you water or anything,” he said. “You bring your own bottles.” But there’s no way to know the cause of symptoms — whether bird flu or something else — without testing. About a fifth of workers on livestock farms are uninsured, according to a KFF analysis, and a similar share have household incomes of less than $40,000 a year. The three farmworkers hadn’t heard of the bird flu from their employers or state health officials, never mind offers of tests. The CDC boasted in a recent update that, through its partnership with Meta, the company that owns Facebook and Instagram, bird flu posts have flickered across computer and smartphone screens more than 10 million times. Such outreach is lost on farmworkers who aren’t scrolling, don’t speak English or Spanish, or are without smartphones and internet access, said Bethany Boggess Alcauter, director of research and public health programs at the National Center for Farmworker Health. She and others said that offers of protective gear from health officials weren’t reaching farms. “We’ve heard that employers have been reticent to take them up on the offer,” said Christine Sauvé, policy and engagement manager at the Michigan Immigrant Rights Center. “If this starts to transmit more easily person to person, we’re in trouble,” she said, “because farmworker housing units are so crowded and have poor ventilation.” Clinics might alert health officials if sick farmworkers seek medical care. But many farmworkers don’t because they lack health insurance and could be fired for missing work. “The biggest fear we hear about is retaliation from employers, or that someone might be blacklisted from other jobs,” Sauvé said. Flu surveillance The CDC assesses the current bird flu situation as a low public health risk because the country’s flu surveillance system hasn’t flagged troubling alerts. The system scans for abnormal increases in hospital visits. Nothing odd has turned up there. It also analyzes a subset of patient samples for unusual types of flu viruses. Since late February, the agency has assessed about 36,000 samples. No bird flu. However, Samuel Scarpino, an epidemiologist who specializes in disease surveillance, said this system would miss many emerging health threats because, by definition, they start with a relatively small number of infections. Roughly 200,000 people work on farms with livestock in the United States, according to the CDC. That’s a mere 0.1% of the country’s population. Scarpino said the CDC’s surveillance would be triggered if people started dying from the bird flu. The 13 known cases have been mild. And the system will probably pick up surges if the virus spreads beyond farmworkers and their closest contacts — but by then it may be too late to contain. “We don’t want to find ourselves in another covid situation,” Scarpino said, recalling how schools, restaurants, and businesses needed to close because the coronavirus was too widespread to control through testing and targeted, individual isolation. “By the time we were catching cases,” he said, “there were so many that we were only left with bad options.” Troubling signs Researchers warn that the H5N1 bird flu virus has evolved to be more infectious to mammals, including humans, in the past couple of years.

By: Natalia Escalante Posted and last updated LANSING, Mich. (WXYZ — A human case of swine flu, or influenza A H3N2v, was identified in Ingham County, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services said on Friday.Health officials say the Ingham County resident tested positive for the virus in late July. The specimen was sent to MDHHS for additional monitoring through a program with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It was again confirmed as swine flu.Officials are continuing to investigate the source of the person’s exposure.“While we believe this is an isolated case, Michigan residents should monitor for flu-like symptoms: fever, respiratory symptoms like cough and runny nose and body aches,” Dr. Natasha Bagdasarian, Michigan's chief medical executive, said in a statement. “If you have these symptoms, we recommend taking a test for influenza as well as COVID-19. Home COVID-19 tests are widely available, and both flu and COVID-19 tests are available at many pharmacies, urgent cares and clinics. Regardless of test results, please stay at home until you have recovered.”MDHHS says emergency department visits for influenza are low in the state at this time. They believe the risk of spread of swine flu to the general public is also low.Since the virus is often linked to pigs or swine, the state health department is advising the following precautions to avoid potential exposure at farms, fairs and exhibits:Refrain from eating or drinking in livestock barns or show rings.Do not take toys, pacifiers, cups, baby bottles, strollers or similar items into pig areas.Anyone who is at high risk of serious flu complications and planning to attend a fair should avoid pigs and swine barns.Wash hands often with soap and water. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand rub.Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth. Germs spread this way.Symptoms for influenza including swine flu can sometimes get severe. If you experience respiratory symptoms after recently being exposed to livestock, you are urged to talk with your doctor to consider testing. Vaccines used for seasonal flu can also be used to treat swine flu, officials said.For more information on swine flu, visit the CDC's website. Copyright 2024 Scripps Media, Inc. All rights reserved.

Debbie James 05 August 2024 https://www.fwi.co.uk More in Health and welfarePoultry US farmworkers to have flu vaccination to curb avian influenza Debbie James 05 August 2024 >More in Health and welfarePoultry © AdobeStock/Carl Banks Farmworkers in the US are being offered free seasonal flu jabs to help curb mutations of the avian influenza (AI) virus, but the chairman of the body representing UK egg producers says a similar approach is unlikely to be needed here. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is spending $10 million on a package of measures, with half that budget earmarked for vaccinating 200,000 farm workers, after several people developed bird flu. However it says the risk to the general public from the disease is low. See also: Royal Welsh sees return of poultry after bird flu ban In another worrying development, the virus has also jumped to dairy cows with more than 170 herds in 13 states testing positive since March. The CDC believes that preventing seasonal flu in workers, many of whom are also exposed to bird flu, could reduce the risk of new strains emerging. In the UK, James Baxter, chairman of the British Free Range Egg Producers Association (BFREPA), said he was confident that Defra was continually monitoring the AI situation and doesn’t anticipate flu vaccinations being offered. “There are significant operational differences between the US and the UK in both the dairy and poultry industries, practices are quite different,’’ said Mr Baxter. What flu vaccination doesn’t do is give people protection from bird flu. But the CDC says it does reduce the likelihood of workers becoming infected with the seasonal flu and bird flu at the same time, which it suggests could lead to virus mutations. Spread to dairy The US has a dedicated National Center for Farmworker Health and some of the money will be allocated to help it educate and train workers to protect themselves from AI. The ultimate aim is to stop the spread of bird flu among dairy cows and eventually eradicate it. Legislation is currently being drafted to allow dairy farmers to be compensated for any milk losses associated with AI infection. Poultry flocks in nearly every US state have been infected since the virus first emerged in 2022. The pharmaceutical industry is researching the development of a human vaccine against the H5N1 avian flu virus. It is understood that Argentina-based Sinergium Biotech has developed H5N1 candidate vaccines.

The World Health Organization on Wednesday announced that the first laboratory-confirmed human case of infection with H5N2 avian influenza virus had been reported from Mexico. Mexicoâs health ministry said the 59-year-old man had âa history of chronic kidney disease, type 2 diabetes (and) long-standing systemic arterial hypertensionâ. He had been bedridden for three weeks before the onset of acute symptoms, developing fever, shortness of breath, diarrhoea, nausea and general malaise on April 17. The man was taken to hospital in Mexico City a week later and died that day. âThe death is a multi-factorial death, not a death attributable to H5N2,â WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier told journalists in Geneva on Friday. His body was tested for flu and other viruses, and H5N2 was detected, Lindmeier said. Seventeen hospital contacts were identified but all tested negative for influenza. In the manâs place of residence, 12 contacts in the weeks beforehand were identified. All likewise tested negative. âThe infection of H5N2 is being investigated to see whether he was infected by somebody visiting or by any contact with any animals before,â Lindmeier said. The WHO on Wednesday said that the source of exposure to the virus was unknown, though H5N2 viruses have been reported in poultry in Mexico. The United Nationsâ health agency assesses the current risk to the general population posed by the virus as low. - Two-year-old catches H5N1 - Later on Friday, the WHO said a two-and-a-half-year-old girl tested positive for H5N1, a different strain of bird flu, and needed hospital intensive care treatment in Australia after returning from India. âThis is the first confirmed human infection caused by avian influenza A(H5N1) virus detected and reported by Australia,â a statement said. âThe exposure likely occurred in Indiaâ where the girl had travelled, and where this group of âviruses has been detected in birds in the past,â the WHO added. The girl had travelled to Kolkata from February 12 to 29, returned to Australia on March 1 and was admitted to a hospital in in the southeastern Victoria state the following day. The girl is reported to be well, the WHO said, while no relatives in either Australia or India have developed symptoms. - H5N1 spread - H5N1 first emerged in 1996 but since 2020, the number of outbreaks in birds has surged exponentially, alongside an increase in the number of infected mammals. The strain has led to the deaths of tens of millions of poultry, with wild birds and land and marine mammals also infected. The WHO said that from 2003 to May 22 this year, 891 cases of human H5N1 infections, including 463 deaths, were reported from 24 countries. The human cases recorded in Europe and the United States since the virus surged have largely been mild. H5N1 has been spreading for weeks among dairy cow herds in the United States, with a small number of cases reported among humans. But none of them are human-to-human infections, with the disease jumping instead from cattle to people, authorities have said. - Low food risk - Markus Lipp, senior food safety officer at the UNâs Food and Agriculture Organization, said the risk of contracting avian influenza though eating poultry was ânegligibly lowâ. âIn all the hundred years of avian influenza... there has not been any demonstrated food-borne transmission,â he told the media briefing via video-link from the FAOâs headquarters in Rome. âHumans do not have avian influenza receptors in their gastro-intestinal tract, contrary to certain animal species, as far as we know. So there is a very slim likelihood, just from that perspective.â MALBATT 850-12 members feared injured after explosion in Lebanon Pertukaran pengerusi lembaga pengarah UiTM tidak berkaitan kes CBT - Zambry Investment losses in FashionValet: MACC spot suspicious transactions Kerugian pelaburan dalam FashionValet: SPRM kesan beberapa transaksi mencurigakan Kes kehilangan beg berisi RM1 juta, polis tahan dua pengawal keselamatan Recommended stories TODAY NEWS 1.MALBATT 850-12 members feared injured after explosion in Lebanon 2.Investment losses in FashionValet: MACC spot suspicious transactions 3.Kerugian pelaburan dalam FashionValet: SPRM kesan beberapa transaksi mencurigakan 4.Kes kehilangan beg berisi RM1 juta, polis tahan dua pengawal keselamatan 5.MAF armoured vehicle transporter overturns on KL-Karak highway Home Contact us RSS Archive Advertise with us Privacy Policy SUN MEDIA CORPORATION SDN BHD (221220-K) Level 4, Lot 6 Jalan 51/217,46050 Petaling Jaya, Selangor,Malaysia Tel: +603-7784 6688 Fax: +603-7785 2625 Copyright Â© 2024 Sun Media Corporation Sdn.

Ⓒ 2024 Dotdash Media, Inc. — All rights reserved Kids' Health Cold & Flu When Is It Too Late to Get a Flu Shot? By Vincent Iannelli, MD Updated on August 07, 2024 Medically reviewed by Daniel Combs, MD Print Close While you usually want to get a flu shot well before flu season gets started, that isn't always possible. With flu shot delays or shortages, your child might not always be able to get a flu shot when you want. Steve Jacobs / Getty Images Late Flu Shots So when is it too late to get vaccinated against the flu? The CDC recommends getting vaccinated early, but they also say, "Getting vaccinated later, however, can still be beneficial and vaccination should continue to be offered throughout the flu season, even into January or later." So it is really never too late to get a flu vaccine. When Should You Get a Flu Shot? While ideally, you should have gotten your flu shot by September or October, that sometimes doesn't happen. Why wait? The early start to a flu season might catch you by surprise so that you simply didn't have time to get your kids their flu vaccine. Others might wait, thinking they didn't need one, but then became concerned about the reports of how bad flu season has been the last few years. Of course, it is always better to get a flu shot much earlier so that you are protected for the full flu season. Finding Flu Shots Because of the flu shot delays and shortages in past years, finding a flu shot, even if you want one, has sometimes been difficult. Increased demands as flu activity increases have a lot of people looking for flu vaccine who might otherwise have skipped getting vaccinated though. That could have meant that your healthcare provider was already out by the time you wanted one. If your own pediatrician does run out of flu shots, you might check with your local health department, hospital, or pharmacies, and find a flu shot wherever you can. For some groups, the flu shot could pose risks. Find out who should not get the flu shot and why. Frequently Asked Questions Should you get a flu shot if you have a cold? If you have a mild cold, it should be okay to get a flu shot. However, it's best to check in with a healthcare provider first, just to be safe. If you have a high fever or feel any more serious symptoms of sickness, you will likely be advised to wait before getting a flu shot. Should you get a flu shot if you've already had the flu? Yes. Even if you've had the flu this year, the flu shot covers different strains, so it can help protect you from getting the flu again. When should you get the flu shot? For the best protection, get it as early in the flu season—ideally by the end of October. However, even if you are late, it's still a good idea to get a flu shot. Flu activity peaks in February and can last as late as May. 3 Sources Verywell Health uses only high-quality sources, including peer-reviewed studies, to support the facts within our articles.

ByTapatrisha Das, Delhi Aug 06, 2024 08:51 PM IST Read this news in brief form Share Via Copy Link From temperature rise to changes in animal habitats, here are a few ways by which global warming can accelerate the rise of flu cases. There has been a surge in the number of flu cases this year. The numbers seem to keep rising. Climate change and global warming are believed to have significant impacts on the health of people. In an interview with HT Lifestyle, Dr Vidhe Sharma, MD, physician, Ruby Hall Clinic, Hinjawadi, pointed out how global warming and the surge in number of flu cases are interconnected by several factors. Climate change and global warming are believed to have significant impacts on the health of people.(Pixabay ) Climate change and seasonal patterns:Global warming alters temperature and precipitation patterns, which can affect the timing and duration of seasons. This can lead to shifts in the timing and intensity of flu seasons, potentially extending or altering when flu viruses are active. This further makes people become more exposed to the disease. Temperature and virus survival:Warmer temperatures can allow some viruses, including influenza viruses, to survive for longer periods outside of hosts. This might increase the likelihood of transmission in certain environments. ALSO READ: Rising temperatures, longer monsoons make dengue constant danger in South Asia; tips to address this evolving threat Human behaviour changes:Changes in climate can also influence human behavior, such as spending more time indoors or changes in migration patterns, which can impact the spread of infectious diseases like the flu. Ecological and animal factors:Climate change affects ecosystems and can lead to changes in animal habitats and behaviors. This can influence the prevalence and transmission of zoonotic diseases (those that spread from animals to humans), some of which may include influenza viruses, and affect human being severely. ALSO READ: Protecting against Zika virus: Zika vs dengue diagnosis challenges and tips for mosquito bite prevention Health impacts and vulnerability:Climate change can exacerbate health vulnerabilities in populations, making them more susceptible to infections like the flu due to stress, malnutrition, or displacement from extreme weather events. “Overall, while the direct link between global warming and flu cases is complex and multifaceted, these factors illustrate how changes in climate can contribute to shifts in disease patterns, including the incidence of influenza,” added Dr Vidhe Sharma.

Experts say it poses a risk for the spread of bird flu.Ben Thorp / WFYI Between July and October states across the country hold their annual state fairs. The events are known for things like Ferris wheels and corn dogs, sculptures made entirely from butter and the biggest pig in the state. But state fairs can also be places where it’s easier to spread disease –– bringing humans and animals from farms across the state into close contact. That’s of particular concern this year, as H5N1 or bird flu infections have been confirmed in dairy cattle in 13 U.S. states for the first time ever. The virus has also infected four dairy workers across Michigan, Texas, and Colorado. But that’s not keeping many fairgoers from lining up in front of the cattle nosing their way out of their barn fences. Mel Ventimiglia stood by several cows with his grandkids inside a barn at the Indiana State Fair in Indianapolis. He said bird flu isn’t even on his radar. “I haven’t heard anybody mention it except for you,” he told Side Effects. “Hopefully, I forget about it pretty quickly.” At another nearby cattle barn, farmer Randy Mason says he follows basic precautions to keep his cattle from getting sick while at the fair, but he’s not particularly worried. “A lot of that in my opinion gets overblown,” he said. “They get one or two cases and then it becomes –– like everything the government does –– it becomes overblown and out of proportion.” But across the country, bird flu infections have been confirmed in nearly 200 herds, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That’s led officials at some state fairs to enact stricter rules to keep the virus from spreading. In Minnesota, which has detected cases of bird flu within its dairy cattle, the state is requiring all cows to have a negative bird flu test before coming to the state fair. That’s not the case in many other states, however, including Indiana, where there hasn’t been confirmed cases of bird flu. “Since we've not had a diagnosis, we've not put those additional measures,” said Bret Marsh, Indiana state veterinarian. He said the state has told farmers to keep an eye out for signs of bird flu in their animals. They have also communicated to farmers the risks of spreading illness when coming to the fair and advised that animals are quarantined for 30 days after being shown –– but without a positive test, Marsh said, the state doesn’t need to put tighter restrictions in place. Why are state fairs a concern? But scientists widely agree that there is not enough testing going on to fully understand which states have cows infected with bird flu. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said states like Indiana don’t have any positive bird flu cases in cattle because they aren’t looking for them. “The assumption should be, this virus is in the state of Indiana, we just haven't found it yet,” he said. “That's what they should be messaging, not ‘Our cows are free.’ That's foolish to believe.” That makes sites like state fairs –– where humans will be coming into contact with different animals –– especially concerning. Scientists worry that the bird flu could mutate to become a human virus if given the opportunity. Currently, the virus seems to only have infected humans coming in direct contact with the udders and equipment used on infected cows, and have resulted in cases of conjunctivitis or pink eye in humans. The broader concern is that the virus could mutate into a respiratory virus which would spread more easily from person to person. And fairs have a history of being places where that spillover –– from animals to humans –– happen. In 2012 a major swine flu outbreak led to over 300 infections in the U.S., with the majority of those associated with exposure at agricultural fairs. And last year, the CDC reported that two people caught swine flu after visiting pig exhibits. Each time an influenza virus jumps into a new host it’s given an opportunity to evolve, potentially becoming one that could easily spread through humans. Experts worry that the risk of H5N1 becoming a human virus could be substantially heightened if the virus makes it to pigs in particular because they are a perfect mixing vessel for viruses from different species. This means that the different viruses can exchange genetic material and learn from one another, potentially mutating and becoming more adept at infecting humans. “One of the things that people bring up so much about Covid-19 are the animal markets in China, where you have multiple different animals and different species interacting with each other,” Adalja said. “Similar things happen at state fairs in the United States. That's not really any different.” Andrew Bowman, professor of veterinary preventive medicine at the Ohio State University, agrees that the co-mingling of animals and people at state fairs poses a risk. “We've thought about new pandemic viruses arising from Southeast Asian live animal markets. And we think, ‘Oh, we would never do that in the U.S.’ Well, fairs kind of mimic that,” he said. The risk to humans is still low Still, experts like Bowman say that isn’t a reason to miss out on the state fair altogether. “I'm still going to the fair, and my family is still going to the fair. I had a milkshake when I was there,” Bowman said. He added that at-risk populations, such as the immunocompromised, should consider avoiding the cattle barn this year. “You know, exercise caution and really kind of think about which contacts [you] need to have,” Bowman said. “Can I enjoy the animal exhibits, maybe from a little further distance, and not get right in the middle of it?” The CDC issued guidance in June for state fairs to reduce the spread of bird flu, including a prohibition on dumping milk on the ground, because raw milk from infected cattle is likely to carry live virus. The guidance also advises keeping cows from different herds apart, and encourages visitors to wash their hands before leaving a barn. Earlier this year the U.S. Department of Agriculture instituted a rule requiring cows test negative for the virus before crossing state lines. Still, the risk to humans from the bird flu virus remains low, according to the CDC’s assessment. Side Effects Public Media is a health reporting collaboration based at WFYI in Indianapolis.

Illustrative photo (Source: khmertimeskh.com) Phnom Penh (VNA) – Cambodia's Ministry of Health on August 3 announced the discovery of a new case of H5N1 avian influenza in a 16-year-old girl from Svay Rieng province’s Chantrea district, bringing its total number of human infections to nine since the beginning of the year. As reported by Khmer Times, the press release from the ministry stated that the girl had a fever, cough, sore throat, exhaustion, and trouble breathing. She is presently undergoing intensive treatment due to the seriousness of her condition. An official investigation revealed that four days before the onset of her illness, nine chickens had died at her and her neighbour’s homes and the girl had come into contact with and handled the dead chickens. On August 1, the ministry also issued a press release confirming a four-year-old boy, who lives in Svay Rieng's Romeas Hek district, tested positive for the bird flu virus. H5N1 is a subtype of influenza that predominantly infects birds. However, the virus can also infect mammals that have been exposed to infected birds in some cases, with symptoms being frequently severe or fatal. Since 2003, Cambodia has recorded a total of 71 human cases of H5N1, of whom 42 succumbed to the disease./.

These critical vaccines could take a year or more to develop and deploy, with late-stage testing expected in 2025. Still, public health experts are increasingly concerned about the lack of bird flu testing. Rick Bright, the former head of BARDA, has called the U.S. lag in testing “woefully inadequate”– recalling troubling similarities to the ultimately disastrous COVID-19 testing delays. While the CDC currently ranks the risk of a bird flu pandemic as “low”, it is impossible to predict if and when that may change without increased testing. A recent study from Texas suggests that current surveillance may be missing a significant number of cases, indicating that more testing is needed to ensure that the U.S. does not underestimate bird flu infection levels. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Congress authorized additional funding and removed the bureaucratic obstacles to expedite the production of tests and vaccines. One notable initiative, RADx, administered by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), provided funding and regulatory support for private labs developing innovative testing techniques.However, the delay between the initial warning signs of the pandemic and the subsequent action likely cost tens of thousands of lives. Congress should take proactive measures to avoid similar administrative inefficiency and backlog with H5N1. These include providing advance market commitments to manufacturers for testing and using existing tools to streamline testing efforts. The state of testing The coordination of testing for novel pathogens is fragmented and inefficient. This was especially evident during the COVID-19 pandemic, when the CDC rejected the test designed by the World Health Organization’s (WHO) and chose to create its own. As a result, the FDA did not approve tests manufactured by independent labs, leading to a communication breakdown between the two agencies. Consequently, the FDA’ relied on the CDC’s initially faulty COVID-19 test. This is not the first time that testing fragmentation has resulted in delays. A similar scenario occurred during the 2016 Zika epidemic. In 2016, the CDC introduced a complex test kit for multiple diseases–including Zika–which proved less effective than the previous Zika-only test, missing 40 percent of Zika cases. Despite these issues, the CDC mandated its use for a year. In the case of COVID-19, it took nearly two years into the pandemic for the U.S. to develop an abundance of rapid tests. Compared to countries like Germany, the United States only adequately invested in rapid tests in the fall of 2021. The initial flurry of COVID-19 response bills required laboratory testing to be free at the point of service for all Americans, ensuring a stable market for laboratory diagnostics and giving manufacturers the certainty needed to produce millions of test kits. However, rapid tests were not included in this requirement, making it difficult for manufacturers to predict future demand. Consequently, rapid tests remained relatively rare until fall 2021, when the Biden Administration directed more funding to the RADx program and pledged to purchase half a million tests. Many experts have highlighted the troubling similarities between the U.S. government’s response to the current H5N1 outbreak and its mishandling of COVID-19. The U.S. must improve testing coordination to mount an effective response to H5N1. Testing for bird flu is even more fragmented than testing for COVID-19 because this outbreak involves livestock and milk. Different agencies are responsible for viral testing at various stages: The USDA tests live cows, the FDA tests milk products, and the CDC tests humans. This fragmented approach complicates coordination, as positive tests in livestock do not automatically trigger testing for farm workers exposed to those animals.The CDC claims to have distributed 750,000 non-rapid tests to labs nationwide for human testing. State public health agencies can then use these tests on farm workers. However, since March 2024 (when the first human case was discovered) the CDC has reported performing 60 tests on humans in the U.S., detecting 13 human cases of H5N1. States with outbreaks have reported 99 total tests, including those for people exposed to other sick animals, which likely overlap with tests administered by the CDC. Moreover, the CDC tests are limited to people exposed to cattle. This approach does not detect all cases. The University of Texas discovered antibodies against the virus in two out of 14 previously untested workers from just two dairy farms with outbreaks. The CDC has also permitted eight labs to manufacture tests using its design. However, each lab must undergo an FDA approval process to begin manufacturing tests, which could take months or years. Furthermore, the FDA recently announced a final rule requiring more premarket testing, increasing the regulatory barriers to creating new diagnostic tests. Although this rule will not go into effect until 2025, labs are already designing their tests with these new requirements in mind. This process could be significantly expedited if the FDA granted Emergency Use Authorizations (EUA) to these labs, lowering the evidence threshold required for approval, as it did for devices related to COVID-19. Currently, testing is conducted by state public health labs using the CDC’s test. The states send presumptive positive samples to the CDC for confirmation and genetic sequencing. While the 750,000 tests the CDC has distributed are sufficient for the low demand, this could change quickly. During the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, labs performed more than two million tests a day. However, the CDC is not designed to be a high-capacity manufacturer of tests; that role belongs to private labs and manufacturers. Currently, only the CDC has FDA approval to manufacture tests, which means that if states suddenly needed more, there would be significant delays. Rapid tests can help fill the gaps in the current testing strategy because they do not require constant contact with the medical system to be used regularly. The U.S. must begin developing and distributing these rapid tests to understand the severity of our H5N1 outbreak better. Policies to increase testing moving forward The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the agency encompassing the FDA, CDC and NIH, can expedite developing and approving various diagnostic tools. Congress and HHS should urgently consider the following to increase testing for bird flu: Buy and distribute existing rapid influenza tests. During the pandemic, the NIH spent $500 million designing the aforementioned RADx program to fund research into different types of COVID-19 tests, including at-home rapid tests. The program produced combination flu and COVID-19 tests that can distinguish between Influenza A and B(the former being a potential indicator of H5N1 during the summer months). Congress should similarly appropriate money to buy and distribute these tests to farm workers. Issue an Emergency Use Authorization. The HHS Secretary can issue an Emergency Use Authorization for diagnostics to accelerate the testing process. Doing so would enable the FDA to expedite the approval process. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the FDA provided templates for labs to use for their tests, speeding up approval time and lowering the administrative burden on labs. HHS should consider offering similar resources to labs today. Offer advance market commitments to build on the success of RADx to develop new H5N1 tests. With additional congressional funding, NIH could relaunch the RADx program to help labs develop H5N1-specific tests. Congress should offer advance market commitments to ensure manufacturers will be compensated because it is still being determined how many bird flu tests we will ultimately need. Doing so provides the government with enough tests to cover the worst-case scenario of a widespread outbreak while motivating labs to produce them. Despite the delays, the U.S. was eventually able to produce and distribute large quantities of COVID-19 tests by working around the rigid bureaucracy. Those same tools are currently at the disposal of U.S. public health authorities. While BARDA has accelerated vaccine development, we must commit resources to test for H5N1 adequately. To do this, utilizing existing effective diagnostic tools and initiating advance market commitments for testing is critical. Of course, the hope is that these tests will ultimately not be needed. Still, given that scaling up production is expensive and time-consuming, being proactive is critical to ensuring the U.S. is well-equipped if H5N1 ever becomes a more significant threat.

Ⓒ 2024 Dotdash Media, Inc. — All rights reserved Kids' Health Cold & Flu When Is It Too Late to Get a Flu Shot? By Vincent Iannelli, MD Updated on August 07, 2024 Medically reviewed by Daniel Combs, MD Print Close While you usually want to get a flu shot well before flu season gets started, that isn't always possible. With flu shot delays or shortages, your child might not always be able to get a flu shot when you want. Steve Jacobs / Getty Images Late Flu Shots So when is it too late to get vaccinated against the flu? The CDC recommends getting vaccinated early, but they also say, "Getting vaccinated later, however, can still be beneficial and vaccination should continue to be offered throughout the flu season, even into January or later." So it is really never too late to get a flu vaccine. When Should You Get a Flu Shot? While ideally, you should have gotten your flu shot by September or October, that sometimes doesn't happen. Why wait? The early start to a flu season might catch you by surprise so that you simply didn't have time to get your kids their flu vaccine. Others might wait, thinking they didn't need one, but then became concerned about the reports of how bad flu season has been the last few years. Of course, it is always better to get a flu shot much earlier so that you are protected for the full flu season. Finding Flu Shots Because of the flu shot delays and shortages in past years, finding a flu shot, even if you want one, has sometimes been difficult. Increased demands as flu activity increases have a lot of people looking for flu vaccine who might otherwise have skipped getting vaccinated though. That could have meant that your healthcare provider was already out by the time you wanted one. If your own pediatrician does run out of flu shots, you might check with your local health department, hospital, or pharmacies, and find a flu shot wherever you can. For some groups, the flu shot could pose risks. Find out who should not get the flu shot and why. Frequently Asked Questions Should you get a flu shot if you have a cold? If you have a mild cold, it should be okay to get a flu shot. However, it's best to check in with a healthcare provider first, just to be safe. If you have a high fever or feel any more serious symptoms of sickness, you will likely be advised to wait before getting a flu shot. Should you get a flu shot if you've already had the flu? Yes. Even if you've had the flu this year, the flu shot covers different strains, so it can help protect you from getting the flu again. When should you get the flu shot? For the best protection, get it as early in the flu season—ideally by the end of October. However, even if you are late, it's still a good idea to get a flu shot. Flu activity peaks in February and can last as late as May. 3 Sources Verywell Health uses only high-quality sources, including peer-reviewed studies, to support the facts within our articles.

ByTapatrisha Das, Delhi Aug 06, 2024 08:51 PM IST Read this news in brief form Share Via Copy Link From temperature rise to changes in animal habitats, here are a few ways by which global warming can accelerate the rise of flu cases. There has been a surge in the number of flu cases this year. The numbers seem to keep rising. Climate change and global warming are believed to have significant impacts on the health of people. In an interview with HT Lifestyle, Dr Vidhe Sharma, MD, physician, Ruby Hall Clinic, Hinjawadi, pointed out how global warming and the surge in number of flu cases are interconnected by several factors. Climate change and global warming are believed to have significant impacts on the health of people.(Pixabay ) Climate change and seasonal patterns:Global warming alters temperature and precipitation patterns, which can affect the timing and duration of seasons. This can lead to shifts in the timing and intensity of flu seasons, potentially extending or altering when flu viruses are active. This further makes people become more exposed to the disease. Temperature and virus survival:Warmer temperatures can allow some viruses, including influenza viruses, to survive for longer periods outside of hosts. This might increase the likelihood of transmission in certain environments. ALSO READ: Rising temperatures, longer monsoons make dengue constant danger in South Asia; tips to address this evolving threat Human behaviour changes:Changes in climate can also influence human behavior, such as spending more time indoors or changes in migration patterns, which can impact the spread of infectious diseases like the flu. Ecological and animal factors:Climate change affects ecosystems and can lead to changes in animal habitats and behaviors. This can influence the prevalence and transmission of zoonotic diseases (those that spread from animals to humans), some of which may include influenza viruses, and affect human being severely. ALSO READ: Protecting against Zika virus: Zika vs dengue diagnosis challenges and tips for mosquito bite prevention Health impacts and vulnerability:Climate change can exacerbate health vulnerabilities in populations, making them more susceptible to infections like the flu due to stress, malnutrition, or displacement from extreme weather events. “Overall, while the direct link between global warming and flu cases is complex and multifaceted, these factors illustrate how changes in climate can contribute to shifts in disease patterns, including the incidence of influenza,” added Dr Vidhe Sharma.

Experts say it poses a risk for the spread of bird flu.Ben Thorp / WFYI Between July and October states across the country hold their annual state fairs. The events are known for things like Ferris wheels and corn dogs, sculptures made entirely from butter and the biggest pig in the state. But state fairs can also be places where it’s easier to spread disease –– bringing humans and animals from farms across the state into close contact. That’s of particular concern this year, as H5N1 or bird flu infections have been confirmed in dairy cattle in 13 U.S. states for the first time ever. The virus has also infected four dairy workers across Michigan, Texas, and Colorado. But that’s not keeping many fairgoers from lining up in front of the cattle nosing their way out of their barn fences. Mel Ventimiglia stood by several cows with his grandkids inside a barn at the Indiana State Fair in Indianapolis. He said bird flu isn’t even on his radar. “I haven’t heard anybody mention it except for you,” he told Side Effects. “Hopefully, I forget about it pretty quickly.” At another nearby cattle barn, farmer Randy Mason says he follows basic precautions to keep his cattle from getting sick while at the fair, but he’s not particularly worried. “A lot of that in my opinion gets overblown,” he said. “They get one or two cases and then it becomes –– like everything the government does –– it becomes overblown and out of proportion.” But across the country, bird flu infections have been confirmed in nearly 200 herds, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That’s led officials at some state fairs to enact stricter rules to keep the virus from spreading. In Minnesota, which has detected cases of bird flu within its dairy cattle, the state is requiring all cows to have a negative bird flu test before coming to the state fair. That’s not the case in many other states, however, including Indiana, where there hasn’t been confirmed cases of bird flu. “Since we've not had a diagnosis, we've not put those additional measures,” said Bret Marsh, Indiana state veterinarian. He said the state has told farmers to keep an eye out for signs of bird flu in their animals. They have also communicated to farmers the risks of spreading illness when coming to the fair and advised that animals are quarantined for 30 days after being shown –– but without a positive test, Marsh said, the state doesn’t need to put tighter restrictions in place. Why are state fairs a concern? But scientists widely agree that there is not enough testing going on to fully understand which states have cows infected with bird flu. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said states like Indiana don’t have any positive bird flu cases in cattle because they aren’t looking for them. “The assumption should be, this virus is in the state of Indiana, we just haven't found it yet,” he said. “That's what they should be messaging, not ‘Our cows are free.’ That's foolish to believe.” That makes sites like state fairs –– where humans will be coming into contact with different animals –– especially concerning. Scientists worry that the bird flu could mutate to become a human virus if given the opportunity. Currently, the virus seems to only have infected humans coming in direct contact with the udders and equipment used on infected cows, and have resulted in cases of conjunctivitis or pink eye in humans. The broader concern is that the virus could mutate into a respiratory virus which would spread more easily from person to person. And fairs have a history of being places where that spillover –– from animals to humans –– happen. In 2012 a major swine flu outbreak led to over 300 infections in the U.S., with the majority of those associated with exposure at agricultural fairs. And last year, the CDC reported that two people caught swine flu after visiting pig exhibits. Each time an influenza virus jumps into a new host it’s given an opportunity to evolve, potentially becoming one that could easily spread through humans. Experts worry that the risk of H5N1 becoming a human virus could be substantially heightened if the virus makes it to pigs in particular because they are a perfect mixing vessel for viruses from different species. This means that the different viruses can exchange genetic material and learn from one another, potentially mutating and becoming more adept at infecting humans. “One of the things that people bring up so much about Covid-19 are the animal markets in China, where you have multiple different animals and different species interacting with each other,” Adalja said. “Similar things happen at state fairs in the United States. That's not really any different.” Andrew Bowman, professor of veterinary preventive medicine at the Ohio State University, agrees that the co-mingling of animals and people at state fairs poses a risk. “We've thought about new pandemic viruses arising from Southeast Asian live animal markets. And we think, ‘Oh, we would never do that in the U.S.’ Well, fairs kind of mimic that,” he said. The risk to humans is still low Still, experts like Bowman say that isn’t a reason to miss out on the state fair altogether. “I'm still going to the fair, and my family is still going to the fair. I had a milkshake when I was there,” Bowman said. He added that at-risk populations, such as the immunocompromised, should consider avoiding the cattle barn this year. “You know, exercise caution and really kind of think about which contacts [you] need to have,” Bowman said. “Can I enjoy the animal exhibits, maybe from a little further distance, and not get right in the middle of it?” The CDC issued guidance in June for state fairs to reduce the spread of bird flu, including a prohibition on dumping milk on the ground, because raw milk from infected cattle is likely to carry live virus. The guidance also advises keeping cows from different herds apart, and encourages visitors to wash their hands before leaving a barn. Earlier this year the U.S. Department of Agriculture instituted a rule requiring cows test negative for the virus before crossing state lines. Still, the risk to humans from the bird flu virus remains low, according to the CDC’s assessment. Side Effects Public Media is a health reporting collaboration based at WFYI in Indianapolis.

These critical vaccines could take a year or more to develop and deploy, with late-stage testing expected in 2025. Still, public health experts are increasingly concerned about the lack of bird flu testing. Rick Bright, the former head of BARDA, has called the U.S. lag in testing “woefully inadequate”– recalling troubling similarities to the ultimately disastrous COVID-19 testing delays. While the CDC currently ranks the risk of a bird flu pandemic as “low”, it is impossible to predict if and when that may change without increased testing. A recent study from Texas suggests that current surveillance may be missing a significant number of cases, indicating that more testing is needed to ensure that the U.S. does not underestimate bird flu infection levels. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Congress authorized additional funding and removed the bureaucratic obstacles to expedite the production of tests and vaccines. One notable initiative, RADx, administered by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), provided funding and regulatory support for private labs developing innovative testing techniques.However, the delay between the initial warning signs of the pandemic and the subsequent action likely cost tens of thousands of lives. Congress should take proactive measures to avoid similar administrative inefficiency and backlog with H5N1. These include providing advance market commitments to manufacturers for testing and using existing tools to streamline testing efforts. The state of testing The coordination of testing for novel pathogens is fragmented and inefficient. This was especially evident during the COVID-19 pandemic, when the CDC rejected the test designed by the World Health Organization’s (WHO) and chose to create its own. As a result, the FDA did not approve tests manufactured by independent labs, leading to a communication breakdown between the two agencies. Consequently, the FDA’ relied on the CDC’s initially faulty COVID-19 test. This is not the first time that testing fragmentation has resulted in delays. A similar scenario occurred during the 2016 Zika epidemic. In 2016, the CDC introduced a complex test kit for multiple diseases–including Zika–which proved less effective than the previous Zika-only test, missing 40 percent of Zika cases. Despite these issues, the CDC mandated its use for a year. In the case of COVID-19, it took nearly two years into the pandemic for the U.S. to develop an abundance of rapid tests. Compared to countries like Germany, the United States only adequately invested in rapid tests in the fall of 2021. The initial flurry of COVID-19 response bills required laboratory testing to be free at the point of service for all Americans, ensuring a stable market for laboratory diagnostics and giving manufacturers the certainty needed to produce millions of test kits. However, rapid tests were not included in this requirement, making it difficult for manufacturers to predict future demand. Consequently, rapid tests remained relatively rare until fall 2021, when the Biden Administration directed more funding to the RADx program and pledged to purchase half a million tests. Many experts have highlighted the troubling similarities between the U.S. government’s response to the current H5N1 outbreak and its mishandling of COVID-19. The U.S. must improve testing coordination to mount an effective response to H5N1. Testing for bird flu is even more fragmented than testing for COVID-19 because this outbreak involves livestock and milk. Different agencies are responsible for viral testing at various stages: The USDA tests live cows, the FDA tests milk products, and the CDC tests humans. This fragmented approach complicates coordination, as positive tests in livestock do not automatically trigger testing for farm workers exposed to those animals.The CDC claims to have distributed 750,000 non-rapid tests to labs nationwide for human testing. State public health agencies can then use these tests on farm workers. However, since March 2024 (when the first human case was discovered) the CDC has reported performing 60 tests on humans in the U.S., detecting 13 human cases of H5N1. States with outbreaks have reported 99 total tests, including those for people exposed to other sick animals, which likely overlap with tests administered by the CDC. Moreover, the CDC tests are limited to people exposed to cattle. This approach does not detect all cases. The University of Texas discovered antibodies against the virus in two out of 14 previously untested workers from just two dairy farms with outbreaks. The CDC has also permitted eight labs to manufacture tests using its design. However, each lab must undergo an FDA approval process to begin manufacturing tests, which could take months or years. Furthermore, the FDA recently announced a final rule requiring more premarket testing, increasing the regulatory barriers to creating new diagnostic tests. Although this rule will not go into effect until 2025, labs are already designing their tests with these new requirements in mind. This process could be significantly expedited if the FDA granted Emergency Use Authorizations (EUA) to these labs, lowering the evidence threshold required for approval, as it did for devices related to COVID-19. Currently, testing is conducted by state public health labs using the CDC’s test. The states send presumptive positive samples to the CDC for confirmation and genetic sequencing. While the 750,000 tests the CDC has distributed are sufficient for the low demand, this could change quickly. During the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, labs performed more than two million tests a day. However, the CDC is not designed to be a high-capacity manufacturer of tests; that role belongs to private labs and manufacturers. Currently, only the CDC has FDA approval to manufacture tests, which means that if states suddenly needed more, there would be significant delays. Rapid tests can help fill the gaps in the current testing strategy because they do not require constant contact with the medical system to be used regularly. The U.S. must begin developing and distributing these rapid tests to understand the severity of our H5N1 outbreak better. Policies to increase testing moving forward The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the agency encompassing the FDA, CDC and NIH, can expedite developing and approving various diagnostic tools. Congress and HHS should urgently consider the following to increase testing for bird flu: Buy and distribute existing rapid influenza tests. During the pandemic, the NIH spent $500 million designing the aforementioned RADx program to fund research into different types of COVID-19 tests, including at-home rapid tests. The program produced combination flu and COVID-19 tests that can distinguish between Influenza A and B(the former being a potential indicator of H5N1 during the summer months). Congress should similarly appropriate money to buy and distribute these tests to farm workers. Issue an Emergency Use Authorization. The HHS Secretary can issue an Emergency Use Authorization for diagnostics to accelerate the testing process. Doing so would enable the FDA to expedite the approval process. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the FDA provided templates for labs to use for their tests, speeding up approval time and lowering the administrative burden on labs. HHS should consider offering similar resources to labs today. Offer advance market commitments to build on the success of RADx to develop new H5N1 tests. With additional congressional funding, NIH could relaunch the RADx program to help labs develop H5N1-specific tests. Congress should offer advance market commitments to ensure manufacturers will be compensated because it is still being determined how many bird flu tests we will ultimately need. Doing so provides the government with enough tests to cover the worst-case scenario of a widespread outbreak while motivating labs to produce them. Despite the delays, the U.S. was eventually able to produce and distribute large quantities of COVID-19 tests by working around the rigid bureaucracy. Those same tools are currently at the disposal of U.S. public health authorities. While BARDA has accelerated vaccine development, we must commit resources to test for H5N1 adequately. To do this, utilizing existing effective diagnostic tools and initiating advance market commitments for testing is critical. Of course, the hope is that these tests will ultimately not be needed. Still, given that scaling up production is expensive and time-consuming, being proactive is critical to ensuring the U.S. is well-equipped if H5N1 ever becomes a more significant threat.

In back-to-back papers in Nature Communications, the team — from the lab of Navin Varadarajan, M.D. Anderson Professor of William A. Brookshire Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering - reports the development and validation of NanoSTING, a nasal spray, as a broad-spectrum immune activator for controlling infection against multiple respiratory viruses; and the development of NanoSTING-SN, a pan-coronavirus nasal vaccine, that can protect against infection and disease by all members of the coronavirus family. NanoSTING Therapeutic’s Highlights NanoSTING, a nasal spray, can prevent multiple respiratory viruses by activating the immune system and preventing infection from viruses. It can also protect against SARS-CoV-2 reinfection. A single intranasal dose of the NanoSTING has proven effective against strains of SARS-CoV-2 and the flu virus. NanoSTING is complementary to vaccines and enables cells to be in a heightened state of alert to prevent attack from respiratory viruses. NanoSTING-NS Pan-coronavirus Vaccine’s Highlights UH researchers have developed NanoSTING-SN, a nasal vaccine that prevents transmission to the unvaccinated and fights multiple COVID variants. NanoSTING-SN provides the exciting potential towards a universal coronavirus vaccine and may end the cycle of onward transmission and viral evolution in immunocompromised people. Intramuscular vaccines prevent disease but are less efficient in preventing infections. NanoSTING-SN can provide improved protection against transmission for COVID variants and related sarbecoviruses. NanoSTING NanoSTING is a special formula that uses tiny fat droplets to deliver an immune-boosting ingredient called cGAMP. This formula helps the body's cells stay on high alert to prevent attack from respiratory viruses. “Using multiple models, the team demonstrated that a single treatment with NanoSTING not only protects against pathogenic strains of SARS-CoV-2 but also prevents transmission of highly transmissible variants like the Omicron variants,” reports Varadarajan. “Delivery of NanoSTING to the nose ensures that the immune system is activated in the nasal compartment and this in turn prevents infection from viruses.” Navin Varadarajan, M.D. Anderson Professor of William A. Brookshire Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, is fighting the flu and coronavirus - professionally - in his lab! As the recent COVID19 pandemic illustrated, the development of off-the-shelf treatments that counteract respiratory viruses is a largely unsolved problem with a huge impact on human lives. “Our results showed that intranasal delivery of NanoSTING, is capable of eliciting beneficial type I and type III interferon responses that are associated with immune protection and antiviral benefit,” reports first author and postdoctoral associate, Ankita Leekha. The authors further show that NanoSTING can protect against both Tamiflu sensitive and resistant strains of influenza, underscoring its potential as a broad-spectrum therapeutic. “The ability to activate the innate immune system presents an attractive route to armoring humans against multiple respiratory viruses, viral variants and also minimizing transmission to vulnerable people,” said Leekha. “The advantage of NanoSTING is that only one dose is required unlike the antivirals like Tamiflu that require 10 doses.” The mechanism of action of NanoSTING is complementary to vaccines, monoclonal antibodies and antivirals, the authors noted. Nano STING-SN Despite the successful implementation of multiple vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, these vaccines need constant updates due to viral evolution, plus the current generation of vaccines only offers limited protection against transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Enter NanoSTING-SN, a multi-antigen, intranasal vaccine, that eliminates virus replication in both the lungs and the nostrils and has the ability to protect against multiple coronaviruses and variants. “Using multiple preclinical models, the team demonstrated that the vaccine candidate protects the primary host from disease when challenged with highly pathogenic variants. Significantly, the vaccine also prevents transmission of highly transmissible variants like the Omicron variants to vaccine-naïve hosts,” reports Varadarajan. The authors further show that the nasal vaccine was 100% effective at preventing transmission of the Omicron VOCs to unvaccinated hosts. “The ability to protect against multiple coronaviruses and variants provides the exciting potential towards a universal coronavirus vaccine,” said Leekha. “The ability to prevent infections and transmission might finally end this cycle of onward transmission and viral evolution in immunocompromised people.” The research was conducted by a collaborative team at UH including Xinli Liu, College of Pharmacy and Vallabh E. Das, College of Optometry along with Brett L. Hurst of Utah State University and consultation from AuraVax Therapeutics, a spinoff from Varadarajan’s Single Cell Lab at UH, which is developing NanoSTING. Funding for the studies was provided by NIH (R01GM143243), Owens Foundation, and AuraVax Therapeutics.

Research team members include (from left) Professor Kelvin To Kai-wang, Dr Pauline Yeung Pui-ning, Dr Desmond Yap Yat-hin, Dr Simon Sin Wai-ching, and Dr Jasper Chan Fuk-woo. HKUMed finds critically ill influenza patients face double the risk of acute kidney injury than COVID-19 patients Hide caption Show caption Researchers at the LKS Faculty of Medicine, the University of Hong Kong (HKUMed) revealed that critically ill patients with influenza A have a significantly higher risk of developing acute kidney injury (AKI) than those with COVID-19. The findings, published in eClinical Medicine (link to the publication), highlight the important differences in the impact of these two respiratory viruses on kidney health. The study, which analysed data from a Hong Kong-wide cohort, found that influenza patients had a 49% higher risk of developing AKI than those with COVID-19. The influenza group also had a 43% higher risk of developing stage 3 AKI and a 48% increased requirement for acute dialysis. These findings are in stark contrast to earlier reports that suggested a higher risk of AKI and more severe renal impairment among COVID-19 patients,’ said Dr Desmond Yap Yat-hin, Associate Professor from the Department of Medicine, School of Clinical Medicine, HKUMed, who led the research. ‘Our study sheds new light on the evolving landscape of COVID-19 and its impact on renal health.’ Background The SARS-CoV-2 virus and the influenza A virus are common viruses that cause upper and lower respiratory tract infections. Both viruses can also cause AKI, but the comparative risks of AKI in patients severely ill with COVID-19 and influenza A had not previously been examined. Patients who become critically ill after acquiring one of these respiratory viral infections place a significant burden on society, especially if they develop multiple organ failure, which requires intensive or long-term organ support. This study compared the incidence and severity of AKI in critically ill patients with COVID-19 and influenza A in Hong Kong, providing valuable insights into the extra-respiratory complications associated with these viral infections. Research methods and findings Investigators from the Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, the Critical Care Medicine Unit and the Department of Microbiology, School of Clinical Medicine of HKUMed collaborated to conduct a retrospective cohort study using data from the Hospital Authority’s electronic health records. The research team analysed data from 4,328 patients admitted to the intensive care units (ICUs) of 15 public hospitals in Hong Kong between January 2013 and April 2023, of whom 2,787 (64.4%) had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 1,541 (35.6%) had tested positive for influenza A. The results showed that 1,053 (37.8%) COVID-19 patients developed AKI during their ICU stay, compared to 828 (53.7%) influenza A patients. After adjusting for confounding factors, the risk of AKI in patients with influenza A was double that of COVID-19 patients. The risk of severe AKI and prolonged AKI were also significantly higher in patients with influenza A. Significance of the research The research team provided a few plausible explanations for the higher risk of AKI in influenza A patients. First, the influenza virus may be more virulent or damaging to the kidneys than the COVID-19 virus. Second and possibly more importantly, the significantly higher vaccination rates among the local population during the COVID-19 pandemic may have provided some protection against the development of kidney problems. Population statistics show that the local COVID-19 vaccination rate was over 70% for adults aged 20 to 59, and over 60% for adults aged 60 to 69. In contrast, the annual influenza vaccination rate was only 10–20% for persons aged 50 to 64, and less than 50% for those aged 65 or above. It remains to be investigated whether improving influenza vaccination uptake during the seasonal pandemic can lower the risk of systemic organ injury. Dr Desmond Yap Yat-hin emphasised, ‘This study highlights the need for continued vigilance and prevention when it comes to severe respiratory viral infections. Despite the lower risk of kidney complications in COVID-19 patients, it is important that the burden of concurrent organ failure complicating respiratory viral infections, such as the higher disease-attributable risk of AKI associated with influenza, should not be overlooked and vaccinations should be strongly advocated for all at-risk individuals.’ About the research team The research was led by Dr Desmond Yap Yat-hin, Clinical Associate Professor, Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, School of Clinical Medicine, HKUMed. Other team members from HKUMed School of Clinical Medicine, include April Ip See-wai, Dr Simon Sin Wai-ching and Dr Pauline Yeung Pui-ning from Critical Care Medicine Unit; Dr Andrew Ng Kei-yan from Department of Medicine; and Dr Jasper Chan Fuk-woo, Professor Kelvin To Kai-wang from Department of Microbiology.

With 20 confirmed cases and several hospitalizations, including ICU admissions, reported in the last 15 days, medical professionals are urging the public to remain vigilant and adopt preventive measures. The onset of the monsoon season and the beginning of the academic year have created an environment conducive to the spread of viral infections, with both adults and children being affected. According to Dr. Vivek Anand Padegal, Director of Pulmonology at Fortis Hospital on Bannerghatta Road, this increase in respiratory illnesses is notable across all age groups. He also suggests that the actual number of cases might be much higher due to undiagnosed instances. Monsoon’s Role in Virus Transmission As per Bangalore Mirror, Dr. Srikanta JT, a Consultant in Pediatric Interventional Pulmonology at Aster CMI Hospital, explains that while the monsoon season doesn’t directly cause illness, it does facilitate conditions favorable for viruses to replicate and spread. “The flu primarily spreads through respiratory droplets from coughing or sneezing, and contaminated surfaces can act as fomites, aiding in the transmission of infection,” said Dr. Srikanta, quoted by Bangalore Mirror. He also highlights a significant rise in influenza cases among children, with around 25 cases reported in the last two weeks, some requiring hospitalization. “Symptoms such as fever, chills, body aches, dry cough, headache, eye pain, sore throat, and stuffy nose are common indicators of influenza,” he noted. “With the new school year, the close interaction among children provides an ideal setting for viruses to propagate, leading to a marked increase in respiratory viral infections, predominantly influenza.” Impact on Different Age GroupsAd Dr. Padegal points out that while all age groups are being affected, the elderly are particularly susceptible, with several requiring intensive care and ventilation. “Symptoms include fever, cough, body pain, and sore throat, with some patients developing pneumonia. Early detection and treatment with antiviral medications are essential for a quick recovery, typically within four to five days. Vaccination remains a crucial preventive measure,” he emphasized, as quoted by Bangalore Mirror. Preventive Measures and Recommendations Both Dr. Srikanta and Dr. Padegal stress the importance of vaccination as a vital tool in mitigating the severity of influenza. They advise individuals who are sick to stay home from work or school to prevent the spread of the virus. Additionally, maintaining good hygiene practices, such as frequent handwashing, following cough etiquette, and disinfecting surfaces, is essential. Dr. Srikanta also advises that while the flu is often self-limiting and can be managed with symptomatic treatment at home, individuals should seek emergency medical attention if they experience severe symptoms such as chest tightness, difficulty breathing, chest pain, dizziness, severe muscle pains, or exacerbation of underlying health conditions like diabetes, asthma, or seizures. In summary, as Bengaluru faces this early influenza outbreak, health professionals are urging the public to remain cautious, prioritize vaccination, and adhere to recommended hygiene practices to reduce the spread of the virus and protect vulnerable populations.

(Unsplash). Agriculture Victoria is continuing to respond to the detection of high-pathogenicity avian influenza at eight poultry farms in the state. No new infected properties have been identified since June 24. State government staff have completed more than 5,000 surveillance activities, including property visits, phone calls and dead bird collections, and have tested over 16,300 samples. Agriculture Victoria staff are continuing to work with affected properties, supporting decontamination and egg and litter disposal activities. A comprehensive surveillance program of all of the commercial poultry farms in the area is also underway. To manage the affected areas, a housing requirement is also in place, meaning all birds in the restricted area or control area near the infected properties must remain in their enclosures, to prevent contact with wild birds. State chief veterinary officer Dr Graeme Cooke said that bird owners provide essential support in preventing further outbreaks. “We appreciate that in these areas it’s not always easy to have your birds housed and we thank bird owners for their essential support to prevent the spread of this disease, as the risk of the disease remains,” Dr Graeme Cooke said. “I’d also like to acknowledge the poultry industry for their ongoing assistance as we work to eradicate avian influenza from Victoria,” he said. Infected properties continue to be decontaminated and the risk of infection removed, as Agriculture Victoria works towards achieving freedom of avian influenza for Victoria’s poultry industry. Agriculture Victoria has urged poultry farmers, backyard flock and bird owners to report any cases of unexplained bird deaths to the VicEmergency Hotline on 1800 226 226. While cases among humans in direct contact with animals infected with highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses are possible, the current risk to the public remains low. If you have had contact with birds on an affected property and you are experiencing cold or flu symptoms, call your doctor or the Department of Health. Details: agriculture.vic.gov.au/avianinfluenza.

Six patients recovered and were discharged from the hospital, while others are still recovering. Health teams are conducting tests to curb the spread. Swine flu spreads through respiratory droplets and contaminated surfaces, marked by symptoms like fever, cough, and body aches. A total of 11 cases of swine flu has triggered concern in Madhya Pradesh's Jabalpur district. In order to stop the spread of the infection and to contain it, health department teams are conducting tests in various areas. The cases came to light between July 11 and August 6, Health Department Joint Director Dr Sanjay Mishra told PTI. Six out of 11 patients were discharged from a private hospital after recovery while the remaining patients were recovering, he said.Swine flu, also known as H1N1 influenza, is a respiratory disease caused by the H1N1 virus strain. Originally, it was a virus that infected pigs, but it has since mutated to infect humans, leading to widespread outbreaks.In June 2023, a fatal human case of H1N1 was reported in Parana, Brazil. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), "The patient was a 42-year-old woman with underlying medical conditions who lived near a swine farm. She developed fever, headache, sore throat, and abdominal pain on 1 May 2023 and was hospitalized on 3 May with a severe acute respiratory infection. On 4 May, the patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and she passed away on 5 May."Swine Flu in IndiaThe first documented case of H1N1 was in May 2009. In 2015, India witnessed a massive swine flu outbreak. Gujarat and Rajasthan were worst affected. The swine flu had claimed more than 2,000 lives in the country, as per reports.Swine flu spreads primarily through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or be inhaled into the lungs. It can also spread by touching surfaces contaminated with the virus and then touching the face, especially the mouth, nose, or eyes. Crowded places, such as schools and public transportation, can facilitate the rapid spread of the virus.Key symptomsThe symptoms of swine flu are similar to those of regular seasonal flu and can range from mild to severe. They typically include fever, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, body aches, headache, chills, and fatigue.Some people may experience diarrhea and vomiting. Severe cases can lead to pneumonia, respiratory failure, and even death, particularly in vulnerable populations such as the elderly, young children, pregnant women, and individuals with pre-existing health conditions.How to stay safe?Staying safe from swine flu involves several proactive measures:Good hygiene: Practice regular handwashing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after coughing, sneezing, or touching potentially contaminated surfaces. Use alcohol-based hand sanitizers when soap and water are not available.Avoid close contact: Try to avoid close contact with people who are sick. If you are sick, stay home from work or school to prevent spreading the virus to others.Cover your cough: Always cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your elbow when you cough or sneeze.

Influenza is a virus that spreads in two types. Epidemics are present,” said Consultant Pediatric Chest Physician, Dr. Anuradha Kodippili. Moreover, she explained that coughs and colds play a main role and that the current influenza is a respiratory virus that’s spreading. Furthermore, she explained that in addition to the typical symptoms like fever, runny /congested nose, cough, and body aches seen in influenza, some children, especially known wheezers present with exacerbation of wheezing. Rise in wheezing cases among children “There is an increase in wheezing among children. Children are affected by wheezing during this infection. It has been noticed that wheezing is a symptom of the current influenza spread,” said Dr. Kodippili. “The number of cases that we have detected is much less than the actual status as we don’t test every child present with coughs and colds for influenza,” underscored Dr. Kodippili. However, it was said that there is no requirement to test all the children and only those who are very unwell and get admitted to the hospital or children who fall into high-risk categories are taken through a checkup. Dr. Kodippili stated that the influenza virus is spread through the respiratory droplets. When a person with influenza coughs and sneezes the virus spreads through respiratory droplets, therefore it is an air-borne virus. “The number of children who attend the OPD (Out Patient Department) with cough and cold symptoms has increased,” said Dr. Kodippili. Moreover, she mentioned that one can get infected by touching a surface contaminated with the respiratory secretions of an infected person and then touching the nose or mouth. “It is important to get your child examined by a doctor when they are having flu symptoms. Then the doctors would decide on testing for influenza. Most of the children with flu recover without complications; just like during a viral cold,” said Dr. Kodippili. They only need supportive care with paracetamol, fluids and symptomatic treatment. Selected on their conditions, children will be treated with antiviral treatment which is available both at the government and private sectors. She mentioned that hand hygiene and wearing a mask would prevent the infection from spreading the virus. Parents must keep their children, especially preschoolers, at home when they are unwell and have flu symptoms. Moreover, Dr. Kodippili advised parents to not smoke in the presence of kids as wheezing cases rise. She cited that a notable increase can be seen in cases of wheezing among pediatric patients. What happens in wheezing? Why do some children wheeze with influenza? She explained the changes that take place in the respiratory tract when one gets affected by wheezing. This condition is a common symptom with many chest complications in children; including asthma. It isn’t a problem of the lungs of children. “There is a tubing system in the respiratory tract. The tubing system flows from the nose to the lungs. They are connected to a tube called a windpipe. It divides into two and reaches the two lungs. It branches into several other tiny branches. At the end of each tube, there’s a balloon-like structure (Alveolar). Those branches are sensitive and will be narrowed if the child is infected by wheezing,” explained Dr. Kodippili. When these small airways get narrowed, the child finds it difficult to exhale. “This can happen with influenza or any viral/bacterial infection. Wheezing following influenza or viral chest infections can last a few weeks to months,” explained Dr. Kodippili Originating of the musical sound in the lungs was explained by the doctor where balloons are inflated and when squeezed by the neck, the airflow is narrowed; as a result, a musical sound is produced. She added that wheezing is more common among children than adults, as these tiny tubes are narrower in comparison to adults. Adult tubes are rigid, but children are more flexible. Therefore, children are easily infected by wheezing. Dr.Kodippili explained that for children who have Asthma, sometimes the fur allergies from pets at home are a positive factor in wheezing. Therefore, one should avoid contact with those. “Animal fur, pollen, firewood smoke, mosquito coil smoke industrial dust and passive smoking should be avoided,” said Dr. Kodippili Do you have these symptoms? As viral influenza has increased wheezing among children, Dr. Kodippili explained the specific symptoms that one would face during wheezing. Dry cough, a musical Sound heard when breathing, difficulty in breathing/ shortness of breath, and chest tightness among the older children. Recurrent wheezing in children develop into Asthma. A child associated with asthma can possess the symptoms of wheezing. Asthma is a fatal disease and if it isn’t properly treated, the child could face death. Symptoms of Asthma According to Dr.Kodippili, for a child to get a predisposition to Asthma to have a family history of Asthma in an immediate family member. Or other diseases associated with the Asthma family, such as Eczeema, as there is a high chance for predisposition to Asthma. She stated that if the child has food and drug allergies it could be called as a symptom of Asthma. Also, wheezing can occur at a particular time of the day. It will increase with exposure to different environments such as smoking, dust, or pollen. Dr. Kodippili declared that there is no particular test to diagnose Asthma. It takes around 5 years to be diagnosed as an Asthma patient. Just because a child has the symptoms for a while does not make the child labeled as an Asthma patient. Prevention To the question raised on the prevention techniques, she advised to avoid what triggers Wheezing. The use of inhalers if diagnosed in the doctor’s prescribed way would help the patient to overcome wheezing sooner. “It is difficult to prevent wheezing associated with viral infections/ influenza as cross infections are very common among children,” said Dr. Kodippili. She stated that children less than 5 years old who are diagnosed with Asthma are called preschool wheezers. These children have respiratory/chest infections or viral-induced wheezing Some will develop Asthma after the period and some will completely recover. Children living in polluted areas are more exposed to wheezing; especially children from upcountry and the countryside. Treatments for wheezing “Treatments for wheezing are available in almost all the government and private hospitals. Since the management of wheezing doesn’t need expensive medications (nebulizes), it is readily available,” underscored Dr. Kodippili. Furthermore, diving into the depth of the treatments, she explained about two types of treatments done to manage wheezing. Acute management of wheezing focuses on providing immediate relief from symptoms controlling symptoms and improving the quality of life. Long-term Management of wheezing is aimed at controlling chronic conditions, preventing symptoms, and improving the quality of life. The specific approach depends on the underlying cause, such as asthma, allergies, or other respiratory conditions. When patient with Asthma is diagnosed he/she will be instructed to use inhalers. “Certain patients don’t adhere to the necessary treatments provided by the doctors, hence they need ICU care and necessary ventilations,” she mentioned. Challenges There are certain challenges faced by doctors and patients such as a lack of knowledge of patients about Inhaler techniques. They are also not specifically trained. It is hard to eliminate environmental pollution to avoid wheezing. During preschool wheezing, it is hard to treat the patient (children) as they don’t understand the purpose of treatment. (Less than 2/3 years) Viral infections are common as children live without isolation once they are infected with the viral infection spreading with wheezing. She added that there aren’t many campaigns to make the public aware of childhood wheezing and Asthma. As we face an increasing number of children affected by respiratory issues, can we afford to ignore the critical need for awareness and prevention measures?

He said one of the key differences between the two is the speed of onset.“Often with a cold, it’ll come on gradually over a couple of days, you’ll get this slight sore throat, a bit of a cough, a runny nose, those sort of cluster of symptoms start to happen.“Often what people describe with the influenza is they’ll be okay in the morning. In the afternoon, very suddenly, over a few hours, they’ll get a very severe, often muscle ache, headache, dry cough and temperature and start to feel miserable.”He said that he often sees patients who say they don’t need the flu vaccine because they’ve never had it.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.“Often they haven’t actually experienced a full-blown influenza infection. And once you’ve had it, you don’t want it again. It can go on for seven to 14 days. It can really lay you low down in bed. You can’t do much. You feel miserable. It’s really is full-on, so it is not something you really want to catch.”Telfar-Barnard said it may seem that people are sicker than usual this year, but the period of closed borders during 2020 and 2021 may have made New Zealanders mistake that insular situation for a new normal.“It is normal to have peaks in the winter and respiratory illness, but we have seen a particularly sharp rise. Rather than kind of creeping up slowly, it’s kind of come on all at once and that, that may be part of the shock that we’re experiencing.”She said the closed borders meant there were several years where New Zealanders didn’t build up immunity, but people’s immune systems are not generally weaker because of it.“Normally when, if you catch flu, if you maybe get a mild dose or a severe dose, then that gives you some immunity for the next few years and then you become a bit more susceptible again.“So none of us had flu for those two years and so that susceptibility built up, but it’s, but our immune systems are still functioning just as well as they were before.”Listen to the full episode to the full episode for more on what illnesses are spreading this winter, how severe this spike is putting on our health system, and what we can do to try and stay healthy.The Front Page is a daily news podcast from the New Zealand Herald, available to listen to every weekday from 5am.

Image Credit: Shutterstock. DUBAI: The new flu vaccine is out and it’s time you take it, doctors advise. Available at most clinics and hospitals, the 2024-25 vaccine can be availed at a cost. Get exclusive content with Gulf News WhatsApp channel Dr Jyothish George, Director of Vaccine Services at the Prime Healthcare Group, told Gulf News: “It is recommended to take the flu vaccine every year as the new flu virus strains are added into the vaccines and updated yearly. It protects them from Influenza Virus A and B infections.” He said Prime is currently offering the vaccine made by three different manufacturers, from which residents can choose. Dr Jyothish George With schools set to reopen shortly, he said the vaccines are highly recommended for children. “Children aged six months to 17 years of age require a 0.5ml dose. Children less than nine years of age, who have not previously been vaccinated with a seasonal influenza vaccine, also need a second dose of 0.5ml that should be given after an interval of at least four weeks,” he said, adding that the efficiacy of the vaccine has not yet been established in infants less than six months of age. Why take the vaccine? Dr. Grace Fabrizia Graziani, Specialist Family Medicine, Aster Royal Clinic, Arabian Ranches, said, “The flu is a formidable adversary, constantly evolving to evade our immune defenses. This is why receiving an annual flu vaccine is crucial. Influenza viruses are notorious for their ability to mutate rapidly. These changes, known as antigenic drift, create new strains of the virus each year. As a result, the immunity developed from previous infections or vaccinations may not protect against the newly circulating strains. The annual flu vaccine is meticulously formulated to target the most likely influenza viruses circulating in the season." Dr. Grace Fabrizia Graziani She said, "By getting vaccinated, you’re equipping your immune system with the tools it needs to recognise and fight off these viruses. Protecting yourself from the flu isn’t solely about your well-being. It’s a community effort. When vaccination rates are high, the spread of the flu is significantly reduced, safeguarding vulnerable populations such as infants, the elderly, and those with chronic health conditions.” Dr Grace said, “The 2024-25 flu vaccine has been updated with a new influenza A (H3N2) virus compared to the previous year’s vaccine. This is done to ensure the vaccine provides the best possible protection against the circulating strains globally.” According to her, “While a flu vaccine not the perfect shield, it significantly reduces risk of getting the flu. Studies have shown that the flu vaccine can lower the risk of flu illness by between 40-60 per cent during seasons when the vaccine closely matches circulating flu viruses.” Difference between Influenza A & B Influenza A and B are the two main types of influenza that routinely spread in humans and cause seasonal flu epidemics. Influenza A viruses are more harmful as they can cause severe disease. They are foiund in birds and can be transmitted to humans, causing possibly devastating outbreaks. Influenza B infects only humans and mutates more slowly than Influenza A. Both influenza A and influenza B are very contagious. Treatment for both is the same and there is no medication that can kill the virus. So care is focused around relieving symptoms until the body clears the virus naturally. Antiviral medications may only decrease the amount of time that the patient is unwell. She said several factors influence how well the flu vaccine works. When the vaccine closely matches the viruses causing illness, it’s more effective; Individual factors like age, overall health and immune system strength can also affect how well the vaccine offers protection. Dr George said the symptoms of flu include fever, headaches, body ache, sore throat, cough and fatigue. Treatment includes administering antiviral drugs, paracetemol and cough syrups, with the patient being advised to take lots of rest and also ensure fluid intake, Dr Grace cautioned that many common illnesses share similar symptoms with the flu, making it easy to underestimate the severity of the viral infection. “While a cold may cause mild discomfort, the flu often hits hard with high fever, extreme fatigue and body aches that can confine you to bed for days,” she added.

Receiving the flu shot is essential, as it not only safeguards students from illness but also plays a vital role in preventing the spread of the virus to others. The flu virus, which typically circulates from September to April, increases the risk of contracting various mild to chronic respiratory illnesses from different strains. Common and easily contagious flu Dr Hanan Elmorshedi, Specialist Pediatrics, Burjeel Day Surgery Center, Al Dhafra, emphasised the importance of these jabs. Stay up to date with the latest news.

By getting vaccinated, students will be protected against the influenza virus, reducing their risk of illnesses and helping prevent the spread of the virus among peers,” she added. After school reopening, students usually experience respiratory issues, including the common cold, pharyngitis, and tonsillitis. “Influenza (flu) is also prevalent during the time and can cause more severe symptoms. Other frequent concerns include bronchitis, a persistent cough, and asthma exacerbations. Catching a cold or developing respiratory infections can trigger asthma attacks, particularly in children with pre-existing conditions,” added Elmorshedi. Dr Hanan Elmorshedi The flu vaccine is known to reduce the risk of contracting the illness by more than 50 per cent, which can help prevent severe complications. Complications are particularly reported in infants under five years old, older adults aged 60 and above, and individuals with high-risk medical conditions such as asthma, chronic lung diseases, heart disease, diabetes, chronic liver and kidney disorders, blood disorders, neurological conditions, weakened immune systems, and severe obesity. Missing school Dr Noha Mohamed Ali Kharie, Consultant Pediatrics at Zulekha Hospital Sharjah, said, “One major concern for parents as they prepare to send their kids back to school is the risk of common illnesses that children can easily catch. Not only do you hate to see them sick, but they often have to miss school, which means you may have to miss work to care for them. Besides, there’s the risk that the illness may spread to the rest of the family, including you. Some of these illnesses can be prevented by vaccines.” Healthcare professionals explained that the gradual onset of the winter season also brings with it many communicable viral diseases. Dr Noha Mohamed Ali Kharie Picking up virus after travel Dr Arun Shikaripur, Specialist Pediatrician, International Modern Hospital Dubai said, “Though the school reopening is a fun time for most children it has its own disadvantages. Some children who would have visited their home countries will come back with illnesses, which can be transmitted easily to the healthy children.” The vaccine typically provides immunity against the flu within a couple of weeks of receiving the shot, and it protects against Influenza A H1N1, Influenza B, and H3N2. Getting vaccinated on time and following appropriate precautions also helps prevent the spread of the flu within the community. “The vaccine must be taken at least three weeks before the onset of the Influenza season, as this gives time for the antibodies to reach the protective levels in the body,” he added. Dr Arun Shikaripur Aside from flu shots, doctors emphasise that parents should ensure their 5-year-old receives the mandatory DHA vaccines, including the DPT and varicella vaccines, before returning to school after the holidays. Shikaripur said, “There are many optional vaccines that parents should be aware of, like the hepatitis A vaccine, Typhoid vaccine, and meningococcal vaccine, which are very safe and useful vaccines to prevent dreadful infections.” ALSO READ: UAE flights: Some students skip first week of school to avoid soaring airfare costs?
