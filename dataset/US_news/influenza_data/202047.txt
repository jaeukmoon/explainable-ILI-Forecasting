Influenza viruses contain a negative-sense segmented RNA genome that is transcribed and replicated by the viral heterotrimeric RNA polymerase (FluPol) in the context of viral ribonucleoprotein complexes2,3. RNA polymerases of avian influenza A viruses (FluPolA) replicate viral RNA inefficiently in human cells because of species-specific differences in acidic nuclear phosphoprotein 32 (ANP32), a family of essential host proteins for FluPol activity4. Host-adaptive mutations, particularly a glutamic-acid-to-lysine mutation at amino acid residue 627 (E627K) in the 627 domain of the PB2 subunit, enable avian FluPolA to overcome this restriction and efficiently replicate viral RNA in the presence of human ANP32 proteins. However, the molecular mechanisms of genome replication and the interplay with ANP32 proteins remain largely unknown. Here we report cryo-electron microscopy structures of influenza C virus polymerase (FluPolC) in complex with human and chicken ANP32A. In both structures, two FluPolC molecules form an asymmetric dimer bridged by the N-terminal leucine-rich repeat domain of ANP32A. The C-terminal low-complexity acidic region of ANP32A inserts between the two juxtaposed PB2 627 domains of the asymmetric FluPolA dimer, suggesting a mechanism for how the adaptive PB2(E627K) mutation enables the replication of viral RNA in mammalian hosts. We propose that this complex represents a replication platform for the viral RNA genome, in which one of the FluPol molecules acts as a replicase while the other initiates the assembly of the nascent replication product into a viral ribonucleoprotein complex.

Following virus entry, vRNPs are trafficked to the cell nucleus where FluPol, in complex with various host factors, directs the transcription and replication of the viral genome5. For replication, FluPol first generates complementary RNA (cRNA), which then serves as template for viral RNA (vRNA) synthesis. The molecular details of the replicase complex and, in particular, the role of the ANP32 family of host proteins, known to be essential for genome replication6, remain unknown. Here we investigate the role of ANP32A in promoting FluPol function and uncover a complex of ANP32A with a FluPol dimer, which we propose acts as a replication platform for the viral genome.ANP32A forms a complex with a FluPol dimerHost ANP32 proteins are essential for the activity of FluPol of both influenza A and influenza B viruses7,8. To address whether FluPol from influenza C virus also requires ANP32 proteins, we performed minigenome assays in human cells lacking ANP32A and ANP32B (Extended Data Fig. 1). No detectable FluPol activity was observed in the double-knockout cells, but expression of human ANP32A (huANP32A), human ANP32B (huANP32B) or chicken ANP32A (chANP32A) restored FluPolC activity. We then used cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to solve the structures of FluPolC in complex with huANP32A and chANP32A at a resolution ranging from 3.0 Å to 3.6 Å (Fig. 1a, b, Extended Data Figs. 2, 3, Extended Data Table 1, Supplementary Video 1). In these structures, two heterotrimeric FluPolC molecules assemble into an asymmetric dimer with the N-terminal leucine-rich repeat domain of ANP32A (ANP32ALRR)9 bridging the two FluPolC molecules. The C-terminal low-complexity acidic region of ANP32A (ANP32ALCAR) could not be fully resolved in the structures. The structures of FluPolC dimers with huANP32A and chANP32A are largely identical, exhibiting the same FluPolC–FluPolC and FluPolC–ANP32ALRR interaction interfaces. About 22% of particles in the FluPolC–chANP32A dataset lack density for ANP32A and were used to reconstruct a 3.4 Å resolution polymerase-only structure, which shows the same arrangement of FluPolC dimer as the ANP32A-containing complexes (Fig. 1c, Extended Data Figs. 2 and 3, Extended Data Table 1).Fig. 1: Structures of dimers of FluPolC heterotrimers with or without bound ANP32A.a–c, Cryo-EM structures of dimers of FluPolC heterotrimers with huANP32A (a) or chANP32A (b), and without ANP32A (c).Full size imageFluPol forms an asymmetric dimerThe first FluPol molecule (hereafter designated as the FluPol replicase, FluPolR) is fully resolved in the density map and shows a configuration of the peripheral flexible domains that is distinct from the one in the cap-snatching competent transcriptase, but similar to the configuration previously observed for RNA-free FluPol and FluPol bound to cRNA10,11 (Fig. 1, Extended Data Fig. 4, Supplementary Video 1). Specifically, the cap-binding domain of PB2 (PB2cap) is immobilized through extensive contacts with the palm subdomain of PB1, while the nuclear localization signal domain of PB2 (PB2NLS) intimately associates with the N-terminal endonuclease domain of P3 (P3endo). The 627 domain of PB2 (PB2627), named after the host-specific amino acid residue 627, makes relatively few contacts with the rest of FluPolR. FluPolR is bound to a 47-nucleotide long vRNA, whose 5′ terminus is clearly resolved and shows the typical hook structure bound in a pocket formed by P3 and PB1, as observed previously12,13 (Fig. 1, Extended Data Fig. 5). In the majority of particles, the 3′ vRNA terminus cannot be resolved, but the density observed around the template entry channel suggests that it has entered the active site. In about 10% of FluPolC–chANP32A and about 7% of FluPolC–huANP32A particles, the 3′ vRNA terminus is bound at the interface of the C-terminal domain of P3, the thumb subdomain of PB1 and the N1 subdomain of PB2, as recently described for FluPolA and influenza D FluPol12,14,15. The second FluPol molecule (hereafter designated as the encapsidating FluPol, FluPolE) shows a markedly different configuration of the flexible domains. The C-terminal flexible domains of PB2 (PB2cap, PB2 mid-link domain (PB2mid-link), PB2627 and PB2NLS) flip over to pack against the C-terminal domain of the P3 subunit (P3CTD) (Extended Data Fig. 4, Supplementary Video 1). P3endo, several N-terminal domains of PB2 and the C-terminal 18 amino acid residues of PB2NLS are disordered in FluPolE. Furthermore, approximately 52% of FluPolC–chANP32A and all FluPolC–huANP32A particles lack density for PB2cap and PB2mid-link in FluPolE, suggesting that these domains are flexible. No RNA was found associated with FluPolE. The two FluPolC molecules make extensive interactions, mainly between their respective PB2 and P3 subunits, to form a large polymerase dimer interface burying a total of ~1,500 Å2 (Fig. 2a). The PB2627 domain of FluPolR interacts with the P3CTD, PB2627 and PB2NLS domains of FluPolE (Fig. 2b), and the P3CTD domain of FluPolE stacks against the PB2 N2 (PB2N2) and PB2mid-link domains of FluPolR (Fig. 2c). In addition, the P3 arch and PB1 β-hairpin of FluPolE contact the P3CTD and PB2N2 domains of FluPolR (Fig. 2d). This dimer interface is distinct from the one observed previously in FluPolA, which promotes template realignment and is required for replication initiation on a cRNA12,16. To address the functional relevance of this dimer interface in influenza A virus, we introduced alanine mutations to several clusters of amino acid residues in FluPolA located at or close to the dimer interface on the basis of the structure of the FluPolC heterotrimeric dimer. These include the residues PA K324/H326/E327, PA K339/Q340 and PB2 P132, which are structurally equivalent to P3 R299/K301/D302, P3 N318/Q319 and PB2 E139 in FluPolC, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 1). All of these mutations resulted in a reduction of viral RNA levels in a minigenome assay analysing FluPol function (Extended Data Fig. 6a). These data indicate that amino acid residues at the asymmetric FluPol dimer interface we have identified in the FluPolC–ANP32A complexes are important for FluPol activity.Fig. 2: FluPolC–FluPolC and ANP32A–FluPolC interaction interfaces.a, The FluPolC–FluPolC dimer interface with interacting regions in FluPolR and FluPolE highlighted on the molecular surface; the two molecules are shown peeled apart by 30° to highlight the surface.

The N-terminal region of ANP32ALRR interacts with FluPolR, involving multiple regions of PB2, including the lid domain (PB2lid), PB2627 and PB2NLS (Fig. 2e, f). These interactions bury a total of about 600 Å2 at the interface between ANP32A and FluPolR. The C-terminal region of ANP32ALRR interacts with the P3CTD domain and the N terminus of PB1 of FluPolE, and buries a total of about 490 Å2 at the interface (Fig. 2e, g, h). ANP32A N129 and D130, previously identified as important for FluPolA binding and activity8,17, are directly involved in the interaction with FluPolE. Specifically, N129 is sandwiched between M387 and K391 of P3 and interacts with K391 directly through hydrogen bonding, whereas D130 interacts with K608 of P3 (Fig. 2g). To address the functional relevance of this interaction, we mutated PA K413 in FluPolA—equivalent to P3 K391 in FluPolC (Fig. 2g, Supplementary Fig. 1)—to alanine. This mutant FluPolA showed reduced binding to huANP32A and loss of activity in a minigenome assay (Extended Data Fig. 7). Further mutations in FluPolA at PA D529 and PB2 T609, corresponding to P3 E513 and PB2 H631 in FluPolC (Fig. 2f, g, Supplementary Fig. 1), had similar inhibitory effects on both ANP32A binding and FluPol activity. Together, these data confirm the functional relevance of the identified ANP32A–FluPol interaction and provide an explanation for why chicken ANP32B (chANP32B) with I129 and N130 is unable to support FluPol activity8,17.ANP32ALCAR interacts with PB2627 Species-specific differences in ANP32 proteins underpin the low activity of avian FluPolA in mammalian cells4. Amino acid differences important for FluPol activity have been identified in both ANP32ALRR and ANP32ALCAR, but a 33-amino-acid insertion in the avian ANP32ALCAR relative to mammalian ANP32ALCAR was found to be the most critical for the ability of avian ANP32A to support the activity of avian FluPolA4,18,19 (Fig. 3a). Although the ANP32ALCAR could not be assigned unambiguously in the map, continuous density shows that it contacts PB2627 of FluPolR (Fig. 3b, c, Supplementary Video 2). These data are in agreement with previous reports of a direct interaction between ANP32A and the PB2627 domain using biochemical methods and NMR20,21,22. In the FluPolC–chANP32A structure, the negatively charged chANP32ALCAR binds in a basic groove formed by the PB2627 domains of FluPolR and FluPolE, with the avian-specific 33-amino-acid insertion directly contacting the PB2627 domain of FluPolR. This interaction positions a previously identified hydrophobic SUMO interaction motif-like sequence23 (Extended Data Fig. 1c) on top of PB2627, as well as a downstream region of the ANP32LCAR which contains a mixture of basic and acidic amino acid residues (176-VLSLVKDR-183) (Fig. 3a–c). Specifically, this motif is located next to PB2 K649 (equivalent to E627 in the PB2 of avian FluPolA) and V614. PB2 V614 is equivalent to K591 in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza A virus, which was of swine origin, and retained E627 in its avian PB2 but used a Q591K adaptation to increase polymerase activity24,25 (Extended Data Fig. 8, Supplementary Fig. 1). Interaction of this region of ANP32A with PB2627 could be critical for stabilization of the interaction between ANP32A and FluPol and, consequently, for the ability of ANP32A to support FluPol activity. The presence of a mixture of basic and acidic amino acid residues in this region could explain why avian ANP32A is able to support FluPol with either avian-specific 627E or mammalian-specific 627K in PB2. The corresponding region in huANP32A (176-EEEYDEDA-183), as well as in the huANP32B isoform (176-DEEDEDDE-183), is entirely acidic (Fig. 3a), potentially explaining the need to eliminate the acidic residue 627 in avian FluPolA upon viral transmission to a mammalian host. To test this hypothesis, we replaced the acidic 176–183 region of huANP32A with the corresponding region from chANP32A and found that this mutant form of huANP32A was able to fully support the activity of FluPolA with 627E in mammalian cells (Fig. 3d). These data are also in agreement with a previous study reporting that FluPolA can tolerate a range of non-acidic amino acid residues at position 627 and activity is positively correlated with the pI value of the amino acid26. Thus, our data provide an explanation for adaptive mutations observed in FluPolA upon transmission of influenza A virus from an avian to a human host.Fig. 3: Interaction of ANP32LCAR with FluPolC and the effect of ANP32A on FluPolA activity.a, Schematic of huANP32A and chANP32A, highlighting the 33-amino-acid insertion (33 aa) (yellow) in chANP32A and sequence differences. huANP32A(ch176–183) is a huANP32A construct in which residues 176–183 are replaced by those from chANP32A.

Regions potentially corresponding to the N-terminal part of ANP32ALCAR and part of the avian 33-amino-acid insertion are highlighted in cyan and yellow, respectively.

Data are mean ± s.e.m., n = 3 biologically independent samples from 3 independent experiments. Ordinary one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s post hoc test for multiple comparisons. P < 0.05 is considered significant to reject the null hypothesis. Gel source data are presented in Supplementary Fig. 2.Full size imageImplications for genome replicationThe product exit channel of vRNA-bound FluPolR, located along the PB1 finger domains and PB2cap, points towards the 5′-cRNA binding site of FluPolE, which is located next to the PA arch (residues 343–376) and the PB1 β-hairpin (residues 353–370)13,15. A path lined with basic amino acid residues connects this exit channel with the 5′-cRNA binding site of FluPolE (Fig. 4a, Supplementary Video 3) and FluPolE is thus ideally positioned to capture the 5′ end of a nascent cRNA product emerging from the active site of FluPolR. This suggests that in the FluPolC–ANP32A complex, FluPolR functions as the replicase, whereas FluPolE acts as an ‘encapsidating’ polymerase, initiating the co-replicative assembly of the nascent cRNA with NP into a complementary ribonucleoprotein (cRNP) complex. To test this hypothesis, we performed a cRNA-stabilization assay27 to examine the ability of FluPol to encapsidate nascent cRNA product. Mutations in FluPolE at PA K324/H326/E327 and PA K339/Q340 caused a substantial reduction in cRNA accumulation. Note that PB2 P132 is located on the FluPolR side of the interface and therefore this mutation could not be tested using this assay. These data confirm that the FluPolR–FluPolE interface is important for encapsidation of a nascent cRNA product (Extended Data Fig. 6b). The PB2627 domain of FluPolE has been implicated in cRNA encapsidation using this assay, which is consistent with our model28. We propose that a similar mechanism is likely to apply for cRNA-bound FluPolR, owing to intrinsic similarities between cRNA synthesis and vRNA synthesis, which both require co-replicative encapsidation of nascent RNA.Fig. 4: Functional implications of the FluPolC–ANP32A complex.a, Relative positions of the RNA-product exit channel in FluPolR and the 5′-RNA binding site in FluPolE in the chANP32A–FluPolC complex. The positions of the RNA-product exit channel in FluPolR and the 5′-RNA binding site in FluPolE were determined by superposing FluPolR and FluPolE with the structure of FluPolA bound to capped RNA and vRNA template (Protein Data Bank (PDB): 6RR7). b, Model for the role of FluPol–ANP32A complex in the replication of the influenza virus RNA genome and its assembly into vRNPs. FluPol in the context of vRNP or cRNP is flexible (1) but is stabilized in a replicase FluPolR conformation upon binding of a newly synthesized FluPol in the presence of ANP32A (2). FluPolR initiates replication in a primer-independent manner (3), with a trans-activating FluPol involved in cRNA to vRNA replication by promoting cRNA template realignment (3′). As the 5′ end of the nascent replication product is released from the polymerization active site of FluPolR, it is captured in the 5′-RNA binding pocket of the encapsidating FluPolE bound to FluPolR (4), initiating the encapsidation of the nascent RNA with NP (5). Nascent vRNA or cRNA assemble into vRNPs or cRNPs, respectively (6), and are released upon FluPolR termination. FluPolE becomes the resident polymerase of the newly produced vRNP or cRNP.Full size imageSuch a role for the FluPol–ANP32A complex in viral genome replication is consistent with previous observations; in particular, ANP32A and the adaptive PB2 E627K mutation have been specifically linked to viral genome replication rather than transcription7,29,30 providing strong support for a role of the FluPol–ANP32A complex in replication. We were unable to fully resolve ANP32ALCAR in our structures, indicating that this part of ANP32A is highly dynamic. Replication involves viral NP, which co-replicatively coats viral RNA along its length, but it is currently unknown how NP is recruited onto the growing nascent chain of RNA. Non-segmented negative-strand RNA viruses encode an acidic phosphoprotein (P) that is an essential component of their RNA polymerase complex and is involved in recruiting NP to nascent replication product31. Segmented negative-strand RNA viruses do not encode an equivalent protein and it is tempting to speculate that its function is performed by a cellular protein such as ANP32A. Specifically, the unstructured region of ANP32ALCAR, downstream of the region interacting with FluPolR, could act as a molecular whip recruiting NP in a manner analogous to that proposed for the P phosphoprotein.Understanding the structural basis for why ANP32A is fundamental to influenza virus replication opens a new perspective on the role of ANP32A and host-adaptive mutations in FluPol function. Specifically, our data suggest that the FluPol–ANP32A complex represents a replication platform for the influenza virus RNA genome. The mechanistic insights gained from this study have enabled us to build a more complete picture of the structural basis for the viral replication cycle. During infection, incoming vRNPs bind to the C-terminal domain of host RNA polymerase II through interactions primarily mediated by the C-terminal domain of FluPol PA32,33. This interaction stabilizes FluPol in a cap-snatching-competent conformation, enabling the cleavage of host capped RNAs that serve as primers for the initiation of viral mRNA synthesis33. Accumulation of newly synthesized FluPol favours genome replication over transcription, consistent with a transition from transcription to replication as infection proceeds, through forming an asymmetric dimer with the vRNP-associated resident FluPol and stabilizing it in a replication-competent conformation, enabling primer-independent initiation of replication (Fig. 4). ANP32A contributes to the stabilization of this dimer by bridging the two FluPol molecules. Several lines of evidence suggest that ANP32A is involved in cRNA-to-vRNA replication, although there is also evidence in favour of a role during vRNA-to-cRNA replication7,18,29,30. In particular, avian polymerase in human cells is incapable of generating replication-competent cRNPs, suggesting that cRNA encapsidation—and hence the correct assembly of cRNPs—might be affected29; this is fully consistent with our data showing that mutations at the FluPolR–FluPolE dimer interface interfere with cRNA encapsidation. ANP32A may have a particularly important role in stabilizing the interaction of a free FluPol with a cRNP-associated FluPol, as cRNPs need to make at least two different interactions with free FluPol molecules using two different interaction interfaces, to promote template realignment and nascent-product encapsidation. These interactions need to be fine-tuned in a host-dependent manner, in agreement with the observation of adaptive mutations at the dimer interfaces12,34. Dependence on free FluPol to ensure template realignment during replication initiation on a cRNA template12 and co-replicative genome assembly into a vRNP both provide the virus with a safety mechanism to avoid the generation of naked viral RNA in the absence of viral protein synthesis, which could otherwise be a trigger for activating innate immune responses35. The identification of amino acid residues involved in mediating ANP32A–FluPol interactions will facilitate both the development of novel small-molecule inhibitors that disrupt the interaction interface and the design of genetically engineered animals resilient to influenza virus.MethodsNo statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. The experiments were not randomized and investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment.CellsHuman embryonic kidney 293T (HEK 293T) and Sf9 insect cells were sourced from the Cell Bank of the Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, University of Oxford. HEK 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) and Sf9 cells were maintained in Sf-900 II serum free medium (Gibco). Human eHAP cells (Horizon Discovery), control or lacking ANP32A and ANP32B proteins (dKO), were cultured in Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s medium (IMDM; Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Sigma), 1% nonessential amino acids (NEAA; Gibco), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco) and have been described7. Cell lines have not been authenticated but tested negative for mycoplasma contamination.Protein expression and purificationThe three subunits of influenza C/Johannesburg/1/1966 virus polymerase, together with human or chicken ANP32A, were co-expressed in Sf9 cells from codon-optimized genes (GeneArt) cloned into a single baculovirus using the MultiBac system36. Expression and purification of the co-expressed complex were performed as previously described10,12 with minor modifications: the salt concentration in all buffers was set to 150 mM to maintain FluPolC–ANP32A complex formation. Size-exclusion chromatography was performed using 25 mM HEPES–NaOH, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl and 5% (v/v) glycerol on a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare).Cryo-EM sample preparationProtein surface charges of the purified complex were neutralized by adding 0.001% glutaraldehyde for 20 min on ice to minimize preferential orientation of particles. After quenching the reaction by adding Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 to a final concentration of 100 mM, the sample was injected onto a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) together with a 47 nt vRNA (5′-AGUAGAAACAAGGGUAUUUUUCUUUACUAGUCUACCCUGCUUUUGCU-3′) using 25 mM HEPES–NaOH, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl as the running buffer. This 47-nucleotide (nt) vRNA contains the 5′ and 3′ promoter elements recognized and bound by FluPol. The fractions of interest were concentrated to 0.23–0.28 mg ml−1 and RNA binding was confirmed by measuring the A260/A280 ratio. A final concentration of 0.005% (v/v) Tween 20 was added before grid preparation. A volume of 3–4 μl of sample was placed on glow-discharged Quantifoil Holey Carbon grids (R 2/1, with 2 μm holes and 1 μm spacing and applied on biocompatible 200 gold mesh), before blotting for 3.0–3.5 s and flash-freezing in liquid ethane. All grids were prepared using a Vitrobot mark IV (FEI) at 95–100% humidity.Cryo-EM image collection and processingCryo-EM data for the FluPolC–chANP32A sample were collected on a 300 kV Titan Krios microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at the Division of Structural Biology (Strubi). Automated data collection was setup in EPU 2.1 using a K2 Summit (Gatan) direct electron detector at 1.37 Å per pixel operating in counting mode and a GIF Quantum energy filter (Gatan) with 20 eV slit. Sample was collected with a tilt angle of 30° at a dose of ~38.8 e− Å−2 across 44 frames for a dose rate of ~3.527 e− Å−2 s−1, using a defocus range of −2 μm to −3.5 μm. Cryo-EM data for the FluPolC–huANP32A sample were collected on a 300 kV Titan Krios microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at Electron Bio-Imaging Centre (eBIC). Automated data collection was setup in SerialEM 3.7 using a K3 (Gatan) direct electron detector operating in super-resolution mode at 0.5425 Å per pixel and a GIF Quantum energy filter (Gatan) with 20 eV slit. Sample was collected with a tilt angle of 20° at a dose of ~32.1 e− Å−2 across 34 frames for a dose rate of ~16 e− Å−2 s−1, using a defocus range of −2 μm to −3.5 μm. Sample-specific data collection parameters are summarized in Extended Data Table 1. Data processing pipelines are shown in Extended Data Fig. 1. In brief, raw movies were processed using MotionCor2-1.1.037, with a five-by-five patch-based alignment, keeping all of the frames and dose-weighting up to the total exposure. For the K3 super-resolution, the data have been binned 2 times at the motion correction step, giving a final pixel size of 1.085 Å per pixel. The contrast transfer function (CTF) of full-dose, non-weighted micrographs was initially estimated using Gctf-v.1.0638 or cryoSPARC v.2.12.039 Patch-CTF. Poor-quality images were discarded after manual inspection. Particles were blob picked in cryoSPARC v.2.12.039 and the 2D classes were inspected and classes of interest were selected to generate templates for complete particle picking. For the FluPolC–chANP32A dataset, a total number of 2,534,332 particles were picked and a final number of 772,989 particles were exported to RELION 3.140 after 2D and 3D class selection. The consensus map was refined to 3.50 Å. Bayesian polishing and per particle CTF refinement and B-factor estimation with beam tilt correction were performed in RELION 3.1 which improved map resolution to 3.2 Å. High order aberration and magnification anisotropy refinement improved map resolution to 3.1 Å. Global and focus 3D classification were performed within RELION (Extended Data Fig. 2a). For the 3D variability analysis, polished particles and model were imported into cryoSPARC v.2.12.0 and refined using the non-uniform refinement job. A mask was then designed around the density corresponding to the PB2627 domains of both polymerases and chANP32A. The 3D variability analysis was then performed using this mask, asking for solving the three main modes on a structure low pass filtered to 6 Å. The results of this principal component analysis were clustered in twenty sub-populations and models were reconstructed for each of the individual clusters. One cluster was showing a clear density for the chANP32ALCAR region and was refined using the non-uniform refinement job to 3.6 Å (Subclass 2). In parallel, all of the particles having a strong density for chANP32A were selected and refined using the non-uniform refinement job to 3.1 Å. The same 3D variability analysis was performed, asking for solving the three main modes on a structure low pass filtered to 6 Å. Mode 3 is displayed as Supplementary Video 2. For the FluPolC–huANP32A dataset, a total number of 2,312,045 particles were picked and a final number of 835,198 particles were exported to RELION 3.1 after 2D and 3D class selection. The consensus map was refined to 3.2 Å. Bayesian polishing and per particle CTF refinement and B-factor estimation with beam tilt correction were performed in RELION 3.1 which improved map resolution to 2.8 Å. Global and focus 3D classification were performed within RELION (Extended Data Fig. 2b). CryoEF41 and 3D Fourier shell correlation (FSC)42 sphericity scores were used to confirm that the final maps were not suffering from distortion bias due to preferred specimen orientation. The structures were modelled by first fitting ANP32ALRR (PDB ID: 4XOS), FluPolC (PDB ID: 5D98) and 5′ and 3′ vRNA termini (PDB ID: 6RR7) using UCSF Chimera43. One cycle of rigid body real space refinement followed by manual adjustment in Coot44 was performed to correctly position the Cα chain into the density. Locally sharpened maps were generated using LocScale45 in the CCP-EM46 package. Finally, cycles of PHENIX47 real space refinement and manual building in Coot44 were used to improve model geometry. Map-to-model comparison in PHENIX mtriage validated that no over-fitting was present in the structures. Model geometry was validated for all models using MolProbity48. All map and model statistics are detailed in Extended Data Table 1. A homology model of FluPolA–ANP32A complex structure was generated using SWISS-MODEL49.PlasmidsPlasmids pHMG-PB1, pHMG-PB2, pHMG-P3 and pHMG-NP expressing the subunits of FluPolC and NP of influenza C/Johannesburg/1/66 virus and pPolI-Luci-CP3-RT expressing a luciferase reporter have been described50,51. pcDNA-PB1, pcDNA-PB1a (catalytically inactive; D445A/D446A), pcDNA-PB2, pcDNA-PB2 K627E, pcDNA-PA, pcDNA-NP and pPOLI-NA, which encodes an NA vRNA segment, are derived from influenza A/WSN/33 virus and have been described previously27,52,53,54. pCAGGS-chANP32A has been described previously4. pcDNA-huANP32A and pCAGGS-huANP32A-Strep were produced from pCAGGS-huANP32A4 by restriction-ligation cloning. pcDNA-huANP32A(ch176-183), pcDNA-PB2 T609A, pcDNA-PB2 P132A, pcDNA-PA D529A/R531A/E533A, pcDNA-PA K413A, pcDNA-PA K324A/H326A/E327A and pcDNA-PA K339A/Q340A were generated from pcDNA-huANP32A, pcDNA-PB2 and pcDNA-PA by site-directed PCR mutagenesis and validated by Sanger sequencing.Influenza C virus vRNP-reconstitution and luciferase-reporter assaysApproximately 0.2 × 106 eHAP cells, control or dKO, were transfected with plasmids pHMG-PB1, pHMG-PB2, pHMG-P3, pHMG-NP, pPolI-Luci-CP3-RT and pcDNA-Renilla using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Where indicated, plasmids pCAGGS-huANP32A, pCAGGS-huANP32B or pCAGGS-chANP32A were included. Cells were lysed 24 h after transfection using Passive lysis buffer (Promega). Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured using a Promega dual luciferase kit and firefly activity levels were normalized to the Renilla control.Influenza A virus vRNP-reconstitution assay and primer extension analysisApproximately 0.2 × 106 HEK 293T cells were transfected with plasmids pcDNA-PB1, pcDNA-PB2, pcDNA-PA, pcDNA-NP and pPOLI-NA using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Where indicated, plasmids encoding ANP32A proteins or mutant polymerase subunits were included. Total cellular RNA was extracted 20 h after transfection using TRI reagent (Sigma) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. NA segment RNA levels were assessed using primer extension55. In brief, primers complementary to the positive (5′-TGGACTAGTGGGAGCATCAT-3′) and negative (5′-TCCAGTATGGTTTTGATTTCCG-3′) sense NA segment viral RNA species were labelled with 32P and total cellular RNA was reverse transcribed. A primer complementary to 5S rRNA (5′-TCCCAGGCGGTCTCCCATCC-3′) was included as a loading control. Products were resolved by 6% denaturing PAGE and visualized by phosphorimaging. Product bands were identified by comparison with previously published data56,57. Analysis was carried out using ImageJ58 and Prism 8 (GraphPad), and viral RNA signals were normalized to the 5S rRNA loading control.Western blottingWestern blotting of all proteins was carried out using specific rabbit polyclonal antibodies. PB1 and PB2 were blotted using commercially available antibodies (Genetex), while PA was blotted using a custom-made antibody59. ANP32A and actin were blotted using commercially available antibodies (Sigma). In all cases the secondary antibody used was goat anti-rabbit conjugated to HRP, and Amersham ECL Western Blotting Detection Reagents (GE Healthcare) were used for detection.Affinity purification assaysApproximately 2 × 106 HEK 293T cells were transfected with pcDNA-PB1, pcDNA-PB2, pcDNA-PA and pCAGGS-huANP32A-Strep. 48 h after transfection, cells were lysed in 500 μl of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 25% glycerol, 0.5% Igepal CA-630, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, 1 × complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail tablet (Roche)) for 1 h at 4 °C and cellular debris was cleared by centrifugation for 5 min at 17,000g. The supernatant was diluted in 2 ml 150 mM NaCl and incubated with Strep-Tactin beads (IBA) for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times in wash buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Igepal CA-630, 1 mM PMSF) and complexes were eluted in 1× buffer E (IBA) for 16 h at 4 °C. Eluted complexes were analysed by 12% SDS PAGE and western blotting.cRNA-encapsidation assayscRNA-encapsidation assays were performed as described previously27. In brief, approximately 1 × 106 HEK 293T cells were transfected with pcDNA-PB1a, pcDNA-PB2, pcDNA-PA and pcDNA-NP using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Forty-eight hours after transfection, culture medium was replaced with DMEM containing 0.5% FBS and 5 μg ml−1 actinomycin D and influenza A/WSN/33 virus at multiplicity of infection 5.0. Total cellular RNA was extracted 6 h after infection using Trizol (Sigma) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and viral RNA levels were determined by primer extension analysis as described above.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this paper.

We aimed to describe the characteristics of patients vulnerable to hospital-acquired influenza A and to identify its risk factors to assist clinicians control hospital-acquired infections and reduce the burden of treatment.MethodsA case-control study was conducted among hospitalized patients aged ≥18 years at a tertiary level teaching hospital during the 2018–2019 influenza A season. Patient data were retrieved from hospital-based electronic medical records. Hospital-acquired influenza A was defined as a case of influenza A diagnosed 7 days or more after admission, in a patient with no evidence of influenza A infection on admission. The controls without influenza A were selected among patients exposed to the same setting and time period. We identified risk factors using conditional logistic regression and described the characteristics of hospital-acquired influenza A by comparing the clinical data of infected patients and the controls.ResultsOf the 412 hospitalized patients with influenza A from all the departments in the study hospital, 93 (22.6%) cases were classified as hospital-acquired. The most common comorbidities of the 93 cases were hypertension (41.9%), coronary heart disease (21.5%), and cerebrovascular disease (20.4%). Before the onset of hospital-acquired influenza A, patients presented more lymphocytopenia (51.6% vs 35.5%, P = 0.027), hypoalbuminemia (78.5% vs 57.0%, P = 0.002), and pleural effusion (26.9% vs 9.7%, P = 0.002) than the matched controls. Infected patients also had longer hospital stays (18 days vs 14 days, P = 0.002), and higher mortality rates (10.8% vs 2.2%, P = 0.017) than the matched controls. Lymphocytopenia (odds ratio [OR]: 3.11; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.24–7.80; P = 0.016), hypoalbuminemia (OR: 2.24; 95% CI: 1.10–4.57; P = 0.027), and pleural effusion (OR: 3.09; 95% CI: 1.26–7.58; P = 0.014) were independently associated with hospital-acquired influenza A.ConclusionsLymphocytopenia, hypoalbuminemia and pleural effusion are independent risk factors that can help identify patients at high risk of hospital-acquired influenza A, which can extend hospital stay and is associated with a high mortality. Peer Review reports BackgroundThe mutation rate of influenza A virus is the highest among the three reported subtypes of human influenza virus (A, B, and C) [1]. Large-scale human-to-human transmission of influenza A virus can occur biannually, in winter and spring. Outbreaks of influenza A virus infection in hospitalized patients have been reported in a variety of clinical settings including neonatal intensive care units [2], geriatric wards [3], and hematology units [4]. Hospital-acquired influenza A attacks hospitalized patients with a primary disease and results in additional treatment burdens and adverse health consequences.Hospital-acquired influenza A may be associated with a poor prognosis. In Germany, a case fatality rate of 9% was mainly associated with influenza virus A (H1N1) pdm09 [5], and in Sweden, a hospital-acquired influenza A with a case fatality rate of 9.6% has been reported [6]. Moreover, hospital-acquired influenza A has been reported to be an independent factor associated with mortality among patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) [7].Hospitals are semi-closed settings and hospitalized patients are in close contact with each other. Patients with influenza A in the incubation period can be asymptomatic sources of infection [8]. The incubation period may be as long as 7 days [9], which makes the prevention and control of influenza A among hospitalized patients a major challenge. Therefore, the early recognition of patients with a high risk of hospital-acquired influenza A can play an important role in the prevention of influenza A outbreaks among hospitalized patients.Although the clinical and epidemiological features of hospital-acquired influenza A are well-documented [10, 11], there have been few studies on its risk factors. While other published studies chose community-acquired influenza A cases as controls [7, 12], our study selected controls that were hospitalized in the same department and during the same time period without acquiring the infection, and thus matching cases and controls more reliably.This study aimed to identify the risk factors for hospital-acquired influenza A, so that vulnerable individuals could be identified at an early stage.MethodsDesign and study populationThis single-center retrospective matched case-control study analyzed the medical records of patients with hospital-acquired influenza A and matched controls from a tertiary level teaching hospital in Xi’an China during the 2018–2019 influenza A season from December 1, 2018 to April 31, 2019.Patients hospitalized for more than 24 h with an influenza-like illness (ILI), and confirmed as having influenza A by a laboratory test conducted on the day that they developed the ILI, were selected from the wards of different departments. The preliminary objective was to describe the epidemiological characteristics of influenza A diagnosed among hospitalized patients. Subsequently, we classified the cases diagnosed 7 days or more after admission as hospital-acquired influenza A (Fig. 1). Fig. 1A flow chart showing the patient selectionFull size imageThe controls were patients without influenza A and were matched in a 1:1 ratio according to hospital department, age, and period of hospitalization (Fig. 1). Patients less than 18 years old were excluded from this study. Formatted case report forms (CRFs) were used to collect clinical information of hospital-acquired influenza A patients and the matched controls.Case definitionsAccording to the 2018 version of the Diagnostic and Treatment Protocol for Influenza [8] released by the National Health and Family Planning Commission of the People’s Republic of China, the main manifestations of ILI were fever, headache, cough, nasal congestion, runny nose, and systemic symptoms such as muscle and joint aches, fatigue, and loss of appetite. During the influenza season, patients who met these ILI criteria were considered to be suspected influenza A cases. A confirmed diagnosis of influenza A was based on the manifestation of ILI symptoms combined with a positive result from a real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for influenza A performed using a nasopharyngeal swab sample. Considering that the maximum incubation period for influenza A was up to 7 days [9], hospital-acquired influenza A was defined as cases diagnosed 7 or more days after admission, among patients who had no evidence of influenza A infection on admission. In addition, pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients with respiratory symptoms who screened negative for influenza A virus upon admission and subsequently tested positive 7 or more days later, were eligible for inclusion.Since the influenza A virus is spread mainly through aerosols, droplets, or by contact [13], with age being a potential confounding factor for the influenza A virus infection [14], we matched every hospital-acquired influenza A patient with a clearly defined control. The control was required to be exposed to the same setting for the same period of time, in other words, the control was required to have been hospitalized for 7 days or longer in a ward of same department on the date when the matched patient was diagnosed with influenza A, and the age difference was required to be within 5 years.There were two types of controls: The first type consisted of patients who showed no ILI manifestation during hospitalization, with no need for a RT-PCR test; with the second type being patients who showed respiratory symptoms similar to ILI during hospitalization but who tested negative for influenza A virus; their respiratory symptoms clearly caused by bacterial pneumonia or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.Data collectionA CRF was designed for data collection, including demographics (age, sex), date of hospital admission, underlying diseases, date of diagnosis of influenza A, length of the hospital stay, laboratory findings, department, ICU admission, use of corticosteroids, initial radiographic findings, and outcomes. Vaccination status was obtained by follow-up investigations with telephone calls.According to previous reports [7, 9], the influenza A incubation period ranges from 1 to 7 days. To reflect pre-infection characteristics and avoid the influence from infection in the incubation period, we collected data of every hospital-acquired influenza A case for the date 7 days before the influenza A diagnosis, and used the same date for collecting the data of each matched control.Statistical analysisCategorical variables were presented as frequencies and percentages. Continuous variables were presented as means and standard deviations (SDs) for data that followed a normal distribution, or as medians and interquartile ranges if the data distribution departed from normality. The characteristics of patients with hospital-acquired influenza A and their matched controls were compared. The t-test or Mann-Whitney U test was used for comparing continuous variables. The chi-squared test was used to compare categorical variables. Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05. All variables with P values < 0.15 in the univariate analysis, and sex, age and corticosteroid use were included in the conditional logistic regression analysis to identify the independent risk factors for hospital-acquired influenza A. In the regression analysis, the minimum sample size required was estimated empirically, equal to the number of independent variables multiplied by 20 [15]. The analysis was performed using SPSS version 20.0 statistical software (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY, USA).ResultsEpidemiological characteristics of influenza a in hospitalized patientsDuring the 2018–2019 influenza A season, we identified a total of 1336 hospitalized patients who had an ILI and were suspected to have influenza A (Fig. 1). The epidemiological characteristics of the suspected and confirmed influenza A in hospitalized patients are shown in Table 1. The positive rate of diagnosis among patients with suspected influenza A was significantly higher in January than in February, March and April (Supplemental Table S1). Suspected influenza A patients from the Nephrology and Geriatric Departments had higher positive rates of diagnosis (61.4 and 45.6%, respectively) than the overall rate (30.8%; P < 0.001 and P = 0.002, respectively; Supplemental Tables S2 and S3). Table 1 Epidemiological characteristics of the suspected and the confirmed cases of influenza AFull size tableA total of 93 cases diagnosed 7 days or more after admission were classified as having hospital-acquired influenza A, and the temporal distribution characteristics are shown in Fig. 2. The epidemiological characteristics are shown in Table 2. Of these cases, 68.8% were confirmed 7 to 14 days after admission, and 31.2% were confirmed more than 14 days after admission. Twenty-two cases (23.7%) had a history of ICU admission during their hospitalization, including the nine that were confirmed after discharge from ICU and the thirteen that were diagnosed during hospitalization in ICU.

Approximately 90.3% of the infected patients had underlying chronic diseases. Hypertension, coronary heart disease, and cerebrovascular disease were the most common comorbidities, while 26.9% of patients were diagnosed pneumonia on admission. Compared with the controls, the cases had a higher prevalence of lymphocytopenia (51.6% vs 35.5%, P = 0.027), a lower median lymphocyte count (1070 vs 1300 cells/μL, P = 0.045), and a higher prevalence of anemia (55.9% vs 45.2%, P = 0.142), hypoalbuminemia (78.5% vs 57.0%, P = 0.002), pleural effusion (26.9% vs 9.7%, P = 0.002), and a higher frequency of corticosteroid use (50.5% vs 43.0%, P = 0.304) prior to the infection of influenza A (Table 3). Notably, patients with hospital-acquired influenza A had a longer hospital stay (median 18 vs 14 days, P = 0.002) and higher mortality rate (10.8% vs 2.2%, P = 0.017) (Table 3). Table 3 The patient characteristics prior to the infection of hospital-acquired influenza AFull size tableThe median age of the hospital-acquired influenza A patients with fatal outcome was 90.5 years (range, from 39 to 94 years). Six cases with poor baseline physical conditions on admission were from the Geriatric Department, and were aged from 90 to 94 years. Two patients, aged 89 and 68 years, were from the Neurology Department, and both had pre-existing cerebrovascular disease and were bedridden, with protracted and intractable pneumonia on admission. One patient, aged 39 years, was from the Cardiac Surgery Department, and had rheumatic heart disease with atrial fibrillation, as well as severe myocardial injury from a mitral valve replacement. One patient, aged 56 years, was from the Hematology Department, and was immunosuppressed with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.Risk factors for hospital-acquired influenza aUnivariate analysis (Table 3) showed that lymphocytopenia, hypoalbuminemia, and pleural effusion can be associated with hospital-acquired influenza A. These three risk factors and anemia (P = 0.142 < 0.15), in addition to sex, age, and corticosteroid use, were included in the conditional logistic regression analysis. Based on the empirical estimation, the minimum total sample size required was 140; therefore, the study sample size (N = 186 for cases and controls combined) was adequate. The logistic regression analysis revealed that lymphocytopenia (OR: 3.11, 95% CI: 1.24–7.80, P = 0.016), hypoalbuminemia (OR: 2.24, 95% CI: 1.10–4.57, P = 0.027) and pleural effusion (OR: 3.09, 95% CI: 1.26–7.58, P = 0.014) were independent risk factors for hospital-acquired influenza A (Table 4). Table 4 Independent risk factors for hospital-acquired influenza AFull size tableDiscussionTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first retrospective matched case-control study of risk factors for hospital-acquired influenza A that included all the different departments of a hospital over a single full influenza A season. This is the first study to identify lymphocytopenia, hypoalbuminemia, and pleural effusion as independent risk factors for hospital-acquired influenza A.In China, according to the overview of epidemic situation of statutory infectious diseases provided by the National Health Commission, the number of influenza (A, B, and C) cases from January 2019 to April 2019 was 1.575 million which is considerably more than the 0.768 million cases reported for the 2018 year [16, 17]. Influenza weekly statistics released by the Chinese National Influenza Center showed that in the first, fifth, and ninth week of 2019, influenza A virus was the main pathogen, accounting for 99.5, 98.1, and 89.9% of influenza cases in the Northern Provinces of China, respectively [18]. In our study, hospital-acquired influenza A cases occurred mainly in January and February 2019. Furthermore, according to the influenza weekly, H1N1 subtype accounted for 92.7 and 86.9% of influenza A in the first and fifth week of 2019 in Northern China, respectively [18].Our study has two main strengths. First, with a strict case definition and a rigorous paired design, we consider that our comparative analysis is more reliable than those of previous studies [7, 12]. Second, hospital-acquired influenza A cases were selected from all the different departments of the hospital in a single influenza A season, indicating that hospital-acquired infection was caused by identical or similar influenza A virus strains, which ensured the comparability and homogeneity of clinical data.Approximately 23% of the influenza cases diagnosed in our study were classified as hospital-acquired. This large proportion of cases may be because of the large increase in the number of influenza cases nationwide in China in early 2019 compared with previous years. Studies conducted in other countries have had similar findings. In a tertiary care hospital in France, during the 2016–2017 influenza A season, 25% of hospitalized patients with influenza A were considered to be hospital-acquired [12]. A German university hospital reported 24% hospital-acquired infection cases in the 2012–2013 influenza season and 20% in the 2013–2014 season [5]. However, a lower proportion of hospital-acquired cases have been observed in other studies. In the UK, during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, 2% of hospitalized cases with influenza A were considered hospital-acquired [19]. In an epidemiological study based on the data of six influenza seasons from 2010 to 2011 to 2015–2016 in Spain, of the hospitalized patients with confirmed severe influenza, 5.6% were classified as hospital-acquired [20].This variability in the prevalence of hospital-acquired influenza A can be attributed to variations in study design and differences between regions and strains of virus. Currently, there is no consensus with respect to the criteria required for declaring an influenza outbreak in a hospital. According to some studies, a hospital-acquired influenza outbreak is defined by an increase in cases of hospital-acquired influenza in a short time and limited space [21, 22].The suspected patients from the Nephrology and Geriatric Departments had a higher positive rate of diagnosis than the average of the hospital. Most patients in the Nephrology Department had chronic kidney diseases, leading to a range of immune system defects [23] such as decreased chemotaxis and phagocytosis of monocyte/macrophage, B-cell lymphopenia, and depressed CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses [24]. Therefore, patients in the Nephrology Department were more vulnerable to the morbidity and mortality associated with influenza infections [25]. Corticosteroids are commonly used drugs in the Nephrology Department and recent research has shown that corticosteroid use can enhance the replication of respiratory viruses [26]. However, corticosteroid use was not a significant risk factor for hospital-acquired influenza A in our study, probably because we matched cases with controls from the same department, and thus the cases and controls were treated with similar medications. It has been reported that age > 65 years was a risk factor for influenza [27]. Thus, suspected patients in the Geriatric Department in a poor basic physical condition can be more likely to test positive for influenza A. During annual seasonal influenza A epidemics, it is recommended that the Nephrology and Geriatric Departments pay more attention to disease prevention and diagnosis.Due to death and loss of follow-up, we were unable to ascertain the vaccination status of a few patients. However, the vaccination uptake among both the hospital-acquired influenza A cases and the controls was only 1.3 and 2.4%, respectively, a difference that was not statistically significant. The coverage of influenza vaccine in the overall Chinese population was reported to be 0.8–2.2% during 2004 to 2014 [28]. Furthermore, in 2017, of the 379 adults aged ≥60 years who were interviewed in a developed city in eastern China, only 0.8% reported receiving the influenza vaccine in the previous year [29]. Currently, self-paid vaccination, unawareness of the need, and few recommendations from medical staff contribute to the low vaccine coverage. By contrast, the vaccination coverage among older people in England, France and Germany reached 73, 49 and 37% respectively during the 2014–2015 season [30].There are several reasons why hospital-acquired viral infections are less likely to be reported than hospital-acquired bacterial infections, including historical attention to bacterial infection [31], difficulties in diagnosis of viral infections, and limited availability of antiviral drugs [11]. Droplet precautions with single room isolation, as an important infection control procedure, are required for all suspected or confirmed cases. This consumes a vast amount of medical resources, creating challenges in the prevention and control of hospital-acquired influenza A. Notably, our study showed that hospital-acquired influenza A carried a considerable risk of death and prolonged hospital stay compared to the control group.Our findings indicated that the Geriatric and Neurology Department had the highest number of hospital-acquired influenza A cases, followed by the Hematology and Cardiac Surgery Departments. During the influenza season, patients who underwent cardiac surgery were more likely to develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [32]. In this study, all patients from the Cardiac Surgery Department had undergone surgery before they acquired influenza A, however we were unable to determine whether cardiac surgery increases the risk of influenza A. This question requires further investigation.Lymphopenia is common among patients with influenza A [33] and is associated with poor outcomes [34]. Influenza viral replication is initially controlled by innate immunity and thereafter adaptive immune responses (T cells and antibody-producing B cells), lead to viral clearance and host recovery [35]. This may explain the frequent outbreaks of influenza A in Hematology Departments that have occurred over many years [4, 36, 37].Hypoalbuminemia is the result of the combined effect of inflammation and inadequate protein and caloric intake in patients with chronic disease such as chronic renal failure [38]. Hypoalbuminemia is frequently observed in hospitalized patients, therefore early detection of vulnerable individuals is essential for implementation of infection control. While we do not recommend albumin supplementation for patients with hypoalbuminemia for the prevention of influenza A, we recommend that measures such as droplet precautions with single room isolation be mandatory.Pleural effusion, a radiographic finding, can be caused by hypoalbuminemia, pleural infections, heart and kidney failure, pulmonary embolism or malignancy. We did not quantify the amount of effusion or differentiate between single-sided and bilateral effusions, but used it as a qualitative diagnosis. Two studies from Taiwan reported that in pediatric influenza patients, radiographically-confirmed pleural effusion on admission was significantly associated with a severe infection that required intensive care [39, 40]. Having a pleural effusion might make patients more vulnerable to the influenza A virus through an unknown mechanism.There are some limitations to our study. We were not able to meet the requirement for the design that every hospital-acquired influenza A patient should be matched with a ideal control case, who had been hospitalized for 7 days or more in the same room on the date when the paired case acquired influenza. To ensure a sufficient sample size, we were only able to match the same department, but not the same room. This may have reduced the comparability of the two groups. However, two matched patients from the same department were exposed to the same aerosol environment, which played an important role in the spread of the infection. In addition, a relatively stringent definition of hospital-acquired influenza A was adopted, therefore some cases may have been missed and the true risk of acquiring influenza A in the hospital, underestimated. Finally, the clinical data from patients hospitalized for more than 7 days because of severe primary diseases may have exaggerated the impact of hospital-acquired infections, thus the clinical characteristics of hospital-acquired influenza A may be overstated.ConclusionsThis study shows that hospital-acquired influenza A can extend hospital stay and is associated with a high mortality rate; thus, its prevention requires more attention. Precautions need to be taken to protect hospitalized patients who present with lymphocytopenia, hypoalbuminemia, or pleural effusion, due to their increased risk of hospital-acquired influenza A. Further prospective studies with large sample sizes need to be carried out to confirm our findings.

Barry answered questions that covered everything from similarities and differences, his experience advising past presidents, thoughts on how COVID-19 will affect us in the future, and practical advice for college students. The talk was inspired by his best-selling book, The Great Influenza: The Story of the Deadliest Pandemic in History (2004), and is part of the First-Year Programs Common Read. “My colleagues and I are grateful that we were able to have John Barry take part in the Common Read Lecture Series and bring even more context to The Great Influenza and COVID-19 for our students, as well as the campus community,” said Kyle Van Duser, director of UH Mānoaʻs First Year Programs. John Barry (Photo credit: Chris Granger) Revealing lessons “People can handle the truth, but you need to tell it to them,” Barry said in sharing the importance of being candid in messaging from public leaders and the news media, noting it was the biggest mistake in both the 1918 flu and COVID-19. When the 1918 flu outbreak occurred, World War I was nearing its end. However, news media and government leaders suppressed the truth of the flu to avoid affecting public morale. Similarly, he said, the Trump administration downplayed COVID-19 when they learned of the virus in late January 2020. “The result was people were exposed who otherwise would have survived. Many cities ended up doing many of the things we are doing now. If done sooner, it would have saved more lives,” he said. Barry mentioned cities that were hit hardest in 1918 were where people were lied to the most (i.e. Philadelphia). “Society is based on trust. When you break that trust, it’s everybody for himself/herself or their family.” He added, “the major difference in 1918 and now, is from day one, people knew this was not a hoax. It was apparent the virus was very deadly. COVID is a big deal, but not as big as where we were in 1918.” Barry revealed the 1918 flu killed people who were much younger (about 95%), and affected people neurologically (deep fog state) and attacked the lungs. “The immune system has a lot of very deadly weapons. In 1918, the battlefield was the lung. It was destroying the lung to beat the virus. People died of bacterial influenza,” he said. He stressed the importance of mask wearing, saying “Just wearing masks alone by itself will not solve the problem, but is an important piece to solve the problem.” Interestingly, he said masks were not as effective in 1918 because the period of transmission of the virus was different. Barry also compared the relentless pressure in COVID-19, which is adding more stress on society and the economy. He stated while there was more tragedy and deaths from the 1918 flu, it experienced a shorter incubation of 1 to 4 days, where COVID-19’s incubation is stretched out to several weeks, impacting mental health and resulting in issues such as domestic violence and suicide. “I’m asking every day if there is a better way to handle this. It’s very difficult. We’ve handled it so poorly. It’s very difficult to get control of it when the numbers are so large. Take care of the virus and the economy will take care of itself,” he said. Advising public leaders, students Barry described his experience working with the President George W. Bush and Barack Obama administrations as “intellectually challenging and flattering.” Bush, who read Barry’s book, made it a high priority for his administration to create a pandemic plan. Barry was involved in the process. He also served as a backchannel communicator to the Obama administration, providing the White House with data from censored scientists around the world. His advice to President-elect Joe Biden? “Take the advice of public health advisors and get everyone on one page. It’s easier said than done, especially with governors reluctant to do anything. It’s a long grueling fight and you have to maintain discipline every day, or it will come back,” said Barry. The Great Influenza took Barry seven years to write when he intended to complete it in two years. His advice to college students (and aspiring writers) was simple: “Love what you’re getting into. When things aren’t working, you have to figure out, is this something you want to walk away from or is it something you can solve if you persist?” More on Common Read View Barryʻs lecture and other presenters part of the Common Read Lecture Series. Free paperback copies of The Great Influenza are available on a first come first serve basis at Sinclair Library to anyone in the UH community interested in reading the book. The First-Year Programs Common Read advisory reading group is currently accepting book nominations from all UH Mānoa faculty, staff and students (graduate and undergraduate) for the fall 2021 Common Read. Submit book nominations by January 5, 2021. If you would like to integrate future common reads into your course, contact reading@hawaii.edu to participate in the book selection process. “The eagerness of my colleagues from across academic disciplines who participated in this project speaks volumes about the collaborative nature of faculty at UH Mānoa and enhances the exchange of ideas and knowledge, which is what the First Year Programs Common Read seeks to do,” said Van Duser. —By Arlene Abiang Related Posts:Flu vaccination clinic at Kapiʻolani CC draws 100+UH in-person and hybrid courses to resume Monday, January 31In memoriam: Barry Weinman, a life of generosity and impact COVID-19COVID-19 online instructionUH Manoa Share This Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Email COVID-19 UH News COVID-19 stories UH Helps stories Support the UH Student Relief fund and COVID-19 research UH resource page UH travel FAQ Latest UH NewsPandemic newborns in India more likely to have lower birth weightCOVID-era MD graduate’s inspiring journeyStudy on food supply chains of Hawaiʻi, Fiji earns national awardARL at UH provides support for Hawaiʻi during emergenciesJABSOM grad’s COVID-19 study examines insurance, race, vax trendsMost Popular Team of microscopic soft robots could transform medical care UH students launch genki balls to combat Ala Wai water pollution Nana I Ke Kumu exhibit showcases Native Hawaiian artist showcase Featured Video - Hawaiian Pie Co., Kai Spirits among UH alumni ‘makers’ previous post: UH Hilo to hold virtual fall 2020 commencement due to COVID-19 concernsnext post: Hawaiʻi CC culinary arts students help battle hunger Watch the latest news of the University of Hawaiʻi View News Videos 2444 Dole Street Honolulu, HI 96822 An equal opportunity/affirmative action institution Use of this site implies consent with our Usage Policy copyright © 2024 University of Hawaiʻi Twitter Facebook Instagram YouTube LinkedIn Flickr RSS Contact UH If required, information contained on this website can be made available in an alternative format upon request.

Topham2 Show authors Nature Reviews Immunology volume 21, pages 49–64 (2021)Cite this article 29k Accesses 119 Citations 236 Altmetric Metrics details Subjects Influenza virusMolecular medicine AbstractSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Understanding of the fundamental processes underlying the versatile clinical manifestations of COVID-19 is incomplete without comprehension of how different immune cells are recruited to various compartments of virus-infected lungs, and how this recruitment differs among individuals with different levels of disease severity. As in other respiratory infections, leukocyte recruitment to the respiratory system in people with COVID-19 is orchestrated by specific leukocyte trafficking molecules, and when uncontrolled and excessive it results in various pathological complications, both in the lungs and in other organs. In the absence of experimental data from physiologically relevant animal models, our knowledge of the trafficking signals displayed by distinct vascular beds and epithelial cell layers in response to infection by SARS-CoV-2 is still incomplete. However, SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus elicit partially conserved inflammatory responses in the different respiratory epithelial cells encountered early in infection and may trigger partially overlapping combinations of trafficking signals in nearby blood vessels. Here, we review the molecular signals orchestrating leukocyte trafficking to airway and lung compartments during primary pneumotropic influenza virus infections and discuss potential similarities to distinct courses of primary SARS-CoV-2 infections. We also discuss how an imbalance in vascular activation by leukocytes outside the airways and lungs may contribute to extrapulmonary inflammatory complications in subsets of patients with COVID-19. These multiple molecular pathways are potential targets for therapeutic interventions in patients with severe COVID-19.

It comprises distinct epithelial cell layers and vascular beds, including the alveolar gas-exchange surfaces of the lung, which contain the largest vascular bed in the body1. Owing to constant exposure to the environment, there is a risk of acute lung infections, which can quickly develop into life-threatening diseases, especially when they lead to excessive leukocyte recruitment and activation1. The lung harbours different mucosal and alveolar compartments with distinct vascular beds (Figs 1,2). Because of the delicate air–blood barrier for gas exchange, resident immune cells in the lung maintain a very fine balance between protection and disease as they must constantly clear inhaled air particles and rapidly respond to pathogens through the highly coordinated recruitment of specific innate and adaptive leukocytes, which is critical for pathogen clearance.Fig. 1: The main molecular and cellular changes elicited by influenza virus infection of the respiratory system.a | Shown are the major cell types (ciliated epithelial cells, goblet cells and basal cells) that form the epithelial layers of the nasal airway, lower airways and alveoli, which are targeted by respiratory viruses such as influenza virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). An adult human lung contains more than 3 × 108 alveoli, each covered by capillaries. The mediastinal lymph nodes are the major lung-draining lymph nodes. Some cervical lymph nodes and nasal-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT) play an additional role in priming antiviral adaptive immunity against viruses replicating in the upper airways. b | Events triggered by viral infection of the airway epithelial compartment (left) and of the alveolar epithelial compartment that constitute the lung parenchyma (right). The smooth muscle cell layers underneath the airway epithelial monolayers, neuroendocrine cells and the mucus layer on the apical aspects of these cells are omitted for clarity. Viral infection of both types of epithelial compartments triggers the release of inflammatory cytokines. These cytokines activate various epithelial-associated lymphocytes (such as innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) and resident memory T cells (TRM cells)), sentinel cells such as fibroblasts, interstitial macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs), and the pericytes associated with nearby blood vessels. In addition, some of the cytokines produced enter the circulation, reach the bone marrow and trigger generation and mobilization of innate leukocytes such as neutrophils, natural killer (NK) cells and monocytes, which are critical for viral clearance. The various blood vessels near the infected epithelial cells display arrays of leukocyte trafficking molecules (not shown), which are recognized by the circulating bone marrow-mobilized innate leukocytes. These various immune cells can then emigrate to the airway vessels and the capillaries of the virus-infected airway and alveolar compartments (Fig. 2). Virus-infected epithelial cells either die and release viral fragments or release live virus. Both fragments and particles are taken up and are processed by airway (respiratory) and alveolar DCs. On uptake and stimulation by viral particles, these different DCs leave their tissue, enter the lymphatic vessels and migrate into the draining lymph nodes (mediastinal lymph nodes). Naive T cells undergo priming by specific viral antigens in the T cell area of the lymph node, and antigen-activated CD4+ T cells then enter B cell follicles, where they provide critical signals to naive virus antigen-specific B cells, which subsequently become antibody-producing B cells (not shown). Within several days, T cells differentiate into effector T cells and egress from the lymph node, enter the blood vessels and migrate to the site of infection. These T cells are now equipped with specific receptors that allow them to emigrate through the inflamed airway blood vessels and/or the inflamed capillaries.Full size imageFig. 2: Trafficking of leukocytes to resting (left) and influenza virus-infected lungs (right).Leukocyte trafficking is mediated by specific adhesion molecules, chemokines and their respective receptors expressed by leukocytes. Three major vascular beds (postcapillary vessels in the respiratory tract, alveolar capillaries in the lung parenchyma and high endothelial venules (HEVs) in the draining lymph nodes) and their adjacent epithelial cells are indicated. Dashed arrows depict the low-level homeostatic emigration of circulating immune cells through the different types of blood vessel. The vessels are surrounded by basement membrane and pericytes. Other sentinel cells depicted in Fig. 1 are omitted. Top panel: in the resting state, endothelial cells of postcapillary vessels near the lower airways constitutively express integrin ligands (VCAM1 and ICAM2) and present homeostatic chemokines (CCL17, CCL20, CCL22 and CXCL16) in gradients across the vessels and epithelial cell layers. These trafficking signals mainly promote the low-level entry of leukocyte precursors (for example, precursor dendritic cells (preDCs)) and regulatory T cells (Treg cells). On viral infection, the inducible expression of trafficking molecules such as endothelial selectins (E-selectin and P-selectin), pro-inflammatory chemokines such as CCL2, CCL5, CXCL1, CXCL9 and CXCL10, and de novo transcribed ICAM1, together with VCAM1 and ICAM2, triggers massive emigration (thick arrows) of various innate immune cells (such as neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes) and natural killer (NK) cells from blood towards the infected airways. During later stages of infection, virus-specific CD8+ and CD4+ effector T cells (not shown) enter these infected compartments. Homeostatic chemokines (such as CXCL16) allow recruited CD8+ effector T cells to differentiate into epithelial-associated resident memory T cells (TRM cells). Uncontrolled viral spread or dysregulated epithelial and endothelial cell activation results in destructive leukocyte recruitment. During infection, resident innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) and TRM cells proliferate, and DCs carrying viral antigens either enter lymphatic vessels or stay in the inflamed tissue, where they present viral antigens to recruited effector T cells. Unresolved infection gives rise to inducible bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue, which recruits naive and effector T and B cells through HEVs (not shown). Middle panel: in the resting state, distinct integrin ligands, such as ICAM1, are constitutively expressed by resting endothelial cells that line the pulmonary capillaries in the lung parenchyma. Various homeostatic chemokines (such as CCL17, CCL22 and CXCL16) are secreted by nearby alveolar epithelial cells and endothelial cells that line the capillaries, and these chemokines promote the low-level entry of Treg cells and leukocyte precursors such as preDCs (not shown). In addition, patrolling monocytes crawl on all these endothelial cells using endothelial ICAM1 and remove dying endothelial cells. Alveolar macrophages are attached to the epithelial cells that constitute individual alveoli and capture airborne particles without eliciting inflammation. Just like in the respiratory tract, on viral infection, the emigration of multiple types of immune cell towards the infected alveolus is guided by enhanced expression of chemokines. These are produced primarily by individual infected epithelial cells and by virus-infected alveolar macrophages. Myeloid leukocytes may use their integrin macrophage 1 antigen (MAC1) to attach to and crawl along inflamed capillaries by as yet unidentified ligands. Bottom panel: constitutive expression of integrin ligands (not shown) on the endothelial cells lining specialized lymph node blood vessels called HEVs and the chemokines displayed by these cells, such as CCL19, CCL21, CXCL12 and CXCL13, allows the constant entry of recirculating naive T and B lymphocytes into lung-draining lymph nodes. On viral infection, in addition to naive lymphocytes, NK cells and specific myeloid leukocytes can emigrate from the HEVs, responding to signals from inflammatory chemokines such as CCL2, CXCL9 and CXCL10 displayed on these venules in an inducible manner in addition to the constitutively displayed chemokines CCL19, CXCL12 and CXCL13. For more details on individual trafficking molecules used by these different leukocytes to cross each of these vascular beds, please refer to Table 2.

Adapted from ref.1, Springer Nature Limited.Full size imageThe key targets for viral infections are the bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells, which are constantly exposed to air irritants and pathogens. Infected epithelial cells produce a number of inflammatory mediators, thereby orchestrating an immune response that involves multiple cell types critical for viral clearance and the establishment of antiviral immune memory. During infections with highly pathogenic viruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or pneumotropic influenza viruses (for example, certain H1N1 and H5N1 influenza virus strains), a failure to rapidly clear these infections can lead to excessive uncontrolled inflammation, resulting in lung injury. Influenza viruses and SARS-CoV-2 use different molecular targets for entry and spread to the airways and lungs (Table 1; Box 1), and do not induce identical antiviral responses in the epithelial cells they infect2. Consequently, different influenza virus strains and SARS-CoV-2 evoke distinct inflammatory programmes during their spread in the airways and lungs. In particular, there is a difference with regard to the induction of type I and type III interferons by the epithelial cells that are initially infected. SARS-CoV-2 was reported to interfere more efficiently than influenza viruses with various cellular translation machineries implicated in antiviral immunity3,4,5. Nevertheless, given the conserved nature of antiviral responses, during the progression of SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially in patients with severe disease, most of the cytokines implicated in innate and adaptive leukocyte trafficking to sites of viral infection are likely similar to those elicited by influenza virus infections, and in particular to those induced in response to pneumotropic influenza virus strains that are able to replicate both in the lower airways and in the alveoli6,7 (Table 1). However, if SARS-CoV-2 is not efficiently cleared from the respiratory system, and in sharp contrast to influenza virus, it can spread to other organs (Table 1) using diverse mechanisms of extrapulmonary spread and resulting in a variety of clinical manifestations8.Table 1 Comparison of shared and unique mechanisms, molecules and cells in human influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2 infectionsFull size tableIn the absence of protective vaccines, therapeutic interventions should aim to optimize beneficial antiviral responses while restraining uncontrolled leukocyte trafficking, inflammation and injury associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections. Excessive pulmonary infiltration of monocyte-derived macrophages secreting enhanced levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines is a hallmark of severe pneumonia induced by SARS-CoV-2 (ref.9). How these leukocytes and other immune cells are recruited to various compartments of virus-infected airways and lungs at different stages of infection, which leukocyte trafficking molecules orchestrate this recruitment and how excessive accumulation of specific leukocyte subsets results in pathological complications in a subset of patients are still incompletely understood, as we lack key experimental data on leukocyte trafficking in SARS-CoV-2 infection in physiologically relevant animal models.Here, we review our current knowledge of the molecular basis of immune cell migration and function in distinct airway and lung compartments in infections, with a specific focus on pathogenic influenza viruses, in an attempt to draw, wherever relevant, parallels to initial observations thus far reported in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We discuss how the intricate communication between influenza virus, epithelial cells, vascular cells, stromal cells, resident immune cells and circulating immune cells can regulate various leukocyte recruitment processes, and how parallel processes may occur during SARS-CoV-2 infections. We also highlight the involvement of specific vascular changes and the expression of leukocyte trafficking molecules in the thromboinflammatory processes associated with extrapulmonary SARS-CoV-2 complications. A discussion of classical studies on leukocyte recruitment to bacteria-infected or lipopolysaccharide-treated lungs is not included, as these are beyond the scope of this Perspective.Box 1 Molecular targets of influenza viruses and coronavirusesInfluenza virusesInfluenza viruses utilize the carbohydrate-binding protein haemagglutinin (HA) for binding to, fusing to and entering target cells, and the enzyme neuraminidase (NA) to cleave the glycosidic bonds of terminal sialic acid (neuraminic acid) moieties present on most plasma membrane glycoproteins to mediate attachment and release184. Most seasonal influenza virus infections occur in the larger airways, trachea and nasopharynx, and these viruses are termed ‘bronchotropic’. The exceptions are the highly pathogenic and generally pneumotropic influenza A virus strains such as 1918 H1N1, H5N1 and H7 viruses, which replicate deep in the lung airways and alveoli. The 2009 H1N1 virus is also pneumotropic but less pathogenic owing to characteristics of the virus as well as pre-existing cross-reactive immunity in most people185. The distribution of sialic acids on cell surfaces is the primary determinant of the tropism of the influenza virus, and the pattern of linkage of these sialic acids to glycans on the surface of target cells has a significant impact on the ability of the influenza virus virion to attach to a target cell and initiate a viral infection186. α2,3- or α2,6-linked sialic acids have different distributions within different regions of the human respiratory tract, and between different animal species. The lack of significant amounts of α2,3-linked sialic acid in the upper respiratory tract is an important restrictive factor for influenza virus infection in humans, limiting infections to α2,6 tropic viruses185. Other factors dictating the location and spread of influenza virus infection are the gross anatomy of the host, the composition of the mucus present on the upper and lower airway epithelial cell lining, the density of HA/NA on the viral envelope and viral morphology (Table 1). The oropharynx is usually the first site of influenza virus infection187. It is widely accepted that airborne transmission of the H1N1 and H3N2 influenza virus subtypes is almost exclusively mediated through viral particle spread from the upper respiratory tract, rather than viral particles originating from the lower respiratory tract155,187, thereby explaining why H5N1 viruses, which replicate primarily inside the lungs and not in the upper respiratory tract, rarely transmit from person to person.CoronavirusesCoronaviruses are widespread and cause a broad range of respiratory diseases in humans and animals. The vast majority of these viruses typically infect the upper respiratory tract, but three of them, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2, also replicate in the lower respiratory tract in humans. SARS-CoV-2 infectivity depends primarily on the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the host cell, and of proteases such as furin, TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L, which facilitate viral entry188. The expression of these cofactors determines susceptibility to infection, and may vary with age, sex and co-morbidities such as metabolic diseases188. Notably, nasal epithelial cells, including goblet and ciliated cell subsets, show the highest ACE2 expression among all investigated cell types in the respiratory tract166 (Table 1). However, SARS-CoV-2 also infects ciliated, mucus-secreting and club cells of the bronchial epithelium, as well as type 2 pneumocytes (Fig. 1). The high infectivity and spread of SARS-CoV-2 along the airways is enabled by the particularly high affinity of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein for ACE2 (refs158,159). SARS-CoV, unlike SARS-CoV-2, does not spread past the lung as successful SARS-CoV infection depends on the presence of TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L, proteins that are restricted to the respiratory system. By contrast, SARS-CoV-2 infection via ACE2 depends on the presence of furin, which is ubiquitously expressed in endothelial cells and in other target cells188.Trafficking signals on distinct vesselsLeukocyte trafficking from the blood to both the resting and pathogen-infected respiratory tract occurs through three major types of blood vessel: the postcapillary venules in the trachea and other blood vessels along the bronchial tree, the alveolar capillaries in the lung parenchyma, and the specialized cuboidal postcapillary venules within draining lymph nodes (LNs) termed ‘high endothelial venules’ (HEVs), which are the main portal for the entry of circulating naive and memory lymphocytes into LNs (Figs 1,2). These vessels are lined with endothelial cells, which sit at the interface between blood and tissues and contribute to haemostasis, immunity and inflammatory reactions10,11 (Fig. 1). Canonical inflammatory cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF), IL-1β and interferons, which are secreted by virus-infected epithelial and stromal cells, act directly on these various blood vessels and alveolar capillaries to induce the de novo expression of an array of leukocyte trafficking molecules on the surface of endothelial cells (Tables 1,2). These molecules function in a temporally regulated manner to recruit both innate and adaptive leukocytes to the infected airways and lungs. By contrast, endothelial cells of HEVs express distinct arrays of leukocyte trafficking molecules in a largely constitutive manner12.Table 2 Trafficking molecules involved in leukocyte recruitment to influenza virus-infected lungsaFull size tableTo exit these different vessels, leukocytes that have penetrated the endothelial layers lining these vessels must cross the vascular basement membrane and a discontinuous pericyte layer (Fig. 2), and then follow chemotactic cues to reach their final destination (such as infected epithelial cells or different LN compartments). The basement membrane is a dense but discontinuous barrier composed of collagen IV, specialized laminin isoforms and interconnected proteoglycans13. Some of these glycoproteins are decorated with heparan sulfate moieties that serve as scaffolds on which chemokines, locally produced by inflamed blood vessels, pericytes and perivascular immune cells, become immobilized at high local concentrations14. As observed for other tissues, the basement membrane and the different interstitial tissues surrounding the distinct pulmonary vascular beds are likely remodelled during inflammation15. The proteolytic and actomyosin machineries used by individual leukocytes to cross these extravascular barriers under inflammatory settings are still poorly understood, especially in the context of viral lung infections.Postcapillary venulesTracheal and bronchial postcapillary venules and other blood vessels surround the bronchial tree and support leukocyte recruitment into the various airways following infection16,17. As very little is known about the transcriptional changes experienced by the endothelial cells that constitute these various blood vessels during viral infections, it is still unknown whether the main molecular changes induced in these vessels in response to pulmonary influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2 infections are similar. As in other tissues, in response to multiple inflammatory cues, these vessels are thought to mediate sequential multistep adhesive cascades initiated by leukocyte capture under shear flow, followed by rolling and firm arrest18. In the steady state, the endothelial cells of these various vessels express the cell adhesion molecules VCAM1 and ICAM2, which bind to the integrins very late antigen 4 (VLA4) and lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA1), respectively, but they can undergo rapid transcriptional changes in response to distinct inflammatory cytokines to express additional cell adhesion molecules19 (Table 1). These include endothelial selectins and their glycoprotein ligands20, which mediate the initial capture and rolling of various blood-borne leukocytes on these vessels under shear flow (Table 2), and ICAM1, the high-affinity ligand for the integrins LFA1 and macrophage 1 antigen (MAC1)18, which together with VCAM1 mediate the arrest of rolling leukocyte on the inflamed vessels (Table 2). In response to different combinations of inflammatory cytokines (Table 1), the endothelial cells and their main perivascular counterparts, pericytes (Fig. 2), also express a large array of chemokines (for example, CXCL1, CXCL8, CCL2, CCL5 and the interferon-stimulated chemokines CXCL9, CXCL10 and CXC11), additional lipid mediators such as platelet-activating factor and leukotriene B4, and complement factors such as C5a21 (see Box 2). During infection, these endothelial cells and their associated pericytes, as well as virus-infected epithelial cells, can also produce the cytokines granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and IL-3, which act systemically and enhance myelopoiesis and the mobilization of newly generated myeloid leukocytes in the bone marrow22 (Fig. 1). These vessels can also rapidly mobilize Weibel–Palade bodies containing prestored von Willebrand factor, the chemokine CXCL8 (in humans) and the cell adhesion molecule P-selectin in response to various acute injury signals such as thrombin11,23. Another specialized property of postcapillary venules is the restricted expression of atypical chemokine receptor 1 (ACKR1; A. Rot, personal communication). On the basis of its functions in other tissues, this unique chemokine transcytosis receptor is likely to function in chemokine mobilization and presentation selectively in peribronchial postcapillary venules24,25,26, but its contribution to leukocyte recruitment to airways infected with influenza virus is still unknown. Other atypical chemoattractant receptors (such as the C5a receptor C5AR2 (ref.27)) may also contribute to leukocyte extravasation in influenza and other pulmonary infections.Given that SARS-CoV-2 can initially attenuate antiviral type I and type III interferon production in infected epithelial cells4,5,28, the precise combinations of the multiple inflammatory endothelial stimuli triggered by this virus, as opposed to distinct pathogenic influenza virus strains, are likely different. Furthermore, the leukocyte trafficking signals and permeability changes induced in distinct blood vessels and postcapillary venules during different stages of viral infection and clearance (Box 3) are likely to differ between different respiratory compartments (for example, upper airways and lower airways) owing to differences in epithelial cell composition, relative infection levels and the types of cytokine produced (Fig. 1). In addition, the composition of perivascular and interstitial sentinel cells (such as pericytes, perivascular immune cells such as dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages, fibroblasts, innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) and regulatory T cells (Treg cells)) in different virus-infected airway compartments and their individual responses to virus-triggered inflammatory cytokines may also affect the composition of leukocyte trafficking signals induced on the blood vessels near which they reside.Box 2 Complement in lung injuryA key pathological axis involved in lung injury associated with primary viral infections is the complement system, which forms an integral component of the innate immune response to viruses. It promotes both leukocyte emigration from the blood and dendritic cell migration into lung-draining lymph nodes189. Complement pathways lead to the release of the peptides C3a, C4a and C5a and ultimately the generation of the membrane attack complex (C5b–C9). In severe influenza virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections, components of the lectin and alternative complement pathways can induce excess detrimental inflammation190, and therapeutic targeting of these complement components can potentially improve outcomes of infection191. It was recently shown that C3, released from platelets containing influenza virus particles, may affect NETosis (Fig. 3) and myeloperoxidase release192. Furthermore, the development of thrombotic microvascular injury in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (Fig. 3) was shown to be facilitated by the terminal components of the complement cascade, C5b–C9 (ref.193). Preclinical studies in influenza virus infections suggested that targeting specific components of the complement pathways may be beneficial. For instance, in a mouse model of H5N1 influenza virus infection, an antagonist of C3a receptor was shown to limit acute lung injury and improve survival without compromising viral clearance194. Similarly, blocking the neutrophil chemotactic complement component C5a in primates infected with H7N9 influenza virus limited acute lung damage194. Specific targeting of C5a with a monoclonal antibody was also shown to decrease the lung infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages in patients with severe avian influenza194. It was recently reported that inhibition of C5a is also of benefit in a cohort of patients with COVID-19 with complement hyperactivation195.Box 3 Vascular permeability changes in infectionIncreased vascular permeability is one of the major hallmarks of virus-induced acute lung injury68,69. Endothelial barrier properties are tightly controlled by junctional complexes, which include adherens junctions, tight junctions and gap junctions23. Adherens junctions are composed of vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin) assemblies196. Disrupting these multimeric VE-cadherin assemblies via redistribution, internalization, weakening of VE-cadherin tail interactions with the endothelial cortical cytoskeleton or via proteolytic shedding leads to dramatic changes in vascular permeability196. The barrier properties of these endothelial cells as well as those of other vascular beds susceptible to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections can be rapidly disrupted by a rise in intracellular calcium concentration induced by thrombin, released by activated platelets and platelet–neutrophil aggregates (Fig. 3 and reviewed in ref.23). Reactive oxygen species, locally secreted by these aggregates or by entrapped neutrophils70, can also increase vascular permeability. In addition, in severe influenza virus infection and likely also in SARS-CoV-2 infection, VEGF197, tumour necrosis factor (TNF), IL-1β, NO and bradykinin, secreted by infected epithelial cells, by the endothelial cells lining the pulmonary vessels (primarily capillaries) and by both resident and recruited leukocytes71, may each increase lung vessel permeability and injury by reducing the integrity of VE-cadherin assemblies and driving endothelial contractility (reviewed in refs23,198).Alveolar capillariesA second class of blood vessels that support leukocyte recruitment to the lung parenchyma are the alveolar capillaries29 (Fig. 2; Table 2). The endothelial lining of these alveolar capillaries is structurally distinct from that of postcapillary venules30. The transition from arterial to capillary endothelial cells is reflected in an elongation and flattening of the endothelial cell lining to improve gas exchange. Pulmonary capillaries also demonstrate lower permeability to solutes and fluids than the larger pulmonary blood vessels30. Alveolar capillaries have smaller diameters than leukocytes, a constraint which leads to a slow transit time31. These capillaries therefore contain a large number of marginated neutrophils, monocytes and naive and memory T cells that can rapidly cross the endothelium in response to chemotactic cues released within individual alveoli1. Most notably, leukocyte emigration through these narrow vessels and into the alveolar space occurs in the absence of selectin-mediated rolling29. Furthermore, the endothelial cells lining these vessels lack Weibel–Palade bodies; however, they express P-selectin and von Willebrand factor11 (Table 2).Endothelial cells of alveolar capillaries express constitutively high levels of ICAM1 as well as ICAM2, a low-affinity ligand of LFA1. However, as opposed to postcapillary venules, they do not express VCAM1 or ACKR1 (refs19,32) (A. Rot, personal communication). The functions of these vascular ICAMs in leukocyte recruitment to influenza virus-infected alveoli are still unclear. Patrolling monocytes, a specialized subset of housekeeping monocytes that express constitutively activated LFA1, interact with vascular ICAM1 and ICAM2, which enable these cells to bind to damaged blood vessels in multiple organs33. It is therefore likely that these monocytes use ICAM1 and ICAM2 to patrol alveolar capillaries for signs of damage. The role of these ligands (and of other potential CD18 integrin ligands) in neutrophil emigration from inflamed capillaries, in general, and in influenza virus-infected mice, in particular, is still disputed34. Notably, ICAM1 is also constitutively expressed by alveolar type 1 pneumocytes19. However, the function of this pool of epithelial ICAM1 in guiding leukocytes to enter influenza virus-infected alveolar compartments remains unclear. Rather than promoting transepithelial leukocyte crossing, alveolar epithelial ICAM1 may facilitate cytotoxic T lymphocyte-mediated and natural killer (NK) cell-mediated killing of influenza virus-infected alveolar epithelial cells35.High endothelial venulesHEVs are the third class of specialized blood vessels12 (Fig. 2). These serve as the main portal for naive T and B lymphocytes as well as central memory lymphocytes, recirculating neutrophils and ILCs36,37 to enter the draining LNs of the lung and specialized tertiary lymphoid organs along the bronchial tree38. The main draining LNs of the lungs are mediastinal LNs, which are positioned along the lower airways (Fig. 1). In addition, cervical LNs drain parts of the upper airways and are implicated in virus-specific T cell priming in mouse models of influenza virus and parainfluenza virus infections39 and potentially also in immune reactions to SARS-CoV-2. In addition to HEVs and their surrounding pericytes (Fig. 2), the two predominant stromal cell types in all draining LNs are lymphatic endothelial cells and fibroblastic reticular cells40. Lymphatic endothelial cells control lymphocyte egress and facilitate the entry of antigen-bearing DCs and soluble antigens into LNs. Fibroblastic reticular cells form a complex conduit system of microchannels and coordinate the entry and motility of lymphocytes through the LN41. Fibroblastic reticular cells also express homeostatic chemokines, including CXCL13, CCL19 and CCL21, as well as key integrin ligands, such as VCAM1 and ICAM1 (ref.42).Another secondary lymphoid tissue in the respiratory system is the nasopharyngeal cavity (nasal)-associated lymphoid tissue. Prolonged infection in mice and humans induces the generation of additional bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue. The key leukocyte trafficking molecules expressed by the different HEVs within mediastinal LNs, nasal-associated lymphoid tissue and inducible bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue include a group of constitutively expressed glycoprotein ligands for L-selectin (also known as CD62L), which capture lymphocytes and subsets of monocytes and allow them to roll on the HEV surface in search of stop signals43,44. The LFA1 integrin ligands ICAM1 and ICAM2 are critical for lymphocyte arrest on all LN HEVs45 (Table 2). Notably, VCAM1 is particularly enriched on HEVs of human inducible bronchus-associated lymphoid tissues and may contribute to the recruitment of memory T and B cells to these lymphoid tissues during late stages of influenza virus infections46. Naive T and B lymphocytes require the chemokine receptor CCR7 to transmit critical intracellular signals that change the conformation of their LFA1 into a functional state in order to allow these cells to stop on HEVs and cross these vessels47. The main chemokine ligand for CCR7, CCL21, is displayed on both the luminal and the basolateral aspects of HEVs48. Under strong inflammatory conditions, HEVs can express or present additional adhesive and chemokine signals, which recruit subsets of regulatory NK cells and inflammatory monocytes49,50,51. During various infections, inflammatory monocytes are recruited to inflamed HEVs via specific CCR2-binding chemokines that are displayed by the endothelial cells of the HEVs50,51. As inflammatory monocytes express L-selectin and LFA1, but lack CCR7, they are normally restricted from homing to resting LNs. The CCR2-binding chemokines and additional inflammatory chemokines produced by various cells in the infected LNs (for example, CXCR3 ligands49) may be transported to HEVs through the LN conduits52. In addition to recruiting monocytes and NK cells, CXCR3 ligands displayed on inflamed HEVs can also promote the recruitment of plasmacytoid DCs with high CXCR3 expression (Table 2). Viral infections may also induce the expression of endothelial selectins (P-selectin and E-selectin) that function independently of L-selectin in recruiting these plasmacytoid DCs and NK cells to the inflamed HEVs49,53. So far, these molecular changes have been shown for HEVs within peripheral LNs but are likely shared with HEVs of lung-draining LNs.Leukocytes recruited to infected lungsThe initial innate immune response to respiratory infections orchestrates the generation of adaptive immunity and facilitates the recruitment of various immune cell subsets. In the following subsections, we discuss the trafficking of these immune cells across distinct vascular beds and lymphatic vessels in influenza virus infections and, where known, in SARS-CoV-2 infections. We also briefly discuss the potential contributions of these leukocyte subsets to either productive or dysregulated immune responses, as well as to the resolution of viral infection-induced lung injury.Neutrophil trafficking and vascular damageNeutrophils, monocytes and NK cells are among the first innate immune cells to be recruited to the lung following viral infections. In influenza virus infections, neutrophils may promote clearance, or aggravate pathology, via a feedforward inflammatory circuit54,55. The cytokine G-CSF and the chemokine CXCL4, which are produced by multiple types of epithelial and endothelial cells of influenza virus-infected lungs, promote neutrophil mobilization from the bone marrow to the inflamed lung56,57. Several other neutrophil-recruiting chemokines are released by influenza virus-infected epithelial cells, alveolar macrophages and interstitial macrophages (Fig. 2), including CXCL1 (mice and humans), CXCL8 (also known as IL-8) (humans), CXCL2 and CCL3 (mice and humans)58. Neutrophil recruitment is also enhanced by platelets, which bind to and tether activated neutrophils to inflamed blood vessels59 (Fig. 3). Once they breach the endothelial lining of different blood vessels, neutrophils secrete matrix metallopeptidases and elastase, which cleave type IV collagen within the endothelial basement membranes of these various vessels60. In the interstitium, neutrophils are rapidly recruited to the bronchoalveolar space following chemokine gradients that are assumed to be generated across these various epithelial barriers during viral infections such as influenza or COVID-19 (ref.61).Fig. 3: Involvement of endothelial and leukocyte trafficking molecules in the vascular pathophysiology of COVID-19 in the lungs and other organs.a | Dysregulation of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) as a consequence of the downregulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) by viral binding leads to decreased cleavage of angiotensin I and angiotensin II, resulting in elevated vasoconstriction and increased vascular permeability. Viral binding also results in endothelial cell damage, endothelial cell activation and thromboinflammation. b | Thromboinflammation in blood vessels is driven by the activation of endothelial cells and blood monocytes, which increase tissue factor membrane expression. Tissue factor is a key driver of thrombin generation. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-infected or damaged endothelial cells, as well as endothelial cells stimulated by systemic or locally produced cytokines, upregulate the expression of adhesion molecules such as ICAM1 and of monocyte and neutrophil chemoattractants such as CXCL1 (not shown) and CCL2. The binding of thrombin to endothelial receptors (not shown) mobilizes vesicles containing prestored P-selectin and von Willebrand factor (vWF) (not shown), which, in turn, facilitate the recruitment of neutrophils and bind to and activate circulating platelets, respectively. The endothelial cell damage induced by the virus also exposes endothelial tissue factor, which further amplifies platelet deposition and thrombus formation. Moreover, monocytes and neutrophils are recruited to the damaged vessels by deposited platelets. Monocyte-derived tissue factor-rich microvesicles also activate the extrinsic coagulation pathway. Neutrophils recruited by the damaged endothelial cells and platelets can release neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which activate the intrinsic (contact activation) coagulation pathway, leading to massive fibrin deposition and blood clotting. Both neutrophils and monocytes express the integrin macrophage 1 antigen (MAC1), which allows them to bind to the damaged endothelial cells, activated platelets and deposited fibrin. COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019. Adapted from ref.8 and ref.65, Springer Nature Limited.Full size imageImportant viral clearance mechanisms of neutrophils include the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, the phagocytosis of dying virus-infected epithelial cells and macrophages, and the release of granular content, including cationic antimicrobial peptides such as defensins and cathelicidins62. Neutrophils entrapped inside inflamed pulmonary vessels can produce neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in a process termed ‘NETosis’, and these are thought to capture viral particles and thereby restrict viral dissemination63. However, NETosis can also aggravate damage to the pulmonary endothelia and epithelia in severe influenza-induced pneumonia64. NETs also activate the extrinsic and intrinsic coagulation pathways65 (Fig. 3). Pro-NETotic states, reflected in elevated serum levels of myeloperoxidase (MPO)–DNA and of citrullinated histone H3, were recently reported in patients with severe COVID-19 (ref.66). In some settings, neutrophils can also secrete large amounts of CCL2, promoting monocyte recruitment67. Thus, elevated recruitment and activation of neutrophils can promote acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome, which are the main complications of severe influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2 infections68,69. These conditions are characterized by increased permeability of lung capillaries and the entry of solutes and fluids into the alveolar lumen70 (Box 3). In addition to increasing pulmonary oedema and facilitating leukocyte emigration, elevated vascular permeability may potentially facilitate SARS-CoV-2 dissemination to the circulation71.Monocyte trafficking and pathologiesIn humans, three circulating monocyte subsets have been classified on the basis of relative expression levels of CD14 and CD16 (also known as FcγRIII): classical (more than 80% of circulating monocytes), intermediate (about 15% of circulating monocytes) and non-classical (less than 5% of circulating monocytes) monocyte subsets72. The last subset, also termed ‘patrolling monocytes’33, is long-lived. Through the expression of their constitutively active LFA1, these cells bind to ICAM1 and ICAM2, which are constitutively expressed by the endothelial cells of different blood vessels, including capillaries. This binding allows patrolling monocytes to ‘crawl’ along these endothelial cells and detect signs of injury without emigrating to blood vessels (Table 2). By contrast, classical and intermediate monocytes are guided by endothelial selectins, multiple inflammatory chemokines and integrin ligands to emigrate to inflamed blood vessels within different lung compartments during different phases of influenza virus infection (Table 2). These recruited monocytes may also facilitate neutrophil extravasation across the inflamed alveolar capillaries73. Inflammatory monocytes that infiltrate the lung undergo differentiation into either monocyte-derived DCs or ‘exudate macrophages’, which release a large array of inflammatory chemokines (for example, CXCR3 ligands) as well as type I interferons74,75. A hallmark of severe influenza virus infections, which has also been reported in patients with severe COVID-19, is the CCR2-mediated exit (mobilization) of these various monocyte subsets from the bone marrow76. A fraction of these inflammatory monocytes replace the tissue-resident alveolar macrophages, which normally constitute 90% of the total lung macrophages1 and normally die during early phases of SARS-CoV-2 infection9. During influenza virus infection, alveolar macrophages and inflammatory monocytes contribute to the progressive clearance of the virus via Fc receptor-mediated antibody-derived cellular phagocytosis of infected cells65,77. However, pro-inflammatory monocyte-derived macrophages (M1 macrophages) can also contribute to pulmonary damage by secreting elevated levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase, TNF, IL-6 and matrix metallopeptidases65. Similar mechanisms may occur in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, as this is often associated with a cytokine storm78 and the excessive recruitment of IL-6-producing monocytes to infected lungs65. Systemic levels of IL-6 also appear to be directly correlated with the severity of COVID-19 (ref.2). There is also concern that macrophages may become infected with SARS-CoV-2 through antibody-dependent enhancement, a phenomenon where the uptake of virus is facilitated by non-neutralizing antibodies that bind to Fc receptors on macrophages79. However, the relevance of antibody-dependent enhancement for SARS-CoV-2 pathologies, especially during a primary infection, remains unclear80.NK cell trafficking and functionsCirculating CD19−CD3−CD56+ NK cells are recruited to the inflamed lung early during influenza virus infection81. There is a well-documented division of labour within the NK cell compartment. CD56low NK cells express high levels of CD16 and killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors82, conferring them with the ability to lyse infected cells via their activating receptors NKp44 and NKp46, which can directly bind to the glycoprotein haemagglutinin (HA) on the surface of influenza viruses83 (Box 1). CD56hi NK cells, which lack these receptors, perform regulatory functions by secreting cytokines and chemokines on stimulation by IL-18, which is secreted by epithelial cells, and IL-12, which is secreted by DCs84. The cytotoxic CD56low NK cell subtype and the regulatory CD56hi NK cell subtype express similar sets of chemokine receptors58 (Table 2). In addition, IL-15, produced by influenza virus-infected lung airways85, is chemotactic for most NK cells86. A potential direct contribution of regulatory NK cells to influenza virus-associated and SARS-CoV-2-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome is still unclear, but a subset of these regulatory NK cells produces CXCL1 and CXCL2 and enhances pulmonary neutrophil recruitment. Given that lung-recruited monocytes produce large amounts of the CXCR3-binding chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL10 (ref.9), NK cells responding to these chemokines can orchestrate additional monocyte and neutrophil accumulation, which can further worsen the lung injury87. Similarly to what is observed in patients infected with influenza A virus subtype H1N1, NK cell cytopenia in the blood, coupled with enhanced infiltration of NK cells into the inflamed bronchoalveolar space, appears to directly correlate with COVID-19 severity88. Although there are other similarities with influenza virus infections, the beneficial versus pathological contribution of different NK cell subsets during severe SARS-CoV-2 infections and the precise combinations of trafficking molecules used by these cells to accumulate in infected lungs await further elucidation.Innate lymphocytes in lungs and LNsILCs, which include the NK-cell related ILC1, ILC2 and ILC3 subsets, are early producers of interferon-γ, IL-13 and IL-17, respectively, and have been implicated in various immune responses in lung infections and asthma89. In influenza virus infections, ILCs play versatile roles, including in viral immunosurveillance and repair of lung damage90. ILC1, ILC2 and ILC3 are primarily tissue resident both in lymphoid organs and in non-lymphoid organs, as they originate in situ from tissue progenitors91. At later stages of infection, however, haematogenous replacement of tissue ILCs has been shown to play an important role in ILC homeostasis91. For instance, the ILC1 and ILC2 subsets released from the bone marrow can migrate into inflamed lungs and also recirculate through resting and inflamed LNs91. The trafficking signals used by these different ILCs to enter influenza virus-infected lung and lung-draining LNs are still largely unknown (Table 2).DC trafficking during influenza virus infectionThe infected respiratory tract and its draining LNs are the main sites of initiation of T cell responses following the capture of viral antigens by respiratory DCs or by LN macrophages74. During influenza virus infections, and likely also during SARS-CoV-2 infection, airway and interstitial DCs play an essential role in mounting protective antiviral CD8+ T cell responses and in controlling the degree of inflammation93. The DC network in the respiratory tract is composed of several subsets that differ in phenotype, anatomical distribution and function (reviewed in refs92,93). The major resident DC subsets in the normal (non-inflamed) murine lung are respiratory conventional DCs (cDCs) and alveolar DCs. Virus-infected human and murine lungs are enriched with additional DC subsets derived from monocytes or from precursors of cDCs. Precursor DCs are recruited to the infected respiratory tract from the bone marrow in response to CCR2 chemokines released into the circulation (Fig. 1). Epithelial cells that are infected by influenza virus produce additional DC-activating cytokines such as IL-1β, GM-CSF and IL-3. By releasing various pathogen-associated molecular patterns and damage-associated molecular patterns, they facilitate DC differentiation and maturation92. The binding of natural or cross-reactive antibodies to influenza virus particles also leads to the formation of immune complexes that can drive DC maturation94. Whether such immune complexes also occur in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection is questionable as cross-reactive antibodies are rare95.The acquisition of influenza virus antigens by cDCs is achieved mainly by phagocytic engulfment of cell-free virions or of dying/dead infected epithelial cells that contain viral antigens96, and these highly conserved mechanisms are likely shared during SARS-CoV-2 infections. In mouse models, the clearance of influenza virus from the lung has been shown to depend on migratory langerin-positive CD103+CD11b− DCs, which need to upregulate CCR7 in order to egress from the bronchial tissues and enter draining LNs92,94. DCs may also use lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronic acid receptor 1 (LYVE1) to migrate through lymphatic vessels enriched with hyaluronan as shown in a mouse skin contact hypersensitivity model97. During early phases of influenza virus infection, migratory DCs are transported into the subcapsular sinus of draining LNs via afferent lymphatic vessels, gain access to the LN parenchyma and enter the T cell paracortex of the mediastinal LN58,98. Although DCs are critical for the priming of both CD8+ and CD4+ T cells in all known viral infections92,93, in the late stages of infections, cross-reactive memory B cells that had been generated in response to previous infections enter infected mediastinal LNs via HEVs and also participate in antigen presentation to CD4+ T cells39. Although studies are still lacking, it is very likely that in primary SARS-CoV-2 infections this pathway is limited as SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive memory B cells are rare in naive individuals99.T cell trafficking to sites of infectionThe clearance of a primary infection with pneumotropic influenza viruses and likely of SARS-CoV-2 infection requires potent cytotoxic CD8+ T cell responses100,101. In addition, there appear to be contributions to viral clearance from subsets of CD4+ T cells (most clearly identified in patients with influenza) that acquire cytotoxic functions and are generated from naive and central memory virus-specific CD4+ T cell clones102,103. The various effector T cells generated in mediastinal and other respiratory LNs (Fig. 1) egress from these LNs through the efferent lymphatic vessels in response to signals from the sphingolipid S1P, which is constitutively expressed by these vessels104, and return to the blood. They accumulate in the airways and the lung parenchyma in response to combinations of distinct trafficking signals expressed by airway and alveolar blood vessel endothelial cells (Table 2). As these T cells downregulate their LN homing receptors (for example, CCR7 and L-selectin) and upregulate LFA1 and VLA4, and chemokine receptors recognized by ligands presented on the airway blood vessels and alveolar capillaries, these effector T cells can readily emigrate from these vessels rather than returning to lung-draining LNs (Fig.2; Table 2). Notably, influenza virus antigens can also be transferred from the lung to the spleen and bone marrow, where they are presented by various antigen-presenting cells and elicit CD4+ and CD8+ T cell priming and differentiation105. These effector T cells can also return to the circulation and home to vessels near the various infected airways. Whether SARS-CoV-2 antigens are similarly transferred to the spleen and bone marrow and elicit similar antivirus T cell priming is still unknown105. The trafficking properties of effector T cells generated in the spleen and the bone marrow, in particular their chemokine receptor repertoire, are, however, likely different from those generated in lung-draining LNs as the latter involve specific imprinting by lung DCs106.As is the case for innate leukocytes, the entry of virus-specific effector T cells via capillaries into the alveolar space is unlikely to involve the classical multistep adhesive cascades that are typically initiated by selectin-mediated capture and rolling on inflamed postcapillary venules (Fig. 2). Rather, effector T cells bind to ICAM1 and ICAM2, which are abundantly and constitutively expressed by all alveolar capillaries and prolong the time during which these T cells are retained inside the capillaries107. Without these LFA1-dependent interactions, effector T cells are predicted to respond less efficiently to chemotactic cues displayed across the capillary linings of individual inflamed alveoli107 (Table 2). On the other hand, effector T cell entry to the bronchial lamina propria during viral infections, including influenza virus infections, likely involves E-selectin, P-selectin and VCAM1, a key VLA4 ligand expressed by both resting and inflamed postcapillary vessels19,32 (Table 2; Fig. 2). Although CD4+ and CD8+ effector T cells express the VCAM1-binding integrin VLA4 (ref.108) as well as multiple glycoprotein ligands for these selectins, including the P-selectin and E-selectin ligand PSGL1 (ref.109), it is still unclear when and how these different selectins function in capturing circulating effector T cells in the postcapillary venules around influenza virus-infected or SARS-CoV-2-infected bronchial airways. It is likely, however, that these T cells must bind to one or several of the canonical chemokine receptors, including CCR2, CCR4, CXCR3 and CCR5, as well as leukotriene B4 receptor 1 (BLT1), to successfully cross these vessels and enter the infected lamina propria106,110,111 (Table 2; Fig. 2). Subgroups of individuals carrying the CCR5Δ32 loss-of-function mutation suffered from increased lethality during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, implicating this chemokine receptor in beneficial lymphocyte migration and function in this infection. Whether this polymorphism is also a risk factor for patients with COVID-19 remains an open question. However, it has been reported that CCR5 blocking can reduce viral loads in critically ill patients with COVID-19 (ref.112). Circulating memory CD8+ T cells may use CCR5 also for recruitment into airways during secondary viral infections113. After crossing the vascular endothelial layers of these blood vessels and their basement membrane, and navigating through the collagen-rich interstitium guided by chemokines that bind to CXCR3, CXCR6 and CCR5 (ref.21), effector T cells either cross the proximal epithelial layer to reach the airway lumen or become trapped inside or below this layer114. IL-15 produced by influenza virus-infected airways is also involved in effector T cell recruitment115. A recent genome-wide association study on patients with severe COVID-19 identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms in CXCR6 that are associated with reduced expression of the key chemokine receptor CXCR6 (ref.116). Although preliminary, this study points to a potential role of CXCR6 in efficient effector T cell recruitment and protective function in SARS-CoV-2-infected airways during primary infections.As acute viral lung infections are cleared, short-lived CD8+ effector T cells are replaced by CD127hi memory precursor T cells, which are capable of generating long-lived lung CD8+ resident memory T cells (TRM cells), primarily along the bronchial tree117. These cells are guided by the homeostatic bronchial epithelial cell-derived CXCR6 ligand CXCL16 (ref.114). Other long-lived memory cells can recirculate via lymphoid organs as central memory T cells or via other peripheral tissues as effector memory T cells. After influenza virus clearance, TRM cells enriched near the bronchial epithelia upregulate CD49a (also known as VLA1), an integrin that serves as a receptor for collagen IV, a key component of the epithelial basement membrane, and CD103, an integrin that binds to E-cadherin expressed by numerous airway epithelial cells. Moreover, these lymphocytes concomitantly downregulate LFA1 expression117. In addition, influenza virus-specific CD4+ effector T cells can differentiate into TRM cells that express elevated levels of LFA1 (ref.102), which may allow them to bind to nearby epithelial cells that constitutively express ICAM1, but it is still unclear whether these cells persist and have long-term protective properties. Notably, prior exposure to various influenza viruses has been shown to expand the pool of TRM cells to provide partial protection from heterosubtypic influenza virus strains103,117,118. Such tissue-resident SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive CD8+ and CD4+ memory T cells might also exist in individuals previously exposed to seasonally circulating coronavirus strains119,120. The protective potential of such cross-reactive CD8+ and CD4+ T cells in primary SARS-CoV-2 infections, is, however, still unclear.Leukocyte trafficking in lung repairLung recovery after viral infection has been studied in depth in mouse and ferret models of H1N1 influenza virus infection121. During infection, the collagenous assemblies in which both bronchioles and alveoli are embedded are extensively remodelled and take prolonged time to resume their original states122. The resolution of lung influenza virus infections is controlled by several key mechanisms and involves various resolving mediators, including lipoxins and protectins123. For instance, protectin D1 levels correlate inversely with influenza virus replication and immunopathology124. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ, a transcription factor expressed on numerous immune cells and platelets and activated by various endogenous ligands, is another key resolution factor, primarily owing to its ability to downregulate nuclear factor-κB-mediated transcription125. The binding of prostaglandins to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ attenuates monocyte and neutrophil trafficking, dampens the transcription of inflammatory mediators and increases survival126. Another factor in the resolution of lungs following influenza virus infection is the atypical receptor ACKR2, which scavenges multiple inflammatory CC chemokines127. Deficiency in ACKR2 results in pulmonary dysfunction owing to accelerated recruitment of pathogenic lymphocytes to influenza virus-infected lungs128.At later phases of influenza virus infections, subsets of CD8+ effector T cells become a major source of IL-10 near sites of epithelial infection, which dampens exaggerated innate and adaptive immune responses. These cells facilitate tissue repair along with macrophages, NK cells and ILCs, in particular ILC2 cells90. Soon after the initiation of resolution of inflammation, newly recruited Treg cells accumulate in various lung compartments, where they can attenuate inflammation via the production of transforming growth factor-β and IL-10 (ref.129). Treg cells recruited by blood vessels near terminal bronchioles also activate progenitor bronchioalveolar stem cells to differentiate into type 1 and type 2 pneumocytes130. Treg cells also attenuate fibrosis by inhibiting fibrocyte recruitment and proliferation, tightly regulated by the CXCR4–CXCL12 axis131. Treg cells express the growth factor amphiregulin, and Treg cell-specific amphiregulin deficiency impairs lung recovery in a murine model of influenza132. Amphiregulin is also produced by ILC2 cells, which are involved in recovery following influenza virus infection in mice90. As potent producers of IL-5, lung ILC2 cells may also regulate the infiltration of tissue-repairing eosinophil subsets at late stages of influenza virus infection90. Many other leukocyte subsets (NK cells, NKT cells, ILC3 cells, T helper 17 cells (TH17 cells), TH22 cells and γδ T cells) mitigate epithelial injury via IL-22 production133,134. Regulatory NKT cells also reduce the accumulation of inflammatory monocytes in influenza virus-infected lungs135. γδ T cells accumulate in the bronchoalveolar space only at late phases of influenza virus infection and are thought to contribute to lung recovery by multiple mechanisms in addition to IL-22 production136. The involvement of similar leukocyte subsets in lung repair processes during recovery from severe COVID-19 awaits confirmation by studies on patient samples and animal models. The trafficking signals that allow leukocytes involved in lung repair to migrate from the pulmonary circulation into different lung compartments also remain unknown.Vascular pathologies beyond the lungMost influenza viruses are restricted to the respiratory tract, owing to their requirement of a trypsin-like enzyme that is specifically expressed in the lung epithelium (Box 1). SARS-CoV-2 infectivity is considerably broader than that of influenza virus137 (Table 1). Arterial and venous endothelial cells express angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)138, the main entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and are therefore potential targets for infection. In addition, the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor neuropilin 1 is expressed in a variety of endothelial cells and neurons across tissues139. The exceptionally broad infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 allows the virus, once disseminated into non-respiratory blood vessels, to infect other organs, as has been observed in patients with severe COVID-19 (refs8,140). In these and other subsets of patients, SARS-CoV-2 might also invade peripheral nerve terminals and gain access to the central nervous system141.Another complication of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection is excessive coagulation and thromboinflammation8 (Fig. 3). This type of inflammation involves excessive thrombin production, the inhibition of fibrinolysis, activation of complement pathways, deposition of microthrombi and microvascular dysfunction138,142. In contrast to patients with fatal influenza virus infections, patients who die of SARS-CoV-2 infection often have widely disseminated blood clots143. Endothelial cells play essential roles in regulating vascular haemostasis, and resting endothelial cells prevent coagulation through the presentation of antithrombin III by heparin-like molecules, the synthesis of thrombomodulin and prostacyclin, and the maintenance of low levels of tissue factor144,145. The vascular pathology of COVID-19 might arise from direct ACE2 downregulation induced by viral entry into cells, resulting in a perturbed renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system146 and increased levels of the ACE2 substrate angiotensin II, a vasoconstrictor and profibrotic peptide8,147 (Fig. 3). The hypercoagulability seen in patients with severe COVID-19 appears to be worsened by platelet activation, which in turn contributes to additional neutrophil and monocyte recruitment and thromboinflammation65 (Fig. 3).It is likely that blood vessels in the lung are the first to be affected by this SARS-CoV-2-mediated pathology. Once viral particles spread beyond the pulmonary vascular barriers, an impairment of the antihaemostatic protective properties of pulmonary vessels may result in pulmonary embolism, leading to a possibly life-threatening underoxygenation of the blood142. Infection-mediated endothelial cell injury in patients with COVID-19 is characterized also by elevated levels of von Willebrand factor and P-selectin and the presence of activated neutrophils and macrophages in multiple vascular beds, including the kidneys, heart, small intestine and liver8. Endothelial damage might also account for the high rates of cardiovascular complications in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (ref.8). These processes likely enhance the local stimulation of endothelial cells and induce the de novo transcription of E-selectin, ICAM1, VCAM1 and inflammatory chemokines that promote neutrophil and monocyte recruitment (Table 2). These events may result in a vicious cycle of vessel damage, inflammation, additional leukocyte recruitment and enhanced thromboinflammation (Fig. 3). The systemic stimulation and damages to the respiratory and non-respiratory vascular systems can be further amplified by a cytokine storm originating in the lungs. Lung endothelial cells are orchestrators of cytokine amplification during influenza virus infections and likely contribute also to the cytokine storm reported in severe SARS-CoV-2 infections148. The risk factors for these SARS-CoV-2 infection complications are pre-existing conditions such as hypertension (high blood pressure), high cholesterol levels, diabetes, obesity and heart diseases, which are all morbidities associated with general endothelial cell dysfunction and a high susceptibility to additional damage140,149. The propensity of such patients to develop serious complications can be attributed to the chronic inflammatory status of their vessels as well as to abnormal accumulation of inflammatory myeloid leukocytes in these extrapulmonary vessels8. It is therefore anticipated that systemic vascular and coagulation therapy might both attenuate the pathological leukocyte recruitment to extrapulmonary vessels and curb the destructive functions of these leukocytes in these vessels2. The inhibition of specific leukocyte adhesion receptors and chemoattractant receptors, particularly on neutrophils and monocytes (Fig. 3), could therefore prove therapeutically beneficial to both respiratory and non-respiratory manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection.ConclusionThe COVID-19 outbreak represents the greatest worldwide infectious challenge in decades. Although featuring distinct mechanisms of infection and pathological outcomes, SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses likely share similar mechanisms of airway and lung inflammation and recovery5. When cellular stimulation, communication and effector functions are balanced, in both influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2 infections, viral clearance occurs with minimal damage to the infected airways and lungs. For SARS-CoV-2, a key outstanding question is when and how the lung and extrapulmonary blood vessels are targeted by SARS-CoV-2, and under what conditions the virus disseminates to other organs, either via the circulation or potentially via multiple neuronal routes141. In addition, the trafficking molecules used by leukocytes to interact with and emigrate from pulmonary blood vessels and to accumulate in extrapulmonary SARS-CoV-2-infected tissues, as well as the role of these leukocyte trafficking molecules in systemic vascular damage, deserve extensive research. Another open question is how the vascular complications of severe SARS-CoV-2 infections are affected by metabolic chronic inflammatory states and whether these states also affect infectivity. Obesity, for example, is a major co-morbidity factor in SARS-CoV-2 infection. This condition can affect numerous cell types in addition to vascular cells and can bias lung immunity to a type 17 response150. The involvement of a type 17 response in SARS-CoV-2-associated lung pathology remains an intriguing topic to investigate. Other pressing questions are the link between severe course of the disease and defective adaptive immunity (for example, in elderly patients151) or the significance of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive memory T cells119. Complementary immunological, single-cell transcriptomic and histological analyses of blood and tissue samples from patients with COVID-19 and post-mortem analyses should shed more light on these important issues152. New transgenic mouse strains that allow close mimicking of the course of human SARS-CoV-2 infection and pathology might also help to dissect the involvement of specific leukocyte trafficking molecules in severe SARS-CoV-2 infections. Several known and newly developed immunomodulatory drugs (for example, dexamethasone153, coagulation inhibitors, neutralizing antibodies and antiviral drugs) are currently being tested in numerous clinical trials in patients with COVID-19. However, to date, almost no drugs that specifically target the trafficking of pathological leukocytes or their adhesive interactions with inflamed blood vessels or platelet plaques have been tested for their ability to improve clinical outcomes in patients with severe COVID-19. We propose that inhibitors of such specific leukocyte trafficking molecules (Table 2), especially integrin-blocking monoclonal antibodies and small-molecule chemokine receptor blockers, which are extensively characterized in different inflammatory models154, could be tested for the improvement of current treatments.

The vaccine is already approved in the US under the tradename Flublok Quadrivalent (where it is also the only recombinant influenza vaccine). The first European launches could become available for the 2021-2022 influenza season in certain countries; with the main launch set for the 2022-2023 season.The flu vaccine's new recombinant technology is also being used in Sanofi’s lead COVID-19 vaccine candidate with GSK: which is expecting to launch a pivotal Phase 3 study before the year is out. This could be followed by a request for regulatory approval in the first half of 2021.Recombinant tech​Recombinant technology is a new way of producing influenza vaccines which ‘differs significantly’ to the egg-based and cell-based technologies currently used.These current technologies require the influenza virus to be replicated via the egg-based or cell-based methods: a process that leaves room for mutations to occur, meaning the virus produced for the vaccine may have disparities to the viruses circulating in the population and thus lower its efficacy.In contrast, recombinant technology - which only replicates the portion of the virus' genetic makeup necessary to prevent flu - does not rely on the influenza virus replicating itself. In an independent systematic review published in October 2020 for Supemtek, the European Center for Disease Prevention noted that “the recombinant haemagglutinin was found to provide a greater protective effect against overall influenza compared with no vaccination and with traditional influenza vaccination […] this effect may be attributable to either the restriction of mutations seen with egg-based vaccines or the higher dose of antigen seen in this type of influenza vaccine”.​Improved protection for older peopleSupemtek has been approved for use in adults aged 18 years and older in the EU: with Sanofi championing improved protection particularly in those aged 50 and over.A Phase 3 trial demonstrated that it improved protection against influenza compared to a standard-dose egg-based quadrivalent influenza vaccine, reducing the risk of influenza by an additional 30% in adults over 50 years old.“Supemtek is produced using recombinant technology, which allows ​an exact match to the key component of the influenza strains recommended by the World Health Organization, avoiding the risk of viral mutations,"​ states Sanofi. "Supemtek also contains three times more antigen than both egg-based and cell-based standard-dose vaccines.”​While the focus may be on COVID-19 vaccines this year, Sanofi notes that influenza-associated deaths range from 290,000 to 650,000 a year worldwide, with influenza cases increasing pressure on health systems through cases themselves and an increase in heart attack and stroke risks.“In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, preventing influenza remains a public health priority,” ​said Thomas Triomphe, Head of Sanofi Pasteur. “With Supemtek, we provide European health authorities with an additional innovative solution that has demonstrated increased ability to prevent influenza and its potentially severe complications, as well as the burden this causes on healthcare systems.”​Sanofi Pasteur, the vaccines global business unit of Sanofi, is upping delivery of flu vaccines by 20% this year: reaching a new high of 250 million doses.In the works: Sanofi/GSK COVID-19 vaccine candidateAn adjuvanted recombinant protein-based COVID-19 vaccineCurrently in a Phase 1/2 study in the US with 440 participants aged 18+First results from Phase 1/2 study expected in early December; with a Phase 3 trial set to start by the end of the yearRequest for regulatory approval could follow in the first half of 2021 Copyright - Unless otherwise stated all contents of this web site are © 2024 - William Reed Ltd - All Rights Reserved - Full details for the use of materials on this site can be found in the Terms & Conditions Related topics Bio developments COVID-19 Related news Show more Boosting supply: Sanofi to support BioNTech/Pfizer on COVID-19 vaccine production GSK sells vaccine laboratory activities to Nexelis Sanofi to acquire Kymab for up to $1.45bn Sanofi renews WHO partnership on Neglected Tropical Diseases Show more Follow us Facebook Twitter Linkedin Webinars On-demand webinars Manufacturing Friendly Aggregate Clearance in Downstream Processing of Bispecific and Traditional Antibodies Using a Novel POROS Mixed-Mode Chromatography Media Thermo Fisher Scientific - Biosciences Headlines Aditum Bio and Leads Biolabs join forces in new company to fight autoimmune diseases Sarepta discontinues development of Duchenne ASO treatment vesleteplirsen Synaffix and BigHat Biosciences collaborate to develop AI-designed ADC EMA accepts Alvotech and Advanz Pharma’s Marketing Authorization Application for biosimilar of J&J’s Simponi AbbVie acquires Aliada Therapeutics in $1.4 billion deal Abzena announces major expansion of its biologics manufacturing facility Aldevron’s Anu Codaty on passion, leadership, and innovation AstraZeneca’s rare disease therapy Fasenra receives EU approval Follow us Facebook Twitter Linkedin BioPharma-Reporter Advertise with us Why Register?

In this study, we analyzed molecular epidemiology and evolution of A(H1N1) pdm09, explored co-occurring mutations of HA and NA, and investigated effect of co-occurring mutations on patients’ clinical features.MethodsA(H1N1)pdm09 was confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. HA and NA genes were sequenced and phylogenetically analyzed. Clinical characteristics of the co-occurring mutations were analyzed statistically.ResultsBy analyzing the HA and NA gene sequences of 33 A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses during the 2015–2017 influenza season, we found that all the viruses shared high similarities to each other and the HA genes of these viruses exclusively belonged to subclade 6B.1A. Several unreported substitutions in HA and NA proteins were observed, furthermore, co-occurring mutations of HA-V169T, A278S, E508G, D518E and NA-V67I were detected in 30.3% (10/33) A(H1N1)pdm09 virus strains when comparing with vaccine strains A/California/07/2009 and A/Michigan/45/2015 (H1N1). Sore throat was significantly associated with co-occurring mutations in HA and NA of A(H1N1)pdm09 (χ2, P < 0.05).ConclusionsCo-occurring mutations in HA and NA were detected in A(H1N1)pdm09 isolated during 2015–2017 in Beijing. Symptomatically, sore throat was associated with co-occurring mutations in HA and NA of A(H1N1)pdm09. Therefore, studying the effect and mechanism of co-occurring mutations in HA and NA on patients’ clinical features is of note needed. BackgroundInfluenza is one of the most important respiratory infections of humans with significant morbidity and mortality each year worldwide. Of the four types of influenza virus, type A is the most virulent, and occasionally causes large-scale global pandemics [1]. Iuliano et al. estimated that 291,243–645,832 seasonal influenza-associated respiratory deaths occur annually worldwide [2, 3]. Under selective pressure from the host immune system, antigenic epitopes of influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) have continually evolved, termed antigenic drift, and influenza viruses evolve by genetic reassortments, leading in some occasions to life threatening pandemics [4]. The HA gene mutates the fastest of the eight genes in influenza A viruses, followed by the neuraminidase (NA) gene [5]. Evolutionary analysis of previous studies showed that influenza A(H1N1) pdm09 virus was derived from several viruses circulating in swine, and that the initial transmission to humans occurred several months before recognition of the outbreak [6]. Therefore, active epidemiological monitoring of influenza virus at molecular level is necessary [7], which is conducive to understand the evolution of influenza virus, in order to better select vaccine strains for effective prevention [8].New variants of HA and NA might contribute to the emergence of new clinical characteristics, for example, HA-D239E mutation was associated with mild infection, been less severe than HA-D239G and D239N [9], and NA-H275Y, NA-E119D conferred resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors [10, 11]. However, the interactions between virus evolution, epidemiology and human behavior were complicated [12]. HA and NA are the two major surface glycoproteins of influenza A viruses, both of which recognize the same molecule (sialic acid, SA) with conflicting activities [13]. In recent years, more attentions have been paid to study the effects between HA and NA [14, 15]. By recognizing and binding to SA, the HA allows virus attachment and entry into host cells, and the NA ensures the release of progeny virus [16]. A balance of competent HA and NA activities have been reported to be critical for efficient influenza virus replication and human-to-human transmission [17]. Since there are complementary and antagonistic effects between HA and NA, whether the co-occurring mutations (HA and NA mutated simultaneously) of A(H1N1)pdm09 have any impact on patients’ clinical characteristics is still unknown.Since 2009, we have monitored and made relevant statistics on the incidence of influenza viruses in Beijing. Studies on the evolution of surface antigen site mutations have performed using the viruses circulated in 2012–2014 [18,19,20]. In this study, we continued to investigate the molecular evolution and amino acid variation characteristics of HA and NA of A(H1N1) pdm09 during the 2015–2017 influenza seasons in Beijing, China. Meanwhile, we intended to explore co-occurring mutations of HA and NA in the new sites and analyzed effect of co-occurring mutations on patients’ clinical features.Materials and methodsPatients and sample collectionsThe study population included outpatients (≥ 16 years) who sought medical attention in the Department of Infectious Disease of Peking University People’s Hospital (PKUPH), a national influenza surveillance sentinel unit, at which at least 40,000 patients from all Beijing districts are seen annually. During the 2015–2017 influenza season (December to the following March), a total of 11,112 nasal swab specimens were obtained from influenza-like illness patients. The samples were screened for influenza A and B viruses by using colloidal gold method. The influenza A positive samples were immediately placed in virus transport media tubes and were stored at − 80 °C within 24 h.RNA extraction and influenza A subtypingWe extracted RNA from samples using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Cat. No.52904, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and performed the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with a commercial kit (Cat. No. 18080051, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), following the manufacturer’s instructions. The complementary DNAs (cDNAs) generated from the reverse transcription were stored at − 20 °C until use.Subtypes H1 and H3 were identified by specific primers for influenza A positive samples. H1- and H3-specific primers were listed as follows: H1 forward primer (5′-ATGAAGGCAATACTAGTAG-3′ and 5′-GATTGCAATACAACTTGTC-3′), reverse primer (5′-GATCGGATGTATATTCTGAAATGG-3′ and 5′-AATACATATTCTACACTGTAGAGACCCA-3′); H3 forward primer (5′-AAAGCAGGGGATAATTCTA-3′ and 5′-GGTTACTTCAAAATAC-3′), reverse primer (5′-ATTGCTGCTTGAGTGCTT-3′ and 5′-AGTAGAAACAAGGGTGTTTT-3′); N1 forward primer (5′-AGCAAAAGCAGGAG-3′ and 5′-GACAGGCCTCATACAAGATCTTC-3′), reverse primer (5′-GTGATAATTAGGGGCATTC-3′ and 5′-AATTACTTGTCAATGG-3′); N2 forward primer (5′-AGCAAAAGCAGGAGT-3′ and 5′-GAACTTGTRCAGTRGTAATG -3′), reverse primer (5′-CGACATGCTGAGCACTYCCTGAC-3′ and 5′-AGTAGAAACAAGGAG-3′).Gene sequencingSamples tested positive for seasonal H1 subtypes were then randomly selected for analysis. For sequencing the HA and NA genes, high-fidelity thermostable DNA polymerase (Cat. No.11304011, Invitrogen) was used with primers of pdmHA-F (5′-TGTAAAACGACGGCCAGTATGAAGGCAATACTAGTAG-3′) and pdmHA-R (5′-CAGGAAACAGCTATGACCAATACATATTCTACACTGTAGAGACCCA-3′) for HA genes or pdmNA-F (5′-TGTAAAACGACGGCCAGTAGCAAAAGCAGGAG-3′) and pdmNA-R (5′-CAGGAAACAGCTATGACCAATTACTTGTCAATGG-3′) for NA genes. Products were sequenced using the Sanger method. The PCR amplification system included the cDNA template (4 μl), Autoclaved, distilled water (12.1 μl), 10X High Fidelity PCR Buffer (2 μl), 50 mM MgSO4 (0.6 μl), 10 mM dNTP Mix (0.4 μl), 10 µM forward primer (0.4 μl), 10 µM reverse primer (0.4 μl), and Platinum® Taq DNA Polymerase High Fidelity (0.1 μl of 5 U/µL). The PCR conditions for HA genes of influenza A were: 94 °C for 3 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 0.5 min, 55 °C for 0.5 min and 72 °C for 1.5 min, with extension at 72 °C for 7 min. The PCR conditions for NA genes of influenza A were: 94 °C for 3 min, followed by 40 cycles of 94 °C for 0.5 min, 52 °C for 0.5 min and 72 °C for 70 s, with extension at 72 °C for 7 min. PCR products were analyzed by the method of electrophoresis.Phylogenetic analysis of HA and NA genesNucleotide sequences of H1 or N1 influenza viruses which were relative to our studied human A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza strains were obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database. All HA and NA gene sequences were aligned using ClustalW 1.83. Phylogenetic analysis of HA and NA gene sequences was performed using MEGA software version 7.0. Sequences of H1 and N1 genes in our study have been deposited into NCBI with the accession number MN636362-636389, MN636393-636406, and MN636408-636423.Statistical analysisStatistical analysis was performed using SPSS statistical software version 22.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Continuous variables were expressed as means ± SD or median (interquartile range) and discrete variables as counts (percentage). Two-group comparisons of normally distributed data were performed with the independent samples t-test. Frequency comparisons were made with the χ2 test. P values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.ResultsEpidemics characteristics of influenza virusThe Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) organized the Influenza Laboratory Surveillance Network for nationwide monitoring on patients with influenza-like illness in China. In order to elucidate the epidemiology of influenza virus in northern China during April 2015 to May 2017, we summarized the weekly data during the influenza epidemic. As shown in Fig. 1, influenza B viruses co-circulating with A(H1N1)09pdm and H3N2 viruses in 2015–2016 flu season in northern China. The prevalence of influenza B viruses has been maintained at a high-level during February and March in 2016. In contrast, Influenza A viruses were predominant during the 2016–2017 flu season. H3N2 epidemic started earlier and peaked at the beginning of 2017, then A(H1N1)pdm09 gradually increased, and peaked in the middle of March (Fig. 1).Fig. 1Distribution of influenza viruses in northern China. The data were from weekly data of Influenza Laboratory Surveillance Network during April 2015 to May 2017. Red is A(H1N1)pdm09, green is influenza H3N2, and blue is influenza BFull size imageInfluenza A subtypingDuring the 2015–2017 influenza season, 126 nasal swab samples tested positive for influenza A virus using colloidal gold method were collected from the Department of Infectious Disease of PKUPH. A(H1N1)pdm09 were detected in 42 samples and the remaining 84 samples were H3N2 positive. As shown in Fig. 2, the prevalence situation of influenza A viruses in Beijing in this study was similar to those in Northern China. H3N2 viruses were co-circulating with A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses in 2015–2016. However, the H3N2 viruses were predominant during the 2015–2017 flu season (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Monthly distribution of 126 nasal swab samples tested positive for influenza A virusFull size imageHomology analysis of Hemagglutinin (HA) and Neuraminidase (NA) genesThe HA and NA genes of the 33 A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were fully sequenced and phylogenetically characterized. As shown in Additional file 1–4: Table 1–4, HA genes of the viruses shared 96.9–100% nucleotide similarity and 97.9–100% amino acid identity to each other. NA genes of the viruses shared 97.3–100% nucleotide similarity and 96.3–100% amino acid identity to each other. In addition, A(H1N1)pdm09 isolates in this study shared 96.9–98.5% nucleotide similarity and 96.3–97.8% amino acid identity of their HA and NA genes to A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) vaccine strain, respectively. Moreover, A(H1N1)pdm09 isolates shared 97.5–100.0% nucleotide similarity and 97.8–100% amino acid identity of their HA and NA genes to A/Michigan/45/2015 (H1N1) vaccine strain, respectively. These results suggest that these viruses contained similar gene constellation and possessed high gene identity to the vaccine strain A/Michigan/45/2015 (H1N1).Phylogenetic analysis of HA and NA genes of A(H1N1)pdm09 virusesTo determine the evolutionary relationship of 33 A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses detected during 2015–2017, HA and NA gene sequences were compared with other A(H1N1)pdm09 sequences on NCBI. Phylogenetic analyses of the HA genes showed although the tested A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses clustered into two subclades, they fell together with the vaccine strain A/Michigan/45/2015 (H1N1), and belonged to subclade 6B.1 (Fig. 3). Like HA genes, the NA genes showed the same evolutionary pattern. These results suggest that these viruses shared common evolutionary lineages to the vaccine strain A/Michigan/45/2015 (H1N1).Fig. 3Phylogenetic tree based on HA and NA nucleotide sequences of A(H1N1)pdm09 from 2009 to 2017. Phylogenetic analysis of HA and NA gene sequences was performed with the Tamura 3-parameter model which was the best fit for our data using MEGA software version 7.0, with gamma-distributed rates. The reliability of the maximum-likelihood tree was run by bootstrap analysis with 1000 replications. ▲ Represents the vaccine strainFull size imageSubstitution analysis of HA and NA genesCompared with the vaccine strains of A/California/07/2009 and A/Michigan/45/2015 (H1N1), 33 strains of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in this study exhibited several unreported substitutions, as shown in Table 1. HA of all strains had S220T, K180Q, S202T mutations and NA V264I mutation. The oseltamivir resistance substitution of NA-H275Y has not been observed in these strains.Table 1 Unreported substitutions of 33 strains of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in this studyFull size tableCo-occurring mutation analysis in both HA and NA proteinsBased on above substitution analysis of HA and NA genes, co-occurring mutations of HA-V169T, A278S, E508G, D518E and NA-V67I were detected in 30.3% (10/33) A(H1N1)pdm09 virus strains when comparing with vaccine strains A/California/07/2009 and A/Michigan/45/2015 (H1N1). To investigate the associations with clinical characteristics and the co-occurring mutations in HA and NA, we collected medical data from these ten patients in which the above co-occurring mutations were detected, including demographic characteristics, symptoms, laboratory test results, and whether complicated by pneumonia (Table 2). Another ten patients with no co-occurring mutations detected were selected randomly as controls. By comparing these two groups, we found that sore throat was more common in co-occurring mutations [100.0% (10/10) vs. 50.0% (5/10), P < 0.05]. No statistically significant difference was detected for other clinical characteristics. This result indicated that sore throat was associated with co-occurring mutations in HA and NA of A(H1N1)pdm09.Table 2 Demographic and clinical characteristics of patients in different groupsFull size tableDiscussionSince its emergence in 2009, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 strain has been one of the seasonal influenza strains and circulated seasonally in humans. Genetic evolution of seasonal influenza viruses is gradual. The close monitoring on the viruses are of note for the vaccine strain recommendations. Since 2009, persistent monitoring of the influenza viruses has been conducted in PKUPH in Beijing, China. We have previously studied the evolution of surface antigen site mutations using the viruses circulated in 2012–2014 [19, 20]. During the 2015–2017 influenza season, influenza A viruses have impacted greatly on the public health (Fig. 1). In order to continuously exploring molecular epidemiological evolution, we analyzed the evolutionary and molecular characteristics of the 33 strain A(H1N1)pdm09 virus strains during the 2015–2017. In consistent with the previous study [5], the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses circulated in 2015–2017 in Beijing, China, were belonged to subclade 6B.1A (Fig. 3). The two genetic subclades may be caused by several amino acid substitutions.Comparing to the HA protein of A/California/07/2009 vaccine strain, A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses circulated in Beijing during 2012–2014 contained several substitutions in the key epitope (Sa, Sb, Ca and Cb) [19, 20], including H155Q in Ca epitopes, L178I/ K180Q in Sa epitope, and S202T in Sb epitope and so on. In this study, all A(H1N1)pdm09 detected during 2015–2017 had S220T, K180Q, S202T mutations, and no H155Q/R, L178I, G187E mutations was detected. The newly discovered S86T was near Cb epitope. The V169T/S181T was near Sa epitope, and G254 was near Ca epitope. They may affect the antigenic properties of the viruses. Substitutions which affect the viral receptor binding profiles have not been detected. It indicated that the evolutions of A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were gradually in progress. The emergence of unreported mutations, especially those with potential to affect the viral antigen should be of note monitored.Correspondingly, substitutions in NA antigen epitope have been reported to occur in the A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses during 2012–2014, including NA- K84N, P93S, V106I L139V, I163T, V264I, E287K and S340F. while in this study, NA-V264I mutation occurred in all the A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses detected during 2015–2017. No mutations of NA-K84N, V106I, L139V, I163T, E287K, or S340F has been detected. Moreover, seven locus mutations were newly found, including A86T (1strain), F115L (4 strains), N449T (4 strains), S450V (4 strains), D451T (4 strains), T452L (4 strains), V453W (4 strains).Comparing with substitutions in the A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses in 2012–2014, several substitutions have not be detected in 2015–2017. It suggested that these variation sites may only be transient variation. On contrast, the increased prevalence of HA-K180Q and NA-V264I mutations from 2012–2014 to 2015–2017 in all strains suggested that several mutations may gradually become dominant over time under the pressure of human immune selection [21, 22].Many events such as recombination and infection of new hosts can disrupt the balance between HA and NA, but mutations in the HA and NA genes can make up for this imbalance [23,24,25]. Co-occurring mutations, including HA-V169T, A278S, E508G, D518E and NA-V67I were found in the new sites compared with vaccine strains A/California/07/2009 and A/Michigan/45/2015 (H1N1). Symptomatically, sore throat was associated with co-occurring mutations in HA and NA of A(H1N1)pdm09.While our study highlighted the importance of investigating the effect and mechanism of co-occurring mutation of HA and NA; however, this study had several limitations. First, the study population were all from outpatients who were not severely ill, and the findings may not be generalized to hospitalized or severely ill individuals. Second, the medical data collection was limited, and many important clinical data such as further examination, period of treatment, and prognosis were not available. Third, the number of study patients may not be sufficient to draw the firm conclusions. Fourth, co-occurring mutations we observed had possibility of gradual accumulation of mutations, and we analyzed the co-occurring mutation of HA and NA through the clinical manifestations without mechanism. Therefore, further studies with a larger sample size and more clinical data will be needed to confirm and extend our findings. Evidences of increased fitness or epistasis between the HA and NA segments will also be needed in order to exclude gradual accumulation of mutations.ConclusionsIn this study, we analyzed molecular evolution and amino acid variation characteristics of HA and NA of A(H1N1) pdm09 during the 2015–2017 influenza seasons in Beijing, founding these viruses shared common evolutionary lineages to the vaccine strain A/Michigan/45/2015 (H1N1). However, through our team’s monitoring on molecular evolution and amino acid variation of A(H1N1)pdm09 these years, some variation sites were only transient variation, while some from one to all strains, suggesting that persistent monitoring was needed. Co-occurring mutations of HA-V169T, A278S, E508G, D518E and NA-V67I were detected in 30.3% (10/33) A(H1N1)pdm09 virus strains when comparing with the two vaccine strains A/California/07/2009 and A/Michigan/45/2015 (H1N1). We also made progress on exploring the clinical characteristics of co-occurring mutations in HA and NA proteins of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. Above results highlight the fact that it is necessary to study the effect and mechanism of co-occurring mutations in the surface antigens HA and NA on patients’ clinical features, and one day those co-occurring mutations maybe used as biomarkers of clinical features to assist the clinical work.

Here we present a total of 16,091 samples that were collected from May 2016 to February 2019 in 23 provinces and municipalities in China. We identify 2048 AIV-positive samples and perform next generation sequencing. AIV-positive rates (12.73%) from samples had decreased substantially since 2016, compared to that during 2014–2016 (26.90%). Additionally, H9N2 has replaced H5N6 and H7N9 as the dominant AIV subtype in both chickens and ducks. Notably, novel reassortants and variants continually emerged and disseminated in avian populations, including H7N3, H9N9, H9N6 and H5N6 variants. Importantly, almost all of the H9 AIVs and many H7N9 and H6N2 strains prefer human-type receptors, posing an increased risk for human infections. In summary, our nation-wide surveillance highlights substantial changes in the circulation of AIVs since 2016, which greatly impacts the prevention and control of AIVs in China and worldwide.

In particular, these AIVs were shown to be able to infect humans3,4,5. As of 24 June 2019, at least 861 human cases with H5N1 infections have been reported globally6. Although there were only 50 reported human cases since the first human infection with H9N2 AIVs in 19984,5, a seroprevalence rate of 11.20% against H9N2 AIVs among healthy occupational workers was observed in several provinces of China during 2014–16, which is substantially higher than those against H7N9, H5N1, H5N6, H6N1, and H6N6 AIVs7, implying that H9 AIV has a higher infectivity to humans than other AIVs and can cause transient human infections.Worryingly, a number of novel reassortant subtypes including H7N9, H6N1, H10N8, H5N6, and H7N4 were reported to infect humans5,8,9,10,11,12. In particular, evidence has shown that H9N2 contributed to the emergence and evolution of these novel human-infecting AIVs (e.g. H7N9, H10N8, and H5N6) and that poultry carrying H9N2 in live poultry markets (LPMs) may act as the genetic incubator for creating novel reassortant AIVs13,14,15,16. This highlights the importance of continuous surveillance of AIVs in LPMs.In our previous report, we have established the Center for Influenza Research and Early-warning, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASCIRE) surveillance network and performed monitoring studies for AIVs during 2014–16 in LPMs in China13,17. We found that while H9N2 was the dominant subtype in northern China, H5N6 has replaced H5N1 as a dominant AIV subtype in southern China. Importantly, H5N6 seems to be more virulent than H5N1 in humans based on the clinical data and case fatality rates (CFRs) (H5N6: ~69.60% and H5N1: ~52.50%)18, even though only 23 human H5N6 cases have been reported thus far5. In addition, H9N2 was primarily isolated from chickens, while H5N6 was mainly isolated from ducks13. Almost simultaneously, H5N8 HPAIV spread globally and caused outbreaks in migratory birds in Asia, Europe, and North America1,5,19. Furthermore, H7N9 HPAIV emerged in 201620,21 with a higher CFR compared to H7N9 LPAIV in humans22. Remarkably, the number of human H7N9 cases reported in the 2016–17 influenza season alone approximately equalled all of the previously recorded cases during 2013–165,23.In the present study, we continued our previous work from 2014–16 and report the results of nation-wide AIV surveillance in China during 2016–19. Our results show that the AIV positive rate at LPMs substantially decreased compared with that during 2014–16. H9N2 has become the dominant subtype both in chickens and ducks across China. In contrast, H7N9 has almost disappeared in 2018. Furthermore, H7N3 reassortants, H5N6 HPAIV variants, as well as H9N9 and H9N6 LPAIV reassortants have emerged, warranting constant monitoring.ResultsAIV positive rates significantly decreased during 2016–19A total of 16,091 samples were collected from May 2016 to February 2019 from 37 cities in 23 provinces, municipalities and minority autonomous regions in China (Fig. 1a), in which 2048 samples were identified to be AIV positive by next generation sequencing (NGS), with a positive rate of 12.73% (Supplementary Data 1–5).Fig. 1: The distribution of sampling sites and avian influenza viruses (AIVs) in LPMs across China.a Map of the AIV sampling sites and isolation rates in LPMs. AIV surveillance sites in 37 cities (indicated by black dots) of 23 provinces or municipalities or minority autonomous regions in China are divided into seven different regions: North (Inner Mongolia, NM and Jilin, JL; orange), East-Central (Shanxi, SX; Ningxia, NX; Shandong, SD; Shaanxi, SaX and Henan, HeN; light green), South-Central (Anhui, AH; Hunan, HuN; Jiangxi, JX and Fujian, FJ; yellow), Yangtze River Delta (Jiangsu, JS and Zhejiang, ZJ; pink), South-West (Sichuan, SC; Chongqing, CQ; Yunnan, YN; and Guizhou, GZ; orange red), South (Guangxi, GX; Guangdong, GD and Hainan, HaN; dark green), and West (Xinjiang, XJ; Qinghai, QH; and Xizang, XZ; light purple). The red portion in each pie chart indicates the isolation rate of AIV in this region. The standard map was downloaded from Ministry of Natural Resources of the People’s Republic of China (http://bzdt.ch.mnr.gov.cn/), and the collection sites of LPMs in our study were marked on the map using ArcGIS. b AIV positive rates of the present study (2016–19) and the previous study in 2014–1613. The regions included North, East-Central, South-Central, Yangtze River Delta, South-West, and South. The numbers on the column represent the AIV isolation rate. c Subtype proportions of AIVs in the pure isolates with a single HxNy subtype. d The proportion of HA and NA from the impure isolates containing over two HA or NA subtypes. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageTo better analyze the geographical distribution of AIVs in LPMs in China, 23 provinces were divided into seven different regions on the basis of geographic proximity: North (Inner Mongolia, NM; Jilin, JL), East-Central (Shanxi, SX; Ningxia, NX; Shandong, SD; Shaanxi, SaX; Henan, HeN), South-Central (Anhui, AH; Hunan, HuN; Jiangxi, JX; Fujian, FJ), Yangtze River Delta (Jiangsu, JS; Zhejiang, ZJ), South-West (Sichuan, SC; Chongqing, CQ; Yunnan, YN; Guizhou, GZ), South (Guangxi, GX; Guangdong, GD; Hainan, HaN), and West (Xinjiang, XJ; Qinghai, QH; Xizang, XZ). The AIV positive rates in the seven regions were 5.01%, 9.50%, 20.48%, 20.83%, 8.11%, 8.80%, and 4.84%, respectively (Fig. 1a, b). Remarkably, aside from the East-Central region, the AIV positive rates in the other five regions (the North, South-Central, Yangtze River Delta, South-West, and South) substantially decreased during 2016–19 compared to those during 2014–16, especially in the South (from 32.40% to 8.80%) and South-West (from 31.78% to 8.11%) regions (Fig. 1b).Further analysis revealed that the AIV isolation rate in ducks was the highest (17.88% [525 positive/2,936 samples]), followed by geese (14.52% [63/434]), chickens (12.47% [1,290/10,344]), environmental samples (9.29% [144/1,550]), and then pigeons (3.14% [26/827]) (Supplementary Data 1–5). The results demonstrated that the AIV isolation rates were higher in waterfowl (ducks and geese) than those of land poultry (chickens and pigeons).H9N2 AIV is dominant in LPMs in ChinaThe 2048 AIV-positive isolates were then sequenced using NGS. The isolates with single HxNy subtype (pure isolates) were found in 70.41% (1442/2048) of the 2048 samples, and the isolates with over two HA or NA subtypes (impure isolates) were found in the remaining 29.59% (606/2,048) of the samples (Supplementary Data 1–5). Among the 1442 pure viruses with the AIV subtype clearly determined, H9N2 was the dominant subtype (n = 1049, 72.75%), with the proportions ranging from 57.69% (West) to 95.95% (East-Central) in the seven defined regions (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Data 1–5). However, the proportion of subtype composition and the prevalent subtype in the seven regions were slightly different. The isolation rates of H5 subtypes were higher in the North (33.33%) and in the West regions (42.31%: 30.77% for H5N8 and 11.54% for H5N6) compared to those in other regions (Fig. 1c). However, only 6 and 26 pure isolates were identified in the North and West regions, respectively (Supplementary Data 1–5).H7N9 AIVs mainly circulated in the Yangtze River Delta with an isolation rate of 14.29% and in the South-Central region with 9.54%. H6N6 was prevalent primarily in three adjacent regions (South-Central, South, and South-West), with isolation rates between 6.20% and 9.32%. Overall, the top four subtypes circulating in LPMs in China included H9N2 (72.75%), H5N6 (7.84%), H7N9 (5.89%), and H6N6 (5.20%), respectively (Fig. 1c), and H9N2 has become dominant in LPMs in both Northern and Southern China.The proportion of each specific HA and NA gene in the impure AIV isolates based on the NGS results were also analyzed. The top five HA and four NA subtypes for the impure isolates were H9 (41.15%), H5 (25.10%), H6 (14.49%), H3 (8.66%), H7 (7.39%), and N2 (45.14%), N6 (39.35%), N8 (6.31%), and N9 (4.91%), respectively (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 1a, b). The H9 and N2 were the dominant HA and NA subtypes, respectively. Meanwhile, the proportions of H9 and H5 subtypes in the 71 impure isolates were 42.25% and 7.04% in the North region, respectively, and 43.48% and 41.30% in the 92 impure samples in the West region (Supplementary Data 1–5). It should be noted that a few rare HA and NA subtypes such as H1, H3, H4, H10, H11, N1, N3, and N4 were observed in the impure samples, and a number of rare subtypes, such as H7N2/N3/N6/N7, H6N2/N8, and H9N6/N9, were also identified from the pure isolates (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 1c).Therefore, there was a similar trend in the proportion of each HA and NA subtype between the pure and impure isolates, and the dominant HA and NA subtypes were the same in both groups. The top five HA subtypes in the pure isolates were H9 (74.41%), H5 (8.67%), H7 (8.25%), H6 (5.76%), and other (2.91%), whereas those in the impure isolates included H9 (41.15%), H5 (25.10%), H6 (14.49%), H7 (7.39%), and other (11.87%). The top five NA subtypes in the pure isolates were N2 (73.86%), N6 (13.73%), N9 (7.28%), N8 (1.87%), and other (3.26%), while those in the impure isolates were N2 (45.14%), N6 (39.35%), N8 (6.31%), N9 (4.91%), and other (4.29%) (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Data 1–5).To explore the distribution of virus subtypes in LPMs over the last few years, the subtype composition based on the NGS results between 2016 and 2019 was analyzed (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 1a–c). From 2016 to 2018, the proportion of H9N2 AIVs in the pure isolates steadily increased (54.05% in 2016, 65.63% in 2017, and 84.88% in 2018; Supplementary Fig. 1c). All 35 pure isolates from four provinces (Anhui, Henan, Shandong, and Shanxi) belonged to H9N2 during January and February of 2019 (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Data 1–5), and the H9 subtype was also found in 51.11% of the impure isolates. However, the proportion of pure H5Ny, H6Ny, and H7Ny AIVs decreased from 2016 to 2018 (Fig. 2a). Notably, the proportion of H7N9 isolates reached the peak in 2017 (11.72%), but almost disappeared in 2018 (Supplementary Fig. 1c), with just one H7N9 impure isolate identified containing H7 (151,233 reads), N9 (62,015 reads), and H9 (485 reads) gene sequences. Alternatively, H7N3 AIVs were identified in 2018 with a proportion of 5.33% (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 1c).Fig. 2: Virus subtype proportions and host species distributions of the pure isolates with a single HxNy subtype.a The proportion of various HA subtypes of pure isolates with a single HxNy subtype isolated between 2016 and 2019. The major prevalent subtypes include H5, H6, H7, and H9. H5 viruses include H5N6 and H5N8; H6 viruses include H6N2, H6N6, and H6N8; H7 viruses include H7N2, H7N3, H7N6, H7N7, and H7N9; H9 viruses include H9N2, H9N6, and H9N9. b Host species distributions of H5N6, H6N6, H7N3, H7N9, H9N2, and other subtypes. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageOur previous study has shown that different host species carried distinct major AIV subtypes13. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 2a, both H9N2 and H7N9 AIVs were mainly isolated from chickens (83.61% vs. 72.95%), and both H6N6 and H5N6 AIVs were mostly isolated from ducks (83.99% vs. 57.51%). Additionally, most of the rare subtypes were primarily isolated from ducks (65.84%). In contrast to our previous report that H9N2 and H5N6 were dominant in chickens and ducks, respectively, H9N2 was the prevalent subtype in both chickens (89.95%) and ducks (35.71%; Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 2b). It should also be noted that for the three subtypes (H9N2, H7N9, and H5N6), more strains were isolated from the oropharyngeal swabs of chickens or ducks (50.05%, 17.65%, and 23.89%) than those from cloacal samples (16.97%, 4.71%, and 15.04%). Regarding the H6N6 subtype, strains isolated from cloacal samples (41.33%) were more than those from oropharyngeal swabs of ducks (25.33%; Supplementary Fig. 2a).Genetic evolution of H9N2 AIVsSince H9N2 AIVs have now become dominant in China, we performed a phylogenetic analysis of 7521 HA genes of H9N2 AIVs from China, including 1477 sequences described in the present study (Fig. 3a). The HA phylogenetic tree revealed that Chinese H9N2 AIVs diverged approximately during 2012–13, resulting in three Clades (C1–C3) with between-group distance of ≥1% (Supplementary Data 6). C1 continued to diverge into several highly similar small sub-clades C1.1–C1.5 (with between-group distance of ≥0.3%, Supplementary Data 6), and most have been co-circulating during our surveillance period. In contrast, C2 and C3 viruses circulated at very low levels, with few viruses isolated from 2012 to 2016. However, the prevalence of C2 and C3 remarkably increased during 2017 and 2018. In detail, 2498 H9 strains isolated since 2017 belonged to C1, 783 viruses belonged to C2, and 211 belonged to C3. Regarding our H9 isolates since 2017 (n = 1350), 937 strains fell within C1, 393 in C2, and 20 in C3.Fig. 3: Phylogenetic analysis of the HA gene of H9Ny AIVs and the NA gene of H9N2 AIVs.a Phylogenetic tree of the HA gene of H9Ny AIVs. b Phylogenetic tree of the NA gene of H9N2 viruses. Viruses are marked with different colors according to the collection dates (before 2017: blue violet, in 2017: orange, in 2018: light green, and in 2019: light blue). Both trees are rooted using CK/BJ/1/1994(H9N2). The light blue and red triangles represent H9N6 and H9N9 viruses, respectively. All blue dots in the phylogenetic trees (a) represent H9N2 and H9N9 strains used for the receptor-binding test in this study. The labels with gray lines indicate all of the H9 isolates sequenced in this study.Full size imageAlthough the majority of the H9 isolates belonged to the H9N2 subtype, several H9N9 and H9N6 viruses were also found to be co-circulating, scattering amongst the tree with H9N2 AIVs, without forming separate clusters (Fig. 3a). Similarly, in the NA phylogenetic tree of the H9N2 AIVs, there were two major Clades (C1 and C2, with between-group distance of ≥1.5%, Supplementary Data 6), and they also diverged during 2012–13 (Fig. 3b). The majority of our isolates since 2017 (n = 1151) belonged to C1 and 161 isolates belonged to C2. Therefore, multiple clusters of H9N2 AIVs have been co-circulating in China after 2012–13.Several amino acids (Q226L, I155T, and H183N) affecting the receptor-binding preference of H9Ny AIVs were analyzed. The majority of the H9 strains possessed 226L (99.93% [1,438/1,439]), 155T (99.58% [1,433/1,439]), and 183N (99.93%, [1,438/1,439]; Supplementary Data 7 and 8), suggesting that they may have acquired human receptor (α2-6-SA) binding capacity. In total, 99.43% (1395/1403) of the sequenced H9N2 strains had NA stalk deletions (positions 62–64), and no NA inhibitor (NAI)-resistant mutations were found in the NA proteins of H9Ny (Supplementary Data 7).Continued evolution and emergence of H5, H7, and H6 variantsThe H5 subtype was detected in 384 of the isolates sequenced from 2016 to 2019. H5N6 subtype AIVs (n = 344) accounted for the majority (89.58%), followed by H5N8 (n = 18, 4.69%) and H5N2 (n = 16, 4.17%). All of the H5N6, H5N8, and H5N2 AIVs fell within Clade 2.3.4.4 (Fig. 4a), which could be classified into four sub-clades, with between-group distance of ≥3% (Supplementary Data 6). Clades 2.3.4.4a and 2.3.4.4d corresponded to the minor and major lineages designated in our previous report13. Clades 2.3.4.4b and 2.3.4.4c were already found to exist in our previous research, but were not designated then. In total, 344 strains, including 332 H5N6 and 12 H5N2 AIVs, fell within Clade 2.3.4.4d (the previously designated major lineage), whereas 28 strains (H5N2, n = 4; H5N6, n = 10; H5N8, n = 14) clustered in 2.3.4.4b and 6 strains (H5N6, n = 2; H5N8, n = 4) clustered in 2.3.4.4c. Notably, none of our strains belonged to Clade 2.3.4.4a (the previously designated minor lineage). Although 344 strains were classified into 2.3.4.4d, most (n = 324) formed a separate sub-clade within 2.3.4.4d with a distance of 1.2%. In addition, >80% strains in this unique sub-clade possessed distinct amino acid substitutions in the HA antigenic regions according to the H3 structure24,25,26. It should be noted that only six strains from 2018 belonged to the H5N1 subtype, and all of them fell within Clade 2.3.2.1c (Fig. 4a).Fig. 4: Phylogenetic analysis of the HA gene sequences of H5 and H7 AIVs.a Phylogenetic tree of the HA gene of H5 AIVs. The orange, light blue, red, and light green lines in the tree represent viruses described in this study isolated from 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively. The dark blue lines represent the reference strains previously reported by Bi et al.13. The subtrees marked with a pink and light blue background represent the major lineage (Clade 2.3.4.4d) and the minor lineage (Clade 2.3.4.4a), respectively. The purple lines represent other reference strains from the Influenza Virus Resource at NCBI and the GISAID databases. b Phylogenetic tree of the HA gene of H7 AIVs. The subtrees marked with a pink and light blue background represent H7 strains belonging to the Yangtze River Delta lineage and Pearl River Delta lineage, respectively. The subtree of the H7N9 HPAIVs previously analyzed by Quan et al.23 is marked with the blue background on the upper right. The orange, light blue, and red lines of the tree represent strains isolated from 2016, 2017, and 2018, respectively. The subtree displayed in the dashed frame on the upper right included the HA genes of 33 H7N3 isolates in this study. The dotted lines represent H7N2 (n = 3), H7N6 (n = 3), and H7N8 (n = 1) viruses identified in this study. c The topology of the HA tree of H7 AIVs was shown at the bottom-right, with dots represent 160 H7 AIV strains identified in our surveillance during 2016–19. All blue dots in the phylogenetic trees (a, b) represent the H5 and H7 strains used for receptor-binding test in this study. In addition, the red pentagrams represent the H5/H7 bivalent vaccine strains, A/chicken/Guizhou/4/2013(H5N1) and A/pigeon/Shanghai/S1069/2013(H7N9), respectively.Full size imageOur surveillance identified a total of 160 H7 AIV strains during 2016–19. To our surprise, they belonged to at least six different subtypes: H7N9 (n = 119), H7N3 (n = 33), H7N2 (n = 3), H7N6 (n = 3), H7N8 (n = 1), and H7N7 (n = 1; Fig. 4b, c). Phylogenetic analysis of the HA gene showed that apart from one H7N7 strain Dk/JX/1-07 NCDZT35N-C/2016, all of the remaining H7 strains (n = 159) clustered together with the human-infecting H7N9 AIVs (Fig. 4c) within the Yangtze River Delta lineage. Apart from H7N3, other H7 subtypes, e.g. H7N2, H7N6, and H7N8 AIVs scattered in the Yangtze River Delta lineage with LPAIV H7N9 contemporarily circulating in LPMs in different regions of China (Fig. 4b).Of note, 31 of 33 H7N3 strains isolated from ducks and two strains from chickens from Fujian in 2018 formed an independent cluster within the H7N9 HPAIV lineage (Fig. 4b). The NA gene sequences of the H7N3 AIVs showed that they were closely related to AIVs of the N3 subtype circulating in ducks in southern China during 2017–18 (Supplementary Data 9). We have performed a complete phylogenetic analysis of the eight gene segments of 615 H7N3 AIVs (584 strains from public databases). Our analyses revealed that the H7N3 AIVs had diverged into the North American lineage and the Eurasian lineage. These strains could be further classified into 26 genotypes (Supplementary Fig. 3 and Supplementary Data 10), with 14 belonging to the North American lineage and 12 belonging to the Eurasian lineage (Supplementary Fig. 3 and Supplementary Data 9 and 10). Our 31 H7N3 AIVs with whole genome (two isolates only had HA sequences) described here belonged to G11 (n = 30) and G12 (n = 1), respectively. They were different from a reassortant H7N3 strain identified from Japan, A/duck/Japan/AQ-HE30-1/2018(H7N3)27 (G10), in the PB2 gene. Dk/FJ/1.25 FZHX0009-C/2018(H7N3) (G12) differed from the remaining 30 H7N3 strains (G11) in the MP and NS genes. Therefore, all of these H7N3 strains were not closely related to H7 AIVs from other countries, such as Mexico and the USA, and were novel reassortants.All of the H5 viruses (n = 384) described in the present study possessed multiple basic amino acid residues at the cleavage site, whereas the H7N9 and H6Ny LPAIVs had less basic amino acids (PKGRGL or PQIETRGL). All of the H7N3 viruses (n = 33) also possessed multi-basic cleavage sites (PKRRRTARGL). Regarding the receptor-binding associated sites, 100% (401/401) of the H5 viruses had 226Q (H3 numbering). In all, 73.89% (116/157) of the H7 AIVs had 226L, and 99.36% (156/157) had 186V. All of the 33 H7N3 isolates possessed 186V and 226Q. Almost all 169 H6 strains possessed 190E, 226Q, and 228G (Supplementary Data 7).Receptor-binding properties of the major AIVsIn order to identify and provide early-warning of the potential public risks of the AIVs, a total of 43 representative strains including H9N9 (n = 7), H9N2 (n = 3), H5N6 (n = 8), H7N9 (n = 7), H7N3 (n = 9), H6N6 (n = 5), and H6N2 (n = 4) were selected for receptor-binding test using trisaccharide receptors.All tested H9 isolates possessed residue 226L (Supplementary Data 7). As expected, six H9N9 and two H9N2 testing strains (Ck/JX/08.24 NCDZT12X2-OC/2017(H9N9), Ck/JX/4.30 NCDZT44N2-OC/2017(H9N9), Ck/JX/4.30 NCDZT59N2-OC/2017(H9N9), Ck/JX/08.24 NCDZT49X2-OC/2017(H9N9), Ck/JX/6.26 NCDZT51R2-OC/2017(H9N9), Ck/JX/4.30 NCDZT36N2-OC/2017(H9N9), Ck/JX/8.26 NCDZTY76-O/2016(H9N2), and Ck/HuN/7.21 YYGKy9-O/2016(H9N2)) exclusively bound to human-type receptors (α2-6-SA). Only one H9N9 strain (Ck/JX/4.30 NCNP8N2-OC/2017(H9N9)) and one H9N2 (Ck/GD/4.18 SZBJ011-O/2018(H9N2)) presented a dual receptor-binding ability, with preference for human-type receptors (Fig. 5, Supplementary Fig. 4a, and Supplementary Data 8).Fig. 5: Receptor-binding properties of representative AIV isolates.a A/Anhui/1/2013(H7N9) was used as a reference for comparison with the tested H7 strains. Two human strains, A/California/04/2009(H1N1) and A/Vietnam/1194/2004(H5N1), were used as controls. b Receptor-binding properties of the representative AIV strains to human (α2-6-SA) and avian (α2-3-SA) receptors were tested using the solid-phase direct binding assay with trisaccharide receptors. Red and blue lines represent human- and avian-type receptors, respectively. Two replications presented similar results and the mean values were shown. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageAll tested H5N6 strains possessed 226Q and a loss of glycosylation site at the positions 158–160 (Supplementary Data 7), which mainly bound to avian-type receptors. As expected, the four tested strains (Dk/HuN/12.27 YYGK89J2-O/2016(H5N6), Gs/XJ/11.29 WLMQXL001-O/2017(H5N6), Gs/FJ/10.26 FZHX0002-C/2017(H5N6) (mixed Q (57.82%) and R (41.76%) at position 227), and Ck/SD/2.28 TAWM016-C/2017(H5N6)) displayed weak affinities to human-type receptors (Fig. 5, Supplementary Fig. 4a, and Supplementary Data 8).All seven H7N9 strains were found to possess the ability to bind both avian and human-type receptors. It was notable that four strains (Ev/JX/2.05 SRXZBJT038-E/2017(H7N9) (186V and 226L; mixed R (49.59%) and K (49.27%) at position 173), Ev/JL/04.11 CCHSL037-E/2018(H7N9) (186V and 226I), Ev/JX/2.16 SRGFYK089-E/2017(H7N9) (186V and 226L), and Ev/JX/1.11 NCDZT98F2-E/2017(H7N9) (186V, 226L, 122T, and 236I)) preferred binding to human-type receptors compared to the precursor A/Anhui/2013(H7N9) and other tested strains with 186V and 226L (Fig. 5, Supplementary Fig. 4a, and Supplementary Data 8), suggesting that the transmissibility from avian to humans may have increased for these H7N9 isolates. For the H7N3 reassortants with HA gene from H7N9 HPAIV, six of the nine strains (Dk/FJ/1.25 FZHX0049-O/2018(H7N3), Dk/FJ/1.25 FZHX0017-O/2018(H7N3), Dk/FJ/1.25 FZHX0011-O/2018(H7N3), Dk/FJ/1.25 FZHX0045-C/2018(H7N3), Dk/FJ/1.25 FZHX0014-C/2018(H7N3), and Dk/FJ/1.25 FZHX0046-O/2018(H7N3)) bound to both avian and human-type receptors and the affinities to avian-type receptors were slightly stronger than those to human-type receptors, whereas three strains (Dk/FJ/1.25 FZHX0005-O/2018(H7N3), Dk/FJ/1.25 FZHX0013-O/2018(H7N3), and Dk/FJ/1.25 FZHX0013-C/2018(H7N3)) only bound to avian-type receptors (Fig. 5, Supplementary Fig. 4, and Supplementary Data 8).For the H6 subtype, the tested strains also displayed diverse receptor-binding abilities. Three H6N6 strains with 190E and 228G (Dk/HuN/2.06 YYGK86J3-OC/2018(H6N6), Dk/JX/5.28 NCNP34N3-OC/2018(H6N6), and Dk/HuN/5.29 YYGK100P3-OC/2018(H6N6)) only bound to avian-type receptors. However, another two H6N6 strains also with 190E and 228G (Ck/HuN/1.12 YYGK22H3-OC/2018(H6N6) and Dk/HuN/11.30 YYGK54E3-OC/2018(H6N6)) possessed both avian- and human-type receptor-binding abilities and preferred avian-type receptors (Fig. 5, Supplementary Fig. 4, and Supplementary Data 8). In contrast to H6N6, all four H6N2 representative strains possessed double receptor-binding abilities. Gs/GD/10.21 SZBJ001-O/2016(H6N2) (190V and 228G) and Gs/GD/10.21 SZBJ001-C/2016(H6N2) (190V and 228G) possessed higher affinities to avian-type receptors, while Gs/GD/10.21 SZBJ004-O/2016(H6N2) (190A, 222I, and 228G) and Gs/GD/10.21 SZBJ003-O/2016(H6N2) (190V and 228S) displayed a preference for human-type receptors (Fig. 5, Supplementary Fig. 4, and Supplementary Data 8).The predominance of human-type receptor-binding preference of the tested H7N9, H9N2, and H9N9 strains was further confirmed using pentasaccharide receptors (Supplementary Fig. 4b). The receptor-binding affinities to both trisaccharide and pentasaccharide receptors were also similar for the tested strains of other subtypes, although Dk/FJ/1.25 FZHX0005-O/2018(H7N3) and Dk/HuN/2.06 YYGK86J3-OC/2018(H6N6) displayed slight binding avidities to human-type pentasaccharide receptors, compared with single affinities to avian-type trisaccharide receptors (Fig. 5, Supplementary Fig. 4, and Supplementary Data 8). These data indicated that many H5, H6, H7, and H9 AIVs have acquired a capability for binding to human-type receptors.DiscussionCompared to our previous study13, the AIV positive rates substantially decreased from 2016 to 2019. Several factors may have accounted for this decline. Due to LPMs as a transmission source and even potential incubator for human infections with AIV28,29, more and more provinces have started to close LPMs30,31,32 or take special measures at the human-animal interface to lower the risks of human infection. For example, the “1110” strategy for markets (cleaning every day, disinfecting every week, shutting down once per month, and butchering all unsold live birds before closing every day) was first proposed and implemented in Guangdong Province, China in 2014 (http://www.chinanews.com/fz/2014/12-06/6851778.shtml). Similar strategies have since been implemented in other Chinese provinces. In 2018, the Ministry of Agriculture of China required all Chinese provinces to implement the “1110” strategy (http://www.moa.gov.cnybgb/2018/201803/20180520180528_6143196.htm). In addition, the H5/H7 bivalent vaccine may have also contributed to the decreased AIV positive rates33. However, after using the H9 and H5 vaccines for ~2134 and 1535 years, respectively, these viruses are still circulating and evolving in China. Although the factors contributing to the decreased AIV positive rates in China need to be further investigated, the “1110” strategy may be effective, and lower AIV positive rates in LPMs would be expected as a result.Since 2016, the dominant AIV subtypes have substantially changed. During 2014–16, H9N2 and H5N6 were the dominant subtypes in Northern and Southern China, respectively13. However, the proportion of H9N2 AIVs gradually increased and has now become the most prevalent subtype in both Northern and Southern China. Coupled with the nation-wide and disordered transportation of poultry carrying H9N2, the emergence of H9N9 and H9N6 reassortants, and the dynamic reassortments among H9 and different AIV subtypes14,16, the circulation of H9 LPAIVs has become highly complicated in China. Remarkably, despite the widespread circulation of H7N9 AIVs during 2016–1723, it almost disappeared in 2018. The shift of the AIV subtypes in the poultry was not likely associated with intraspecies transmission between chicken and ducks, but may be caused by changes in the management of LPMs, the vaccination strategy, and different sensitivities of various viruses to the disinfectants used in the “1110” strategy. However, these results highlight the distinct change of the dominant AIV subtypes in China and will have a profound influence on prevention strategies against AIVs, including vaccine development and usage.Moreover, the emergence of a number of variants was notable, especially the H7N3 variant with an HA gene of the H7N9 HPAIV origin and the H5N6 variant. The antigenicity of these mutants, the effectiveness of the current H5/H7 bivalent vaccine against these variants, as well as the reason for H7N9 being replaced by H7N3, warrant further investigation. In addition, AIV isolation rates in the Yangtze River Delta and the South-Central regions only slightly decreased and were still higher than 20.00%. The co-infection or “impure” AIVs may also lead to antigenic or subtype shift. Including the present study, the existence of impure isolates with different subtypes has also been reported in many studies36,37. All the results highlight the necessity of constant surveillance of AIVs in LPMs.It is known that five out of the 12 AIV subtypes that have been detected in cases of human infections are H7 subtypes, including H7N2, H7N3, H7N4, H7N7, and H7N93,10,38,39,40. In this study, we revealed that five H7 (H7N2, H7N3, H7N6, H7N7, and H7N9) subtypes were co-detected in LPMs, in which most were isolated from ducks (except for H7N9), suggesting that ducks may also act as a “mixing vessel” for the H7 AIV reassortants. In fact, most of the other rare subtypes with diverse genetic constellations were also found in ducks. This may be partly due to the more contacts between domestic duck and wild waterfowl, which was considered as the natural reservoir of AIVs. H9N2 has also become the major subtype in ducks. Therefore, the probability of emergence of novel AIVs by reassortment among the diverse genetic constellations may likely be higher in ducks, not only because of the high diversity of AIV genetic constellation in ducks but also the excellent genetic compatibilities among H9N2 and other influenza subtypes including H7N9, pandemic H1N1, H5N1, H5N6, and so on13,16,41,42,43. Therefore, several AIV subtypes potentially infecting humans were circulating in LPMs and intensive surveillance of AIVs particularly among ducks should be performed continuously.Receptor binding was considered as the first step of influenza infection to host cells44,45,46,47. Almost all H9Ny isolates possessed 226L on HA, and all the tested H9N2 and H9N9 strains mainly bound to human-type receptors. 96.58% (113 out of 117) of the H7N9 isolates possessed both 186V and 226L, which were considered as the critical sites for human-type receptor binding of H7N9 AIVs46,48,49, and all the tested H7N9 strains presented affinities to both avian- and human-type receptors. Notably, several representative H7N9 strains during 2017–18 preferred human-type receptors, and the binding avidities were much stronger than a previous H7N9 strain (A/Shenzhen/Th001/2016), which also preferred to bind human-type receptors50. Six of the nine tested H7N3 HPAIVs displayed dual receptor-binding abilities though preference to avian-type receptors. This phenomenon was also seen in the H7N9 HPAIVs48,50,51, indicating potentially similar infectivity of H7N3 and H7N9 HPAIVs to the hosts.All the sequenced H5N6 strains had 226Q, while some tested strains presented slight preference for human-type receptor, which could be partly explained by the loss of a glycosylation site at the positions 158–16052,53,54. E190V and G228S mutations on HA contributed to the human-type receptor-binding abilities for H6 viruses55,56. Although almost H6 strains possessed 190E and 228G, several H6N2 strains were found to have E190V and/or G228S mutations, which could explain the dual receptor-binding ability. However, H6N6 strains with 190E and 228G were also found to bind to both receptors. Taken together, our receptor-binding tests highlight that only few AIV strains showed pure binding abilities to avian-type receptors, whereas the majority presented human-type receptor-binding capacity, particularly the dominant H9 AIVs. Therefore, despite lower positive rate in LPMs, AIVs showed increased abilities and risk to infect humans, which deserves closer attention.In summary, our latest nation-wide AIV surveillance data revealed a decrease of AIV positive rate and H9N2 has become the prevalent subtype throughout China. Most AIVs have obtained human-type receptor-binding abilities, including H5, H6, H7, and H9 subtypes, in which the H7N9 and H6N2 variants and almost all H9Ny strains preferred binding to human-type receptors. Furthermore, mutations associated with antigenic variation have been found in the H7N9, H7N3, and H5N6 variants. In fact, sporadic human cases caused by H7N9, H5N6, and H9N2 continue to be reported5,57, and the seroprevalence rate of H9N2 AIVs in the poultry workers posed an increasing trend after 2009 in China7,58. Therefore, constant monitoring on AIVs should be more closely conducted for agricultural and public health.MethodsEggsEmbryonated chicken eggs obtained from Beijing Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Company were incubated at 37 °C and 80% humidity for 10 days before being used for virus isolation.Sample collection and virus isolationOropharyngeal and cloacal swabs from apparently healthy poultry, as well as environmental samples, were collected in LPMs in 37 cities and counties across 23 provinces or municipalities or minority municipalities in China. Poultry included chickens, ducks, geese, and pigeons. Environmental samples included swabs from cages, poultry drinking water, defeathering machines, chopping boards, and feces in the LPMs. Sampling was collected from May 2016 to February 2019 (samples collected once a month, unless the LPM was closed, and there were no samples collected in the corresponding month), a period of 26 months spanning three flu seasons. Compared to our previous study, the same or nearby LPMs in Inner Mongolia, Jilin, Henan, Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, Sichuan, and Yunnan were chosen for sampling13. Furthermore, sampling was also performed in several additional provincial level administrative regions, including Xinjiang, Xizang, Qinghai, Guizhou, Hainan, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Ningxia, and Chongqing. The swabs were placed into viral transport media and transported to the laboratory within 24 h in a handheld portable 4 °C refrigerator, and frozen at −80 °C immediately for future use. Avian influenza viruses were isolated in 10-day-old specific pathogen-free (SPF) chicken embryos according to the WHO manual59. After culture, all the hemagglutinin-positive and -negative allantoic fluids were further tested by RT-PCR using universal primers13 targeting the PB1 and/or M gene as listed in Supplementary Data 11.Whole-genome sequencing of AIV isolatesViral RNA was extracted directly from AIV-positive allantoic fluid with MagaBio plus Virus RNA Purification Kit (BIOER, China). The whole-genome of AIV isolates were sequenced using Next generation sequencing (NGS)13. Briefly, RT-PCR and DNA synthesis were performed using the PrimeScript One Step RT-PCR kit (Takara). Next, the sequencing libraries were prepared. The libraries were sequenced on the BGI500 and Illumina HiSeq 4000. Sequencers by 200 bp or 250 bp paired-end sequencing, and sequencing depth for AIV isolates was about 0.2G per sample. The accuracy of the NGS method was confirmed by the published qRT-PCR method60 and qRT-PCR kits (Mabsky Biotech Co., Ltd.) with reference samples.Sequencing data assemblyRaw NGS reads were processed by filtering out low-quality reads (eight bases with quality <66), adapter-contaminated reads (with >15 bp matched to the adapter sequence), poly-Ns (with 8Ns), duplication and host contaminated reads (SOAP2 version 2.21; less than five mismatches)13,61. The filtered reads were mapped to the INFLUENZA database (downloaded on 1 June 2018)62 to choose best-matching reference sequences. Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA version 0.7.12)63 and SAMtools (version 1.4)64 were then used to perform reference-based assembly.Based on the NGS data, each cultured sample with ≥2 HA or NA subtypes was defined as “impure isolate”, while those with single HA and NA subtype were defined as “pure isolate”. The AIV positive samples are the cultured samples including both pure and impure isolates. The AIV positive rate was then calculated by “the numbers of AIV positive (cultured) samples” divided by “the total numbers of cultured samples”. The percentage of the impure or pure isolate was calculated as “the numbers of impure or pure isolates” divided by “the total number of AIV positive samples”.Phylogenetic analysesComplete genomes of the AIVs isolated in China were downloaded from the Influenza Virus Resource at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/FLU/Databaseph-select.cgi)62 and the GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org/)65 database on 2019. Repetitive sequences in the two databases were removed by matching strain names using Bioedit (version 7.1.3.0)66. Only full-length genomes were kept and sequence with obvious errors (e.g. frameshifts or total number of ambiguous bases >100) were excluded manually. The remaining sequences were combined with those generated in the present study, and the sequences of H9Ny, H5Ny, H7Ny, and H6Ny isolates were phylogenetically analyzed.Multiple sequence alignment was performed using Muscle (version 3.8.31)67 and then adjusted manually in Bioedit (version 7.1.3.0)66. Phylogenetic analysis of the aligned HA and NA datasets were performed using RAxML (version 8.1.6)68, with GTRGAMMA applied as the nucleotide substitution model with 100 bootstrap replicates. Trees were visualized using FigTree (version 1.4.3).The H5 clades in the phylogenetic trees were defined according to the nomenclature system proposed by FAO/WHO/OIE (https://www.who.int/influenza/gisrs_laboratory/h5_nomenclature_clade2344/en/) and previous publications13,69. The classification of Yangtze River Delta and Pearl River Delta lineages in HA genes of the human-infecting H7N9 AIVs are defined based on previous publications23,70,71. The HA and NA clades of H9N2 were defined based on pairwise distance between taxa calculated with default parameters in MEGA (version 5.2)72. A HA or NA clade was defined when the between-group distance was ≥1%.Receptor-binding assayThe pure isolates in different HA clades, within three passages and presenting ≥64 HA titers, were selected as the representative strains for receptor-binding testing using the solid-phase direct binding assay73. Briefly, 96-well microtiter plates were coated with biotinylated glycans α2-3-SA receptors (trisaccharide: Neu5Acα2-3Galβ1-4GlcNAcβ-SpNH-LC-LC-Biotin and pentasaccharide: NeuAcα2-3Galβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-3Galβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-SpNH-LC-LC-Biotin) and α2-6-SA receptors (trisaccharide: Neu5Acα2-6Galβ1-4GlcNAcβ-SpNH-LC-LC-Biotin and pentasaccharide: NeuAcα2-6Galβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-3Galβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-SpNH-LC-LC-Biotin). Virus dilutions containing 64 HA units with the NAIs (10 μM each of Oseltamivir and Zanamivir) were incubated. Virus-receptor-binding was detected with rabbit antisera against the influenza viruses (H1, H5, H6, H7, or H9, CASCIRE)74 and HRP-linked goat-anti-rabbit antibody (Bioeasytech). HRP-linked goat-anti-rabbit antibody was diluted 2000 times in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA). The results were measured by tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) at 450 nm. A/Anhui/1/2013(H7N9) was used as a reference for comparison with the tested H7 strains. Two human strains, A/California/04/2009(H1N1) and A/Vietnam/1194/2004(H5N1) were used as control.Biosafety statement and facilityRoutine surveillance samples were processed in the biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) labs of CASCIRE. Coveralls, gloves, and N95 masks were used during the working in BSL-2 labs, and all wastes were autoclaved. The experiments with live H7N9, H7N3, and H5N6 viruses were conducted in biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) labs of CASCIRE or CASCIRE Network Surveillance Unit (NSU). This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (SQIMCAS2016016).Measures against cross-contaminationFirst, during the sample collection process, all the tubes with samples were placed into different cells in sample box. Second, our longitude study included >16,000 samples, however, samples were not detected at the same time. In fact, samples from the same site were detected as soon as possible after collection by month, and usually no more than 200 samples were identified in each experiment. Third, before the inoculation or identification of the original and cultured samples, the surfaces of tubes were disinfected with disinfectant (Benzalkonium bromide or 75% alcohol). Fourth, RNAs were extracted by an automatic nucleic acid purification machine (Nucleic Acid Purification System NPA-32) rather than manually. Fifth, all the experiments associated with original and cultured samples, as well as RNAs (sample handling, virus isolation, PCR system preparation, and NGS library preparation), were performed in biosafety cabinets with tweezers and tips with filters. Tubes with samples were centrifuged at 5000 × g for ~10 s, and then were opened using tweezers, which will be disinfected by flameless infrared heater after each usage. In addition, disposable coveralls, N95 marks (Zhuozhou Fumeishendun Biotechnology Co., Ltd., China), and double-deck gloves (the inner shorter gloves cover the cuff by adhesive tape, and the outer longer gloves also cover the cuff but without adhesive tape for easy changing if they were contaminated) were strictly dressed in each experiment.

Soares1 Show authors Scientific Reports volume 10, Article number: 20082 (2020) Cite this article 3495 Accesses 17 Citations Metrics details Subjects BiochemistryBiophysicsChemistryComputational biology and bioinformaticsMolecular medicine AbstractThe influenza virus fusion process, whereby the virus fuses its envelope with the host endosome membrane to release the genetic material, takes place in the acidic late endosome environment. Acidification triggers a large conformational change in the fusion protein, hemagglutinin (HA), which enables the insertion of the N-terminal region of the HA2 subunit, known as the fusion peptide, into the membrane of the host endosome. However, the mechanism by which pH modulates the molecular properties of the fusion peptide remains unclear. To answer this question, we performed the first constant-pH molecular dynamics simulations of the influenza fusion peptide in a membrane, extending for 40 µs of aggregated time. The simulations were combined with spectroscopic data, which showed that the peptide is twofold more active in promoting lipid mixing of model membranes at pH 5 than at pH 7.4. The realistic treatment of protonation introduced by the constant-pH molecular dynamics simulations revealed that low pH stabilizes a vertical membrane-spanning conformation and leads to more frequent contacts between the fusion peptide and the lipid headgroups, which may explain the increase in activity. The study also revealed that the N-terminal region is determinant for the peptide’s effect on the membrane.

Currently there is no universal and effective therapy against this virus and, thus, it is crucial to obtain a detailed understanding of the infectious process and its key players. One important step of this process is the fusion between the viral and host membranes, catalyzed by the fusion protein hemagglutinin, which is one of the most promising drug targets against this virus2. Hemagglutinin is a homotrimer and each monomer is composed of two polypeptide chains, named HA1 and HA2, connected by a disulfide bond. HA1 is responsible for binding to the sialic acid receptors on the host membrane, whereas HA2 contains the fusion machinery3. After binding to the receptors on the host cell, the influenza virus is uptaken by endocytosis. Release of the genetic material of the virus into the host cell occurs at the endosome membrane level. At the late endosomes there is a pH drop to a value of around 5 that triggers a large conformational change of HA, which is crucial for the fusion process3.The first 23 amino acid residues of HA2 are particularly important in the fusion process, since this region inserts into the host membrane, promoting fusion and is, therefore, known as the fusion peptide4. This region is very conserved across different hemagglutinin subtypes (18 out of 23 residues are strictly conserved among all influenza A strains) and several mutations have been shown to abolish or impair its function4. Several in-vitro studies have shown that the isolated fusion peptide promotes lipid mixing of large unilamellar vesicles, which evidences that the peptide induces hemifusion, even in the absence of the rest of hemagglutinin5,6,7,8. The peptide structure in detergent micelles has been analyzed by NMR studies; it has a helix-turn-helix structure in which the angle between the helices depends on the peptide length9,10,11,12. A 20-residue long fusion peptide (HAfp-20) adopts an open inverted-V structure at pH 59, whereas a 23-residue long peptide (HAfp-23) displays a more closed helical-hairpin structure, both at pH 4 and 7.410.A crucial issue that remains unclear is the orientation adopted by the fusion peptide in the membrane bilayer, as it is determinant for peptide-induced perturbation of lipid bilayers13. Based on the NOE interactions between the amide protons of the HAfp-23 and dodecylphosphocholine micelle protons, Lorieau et al. concluded that one of the peptide sides is exposed to water and postulated that the peptide adopts an interfacial conformation10. However, since their results were obtained in a micelle environment, which has a very different structure from a membrane bilayer, having a single lipidic layer and a considerably higher curvature, it is not clear if the peptide adopts this type of arrangement in the membrane. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations performed by us, indicated that the peptide can adopt two different conformations in a membrane bilayer: an interfacial orientation, parallel to the membrane surface and a membrane-spanning orientation, perpendicular to the bilayer14. Subsequent simulation studies by Worch et al. using temperature replica exchange molecular dynamics also found that the influenza fusion peptide can adopt these two configurations and indicate that he membrane-spanning configuration corresponds to the lowest free energy minimum for the 23-residue long fusion peptide with a charged N-terminus15,16.The mechanism by which the peptide induces lipid mixing is not fully elucidated, but several recent experimental and computational studies have suggested different modes of action, including altering the membrane curvature, increasing or decreasing lipid order or inducing pore formation and stabilization14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26. A mechanism that has been proposed based on molecular dynamics (MD) simulations asserts that lipid tail protrusion (i.e. a lipid acyl chain that extends to and beyond the corresponding phosphate group) is a determinant step in membrane fusion19. The occurrence of lipid tail protrusion has been observed in several simulation studies of the influenza fusion peptide in membrane bilayers, which indicates that the peptide increases the probability of protrusion events7,14,18,27. It has also been shown that the peptide interacts with the lipid headgroups, mainly through the N-terminal group, which induces these headgroups to penetrate deeper into the membrane (headgroup intrusion)7,14,20,27. A recent study using multiscale simulations indicates that hemagglutinin-catalyzed membrane fusion is a two-stage process: first lipid-tail protrusion induced by the fusion peptide catalyzes stalk formation and second, the fusion peptide and transmembrane domain interact with the distal membrane leaflet leading to hemifusion diaphragm formation and fusion pore opening27. This study also shows that the protonation of the N-terminal site strongly influences the ability of the peptide to interact with the distal membrane leaflet and promote stalk widening27.Although the detailed mechanism of the pH-induced conformational change of hemagglutinin has not been elucidated, it seems clear that it involves the weakening of the interaction between HA1 head region and the HA2 stalk, plus the weakening of the contacts between the fusion peptide and the surrounding residues. This effect ultimately leads to the conversion of the hemagglutinin structure into an extended conformation, in which the fusion peptide is located at the tip and inserts into the host membrane3. It is not clear if the pH drop affects the fusion peptide itself, although studies have shown that the isolated peptide is more active at low pH, indicating that pH does indeed affect the peptide's properties5,6,8,28,29.In this work, we conducted a thorough analysis of the effect of pH on the influenza fusion peptide properties, by combining experimental data from biophysical techniques with results from constant-pH molecular dynamics (cpHMD) simulations. A Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)-based analysis revealed that the percentage of peptide-induced lipid mixing is twofold higher at pH 5 relative to pH 7.4. The cpHMD simulations elucidated the effect of pH on the peptide properties and allowed us to perform a detailed characterization of the peptide-membrane interaction and pinpoint the residues which are crucial for the peptide’s ability to interact with and perturb the host membrane.Materials and methodsMaterialsThe peptide used in this study corresponds to the first 23 residues of the HA2 subunit of the influenza subtype H1, flanked by a serine residue (GLFGAIAGFIEGGWTGMIDGWYGS). This peptide is identical to the one that was studied by Lorieau et al.10, without the 6 residue-long hydrophilic tail that was added in their study. The peptide was purchased with purity higher than 95% from JPT Peptide Technologies GmbH (Berlin, Germany) and used directly as supplied from the manufacturer.1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (POPE) were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Dipalmitoylphosphatidylehtanolamine-sulforhodamine B (RhB-PE) and 1,2-dihexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho[N-4-nitrobenz- 2-oxa-1,3-diazolyl]ethanolamine (NBD-PE) were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Acetate buffer (20 mM sodium acetate, 150 mM NaCl, pH 5) was used in the measurements performed at pH 5 and HEPES buffer (10 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4) was used in the measurements performed at pH 7.4. Peptide stock solutions were prepared by dissolving the peptide in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) before dilution with the buffer. The solubilization of all peptides was improved with mild bath sonication. Fluorescence spectroscopy measurements were conducted at room temperature in a Varian Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer (Mulgrave, Australia). All the experimental assays were conducted in triplicate.Membrane interaction studiesMembrane partition studies were carried out with large unilamellar vesicles composed of POPC/POPE 50:50 (mol%). Large unilamellar vesicles with ~ 100 nm diameter were obtained by extrusion techniques30. The studies were performed by adding small volumes of concentrated large unilamellar vesicles stock solutions to the peptide samples at 16 μM, with a 10 min incubation before measurements. Fluorescence emission spectra were scanned in the 300–450 nm range with an excitation wavelength of 280 nm. The fluorescence intensities were corrected for successive dilutions, background intensities and scatter. Partition curves were plotted, and the partition coefficient, Kp, was determined as previously described31 to compare the membrane affinity of the peptide at different pH values.Lipid mixingTo study the fusion peptide’s ability to induce lipid mixing at different pH values, a Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)-based assay was used as previously described32. This assay is based on the decrease in resonance energy transfer between two membrane probes, RhB-PE and NBD-PE, when the lipids of the vesicles labeled with both probes are allowed to mix with lipids from unlabeled vesicles. The concentration of each of the fluorescent probes within the pre-fusion large unilamellar vesicles membrane was 0.6 mol%. For this assay large unilamellar vesicles composed of POPC/POPE 50:50 (mol%) was used and prepared as described above. Labeled and unlabeled vesicles in a proportion of 1:4 were used at a total final lipid concentration of 100 µM. The fluorescence was measured with excitation at 470 nm and emission recorded between 500 and 650 nm. Phospholipid mixing was quantified on a percentage basis:$$\% {\text{Fusion efficiency}} = \left( {{\text{R}} - {\text{R}}_{0} } \right)/({\text{R}}_{{{1}00\% }} - {\text{R}}_{0} )$$where R is the value of the ratio between the fluorescence intensity with emission at 530 nm and 588 nm, corresponding to the maximum fluorescence emission of NBD and RhB, respectively, obtained 10 min after the peptide’s addition (at a final concentration of 16 µM) to a mixture containing large unilamellar vesicles having 0.6 mol% of each probe plus large unilamellar vesicles without any fluorescent probe. R0 is the ratio before peptide addition (constant during the evaluated time range), and R100% the ratio after addition of Triton X-100 at a final concentration of 1% (v/v).Secondary structure analysis by FTIR spectroscopyFourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was used to analyze the peptide secondary structure as described in a previous work7. Attenuated total reflection Fourier-transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectra were obtained on a Bruker Tensor27 Bio ATR II spectrophotometer (Ettlingen, Germany) equipped with a MCT detector (broad band 1200–420 cm−1, liquid N2 cooled) at a resolution of 4 cm−1. The spectrometer was continuously purged with dry air. The internal reflection element was a silicone (Si) ATR plate. Peptide samples (at 0.5 mg/mL) in the absence and presence of POPC large unilamellar vesicles (2 mg/mL) were prepared in buffer, spread on the Si plate and dried until solvent evaporation. POPC large unilamellar vesicles were prepared as described above. For each spectrum a total of 120 scans (900–4000 cm−1) were averaged. Background of the internal reflection element was collected and subtracted to the samples. The determination of protein secondary structures was performed by deconvolution of the curve-fitting of the amide I band with Lorentzian functions.Constant-pH molecular dynamics simulationsTwo sets of constant-pH molecular dynamics (cpHMD) simulations of the fusion peptide in a 1,2-Dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC) membrane were performed, starting from two different orientations of the peptide in the membrane, which were obtained in a previous study and correspond to the final states of the productive replicates 1 and 4 analyzed in that work14. In that study we analyzed the peptide’s orientation in the membrane using atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, in which the lipids and water molecules started randomly distributed in the simulation box and were allowed to spontaneously assemble. Using this approach, we observed that the membrane spontaneously assembled around the peptide in 5 out of 10 simulations (productive replicates). In 4 out of the 5 productive replicates the peptide adopted a membrane-spanning and nearly vertical conformation, whereas in 1 of the replicates it adopted a more horizontal configuration, occupying only one membrane leaflet. These two states did not interconvert in 500 ns of MD simulation, which indicates that they are separated by a high energy barrier. Subsequent simulation studies by another group supported the existence of these two states and predicted that the membrane-spanning configuration corresponds to the lowest free energy minimum, which is separated from the other state by a high energy barrier of over 20 kJ/mol15,16.In the present work we analyzed the effect of pH on the two configurations adopted by the peptide in the membrane and used both of them as starting points of the cpHMD simulations. Thus, we setup two simulation sets, starting from the final states of the productive replicates 1 and 4 analyzed in the previous work14 These two sets of simulations are herein labelled set H (corresponding to a nearly horizontal starting orientation) and set V (corresponding to a nearly vertical starting orientation) (Fig. 1)—the PDB files of the starting configurations are available in supporting information and named start_H.pdb and start_v.pdb. Four different pH values were considered and five independent replicates were simulated at each pH value for each simulation set (a detailed description of the simulation setup is provided as Supporting Information). Given that fusion of the influenza membrane with the host membrane takes place at the endosome, we selected a pH range that includes the endosome pH (~ 5) and we also included pH 7 since we wanted to compare the peptide behavior in these two pH conditions. Additionally, we included the pH values 3 and 9 to analyze the effect of more extreme pH conditions and to be able to analyze the titration curves and predict the pKa values of the relevant titrable residues present in this peptide.Figure 1Starting configurations of the influenza fusion peptide in constant pH molecular dynamics simulations. These two configurations were obtained in a previous study14 and were used to initialize the two sets of simulations described in this work: set H (left) and set V (right). The molecular images of the two starting conformations were built with PyMOL33, using the final structures of replicates 1 (set V) and 4 (set H), obtained in a the previous study. The fusion peptide is shown using a cartoon representation colored in salmon and the lipid P and N atoms are depicted by transparent spheres colored in orange and blue, respectively. The titrable residues that were analyzed in this study are highlighted using sticks.Full size imageThe cpHMD method used in this work combines a stochastic titration methodology (based on continuum electrostatics and Monte Carlo calculations) with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations34,35,36,37. These calculations are run in a cycle where three block steps are sequentially repeated several times: (1) a Poisson–Boltzmann/Monte Carlo (PB/MC) block that assigns the protonation state of each residue in a given conformation, based on protonation free energy calculations performed with a continuum electrostatics method and Monte-Carlo simulations to sample protonation states; (2) a solvent relaxation block corresponding to a short MD simulation (0.1 ps in the present work), with all the system frozen except for the solvent, which enables the solvent molecules to adapt to the new protonation state; (3) an unconstrained MD simulation block (10 ps in the present work), which is used to sample new conformations with the protonation state assigned in step (1). The cpHMD simulations were run until the average protonation was reasonably converged, as discussed in the results section, which resulted in individual simulation lengths of 1 µs per replicate, with a combined simulation time that amounts to 40 µs.PB/MC settingsThe MEAD package38 version 2.2.9 was used to calculate the PB-derived energy terms, using atomic charges and radii derived from the GROMOS 54A7 force field39, and the pKa values of model compounds described in Table 1 of reference40. The molecular surface was computed by considering a rolling probe of radius 1.4 Å, and the Stern layer was 2 Å. The temperature and ionic strength were set to 310 K and 0.1 M, respectively, and the dielectric constants assigned to the molecular interior and the solvent were set to 2 and 80, respectively. A finite difference method was used to solve the PB linear equation using a two-step focusing procedure, using grid spacings of 1.0 and 0.25 Å, with a total of 81 grid points in each step. The software PETIT41 was used to sample the protonation states using 100,000 Monte Carlo steps in each calculation. At each step all individual sites and site pairs with coupling above 2.0 pKa units were allowed to change to a random protonation state (including tautomeric forms)41,42 and a Metropolis criterion43 was used to accept or reject the new protonation state.Table 1 pKa values computed from constant pH MD simulations. The pKa values and the respective errors were calculated as described in reference54. The Tyr22 pKa values are not defined in the pH range analyzed because this residue remained fully protonated at all pH values.Full size tableMM/MD settingsThe molecular dynamics simulations were performed with the GROMACS44 package version 4.0.745 with an integration timestep of 2 fs and using periodic boundary conditions. The GROMOS 54A739 force field was used to model the peptide, the SPC model was used for water46 and the DMPC parameters used were the ones developed by Poger et al.47,48. A twin-range cutoff of 8/14 Å was used for nonbonded interactions, updating the neighbor list at every 5 simulation steps. Long-range electrostatic interactions were treated with the Generalized Reaction Field method49, setting the dielectric constant to 6247,48 and the ionic strength to 0.1 M. Temperature coupling was applied separately to the peptide, membrane and solvent atoms, using the v-rescale algorithm50, setting the reference temperature to 310 K and using a temperature coupling constant of 0.1 ps. The pressure was kept at 1 bar using the Parrinelo-Rahman coupling scheme51 applied independently in the XY and Z directions, with a coupling constant of 5 ps and an isothermal compressibility of 4.6 × 10–5 bar. All the bonds were constrained using the LINCS algorithm52, except for water molecules that were constrained using the SETTLE algorithm53.ResultsPartition coefficients of the influenza fusion peptide measured using fluorescence spectroscopyGiven that the influenza fusion peptide is intrinsically fluorescent due to the presence of tryptophan residues, fluorescence emission spectroscopy was used to study the interaction of the peptide with POPC/POPE large unilamellar vesicles at endosome mimetic pH (5.0) and at pH 7.4. The fluorescence quantum yield of the Trp residue is affected by the insertion of the peptides in the membrane and fluorescence emission intensity can, therefore, be used to estimate the peptide partition coefficient (Kp) between the aqueous and lipid phases. The partition coefficients at pH 5 and 7.4 were determined to quantify the extent of the peptides incorporation in large unilamellar vesicles. The results obtained show that the peptide has a slightly higher affinity for POPC/POPE large unilamellar vesicles at pH 7.4 ((2.9 ± 0.4) × 104) when compared to pH 5 ((1.0 ± 0.1) × 104).Fusogenic activity of the influenza fusion peptide analyzed by a FRET-based assayIn order to study the peptide’s fusogenic activity, a FRET-based assay was performed using POPC/POPE large unilamellar vesicles to determine the percentage of lipid mixing at pH 5.0 and 7.4. The curves displayed in Fig. 2 were used to calculate the percentage of lipid mixing as described in the “Materials and methods” section. The results show that the percentage of lipid mixing at pH 5 is 42.8 ± 1.7%, whereas at pH 7.4 the value drops to 23.9 ± 1.8%. Since the fusion peptide partition coefficient follows an inverse trend, the higher peptide fusion efficiency observed at pH 5 cannot be attributed to a higher affinity for the membrane. This indicates that, although the peptide interacts less with the lipid bilayer at pH 5 than at pH 7.4, it is more efficient in perturbing the membrane and inducing lipid mixing at the endosome mimetic pH.Figure 2Spectral representation of efficiency of fusion in FRET-based assays in the presence of the influenza fusion peptide. To study the peptide’s ability to induce lipid mixing at pH 5 (red line) and pH 7.4 (green line), a Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)-based assay was used as previously described32. large unilamellar vesicles labeled with 0.6% mol of RhB-PE and NBD-PE were mixed with unlabeled liposomes to a final proportion of 1:4 and the energy transfer assay was evaluated in the presence of the fusion peptide after 10 min of incubation. The % fusion efficiency was calculated at different peptide concentrations as described in the Materials and Methods section. Each point corresponds to the average value of three independent replicates and bars represent the corresponding standard deviation. The data at pH 5.0 has been collected in a previous work7 and is shown here for comparison with the data obtained at pH 7.4.Full size imageInfluenza fusion peptide secondary structure analyzed by FTIRThe secondary structure of the influenza fusion peptide was analyzed by ATR-FTIR spectroscopy. The spectra of the peptide in the presence of POPC large unilamellar vesicles were collected at pH 5.0 and 7.4 (Fig. 3). The wavenumber ranges of the amide I absorption bands indicate that the peptide adopts a predominantly α-helical conformation in both pH conditions. The peak obtained at pH 5 is centered at 1664 cm−1, whereas the peak obtained at 7.4 is centered at 1657 cm−1 and is broader.Figure 3ATR-FTIR amide I band for the influenza fusion peptide in presence of POPC large unilamellar vesicles. Attenuated total reflection infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectra were obtained on a Bruker Tensor27 Bio ATR II spectrophotometer at a resolution of 4 cm−1 as described in the Materials and Methods section. All the spectra were normalized and the samples were prepared in pH 5.0 (red line) and pH7.4 (green line). The spectrum at pH 5.0 has been collected in a previous work7 and is shown here for comparison with the spectrum obtained at pH 7.4.Full size imageTemporal evolution of the fusion peptide properties in constant-pH molecular dynamics simulationsTo shed light into the molecular details underlying the pH effect on the peptide’s structural properties and its interaction with the membrane, we performed constant-pH molecular dynamics simulations (CpHMD) simulations. Previously, we had observed that the fusion peptide can adopt two different configurations in the membrane: an interfacial conformation where the peptide has a parallel orientation relative to the membrane plane; and a membrane-spanning conformation where it adopts a nearly vertical orientation (Fig. 1)14. In our previous study, these two configurations did not interconvert, which indicates that they are separated by a high-energy barrier. Subsequent studies by another group have made similar observations and predicted that the membrane spanning configuration is the most probable configuration of the fusion peptide with a protonated N-terminal and that the energy barrier separating the two states is higher than 20 kJ/mol15,16. In the present work, we decided to perform cpHMD simulations starting from each one of these two configurations, which are labelled as set H (for the interfacial horizontal configuration) and set V (for the vertical membrane-spanning configuration). Given that fusion of the influenza plasma membrane with the host membrane takes place at the endosome, we selected a pH range that includes the endosome pH (~ 5) and we also included pH 7 since it corresponds to a neutral pH. Additionally, we included the pH values 3 and 9 to analyze the effect of more extreme pH conditions and to be able to analyze the titration curves and predict the pKa values of the relevant titrable residues present in this peptide. Five independent simulations of 1 μs were performed at each pH, for each starting configuration.The RMSD analysis (Fig. 4) shows that in the simulation set H the fusion peptide is stable between pH 3 and pH 7, whereas in one of the replicates at pH 9, the structure changed considerably and, visual inspection indicated that the C-terminal helix became unfolded. In the simulation set V, the peptide is very stable at pH 5 (corresponding to the endosome pH), in which the peptide was shown to be more active. At this pH value, all the replicates have low RMSD values. A larger heterogeneity among replicates is observed at the other pH values (3, 7 and 9) and the peptide is more unstable at pH 9, as observed for the simulation set H. Overall, these results indicate that the peptide is stable in the pH range 3–7, becoming more unstable at pH 9. However, we note that the peptide is still mainly helical, even at high pH, and the unfolding of the C-terminal helix was observed in only 2 out of 10 replicates at pH 9. These results are in line with the FTIR data showing that the peptide is helical at both pH 5 and 7.4 and that the spectra obtained at pH 7.4 is broader than the one obtained at pH 5, which indicates that at higher pH other types of structural elements might be present, including unstructured regions.Figure 4Temporal evolution of the Cα root mean square deviation in constant pH MD simulations. The root mean square deviation (RMSD) was calculated with the GROMACS g_rmsd tool, using the starting structure of each simulation as the reference structure, excluding the initialization steps from the calculation. Only the Cα atoms were used for fitting and for the RMSD calculations. The plots on the left and right columns correspond to the simulation sets H and V, respectively and each row corresponds to a given pH: pH 3 (1st row), pH 5 (2nd row), pH 7 (3rd row), pH 9 (4th row). Each plot line corresponds to an independent replicate simulation performed in the same conditions (red: replicate 1; orange: replicate 2; yellow: replicate 3; green: replicate 4 and blue: replicate 5).Full size imageTo analyze the peptide orientation in the membrane during the simulation, we measured the tilt angle between the N and C-terminal helices and the membrane plane (Figures S1 and S2 in Supporting Information). The plots show that in the simulation set H the peptide remains horizontal at all pH values, although the tilt angle slightly increases with pH. In the simulation set V, at low pH (3 and 5) the peptide maintains a high tilt angle throughout the simulations, whereas at pH 7 and 9, in some replicates, the tilt angle decreases during the simulation, which means that the peptide adopts a more horizontal orientation.In cpHMD simulations, the protonation states of titrable residues can change during the simulation and the average proton occupancies at different pH values can be computed. Given that fusion of the influenza plasma membrane with the host membrane takes place at the endosome (pH ~ 5), we focused our analysis on the sites that may be titrable in the pH range 3–9, namely the N-terminal site of Gly1, the side-chain carboxyl groups of Glu11 and Asp19, the side-chain hydroxyl group of Tyr22 and the C-terminal site of the flanking residue Ser24.The analysis of the average protonation over time (Figures S3 and S4 in Supporting Information) indicates that Tyr-22 remains fully protonated over all the pH values analyzed, in both simulation sets, indicating that this residue is not titrable in a biologically relevant pH range. Therefore, we could not compute the titration curve for this residue and it was not taken into account in subsequent analysis. All the other sites displayed different protonation profiles at different pH values and their titration curves and membrane-effect were further investigated.Residue titration curves computed from cpHMD simulationsThe average protonation values over the last 400 ns of simulation (Figure S5) were used to compute the titration curves of the titrable sites: N and C-terminus and the side chain carboxyl groups of Glu11 and Asp19 (Fig. 5). The analysis of the titration curves reveals that Glu11 displays similar protonation behaviors in the two sets of simulations (set H and set V), whereas differences can be observed in N-ter, C-ter and Asp19 protonation curves in the two simulation sets, which are more accentuated in the case os Asp19.Figure 5Titration curves computed from constant-pH MD simulations. The plots show the titration curves computed for each titrable group: N-terminal amine (N-ter), side chain carboxyl groups of Glu11 (Glu11) and Asp19 (Asp 19), side chain hydroxyl group of Tyr22 (Tyr22) and C-terminal carboxyl group of Ser24 (C-ter). The points represent average proton occupancies over the last 400 ns of simulation over all the replicates performed in each condition and the lines are the corresponding Hill curve fits. The blue and red colors represent the simulation sets H and V, respectively. The average protonation values obtained for each replicate at each pH value are shown in figure S5.Full size imageThe titration curves of the N-terminal site show that the proton occupancy at neutral pH (7) is different from that observed at the endosome pH (~ 5)55, particularly in the simulation set H. Analyzing the N-terminus titration curves in more detail shows that in the simulation set H the protonation probabilities at pH values 3, 5 and 7 are 1, 0.84 and 0.22, respectively and in the simulation set V the protonation probabilities are 1, 1 and 0.65 for the same pH values. This indicates that at low pH the N-terminal site has a greater tendency to be protonated, particularly, when it adopts a horizontal conformation. The computed pKa value of the N-terminal site in simulation sets H and V are 6.14 ± 0.53 and 7.24 ± 0.16, respectively (Table 1), which is lower than the value of 8.8 obtained in a previous NMR study11. However, we note that in that study the peptide was in a detergent micelle and had a lysine tail attached, which may influence the results.The titration curves show that Glu11 is mostly protonated in the pH range between 5 and 7. On the other hand, the protonated fraction of Asp19 changes considerably in this pH range and the curves obtained for the simulations sets H and V are different. This residue is located near the center of the C-terminal helix, on the exterior face of the fusion peptide (Fig. 1). In the horizontal configuration, it is located in the headgroup region and exposed to the solvent, whereas in the vertical configuration it is buried inside the membrane (Fig. 1) and, thus, has a higher tendency to protonate. Glu11 and Asp19 have considerably higher pKa values than the typical values for these amino acid residues in water (Table 1). This is due to the fact that, in the systems studied here, they are exposed to the hydrophobic membrane environment and, thus, have a higher tendency to protonate and become neutral. A previous NMR study has also shown that these residues have high pKa values11, particularly in the case of Glu11, although the values obtained in that study (5.31 and 4.35 for Glu11 and Asp19, respectively) are lower than the ones computed in the present work. As explained above, these differences can be due to the fact that the peptide tested by NMR contained a lysine-tail (to make it more soluble) and the experiments were done in dodecylphosphocholine micelles. Overall, this analysis indicates that the protonated fractions of the N-terminal and the Asp19 sites change considerably between pH 5 and 7, which can be linked to the activity difference observed in this pH range, in our FRET-based analysis.As mentioned above, Tyr22 remains fully protonated in the pH range analyzed and could not be titrated. Regarding the C-terminal site, the estimated pKa values for the simulation sets H and V are 3.95 + − 0.07 and 5.12 + − 0.16, respectively. These results are representative of the model peptide that was used in the experimental analysis presented in this manuscript. However, we note that, during the infection process, the fusion peptide is attached to the rest of the hemagglutinin protein through the C-terminal side and is not titrable. For this reason, the protonation profile of the C-terminus site shown in Fig. 5 cannot be extrapolated to a biological context.Effect of pH on the fusion peptide structural properties: the vertical conformation is more stable at low pHGiven that there is a close link between protonation and solvent exposure, we analyzed the solvent accessible surface area (SASA) of the peptide in different pH conditions, in the two sets of simulations (Fig. 6). In the simulation set H, the peptide is located just below the head groups, with one face exposed to the solvent. Our analysis shows that in these simulations the peptide has a large solvent accessible surface, which does not change considerably with pH.Figure 6Average solvent accessible surface area of the fusion peptide in constant-pH MD simulations. The fusion peptide solvent accessible surface area (SASA) was computed with the GROMACS g_sas tool, which implements the algorithm described by Eisenhaber et al.56 The average SASA value for each replicate at each pH value was calculated over the last 400 ns of simulation for the simulation set H (left side) and V (right side). Each point corresponds to an independent replicate simulation performed in a given pH value (the color codes used are describe in Fig. 4) and the black line passes through the average value computed over all the replicates simulated at a given pH value.Full size imageInterestingly, in the simulation set V, the peptide’s solvent accessible surface area changes considerably with pH. At low pH (3 and 5), the peptide has a considerably lower solvent accessible surface area relative to the simulation set H, since it remains deeply inserted in the membrane and shielded from the solvent throughout the simulations. At pH 7, the replicates have a heterogeneous behavior: three replicates have a high solvent accessible surface area and two replicates have a lower solvent accessible surface area. At pH 9, the peptide has a high solvent accessible surface area in all replicates, in the same range observed in the simulation set H. To gain further insight into this matter, we built scatter plots of the average solvent accessible surface area vs average protonation of each residue for the simulation sets H and V (Figure S6 in Supporting Information). The results show that in the simulation set H there is no apparent correlation between these two properties. In the simulation set V, on the other hand, a correlation between the two properties is observed, in particular, for the Asp19 residue. This can be explained by the fact that at high pH values Asp19 becomes deprotonated and charged and has a higher tendency to interact with water molecules.Analyzing the water density across the membrane (Figure S7 in Supporting Information), we can see that in the simulation set H there is no water in the center of the membrane, as is usually the case in membrane simulations. However, in the simulation set V, the presence of water molecules in the bilayer center depends on pH: at low pH the water density is approximately zero, whereas at high pH the average water density increases.To examine how pH affects the orientation of the peptide in the membrane, we measured the average tilt angles of the two peptide helices (labelled N-terminal and C-terminal helix, respectively), after equilibration (Fig. 7). In the simulation set H, the N-terminal helix displays a low tilt angle relative to the membrane plane (corresponding to a horizontal orientation) at all pH values. The C-terminal helix also displays a low tilt angle at all pH values, although it becomes slightly more tilted as the pH increases. In the simulation set V, we observe that the orientation of the peptide in the membrane is strongly affected by pH. At low pH values, both the N-terminal and the C-terminal helices display a high tilt angle in the membrane, compatible with a nearly vertical conformation, while at higher pH several replicates display lower tilt angles relative to the membrane plane. This behavior is clearly shown in the plots of the C-terminal helix. At pH 3 and 5 this helix adopts a large tilt angle in all the replicates, whereas in the simulations at pH 7 and 9 more than half of the replicates become considerably less tilted, having average tilt angles comparable with those observed in the simulation set H. These results indicate that as the pH increases the peptide tends to deviate from the vertical conformation (a movie illustrating this behavior is available in the supporting information – movie S1). Interestingly, there is a correlation between the average protonation of Asp19 and the tilt angle adopted by the peptide at pH 7, i.e. the replicates in which Asp19 is frequently deprotonated adopt more horizontal orientations (Fig. 8). Since this residue is located in the middle of the C-terminal helix, it stands close to the bilayer center when the peptide adopts a vertical orientation (Fig. 1). At high pH, Asp19 is frequently deprotonated becoming negatively charged, which makes the vertical orientation, where this residue is exposed to the membrane interior, more unstable.Figure 7Average tilt angle of the fusion peptide in constant-pH MD simulations. The tilt angles for the N and C-terminal helices were computed as described in Figures S1 and S2 (Supporting Information), respectively, and averaged over the last 400 ns of simulation. The plots correspond to the tilt angle of each of these helices in the two simulation sets: N-terminal helix in simulation set H (top-left); N-terminal helix in simulation set V (top-right); C-terminal helix in simulation set H (bottom-left); C-terminal helix in simulation set V (bottom-right). Each point corresponds to an independent replicate simulation performed at a given pH value (the color codes used are described in Fig. 4) and the black line passes through the average value over all the replicated at a given pH. The C-terminal helix tilt angle of the replicates in which this helix unfolded at pH 9 was not calculated (replicates 5 in set H and 1 in set V).Full size imageFigure 8Scatter plots of the helix tilt angles vs average protonated fraction of Asp19 for the simulation set V at pH 7. The plots display the tilt angle as a function of the protonated fraction for the N-terminal (left side) and C-terminal (right side) fusion peptide helices. The average protonated fraction and the average tilt angle (computed as described in Figures S1 and S2) were calculated over the last 400 ns of simulation for each replicate of the simulation set V at pH 7. Each point represents one independent replicate simulation, the black line corresponds to the best linear fit to the points computed with gnuplot, and the r value indicates the statistical correlation.Full size imageTo further test the hypothesis that the peptide tends to deviate from the vertical conformation at high pH, we performed 5 independent standard MD simulations with fixed protonation states, with all the titrable residues deprotonated, starting from the final state of a vertical CpH simulation (a detailed description is available in supporting information). We observed that in 3 out of 5 standard MD simulations (replicates 1, 2 and 4) the peptide adopted a horizontal conformation (Figure S8) and was interacting with only one membrane leaflet. The C-terminal helix (where the charged E11 and D19 residues are located) lied parallel to the membrane plane in the head group region and the N-terminal helix was slightly tilted and more deeply inserted inside the membrane. In replicates 3 and 5 the peptide did not lose all the contacts with the opposite leaflet. , the N- terminal end of the peptide tends to maintain the interaction with the lipid headgroups, and, as it moves from one side of the membrane to the other, it drags these headgroups to the center of the bilayer. This creates what seems to be a metastable state, in which the membrane is deformed with contacts between the two leaflets. We observed that in 2 of the replicates the membrane leaflets detached from one another after a few microseconds of simulation (replicates 1 and 2), whereas in replicates 3 and 5 other replicates, they did not and replicate 4 represents an intermediate state. Replicates 3, 4 and 5 seem to be trapped in a metastable state, in which the membrane is deformed. However, visual inspection of these trajectories indicates that they are heading in the same direction as replicates 1 and 2, although the membrane leaflets did not completely detach. Overall, these observations support the hypothesis that at high pH the fusion peptide tends to deviate from the vertical state and adopt a more horizontal and solvent-exposed conformation, although this is a slow process, with metastable states along the way.Taken together these analysis highlight the importance of pH on the peptide orientation. At low pH, both the horizontal and the vertical conformations are stable and, at this point, we cannot determine which of the two states corresponds to the global minimum, since they are separated by a high barrier and do not interconvert. On the other hand, at high pH, the vertical conformation is less stable and the peptide tends to become less tilted, even when it starts from a vertical state. This can have important functional implications, since it can affect the peptide-membrane interaction profile and effect on the membrane properties. In fact, previous MD simulations have shown that the fusion peptide has a more pronounced effect on the membrane when it adopts a vertical, membrane-spanning conformation14,15,16.Fusion peptide interaction with the membrane: pH affects the interaction with the N-terminusTo investigate how pH affects the peptide interaction with the membrane, we computed the radial distribution functions of each of the residues of interest around the phosphate and ester oxygens (Fig. 9). This analysis shows that in the simulation set H, the peptide frequently interacts with the phosphate oxygens and this interaction is mediated mainly by the N-terminal site. Comparing the radial distribution functions obtained at different pH values, we observe larger peaks at pH 3 and 5, corresponding to acidic pH. We also observe that, in the simulation set H, Trp14 often interacts with the ester oxygens and the N-ter also interacts with the ester oxygens at pH 3. In the simulation set V, the N-terminal group frequently interacts with the ester oxygens, particularly at low pH values. This can be attributed to the fact that the N-terminus is more frequently protonated at low pH (as shown in the titration curves) and also to the higher stability of the vertical membrane-spanning conformation in acidic pH, which enables the N-terminal to penetrate deeper into the membrane. These results highlight the relevance of the N-terminal and Trp14 groups for the interaction of the influenza fusion peptide with the membrane.Figure 9Radial distribution functions of the lipid phosphate and ester oxygens. Each row corresponds to a given residue: N-ter (1st row); Glu11 (2nd row); Asp19 (3rd row); C-ter (4th row). The 1st and 2nd columns correspond the radial distribution functions of the phosphate and ester oxygens in the simulation set H, respectively and the 3rd and 4th columns correspond the radial distribution functions of the phosphate and ester oxygens in the simulation set V, respectively. The trajectories of the last 400 ns of all the replicates performed at a given pH in each simulation set were concatenated and used to calculate the RDF with the GROMACS gmx rdf tool, using a reference atom for each residue: N-ter (main chain N); Glu11 (CG); Trp14 (NE); Asp19 (CD); C-ter (main chain C).Full size imageTo gain further insight into the nature of the interactions between the N-terminal and the Trp-14 residues with the lipids, we calculated the average number of hydrogen bonds between these groups, at each pH value, for both simulation sets (Fig. 10). The results show that the N-terminal and the Trp14 residues form frequent hydrogen bonds with the phosphate and ester groups, displaying different patterns in the two simulation sets. In the simulation set H, the N-terminus tends to form hydrogen bonds with the phosphate groups, which are more frequent at low pH, when this site is more often protonated. In this simulation set, Trp14 frequently interacts with the ester groups, particularly at pH 3.Figure 10Average number of hydrogen bonds between the N-terminus and Trp14 with lipid phosphate and ester groups. The bar plots show the average number of hydrogen bonds per frame for the simulation sets H (left side) and V (right side). The number of hydrogen bonds in each frame of the final 400 ns of each replicate simulation was calculated with the GROMACS tool gmx hbond. The average number of hydrogen bonds per frame was then calculated for each replicate and the average over all the replicates was computed and is displayed in the bar plots. The error bars were calculated using a bootstrap method: for each condition, five new values were resampled with replacement from the original set of five replicates and their mean value was computed, this process was repeated 1000 times and the error was calculated as the standard deviation of these 1000 mean values.Full size imageIn the simulation set V, the peptide has distinct hydrogen bonding patterns at low and high pH. At pH 5 (corresponding to the fusion pH), in which the vertical conformation remains stable, the N-terminal residue forms frequent hydrogen bonds with the ester groups, whereas Trp14 interacts mainly with the phosphate groups. On the other hand, at high pH the pattern is reversed, i.e., the N-terminus tends to form hydrogen bonds with the phosphate groups and Trp14 interacts more frequently with the ester groups (simulation snapshots illustrating the interaction of the N-terminus and Trp14 with the lipid groups are shown in Fig. 11). At pH 7 and 9 the pattern found in the simulation set V is more similar to the pattern found in the simulation set H, due to the fact that, in some replicates, the peptide tends to deviate from the vertical conformation and become more horizontal (Fig. 7).Figure 11Illustration of the interaction between the N-terminal and Trp14 with the lipid phosphate and ester groups. The molecular images were built with PyMOL33 and correspond to the structures obtained after 805 ns in replicate 2 of the simulation set H at pH 5 (left side), after 620 ns in replicate 1 of the simulation set V at pH 5 (middle) and after 864 ns in replicate 5 of the simulation set V at pH 7 (right side). In the simulation set H the peptide interacts predominantly with the phosphate oxygens and Trp14 tends to form hydrogen bonds with the ester groups. In the simulation set V the hydrogen bonding pattern depends on pH: at pH 5 the N-terminus and Trp14 interact predominantly with the ester and phosphate oxygens, respectively, whereas at pH 7 the pattern is reversed. The peptide is represented as in Fig. 3, with the N-terminal and Trp14 residues depicted using sticks with cyan carbons. The lipids interacting with these residues are represented using sticks, with C, N, P and O atoms colored in gray, blue, orange and red, respectively.Full size imageTaken together with the analysis of the residue protonation and the orientation of the peptide in the membrane, our results indicate that pH affects the peptide orientation in the membrane, which in turn affects the pattern of hydrogen bonds with the lipid phosphate and ester groups. At pH 5, the vertical conformation is stable and this allows the N-terminus to penetrate more deeply into the membrane and establish hydrogen bonds with the ester groups, whereas at higher pH this conformation is less stable, which leads to less frequent N-terminus-ester hydrogen bonds.Pinpointing key residues for the fusion peptide activity: the importance of the N-terminal siteAlthough several simulation and experimental studies have tried to elucidate the molecular mechanism by which the influenza fusion peptide promotes fusion, some of the details of this mechanism remain elusive. cpHMD simulations are particularly suited to shed light into this matter, since they allow proton binding/unbinding during the simulation, introducing a high level of realism that cannot be obtained with standard MD simulations. To investigate how the peptide interacts with the membrane and affects its properties, we focused on the simulations performed at pH 5, in which fusion occurs in biological conditions, and where the peptide has been experimentally shown to have a higher lipid mixing ability. As mentioned above, the C-ter residue Ser-24 was used here as a flanking residue and is not part of the actual fusion peptide. Moreover, in our model peptide this residue is free and can protonate/deprotonate, which does not happen in a biological context, since the C-terminal is attached to the rest of HA. Therefore, the results obtained for this residue cannot be directly extrapolated to the situation observed in the fusion context. For that reason, in the plots shown in Fig. 12 display the flanking Ser24 residue in light grey, whereas the residues that belong to the actual fusion peptide are displayed in dark grey.Figure 12Interaction with DMPC oxygen atoms (top row) and lipid tail protrusion (bottom row) per peptide residue, for the set H (left column) and set V (right column) simulations at pH 5. The plots in the top row show the frequency of interaction of each residue with the lipid phosphate and ester oxygens. A minimum distance below or equal to 0.4 nm between a given residue and a lipid oxygen is used as interaction criteria and the interaction frequency was calculated by dividing the number of frames in which the residue is interacting with a lipid by the total number of frames. The plots in the bottom row show the fraction of lipids that are interacting with a given residue among the lipids that undergo lipid tail protrusion. A lipid is considered to be protruding if any of its tail carbons extend at least 0.1 nm in the z direction beyond the phosphate group. The protruding lipid fraction for each residue was calculated by dividing the number of protruding lipids that are interacting with that residue by the total number of protruding lipids in each replicate. The interaction and protrusion values correspond to the average obtained across all replicates and the error bars were calculated using a bootstrap method: for each residue, five new values were resampled with replacement from the original set of five replicates and their mean value was computed, this process was repeated 1000 times and the error was calculated as the standard deviation of these 1000 mean values. The C-terminal residue Ser24 is displayed in light grey to highlight the fact that this residue corresponds to a flanking residue and is not part of the fusion peptide itself.Full size imageThe analysis of the frequency of interaction of each residue with the lipid phosphate and ester oxygens shows that this interaction occurs mainly through the residues located in the terminal and turn regions, with W14 displaying the largest number of contacts among the fusion peptide residues (Fig. 12—top row). The C-ter flanking residue Ser24 also has frequent interactions with the lipid oxygens, particularly in simulation set V. However, we note once again that this residue is not part of the actual fusion peptide and has different properties in this model peptide relative to its biological counterpart, which means that in a biological context the situation may be different.Interestingly, the contact profiles obtained for the simulation sets H and V are similar, showing that the peptide can form similar contacts with the lipid head groups in the two orientations. These contacts occur mainly through hydrophilic groups (carboxyl of E11, hydroxyl of T15 and Y22) and also through the side chain indole of two Trp residues (W14 and W21), as well as through the N-terminal group of G1 and the main chain NH groups of nearby residues (L2, F3 and G4). This interaction pattern is a consequence of structural properties of the influenza fusion peptide, which adopts a helix-turn-helix structure in lipid membranes, with most hydrophilic residues located in the terminals and close to the turn. Several studies have shown that this structure is very stable and that mutations that affect its stability lead to a decrease or loss of activity7. These results prompt us to hypothesize that the influenza fusion peptide (which has a very conserved sequence across viral subtypes) has evolved to adopt a very stable structure in lipid membranes, with an architecture that enables specific interactions with the membrane headgroups.Previous simulation studies indicate that the occurrence of lipid tail protrusion lowers the energy barrier for membrane fusion19. Protrusion occurs when a carbon from a lipid tail projects beyond the corresponding lipid phosphate group19. Simulations of the influenza fusion peptide in the presence of membrane bilayers show that the probability of lipid tail protrusion is higher for the lipids that are in contact with the peptide, which suggests that this may be one of the mechanisms by which this peptide promotes membrane fusion14,18. One relevant question, which has not been yet addressed, is which residues play the most important roles in promoting lipid tail protrusion. To answer this question, we analyzed the fraction of lipids that are interacting with each residue among the protruding lipids (Fig. 12—bottom row).The results show that the highest protruding lipid fraction is observed for lipids that are interacting with the residues located in the N-terminal region, followed by the residues on the C-terminal end of the fusion peptide, both in the horizontal and vertical simulations. The C-terminal flanking residue also contributes significantly to lipid tail protrusion. Nevertheless, this situation may be different in the context of the complete HA2 protein, where the C-terminal is attached to the rest of the protein. Curiously, W14, which has the largest number of contacts with lipid oxygens, and the other turn residues, do not contribute considerably to lipid tail protrusion, especially in the simulation set H. This indicates that W14 is important to stabilize the interactions of the peptide with the lipid membrane (which is in line with previous studies highlighting the role of Trp residues in membrane-interacting peptides13), but not as much to induce lipid tail protrusion.The peptide N-terminal region has the appropriate features to form strong contacts with the lipid oxygens. These interactions are mediated by the G1-Nter (which is nearly always protonated and positively charged at pH 5) and also by the main-chain NH groups of L2, F3 and G4. These residues can form a network of interactions with the lipid oxygens, although we note that these interactions are dynamic and not all of them are usually present at the same time. Additionally, the helical hairpin architecture adopted by the influenza fusion peptide allows the terminal ends of the two helices to work as “tweezers”, locking the oxygens in the middle. A lipid that interacts with and is pulled by these residues tends to become less ordered, which potentiates lipid tail protrusion that has been previously shown to be significantly increased in the presence of the influenza fusion peptide14,18,19 (simulation snapshots illustrating this behavior are shown in Fig. 13). We also observed that the phosphate atoms of the lipids that interact with the N-terminal region tend to become more buried in the membrane (we called this phenomenon lipid head intrusion, according to a previous reference20), which locally decreases the membrane thickness (Figure S9 in Supporting Information). These observations are in line with a recent study using coarse-grained MD simulations combined with the string method, which found that neuronal SNARE fusion proteins lower the barrier for the stalk formation by thinning the membrane57.Figure 13Illustration of lipid tail protrusion events upon interaction with the N-terminal region. The molecular images were built with PyMOL33 and correspond to the structures obtained after 114 ns in replicate 4 of the simulation set H at pH 5 (left side) and after 597 ns in replicate 4 of the simulation set V at pH 5 (right side). The peptide and lipid representation is identical to the one used in Fig. 3.Full size imageDiscussionUsing a combination of spectroscopic methods and constant-pH MD simulations we characterized the effect of pH on the activity and molecular properties of the influenza fusion peptide. The experimental analysis showed that the peptide is mostly helical in both pH values tested (5 and 7.4) and that the peptide’s ability to induce lipid mixing is ~ twofold higher at pH 5 (which mimics the endosome conditions) when compared to pH 7.4. This improved ability in mixing lipids is not accounted for by a membrane higher affinity at pH 5, since the lipid/water partition coefficient is higher at pH 7. The explanation resides on differential intrinsic properties of the peptides at pH 5 and pH 7.4.Constant-pH MD simulations were herein applied for the first time to the study of viral fusion peptides. The high level of detail and realistic treatment of the coupling between structural properties and protonation, inherent to these simulations, allowed us to shed light into the molecular details of the interaction of the fusion peptide with a membrane bilayer at different pH values. These simulations revealed that pH has a strong effect on the peptide behavior. At low pH (3–5), the N-terminus and the side chains of Glu11 and Asp19 are predominantly protonated, which stabilizes the vertical membrane-spanning configuration tested in this work. In this pH range, the peptide also forms frequent interactions with the lipid phosphate and ester oxygens. On the other hand, at higher pH (7–9) the peptide has a lower tendency to maintain the vertical configuration and adopts a more horizontal water-exposed configuration, interacting less frequently with the lipid ester groups. These findings may explain the twofold activity increase observed at pH 5, since it has previously been proposed that the vertical membrane-spanning configuration is relevant for fusion7,14,15,16.We note that the effect of pH on the influenza fusion peptide properties and membrane-interaction is a rather complex one. Our results indicate that the protonation of Asp19 changes considerably between pH 5 and 7, which seems to drive the peptide to adopt different configurations in the membrane: membrane-spanning at low pH and more horizontal and shallow configurations at higher pH. This in turn can alter the interaction of the peptide with the membrane. As an example, the radial distribution function and hydrogen bond analysis show that in the simulation set V the N-terminus interacts more with the ester oxygens at low pH than at high pH. This is due to the fact that, besides being more frequently protonated at low pH (as revealed by the titration curves), in acidic conditions, in which the vertical membrane-spanning conformation is stabilized, the N-terminus can also penetrate deeper into the membrane and interact with the ester groups. Thus, although Asp19 does not have frequent interactions with the lipids, as shown in Figs. 9 and 11, the protonation of this residue affects the insertion of the peptide in the membrane, which in turn affects the peptide-lipid interaction profile.The cpHMD simulations also showed that interactions between the N-terminal region and the lipid oxygens play a very important role in lipid tail protrusion, which has previously been shown to increase in the presence of the influenza fusion peptide and lower the barrier for membrane fusion19. This highlights the importance of the N-terminal region for the peptide’s activity, in line with previous works, which proposed that the N-terminus is crucial for fusion10,15,27, and that mutations in this residue tend to decrease or abolish the peptide’s fusogenicity4. Recently, Worch et al. compared variants of the influenza fusion peptide with free vs acetylated N-terminus, using experimental and computational methods, and observed that a free N-terminus (which tends to be protonated and charged) results in a higher fusogenic activity15. They also observed that the 23-residue long fusion peptide with a free N-terminus adopts a more closed helical hairpin conformation, deeply buried within the membrane with a membrane-spanning orientation and promotes lipid disorder. In contrast, the acetylated counterpart has a more open conformation, locates closer to the surface and has a lower impact on the membrane15. Another recent simulation study has shown that the protonation of the N-terminus leads to a deeper penetration into the membrane and contributes directly to membrane fusion27. The location of the fusion peptide at the N-terminal end of fusion proteins is a common feature found in most class I fusion proteins, which suggests the interaction between the N-terminus and the host membrane may have an important role in promoting fusion in several viruses. Some class II fusion proteins (e.g. Dengue E protein), which have internal fusion peptides, connected to the protein through both ends, contain polar or charged residues in the fusion peptide flanking region, which may play a similar role to the influenza fusion peptide N-terminus by interacting with the lipid headgroups and promoting fusion.In the cpHMD simulations we used a DMPC lipid bilayer, which was chosen as model lipid bilayer. Thus, we opted for a well parameterized lipid to ensure that the simulations are accurate. One important aspect that should be taken into account is whether these findings can be extrapolated to other membrane systems, including the POPC:POPE membrane that was used experimentally. Both the DMPC membrane and the POPC:POPE membrane are composed of phospholipids which contain a phosphate and two ester groups. Additionally, both membranes are also in the liquid crystalline phase at biologically relevant temperatures of this study and they are both composed by zwitterionic lipids. Given that the relevant interactions observed in our simulations are established between the fusion peptide residues (particularly the N-terminal and Trp14) and the lipid phosphate and ester groups, it is most likely that the same type of interactions occur in the POPC/POPE membrane. In fact, in a recent study27, the effect of the influenza fusion peptide on membranes with different compositions was studied using multiscale simulations and no significant differences were observed between pure POPC, POPC:POPE and POPC:DOPE membranes, indicating that the peptide has a similar effect in all these membranes. Interestingly the peptide’s ability to promote fusion of the different membranes was considerably more pronounced when the N-terminal was charged than when it was neutral, which is in agreement with our results. This study clearly indicates that the effect of the peptide on the membrane is not heavily dependent on membrane composition, as long as membranes have similar chemical groups, which can interact with the peptide, particularly with the N-terminal residue. Nevertheless, in the future, it would be interesting to perform cpHMD simulation using different membrane bilayers to test whether there are more subtle differences between different systems.

We conducted a longitudinal survey of swine influenza A viruses (S-IAV) circulating in a pig farm with history of endemic S-IAV infection from 2017 to 2018. The samples were collected from 436 pigs including nasal swab samples (n = 436) and blood samples (n = 436). Our result showed that 18.81% (82/436) were positive for influenza A virus and subsequently 57 S-IAV could be isolated. Then 24 out of 57 S-IAVs were selected for whole genome sequencing and could be subtyped as S-IAV-H1N1 (n = 18) and S-IAV-H3N2 (n = 6). Of 24 S-IAVs, we observed 3 genotypes of S-IAVs including rH1N1 (pdm + 1), rH1N1 (pdm + 2), and rH3N2 (pdm + 2). Since all genotypes of S-IAVs in this study contained internal genes from pdmH1N1-2009, it could be speculated that pdmH1N1-2009 was introduced in a pig farm and then multiple reassorted with endemic S-IAVs to generate diversify S-IAV genotypes. Our study supported and added the evidences that pdmH1N1-2009 and it reassortant have predominately persisted in pig population in Thailand. Thus, monitoring of S-IAVs in pigs, farm workers and veterinarians in pig farms is important and should be routinely conducted.

Swine influenza A virus (S-IAV) subtypes H1N1, H3N2 and H1N2 cause respiratory disease in pigs worldwide. In Thailand, S-IAV-H1N1 and S-IAV-H3N2 were first reported in the 1970s1. S-IAV-H1N2 was reported in pig farms in 20052. In general, there are 3 major lineages of H1 gene; Classical swine lineage (CS; 1A), Eurasian avian-like swine lineage (EA; 1B) and human seasonal (Hu; 1C). The CS (1A) has 6 subclusters; α (1A.1), β (1A.2), γ1 (1A.3.3.3), γ2 (1A.3.2), TR (1A.3.3.1) and pdm09 (1A.3.3.2)3. Alpha subclusters (1A.1) could be further classified to subgroups; 1A1.1, 1A.1.2 and 1A.1.3. In Thailand, previous study reported that genotypes of endemic Thai-S-IAV-H1N1 contained H1 from Classical swine lineage (CS) and seven genes from Eurasian avian-like swine lineage (EA) (designated 7 + 1) or H1 and NS genes from Classical swine lineage and six genes from Eurasian avian-like swine lineage (designated 6 + 2)4,5. For S-IAV-H3N2, there are 2 major lineages of H3 gene; North American lineage and Eurasian swine lineage. The North American lineage can be classified into 4 clades of H3 (clade I, clade II, clade III, clade IV) as well as Human-like swine. The Clade IV of North American S-IAV can be further divided into 6 sub-clusters: A-F. In Thailand, the endemic Thai-S-IAV-H3N2 contained H3 and N2 genes from human-like swine lineage and other internal genes from Eurasian swine lineage (PB1, PB2, PA and M genes) and Classical swine lineage (NP and NS genes)6. For S-IAV-H1N2, endemic Thai-S-IAV-H1N2 contains N2 gene from human-like swine lineage, two segments (HA and NS) from Classical swine lineage and other five internal genes (PB2, PB1, PA, NP and M) from Eurasian swine lineage5.Genetic diversity of swine influenza viruses has been observed especially in Asian countries. It has been reported that all major S-IAVs lineages from different continents (CS-H1, EA-H1, pdm2009-like H1, American TR, human-like H3, European H3N2, Avian-like viruses etc.,) are co-circulating in pigs in Asia including Thailand. Co-circulation of different virus lineages could result in virus reassortment and more genetic diverse of the viruses. After the introduction of pdmH1N1-2009, several studies reported pdmH1N1-2009 infection in pigs7,8. Then endemic Thai-S-IAVs were reassorted with pdmH1N1-2009, which contributing triple reassortment internal genes (TRIG). Reassortant S-IAVs with pdmH1N1-2009 became predominant genotypes of S-IAVs in pigs in Thailand and the region9,10. Persistence of gene especially pdmH1N1-2009 in pigs for decade could contribute the generation of a novel virus with high infectivity and more virulence in pigs or humans. Due to the novel S-IAV reassortant could be found in pig farms, routine genetic monitoring of S-IAVs is important.It has been reported that the transmission of human-origin viruses to pigs could contribute the adaptations or mutations for the fitness of the viruses. For example, adaptive mutations of pdmH1N12009 after infection in pigs, the NP gene of the virus develop D53E mutation correlated to less resistance to the antiviral factor in pigs. While some human-origin viruses contain H289Y substitution to reduce resistance to the antiviral factor and increase viral replication11. Some human-origin viruses maintain or loss glycosylation sites in HA protein due to less antibody selection pressure in pigs12. Thus genetic analysis of the S-IAVs is important to identify the potential adaptations or mutations that might relate to potential zoonotic of the viruses. The objective of this study was to conduct a longitudinal survey of S-IAVs circulating in a pig farm with history of endemic S-IAV infection from 2017 to 2018. Genetic diversity of S-IAVs and evidence of genetic reassortment of S-IAVs in a pig farm was investigated.ResultsSurvey for swine influenza viruses in a pig farmIn this study, we conducted longitudinal sample collection from a pig farm in central province of Thailand from 2017 to 2018. This pig farm had a history of endemic S-IAV infection in the past 5 years. Our result showed that 18.81% (82/436) and 19.95% (87/436) of nasal swab samples were positive and suspected for S-IAVs, respectively. By year, S-IAVs could be detected all year round in 2017 which highest in June 2017 (33.33%). In 2018, S-IAVs could be detected in every month of 2018, except March 2018. Highest percentage of S-IAV positivity was in April 2018 with 40.63% (13/32). The 169 S-IAV positive and suspected samples were subjected to virus isolation by egg inoculation. Our result showed that 57 influenza viruses (13.07%) could be isolated (Supplement Table 1).Diversity of swine influenza viruses in a pig farmTwenty four out of 57 swine influenza viruses were selected for whole genome sequencing. The 24 S-IAVs were selected based on time of sample collection, subtypes of the viruses and virus titer (low Ct-value). To identify subtype of S-IAVs, nucleotide sequences of HA and NA genes were compared with nucleotide sequences in the NCBI database by using BLAST program. Our result showed that 24 S-IAVs could be identified as S-IAV-H1N1 (n = 18) and S-IAV-H3N2 (n = 6) (Table 1). Phylogenetic tree of H1 was constructed by comparing S-IAV-H1N1 (n = 18) to 125 references viruses. Phylogenetic tree of H1 gene showed that all S-IAV-H1N1s in this study were clustered with alpha sublineage (1A.1.2) of the classical swine lineage (Fig. 1A). It is noted that alpha sublineage (1A.1.2) is a common lineage of endemic Thai-S-IAVs. Phylogenetic tree of N1 was constructed by comparing 18 S-IAV-H1N1 to 70 references viruses. N1 of S-IAV-H1N1s in this study was clustered with either Eurasian avian-like swine lineage (n = 6) or pdm09 lineage (n = 12) (Fig. 1B). The Eurasian avian-like swine lineage is a common lineage of N1 of endemic S-IAVs in Thailand. Phylogenetic tree of H3 was constructed by comparing S-IAV-H3N2 (n = 6) to 142 references viruses. Phylogenetic analysis showed that H3 of S-IAV-H3N2 in this study was clustered with North America lineage, sublineage human-like swine (both Ha and Hb), which is previously identified as common lineages of endemic Thai-S-IAV-H3N2 (Fig. 2A). Phylogenetic tree of N2 was constructed by comparing S-IAV-H3N2 (n = 6) to 82 references viruses. The reference of NA2 gene included 2 major lineages; North American lineage and Eurasian swine lineage. The North American lineage contains 2 subclusters: N2-1998 and N2-2002 lineages from human seasonal influenza. Phylogenetic analysis showed that N2 genes of S-IAV-H3N2s were clustered into North American lineage with sublineage human-like swine of endemic Thai S-IAV-H3N2 (Fig. 2B). Phylogenetic trees of the internal genes of the S-IAV-H1N1 and S-IAV-H3N2 were constructed by comparing S-IAV-H1N1 (n = 18) and S-IAV-H3N2 (n = 6) to references viruses. The reference viruses included Classical swine lineage, Eurasian swine lineage, North America triple reassortant lineage, human seasonal lineage and pdm09 lineage. Phylogenetic analysis of each internal genes showed that internal genes of S-IAV-H1N1s (n = 18) and S-IAV-H3N2s (n = 6) were clustered with pdm09 lineage indicating S-IAVs in this study acquired internal genes (backbone) from pdmH1N1-2009 virus (Supplement Figures 1–6).Table 1 Description of Thai S-IAV-H1N1 and S-IAV-H3N2 characterized in this study.Full size tableFigure 1(A) Phylogenetic tree of H1 of S-IAV-H1N1.

Circles indicate S-IAV-H1N1 isolated in this study. The phylogenetic tree was constructed by using the Beast program with Bayesian Markov‐Chain Monte Carlo (BMCMC), with 50,000,000 generations and an average standard deviation of split frequencies < 0.10. Values on branches represent posterior probability and times of most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) among H3-S-IAV.Full size imageGene constellation of the S-IAVs was identified by designated by using the combination of eight lineages or clusters of the virus. Of 24 S-IAVs, we observed 3 genotypes of S-IAVs including (1) rH1N1 (pdm + 1) contained H1 from classical swine lineage (CS) of endemic Thai-S-IAVs and the other 7 genes (NA and internal genes) from pdm09 lineage. (2) rH1N1 (pdm + 2) contained H1 from classical swine lineage (CS) of endemic Thai-S-IAVs, while N1 from Eurasian avian-like swine lineage (EA) of endemic Thai-S-IAVs and the 6 internal genes from pdm09 lineage, and (3) rH3N2 contained HA3 and NA2 genes from human-like swine lineage of endemic Thai-S-IAVs and internal genes from pdm09 lineage (Fig. 3A,B). Our result suggested that internal genes of pdm09 lineage persist and become predominant lineage in endemic Thai-S-IAVs (Figs. 1A and 2A, Supplement Table 2). It should be concerned that persistence of gene especially pdmH1N1-2009 in pigs for long period in the pig farms could contribute the generation of a novel virus with high infectivity and transmissibility in pigs or humans.Figure 3(A) Schematic presentation of genotypes of S-IAV-H1N1 in this study.

For receptor binding sites (HA-190, 225), most S-IAVs contained 190D and 225D suggesting preferential binding to human receptor (2,6 sialic acid receptor)13. Expect one virus (CU21626) contained E190 suggesting the virus prefer to bind avian receptor (2,3 sialic acid receptor)14. Genetic analysis of H1 antigenic sites (Sa, Sb, Ca1, Ca2 and Cb) showed that S-IAVs in this study contain similar amino acids of antigenic sites to endemic Thai-S-IAVs (Table 2). For HA3 genetic analysis, the receptor binding sites (HA3-226 and 228) of S-IAVs in this study and endemic Thai-S-IAVs posed I226 and S228 suggesting preferential binding to human receptor14,15. Genetic analysis of antigenic sites of H3 (A, B, C, D, and E) showed that antigenic sites A (140–146) and B (156–161, 189–199) contained amino acids similar to endemic Thai-S-IAVs (Table 3). For genetic analysis of some internal genes (PB2, M and NS genes), all S-IAVs in this study possessed glutamic acid (E) at position 627 in PB2 (E627), which correlated with less virulence of the viruses. While all S-IAVs contained aspartic acid (D) at position 701 in PB2 (N701D) and position 92 in NS (E92D), which correlated to the more virulence of the viruses15,16,17. For genetic analysis of antiviral resistance in M gene at position 31 of M gene, all S-IAVs in this study possessed amino acid N at position 31 (31N) suggesting the viral resistance to amantadine18. On the other hand, genetic analysis of antiviral resistance (oseltamivir) in NA gene (NA1-119, 275, 293, and 295 and NA2-146, 219, and 272) showed that all S-IAVs in this study are sensitive to oseltamivir (for NA1; E119, H275, R293, N295 and NA2; N146, S219, A272) (data not shown).Table 2 Genetic analysis of the H1 gene of Thai S-IAV-H1N1 in this study.Full size tableTable 3 Genetic analysis of the H3 gene of Thai S-IAV-H3N2 in this study.Full size tableFor serological test of S-IAVs, the serum samples were tested for antibodies against influenza subtypes H3N2, H1N1 and pdmH1N1. Our results showed that serum samples had antibodies against S-IAV-H3N2 (37.23%; 140/436), S-IAV-H1N1 (18.35%; 69/436) and pdmH1N1 viruses (27.13%; 102/436). In detail, the HI titer against S-IAV-H3N2 (endemic Thai-S-IAVs-H3N2) was highest in April 2017 (73.33%) and in September 2018 (51.52%). For S-IAV-H1N1, antibody titer against endemic Thai-S-IAV-H1N1 was highest in November 2017 (16.67%) and in August 2018 (29.03%). For pdmH1N1, HI titer against pH1N1 was highest in November 2017 (50.00%) and in July 2018 (63.33%).DiscussionIn this study, we conducted a longitudinal survey in a pig farm from January 2017 to November 2018. The previous study on S-IAVs in this pig farm in 2015 showed that this pig farm had been infected with S-IAVs and estimated prevalence of S-IAVs was 6.66%5. Comparing to previous study, the S-IAV prevalence in this study was 18.81% (from January 2017 to November 2018), which was higher than previous report in 2015. The possible explanation is that this study was more focusing on target sample collection in piglets and weaning pigs (4–10 week-old), thus higher prevalence of S-IAVs was observed.In this study, two subtypes of S-IAVs (S-IAV-H1N1 and S-IAV-H3N2) were identified. Comparing to the previous study in Thailand during 2000–2014, three subtypes of S-IAVs were identified, but S-IAV-H1N2 could not be identified in this study. Notably, S-IAV-H1N2 has lower prevalence than S-IAV-H1N1 and S-IAV-H3N25,19. Phylogenetic analysis of H1 gene showed that S-IAVs in this study as well as endemic Thai-S-IAVs belonged to the distinct sublineage 1A.1.2 of classical swine (CS)5,9. Based on the MCC phylogenetic tree, the H1 gene of S-IAVs in this study was estimated to have separated from endemic S-IAVs-H1N1 since 2010 (Fig. 1A). While N1 gene of S-IAVs in this study was closely related to either Eurasian avian-like swine lineage (EA) of endemic Thai-S-IAVs or pdm09 lineage of pdmH1N1-2009 virus. This result suggested that pdmH1N1-2009 circulated for a period of time or repeat introduced into this pig farm. Then the pdmH1N1-2009 reassorted with other endemic S-IAVs and contribute N1 gene to novel reassortant influenza viruses. Phylogenetic analysis of H3 and N2 genes showed that H3 and N2 were clustered with human-like swine viruses that introduced in pigs during 1990s and became the predominant subclusters (Ha and Hb) of endemic S-IAV-H3N2 in Thailand20. In this study, HA3 and NA2 genes were still clustered with human-like swine lineage, subclusters Ha (n = 1) and Hb (n = 5) suggesting the fitness combination of surface genes (H3 and N2) from endemic S-IAVs and internal genes from pdmH1N1-200921. The MCC tree of H3 showed that the S-IAVs in this study was diverged from the endemic S-IAVs-H3N2 since 2012–2013.In this study, there were 3 reassortant genotypes of S-IAVs; rH1N1 (pdm + 1), rH1N1 (pdm + 2) and rH3N2 (pdm + 2). In Thailand, at least 7 genotypes have been reported including eH1N1 (6 + 2), eH1N1 (7 + 1), rH1N1 (pdm + 1), rH1N1 (pdm + 2), rH1N2 (pdm + 2), rH3N2 (pdm + 2) and pdmH1N1 (Supplement Table 2)5,9,20. The genotype rH1N1 (pdm + 2) and rH3N2 (pdm + 2), which identified in this study, have been previously reported in Thailand indicating these genotypes are stable and continuous circulating in a pig farm for several years. In contrast, novel genotype rH1N1 (pdm + 1), (H1 from classical swine and other 7 genes from pdmH1N1), has never been reported in Thailand. Our result supported the reassortment or multiple-reassortment between endemic Thai-S-IAVs and pdmH1N1-2009. Reassortment of swine influenza viruses have been observed worldwide such as in China22,23, Europe24 and America25,26,27. Since all genotypes of S-IAVs in this study contain backbone (PB2, PB1, PA, NP, M and NS genes) from pdmH1N1-2009. It could be speculated that the entire pdmH1N1-2009 virus did not persist but the internal genes of pdmH1N1-2009 have became predominant lineage of S-IAVs in Thailand. Thus the predominant of internal genes of pdmH1N1-2009 could stimulate the expand diversity and rapid evolution of S-IAVs in Thailand as well as in the region21.The recent study in China has reported that the predominant reassortant S-IAVs genotype G4 (H1N1 gene from Eurasian Avian-like (HA, NA) and internal genes from pdmH1N1-2009 (PB2, PB1, PA, NP, M) and Triple reassortant internal gene (NS)) showed efficient infectivity and high pathogenicity in experimental animal model. Their findings raise a concern of potential pandemic of the viruses28.Based on genetic analysis, the transmission of human-origin viruses to pigs could contribute the adaptations or mutations for the fitness of the viruses. In this study, HA cleavage site, receptor binding sites and antigenic sites of S-IAVs in this study resemble to human viruses, thus the S-IAVs could possibly infect and/or replicate in mammal host including humans. For example, outbreaks of swine origin-H3N2v from pigs to humans and humans to pigs have been documented29. In this study, antibodies against H1N1, H3N2 and pdmH1N1 were observed in this pig farm. It is noted that pig had antibody against pdmH1N1, even though the pdmH1N1 viruses could not be identified in the pig farm. It has been reported that no cross-reaction between antibodies against H1-S-IAV and H1 pandemic viruses30. Thus, the HI titer result confirmed that pigs in this farm were exposed to both endemic S-IAV-H1 and S-IAV-H3 and pdmH1N1. It should be noted that the HI antibody titer against pdmH1N1 could be either from pandemic HA already circulating in this swine farm or from pandemic HA that has been recently introduced from human. Based on our findings, we can speculate that reverse zoonotic infection from workers to pigs as well as zoonotic infection from pigs to workers in the pig farm could be occurred. Thus, monitoring of influenza virus in pigs and workers is important and should be routinely conducted. The management in pig farm is important for example personal hygiene, personal protective equipment (PPE), seasonal influenza vaccination should be practiced and used in the pig farms for prevention and control of influenza transmission in pigs and humans.Materials and methodsA longitudinal survey of swine influenza viruses in a pig farmIn this study, a longitudinal sample collection was conducted in a pig farm from 2017 to 2018. A pig farm was selected based on a history of S-IAV subtypes H1N1, H1N2 and H3N2 circulated in a pig farm5. The pig farm is located in central province, where considered as high-density pig production area in Thailand. The pig farm is a large-scale pig farm contains approximately 1600 sow and produces 2000 piglets per month with 43 building as farm office, 32 pig housing and 10 worker housing. The farm has open-housing system with moderate biosecurity, which birds and domestic animals can access to pig housing areas. The samples were collected from 436 pigs, including nasal swab samples (n = 436) and blood samples (n = 436) from piglets and nursery pigs (4–10-week-old) with clinical signs of S-IAV infection such as coughing, sneezing and nasal discharge. Samples collection was carried out every 4 months in 2017 and every month in 2018 (Supplement Table 1). The nasal swabs were placed in viral transport media (MEM with 7% BSA, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin and 1 mg/ml trypsin). The blood samples were withdraw from jugular vein and placed in 5 ml tubes. The samples were kept on ice and transported to the laboratory within 24 h. The Chulalongkorn University, Animal Care and Uses Protocol committee approved the animal study (CU-VET IACUC #1831103). All animal study procedures were performed in accordance with CU-VET IACUC guidelines and regulations.Detection and isolation of swine influenza virusViral RNA was extracted from nasal swab samples (n = 436) by using GeneAll GENTi Viral DNA/RNA Extraction Kit (GeneAll; Lisbon, Portugal) on a Genti (GeneAll; Lisbon, Portugal). For influenza A virus detection, one-step Real-time RT-PCR was performed by using SuperScript III Platinum One-Step Quantitative RT-PCR System (Invitrogen; California, USA). The one-step Real-time RT-PCR protocol with M gene specific primers and probes was carried out as previously descripted31. Real-time RT-PCR result was interpreted by cycle threshold (Ct- value) of < 36 as positive, Ct-value of 36–40 as suspected, and Ct-value of > 40 as negative.For S-IAV isolation, the real-time RT-PCR positive (n = 82) and suspected (n = 51) samples were subjected to virus isolation by egg inoculation following WHO recommendation32. For egg inoculation, each 100 ul of nasal swab sample was inoculated into 3 embryonated chicken eggs (9 to 11-day-old). After 72 h incubation at 37 °C, allantoic fluid was collected and tested for hemagglutinating activity by HA test. For HA test interpretation, sample with HA titer of ≥ 4 HA unit per 50 µl was interpret positive. For virus confirmation, RNA samples were tested for influenza virus by using one-step Real-time RT-PCR.Characterization of swine influenza virusFor genetic characterization of S-IAVs, 24 IAVs were subjected to whole genome sequencing by next-generation sequencing (NGS). The criteria of selection of 24 S-IAVs for characterization were based on time of sample collection, subtypes of S-IAVs and high virus titer (low Ct-value). To perform whole genome sequencing, eight segments of S-IAVs were amplified by using one-step RT-PCR with SuperScript III RT-PCR system with Plantinum Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen; California, USA) with MBT12 and MBT13 primers33. Purified PCR products were quantified and submitted to Novogene co. LTD for Illumina Hiseq PE150 (Illumina Corporation, San Diego, California, USA) using NEBNext Multiplex Oligos for Illumina (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, Massachusetts, USA). To validate and determine nucleotide sequences of eight gene segments of influenza A virus, each nucleotide sequence read, 150 bp each (read) was trimmed to remove adaptors. Then nucleotide sequences were assembly using de-novo assembly method by CLC genomics workbench software Version 11.0.1. (QIAGEN; Hilden, Germany). The sequence contigs were compared with sequence database by BLAST. After the references influenza viruses were selected from BLAST results, the trimmed sequences were used for read mapping to references. Finally, the whole genome sequences were extracted to FASTA format (.fas) by CLC genomics workbench software. Nucleotide sequences of 8 gene segments of swine influenza virus were submitted to the GenBank database under accession number # MT377918-MT378109 (Table 1).For phylogenetic analysis, the nucleotide sequences of each gene of S-IAVs from this study were compared with reference S-IAVs. The reference nucleotide sequences of S-IAVs were obtained from Influenza Research Database (https://www.fludb.org). The reference S-IAVs were selected to represent clades/clusters, geographic locations and times of isolation of the viruses. For H1 gene, the reference viruses include the S-IAVs of Classical swine lineage, CS (1A), human seasonal lineage, Hu (1B), Eurasian avian-like swine lineage, EA (1C). The Classical swine lineage (1A) can be further divided into 6 sub-clusters: alpha (1A.1), beta (1A.2), gamma1 (1A.3.3.3), gamma2 (1A.3.2), pdm09 (1A.3.3.2) and North American triple reassortant (TR) lineage lineages3. For HA3 gene, the reference viruses include the S-IAVs of North America lineage and Eurasian swine lineage. The North American lineage contains 4 clades of S-IAVs (Clade I, II, III, IV). The Clade IV of North American S-IAV can be further divided into 6 sub-clusters: A-F. For NA1 gene, the reference viruses include the S-IAVs of Classical swine lineage (CS), human seasonal lineage (Human seasonal), North American triple reassortant (TR) lineage and Eurasian avian-like swine lineage (EA). For NA2 gene, the reference viruses include the S-IAVs of North American and Eurasian swine lineages. The North American lineage can be further divided into 2 sub-groups based on year: 1998 from earlier H3N2 introduction (N2-1998–2012) and 2002 from 2000s human seasonal H1 introduction (N2-2012–2016). For internal genes, the reference viruses include the S-IAVs of Classical swine lineage, human seasonal lineage, North American triple reassortant and Eurasian swine lineage.To construct phylogenetic trees, the nucleotide sequences of each gene of the viruses (both references viruses and viruses form this study) were aligned with Muscle program v3.634 in MEGA v7.0 software35. Phylogenetic analysis of HA and NA gene of S-IAV was performed by using a BEAST 2.0 program applying a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (BMCMC) algorithm. The best-fit substitution model was implemented by bModelTest (Bayesian model test package for BEAST 2). A strict clock model with coalescent constant population was used as model parameters. The Bayesian MCMC chain lengths were 50,000,000 generations, with sampling every 10,000 generations. The tree iteration was discharged with 10% of the chains as a burn-in pattern by using a tree annotator. The resulting MCC tree was drawn with FigTree software (v1.4.2) (Molecular evolution, phylogenetic and epidemiology, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK). Posterior probability and times of most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) among S-IAVs are provided on branches of trees. Phylogenetic analysis of each internal gene of S-IAV was performed by using MEGA v.7.0 (Tempe, AZ, USA) with neighbor-joining method with Kimura 2-parameter with 1000 bootstrap replicates and Beast program with Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (BMCMC) with 50,000,000 generations and an average standard deviation of split frequencies < 0.05. Substitution rates among sites were set in uniform rate and gabs in the sequences were treated in pairwise deletion. To assign genotype of the S-IAVs, lineages or clusters of each gene of the virus were assigned based on the comparison to reference viruses. After lineages or clusters of gene are assigned, the combination of eight lineages or clusters was assigned as genotype or genetic constellation of S-IAVs. The genotypes of the S-IAVs can help to identify reassortment and genetic diversity of the viruses.Serological test for antibodies against swine influenza virusHemagglutination inhibitor test (HI test) was used for detecting antibodies against S-IAVs. In this study, HI test was performed to detect antibodies against 3 reference antigens including endemic S-IAV-H1N1 (A/swine/Thailand/CU-CB1/06), pandemic H1N1-2009 (A/swine/Thailand/CU-RA29/2009) and endemic S-IAV-H3N2 (A/swine/Thailand/CU-CB8.4/2007). In detail, the serum sample was incubated at 56 °C for 30 min to remove heat-labile non-specific factor. Then 100 µl of serum sample was treated to remove non-specific inhibitor. For HI test of S-IAV-H3N2 virus, receptor destroying enzyme (RDE) was used to treat serum (50 µl of serum: 150 µl of RDE) and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h and inactivated at 56 °C for 1 h. The RDE-treated serum was mixed with 100 µl of 50% chicken erythrocyte and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. After centrifuging at 2000 rpm for 10 min, the supernatant was free from non-specific inhibitor serum. For HI test of S-IAV-H1N1 and pdmH1N1-2009, 20% of kaolin was used to treat serum (100 µl of serum: 400 µl of 20% kaolin) and incubated at 25 °C for 30 min. For sedimentation of kaolin, the kaolin-treated serum was centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 min. The serum was added with 100 µl of 50% chicken erythrocyte and incubated at 25 °C for 1 h. After centrifuging at 2000 rpm for 10 min, the supernatant was free from non-specific inhibitor serum. To perform HI test, reference antigens were prepared to 8 HA unit per 50 µl. First 50 µl of treated serum was mixed with 50 µl of PBS in the first well and serially twofold diluted. 50 µl of reference serum was added in each well and incubated at 25 °C for 45 min. 100 µl of 0.5% chicken erythrocyte was added into each well. After incubating at 25 °C for 1 h, the samples with HI titer of ≥ 1:40 were interpreted as positive against specific S-IAVs subtypes.Ethics statementThis study was conducted under the approval of the Institute for Animal Care and Use Protocol of the Chulalongkorn University (CU-VET; IACUC#1831103).

It’s a staggering absence, given that almost 250,000 people died here.Interesting new research gives us an important part of the answer, by examining how those deaths were thought about at the time. Not a lot, is the sobering main takeaway, with a surprising lack of public or political focus on the deaths, even accounting for them coming after the bloodbath of the First World War.In contrast to the war, there was a lack of commemoration of the pandemic’s victims – what the authors call “a silencing of grief”. Given how many memorials and statues we have (the less said about this week’s addition the better), the fact there wasn’t a single public memorial to the influenza pandemic stands out.The researchers argue that our failure to remember left us underprepared for this pandemic. And we do seem to be repeating the mistake, collectively pretending that the disgraceful number of deaths in care homes never happened.How we remember shapes what comes next. There is a hope that the experience of this crisis will prompt major change. Building Back Better is the slogan everyone shares, while agreeing on nothing else. But if the public want to forget the pandemic, they may choose to party afterwards, rather than demand change. After all, the 1920s were called the Roaring Twenties for a reason.

By Kate Mabus November 17, 2020 University of Chicago Photographic Archive Students In Sewing class at the University of Chicago settlement school, May 17, 1918, several months before the flu arrived. Through the past year, the COVID–19 pandemic has drastically reshaped the average American’s way of life and upended the traditional college experience for UChicago students. However unprecedented these times may feel, the city of Chicago reckoned with a similar pandemic almost exactly 100 years ago. The influenza virus strain commonly referred to as the “Spanish flu” reached the United States in 1918, a year after the nation entered World War I. Researchers have no consensus on the origins of the virus. However, it did spread domestically from soldiers returning to the U.S., who brought the virus to military bases, including Naval Station Great Lakes (NSGL), about 40 miles north of downtown Chicago. In September 1918, when the first sailors at NSGL contracted the flu, the station proactively implemented a number of preventative measures. NSGL enacted quarantine controls, though not one strict enough to prevent a wedding ceremony. A number of sanitary measures were also implemented; “50,000 men will be given daily nose and throat sprays. Sneeze screens have been placed in sleeping quarters and other places where the men assemble,” the Chicago Tribune reported on September 15. Ultimately, the station’s commandant, W. A. Moffett, was confident that a day off duty and exposure to fresh air would prevent the disease. However, days later, students from Northwestern’s Student Army Training Corps contracted the virus. As the death toll rose at NSGL and sickness spread through the North Side, Chicago Health Commissioner John Dill Robertson prepared for the nearly inevitable spread through the city by issuing isolation orders for anyone experiencing symptoms. As a respiratory disease, the H1N1 virus of 1918 had a similar mechanism of transmission to COVID–19. Consequently, medical professionals like Robertson advised Chicagoans to reduce crowding and isolate themselves if they were experiencing symptoms. “No matter what particular kind of germ causes the epidemic, it is now believed that influenza is always spread from person to person, the germs being carried with the air along with the very small droplets of mucus expelled by coughing or sneezing, forceful talking, and the like,” Robertson wrote in a health report that was published by various city papers. “If there is cough and sputum or running of the eyes and nose, care should be taken that all such discharges are collected on bits of gauze or rag or paper napkins and burned.” Regardless of this early understanding, Chicago found itself vastly unprepared for the first wave of the influenza epidemic. By September 1918, Cook County Hospital had a shortage of hospital beds with Chicago residents who had contracted the flu and the city was bracing itself for the full scale of the epidemic. By October 9, UChicago had already accumulated 26 flu cases on campus. The Flu at UChicago When The Maroon broke the news of campus closing in March of 2020, students were preparing for finals. In 1918, students were preparing for war. The Maroon’s reporting from 1918 reveals an impatient attitude among a student body already burdened by the war. One article from October 23, reporting on a football practice, treated the virus like a temporary nuisance among much greater stressors. “Several of the men are expecting to be in the next lot of men sent for officers’ camps, and they are not showing very much interest in the game. The ‘flu’ restrictions are also setting to kill interest,” The Maroon reported (“Military Work and ‘Flu’ Kill All Pep in Maroon Practice,” 10/23/1918). In an isolated part of Chicago, University students were sheltered from the extent of the virus until late into the pandemic, which would come to infect a third of the U.S. population. And with European enemies on Americans’ minds, little did they expect that this invisible threat would take more lives than the war itself. According to the same issue of The Maroon, cases at UChicago initially started off much lower compared to other areas of the city. But when numbers rose dramatically at the start of the influenza pandemic, changing the forecasts of severity within days, students and news coverage caught onto the pandemic’s significance. Through October, The Maroon’s headlines changed tone from “No Occasion for Alarm About Influenza Epidemic” (10/9/1918) to “’Ware Influenza!” (10/22/1918). At the beginning of the epidemic, students were dissatisfied with the University’s lack of transparency. Lacking the power of email or a UChicago Forward dashboard, students in 1918 were left in the dark. “Although it seems impossible to get any official statement from University authorities on the campus influenza situation, all evidence points to the fact that the number of fairly serious cases has increased in the last few days to quite a degree,” The Maroon wrote. Once the University gathered itself and settled in to face the epidemic, an emergency office sprung up to meet community needs and care for individuals with the virus. “Women members of the faculty and wives of professors have been rendering aid to neighborhood families. An emergency office has been established in the rooms of the Woman’s War Aid in Lexington Hall,” The Maroon wrote (“University Remarkably Free From Influenza,” 10/23/1918). A temporary hospital was established at 5826 Ingleside Avenue, The Maroon reported (“‘So Called Flu” Is on Decline at University Say Experts in Charge,” 1/23/1920). The University also converted its settlement house, a product of Jane Addams’s urban reform movement, into a staging ground for the epidemic. The settlement house also provided emergency hospital space and served about 3,000 meals a day from their kitchen, the exact number UChicago Dining offered to South Side community members this March. Without any medical or pharmaceutical interventions, people in 1918 relied on sanitary measures to prevent the flu, many of the same ones used today. “Lectures have been given, bulletins posted, ‘flu’ masks distributed and all that. However, to have any kind of success students must watch carefully. Sneezing and coughing send out germs; poorly ventilated rooms increase and re-distribute germs,” The Maroon reported in October. As the main avenue for prevention, limiting of social gathering was stressed as a social responsibility, using much of the same rhetoric seen today. With messaging striking similar to editorials published in The Maroon this year, an October 1918 bulletin to the University penned by a Dr. Reed reads, “Any person who sneezes or coughs without putting a handkerchief completely over the nose or mouth is a menace to the health of others.” Social Distancing Social distancing guidelines, or “limitations to gatherings” as they were referred to in 1918, were implemented early on as one of the only proven ways to prevent the spread. However, closures were slow and inconsistent across gathering spots, and convenience often took precedence over safety. Occupation with the war caused civilians to ignore many of the warning signs and safety guidelines of the pandemic. Robertson hesitated to implement gathering restrictions early and moved slowly when he did, not wanting to disrupt war efforts or bring further burden to Americans already consumed with the war. Finally, in mid-October, the Illinois Influenza Advisory Commission passed binding resolutions banning public gatherings including social events and dances, banquets and dinners, lectures, funerals, and athletic events. However, churches, streetcars, and even restaurants and theaters were allowed to remain open as long as they maintained adequate ventilation. At the very beginning of the 1918 pandemic, Robertson allowed a Liberty Loan parade to continue despite the risk of infection, whereas in 2020 the city cancelled the annual St. Patrick’s Day parade at the onset of COVID–19. Like 2020, 1918 was also an election year for the midterms. However, by Election Day 1918, cases were declining in Chicago and the public’s inclination to social distance was lower, leading to little effect on voting. While federal and state governments manage the pandemic today, in 1918 this control was in the hands of local municipalities. “The pandemic wasn’t a political football the way it is today. President [Woodrow] Wilson never publicly addressed it, and the federal government was not expected to play a significant role in individuals’ healthcare matters,” a 2020 Time magazine article said. Schools also remained open. Unlike today, when classes can be conducted online, in-person schooling was the only way for students to receive a consistent education. However, unlike the risks many schools have had to grapple with when reopening this fall, in the 20th century public schools were broadly used as a way to monitor children’s health and so were already equipped with thorough systems of medical inspection. At UChicago, in timeless fashion, students were more worried about falling behind on schoolwork than potentially contracting the flu. One issue of The Maroon reported, “Under the present regime it is difficult to miss classes and keep up with the work, but any student feeling at all unwell should stay away from gatherings of any sort.” Although social distancing measures were not as strict as they are today, students were just as eager and even more insistent to return to normal activities. Athletics and dances were two areas where student reporters continually expressed their desire to resume and were outspoken in their attempts to convince others. “There is hope that the Purdue game will be played next Saturday, as there are indications that the Chicago health department is considering lifting the ban on public gatherings,” The Maroon wrote in an article from October 25 (“Continued Rain Sends Football Men Indoors for Blackboard Drill”). “The likelihood of contracting the ‘flu’ at a game is not so great as in the cases of indoor meetings.” Oftentimes, The Maroon’s coverage reflected that campus attitudes treated social distancing more as a momentary disturbance or even a nuisance to normal social life than a necessary measure. In one issue of The Maroon, the “Society Notes” (10/9/1918) section reported casually, “Autumn rushing is having a lapse while Phyllis and her young sister are quarantined with the ‘flu.’” Frustration can be seen in various Maroon columns and opinion pieces. After all, there was no Zoom or social media to keep in touch in 1918; socializing came to a halt and students were eager to circumvent restrictions. One such column called The Campus Whistle (1/23/1920) reads, “The famous class of 1920 is next to give a party…. Wouldn’t it be funny if they postponed Settlement night on account of the flu? The answer is no.” Reopening Students longed for liberation from the gathering restrictions and met any loosening of social distancing guidelines with great excitement. In November 1918, a period when cases were down, one student went so far as to write a poem (11/1/1918) on their joy: “The flu has flown,/ Now isn’t that nice./ Again we can go/ To the Edelweiss.” The decline of the virus coincided with the end of the war and young soldiers returning to their schooling, a period that The Maroon titled in one January 1919 article as the “reconstruction of campus traditions” (“Begin Reconstruction of Campus Traditions,” 1/16/1919). Students quickly resumed their social lives. The aforementioned article reported, a bit facetiously, that social groups on campus “are getting back into their ante-bellum tea-dancing habits.” Apparently, two laudable doctors who managed the pandemic were repurposed “to work the stretcher for any tea hounds who may succumb after stepping it all afternoon and night.” However, anxiety still remained among some; the coverage noted that the Reynolds Club president was still deciding whether or not to host a receiving line for fear of transmission. For roughly a year after the pandemic proper, flu cases continued to pop up in surges. Today, experts warn Chicago is in the midst of a second wave of coronavirus as cases surge across the country. As with the influenza pandemic, we are likely in for a two-year-long haul of the coronavirus. In the meantime, we can all look forward to the day when we can return to the Edelweiss.

By: Aaron Cantrell Posted and last updated NASHVILLE, Tenn. (WTVF) — Tennesseans are urged to get their flu vaccine as soon as possible, in an effort to prevent the "twindemic" of both COVID-19 and influenza.Thursday, the Tennessee Department of Health kicks off its "Fight Flu TN" vaccination effort. All 95 Tennessee counties will have sites where people can get a free flu shot. There will be 107 sites and many of them will offer drive-thru options.In Nashville, there are four different sites offering the shot:Lentz Public Health CenterWoodbine Public Health CenterEast Public Health CenterMurfreesboro Road COVID-19 Assessment CenterHealth officials say if Tennesseans get vaccinated it can help them stay healthy and help our hospitals not become overwhelmed."If you reduce the incidents of flu you’re going open to up our healthcare facilities to be able to handle the sick individuals they serve every day," said Paul Peterson, the Director of the Tennessee Department of Health's Emergency Preparedness Program.The department of health says the flu vaccine reduces the chance of hospitalization or death from flu by 40 to 60 percent.“We know the flu kills," Peterson said. "We know that it may not kill you but if you get the flu and share that someone who has an immune system that is compromised, elderly, or they may be younger than 6 months and can’t get vaccinated. You’re opening risks up to others.”Health officials are encouraging everyone ages six months and older to get a flu shot. They’re especially encouraging the elderly and pregnant women to get one.However, high dose flu shots will not be available at the state vaccine sites. People who require one will need to get one at a pharmacy or doctor's office.To find the closest vaccination site to you, click here. Copyright 2020 Scripps Media, Inc. All rights reserved.

(Ben Garver/The Berkshire Eagle/The Associated Press)Social SharingNova Scotia health officials are asking flu shot providers in the province to stop using a particular vaccine lot connected to adverse effects in three adults in New Brunswick.They received the vaccine between Oct. 2 and Oct. 20 and experienced events that were "neurological in nature," according to a news release from New Brunswick Public Health on Saturday.The source of the health complications remains under investigation and it has not been determined if the vaccine was the cause.Symptoms appeared within a week of receiving the Flulaval Tetra vaccine from lot number KX9F7, a Glaxo SmithKline product.As a result, public health officials in New Brunswick withdrew the remaining doses from the batch.Nova Scotia is now following suit. As a precaution, providers in the province are being advised to stop using the specific lot number until further notice, according to a news release from the Department of Health and Wellness on Monday.The province initially received 120,000 doses of this specific lot in September before distributing it to providers, the release said.Public Health is still strongly encouraging all Nova Scotians to get their annual flu shot, adding that it remains a safe and effective way to protect yourself from the flu.There have been no reports of adverse events related to this lot number in Nova Scotia, or in any other province in Canada.Health Canada is conducting a full review of the situation.MORE TOP STORIES2 new COVID-19 cases identified in Nova ScotiaHalifax narrowing the search for partners to spend federal housing moneyBullying, toxic work climate alleged at Indigenous Services health branch on East Coast2020 not the year to delay sending Christmas parcels, says Canada PostSocialist victory in Bolivia a huge relief to former Halifax residentCBC's Journalistic Standards and Practices|About CBC NewsCorrections and clarifications|Submit a news tip|Report errorFooter LinksMy AccountProfileCBC GemNewslettersAbout CBC AccountsConnect with CBCFacebookXYouTubeInstagramMobileRSSPodcastsContact CBCSubmit FeedbackHelp CentreAudience Relations, CBC P.O.

View all partners Email X (Twitter) Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger The federal government has concluded a $1 billion agreement, funded over 12 years, with Seqirus to secure supply from a new high-tech manufacturing facility in Melbourne which would produce pandemic influenza vaccines as well as antivenoms. This would boost Australia’s sovereignty when the country was faced with a future pandemic, and make for quick responses. Seqirus, a subsidiary of CSL Ltd, will invest $800 million in the facility, which will be built at Tullamarine, near Melbourne airport. It will replace Seqirus’ facility in the inner Melbourne suburb of Parkville which is more than 60 years old. The Victorian government has supported the procurement of the land for the new operation. Seqirus says the complex will be the only cell-based influenza vaccine manufacturing facility in the southern hemisphere, producing seasonal and pandemic flu vaccines, Seqirus’ proprietary adjuvant MF59 ®, Australian antivenoms and Q-Fever vaccine. Work on construction will begin next year; the project will provide some 520 construction jobs. The facility is due to be fully operating by 2026, with the contract for supply of its products running to 2036. The present agreement between the federal government and Seqirus is due to end in 2024-25. Seqirus is presently the only company making influenza and Q fever vaccine in Australia, and the only one in the world making life-saving antivenom products against 11 poisonous Australian creatures, including snakes, marine creatures and spiders. Scott Morrison said that “while we are rightly focused on both the health and economic challenges of COVID-19, we must also guard against future threats. "This agreement cements Australia’s long-term sovereign medical capabilities, giving us the ability to develop vaccines when we need them. "Just as major defence equipment must be ordered well in advance, this is an investment in our national health security against future pandemics,” he said. Stressing the importance of domestic production capability, the government says when there is a global pandemic, countries with onshore capabilities have priority access to vaccines. Health minister Greg Hunt said: “This new facility will guarantee Australian health security against pandemic influenza for the next two decades”. Seqirus General Manager Stephen Marlow said: “While the facility is located in Australia, it will have a truly global role. Demand for flu vaccines continues to grow each year, in recognition of the importance of influenza vaccination programs. This investment will boost our capacity to ensure as many people as possible – right across the world – can access flu vaccines in the future.” To deal with the present pandemic, the government has earlier announced $3.2 billion to secure access to over 134.8 million doses of potential COVID-19 vaccine candidates developed by the University of Oxford-Astra Zeneca and the University of Queensland, Pfizer-BioNTech and Novavax.

Cobb, M.D., M.P.H., from the University of Washington in Seattle, and colleagues examined the risk for mortality by comparing critically ill patients with COVID-19 and those with seasonal influenza in a retrospective study.A total of 65 critically ill patients with COVID-19 and 74 with influenza were included. The researchers found that COVID-19 patients were more likely to be male, have higher body mass index, and have elevated rates of chronic kidney disease and diabetes. Thirty-seven and 10 percent of COVID-19 and influenza patients, respectively, identified as Hispanic. The proportion of patients with fever and lymphopenia on hospital presentation was similar between the groups (about 40 and about 80 percent, respectively). The groups also had similar rates of acute kidney injury and shock requiring vasopressors. Patients with COVID-19 had slower improvements in oxygenation, longer durations of mechanical ventilation, and lower rates of extubation compared with those with influenza, although the need for invasive mechanical ventilation was similar between the groups. Hospital mortality was 40 and 19 percent in COVID-19 and influenza patients, respectively (adjusted relative risk, 2.13)."Our findings underscore the importance of efforts for limiting transmission as well as ongoing investigations for effective therapies and vaccines," Cobb said in a statement.Abstract/Full TextCoronavirusJournalFluMortalityIntensive CareRelated StoriesNo stories found. © healthday-en 2024Powered by Quintype www.healthday.com INSTALL APPHow mRNA vaccines work, and how they might protect us from the flu and other diseases - ABC NewsSkip to main contentABC NewsJust InFor YouPoliticsUS ElectionWorldBusinessAnalysisSportLifestyleEntertainmentMoreSearch the news, stories & peopleLog inNews HomeJust InFor YouAnalysisRuralWatch LiveHealthIndigenousPoliticsUS ElectionScienceElectionsWorldEnvironmentInvestigationsBusinessFact CheckLocal newsSportAFLNRLFootballTennisCricketNetballLifestyleWellbeingRelationships & FamilyFood & RecipesPersonal FinanceHome & GardenEntertainmentTV & MoviesBooksMusicPop CultureArtsYour ABC AccountPersonalise the news andstay in the knowLog in to personaliseFacebookYouTubeInstagramTwitterEmergencyBackstoryNewsletters中文新闻BERITA BAHASA INDONESIATOK PISINABCABC iViewABC ListenTriple JABC KidsABC NewsABC News News HomeScienceLatest updatesAsk a questionShare How mRNA vaccines work, and how they might protect us from the flu and other diseasesBy science reporter Belinda SmithABC ScienceTopic:Science and TechnologySat 21 Nov 2020Saturday 21 November 2020Sat 21 Nov 2020 at 8:00pmDisplay captionTwo mRNA vaccines are frontrunners in the race for a COVID-19 vaccine.

They don't contain antigens. Instead, they contain a blueprint for the antigen in the form of genetic material — that's the mRNA.Coronavirus questions answeredPhoto shows An illustration of a cell on an orange background with the word 'coronacast' overlayed.Breaking down the latest news and research to understand how the world is living through an epidemic, this is the ABC's Coronacast podcast.In the case of Pfizer and Moderna's vaccines, both of which are two-dose vaccines, the mRNA provides the plans to build the spike protein that the SARS-CoV-2 virus uses to latch onto and infect our cells.When injected into muscle, the mRNA is taken into cells, which 'read' the mRNA and build antigens over the course of a few days, after which time the mRNA is broken down.The cells push the antigens outside their membrane and wave them around, a bit like a flag, alerting the immune system that something foreign has managed breach the body's defences.In response, a type of white blood cell called B cells make and pump out antibodies — Y-shaped molecules that form an immune 'memory' of that particular antigen. (Fun fact: the word 'antigen' comes from 'antibody generator'.)Antibodies can circulate in our blood stream for a long time, although we aren't sure how long SARS-CoV-2 antibodies last.Should an antibody encounter a virus bearing its matching antigen, it latches on, stopping the virus from worming its way into a cell, and signals to the immune system that an invader has been detected.We develop Y-shaped molecules called antibodies against all kinds of pathogens, and while some stick around for years, others disappear within months. (Getty Images: CHRISTOPH BURGSTEDT/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY)Yet antibodies aren't the whole story. The other arm of what's known as our adaptive immune system hinges on T cells — a type of white blood cell.One T cell subset, known as memory T cells, helps B cells manufacture antibodies with more accurate antigen-recognition sites, which hones the immune response.A second subset of T cells, called cytotoxic or killer T cells, seeks and destroys cells in our body that have been infected by a pathogen.Some of these killer T cells retain a 'memory' of their foe and hang around in the body for a long time, ready to mobilise and strike again if needed.Interim results from Pfizer and Moderna suggest their mRNA vaccines certainly tick the antibody box, said Magdalena Plebanski, a professor of immunology at RMIT University."But these mRNA vaccines, from what I've read in their press releases, do not seem to be as powerful at inducing cytotoxic T cells," she said.Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemicThat said, T cell function is harder to measure than antibody levels — plus different laboratories have their own ways of doing it — so it's hard to compare vaccines that way.And less T cell action isn't necessarily bad news, Professor Plebanski added.mRNA vaccines' strength in generating antibodies means they may prevent pathogens from hijacking our cells in the first place, such as malaria, which invades and reproduces in red blood cells.Indeed, mRNA vaccines have been in early phase studies to protect against viral infections such as Zika and rabies, according to Sanjaya Senanayake, an infectious diseases specialist at the Australian National University.Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemicCould mRNA vaccines help control flu?mRNA vaccines could also potentially control seasonal influenza, which struck 310,000 Australians last year, Dr Senanayake said.Influenza strains that infect humans and spread around the world each year have two main types of spike protein on their surface: haemogglutinin and neuraminidase, or H and N respectively.Each influenza strain is named for its H and N subtypes. For instance, H1N1 was responsible for the 1918 pandemic and is still one of the main flu infections circulating today.But the same Hs and Ns aren't in circulation each flu season. They mutate and change year to year. So infectious disease experts make an educated guess about which H and N antigens the next flu vaccine should include.From deciding on H and N subtypes to final product, the seasonal flu vaccine process takes around six months.A CSL scientist in 2009 during swine flu vaccine development. (Supplied: CSL)The beauty of mRNA vaccines is the speed at which they can be designed and made.Once you know the mRNA sequence for your antigen of interest, it's relatively quick and straightforward to synthesise that genetic material in the lab — and certainly much faster than producing the amount of antigen needed for flu jabs every year.And Moderna, at least, is already on it.In May 2019, the company reported Phase 1 clinical trial results for mRNA vaccines against two influenza strains with pandemic potential: H10N8 and H7N9, both of which were first found in humans in China in 2013.Clinical trial stagesPre-clinical: Testing in animals. Does the vaccine produce antibodies? Does it protect against illness? What dose is necessary?Phase 1: Testing in a small number of humans. This phase is about making sure the vaccine is safe.Phase 2: More testing in humans — does the vaccine actually work?Phase 3: Testing in a larger number of humans to confirm its effectiveness.Phase 4: After the vaccine has been rolled out, ongoing surveillance to make sure it's safe and doesn't have long-term adverse effects.Terry Nolan, an epidemiologist at the Doherty Institute, was at the conference in Slovenia last year where Moderna presented its results."They had much better antibody responses than any of the other conventional approaches to influenza vaccines," Professor Nolan said.And while it's true that Moderna has not yet produced a human vaccine all the way to FDA approval, "it already had human trials for influenza for these two candidates, which both looked spectacularly good".The seasonal flu vaccine is really a combination of four: two against influenza A strains, which can be transmitted between humans and animals, and two influenza B strains, which infect humans only.A mRNA vaccine could package them all up into one."It would be theoretically possible to have those four components as different types of mRNA in a single vaccine," Professor Nolan said."That would be much easier to make than the current egg-based or cell-based vaccines which are used for flu."Scientists have long been working towards developing a universal flu vaccine — that is, one that protects against all strains of the virus, no matter their H or N status.That would involve making mRNA that codes for a chunk of the virus that's identical across all strains, and does not mutate easily, Dr Senanayake said."So I think if a mRNA vaccine is being looked at for flu, it's probably best to see if they can target those areas, then whatever technology you use, you're more likely to get a longer lasting flu vaccine, because it won't matter if the Hs and Ns change."Can mRNA vaccines help us be ready for the next pandemic?Alongside diseases like the flu that have been around for more than a century, our immune system must grapple with new and emerging infections.A 2007 World Health Organization report warned that infectious diseases are emerging at "the historically unprecedented rate of one per year".SARS, Zika, Ebola and avian and swine flu — not to mention COVID-19 — are just a few recent examples.For most vaccines against emerging diseases, the challenge is not vaccine effectiveness.Instead, it's about speed: developing and manufacturing a vaccine and getting it to the people who need it as quickly as possible.That's why once the infrastructure is in place, mRNA vaccines are potentially a good weapon to have on hand, said Larisa Labzin, an immunologist at the University of Queensland."I think the biggest advantage of the mRNA vaccines is really against these emerging pathogens, the ones that we don't know much about," Dr Labzin said."As long as we essentially have the mRNA sequence, we could theoretically deliver anything. That makes it very practical for making vaccines."A previous emerging infection — MERS — gave scientists a bit of a leg-up when it came to making mRNA vaccines for COVID-19."A lot of people have been studying the spike protein of the MERS coronavirus, which is structurally similar (to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein)," Dr Labzin said."Then they could get the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein very, very quickly, and that meant they knew which kind of modifications to make to the (mRNA) sequence of the spike protein."Even though Pfizer and Moderna — and others — could make quick leaps forward based on existing work, none of it would be possible without basic research, she added."Those small tweaks that we can make by studying the structure of RNA and how stable it is at different temperatures, and how we introduce this material into cells — they all make a huge difference."All those things can be attributed to scientists working on what seemed like an obscure problem in a lab, but then has incredible benefits."What you need to know about coronavirus:The symptomsThe number of cases in AustraliaTracking Australia's vaccine rolloutGlobal cases, deaths and testing ratesAsk us your coronavirus questionsPosted Sat 21 Nov 2020 at 8:00pmSaturday 21 Nov 2020 at 8:00pmSat 21 Nov 2020 at 8:00pm, updated Sat 21 Nov 2020 at 11:11pmSaturday 21 Nov 2020 at 11:11pmSat 21 Nov 2020 at 11:11pmShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Top StoriesDonald Trump calls Vladimir Putin and urges him not to escalate Ukraine war, media reportsTopic:World PoliticsPhoto shows Close up of Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in conversation Dutton is already testing Trump's campaign slogans.
