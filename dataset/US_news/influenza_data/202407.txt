Cambodia reported four human infections with highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) (bird flu) virus that were identified in late January and early February 2024. These were the first human infections with HPAI A(H5N1) virus identified in Cambodia in 2024. CDC Update February 12, 2024 — Cambodia has reported four recent human infections with highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) (bird flu) virus. These are the first human infections with HPAI A(H5N1) virus identified in Cambodia in 2024. The four infections occurred in three children, one of whom died, and an adult, all of which were identified in late January and early February. All patients reportedly had a history of recent exposure to sick or dead poultry prior to their illness. Currently, there is no indication of person-to-person spread associated with these four cases of H5N1 virus infection in Cambodia, and they are not thought to pose a threat to the health of the U.S. public. The first two patients were epidemiologically unrelated and were admitted to different hospitals in Cambodia; they both recovered and were discharged home. The third patient died shortly after transfer to a pediatric hospital in the capital, and the fourth patient was admitted for monitoring and treatment. The third and fourth patients are siblings but lived in different villages; dead poultry were brought from the household of the fourth patient to the household of the third patient, and both siblings were exposed. Investigations are ongoing to monitor their close contacts and to identify any additional infections. The U.S. CDC is working closely with the Ministry of Health's Cambodia Communicable Disease Control (C-CDC) Department, the National Institute of Public Health in Cambodia (NIPH), the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Institut Pasteur du Cambodge (IPC), the World Health Organization, the United States Agency for International Development, the Food and Agriculture Organization, and the Wildlife Conservation Society of Cambodia in a One Health approach to respond to these sporadic human infections. Genetic sequencing of the first and third patients' specimens by IPC and NIPH identified both H5N1 viruses as H5 clade 2.3.2.1c, which has circulated in Cambodia among birds and poultry for many years. This H5 virus clade 2.3.2.1c in Cambodia is different from the H5N1 virus that has caused wild bird and poultry outbreaks in the United States (clade 2.3.4.4b) and other countries. Genetic sequencing of the fourth patient's specimens is in process. Six sporadic human infections with HPAI A(H5N1) bird flu virus occurred in Cambodia last year (February, October, and November 2023). Additional sporadic human infections are not unexpected in people with direct or close unprotected exposures to sick or dead poultry infected with HPAI A(H5N1) virus in areas with endemic spread among poultry. Four of the six human infections with HPAI A(H5N1) viruses in Cambodia during 2023 were fatal.

Despite the large reports of cases in Asia, Europe, and North America, little is known about its circulation in South America. Here, we describe the isolation, and whole genome characterization of HPAIV obtained from sampling 26 wild bird species in Peru, representing one of the largest studies in our region following the latest HPAIV introduction in South America. Out of 147 samples analyzed, 22 were positive for detection of avian influenza virus using a qRT-PCR-based assay. Following inoculation into embryonated chicken eggs, fourteen viral isolates were obtained from which nine isolates were selected for genome characterization, based on their host relevance. Our results identified the presence of HPAIV H5N1 subtype in a highly diverse wild bird species. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that these isolates correspond to the clade 2.3.4.4b, sharing a common ancestor with North American isolates and forming a monophyletic group along with isolates from Chile. Altogether, changes at the amino acid levels compared to their closest relatives indicates the virus is evolving locally, highlighting the need for constant genomic surveillance. This data evidence the chances for spillover events increases as the virus spreads into large populations of immunologically naïve avian species and adding conditions for cross species transmission.

The underlying mechanisms for evolution in Influenza viruses rely on both viral genetics and their animal hosts factors. In terms of viral genetics, its genome comprises of single-stranded, eight negative-sense viral RNAs segments1. Viral genome encodes for eleven proteins including some accessory proteins2. These eight segments are named and presented from the largest to shortest, as follows: PB2, PB1, PA, hemagglutinin (HA), nucleoprotein (NP), neuraminidase (NA), matrix (M), non-structural (NS)3,4. These proteins have different functions during the viral replication process. Thus, viral genome segmentation is the basis for reassortments, and recombination as evolutionary mechanisms commonly found in influenza viruses. Furthermore, influenza viruses are known to infect a wide host range5,6 which is the basis for spillover events and viral adaptation to novel species1. Altogether, influenza viruses are of the most rapidly evolving pathogens of major concern for animal and public health7.Hemagglutinin (HA) and Neuraminidase (NA) are important viral proteins playing fundamental roles in viral replication8,9 and are used for Influenza virus classification. HA is a relevant protein for viral entry into target cells, therefore it is the main target for neutralizing antibodies and vaccine development. On the other hand, NA is a tetrameric protein with enzymatic activity that allow viral release from infected cells following replication10. In addition to their relevance in viral replication, these proteins are used for viral classification purposes. Hence, there are sixteen (16) HA and nine (9) NA described to date, in wild birds belonging to the Anseriformes and Charadriiformes orders11,12,13. In addition, there is a description of two HA and NA subtypes of influenza-like viruses found in bats from Peru14,15.Furthermore, avian influenza is classified into low and highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses based on the HA cleavage site and the clinical severity of infections in chickens16. Thus, most avian influenza viruses harboured by wild birds correspond to low pathogenicity avian influenza viruses (LPAIVs) causing asymptomatic or mild infections in poultry4. On the other hand, some H5 and H7 lineages are known to produce a severe infection leading to massive death when domestic birds are infected and, specially H5 subtypes, causing death in their wild bird hosts. Thus, the co-circulation of Low- and High-pathogenicity AIVs in wild bird species is a contributing factor for the emergence of novel Influenza viruses with distinctive features.Highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs) have caught the attention from scientists due to its concern in animal and public health17. Since the emergence of the HPAIV H5N1 GS/Gd lineage in China in 1996, the virus has evolved into ten clades and multiple subclades18. More recently, one of these genetic clades, such as the 2.3.4.4b clade, represents the main influenza virus type causing the current outbreak around the world18,19,20,21. Despite this virus characterization in multiple geographical areas, little is known about the circulation of the HPAIV H5N1 in South America.Since 2006, we have implemented a local system for monitoring avian influenza viruses in wild birds in Peru. This has led to the detection, isolation, and characterization of multiple AIV isolates that corresponded to those LPAIVs22,23,24. Nevertheless, the detection of HPAIV H5 was reported on November 14th in 2022, following an outbreak of high mortality in pelicans of Paita, Piura (North coast of Peru) by the national authorities. Since the arrival of this HPAIV, more than 55,000 wild birds have died due to these HPAIV H5 infections and 46 outbreaks in poultry farms have been controlled. More recently, spillover events from avian into marine wildlife have been reported by the National Service of Natural Protected areas (SERNANP). Thus, our objective was the identification, isolation, and whole genome characterization of this HPAIV detected in Peru, in wild birds from Peru. Our study represents the first complete genetic description of this virus in South America in a large group of local wild bird species.ResultsAvian influenza virus is detected in a large group of wild bird species with clinical presentation of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAIV) infectionSamples analysed were obtained from oropharyngeal, cloacal and fecal swabs from animals as part of our active surveillance for influenza viruses or those showing clinical sings of HPAIV infection in a collaboration with SERFOR (Servicio Nacional Forestal y de Fauna Silvestre). In total, we evaluated 147 samples that corresponded to 26 wild bird species ranging from migratory birds, waterfowl and some local birds that are part of the natural ecosystem in the pacific coast of Peru. A large proportion of the samples analyzed corresponded to Franklin’s gulls (Leucophaeus pipixcan), Peruvian pelicans (Pelecanus thagus), Sanderlings (Calidris alba), American oystercatchers (Haematopus palliates), mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) among others. A list of the species and number of samples evaluated is presented in Table 1. Following sample collection, PCR showed that 22 out of 147 samples (14.9%) resulted positive for avian influenza. Cts values of these samples ranged from 12 to 30 cycles out of the 45 PCR cycles protocol. Positive samples were processed for inoculation into embryonated chicken eggs for viral isolation.Table 1 Sample distribution among wild bird species evaluated for HPAIV infection.Full size tableAvian influenza virus was successfully isolated in embryonated eggs from wild bird speciesEmbryonated chicken eggs have shown to be the ideal support for avian influenza virus isolation25. Here, we inoculated the 22 qPCR-positive samples in eggs selected previously. Out of those inoculated, 14 samples had evidence of viral replication through embryo death and hemagglutination assay. These samples were obtained from Peruvian pelican (3/6), Belcher’s gull (3/4), Harris’s hawk (1/3), American kestrel (1/2), Guanay cormorant (1/1), Humboldt penguin (1/1), Franklin’s gull (1/2), Peregrine falcon (1/1), Peruvian booby (1/1) and Western barn owl (1/1). We did not obtain the viral isolate from the Chesnut-eared aracari sample that was positive by PCR. These findings were detected in a single round of inoculation. A summary of the results is presented in Table 2. Following isolation, positive samples were selected based on the frequency of wild bird species reported by the National authorities and their migratory capacity, for whole genome characterization.Table 2 Positive samples isolated and genome sequenced in the current study.Full size tableHighly pathogenic Avian influenza virus H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b was identified and characterized in wild birdsGenetic analysis allows the subtyping of influenza viruses based on the types of HA and NA proteins. Moreover, HA amino acid sequences show differential patterns of cleavage sites to differentiate highly and low pathogenic AIVs26. Here, we selected 09 isolates for subtyping and genomic reconstruction. Genetic analysis at the nucleotide and amino acid levels identified that our isolates corresponded to the H5N1 subtypes. Furthermore, cleavage sites at the HA regions identified sequences corresponding to those highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses. Hence, we found the multi basic motif (PLREKRRKR↓GLF) in all highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses. A geographical map showing the sample origin distribution is shown in Fig. 1. Furthermore, we took advantage of a Bayesian model to estimate the most recent common ancestor and define the phylogenetic relationship of the H5N1 viruses identified here compared with those described in America, Asia and Europe. Based on H5 phylogenetic reconstruction, our results showed that our isolates corresponded to highly pathogenic avian influenza clade 2.3.4.4b, sharing a common ancestor with isolates obtained from snow goose in North Dakota and Kansas, in the US, 2022. Furthermore, tree topology suggested that this virus is forming a monophyletic group along with those isolated from Chile, within the 2.3.4.4b clade, and appears to accumulate changes in this protein. Phylogenetic trees of the HA and NA proteins are shown in Fig. 2 and 3.Figure 1Geographical map of avian influenza isolates and species harbouring HPAIV H5N1 avian influenza virus clade 2.3.4.4b. Red dots represents the locations where isolates were obtained in Lima and La Libertad, two major cities in the coastal area in Perú (A). Pictures identifying the wild bird species source of the isolates characterized in our study are presented (B). (Geographical map was designed and prepared by Geog. José More-Bayona as requested).Full size imageFigure 2Phylogenetic analysis of H5 gene shows the virus circulating in Peru corresponds to the clade 2.3.4.4b. We collected 588 H5 complete sequences from GenBank encompassing those from Asia, Europe, and America. A phylogenetic analysis was performed using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm in Mr. Bayes. A general time reverse (GTR) substitution model with gamma distribution was used. Our Peruvian sequences (red asterisks) grouped together with those isolates from Chile (blue) forming a monophyletic group with a common ancestor in the US.Full size imageFigure 3Phylogenetic analysis of N1 gene from the Peruvian isolates has a common ancestor in the US. We collected 567 N1 complete sequences from Genbank encompassing those from Asia, Europe and America. A phylogenetic analysis was performed using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm in Mr. Bayes. A general time reverse (GTR) substitution model with gamma distribution was used. Our Peruvian sequences (red asterisks) grouped together with those isolates from Chile (blue) forming a monophyletic groups with a common ancestor in the US.Full size imageGenetic analysis of HA shows unique changes in the HA of HPAIV H5N1 from wild birds in PeruFollowing phylogenetic reconstruction, we evaluated whether the HPAIV circulating in Peru is presenting some relevant changes compared to those members of the 2.3.4.4b. Hence, we identified some changes that were absent in those observed in most isolates from the US, while others were present in those closely related to our Peruvian isolates. Genetic distances in HA ranged from 99.08 to 99.5% in the samples sequenced. A summary of the genetic distances among all the genome segments with their closest relatives is presented in Table 3. Amino acid changes were identified in 7 out of 8 viral segments, in all nine isolates compared to their most recent ancestor. These changes suggest that our isolates along with those closely related from Chile share a common ancestor with a North American isolate, while depicting a subclade within the 2.3.4.4b phylogroup. Further studies are required to assess whether these changes are relevant for HA function or vaccine evasion. Amino acid changes observed in all nine isolates are presented in Table 4.Table 3 Genetic diversity of HPAIV H5N1 compared to their closest relatives described.Full size tableTable 4 Amino acid changes detected in the H5N1 influenza A viruses isolated in Peru compared to the reference genome.Full size tableDiscussionAnseriformes and Charadriiformes are considered the natural reservoirs for avian influenza viruses, while migratory birds are responsible for viral spread in large geographical areas, playing a significant role in the emergence of novel viral forms. Currently, the emergence of HPAIV H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b affecting multiple species of wild and domestic birds has been described in Asia, Europe, and America, becoming of major concern for animal and public health. Despite this, little is known about the viral circulation and genetic characterization in South America.In Peru, the national service for animal health (SENASA) reported the first detection of a HPAIV infection in November 2022. This case was reported in a coastal city of the Northern Peru, following the occurrence of Peruvian pelicans found death in the Paita beach in Piura. Our initial findings suggested that a viral infection was responsible for causing severe disease in the animals evaluated. Our results allowed the identification of avian influenza viruses with a highly variable viral load based on the Ct values observed. Although Ct values can be used as approximation method to assess the viral load for other viral infections27, we did not find evidence of correlation in terms of severity and viral levels based on Ct values (data not shown). Thus, clinical presentation and the PCR results indicate that influenza virus was likely responsible for the severe cases. Further genetic characterization was required to establish the presence of a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus.Genomic sequencing and genotyping of these viruses detected the presence of HPAIV H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b, affecting a broad range of species. We speculate that these species play a differential role into the viral spread since some of them appeared to be more affected than others. Moreover, movement dynamics of these species might add contributing factors in viral dissemination into local areas. Despite differences in the host source, our isolates showed a high degree of genetic conservation. Our isolates belonging to a monophyletic group share a common ancestor with isolates from Chile. However, some genetic changes have been detected compared to those isolates. Hence, genetic surveillance needs to be reinforced in the upcoming months to closely track the viral evolution in our region. Evolutionary analysis shows that these viruses have been transmitted to the US from Europe and Asia and are co-circulating with other viral lineages in the Americas. It is well known, the H5N1 viruses circulating are reassortants of viruses with different origins28 and these events might continue in South America.Avian influenza viruses in Peru have been tracked in wild birds since 2006 when we established a viral surveillance program that allowed the detection and characterization of only LPAIVs prior to the current outbreak. Thus, we identified that these LPAI viruses arose from common ancestors of viruses isolated in North America during the 2019 and 2022 period22. These findings indicate that migratory routes of wild birds play a major role into the viral entry in the South American region and are the potential route for those highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses as these birds arrive to this region in the summer period in the south hemisphere6,29. As expected, our current results confirmed this since these HPAIVs shared a common ancestor with those in the US.Furthermore, although this current outbreak represents the first introduction of the HPAIV clade 2.3.4.4b virus in the Peruvian ecosystem, we speculate that multiple introductions might occur in the upcoming migration periods. Further studies are required to define other multiple introductions of the virus and whether there are alternative routes of viral entry30. These conditions are the fundamental basis for the emergence of viruses with novel characteristics that might infect other species including mammals. Although no human-to-human transmission has been reported, national authorities have reported the occurrence of infections in marine mammals in Peru. Even though this is not under the scope of this paper, we emphasize that genetic surveillance of these spillover events must be monitored closely since the viral adaptation to these species might reveal the capacity for infection in humans and the human-to-human transmission.Peru is one of the most biodiverse countries around the world. Thus, the entry and spread of HPAIVs, such as H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b, into immunologically naïve wildlife populations is rapidly diminishing the local species, with major impact in those in an endangered situation. Our study shows that multiple local avian species are affected by this virus, and some of those studied here especially Peruvian pelicans (Pelecanus thagus), and Guanay cormorants (Phalacrocorax bougainvillii) and others have been placed into an even more endangered condition. We call the authorities to pay close attention to these species of ecosystem importance. In addition, to its intrinsic importance for the local ecosystem, they do play a major economic role. The guano produced by these species is commercialized as a natural fertilizer of great value. Thus, we urge the national and regional authorities to take actions in a coordinated manner to avoid the impact on these species.In summary, our study represents the first report of isolation and genome characterization of HPAIV H5N1clade 2.3.4.4b from the largest wild bird species pool affected of severe disease in South America. Furthermore, this report shows evidence that despite the close genetic relationship of our isolates with North American strains, there are some nucleotide and amino acid changes detected in the virus circulating in Peru, indicating the potential for spillover events into other species.Materials and methodsSamplesOne hundred and forty-seven samples encompassing oropharyngeal, cloacal, and fecal swabs were collected and submitted to the Laboratory of Avian Pathology at the Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos in Peru, between November 2022 and January 2023. These samples included those taken as part of our active surveillance of avian influenza in Peru, along with those obtained as a research collaboration with the Servicio Nacional Forestal y de Fauna Silvestre (SERFOR). All samples were taken in a universal transport media (VTM) tube and transported to the lab during the same collection day at 4 °C and processed immediately. In brief, all swabs were resuspended in 500 µl PBS with antibiotics, filtered through 0.22-micron syringe filters to remove bacterial contamination and centrifuged for clarification (8000×g for 10 min). Supernatants were saved for further molecular test by a specific PCR-based assay for detection of Influenza A viruses and isolation into embryonated chicken eggs. In some instances, samples were pooled into 4–5 samples according to geographical location, species, date, etc. Some live birds samples obtained from the National Forest and wildlife Service (SERFOR), presented neurological and respiratory clinical signs suggestive of influenza infections. A summary of the samples submitted is presented in Table 1 and video recordings of representative species affected by the infection is presented in the supplementary information (Sup S8 and S9). Protocols and methods were carried out in accordance and approved by the Ethics and animal welfare committee (CEBA) by the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine in the Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos (CEBA202133). We confirm that the current study adheres to the ARRIVE guidelines31.Viral detectionOne hundred and forty (140) µL of samples processed were used for RNA extraction. For this purpose, we used the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, US), according to manufacturer’s instructions. For viral gene detection, we used the RealPCR Influenza A RNA mix for avian influenza A virus detection following the manufacturer’s instructions (IDEXX, US). The protocol, based on 45 amplification cycles, allow the identification of avian Influenza A viruses. The positive status was used as a primary criteria of sample selection for further isolation and sequencing procedures.Viral isolationViral isolation was performed by inoculation of 0.2 mL of samples into the allantoid cavity of 9–11-days-old embryonated chicken eggs in five replicates25. Following inoculation, eggs were incubated at 37.5 °C for 4 days and checked daily to assess embryo survival. A round of inoculation was performed to increase the viral load for improving the metagenomic sequencing of all eight genomic segments. Following inoculation, an hemagglutination test was used as screening method to evaluate the presence of an hemagglutinating agent. In brief, allantoid fluid (25 uL) was serially diluted with two-fold volume of PBS (pH 7,4). This mix was incubated into an equal proportion of 1% chicken red blood cells (RBCs). After 20 min, the bottom formation or red blood cells agglutination was recorded. Following clarification (20,000×g for 10 min), positive samples were selected based on wild bird species host and viral load for genome sequencing.Next generation sequencingPositive samples for PCR against Influenza A virus and hemagglutination test following inoculation into embryonated eggs, were selected for genomic characterization using a metagenomic approach. First-strand cDNA was performed using the SuperScript™ III First-Strand Synthesis kit (Invitrogen™, US) with the FR20RV primer (5′-GCCGGAGCTCTGCAGATATC-3′) prior to library preparation. Library preparation was performed using Nextera XT method and sequenced on a MiSeq platform using paired 150 base read chemistry (Cambridge Technologies, Worthington, MN, USA).Genome assembly and annotationRaw data (fastq files) was evaluated based on Phred score using FastQC v. 0.11.9 software32, while adapters were removed using Trimmomatic version 0.3233. The genome was assembled using SPAdes Genome Assembler version 3.13.134 and annotated using Prokka genome annotation version 1.14.635, along with the use of the Bacterial and Viral Bioinformatics Research Center, version 3.28.2236. Gene annotation was performed using the tools of the Influenza virus genome database to address all eight genome segments. Where low coverage detected the sequences were deposited as partial CD and submitted to Genbank under the accession numbers: OQ747758-OQ747763 (HA), OQ747765-OQ747770 (NA), OQ747863-OQ747868 (PB2), OQ747878-OQ747883 (PB1), OQ747873-OQ747877 (PA), OQ747895-OQ747899 (MP), OQ747884-OQ747888 (NS), OQ747889-OQ747894 (NP).Avian Influenza subtyping and phylogenetic analysisFollowing genome assembly, we focused on the HA and NA subtyping. For this purpose, we collected the coding region of HA and NA genes from AIV viruses submitted to the National Center for bioinformatics information (NCBI), Influenza virus genome database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/FLU/Databaseph-select.cgi?go=genomeset). We only included in the analysis the coding complete sequences submitted from 2017 to 2023, isolates from avian species in Asia, Europe and America. The alignment was performed in MEGA X37, with posterior manual editing and files were saved as nexus files and used for phylogenetic reconstruction. We used the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm in Mr. Bayes to estimate a Bayesian inference for phylogenetic reconstruction38. A general time reverse (GTR) substitution model with gamma distribution was used. Markov Chain Monte Carlo chains were run for 2 million iterations and sampled every 100 steps to allow all parameters converge with effective sample size values greater than 200, and with a burn-in of 0.25 to discard the 25% of samples at the beginning of the analysis. The consensus tree was summarized and further visualized using Figtree39. For the other six genome segments, sequences were retrieved from the NCBI database and selecting sequences collected from 2017 to date, for phylogenetic reconstruction, including sequences from America, Asia and Europe. A schematic representation of our methodology for detection, isolation and genome characterization is presented in Fig. 4.Figure 4Schematic representation of the general procedure for isolation and genome characterization of HPAIV H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b. National authorities reported the outbreak of avian influenza virus during mid November 2022. Following this report, we performed a viral surveillance along a research collaboration with SERFOR to identify the virus involved in the current outbreak. Viral isolation and detection of avian influenza virus started on December 2022 and the genome characterization was performed with those positives for the hemagglutination and qRT-PCR assays. Currently, we are continuing with the surveillance program for analysis of the HPAIV evolution in Peru.Full size image Data availability Nucleotide sequences produced in the current study have been submitted to GenBank.

The harsh environment is full of everyday heartbreak: predation, starvation, chicks that are lost at sea when their icy shoreline melts away. Now a novel pathogen threatens to rip through colonies of marine mammals and birds, potentially including penguins. If the very worst happens, it could make ghosts of entire species—and scientists can’t do much more than wait.A deadly strain of H5N1 avian influenza has been blazing through poultry farms and flocks of wild birds around the world, infecting mammals and even killing at least one polar bear. Now it’s knocking at the gates of Antarctica, just as dozens of species that have likely never experienced any strain of avian influenza are congregating to raise their next generation. Avian influenza is currently causing big outbreaks on islands around the southern tip of South America, about 1,000 miles from the Antarctic Peninsula. The virus has led to clusters of illness in Gentoo Penguins on the Falkland Islands in January and in fur seals, elephant seals and other animals on the island of South Georgia last December. Scientists fear it will just require a short jump for the virus to hit the Antarctic Peninsula and spread into the rest of the continent.On supporting science journalismIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing.

We’ve been like that since basically the end of [last] year,” says Marcela Uhart, a wildlife veterinarian at the University of California, Davis, who is currently monitoring the outbreak from Patagonia. “It is unlikely that [avian influenza] will not get there just because of how connected the species are,” with the animals often traveling long distances through the Southern Ocean to find food.Avian influenzas come in two varieties. Typically, wild birds catch mild cases of what scientists call “low-pathogenicity” flu, whereas farmed poultry species such as chickens and ducks can develop much more serious infections with “high-pathogenicity” strains. These different flavors can mix, creating more infectious viruses such as the one currently ravaging South America. That combination, a substrain called clade 2.3.4.4b that developed within the past decade, comes from a lineage identified in China in the mid-1990s that has led to occasional outbreaks around the world. But clade 2.3.4.4b has now become a Frankenstein virus that combines the severe disease of poultry strains with a particular affinity for infecting wild birds. In addition to hitting South America, the virus has devastated seabird colonies in Europe, followed migratory birds south into Africa and jumped the Atlantic Ocean to infect even the regal California Condor.“Avian influenza is nothing new; it’s been around for a very, very long time,” says Christian Walzer, a wildlife veterinarian and executive director of health at the global conservation organization Wildlife Conservation Society. But this avian influenza is different. “What’s important to understand is that the whole dynamics have changed,” he says. Credit: Education Images/Getty Images Despite the rapid spread of this strain, scientists aren’t sure how it is transmitted between animals, particularly how it spreads between birds and mammals. Many infected species are scavengers, suggesting that consumption of infected corpses could contribute to transmission; healthy animals may also pick up the virus from the feces of infected ones, researchers say. Some species seem to be resistant to sickness, although they could still be contributing to transmission. “The big problem we have is: we don’t really understand how some birds are able to be infected with this virus and not get sick, but it’s clear that that does happen,” says Ashley Banyard, a virologist at the U.K.’s Animal and Plant Health Agency.By late 2022 and into 2023, the brutal clade 2.3.4.4b virus in South America had killed at least about 600,000 birds and 50,000 mammals—and likely many more, scientists say. “We’ve never had anything of this magnitude in the Southern Hemisphere,” Uhart says.Antarctica and Australia are currently the only continents this avian influenza has yet to reach—as far as scientists can tell. For Antarctica in particular, the virus may simply be spreading undetected. “There is no way to know for sure,” says Michelle Wille, a viral ecologist at the University of Melbourne in Australia, who focuses on avian viruses. “One of the great challenges is that it could already be there, in a place where few people visit.”Detecting any wildlife infection in a remote location is difficult work, but that’s particularly true when most victims are ocean-based species. “It’s really hard to detect anything at sea,” says Amandine Gamble, an ecologist at Cornell University. “It’s probably a huge underestimate of the actual number of fatalities.”Scientists are worried that if the virus takes hold in Antarctica, casualties on the continent could be particularly high. “Highly pathogenic avian influenza has never been recorded there before,” says Thijs Kuiken, a pathologist at the Erasmus University Medical Center in the Netherlands. “The majority of the 48 species of birds and 26 species of marine mammals present in Antarctica are likely susceptible to infection and disease from this virus.”Not only are these animals immunologically vulnerable, but they also have lifestyles that put them at additional risk of infection. “You have these massive, densely packed together bird colonies and some of those megacharismatic, highly threatened species, which are all packed together down there,” such as penguins, Walzer says. “If [the virus] does hit, the impacts will be potentially really devastating.”“Entire populations may disappear,” Wille says of a potential Antarctic outbreak. “This would be a catastrophe.”It could be a catastrophe for species beyond those directly affected—and even beyond those that call Antarctica home, Uhart says. For instance, if there are mass die-offs on the continent, and these corpses become encased in ice rather than sink into the ocean, the deaths could potentially affect the global carbon cycle and nutrient flow. “I don’t think anybody can even imagine what the loss of potentially this huge biomass of wildlife would mean for the ocean,” Uhart says. “I don’t think we understand what this means.”Timing could influence just how bad an Antarctic avian influenza outbreak could be, experts say. Currently, the continent is at the peak of its summer, with many species still busy raising their young—whose fresh immune system could be more susceptible to avian influenza or more likely to spread it, scientists say. “Now is a critical stage,” Gamble says.“If it actually reaches now, it can be very, very fast to spread,” she says. “If we manage to not have the virus reaching the Antarctic continent for a few more weeks, we might be safe for this year.” Most species will disperse out of tightly packed colonies until the next breeding season, making them less likely to encounter other animals—and therefore the virus. Still, Gamble and others worry that would likely be only a temporary stay, given how aggressively the virus is circulating globally. Antarctica may dodge the crisis this year, only to suffer during the next Southern Hemisphere spring and summer.As with so many ecological disasters, the story of avian influenza highlights the consequences of human disruption of the natural world, scientists say. Modern poultry farming, where birds are packed even more tightly than the most crowded penguin colony, fosters the spread of disease. And although several avian influenza vaccines exist, countries around the world have typically opted to instead kill any farm’s entire population after exposure. Tens of millions of chickens have died or been culled in the U.S. alone since 2022. That decision has been driven by fears that vaccinated chickens would interfere with international trade because tests can’t distinguish between infected and vaccinated birds. Nations that don’t vaccinate won’t import poultry with a positive avian flu test.And now, Uhart says, it’s sea lions and elephant seals, cormorants and pelicans and, yes, even penguins that are suffering from this vicious virus. “These poor animals are dying without a voice,” she says. “Unless we tell their story, it could very well go untold.”Rights & PermissionsMeghan Bartels is a science journalist based in New York City.

Leveraging decades of experience and grounded in the long-established GISRS network, e-GISRS will monitor and respond to any epidemic and pandemic threats posed not only by influenza viruses but by other respiratory viruses too. This natural expansion of the scope of GISRS started in 2015 when respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was first included in the GISRS platform. This process was then greatly accelerated in 2020 following the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and the COVID-19 pandemic.As the world advances towards 100 years of collaboration in fighting the deadly menace of respiratory disease outbreaks, e-GISRS will provide an even stronger global foundation for the vital surveillance, preparedness and response efforts needed to protect the world from constantly evolving respiratory viruses.Drawing on lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic, the above meeting was informed by two previous WHO global consultations: https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-WHE-GIH-GIP-2021.1https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240050228The primary meeting objectives were:To consider how best to adapt integrated surveillance practices for influenza and other priority respiratory viruses (that is, novel viruses or known viruses with epidemic or pandemic potential). To identify and discuss gaps and needs when expanding activities beyond influenza, including the envisaged functions and objectives of e-GISRS and its coordination with other surveillance systems and networks.In order to achieve the meeting objectives, two technical workstreams had been initiated prior to the meeting to review evidence and existing guidance, and to discuss the laboratory and epidemiological standards needed for effective influenza, RSV and SARS-CoV-2 surveillance. A third workstream had also been implemented to address issues surrounding coordination gaps and needs of e-GISRS for the surveillance of non-influenza respiratory viruses.During group and panel discussions, integrated surveillance practices were reviewed, and inputs sought on how best to operationalize the standards and address the needs identified by the workstreams. In addition, the crucial role of international cooperation in strengthening global surveillance and response capabilities against all respiratory viruses was highlighted, along with the need to ensure collaborative approaches to emerging health challenges. A number of immediate next steps were also identified, including the revision of current WHO guidance on integrated surveillance.This pivotal meeting reaffirmed the spirit of collaboration and trust which has been the hallmark of GISRS for over 70 years, while also bringing into sharper focus the strengthened, expanded and shared vision for advancing GISRS.CAPTION: Opening Session CREDIT: Abu Dhabi Public Health Center Feature stories Celebrating 70 years of the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System 15 March 2022 Faces of the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) 15 December 2023 Faces of the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) 28 July 2022 Events WHO Meeting on Advancing GISRS 11 – 13 December 2023 WHO Consultation on the Composition of Influenza Virus Vaccines for Use in the 2024-2025 Northern Hemisphere Influenza Season 19 – 22 February 2024 WHO Information Meeting on the Composition of Influenza Virus Vaccines for Use in the 2024-2025 Northern Hemisphere Influenza Season 23 February 2024 09:00 – 12:00 CET More Global Influenza ProgrammeGlobal Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) Regions Africa Americas Eastern Mediterranean Europe South-East Asia Western Pacific Policies Cybersecurity Ethics Information disclosure Permissions and licensing Preventing sexual exploitation Terms of use About us Careers Frequently asked questions Library Newsletters Procurement Publications Contact us Report misconduct Privacy policy © 2024 WHOInfluenza and pneumonia death rate Canada 2000-2022 | StatistaSkip to main contentStatista LogoStatista Logostatista.comstatista.esstatista.destatista.fr Prices & Access Business Solutions Academia and Government Statistics All IndustriesConsumer Goods & FMCGE-CommerceEconomy & PoliticsEnergy & EnvironmentInternetTechnology & TelecommunicationsTransportation & LogisticsTravel, Tourism & HospitalityMost viewed StatisticsRecent StatisticsPopular StatisticsMost used social networks 2024, by number of usersBig Mac index worldwide 2024Global retail e-commerce sales 2014-2027Car brand market share worldwide 2023Quarterly Netflix subscribers count worldwide 2013-2024TopicsMore TopicsE-commerce worldwide -

Read more Death rate for influenza and pneumonia in Canada 2000-2022 Published by John Elflein, Feb 15, 2024 In 2022, there were 15.4 deaths from influenza and pneumonia in Canada per 100,000 population. Influenza, more commonly known as the flu, is a highly contagious viral infection and frequent cause of pneumonia. Pneumonia is a more serious infection of the lungs and is particularly deadly among young children, the elderly, and those with certain chronic conditions. Vaccination There exist vaccines for both influenza and pneumonia, and although effectiveness varies, vaccination remains one of the best ways to prevent these illnesses. Nevertheless, only around 34 percent of Canadians received an influenza vaccination in the past year in 2022. The most common reason why Canadian adults received the influenza vaccination was to prevent infection or because they did not want to get sick. Pneumonia hospitalization Every year tens of thousand of people in Canada are hospitalized for pneumonia. In 2021-2022, there were over 63,000 emergency room visits for pneumonia in Canada, a substantial decrease from the numbers recorded from 2010 to 2020. Perhaps unsurprisingly, those aged 65 years and older account for the highest number of emergency room visits for pneumonia. The median length of stay for emergency department visits for pneumonia in Canada has increased in recent years, with the median length of stay around 330 minutes in 2021-2022.

Chaphalkar, PhD.Reviewed by Sophia CoveneyFeb 11 2024 In a recent study published in the journal PLOS Pathogens, researchers from the United States of America (US) investigated the resistance profile of 4’-fluorouridine (4’-FlU) against an avian influenza pandemic A/CA/07/2009 (H1N1, short for hemagglutinin 1 neuraminidase 1) (CA09). Study: Influenza A virus resistance to 4’-fluorouridine coincides with viral attenuation in vitro and in vivo. Image Credit: joshimerbin/Shutterstock.com They found that the molecule could overcome resistance in six identified escape lineages of the virus in vitro and showed promising results in mice and ferret models. Background Seasonal influenza viruses significantly impact public health and the economy. Every year, around one billion people worldwide get infected with the virus, and millions require hospitalization and advanced medical care. In interpandemic years, more than 600,000 people die from the disease. When zoonotic influenza viruses spill over into the human population, they can cause large-scale pandemics with even higher case fatalities. Existing influenza vaccines offer moderate protection, but efficacy diminishes in vulnerable populations and during poorly matched or pandemic virus strains. Food and Drugs Administration (FDA)-approved antivirals, including adamantes, neuraminidase inhibitors, and baloxavir marboxil, face challenges with low genetic barriers to viral resistance. Several antiviral resistance challenges persist, including adamantes' widespread M2 S31N mutation, neuraminidase inhibitors' rapid emergence of resistance, baloxavir marboxil's swift treatment-emergent resistance, and uncertainties surrounding favipiravir's clinical impact, despite a high resistance barrier. In previous studies, 4’-FlU, a broad-spectrum nucleoside analog, was found to be effective against various ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses, including beta-coronaviruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and avian influenza viruses, and displayed broad-spectrum activity and a wide therapeutic time window. In the present study, researchers explored the therapeutic potential of 4’-FlU via resistance profiling and assessment of the pathogenesis and fitness of resistant recombinants in vitro and in vivo. About the study The study involved the gradual adaptation of recombinant virus CA09 (recCA09) to 4’-FlU through dose-escalation serial passaging in vitro in six independent lineages. Progeny virus titers were determined at each passage, and whole genome sequencing was conducted on 4’-FlU-experienced virus populations and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-treated control populations to identify allele-dominant mutations in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Related StoriesUS study uncovers antiviral resistance in swine-origin influenza, urging enhanced pandemic surveillanceUnraveling the mechanism of Shufeng Jiedu Capsules in influenza treatmentElevated antibody responses to Epstein-Barr virus linked to increased risk of multiple sclerosisThe mutations were localized using structural models. The process aimed to assess the development of resistance and understand the genetic changes associated with tolerance to 4’-FlU. Dose-response assays were conducted against recCA09 to determine inhibitory concentrations (EC50 and EC90) of 4’-FIU. To assess the resistance profile of 4'-FlU against influenza viruses, in vitro and in vivo models, including cells, mice, and ferrets, were employed. In addition, in silico modeling was used for mechanistic characterization. The virus was intranasally inoculated. The viral load was periodically monitored in nasal lavages (of ferrets) and respiratory tissues of mice and ferrets, extracted 4 or 8 days after infection. Statistical analysis involved the use of Student's t-test and analysis of variance (ANOVA) to compare parameters between the groups. Results and discussion The EC50 and EC90 of 4’-FIU were found to be 0.14 and 0.24 μM respectively. During the in vitro adaptation of the virus to 4’-FlU six independent escape lineages with distinct mutations in the recCA09 background were generated. A 2–25-fold increase was observed in EC99 concentrations of 4’-FlU against the different lineages, confirming moderate resistance. No combinations of mutations conferring moderate resistance to 4’-FlU were found in available complete influenza A virus (IAV) genome sequences. The mutations' low individual frequency validated 4’-FIU’s efficacy against circulating human and avian IAVs. The researchers could identify specific residues crucial for shaping the central cavity of the RdRP as key determinants in moderately reducing polymerase susceptibility to 4’-FlU inhibition. Additionally, they suggest that a substantial genetic barrier may hinder the emergence of more robust resistance. Escape was found to arise from individual, additive or synergistic mutations. All the variants showed impaired fitness and attenuation in cell culture and mice models. Although the resistant variants remained pathogenic in the mice, their moderate resistance to 4’-FlU could be overcome pharmacologically in vivo. Oral administration of 4’-FlU at either the lowest (2 mg/kg) or elevated (10 mg/kg) dose was found to effectively overcome resistance, as indicated by the survival of the mice. The positive effect of 4’-FIU was also evidenced by reduced clinical signs and lower tissue virus burden. Even for variants with the most robust resistance or residual pathogenicity, their transmission is compromised and/or easily controlled by the standard dose of 4’-FlU. In the ferret model, the 4’-FlU-treated variants (representing four adaptation lineages) showed impaired invasion of the lower respiratory tract, rendering them either transmission-incompetent or blocking their spread to untreated sentinels. The study's limitations include uncertainty about whether the observed 4’-FlU resistance profile, determined in various experimental systems, equally applies to the human host. Conclusion In conclusion, the present study elucidates mechanisms diminishing the susceptibility of the IAV polymerase complex to 4’-FIU. In mice and ferret models, it is shown that while escape from 4’-FlU is possible, it is associated with viral attenuation and diminished transmission competence. Thus, 4’-FlU-resistant virus populations are found incapable of attaining clinical significance or enduring in circulation in real-world scenarios, highlighting the compound's sustained therapeutic potential. In the future, studies exploring the potential human application and dose levels of 4’-FIU could be conducted. Journal reference: Lieber CM, et al. (2024).

Most human cases have involved direct contact with infected poultry, but there have been concerns that the virus could evolve to spread more easily between people.The WHO and the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization this month warned that Lunar New Year festivities celebrated in much of Asia posed an increased risk of spreading the virus. In a statement, Cambodia’s Health Ministry said the 16-year old brother tested positive for the virus on Sunday but exhibited no symptoms. The boy was undergoing medical treatment, and officials are investigating who had contact with the brothers and how and where they contracted the virus.The Health Ministry said the boy who died last week fell ill with fever, shortness of breath, coughing and fainting after eating a meal his parents had cooked from chicken and ducks they raised.

Here, we show that an epitope on the stem domain of H5 hemagglutinin is highly conserved and that the human monoclonal antibody CR9114, targeting that epitope, potently neutralizes all pseudotyped H5 viruses tested, even in the rare case of substitutions in its epitope. Further, intranasal administration of CR9114 fully protects mice against A(H5N1) infection at low dosages, irrespective of pre-existing immunity conferred by the quadrivalent seasonal influenza vaccine. These data provide a proof-of-concept for broad, pre-exposure protection against a potential future pandemic using the intranasal administration route. Studies in humans should assess if autonomous administration of a broadly-neutralizing monoclonal antibody is safe and effective and can thus contribute to pandemic preparedness.

Since 2020, A(H5N1) has become a year-round rather than a seasonal infection, resulting in a dramatic increase in poultry losses due to death, measurable declines in wildlife bird populations in many regions of the world, and culling (~ 190 M in 2021–2023 alone, compared to ~ 195 M in 2005–2019)3. The World Health Organization has reported 878 cases of human infection with A(H5N1) since 2003, of which 458 were fatal (case fatality rate of 52%)4. However, to date the basic reproductive number R0 in these outbreaks has been below unity in value and hence they have not triggered epidemics in humans. The threat to humans has been growing, however: spillover into mammals has led to mammalian adaptation and resulted in mutations previously shown to enable airborne transmission between ferrets in gain-of-function experiments (e.g. PB2 E67K)5,6,7.No fast-acting prophylactics are available to prevent infection with a future A(H5N1) strain that could be transmitted between humans. Some existing antiviral drugs for seasonal influenza cross-protect against A(H5N1), but these are mostly suitable as post-exposure treatments and concomitant risk of resistance from viral escape mutants8,9. Post-exposure transfer of convalescent serum is effective, but supply constraints and cost make this an unsuitable treatment on a larger scale10. Some governments have a stockpile of H5 vaccines (US—vaccine doses for 20 million people11,12) or advance purchase agreements (UK—100 million vaccine doses13). However, these vaccines may not work if another H5 subtype (e.g. H5N2, H5N8) spills over to humans. Furthermore, the recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic showed that vaccination, although highly important to avert severe disease, does not necessarily prevent infection and associated spread14, especially when vaccine roll-out is still ongoing and before the vaccine has elicited antibody responses in a sufficient proportion of the population. Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies have saved lives of infected patients during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, but no prophylactic monoclonal antibodies have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or European Medicines Agency (EMA).Prophylactic monoclonal antibodies could prevent community spread in the period before and during vaccination campaigns, but pre-exposure administration of anti-influenza antibodies through the systemic route has failed in human trials15, with VIR-2482 as latest example. Currently, it is unknown whether passive immunization with antibodies delivered into the nasal cavity, at the port of entry for influenza virus, could slow down a pandemic in the period before and during vaccine roll-out.Here, we assess in vitro breadth of a broadly neutralizing human monoclonal antibody, CR9114, against a range of influenza A(H5) strains from various subtypes. We report intranasal prophylactic protection by CR9114 against lethal H5N1 challenge in mice with and without pre-existing immunity conferred by the quadrivalent seasonal influenza vaccine.ResultsPotency and breadth of human monoclonal IgG1 antibody CR9114CR9114 is a human monoclonal IgG1 antibody that targets an epitope on the hemagglutinin (HA) stalk domain of influenza A1, A2 and B16. Its flexible paratope enables binding to all influenza A subtypes and both influenza B lineages17. Previous research has suggested that CR9114 is a product of sequential exposure of its donor to influenza H1N1, H3N2 and then influenza B18. A crystal structure of the CR9114-H5N1 hemagglutinin (HA) complex with epitope-to-paratope interactions is available (PDB ID: 4FQI). The epitope of CR9114 on the HA of A/Vietnam/1203/2004 consists of 7 residues in HA1 subunit and 14 in the HA2 subunit, with 6 residues (2 in the HA1 and 4 in the HA2) forming H-bonds with the antibody (Fig. 1A)16.Figure 1CR9114 neutralizes H5 strains belonging to different clades in vitro due to the high level of conservation of its epitope, and even in case of epitope substitutions. (A) CR9114’s epitope on A/Vietnam/1203/2004 HA16. The surfaces of HA1 and HA2 subunits are shown in white and grey, respectively.

Residues in yellow are fully conserved, whereas residues in red have been substituted in at least one of the tested strains. Figure 1A, C and G have been generated in Mol* Viewer19 with PDB ID: 4FQI. Single-letter abbreviations for amino acids: A Ala, D Asp, G Gly, H His, I Ile, K Lys, L Leu, M Met, N Asn, P Pro, Q Gln, S Ser, T Thr, V Val, W Trp.Full size imageWe tested CR9114’s neutralization potency against phylogenetically distant influenza H5 strains. We selected ten strains isolated between 1997 and 2020, from diverse subtypes (H5N1, H5N2, H5N6, and H5N8) and clades (0, 1, 2.1.3.2, 2.2, 2.3.4.4, 2.3.4.4b, 2.3.4.4c, 2.3.4.4 h, Am_nonGsGD, and EA-nonGsGD), including A/Vietnam/1203/2004 as a reference strain (Fig. 1B, Supplementary Table S1). Protein sequence alignment of the tested strains against the A/Vietnam/1203/2004 HA reveals the high level of conservation of CR9114’s epitope on H5 HA (Fig. 1C,D). In seven strains, the sequence identity is 100% compared to the reference strain. Two strains (clades 2.3.4.4 h and EA_nonGsGD) have cumulated one amino acid substitution, and one strain (clade Am_nonGsGD) has cumulated more than one substitution (Fig. 1E,G). The two most phylogenetically distant strains (clades Am_nonGsGD and EA_nonGsGD) share the same substitution (V394I). Overall, the amino acid sequence of the CR9114’s epitope (and, in general, the stalk domain) is far more conserved than the full-length HA and the globular head domain, even in the strains that cumulated substitutions. The globular head domain always shows the highest genetic variability between strains.CR9114 potently neutralizes all tested strains with IC50 values in the range of 0.646–86.6 ng/mL (Fig. 1F), including H5 strains with other neuraminidase subtypes than N1 (N2, N6, N8) or from other clades than clade 1. The most potently neutralized strain, A/chicken/Mexico/07/2007 (IC50 = 0.646 ng/mL), carries three mutations compared to A/Vietnam/1203/2004. The three mutated residues, L305, N392 and L394, are also common in H1N1 strains. Both other strains with epitope mutations compared to A/Vietnam/1203/2004 are also potently neutralized (IC50 = 6.75 ng/mL and 13.38 ng/mL). The least potently neutralized strain is also phylogenetically furthest removed from A/chicken/Mexico/07/2007.These data suggest that phylogenetic distance from A/chicken/Mexico/07/2007 is a bigger factor in neutralizing potency of CR9114 than phylogenetic distance from A/Vietnam/1203/2004, or substitutions in the epitope compared to A/Vietnam/1203/2004. Although sequence identity of the CR9114 epitope on A/chicken/Mexico/07/2007 is lower compared to that on A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (85.71%), it has the highest sequence identity with the epitope on the consensus H1N1 strain (76.2%) compared to the other strains (A/mallard/Netherlands/41/2015: 66.7%; all other strains: 61.9%; see Supplementary Table S3).Intranasally-delivered CR9114 protects mice against lethal A(H5N1) challenge at low dosage, with and without pre-existing immunityWe compared pre-exposure efficacy of intranasally-administered CR9114 against A(H5N1) both in naïve mice and mice immunized with seasonal influenza. The mice that received quadrivalent Influvac® seasonal flu vaccine (N = 30) had high hemagglutinin inhibition titers against A(H1), A(H3), B/Yam and B/Vic (range 28–320; Supplementary Table S2), whereas the mice injected with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; N = 30) had titers below lower limit of detection.Intranasal CR9114 (high dosage 100 µg—5 mg/kg assuming each mouse weights 20 g—or low dosage 4 µg—0.2 mg/kg) or PBS were administered 24 h before viral challenge (Fig. 2A,B). Mice that received intranasal PBS all died within 9 days, irrespective of seasonal vaccination status. CR9114 protected 100% of mice from mortality and weight loss even at the low dosage of 4 µg, both in the presence and absence of pre-existing immunity conferred by the seasonal vaccine (Fig. 2C,D).Figure 2Prophylactic intranasal administration of CR9114 protects mice against A(H5N1), both in the absence and in the presence of pre-existing immunity elicited by the seasonal influenza vaccine.

IM intramuscular, IN intranasal.Full size imageDiscussionIn this study, we have shown that pre-exposure passive immunization with the broadly-neutralizing antibody CR9114 via the intranasal route fully protects mice against lethal A(H5N1) challenge irrespective of the presence or absence of immunity against seasonal influenza while, as expected, the seasonal vaccine did not. An in vivo proof-of-concept is a prerequisite for clinical development, but studies into safety and efficacy are needed to extend our findings to humans.If—or when20—A(H5N1) acquires the capacity for human-to-human transmission, the virus encounters populations lacking strong pre-existing immunity against H5. In our study, mice were not protected by the quadrivalent seasonal influenza vaccine, even though it contains H1 antigen, which belongs, like H5, to influenza group A1. In humans, it has also been shown that seasonal vaccination does not lead to in vitro heterosubtypic protection: the trivalent seasonal vaccine leads to increased serum titers against H1N1 but not H5N121. An in vivo study with human-to-mouse serum transfer showed that serum of a minority of people (9/25) cross-protects against H5N1, but only shortly after seasonal influenza vaccination. For 9 out of 25 vaccinated individuals, transferred post-vaccination serum protected mice against lethal H5N1 challenge. The authors showed that protection was transient, and not boosted by subsequent repeated vaccination22. Of note, some people may be cross-protected against H5N1 because of high serum titers against N1, elicited by prior infection to H1N1, or prior vaccination23.It is difficult to prepare for a pandemic, as it is unknown which zoonotic threats spillover to humans. Tools for pandemic preparedness toolbox should therefore be broad, and prepare against a range of known and unknown viruses. We showed that the CR9114 epitope is conserved on H5 strains from different clades and that CR9114 potently neutralizes H5 pseudotypes expressing N1, N2, N6, and N8. The most potently neutralized H5N1 strain has the highest sequence identity in the CR9114 epitope with H1N1 viruses. However, even viruses with different residues in the CR9114 epitope are potently neutralized by CR9114. This is in line with previous research, which showed that CR9114 can tolerate most of the mutations in the 21 residues of its epitope, as it binds strains with a variety of point mutations16.These results suggest a high tolerability of CR9114 to variation in influenza H5 strains. It is not possible to investigate the limits to tolerability of variation in influenza H5 strains in escape studies, as such ‘gain-of-function’ experiments are highly regulated because of the risks for creating highly pathogenic strains. However, escape of H1N1 strains from CR9114 has been investigated. No H1N1 escape mutants have been found after in vitro passaging of H1N1 under pressure of CR911424. CR9114 retained binding ability, sufficient neutralization potency and Fc and FcR-mediated effector functions to the resulting virus (in contrast to other antibodies tested). Another study tested all possible amino acid substitutions in on three H1N1 strains, in the 8 residues that are involved in binding to CR9114 (~ 150 viral variants with single mutations; ~ 10,000 viral variants with double mutations). None of these substitutions affected the ability of CR9114 to bind, neutralize or protect against these strains.We tested CR9114 neutralizing activity on pseudotyped viruses rather than live virus. Pseudotypes viruses do not produce replication-competent progeny and therefore do not require high biosafety laboratories for handling25. Meta-analyses have shown that pseudovirus neutralization highly correlates with live virus neutralization. Moreover, pseudovirus neutralization assays are highly sensitive, although pseudotyped virus may differ in distribution of hemagglutinin and neuraminidase glycoproteins on the virion compared to live virus26.As CR9114 also potently inhibits other HA and NA subtypes, including H3, H7, N7 and N8, and protects against influenza A and B strains, the findings reported herein may also generalize to other zoonotic threats, such as H5N8, H3N8 and H7N717. It also neutralizes influenza subtypes like H17 and H18, which had not yet been discovered when the antibody CR9114 was found17. Broadly-neutralizing antibodies like CR9114, that protect against all known subtypes of a particular viral family, could therefore constitute a broad tool for pandemic preparedness. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has shown that, if needed, antibodies against pandemic viruses can be developed relatively fast—this was a worldwide, billion-dollar effort resulting in various antibodies approved by the FDA and EMA through emergency authorization pathways. Retraction of emergency authorization was also fast when new variants escaped binding by antibodies that targeted areas on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that were highly mutable. Most of the therapeutic antibodies targeted such highly mutable areas on the spike, and did not retain efficacy with delta and omicron variants14. Currently, only two therapeutic antibody products (bebtelovimab and combination therapy tixagevimab-cilgavimab) still neutralize some of the circulating omicron variants in vitro27.Intranasal prophylaxis using an antibody like CR9114 may allow for short-term control because it can be autonomously administered and provides immediate protection, possibly against infection and transmission as well as from severe disease28,29,30. This can be especially useful during vaccine roll-out: avian influenza HAs like H5 are less immunogenic than human influenza HAs (or SARS-CoV-2), and therefore require multiple dosages and longer time until immunity is elicited31. Once sufficient people have been immunized, vaccination could provide the advantage of durable protection against severe disease. Intranasal antibody sprays could still be used for the immunocompromised and elderly, who tend to have poorer immune responses to vaccination, whereas intranasal antibody prophylaxis is equally effective across all age groups. Furthermore, local outbreaks or superspreading events with high risk of infection could be prevented or curbed with intranasal antibody prophylaxis32.We showed prophylactic efficacy of CR9114 administered intranasally, 24 h before challenge. The maximum window of protection is probably longer. One study showed that 1 mg/kg intranasal CR6261, another VH1-69 antibody which has 86% sequence identity with the heavy chain of CR9114, protects from 168 h (7 days) prior to lethal H1N1 challenge up to 24 h post-infection30. Intranasal administration of CR6261 was still effective against H1N1 at 5, 6 and 7 days before challenge, whereas systemic administration (intraperitoneal injection) was not, suggesting an advantage of intranasal administration. Other antibodies also had windows of protection from at least 168–120 h pre-exposure (4–7 days) to at least 24 h post-exposure28,29,30.In a real-world pandemic scenario, the frequency of intranasal prophylaxis administration is contingent on the duration of the window of protection. Despite clearance mechanisms of the intranasal mucosa33,34, the window of protection in mice is multiple days, even at low dosages28,29. Clinical trials in humans, investigating intranasal antibody pharmacokinetics, are needed to guide dose finding, prophylactic antibody thresholds, and investigate corresponding therapy adherence35.From the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak we learned that early intervention aiming at limiting human-to-human virus transmission is key in preventing pandemic growth, widespread lockdowns, hospitalizations, and mortality. Innovations for immediate protection in the early phase of human-to-human transmission of emerging viral infections are needed; if available, intranasally administered antibodies that block infection at the port of viral entry may have a crucial role in providing early protection against an infection with H5N1 influenza virus. Collaboration between professionals in public health, immunology, virology, and clinical development will be vital to fill the gap in the pandemic preparedness toolbox in time for the next threat.Material and methods (online)Challenge studyA challenge study in the murine model was performed to evaluate the impact of vaccine-induced immunity to seasonal influenza against influenza A/HK/156/97 (H5N1) infection and the prophylactic efficacy of intranasal administration of CR9114 against influenza A/HK/156/97.Here the primary objective was defined as a significant improvement in survival with the vaccinated and treated with CR9114 groups in comparison to the vaccinated control group and the not vaccinated and treated with CR9114 groups in comparison to the not vaccinated control group. The secondary objective was defined as a significant reduction in bodyweight loss for the same comparisons.With 10 animals per group, the study was powered to have at least 80% power to detect a 58% difference in survival between the control group and the treatment groups, assuming 0% survival in the vehicle control group (2-sided Fisher’s exact test at a 5% significance level, R package statmod version 1.4.36).During the acclimatization period, all mice (n = 60) remained healthy and were considered suitable for enrolment into the study on the day of vaccination (study day -28). There were no abnormal health observations during the period between vaccination and challenge of the animals. All mice anesthetized prior to CR9114 administration on study day -1 recovered well from the anesthesia. One mouse (vaccinated, to be treated with 4 µg CR9114) died during anesthesia on study day 0. Therefore, this mouse was excluded from statistical analysis.Six to seven weeks old female BALB/c mice (average weight 20 mg) were assigned to treatment groups using a digital randomizer (n = 10 per group, except the vaccinated group receiving 4 µg CR9114, where n = 9) received an intramuscular dose of 3 μg HA antigen per influenza strain of the seasonal influenza Influvac® quadrivalent vaccine or PBS 28 days before virus challenge. The four vaccine strains were: A/Victoria/2570/2019 (H1N1), A/Cambodia/e0826360/2020 (H3N2), B/Washington/02/2019 (B/Victoria) and B/Phuket/3073/2013 (B/Yamagata).The personnel involved in dose administration and/or monitoring of the animals were blinded for the treatment received by the animals, as vials containing the test item or placebo were encoded with the group number without any further information on the actual content of the vials.One day before virus challenge, blood samples were obtained to assess HI antibody titers elicited 4 weeks post immunization. Following blood sampling, the mice received an intranasal dose of 100 µL CR9114 (100 or 4 µg) or PBS. Two PBS control groups were included, one for the vaccinated and one for the PBS control arm. Before intranasal administration of the virus, CR9114 or PBS, the mice were anesthetized with a mixture of 200 µL ketamine-xylazine by intraperitoneal injection. On study day 0 mice were challenged with 50 µL of approximately 12.5 LD50 of A/HK/156/97 influenza virus by intranasal inoculation.In both study arms, mice were monitored daily for survival and body weight loss from study day –1 until the end of the study at day 21. Mice were declared moribund and euthanized immediately when they displayed any of the following signs: rough coat, rolled up position, labored breathing, inactivity in response to manipulation/handlings. At the end of the study on day 21, or earlier when deemed necessary (humane endpoint), mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation.Serum sample analysis was performed to determine HI titers in pooled serum samples from mice either vaccinated or not with seasonal influenza vaccine. The two pools generated were measured using a hemagglutination inhibition assay for the detection of influenza specific antibodies against the viruses in the Influvac® vaccine. Following performance of the HI assay, results were calculated and expressed as geometric mean HI titers with a LOD of 5. All negative samples were given a value of ≤ 5.Survival proportions after viral challenge were analyzed using a 2-sided Fisher’s exact test and change in body weight was analyzed using an Area Under the Curve (AUC) analysis. If a mouse was found dead or euthanized during the study, the mouse was weighed, and this measurement was carried forward until the end of the study. The weight per mouse at day 0 was used as baseline and weight change was determined relative to baseline. The net AUCs were compared using a Welch t-test. Comparisons to the control (PBS) group were performed using a stepwise approach within each vaccination arm starting with the highest antibody dose conditionally testing the lower dose if the previous step was statistically significant. Statistical analysis was performed using R (v4.1.0) and statistical significance was set at α = 0.05.All animal procedures were performed in accordance with the protocols and reviewed and approved by the Dutch Central Authority for Scientific Procedures on Animals.Phylogenetic tree and protein sequence alignmentAmino acid fasta files for HA gene from 754 sequences sampled between December 1959 and December 2020 were downloaded from GISAID EpiFlu as well as the respective metadata file up to October 10, 2023 (https://gisaid.org/). The detailed list is available in the accompanying acknowledgement table and in the Supplementary Table S1 for the strains tested in the pseudotype virus neutralization assay. The HA aminoacid sequences for A/Anhui/2021_00011/2020|H5N6 (EPI1848299), A/Sichuan/26221/2014 (EPI533583), and A/Hong_Kong/156/1997 (EPI1328382) were collected by GISAID. The HA sequences for A/Vietnam/1204/2004 (EF541404), A/gyrfalcon/Washington/41088_6/2014 (KP307984), A/Indonesia/5/2005 (CY116646), A/mallard_duck/Netherlands/41/2015 (MF694083), A/chicken/Mexico/07/2007 (KJ729343), A/Anhui/1/2005 (DQ371928), and A/whooper_swan/Mongolia/244/2005 (EU723707) were collected by IRD.The phylogenetic tree was built based on the Nextstrain workflow for influenza A/H5NX virus evolution with minor changes (available at https://github.comextstrain/avian-flu and downloaded on October 12, 2023). A/chicken/Scotland/1959 (the oldest dated strain GISAID, clade EA_nonGsGD) was used as a root for building the tree. After processing and quality filtering, 632 genomes were retained including the 10 tested ones. Tree visualization and plotting were done with ggtree36 and treeio37 R packages. R version 4.2.2 (2022–10-31). Platform: aarch64-apple-darwin20 (64-bit). Running under: macOS 14.0. The HA amino acid sequences have been aligned using Clustal X with standard settings.Breadth of neutralizationThe pseudotype neutralization assay was performed following the protocol by Ferrara et al. published in Methods Protoc38. with the Influenza A/H5 strains listed in Supplementary table S1. CR9114 concentrations used were in the range of 0.49–1000 ng/mL. As described in the protocol, fifty microliters of PV at a titer of 1.0 × 106 RLU/well as determined via titration was then added to the mAb. This mixture was incubated for 1 h at 37 ◦C, 5% CO2. Afterwards, 50 µL of 1.5 × 104 HEK293T/17 cells were added to each well. PV only (equivalent to 0% neutralization) and cell only controls with no virus (equivalent to 100% neutralization control) were also included in the test plate. Plates were incubated for 48 h at 37 ◦C and 5% CO2. Media was removed and 25 µL of the Bright-Glo® luciferase assay substrate added to each well. Plates were then read using the GloMax® Navigator (Promega, Southampton, UK) using the Promega GloMax® Luminescence Quick-Read protocol.Relative Light Units (RLU) values were normalized relative to the PV only and cells only, where PV only and cell only represent respectively a 0% and 100% neutralization response. The resulting neutralization-antibody dose response curve was modelled using a 4-parameter logistic curve with fixed plateaus at 0 and 100% and a sample specific slope and IC50. The IC50 values presented in Fig. 1F are the geometric mean of the IC50 values calculated for one, two, or three independent experiments.Ethical approval statementAll animal procedures were performed in accordance with the protocols and reviewed and approved by the Dutch Central Authority for Scientific Procedures on Animals.

(WCAX) - A bobcat found in Vermont has tested positive for the bird flu.According to officials at Vermont Fish and Wildlife, a lab test confirmed the preliminary positive result for avian influenza in the animal. However, officials are still waiting on a second lab test, which may take several weeks to receive.The bobcat and two red-tailed hawks were found dead in Cornwall. The hawks also tested positive for bird flu.Avian influenza is primarily found in birds and can be fatal. Experts say it is fairly rare for a mammal to contract the disease. The bobcat is the first mammal in Vermont to test positive. However, there have been detections in mammals in other states, including Connecticut, Maine and New York. Click here for the USDA’s listing of 2022-2024 Detections of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza in Mammals.Wildlife officials say the risk to humans from bird flu remains low. They say their recommendations for people are unchanged since avian influenza was detected in Vermont in 2022-- mainly to avoid direct contact with wild birds.“Observe wild birds only from a distance and practice good hygiene around domestic fowl. Practice good biosecurity by keeping domestic fowl and other pets away from areas where wild birds gather, like bird feeding stations or duck ponds,” David Sausville, the wildlife management program manager with Vermont Fish and Wildlife said in a statement.Bird flu is transmitted from infected birds by saliva, mucus or feces.

Find out more Acknowledgements Throughout 2022, the number of reported mortalities thought to be caused by Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) indicated the disease posed a threat of immediate conservation concern. In response, the RSPB led a UK-wide programme of additional targeted seabird population counts: the HPAI Seabird Survey Project. The project was conducted in 2023, using a coordinated and collaborative approach across statutory bodies and conservation organisations. You can read the HPAI Surveys Project Report below. Gannet ChickHPAI Surveys Report Read reportA driver of devastating declines The current strain of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI H5N1) has had a significant impact on our globally important seabird populations since it first appeared in the UK in 2021. As many as 21 of our 25 regularly breeding seabird species have tested positive for the virus, and tens of thousands of seabirds have died. For more detailed information, watch the video from RSPB Scotland below, where Senior Policy Officer Claire Smith talks about the disease and its impacts. You can also read more on our dedicated Avian Flu webpage. Bird flu update as new survey data shows the impact on seabirds6:26The tides are turning for seabird populations previously in the positive The project saw 14 species counted including Gannet, Black-headed Gull, Great Skua, Herring Gull, Kittiwake, Roseate Tern and Guillemot. Count results are available for 13 of those species. From those results, nine species have shown declines of over 10% across the sites surveyed. For three key species, these declines have reversed previously positive population trends: GannetsGannets were one of the worst-hit species in the 2022 breeding season, with at least 11,000 deaths recorded across Scotland and 5,000 deaths on the RSPB island reserve of Grassholm, Wales. The UK supports over half of the world’s Gannets. Our surveys show a 25% decline in breeding numbers of this species at sites surveyed across the UK in 2023. A particularly severe decline of 54% was documented in Wales, bringing the population numbers there to a low not seen since the 1960s. A Northern Gannet with Avian InfluenzaGreat SkuaScotland holds 60% of the global population of this species, which was also among the worst hit in 2022, with at least 2,500 reported dead. Our results have shown a 76% decline in breeding numbers of this species across its range in Scotland, with declines of over 80% at some surveyed sites. A deceased Great Skua as the result of Avian InfluenzaRoseate Tern The only functioning breeding colony of this Red-listed species in the UK is on the RSPB reserve of Coquet Island, England and many were lost to HPAI during the 2022 breeding season. Counts in 2023 have revealed a 21% decline in the Coquet breeding population since before the HPAI outbreak. Two Roseate Terns deceased from Avian InfluenzaWhat does this mean? This hugely important work comes after the recent Seabirds Count census which showed that our seabirds were already in serious trouble, with 62% of species in decline in the UK. The results of these latest surveys demonstrate the need to take HPAI into account as a new and major threat to our internationally important seabird populations, which are facing numerous other challenges. The outbreak is ongoing across the globe, and this further emphasises the urgency with which we need to continue to expand monitoring and resilience-building actions to save our already struggling seabirds.

Photo: NIAID/Flickr cc The latest confirmed case is a 16-year-old boy who didn't have respiratory symptoms. The boy and his deceased younger brother are from Kratie province in northeastern Cambodia. The health ministry didn't say if the teen had any other symptoms, but it said it continues to track contacts and has distributed oseltamivir to close contacts of confirmed cases. Earlier report noted poultry deaths The current statement didn't have any details about the teen's exposure. The ministry statement last week announcing his brother's illness and death said poultry had died at the patient's home and that dead birds were eaten. Cambodia has now reported 10 human H5N1 cases since 2023, part of rise in cases that follows a decade-long lapse in cases. The country's recent cases have involved an older H5N1 clade (2.3.2.1c) that is known to circulate in the country's poultry. It is different than the newer H5N1 clade (2.3.4.4b) that is circulating widely in wild birds and poultry in multiple world regions, with sporadic detections in mammals and humans. CDC tracking BA.2.87.1 SARS-CoV-2 variant News brief Lisa Schnirring Topics COVID-19 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently announced that it is monitoring a newly identified SARS-CoV-2 variant called BA.2.87.1 from South Africa that has mutations that may pose a risk of immune escape, but so far there's no sign that it is spreading widely. NIAID/Flickr cc South African scientists have identified nine BA.2.87.1 sequences in samples that were collected between September and December of 2023. No cases have been identified outside of South Africa. "The fact that only nine cases have been detected in one country since the first specimen was collected in September suggests it does not appear to be highly transmissible – at least so far," the CDC said in a February 9 statement. South African cases reported from three provinces In South Africa, though, the cases were reported from three provinces over 3 months, suggesting that BA.2.87.1 can spread among people, the CDC said. The CDC said it is monitoring BA.2.87.1 because it has more than 30 changes in the spike protein compared to XBB.1.5, the variant covered by the current monovalent vaccine. The CDC said variants with multiple spike protein changes could increase the potential for immune escape from earlier infection or vaccination. Experience with BA.2.86 and its JN.1 offshoot was a reminder that a variant's ability to transmit can change quickly over time. BA.2.87.1 isn't fueling a detectable increase in South Africa's COVID cases, the CDC said. So far, it's not clear how well the current vaccine would protect against BA.2.87.1, but the group added that recent experience with the JN.1 variant suggests that the current COVID vaccine can help protect against a diverse range of variants. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) is also tracking BA.2.87.1 as a variant under monitoring (VUM). Chinese study finds excessive antibiotic use for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease News brief Chris Dall, MA Topics Antimicrobial Stewardship A large-scale, population-based study in China reports that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients were nearly eight times more likely to use antibiotics than the general population and received nearly twice as many antibiotic prescriptions, researchers reported late last week in the Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy. Using prescription data and survey responses from participants aged 40 years and older in a cohort of residents from Shanghai's Songjian District, researchers with Fudan University assessed correlations between COPD, the percentage of antibiotic use, and the average rate of prescribing of different types of antibiotics compared with the general population. While antibiotics are commonly used to manage acute exacerbations of COPD in China, there are concerns that some of this use is inappropriate and that frequent antibiotic use in COPD patients is creating a vicious cycle of antimicrobial-resistant infections that require more antibiotics. High-priority group for stewardship efforts A total of 34,576 people were included in the study, 1,594 (4.6%) of whom were COPD patients. Over 6 years of follow-up, the percentage of antibiotic use for COPD patients was 98.4%, which was 7.88 (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.24 to 11.85) times that for non-COPD patients after adjusting for potential confounders. The prescribing rate was 3,220 prescriptions per 1,000 person-years for COPD patients, which was 1.96 (95% CI, 1.87 to 2.06) times that for non-COPD patients. Macrolides, lincosamides, streptogramins, quinolones, and other beta-lactams were the most commonly used antibiotics by COPD patients. Except for aminoglycosides, both the percentage of antibiotic use and the rate of antibiotic prescribing for all antibiotics were increased in COPD patients, who were 1.34 (95% CI, 1.20 to 1.50) times more likely to be prescribed a maximum of two antibiotics and 2.77 (95% CI, 2.47 to 3.11) times more likely to use antibiotics intravenously. The study authors say the findings suggest COPD patients are a high-priority group for the management of antibiotic use in communities. Study: COVID-19 raises risk of heart attack in HIV patients News brief Stephanie Soucheray, MA Topics COVID-19 HIV/AIDS A large study in Spain finds that COVID-19 is associated with a 30% increased risk of major cardiovascular events in people with HIV during the year following infection. The study is published in Clinical Microbiology and Infection. Using a population of people in Catalonia with HIV (PWH) who had a documented COVID-19 infection, plus PWH with no COVID infections, the authors of the study estimated the incidence rate (IR) of a first cardiovascular event (CVE) after COVID-19 during an average follow-up period of 243 days. Included were 4,199 PWH with and 14,004 PWH without COVID-19 infections, 82% of all study subjects were men, and the average age was 47. Overall, 211 PWH with COVID-19 and 621 without developed CVE, the authors said, with an IR of 70.2 and 56.8 per 1,000 person-years, respectively. Even mild infections pose risk COVID-19 was associated with a 30% increased subsequent risk of CVE (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.30; 95% confidence interval, 1.09 to 1.55). Risk was highest in the 6 months following acute infection, and there was no association with COVID-19 severity and subsequent CVE, suggesting that even mild to moderate infections increased the risk. "Even while the absolute rates of CVE in PWH have significantly declined in recent years, they continue to have a 1.5-2-fold greater relative risk compared to individuals without HIV," the authors wrote. "Therefore, the confirmation that the incidence of major CVE is increased the year following COVID-19 in PWH, including those non-hospitalized or without prior CVE, deserves major awareness." The authors said reasons for the increased risk are unknown and multifactorial. Earlier studies have suggested PWH have elevated levels of T-cell and inflammatory markers after COVID-19. Data from China suggest no survival benefit of two antiviral drugs in elderly COVID patients News brief Mary Van Beusekom, MS Topics COVID-19 gorodenkoff / iStock An observational study in eClinicalMedicine suggests that the antiviral drugs azvudine and nirmatrelviritonavir (Paxlovid) were similarly ineffective in preventing death in elderly patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in China, although the authors acknowledge that the findings may be subject to confounding factors and bias. Azvudine has conditional approval for treatment of viral diseases such as COVID-19 and AIDS in China but isn't approved for use in the United States, where Paxlovid is approved for treatment of mild or moderate COVID-19 in high-risk adults. Researchers from the Chinese PLA General Hospital in Beijing evaluated the electronic medical records of 249 COVID-19 patients with an average age of 91.4 years hospitalized in December 2022 and January 2023. Of all patients, 128 received azvudine, 66 were given Paxlovid, and 55 received no antiviral. Average follow-up was 84 days. "The proportion of severe illness and death caused by COVID-19 among the elderly is the highest among all age groups, and elderly patients are commonly accompanied by multi-disease and multi-reuse drugs," the study authors noted, adding that caution must be taken when prescribing drugs for these patients. Potential confounding factors, bias A total of 77 patients (31%) died during follow-up. Neither antiviral demonstrated a survival benefit, with a Cox analysis of all-cause death showing a 0.73 risk of death in the azvudine group and 0.80 in Paxlovid recipients compared with no antiviral treatment. The proportion of severe illness and death caused by COVID-19 among the elderly is the highest among all age groups, and elderly patients are commonly accompanied by multi-disease and multi-reuse drugs. The researchers noted several potential reasons for the lack of clinical benefit, including the advanced age, chronic illness burden, and disease severity among participants and inadequate study power to detect differences. "Finally, the cause of selection bias cannot be ruled out because patients with more severe clinical presentations may have been preferentially selected by clinicians to receive nirmatrelviritonavir," they wrote. "In that case, patients who received nirmatrelviritonavir would be expected to have worse outcomes, which could obscure a potential therapeutic benefit of nirmatrelviritonavir." Quick takes: Listeria recalls expand, CDC mpox vaccine reminder, Oregon plague case News brief Lisa Schnirring Topics Listeria Mpox Plague Several US food companies have issued recalls because they contain cheese and dairy ingredients made by a California company at the center of an investigation into a multistate Listeria monocytogenes outbreak. In an outbreak update, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lists 61 foods on a recall list, which include the earlier recalled products from Rizo-Lopez Foods, plus several other products from other companies that used Rizo-Lopez Food ingredients. The list of foods containing potentially tainted ingredients includes items such as meal kits, salad kits, layered tips, and salad dressings. The number of outbreak illnesses remains at 26 cases, 2 of them fatal, from 11 states. Though mpox cases in the United States have declined sharply since the outbreak peak in the summer of 2022, small clusters of cases continue to be reported, prompting a vaccination reminder today from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In October 2023, the CDC recommended that people in risk groups ages 18 and older receive two doses of the Jynneos vaccine to reduce the risk of continued transmission. However, in a Clinician Outreach and Communication Activity (COCA) e-mail notice today, the CDC said only one in four of the approximately 2 million eligible people have received two doses. It urged clinicians to remain diligent about taking patients' sexual histories and recommending Jynneos to those who are eligible. A recent surveillance update said 169 mpox cases have been reported in US so far this year. In Oregon, public health officials in Deschutes County have reported a human plague infection in a person who likely contracted the disease from his or her symptomatic pet cat. The case marks Oregon's first human plague case since 2015, according to a statement. The patient's illness was identified early in the disease, posing a low risk to the community. A report from NBC News quoting a county health official said the patient was hospitalized with a draining abscess that progressed to the bloodstream but has responded well to antibiotic treatment. Investigators have found no other cases. The disease can spread to people or animals through a bite from an infected flea or contact with an animal infected with Yersinia pestis. In central Oregon, the animals most likely to carry plague are squirrels and chipmunks, but mice and other rodents can all carry the bacteria.

If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission.Unless you’ve had the flu recently enough that the sheer misery is fresh in your mind, you might think it’s not that big a deal. But while plenty of people who get influenza simply spend enough time in bed to rewatch the entire Game of Thrones series (speaking from experience here) and then move on with their lives, the virus can be much more than a wintertime nuisance.In fact, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that the flu is responsible for up to 700,000 hospitalizations—and more than 50,000 deaths—in the US each year, due to a laundry list of complications it can cause. (And flu season isn’t limited to the big first wave of illnesses, which tends to take place annually around the December holidays—according to the most recent data about infection rates available from the CDC, we’re not quite out of the woods yet this year.) Catching this particular bug sometimes becomes much more serious than just having to take a few days off work, and that risk includes its potential consequences for your heart.One small 2018 study reported that people are over six times more likely to have a heart attack in the week following a flu diagnosis. (More recently, preliminary research that replicated that study showed a slightly weaker, but still significant, association between the two.) And while flu-driven havoc on the heart is more common among older people and those with cardiovascular conditions, everyone should be mindful of it, Thomas Russo, MD, chief of the division of infectious disease at the University at Buffalo School of Medicine in New York, tells SELF—yep, even if you’re in your 20s or 30s and seemingly healthy.Here’s what you should know about how the flu can affect your heart and how you can keep things ticking as usual, even if you do spend some time laid up sick in bed this season.Yes, the flu is a respiratory virus, but that doesn’t mean it only spells trouble for your nose, throat, and lungs.Though it’s less common for the flu to mess with your other organs, it can happen. “When we’re infected with influenza, our bodies react with inflammation to fight off the virus,” Estelle Darlyse Jean, MD, a board-certified non-invasive cardiologist with MedStar Heart & Vascular Institute in Maryland, tells SELF. It’s thought that “this process can rarely lead to cardiac complications, such as a heart attack, heart failure, inflammation of the heart muscle (myocarditis), and inflammation of the lining of the heart (pericarditis),” Dr. Jean says, because it increases stress on your heart and raises your blood pressure, which can, in turn, lead to clogs in your arteries that disrupt your blood flow. Some research performed on mice suggests that the flu virus can directly affect the heart’s cells, too, but more research is needed to determine whether this might affect humans in the same way.Who’s at the greatest risk of heart problems caused by the flu?Though anyone can be affected by flu-related heart issues, people with preexisting heart conditions like heart disease or hypertension (a.k.a. high blood pressure) are especially at risk, according to Dr. Jean. That’s a lot of people. An estimated 5.5% of American adults have heart disease, according to the CDC—and nearly half have high blood pressure. (These figures include more young folks than you might think: Research suggests that 27% of people in the US between the ages of 20 and 40 have hypertension, a well-established risk factor for various cardiovascular conditions.)Dr. Russo notes that heart-related health issues like hypertension and atherosclerosis (thickening or hardening of the arteries) sometimes start quietly developing in your 20s. Because that can sometimes happen without your feeling or showing any obvious symptoms, plenty of people go about their day-to-day lives without even knowing something is off, Dr. Russo says. This suggests that the actual rates of heart health issues in younger folks are likely higher than the official stats and that more people ultimately face a higher risk of heart complications with the flu than they might even know.As if that’s not troubling enough, having a heart issue (whether you’ve been diagnosed with one or not) can become life-threatening should the flu hit you hard. “When you have a heart that’s compromised to a degree or is only marginally supported, the stress and inflammation of an infection like the flu can basically push your heart over the edge, leading to a heart attack or an abnormal heart rhythm that could potentially be fatal,” Dr. Russo explains.Other health conditions—such as diabetes, kidney disease, a history of stroke, or a compromised immune system—can increase your risk of heart complications related to the flu, adds Dr. Jean. Otherwise, lifestyle factors like smoking, a sedentary lifestyle, and what you eat can also up your chance of flu-related cardiac trouble, both experts say. Usually, if you’re under 65 and otherwise healthy, you should only experience a mild case and recover just fine.Here’s when the flu poses the biggest risk to your heart—and the symptoms you should pay attention to.The risk of developing heart complications related to the flu is highest if you have a serious case that requires hospitalization: A 2020 study found that about 12% of adults hospitalized for the flu develop a serious and sudden heart complication, such as acute heart failure (in which the heart’s blood-pumping ability is significantly weakened) and acute ischemic heart disease (which reduces blood flow to the heart because of narrowed arteries). In the study, those at particular risk included older individuals and those with underlying heart disease.The risk of heart issues lingers even after you recover from your initial string of symptoms. “In the weeks following influenza infection, it’s still possible that you could have a cardiac complication, probably from ongoing inflammation that hasn’t completely resolved,” Dr. Russo explains.If you’re sick with the flu right now or newly on the mend, the experts SELF spoke with recommend knowing what symptoms are commonly associated with cardiac emergencies, including heart failure, heart attack, and stroke, in case you need to seek immediate care.“Chest discomfort, pain in the arms, back, neck, jaw, or stomach, shortness of breath, nausea, cold sweats, and lightheadedness can all indicate a heart attack” or other cardiac events, says Dr. Jean, and “drooping of the face, arm weakness, and speech difficulty can signal a stroke.”Don’t just assume these symptoms will pass on their own or that they’re not serious, Dr. Russo urges. He always recommends getting checked out if you have persistent chest pain or pressure or difficulty breathing either when you’re sick or after the rest of your flu symptoms alleviate—either could signal trouble for your heart or another serious complication from the flu. In those cases, heading to the ER is your best move, Dr. Russo says.How to protect your heart throughout flu seasonWhether you’ve had a run-in with the flu or not this winter, checking all the usual boxes to protect your health, in general, will help keep your immune system strong and minimize your risk of potential heart complications should you get sick: Think things like eating well and getting enough sleep (eight hours a night is the goal), according to Dr. Russo. As ever, wash your hands thoroughly and do your best to stay away from others who are or might be sick.The other no-brainer is to get your flu shot. Ideally, you should do this by the end of October, but the shot is available through late spring and offers protection after two weeks, so it’s not too late if you haven’t done it yet this year. Though the vaccine can’t guarantee you won’t catch the flu, “You’ll have a much milder illness and be less likely to land in the hospital and have bad consequences from an infection,” Dr. Russo says.If heart disease or risk factors for heart disease run in your family, Dr. Jean also recommends checking in with a primary care provider or making an appointment with a cardiologist to get a clear, current picture of your heart health, talk about any symptoms you might be experiencing, and create a lifestyle game plan to support your well-being.If you come down with the flu and are concerned about potential complications, see a doctor to talk through whether you should take prescription antiviral drugs, which can shorten the length of your illness, reduce or ease symptoms, and cut down on the chance of the flu contributing to a more serious health problem. If you do have preexisting heart issues, this is a generally good idea—if not, you can still take antiviral meds, but most people with mild flu symptoms don’t necessarily need to. Otherwise, rest up to help your immune system out as it fights off the virus—you’ll want to get as much sleep as you can to potentially feel better sooner.These aren’t just solid methods for keeping you out of a bed surrounded by a million crumpled up tissues: Thinking about flu as a potentially long-term cardiac illness and arming yourself with information and precautions accordingly might do your heart a lot of good in the long run.Related:We Never Got Flu Shots.

Ad ChoicesSevere strain of bird flu in Cape Cod, Bristol, Essex, MiddlesexSkip to main content HomeElection 2024Voter GuideLocalPoliticsCrimeEducationStateNation & World Severe strain of bird flu identified on Cape Cod, four other Mass. counties. What to know.Heather McCarron Cape Cod TimesBirds infected with Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza, a strain of the avian flu that causes severe symptoms, were recently identified in five Massachusetts counties, according to the Massachusetts Department of Agricultural Resources and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Along with its partner agencies, the state agriculture department reports it disposed of two non-commercial, mixed-species backyard flocks exhibiting HPAI symptoms — one on Cape Cod and one in Essex County, which encompasses the North Shore, Cape Ann and points north. The birds did not include any domestic poultry."Birds on the affected premises exhibited clinical signs consistent with HPAI and tested positive for the disease," according to the agency's Avian Influenza webpage.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is separately reporting on its Avian Influenza data map that, as of Wednesday, 150 birds were identified with HPAI in Barnstable County, 20 were identified in Essex County, 50 were identified in Bristol County, 20 were identified in Middlesex County and 260 were identified in Berkshire County.Mass Wildlife in recent days also received reports of dead and dying Canada geese with HPAI symptoms in Essex County and surrounding coastal areas, MDAR reports."Several samples have been collected for HPAI testing, and results are pending," the agency said.No information about which towns the infected birds were found in was provided by state and federal officials.John Herbert, Mass Audubon director of Bird Conservation, said because wild migratory birds such as Canada geese move around a lot, they can easily spread illness to other areas.Phu Mai, MDAR communications director, said in a Wednesday email that the agency cannot provide more specific details "due to privacy concerns" but emphasized that the agency is asking that "anyone who suspects HPAI to reach out to the appropriate agency" — MDAR for domestic birds and MassWildlife for wild birds.What is avian flu?Avian flu is an illness caused by a family of influenza viruses primarily spread among wild aquatic birds, including Canada geese, swans, wild ducks, sea gulls and other sea birds.Herbert said HPAI "is a highly pathogenic form of the avian flu," and domesticated poultry — chickens, turkeys, ducks and geese — and game birds, are very susceptible to the illness.Avian flu viruses are categorized as either Low Pathogenic Avian Influenza or Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza, according to the CDC, with the former causing mild or no symptoms and the latter causing severe, often fatal symptoms."It's just like any virus. The virus has changed and evolved. This one strain (HPAI) has been much more deadly," Herbert said.According to MDAR, "HPAI can strike suddenly and spread fast," and "infected poultry may die within hours of becoming infected."Can people contract bird flu?While people are rarely infected with avian influenza viruses, according to MDAR, it is not unheard of. Those who have "prolonged close contact with sick or dead birds infected with HPAI" are at the most risk of becoming infected, the agency said, but also emphasizes "the strains of the HPAI virus that have been identified in the U.S. over the past few years have not been linked to human illness."In the rare cases of human infection, transmission between people "has been limited, inefficient and not sustained," according to the state Department of Public Health.Even so, state officials urge people not to handle or feed any birds suspected of being infected.Bird flu symptoms in people are similar to the seasonal flu, including fever, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, muscle or body aches, headaches, fatigue, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing. Less common signs and symptoms include diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, or seizures.Can my pets get avian flu?Pets that eat infected dead or alive wild birds or that are exposed to environments where there may be high concentrations of the virus have occasionally been known to develop avian flu, according to the CDC, but the likelihood is low. Other mammals, such as foxes, skunks, bears, and even sea lions, have been known to contract the virus in similar ways, though it's also uncommon.The American Veterinary Medical Association notes that "captive or pet birds with access to the outdoors, where they could be exposed to infected wild birds," may get the avian flu as well, so contact with wild birds should be prevented.Can I get avian flu from my pets?According to the CDC, it is unlikely for people to get avian flu from an infected pet, but not impossible."If your pet is showing signs of illness compatible with bird flu virus infection and has been exposed to infected (sick or dead) wild birds/poultry, you should monitor your health for signs of fever or infection," the agency advises.Can birds at my birdfeeder carry avian flu?The CDC notes that "most common songbirds or other birds found in the yard, such as cardinals, robins, sparrows, blue jays, crows, or pigeons, do not usually carry bird flu viruses that are dangerous to poultry or people."Even so, usual death events of more than five birds in one location should be reported.What are the symptoms of avian flu in birds, and how does it spread?Symptoms of avian flu in infected birds, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, may include:Sudden death without clinical signsLack of energy and appetiteDecreased egg production or soft-shelled or misshapen eggsSwelling of head, comb, eyelid, wattles and hocksPurple discoloration of wattles, comb and legsNasal discharge, coughing, and sneezing;IncoordinationDiarrhea.The virus is spread through saliva, feces and nasal secretions.How do I protect my poultry from avian flu?Here are some tips from MDAR to prevent domestic poultry from having contact with wild birds, their feathers and droppings.Poultry owners should keep their birds away from wild birds, particularly wild waterfowl.Poultry owners with bodies of water on their property should discourage wild waterfowl from frequenting those areas. USDA provides tips here:www.aphis.usda.gov/publications/wildlife_damage/fsc-hpai-wildlife-practices-reduce.pdfEliminate standing water and prevent domestic birds from accessing ponds, streams and wetland areas that attract wild waterfowl.Avoid unnecessary movement of poultry between locations and be aware of the potential to carry HPAI-contaminated materials onto properties where birds are kept.New birds should be completely isolated for at least one month before joining the flock. Birds returning home from fairs or shows should also be isolated.Limit the number of people with access to your flock.Do not share equipment with other bird owners without thoroughly cleaning and disinfecting between locations.Create a written biosecurity plan detailing the precautions you take. This will allow others to take the same precautions should someone else need to care for your birds.How do I report sick, dead or dying domestic or wild birds?The public is asked to report sick, dead or dying domestic or wild birds. The behavior of birds can indicate illness, Herbert said, noting the virus "affects their neurological ability, so if they are acting kind of funny, not flying, or having trouble flying that's a sign before they die."Large groups of dead birds are also an indication of the virus, he said.To report on wild birds, contact Mass Wildlife at 508-389-6300, or USDA Wildlife Services at 866- 487-3297, or report observations of dead sea birds and other wild birds online at www.mass.gov/formseport-observations-of-dead-wild-birdsTo report on domestic birds, contact MDAR Animal Health at 617-626-1795 or go online to fill out the Poultry Disease Reporting Form at www.mass.gov/forms/poultry-disease-reporting-form, or call USDA Veterinary Services at 866-536-7593.Since sick birds produce large amounts of virus that contaminate the environment, and exposed birds can rapidly become infected, timely reporting is critical to preventing spread of the virus. Once a flock is tested and confirmed as infected with HPAI, any remaining birds will need to be humanely euthanized to control the spread of the disease.When reporting wild birds, report observations of any sick, injured, or deceased seabirds. For other species of wild birds, such as songbirds, only report observations of five or more birds found at a single location.

By Jane Byrne 14-Feb-2024 - Last updated on 15-Feb-2024 at 08:12 GMT Facebook Twitter Linkedin Email to a friend © GettyImages/solarseven Some countries have started vaccinating against bird flu, while others are in the process of allowing farmers to do so, according to an expert. We caught up with Claudia Garcia, head of global strategic marketing, poultry, Boehringer Ingelheim, at IPPE 2024 to get some insights on work underway in vaccines programs targeting avian influenza (AI) internationally.“Avian flu has been problematic for the past few years, with outbreaks escalating in 2020 and 2021, and we see that the virus continues to evolve," she said.The global spread of the virus persists with little indication of abating. Formerly limited to seasonal outbreaks, bird flu now maintains a year-round presence, leading to extensive bird culling, observed the expert. “That is a concern for the scientific community."She emphasized the need for an evolution in risk management strategies given that heightened level of virulence.And a WOAH conference last year​​ heard that tackling the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus now requires the dedication of international and regional organizations, different administrations and all sectors and stakeholders; delegates were told that there is a need to work on guidelines on vaccination at multiple tier levels, for countries that are not exporting but also for countries that do export and countries that import. In May, the global organization advocated​​ for the use of vaccination against the virus.Boehringer's approach to risk management involves providing support to both the industry and governments in multiple countries, including the offer of expertise in veterinary care and biosecurity, along with supplying vaccines for trials. Garcia explained that these efforts aim to assist national authorities in determining the most effective approach to controlling the virus.Governments want to be able to demonstrate locally that they have crisis management plans in place, that they are controlling bird flu outbreaks, and that they want to try and avoid mass depopulation of birds, said Garcia. “It is not just about the economic losses; culling has huge emotional impact on farmers.”Continuing, she emphasized that vaccination alone is not sufficient to control the virus. A comprehensive approach, encompassing biosecurity measures, vaccination programs, and robust surveillance, is crucial. Stressing the importance of a three-pronged strategy, she highlighted that governments must decide on the implementation of all three elements to effectively curb the spread of the disease.Vaccination campaigns To date, mass AI vaccination campaigns have been implemented in China, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Mexico authorized emergency vaccinations against the H5N1 bird flu strain last year. The country is currently using two vaccines​​, one of which is supplied by Boehringer. Several countries in Latin America have already rolled-out vaccination programs, with Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador also purchasing the same vaccines used by Mexico.The US is advanced in terms of its biosecurity approach, said Garcia, and the country is testing an array of vaccines against AI. “However, it has not yet decided on whether to go ahead with a vaccine program.” The US is concerned about the potential poultry trade implications of doing so. EU strategies In May 2023, EU's 27 member states instigated an avian flu vaccine strategy, with various members states, outlined Garcia, initiating vaccine research trials in this respect.France launched a tender in April 2023 for 80 million doses of bird flu vaccines to be ready to start its vaccination program in the autumn. In July, the government announced it has chosen Boehringer to supply those doses and, in October last year, France began vaccinating ducks against AI to try and stem the virus, the first country in the EU to do so. Garcia told us the German firm was picked as the exclusive supplier over French supplier, Ceva Animal Health, on cost, dosage supply capacity and cold-chain storage conditions.All indications are that vaccination programs against bird flu in France will become routine, she believes. “France has already published a second tender, for which we have reapplied.”France is waiting for Italy and the Netherlands to release the results of their vaccine research programs in turkeys and layers, respectively, to determine its next step in relation to potentially broadening out its vaccine strategy, said the Boehringer representative.“Italy and the Netherlands are testing a range of vaccines including ours.”Turkeys as a species are extremely susceptive to bird flu, she added.

Michigan is one of them. By: Dr. Partha Nandi Posted and last updated (WXYZ) — In today’s Health Alert, the flu may have peaked nationally, but certain areas are still experiencing high or very high levels. Twenty-three states reported high levels of respiratory illnesses, an increase from eighteen states the week prior. Michigan is one of them. The CDC’s Flu Activity Map shows that Michigan’s activity level is currently Moderate. Now, flu activity in our state appeared to have peaked back in late December. We saw numbers decline, that is, until late January. That’s when numbers started to climb again. Apparently, the flu was not done with Michiganders. According to the Michigan Disease Surveillance System’s report for the week ending February 10th, the state recorded 2,533 Influenza cases, up from 2,009 the week prior.Now, there are four types of influenza viruses: A, B, C, and D. Laboratory data shows that the virus taking up the lion’s share in Michigan is Influenza A. The most common strain is H1N1, followed by H3N2 and then Influenza B.In my opinion, it’s a very good idea to get the flu shot, especially when influenza viruses are circulating. Getting vaccinated can still offer benefits like reducing the risk of flu illnesses, hospitalizations, and even death.So far, the US has seen around 22 million illnesses, 250,000 hospitalizations, and 15,000 deaths from the flu this season, according to CDC estimates. Of those deaths, 74 were children. Unfortunately, children under the age of 5 are at a higher risk of flu complications. As are our older folks, those aged 65 and up, pregnant women, and people with chronic disease or weakened immune systems.If you feel sick with symptoms like fever, muscle aches, headache, and fatigue, please consider getting tested. If it turns out you have the flu, there are antiviral medications available. Starting them early, within 1-2 days of symptoms, works best. They can ease symptoms and shorten the time you're sick, and studies have shown that early treatment can reduce the risk of death.Now, the CDC advises that people aged six months and older get a yearly flu vaccine, which I completely support. Getting vaccinated is the best way to protect not only yourself but also your loved ones. So, once again, it's not too late in the season to get a flu shot. Copyright 2024 Scripps Media, Inc.

Flag Requests Academy Nominations Meeting Request Internships Whistleblowers Resources For Veterans Agriculture Resources Priorities News Press Releases Columns Videos Contact Hear From Joni Email Joni Office Locations Website Search Open Submit Site Search Query Website Search Senator Ernst Facebook Senator Ernst Twitter Senator Ernst Instagram Senator Ernst Youtube Home Logo Link News Press Releases Published: February 15, 2024 Ernst Demands Answers for “Fowl” Play Biden’s USDA Funding Risky CCP-affiliated Avian Research WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) is demanding answers to why the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) is funding a collaboration with a Chinese Communist Party (CCP)-linked researcher involving dangerous bird flu experiments. She pointed out a researcher involved with these experiments is affiliated with China’s infamous Wuhan Institute of Virology, from where the COVID-19 pandemic is believed to have leaked. Like the dangerous experiments on coronaviruses conducted in unsafe labs in Wuhan, this collaboration will involve a form of gain?of?function research that could make the virus more infectious. With Iowa being the nation’s leading egg producer and experiencing devastating poultry losses this past year due to avian flu, avian flu research and prevention is a personal priority for Ernst. She believes those efforts, however, should not involve the forced mutation of a virus to become more deadly, especially in unsafe Chinese labs that do not adhere to the absolute highest safety standards. In a letter to Secretary Tom Vilsack, Ernst wrote, “I am writing to obtain information about the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s ongoing funding of a collaboration with a Chinese Communist Party-linked researcher involving dangerous bird flu experiments and recent support for other animal labs in adversarial nations. I was troubled to learn from the non-profit group White Coat Waste Project that USDA is supporting experiments involving “a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus” that poses a “risk to both animals and humans” in collaboration with the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), which is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party, and a researcher affiliated with the infamous Wuhan Institute of Virology. The Biden USDA began financing the collaboration for “wet-lab virology” to study “newly emerging avian influenza viruses” in April 2021. The project has already received at least $1 million of U.S. taxpayers’ money to date and is slated to be funded through 2026.” “USDA serves a vital role detecting and preventing avian influenza. Not just in Iowa, but around the world since diseases do not know or respect international boundaries. While this may require partnering with global competitors and even adversarial nations, we must never compromise public health standards in these efforts,” she continued. She requested answers to get to the bottom of the full extent taxpayer dollars are being used for risky research connected to our adversaries and the health safety risk it poses. “It's reckless and indefensible for bird-brained USDA bureaucrats to bankroll dangerous avian flu gain-of-function studies involving virus experimenters from the notorious Wuhan animal lab that likely caused COVID and its CCP-run parent organization, the Chinese Academy of Sciences,” said Justin Goodman, Senior Vice President, White Coat Waste Project. “After the disaster that WCW exposed in Wuhan, taxpayers shouldn’t be forced to foot the bill for animal experiments with foreign adversaries that soup up viruses and can cause pandemics or create bioweapons. We’re grateful for Sen. Ernst’s ongoing leadership in efforts to fight USDA’s reckless spending, and we’re urging Congress to use the forthcoming Farm Bill to ensure the USDA does not ship another red cent of taxpayers’ money to unaccountable animal labs in China, Russia and other hostile nations. The solution is simple: Stop the money. Stop the madness!” Read the full letter here. Background: Last year, Ernst introduced the TRACKS Act to bring badly needed transparency to how federal dollars are spent, hold the government accountable, and help prevent taxpayers from supporting our adversaries.

Their review covered two main panzootic periods – 2003 to 2019 and the ongoing 2020 through 2023 – and elucidates the trends in H5N1 infections during these periods. Their findings suggest that while the primary source of viral transmission remains contact with infected birds, mammal-to-mammal transmissions are on the rise. These alarming findings highlight recent mutations in H5N1 strains, underscoring the need for continuous surveillance to mitigate a potential global pandemic. Synopsis: Recent Changes in Patterns of Mammal Infection with Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza A(H5N1) Virus Worldwide. Image Credit: Jeremy Richards / Shutterstock Avian influenza in mammals? Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) is a severe viral disease caused by subtypes (H5 and H7) of type A. Over the last century, these viruses have caused repeated endemic waves, spreading rapidly and causing substantial losses of avian fauna across a wide range of species, especially human-reared poultry. Since 2003, however, HPAI A (H5N1) has been observed to breach kingdom barriers and jump from their avian hosts to mammals, resulting in two unpreceded panzootic events – 2003 to 2019 and the ongoing 2020 through 2023 period. These events have triggered alarm bells within the scientific community due to mutant H1N5 strains affecting endangered wildlife, the economic losses associated with their infecting livestock, and their potential for human transmission. Limited reports on the ongoing panzootic period suggest that it is significantly more severe than the 2003 one. It is projected to be one of the worst panzootic events in recorded history across economic, geographic coverage, and animal morbidity and mortality scales. In the three years since the advent of the panzootic, the virus has spread across four continents and a record 26 countries, notably infecting minks, foxes, ferrets, seals, and domestic cats, all of which present the potential for human transmission. Unfortunately, research on H1N5 and the ongoing panzootic remains scarce and restricted to ‘gray literature’ (non-peer-reviewed records and reports from government databases and websites). Understanding the evolution of the H5N1 virus and the mutations allowing emergent strains to far outdo their ancestral virus in infectivity and species spread would better equip policymakers and scientists alike with the information required to attenuate the ongoing panzootic before it explodes into a full-fledged pandemic. Characteristics of mammal species affected worldwide by highly pathogenic influenza virus A (H5N1) the current panzootic (2020–2023). A) Habitat of mammal species affected by H5N1. B) Phylogeny of mammal species affected (tree constructed using iTOL version 5 following Letunic and Bork, from DNA sequence data available in Upham et al.). C) Trophic level (facultative scavenger, carnivore, omnivore, or herbivore) of mammal species affected worldwide by H5N1. Some of the omnivorous and carnivorous mammals included in the pyramid (n = 13) also consume carrion; thus, they are also considered to be facultative scavengers and are incorporated in the upper part of the pyramid. About the study In the present review, researchers compiled and analyzed scientific literature on natural mammalian H5N1 infections (including humans) and compared findings from the current panzootic to those from previous H5N1 waves. The review focuses on the number and habitats of infected species, their phylogeny, infection sources, and necropsy findings. They further investigate the viral mutations that enable cross-species transmission and elucidate potential risks to biodiversity and human health.

Studies based on serologic evidence were excluded from analyses due to uncertainty on the time of infection, which may bias diagnostic results. Additionally, the World Organisation for Animal Health, the United Kingdom’s Animal and Plant Health Agency, and the United States of America (US) Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Service were queried for up-to-date information on the current panzootic. Data from the World Health Organization (WHO) was collated for information on human infections. Finally, conservation statuses of infected species were derived from the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species, their diets and habitats from MammalBase, and H5N1 sequence data from Upham et al. (2019). Study findings The database literature review revealed 59 publications on mammalian H5N1 infections, 23 of which discussed previous H5N1 waves and 36 on the ongoing panzootic. Scientific interest in the ongoing panzootic is immediately evident – more mammalian infection data has been generated in the last three years than was generated in the preceding 23. Alarmingly, while previous waves combined reported 10 infected countries spread across three continents (Asia, Europe, and Africa), the ongoing panzootic has already spread to 26 countries across Europe, South America, North America, and Asia. Limited testing and reporting from other nations suggests that these findings are underestimations. “Our review suggests that H5N1 virus is expanding its geographic range to new continents such as North and South America. This fact is of concern because when an emerging pathogen reaches naive populations, the consequences for biodiversity can be catastrophic, especially for threatened species.” Investigations into the number of species affected reveal that while previous panzootics cumulatively infected nine predominantly terrestrial and semi-aquatic species, the current panzootic has already been detected in more than 48 mammalian species, including 13 species of marine mammals. Peru, Chile, and Argentina have reported thousands of dead individuals of seals and similar mammals (e.g., the American sea lion [Otaria flavescens]), almost resulting in localized extinction events. Costs to biodiversity are critical – thus far, avian influenza has affected four near-threatened, four endangered, three vulnerable, and one critically endangered species as compared to previous panzootics, which cumulatively infected two endangered and two vulnerable species. Similarities to previous pandemics do exist – most affected mammals are carnivores (mainly apex- and mesopredators) and scavengers, corresponding to the most likely infection sources – close contact (including ingestion) with dead or dying birds or infected carrion. …in the year 2004, a total of 147 tigers and 2 leopards housed in zoos in Thailand became infected and died after consuming infected chicken carcasses. In the current panzootic, the first case of H5N1infection in minks in Spain was probably caused by contact with infected birds (perhaps gulls).” At least five publications have reported an alarming trend in viral adaptation – H5N1 strains with novel mutations that may allow for mammal-to-mammal transmission have been identified. If these strains spread, models suggest that a global pandemic may occur rapidly, causing unprecedented biodiversity and economic loss. Finally, H5N1 has been found to have spilled over and infected at least 878 humans and resulted in 458 deaths (52% lethality) with close contact with livestock (especially poultry) deemed the main transmission route. “So far, no evidence indicates human-to-human transmission, and the risk for a pandemic event still seems low. However, one of the most severe influenza viruses to have affected humans (i.e., Spanish influenza [1918–1919]) developed from an avian influenza virus that adapted to humans, a fact that should be considered when assessing the spillover risk. Governments must assume responsibility for protecting biodiversity and human health from diseases caused by human activities. If we hope to conserve biodiversity and protect human health, we must change the way we produce our food (poultry farming, in this specific case) and how we interact with and affect wildlife.” Journal reference: Plaza PI, Gamarra-Toledo V, Rodríguez Euguí J, Lambertucci SA.

Here, we generate a plasmid DNA mix vaccine that encodes protein heterodimers with sixteen different influenza A virus hemagglutinins (HA) representing all HA subtypes except H1 (group 1) and H7 (group 2). Each single heterodimer expresses two different HA subtypes and is targeted to MHC class II on antigen presenting cells (APC). Female mice immunized with the plasmid mix produce antibodies not only against the 16 HA subtypes, but also against non-included H1 and H7. We demonstrate that individual antibody molecules cross-react between different HAs. Furthermore, the mix vaccine induces T cell responses to conserved HA epitopes. Immunized mice are partially protected against H1 viruses. The results show that application of valency-based immuno-selection to diversified antigens can be used to direct antibody responses towards conserved (subdominant) epitopes on viral antigens.

Moreover, IAVs have caused four pandemics during the last century alone3. The main target for neutralizing antibodies against IAVs is viral surface glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA)4. There are 18 different HA subtypes5,6,7,8. Based on similarities in amino acid sequences, these 18 subtypes are divided into group 1 (H1, H2, H5, H6, H8, H9, H11, H12, H13, H16, H17 and H18), and group 2 (H3, H4, H7, H10, H14 and H15). At present, H1 and H3 viruses circulate in the human population and regularly cause seasonal epidemics. In addition, a number of zoonotic IAV (H5, H6, H7, H9 and H10) have caused isolated but severe disease outbreaks in humans9.The adaptive immune system often responds to antigen in a hierarchical manner; highly immunogenic epitopes are immunodominant, while less immunogenic epitopes are subdominant10. Current influenza vaccines predominantly elicit antibodies towards immunodominant epitopes in the membrane-distal head domain of HA. Unfortunately, frequent mutations in the HA head allow viral escape from pre-existing immune responses11,12,13, necessitating annual reformulations of seasonal influenza vaccines14. It is therefore important to develop vaccine formats that focus B cell responses towards conserved, subdominant HA epitopes, thus enhancing the generation of broadly cross-reactive antibodies.Human monoclonal antibodies with broad reactivity to many HAs have been isolated15, suggesting that it should be possible to induce broadly reactive antibodies to subdominant HA epitopes by means of innovative vaccination strategies. The main specificities of broadly neutralizing antibodies are the receptor binding site in the HA head domain16,17,18, and epitopes in the fusion peptide in the conserved stem domain19,20,21.We have recently developed a new vaccine format based on an ACID/BASE-modified Fos-Jun zipper where bivalency versus monovalency of vaccine antigens can be controlled22. Using this strategy, we have shown that antigen bivalency enhances the ability of APC-targeted vaccines to induce potent antibody responses23. As an explanation, we hypothesized that antigen bivalency increased B cell stimulation by cross-linking B cell receptors (BCRs) in APC-B cell synapses. According to this hypothesis, if two variants of an antigen are expressed together in a heterodimer, B cells with specificity for conserved epitopes shared by the two variants should be preferentially stimulated23. To test this idea, we here developed a vaccine strategy where single vaccine protein heterodimers should always express two different HA subtypes (e.g. HAx, and HAy), each in a monovalent manner. In such molecules, only conserved epitopes shared between HAx and HAy should be bivalent while strain-specific HA epitopes should be monovalent. This vaccination strategy should preferentially stimulate B cells (antibodies) with specificity for conserved epitopes, while monovalent strain-specific epitopes should be less immunogenic. To test if such a valency-based immuno-selection strategy could enhance induction of broadly reactive antibody responses against ordinarily subdominant HA epitopes, we have here immunized mice with mixtures of plasmids that together encoded up to 18 different HA subtypes, each HA being monovalently expressed in a large number of heterodimeric vaccine molecules.ResultsAPC-targeted heterodimeric proteins with different HAs delivered as DNA plasmidsWe selected HA variants from 18 IAV subtypes based on their commercial availability as proteins and their similarity to strains that presently circulate or have circulated in the past (Table 1). A phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1a) of selected HA subtypes was generated based on their amino acid sequences (Supplementary Fig. 1). We inserted genes for the 18 HA subtypes into A and B plasmids that together encode heterodimeric vaccine proteins due to a centrally located modified Fos-Jun zipper heterodimerization motif called A/B (ACID/BASE) (Fig. 1b)22,24. The different HA subtypes were expressed C-terminally of the dimerization unit. To bivalently target proteins to APC, A and B chains both expressed an N-terminal MHCII (I-Ed)-specific scFv. In non-targeted controls a scFv specific for the hapten 4-hydroxy-3-iodo-5-nitrophenylacetic acid (NIP) replaced the MHCII-specific scFv.Table 1 Overview of IAV HA subtype virus strains used in the plasmid mix vaccines, ELISA coats and challenge of miceFull size tableFig. 1: Expression of 18 different HA subtypes in heterodimeric vaccine proteins.a Phylogenetic tree of amino acid sequences of selected HA subtypes of group 1 (black) and group 2 (gray). Scale bar represents 10% variation in amino acid sequences. b Schematic representation of heterodimeric vaccine proteins (middle) and the units each chain is composed of (left). The dimerization unit contains either a duplicated ACID (A) or BASE (B) sequence of a modified Fos-Jun zipper, attached to a shortened Ig hinge that allows formation of covalent bonds. The targeting unit is either scFv of anti-MHCII (I-Ed) mAb (scFvαMHCII), or scFv of anti-NIP mAb (scFvαNIP). The antigenic unit is any HA from subtypes H1-18 of IAV. Right: The A and the B cassette plasmids encoding the A and B chain of a heterodimer. c, d HEK293E cells were transiently co-transfected with indicated pairs of A and B plasmids that together encode heterodimers with two identical MHCII-specific targeting units and two identical HA antigenic units (HAx/HAx), for each of H1-18. Supernatants were analyzed by: (c) Western blot under non-reducing conditions, detected with anti-A/B mAb (n = 1 experiment); (d) sandwich ELISA employing anti-A/B and anti-HA stem mAb. e HEK293E cells were co-transfected with A and B plasmids that encode heterodimers with HA expression on the A and B arms as indicated (HA on A chain is indicated before the slash, followed by HA on the B chain). Left: pairing of plasmids with an HA corresponding to each of H1-18 (scFvαMHCII-A-H1-18) and an invariant B plasmid (scFvαNIP-B-H1) resulting in HAx/H1 heterodimers. Right: vice versa, resulting in H1/HAx heterodimers. Supernatants were analyzed by sandwich ELISA using mAbs specific for A/B and H1. Shown are individual OD405nm values plus mean of technical triplicates ± SD. (n = 1 experiment). Statistics were calculated for vaccine protein expression compared to mock, using one-way Anova with Dunnetts multiple comparisons. All heterodimeric proteins in (d) and (e) were expressed in significantly higher amounts then the mock with p < 0.0001. Amino acid sequences for included HA proteins in (a) and uncropped images for Western blots in (c) are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageWe first tested if all 18 HA subtypes were properly expressed in heterodimeric proteins. HEK293E cells were co-transfected with plasmid pairs that together encoded MHCII-targeted heterodimers with identical HA on their two antigenic arms. Heterodimers could be detected in supernatant by Western blot with a mAb specific for the assembled A/B heterodimerization motif (Fig. 1c), and by ELISA using a combination of mAbs against A/B and a conserved HA stem epitope (Fig. 1d). We verified the secretion of each of the 18 HA subtypes on either A or B chains by co-transfection of A plasmids expressing any of H1-18 together with B plasmids expressing H1, and vice versa. We detected similar levels of heterodimeric proteins with all MHCII-targeted plasmid combinations (Fig. 1e). The results were confirmed for non-targeted scFvαNIP plasmid combinations (Supplementary Fig. 2). Expression of scFvαMHCII and scFvαNIP, on either A or B chains, did not influence the results (Fig. 1e, Supplementary Fig. 2). These findings suggest that A and B chains were assembled and secreted as correctly folded heterodimeric vaccine proteins with any of the 18 HA subtypes as antigen.MHCII-targeted heterodimeric DNA vaccines that bivalently express two identical HA (H1-18) induce subtype-specific antibody responsesBALB/c mice were vaccinated once with A/B plasmid pairs that encode MHCII-targeted heterodimers with identical HA on their two arms (i.e. bivalent expression). Plasmids were injected intradermally (i.d.) followed by electroporation (EP) to increase cellular uptake of DNA. Six weeks after vaccination, serum IgG reactivity was clearly highest against the HA subtype expressed in the vaccine (Fig. 2a). Some minor cross-reactivity was observed towards phylogenetically related HA subtypes. While most of the 18 HA subtypes induced high antibody titers, H2 and H5 were less immunogenic. The observed IgG titers correlated to the expression levels of bivalent HA vaccines (Supplementary Fig. 3). These results suggest that all 18 bivalently expressed HA subtypes are immunogenic in heterodimeric vaccine molecules.Fig. 2: MHCII-targeted heterodimeric DNA vaccines that bivalently express two identical HA induce subtype-specific antibody responses.a Female BALB/cAnNRj mice (n = 4/group) were vaccinated i.d. with a total of 50 µg DNA (A and B plasmids) immediately followed by electroporation (EP). Plasmids encoded bivalent heterodimers with two scFvαMHCII and two identical HAs for H1-18. HA subtype-specific IgG responses elicited by a given HAx/HAx (indicated left) were analyzed six weeks after vaccination against the indicated recombinant HA (top) in ELISAs. Top matrix: group 1 HAs. Bottom matrix: group 2 HAs. Scale for heat map is indicated. b–d BALB/c mice vaccinated with indicated bivalent group 1 HAs (25 µg/plasmid, n = 4/group), or with scFVαMHCII-targeted H1/H1 (n = 7) or NaCl (n = 7) as controls, were challenged with 5xLD50 PR8 (H1N1) virus ten weeks after vaccination. e Mice vaccinated with indicated bivalent group 2 HAs (25 µg/plasmid, n = 4/group), or with scFVαMHCII-targeted H7/H7 (n = 4) or NaCl (n = 4) as controls, were challenged with 5xLD50 Aurkey/Italy/3889/1999 virus (H7N1). Shown are mean weight ± SEM). Mice were euthanized when they reached ≤ 80% of their original body weight and removed from the weight curves. % survival is shown in Supplementary Fig. 4. (n = 1 experiment). The same NaCl and H1/H1 vaccinated control mice were used in (b–d). For survival after PR8 challenge, significance was calculated on day 6 (b–d) or day 4 (e) for indicated groups compared to H1/H1 or H7/H7 control vaccines using one-way ANOVA with Dunnet’s multiple comparisons test. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageTen weeks after a single immunization with the various group 1 HA, mice were challenged with influenza H1N1 PR8 virus (Fig. 2b–d and Supplementary Fig. 4a–c). Vaccines expressing homologous MHCII-targeted H1/H1 from PR8 completely protected mice against PR8 virus, consistent with previous results25. Vaccines expressing other HA subtypes within group 1 generally failed to protect against PR8. The minor protection induced by H11, H12, and H13 could be due to T cell cross-reactivity since the antibody responses elicited by these HA subtypes poorly cross-reacted to H1 (Fig. 2a). Mice vaccinated with group 2 HA subtypes were challenged ten weeks later with H7N1 virus (Aurkey/Italy/3889/1999) (Fig. 2e and Supplementary Fig. 4d). The MHCII-targeted vaccine expressing H7/H7 (A/chicken/Italy/13474/1999 H7N1) protected against this heterologous virus strain, while vaccines with other group 2 HA subtypes did not. Overall, to obtain full vaccine-induced protection with these antigenically bivalent vaccines, the HA subtype had to match the subtype of challenging virus.Different HA subtypes can be combined in one heterodimeric mix vaccineWe have previously shown that antigen bivalency in dimeric vaccines increases humoral responses23. Heterodimers that carry two different HA subtypes are bivalent for conserved epitopes while monovalent for unique epitopes, as illustrated in Fig. 3a. We therefore hypothesized that forced monovalency for HA subtypes in dimeric vaccine molecules could selectively favor activation of B cells reactive towards shared conserved regions over those specific for unique epitopes on HA subtypes.Fig. 3: The mix plasmid vaccines are translated into vaccine proteins in vitro and induce HA subtype-specific antibody responses upon immunization of mice.a Co-transfection of nine A plasmids and nine B plasmids expressing the indicated 18 HA subtypes should theoretically yield 81 heterodimeric proteins. Each heterodimer should be monovalent for any HA subtype. b The 18 HA subtypes of group 1 and group 2 were distributed on either A or B plasmids, as indicated. In 16 HA subtype mixes, H1 and H7 (colored lightly) were excluded. c HEK293E cells were transiently co-transfected with the 18 HA subtype plasmid mixes (group 1 + 2, either with scFvαMHCII or scFvαNIP) and supernatants were analyzed in sandwich ELISA with the indicated coat and detection mAbs. A/B plasmid pairs expressing bivalent HA subtypes (H1/H1, H7/H7, H3/H3) or bivalent scFv from M315 myeloma protein (scFv315/scFv315) were included as controls. Shown are mean ± SD of technical triplicates. d Female BALB/cAnNRj mice were immunized three times i.d./EP (week 0, 5, 10) with the 16 HA subtype mix (1 µg/plasmid), in either APC-targeted (scFvαMHCII) or non-targeted (scFvαNIP) format. Serum collected at weeks 5, 7, and 12 were analyzed by ELISA for IgG antibodies against the indicated HA subtypes encoded within the HA mix vaccine. Shown are mean IgG titers ± SEM, n = 6 mice/group. (n = 1 experiment). Statistics in (c) were calculated for vaccine protein expression compared to scFv315/scFv315, H3/H3, H1/H1 or H7/H7 negative controls on 1x dilution of supernatant, n.s. = not significant, one-way Anova with Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test. There were no statistical differences between targeted and non-targeted groups in (d) (two-tailed Mann–Whitney for each timepoint). Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageTo test our hypothesis, we expressed nine HA subtypes with A plasmids, and the residual nine subtypes with B plasmids, equally splitting both group 1 and 2 HAs (Fig. 3b). Theoretically, 81 HA monovalent heterodimers should be formed. To test if plasmid mixtures were translated into anticipated vaccine proteins, HEK293E cells were transiently co-transfected with a mixture of the nine A plus the nine B plasmids. For both MHCII-targeted and NIP-targeted mixes, we detected heterodimers in sandwich ELISAs using either H1- and H3-specific mAbs or a broadly reactive anti-HA stem mAb in combination with the anti-A/B mAb, suggesting formation of heterodimeric vaccine proteins (Fig. 3c). When capturing with an anti-H1 mAb, dimers were detected with anti-stem and anti-H3 mAbs but not with the same anti-H1 mAb as used for capture, demonstrating formation of H1/H3 but not H1/H1 heterodimers. This result indicates a lack of heterodimers expressing two identical HA. Non-targeted heterodimers were secreted more efficiently than MHCII-targeted versions, consistent with previous observations25,26.A heterodimeric HA mix vaccine induces antibody responses against HAs included in the mixTo test the immunogenicity of the mix vaccines, we prepared mixes of 16 HA subtypes as described in Fig. 3a, but leaving out H1 (group 1) and H7 (group 2), resulting in 64 possible heterodimers. We hypothesized that a high vaccine dose might favor induction of strain-specific rather than cross-reactive antibody responses. We therefore performed an initial titration of mix vaccines which showed that vaccination with 1 µg/plasmid induced only low amounts of strain-specific antibody responses for all HA subtypes after one immunization (Supplementary Fig. 5). We therefore selected this dose for further experiments. Mice were immunized i.d. three times with either an MHCII-targeted or a non-targeted version of the DNA mix vaccine. Five weeks after the first immunization, IgG responses were observed against each of the tested HA variants included in the plasmid mix (Fig. 3d). However, the antibody titers were generally lower than those obtained after a single vaccination with plasmids encoding MHCII-targeted heterodimers with bivalent HA expression (Fig. 2a). This could be due to a lack of bivalency, lower amounts of a given HA in the mix, or both. After two boosts, antibody levels increased and reached titers of approximately 104 (Fig. 3d). No differences between the MHCII-targeted and non-targeted mixes were observed. This result is consistent with the observation that the APC-targeting effect observed with bivalent antigen expression25,26,27,28,29 is less evident when antigen is monovalent23. Similar results were obtained after intramuscular (i.m.)/EP immunizations (Supplementary Fig. 6). Note that the HA-reactive antibodies detected in these experiments could be either cross-reactive or subtype-specific.Vaccination with DNA plasmid and protein mixes induces antibodies against HA subtypes not included in the mixTo test whether the mix vaccine induces cross-reactive antibodies, mice were vaccinated i.d. with DNA mix vaccines that contained either 16 HAs (ΔH1ΔH7) or all 18 subtypes. IgG titers against H1 and H7 were low after a single immunization but increased after two boosts (Fig. 4a). Interestingly, the inclusion of H1 and H7 in the mix did not improve antibody responses against H1 and H7. This is to be expected since a strong anti-H1 response requires bivalency23. MHCII-targeting did not significantly enhance the levels of H1- and H7-reactive IgG.Fig. 4: Vaccination with an HA plasmid mix induces antibodies against HA subtypes not included in the mix.a Female BALB/cAnNRj mice were immunized three times (arrows) intradermally (i.d.)/EP with indicated plasmid mixes (1 µg DNA/plasmid) that encoded either 16 (H1 and H7 excluded, n = 6) or 18 (n = 5) HA subtypes in either APC-targeted (scFvαMHCII) or non-targeted (scFvαNIP) formats. Positive controls were scFvαMHCII-targeted H1/H1 and H7/H7 bivalent vaccines (5 µg/plasmid, n = 4/group). Shown are H1- and H7-reactive serum IgG titers at indicated timepoints. b Mice were immunized three times (arrows) intramuscularly (i.m.)/EP with indicated mixes (1 µg DNA/plasmid, n = 7 [scFvαNIP-group1 + 2(ΔH1ΔH7)] or n = 9 [scFvαMHCII-group1 + 2(ΔH1ΔH7)]) or with scFvαMHCII-H1/H1 or scFvαMHCII-H7/H7 (5 µg/plasmid, n = 3/group) or NaCl (n = 9) controls. Shown are H1- or H7-reactive serum IgG titers at indicated timepoints. c, d Mice were vaccinated as in (b) with the indicated mix vaccines (n = 6 [scFvαNIP-group1 + 2(ΔH1ΔH7)] or n = 9 [scFvαMHCII-group1 + 2(ΔH1ΔH7)]), or with scFvαMHCII-H1/H1 (n = 3), scFvαMHCII-H7/H7 (n = 4) or NaCl (n = 10) controls. Shown are H1- and H7-reactive serum IgG1 and IgG2a (c) and IgG binding to inactivated H1N1 virus as ELSIA coat antigen (d) at week 11. e–f Mice were vaccinated as in (b) (n = 8 [mix vaccines and NaCl] or n = 4 [bivalent H1/H1 or H7/H7 control]). In vitro neutralization of PR8 virus infection of MDCK cells by week 11 sera was measured. Shown are 50% neutralizing serum titers (e). H1PR8-specific ADCC by week 11 sera was determined by measuring in vitro activation of mouse NK cells (f). g Mice were immunized twice (arrows) with purified scFvαMHCII-targeted ΔH1ΔH7 mix protein vaccine or scFvαMHCII-H1/H1 protein vaccine as control (2.5 µg protein with/without AddaVax adjuvant, n = 4/group). Shown is H1-reactive total serum IgG at indicated timepoints. Mean ± SEM (a, b, and g) or titers/percentages for individual mice plus mean ± SEM (c–f) are indicated. Responses of mix vaccines (calculated for final timepoints in (a), (b), and (g)) were statistically compared to NaCl or PBS with adjuvant. In c and d, responses elicited by targeted and non-targeted vaccines were also compared. Kruskal-Wallis with Dunn’s multiple comparisons test. N.D. = non-detectable. n = 1 independent experiment, except one of three for (b). Source Data file is provided.Full size imageWe obtained similar results after i.m. immunization (Fig. 4b). Here, MHCII-targeting slightly enhanced antibody responses against H1 but not H7 (Fig. 4b–d). The cross-reactive antibodies were of both IgG1 and IgG2a subclasses (Fig. 4c). Plasmid mix vaccines also induced antibodies reactive to HA of another H1 strain, A/California/07/2009 (Cal07) (Supplementary Fig. 7). The H1-reactive antibodies bound inactivated H1N1 PR8 virus in ELISA, indicating that the epitopes bound by cross-reactive antibodies are expressed on viral particles (Fig. 4d). These results were essentially confirmed in experiments using separate mixes for group 1 and group 2 HA (Supplementary Fig. 8). Serum antibodies induced by the mix showed no detectable virus neutralization activity against PR8 H1N1 virus (Fig. 4e and Supplementary Fig. 9a), nor against Cal07 H1N1, H3N2 (A/HongKong/1/1968) or H7N1 (Aurkey/Italy/3889/1999) virus (Supplementary Fig. 9a). To explore the ability of vaccine-induced antibodies to engage in Fc-mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), we tested whether induced H1-reactive antibodies could activate mouse NK cells. Mice immunized with the MHCII-targeted (ΔH1ΔH7) mix vaccine induced H1-reactive serum antibodies that enhanced levels of IFN-γ+ and CD107a+ NK cells compared to the NaCl and H7/H7 control-vaccinated mice (Fig. 4f and Supplementary Fig. 9b, c). Taken together, immunizations with plasmid mixes encoding most HA subtypes, monovalently expressed in heterodimeric vaccine proteins, induce cross-reactive antibodies against non-included HA.The induction of cross-reactive antibodies using MHCII-targeted plasmid mixes was extended to use of a mix of purified heterodimeric proteins (Supplementary Fig. 10a, b). The heterodimeric mix of 16 HA in combination with AddaVax adjuvant induced IgG antibodies against non-included H1 (Fig. 4g). The H1-reactive antibodies were of both IgG1 and IgG2a subtypes (Supplementary Fig. 10c). In the absence of adjuvant, the MHCII-targeted mix proteins induced some anti-H1 IgG1, but not IgG2a. This result supports the idea that immunization with a plasmid mix vaccine induces transfected cells to secrete a protein mix vaccine that elicits antibody responses.Mix plasmid vaccines induce antibodies that cross-react between closely related HATo directly analyze HA cross-reactivity of antibodies induced by the ΔH1ΔH7 16 HA plasmid mix, we performed inhibition ELISAs. Sera of vaccinated mice were pre-incubated with various recombinant HAs before adding the samples to wells coated with H1 or H7 (Fig. 5a, b). In such inhibition assays, a reduced signal in the presence of a competitor indicates that single antibody molecules bind both the coat HA and the competing HA. Binding to H1 was inhibited more effectively by group 1 HAs as compared to group 2 HAs. Moreover, the level of inhibition was most pronounced for group 1 HAs with the highest sequence homology to H1 (H2, H5, H6) (Fig. 5a, Supplementary Fig. 11). In contrast, in bivalent H1/H1-vaccinated mice, serum antibodies binding to H1 coat could only be inhibited by soluble H1 and no other HAs. (Fig. 5a). The inhibition pattern was not influenced by the inclusion of H1 and H7, nor by APC-targeting versus non-targeting.Fig. 5: Vaccination with HA plasmid mixes induces serum antibodies that cross-react between HA subtypes.a, f Female BALB/cAnNRj mice were vaccinated thrice (week 0, 5 and 9) i.m./EP with plasmid mixes encoding the indicated mix vaccines (1 µg DNA/plasmid, n = 8/group). Positive controls were vaccinated with either bivalent H1/H1, H7/H7, H2/H2, H3/H3, or H5/H5, all scFvαMHCII-targeted (5 µg DNA/plasmid, n = 4/group). Sera were harvested two weeks after the final vaccination and pooled for each experimental group. a–e Pooled sera were pre-incubated with the indicated soluble competing HA proteins (5 µg/ml, x-axis) prior to testing for binding to coat HAs in ELISA. Heatmaps show mean % inhibition of technical triplicates. f H1-reactive antibodies were affinity-purified on H1PR8-conjugated Sepharose. Purified antibodies were analyzed for binding to the indicated recombinant HA proteins in ELISA. Heatmap shows mean IgG titer of technical triplicates. Each panel presents data derived from n = 1 independent experiment. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageUsing H7 as a coat antigen, serum antibodies from mix-vaccinated mice were only inhibited from binding to H7 coat by H15 (~78% homology), but not by H3, H4 or H14 (each ~50% homology) (Fig. 5b, Supplementary Fig. 11). Antibodies induced by a bivalent H7/H7 vaccine had a different specificity since binding to H7 coat was only inhibited by H7 and not H15. Again, the inclusion of H1 and H7 in the mix, or APC-targeting versus non-targeting, did not influence induction of cross-reactive antibodies binding H7.We extended the studies to HAs included in the mixes. Results with two group 1 HAs, H2 and H5, were similar to that described above for H1 (Fig. 5c, d) since HAs of closest homology inhibited the best, and APC-targeting or not did not influence the results. Using group 2 H3 as coat, we only observed effective inhibition with H3 and only weak inhibition with the other HAs (Fig. 5e).To confirm the results of the inhibition ELISA, we used H1PR8 Sepharose beads to purify H1-reactive antibodies from pooled sera of vaccinated mice. Purified H1-reactive antibodies from mix-vaccinated mice [scFvaMHCII group 1 + 2(∆H1, ∆H7)] bound H1 and a range of other HA subtypes in ELISA (Fig. 5f, Supplementary Fig. 12). The binding reactivity of these antibodies mimicked the cross-reactivity observed with the inhibition ELISA. Antibodies purified from mice vaccinated with bivalent H1/H1 showed minor cross-reactivity to closely related H2 and H5, but had no significant reactivity to the other HA subtypes tested. This result confirms that serum antibodies elicited by mix vaccination show broad reactivity against various HAs.Collectively, these results show that the plasmid mix vaccine strategy induces antibodies that cross-react with the most similar HAs, suggesting that cross-reactive epitopes often may be limited to discrete groups of related HAs. Cross-reactivity between group 1 and 2 HAs appears lower than cross-reactivity within the groups, most likely due to the low sequence homology between HA of the two groups.Plasmid mix vaccines induce antibodies reacting to head and stems of HAs not included in the vaccineThe membrane proximal stem of HA is conserved and subdominant while the distal globular head is variable and immunodominant (Supplementary Fig. 1)4,30. We measured antibodies against the H1 and H7 globular heads and stem domains in ELISAs. We observed that all mice immunized with the group 1 + 2 (ΔH1ΔH7) 16 mix vaccine, whether MHCII-targeted or not, generated IgG that bound the H1 stem (Fig. 6a). IgG responses against the H7 stem were detected only in some mice (Fig. 6b), and titers were lower. Antibodies against globular heads of H1 and H7 were found in many but not all mice. Inclusion of H1 and H7 in the mix vaccine, containing all 18 HA subtypes, gave similar results.Fig. 6: Vaccination with HA plasmid mixes induces antibodies against both the stem and head domains of HAs not included in the mix.a, b Female BALB/cAnNRj mice were immunized three times (week 0, 5 and 9) i.m./EP with indicated plasmid mixtures (1 µg DNA/plasmid, n = 8/group). Controls were scFvαMHCII-H1/H1 and scFvαMHCII-H7/H7 (5 µg DNA/plasmid, n = 4/group) or NaCl (n = 8). We analyzed IgG titers against the H1 (a) and H7 (b) head (left panel) and stem (right panel) domains for week 11 sera. c–e Female BALB/cAnNRj mice were vaccinated twice (week 0 and 5) with the scFvαMHCII-group1 + 2(ΔH1ΔH7) mix (1 µg DNA/plasmid). Serum IgG titers against the stem and head domain of H1 and H7 were analyzed four weeks after the second vaccination. c Ratio of IgG titers against the HA head and HA stem domain of H1 (left, n = 39) or H7 (right, n = 32) for individual mice. d IgG titers against stem (left) or head (right) domains of H1 (n = 32) and H7 (n = 32). Sera from individual mice, interconnected by lines. e IgG titers of individual mice (n = 32) against the H1 head (black bars), H1 stem (green), H7 head (gray) and H7 stem (orange). Mice were grouped (vertical dashed lines) according to their serum specificity. f Mice were vaccinated thrice as in (a, b) with the vaccines indicated on the x-axis (n = 7 [scFvαMHCII-group1 + 2(ΔH1ΔH7)], n = 8 [scFvαNIP-group1 + 2(ΔH1ΔH7) and scFvαMHCII-group1 + 2], or n = 4 [scFvαMHCII-H1/H1]). Two weeks after the third vaccination, individual sera were analyzed for IgG binding to recombinant H1PR8 and various mutant H1PR8 lacking defined head determinants (box) (Supplementary Fig. 14). The ratio of binding (AUC) to each mutant H1/H1PR8 WT was calculated. Shown are titers or ratios for individual mice and mean ± SEM (a–c, f) or titers for individual mice (d, e). Statistics were calculated using Kruskal–Wallis with Dunn’s multiple comparisons test (a, b), two-tailed Mann–Whitney (c) or two-tailed Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test (d). Significant differences for ratios of serum from mix vaccinated mice compared to ratios for serum from H1/H1 vaccinated mice are indicated in (f). N.D. = non-detectable. n = 1 independent experiment. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageThese results were confirmed in a second experiment employing a large number of ΔH1ΔH7 mix-immunized mice (Supplementary Fig. 13a, b). Both H1- and H7-reactive IgG in serum from group 1 + 2 (ΔH1ΔH7)-vaccinated mice were skewed towards stem reactivity, as compared to control mice immunized with H1/H1 and H7/H7 bivalent vaccines (Fig. 6c). However, there was considerable variability in antibody specificity for H1 and H7 stem and head domains between individual mix-vaccinated mice (Fig. 6d, e), suggesting an oligoclonality of cross-reactive antibodies and a stochastic influence on specificity patterns.Plasmid mix vaccines induce antibodies skewed away from immunodominant antigenic sitesWe further analyzed the specificity of serum from vaccinated mice to the five main immunodominant antigenic sites (Sa, Sb, Ca1, Ca2 and Cb) in the head domain of H14,31,32. We coated ELISA wells with recombinant HA proteins derived from various mutated PR8 viruses in which four out of five (Δ4) antigenic sites were altered, leaving only the indicated immunodominant antigenic site intact (e.g. Sa in Sa∆4)33. A sixth mutant, S12, contained modifications in all five immunodominant sites34. The reactivity of serum from ΔH1ΔH7 mix-vaccinated mice to PR8 HA was not hampered by mutations that abrogated the immunodominant antigenic sites and showed strong reactivity to S12, indicating targeting of non-canonical antigenic sites. In contrast, sera from mice vaccinated with H1/H1 bivalent vaccines had reduced reactivity to most of the mutants, as would be expected (Fig. 6f and Supplementary Fig. 14). This indicates that the specificity pattern of antibodies elicited by mix vaccines is shifted away from the immunodominant antigenic sites. The inclusion of H1 (and H7) in the mix vaccine resulted in a reactivity pattern to the H1PR8 mutants that is more similar to that induced by the H1/H1 bivalent vaccine.Plasmid mix vaccine induces HA-specific T-cell responsesTo test if the mix vaccines could induce T cell responses, we immunized mice for various number of times with different plasmid mixes and analyzed T cell responses in draining lymph nodes (dLN) and spleen employing three sources of H1 peptides: IYSTVASSL, a Kd-restricted CD8 epitope35, conserved between the group 1 HA subtypes (Supplementary Fig. 1); an overlapping PR8 peptide pool; and an overlapping Cal07 peptide pool (Fig. 7, Supplementary Fig. 15a–c). Based on previous experiments with APC-targeted DNA vaccines25, T-cell responses were detected by the production of IFN-γ. The results show that: (i) the group 1 + 2 (∆H1∆H7) mix, lacking H1, induced IFN-γ T cell responses towards all three sources of H1 peptides; (ii) weak T cell responses were detected in dLN already 5 days after a single mix immunization and increased by day 11 post-vaccination (Fig. 7a, Supplementary Fig. 15a); (iii) three mix immunizations elicited increased responses, almost equal to those elicited by a positive control vaccine (MHCII-targeted H1/H1) (Fig. 7b); (iv) MHCII-targeting of mix vaccine enhanced responses only early (day 5) after a single vaccination (Fig. 7a); (v) The 18 HA mix vaccine, where PR8 H1 was included, induced higher T cell responses against H1 peptides than did the ΔH1ΔH7 mix (Fig. 7b, Supplementary Fig. 15a, b); (vi) H1-specific responses were mainly seen for CD8+ T cells (Supplementary Fig. 15b). Taken together, mix vaccines elicit T cells cross-reactive to non-included HA (H1). Inclusion of H1 in the mix, MHCII-targeting, and multiple immunizations, enhanced responses.Fig. 7: The HA mix vaccine induces IFN-γ secreting T cells.a Female BALB/cAnNRj mice were immunized once i.m./EP with DNA HA mix vaccines (1 µg DNA/plasmid, n = 8/group) as indicated. As controls, mice were vaccinated with scFvαMHCII-H1/H1 (H1 from PR8, 5 µg/plasmid, n = 3) or NaCl (n = 5). Draining lymph nodes (dLN) were collected 5 days after immunization, and IFN-γ secretion was measured by ELISPOT after stimulation with either IYSTVASSL (H1) peptide, or PR8- or Cal07-overlapping peptides (both H1N1). b Female BALB/cAnNRj mice were vaccinated three times (week 0, 5 and 9) i.m./EP with DNA HA mix vaccines (1 µg DNA/plasmid, n = 8/group) as indicated. Control mice were vaccinated with scFvαMHCII-H1/H1 (H1 from PR8, 5 µg/plasmid, n = 4) or NaCl (n = 8). Spleens were harvested two weeks after the third immunization and stimulated with HA peptides as in (a). IFN-γ secreting cells were analyzed by ELISPOT. Shown are the number of spot-forming cells (SFC) per 106 cells for individual mice and mean ± SEM. Significance was calculated using Kruskal–Wallis with Dunn’s multiple comparisons test, comparing the mix-immunized groups with the NaCl control and scFvαMHCII targeted with non-targeted control. Only differences scored as significant are indicated. n = 1 independent experiment. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageCross-reactive antibodies mediate protection against challenge with an HA heterologous influenza virusNext, we explored if the cross-reactive antibodies and T cells induced by the HA mix vaccines could protect against challenge with a heterologous virus that expresses an HA subtype not included in the mix. Mice were immunized thrice with a group 1 + 2 (ΔH1ΔH7) mix vaccine. Four weeks after the final vaccination, mice were challenged with a lethal dose (2.5xLD50) of H1 PR8 virus. Both MHCII-targeted and non-targeted mix vaccines induced a partial protection, with most mice losing a considerable amount of weight. However, both vaccines protected about 50% of the mice from reaching the endpoint of 20% weight loss (Fig. 8a). The positive control, MHCII-targeted H1/H1(PR8), induced full protection, as expected25. The mix vaccines reduced viral titers in the lungs of PR8-challenged mice (Supplementary Fig. 16a). When extending the challenge experiments to other H1 and H7 viruses we obtained divergent results. The plasmid mix vaccine did not offer significant protection to H7N1 virus (Aurkey/Italy/3889/1999) (Supplementary Fig. 16b) which, in our hands, is more pathogenic than PR8 virus. In contrast, mix-vaccinated mice were fully protected against challenge with 5 x LD50 Cal07 H1N1 virus two weeks after a third immunization (Fig. 8b). When the vaccine was generated as protein, two immunizations with the MHCII-targeted ΔH1ΔH7 mix protein fully protected mice against challenge with 5xLD50 PR8 virus, but only when delivered with AddaVax adjuvant (Fig. 8c).Fig. 8: The HA mix vaccine induces partial protection against heterologous influenza virus.a Female BALB/cAnNRj mice were immunized three times (week 0, 5 and 9) i.m./EP with the indicated DNA HA mix vaccines (1 µg DNA/plasmid, n = 7 [scFvαNIP-group1 + 2(ΔH1ΔH7)] or n = 9 [scFvαMHCII-group 1 + 2(ΔH1ΔH7)]). As controls, mice were immunized with scFvαMHCII-H1/H1 (H1 from either PR8, 5 µg/plasmid, n = 3) or NaCl (n = 10). Two weeks after the third immunization, mice were infected with 2.5xLD50 of H1N1 PR8 virus. b Mice were vaccinated as in (a) (n = 6 [scFvαMHCII-H1Cal07/H1Cal07], n = 9 [NaCl] or n = 10 [scFvαNIP- and scFvαMHCII-targeted mix vaccines]). Two weeks after the third immunization, mice were infected with 5xLD50 of H1N1 Cal07 virus. c Female BALB/cAnNRj mice were vaccinated twice (week 0 and 6) with scFvαMHCII-targeted HA mix protein vaccine or bivalent H1/H1 (PR8) as control (2.5 µg protein with or without AddaVax as adjuvant, n = 4/group). Seven weeks after the second immunization, mice were infected with 5xLD50 of H1N1 PR8 virus. d Female BALB/cAnNRj mice were immunized twice (week 0 and 5) i.m./EP with DNA HA mix vaccines (1 µg DNA/plasmid, n = 29). Controls were vaccinated with scFvαMHCII-targeted H1/H1 (PR8) or H7/H7 (5 µg/plasmid, n = 3/group) or NaCl (n = 6). Four weeks after the second immunization, mice were challenged with 5xLD50 of H1N1 PR8. Starting two days before challenge, mice vaccinated with the scFvαMHCII mix received either anti-CD4 plus anti-CD8 mAbs (n = 16) or isotype matched control mAbs (n = 13), every other day. Weight loss (mean ± SEM, left) and survival (right) are indicated in the panels. Mice were euthanized when they reached 80% of their initial weight and removed from the weight curves. Mean ± SEM is indicated with thick colored lines and symbols. Weight of individual mice indicated in stippled and faded lines. Significance was calculated using two-tailed Mantel–Cox (survival comparing mix vaccines to NaCl) or two-way ANOVA (weight curves). For T cell-depleted mice and isotype-matched controls compared in (d), n.s. = not significant. n = 1 independent experiment. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageThe partial protection against the PR8 heterologous challenge could be due to H1 cross-reactive antibodies (Figs. 4–6) or T cells (Fig. 7) induced by the group 1 + 2 (ΔH1ΔH7) mix vaccination. To test the contribution of antibodies and T cells, mice vaccinated twice with the MHCII targeted group 1 + 2 (ΔH1ΔH7) mix were depleted of T cells by injection of anti-CD4 and anti-CD8 mAbs (or isotype-matched control mAbs) starting two days prior to a challenge with 5 x LD50 of PR8 virus (Fig. 8d, Supplementary Fig. 16c). T cell-depleted mice were as well protected as non-depleted mice. However, only 10–20% of mice survived the challenge in either group, perhaps due to the high dose of influenza virus used for challenge. Nevertheless, the protection conferred by mix-vaccination, either in the absence or presence of T cell depletion, was significant compared to negative controls (NaCl and MHCII-targeted H7/H7 immunized mice). These results support a role for cross-reactive antibodies as mediators of the protection against virus with an HA subtype that was not included in the mix vaccine.DiscussionCurrent influenza vaccines induce predominantly strain-specific antibodies. These are protective as long as the infecting influenza strain matches the vaccine strains. An important goal in influenza vaccine research is therefore to develop universal vaccines that induce broadly reactive antibodies that protect against many, if not all, influenza strains.We recently observed that MHCII-specific heterodimeric vaccine proteins generated APC-B cell synapses23. Moreover, antigen bivalency, meaning that heterodimeric proteins express two identical antigens on both antigenic arms, was necessary to induce potent antibody responses, most likely due to BCR crosslinking. We here hypothesized that in a mixture of many different heterodimeric vaccine proteins, each of which always expresses two different but related antigens on its two arms, only conserved epitopes shared between the related but different antigens would be bivalent in a single heterodimeric vaccine protein. Consequently, B cells with a BCR that recognize these conserved bivalent epitopes should preferentially be stimulated. To test this hypothesis of valency-based immuno-selection, we generated a mixture of DNA plasmids that encoded heterodimeric vaccine proteins expressing 16 different IAV HA subtypes, each heterodimer carrying two different HAs. The plasmid mix induced cross-reactive antibodies against H1 and H7, which were not included in the mix. The cross-reactive antibodies partially and fully protected against two different hetero-subtypic H1 virus challenges in the absence of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.Analysis of sera from mix-immunized mice suggested that a fraction of induced antibodies was cross-reactive between H1 (or H7) and certain HA subtypes expressed in the mixed vaccine. These cross-reactive antibodies apparently bound shared conserved sites that ordinarily are subdominant. In inhibition ELISA, cross-reactive antibodies were only inhibited by HAs that were most homologous to non-included H1 (or H7) suggesting a restricted sharing of conserved epitopes among all HA subtypes. Supporting this notion, the mix vaccines elicited antibodies that cross-reacted between related HAs that had been included in the mix, again indicating that the vaccination strategy skews antibody responses towards conserved epitopes shared between similar HAs.The assay used here demonstrated cross-reactivity at the polyclonal antibody level. Generating mAb from mix-vaccinated mice should enable structural insights into the localization of conserved epitopes recognized by broadly cross-reactive antibodies. Our results suggest that relevant epitopes are localized to both the head and the stem of HA. There was, however, considerable heterogeneity between individual mice, indicating that cross-reactive B cell responses may be oligoclonal.Sera from mix-vaccinated mice did not have any meaningful neutralizing activity, but they were able to activate NK cells. Broadly reactive antibodies against HA often protect through FcγR-dependent mechanisms, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity36,37,38. Hence, it might be important that mixed plasmid vaccines skewed cross-reactive antibody responses towards the IgG2a subclass over IgG1. Important in this respect, the specificity of targeted vaccines for surface molecules on APC influences antibody isotype. For example, chemokines MIP-1α26 and Xcl139 predominantly induce FcγR-activating IgG2a antibodies. The MHCII-targeting used herein induced both IgG1 and IgG2a cross-reactive antibodies. Thus, substituting this targeting unit with MIP-1α or Xcl1 should further increase the IgG2a profile of cross-reactive antibodies and improve the ability of serum antibodies to engage in Fc-mediated ADCC.Other approaches that combine different HA variants into one vaccine have been used to induce cross-reactive antibodies against HA. We previously showed that simultaneous immunization with six group 1 HA subtypes expressed in MHCII-targeted vaccine proteins induced antibodies against H1 not included in the mix40. However, that study used DNA plasmids encoding protein chains that could form homodimers. Therefore, a fraction of secreted dimers are likely to bivalently express the same HA40, making interpretation more complicated compared to the present use of exclusively heterodimeric molecules.Kanekiyo et al. showed that heterotypic nanoparticles with eight different H1 head constructs induced broadly reactive antibodies41. The authors suggested that having an avidity advantage improves the activation of cross-reactive B cells, and subverts the activation of strain-specific B cells unable to bind shared epitopes41. Other groups have shown that intranasal delivery of a mixture of four different virus-like particles, each carrying a different HA subtype, induced significant protection against a variety of heterosubtypic IAV strains. However, this protection was likely not due to cross-reactive antibodies42. Sequential immunizations with chimeric HAs that combine the same stem domain with different irrelevant head domains induce cross-reactive antibody responses against the subdominant HA stem domain43. The computationally optimized broadly reactive antigen (COBRA) methodology, using multiple rounds of layered consensus building to generate influenza vaccine HA immunogens, induced broad hemagglutination inhibition activity as a head-based strategy44.The use of “mix vaccines” has also been studied for several other infectious diseases, including malaria45,46,47, HIV48 and infection with SARS-like viruses49. In silico work suggests that combining multiple malaria antigens in one vaccine favors affinity maturation towards cross-reactive antibodies45. Immunization with four different variants of AMA1 malaria antigen in rabbits enhanced cross-reactive responses as compared to immunization with one single AMA146. In silico models with HIV gp120 mix vaccines suggest that the generation of an optimal mix vaccine requires careful consideration of the number of antigens, their concentration, and the mutational distance between different antigens48. Single mosaic nanoparticles expressing the receptor binding site of eight SARS-CoV-2 related viruses induced cross-reactive antibodies targeting more conserved sites in mice and non-human primates49.The vaccination strategy used herein may be optimized and expanded. Many more HAs may be introduced into an expanded plasmid mix. Alternatively, mixes with only variants of H1, H3 or IBV HA could be generated to induce broad protection against strains that currently cause seasonal influenza epidemics. Besides influenza, the mixed strategy could be valuable for generating vaccines against other viral diseases, such as the highly polymorphic gp120 of HIV viruses or the spike of SARS-CoV-2.The mixed vaccine could be delivered both as plasmids and proteins, with similar results. This is to be expected since cells transfected with many (or all) mixed plasmids are likely to secrete heterodimeric molecules assembled stochastically in the ER22,23. Most likely, the heterodimeric mix vaccine could also be delivered as modified mRNA. Supporting this possibility, a recent publication from Arevalo et al. describes a multivalent mRNA vaccine encoding 18 IAV and 2 IBV HA subtypes. Vaccinated mice developed antibodies against all the included HA subtypes. However, it is unclear to what extent antibodies were cross-reactive or not50.Based on the present results using DNA delivery, and the apparently high immunogenicity of mRNA vaccines50, one may ask whether the valency-based immuno-selection mechanism afforded by our mix APC-targeting heterodimers would be maintained upon mRNA rather than DNA delivery. If so, the high immunogenicity of mRNA vaccines could nevertheless be outweighed by several advantages of plasmid delivery such as (i) ease of engineering and production, (ii) independence of a cold chain, and (iii) needle-free jet delivery51.A vaccine that reliably induces protection against multiple influenza strains may eliminate the need for annual updates of seasonal influenza vaccines. An important question is when such a vaccine should be administered since previous exposures to influenza viruses could thwart its effectiveness due to imprinting (original antigenic sin)52,53,54,55. Perhaps a valency-based mix vaccine should be the first immunization to influenza, given very early in childhood, before any imprinting has occurred. Arguing against a necessity of early mix vaccination, Arevalo et al. showed that prior infection of mice with an H1N1 virus did not hamper the induction of antibodies elicited by their mRNA mix vaccine50.MethodsMice, cell lines, and virusesFemale BALB/cAnNRj/c mice (Janvier Labs, Le Genest Saint Isle, France or Taconic biosciences inc, NY, USA), 6-8 weeks old, were used for the experiments. All experiments were reviewed and approved by the Norwegian Animal Research Authority and were carried out in accordance with the recommendations from the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the Norwegian National Institute of Health. HEK293E cells were from ATCC (RRID:CVCL0045, cat# CRL-1573, Manassas, USA). Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were likewise purchased from ATCC (RRID:CVCL0422, cat# CCL-34). Cells lines were cultured in complete medium: RPMI 1640 (R2405, Invitrogen) with 10% heat-inactivated FCS (F7524, Sigma), 24 mg/l gentamicin (Gensumycin®, VNR 453130, Sanofi-Aventis Norge AS), 50 µM monothioglycerol (M6145, Sigma), 1 mM sodium pyruvate (11360-039, Gibco), and 0.1 mM non-essential amino acids (11140-035, Gibco). The growth medium for MDCK cells contained the same supplements, but in DMEM (41965062, Life Technologies). Mouse-adapted (VR-95) and MDCK-adapted (VR-1469) viruses from strain A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1, PR8) were purchased from ATCC. Virus strain A/California/07/2009 (H1N1, Cal07) was kindly donated by Dr. A. Germundsson (The National Veterinary Institute, Oslo, Norway), the LD50 dose was established by the Reed and Muench method and titrations of virus in mice25. Virus from strain Aurkey/Italy/3889/1999 (H7N1) was kindly donated by Prof. Rebecca Cox (UiB, Bergen, Norway), and was mouse adapted in our lab before use.Generation of phylogenetic tree and multiple sequence alignment of HA proteinsThe phylogenetic tree was generated using a Clustal Omega multiple alignment of the amino acid sequences of the HA proteins used in this paper. The tree was made with the neighbor-joining method without distance correction (URL: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/56). The radial tree was visualized using an online version of TreeDyn 198.3 (URL: http://www.phylogeny.fr/57). The graphic amino acid alignment of the HA proteins used in this paper was made using blastp suite (URL: https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PROGRAM=blastp&PAGE_TYPE=BlastSearch&LINK_LOC=blasthome58).Cloning of heterodimeric vaccine vectorsDNA vaccines were encoded in the pLNOH2 vector under a CMV promotor and the signal peptide sequence from the VH gene of B1-8 mAb59. The targeting units, anti-MHCII (I-Ed, scFvαMHCII from mouse 14-4-4 S mAb) and anti-NIP (scFvαNIP from mouse B1-8 mAb) were subcloned from previously constructed plasmids27. The heterodimerization unit was based on a modified Fos-Jun based leucine zipper motif consisting of ACID (QLEKELQALEKENAQLEKELQALEKELAQ) and BASE (QLKKKLQALKKKNAQLKKKLQALKKKLAQ) sequences on separate protein chains. Sequences for the A/B dimerization motif were kindly donated by Dr. Elisabeth Mellins24. Within the previously constructed vaccine plasmids, two A or two B motifs were spaced by a linker (GGGSGGLTKFGGSTTAPS), and placed C-terminal of the hinge exon 1 from human IgG322. The HA subtype strains used for H1-18 of IAV are listed in Table 1, and the amino acid sequences of each HA subtype strain are shown in Supplementary Fig. 1. H1 from PR8 and A/California/07/2009 (Cal07)25, H5, H6, H8, H9, H11, H1340 and H760 were subcloned from existing plasmids with restriction enzyme SfiI25. The remainder of the HA genes were amplified from mammalian codon optimized cDNA (Sino Biological, category numbers indicated in Supplementary Table I) by PCR with specifically designed primers (Sigma):H2165′: ACCGGCCTCGGTGGCCTGGACCAGATTTGTATTGGCTACC,H25393′: ACCGGCCCTGCAGGCCTCAGAGGCTCAGGGATCCAG,H3175′: GGCCTCGGTGGCCTGCAAGACCTTC,H35383′: ACCGGCCCTGCAGGCCTCATCAAATAGCAAAAG,H4175′: ACCGGCCTCGGTGGCCTGCAGAACTACACAGGCAACC,H45373′: ACCGGCCCTGCAGGCCTCAGGAGATGCTGAAGGAGAAC,H1018/H15195′: ACCGGCCTCGGTGGCCTGGACAAGATTTGTCTGGGACACC,H10534/H155433′: ACCGGCCCTGCAGGCCTCAGGAGGCTCCAAAGGAGAAC,H12185′: ACCGGCCTCGGTGGCCTGGACAAGATTTGTATTGGCTACCAG,H122393′: ACCGGCCCTGCAGGCCTCACAGGGAGGATGCCACAGA,H14185′: ACCGGCCTCGGTGGCCTGCAGATTACCAATGGCACCAC,H145413′: ACCGGCCCTGCAGGCCTCAACTCATACTGAAGGAAATCCACAG,H16205: ACCGGCCTCGGTGGCCTGGACAAGATTTGTATTGGCTACCTG,H165413′: ACCGGCCCTGCAGGCCTCACAGCACAATGCTGGAGGC,H17195′: ACCGGCCTCGGTGGCCTGGACAGGATTTGTATTGGCTACCAG,H175413′: ACCGGCCCTGCAGGCCTCACAGCACCACAGAGGAGGC,H18155′: ACCGGCCTCGGTGGCCTGGACCAGATTTGCATCGGC, andH185383′: ACCGGCCCTGCAGGCCTCACAGCACGACACTTGAGGC (SfiI sites indicated in italic, stop codon in bold). Primers were designed to exclude the intrinsic HA signal peptide and most of the transmembrane region from the HA gene. The primer names show the amino acid numbers included for the individual HA subtypes.Transient transfection of HEK293E cellsHEK293E cells (5 × 105) in 5 ml complete medium per well were seeded in 6 well culture plates (3506, Corning), and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2. The following day, the complete medium was replaced by FreeStyle™ 293 serum free medium (12338002, Life Technologies) with 24 mg/l gentamicin before cells were transfected with 2.5 µg DNA of A and B plasmids (5 µg in total) with 10 µg Polyethylenimine (23966, Polysciences). To produce HA mix proteins with 18 different plasmids, 5 µg DNA/plasmid and 200 µl polyethylenimine were used for transient transfection of HEK293E cells in T175 flasks. Supernatants were collected after 3-4 days, and centrifuged 5 min at 350 xg. For Western blot analysis and HA mix heterodimer ELISA, supernatants were concentrated 10 times using Vivaspin 20 spin columns with 10 kDa cut off (VS2002, Sartorius).Protein purificationFor the production of larger amounts of MHCII-targeted ΔH1ΔH7 mix and MHCII-targeted H1/H1 vaccine proteins, HEK293E cells were transfected with a total of 250 µg DNA in BD Falcon® 5-layer multiflasks (353114, Corning) in FreeStyleTM 293 serum free medium. Proteins were purified using an affinity column with anti-A/B mAb (clone 2H11, produced from hybridoma kindly provided by E.L. Reinherz61) coupled to CNBr activated Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (17-0981-01, GE healthcare).ELISA to detect vaccine proteinsHigh binding 96 well plates (3590, Corning) were coated with 1 µg/ml anti-A/B mAb, or anti-IAV H1N1 (A/Puerto Rico/8/1934) HA (clone H36-4-52, produced from hybridoma provided by Siegfried Weiss62 mAb in PBS, incubated at 4 °C overnight, and blocked with 200 µl blocking buffer (1% w/v BSA in PBS with 0.02% w/v Na-Azide) per well. Supernatants from transfected HEK293E cells were added (50 µl/well) and serially diluted 3-fold in triplicates with ELISA buffer (0.1% w/v BSA and 0.2% Tween 20 in PBS/Na-Azide). Plates were incubated for 2 hours at room temperature. Vaccine proteins were detected for 1 hour with 1 µg/ml biotinylated anti-H1 mAb, a cross-reactive rabbit mAb specific for IAV HA stem (1:3000, clone #2, 86001-RM01, Sino Biological), or 1 µg/ml rabbit-anti-AIV H3N2 (A/Brisbane/10/2007) HA mAb (clone# 104, 11056-R104, Sino Biological). Biotinylated mAb was detected with streptavidin-Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) conjugate (1:3000, RPN1234, Southern Biotech) and rabbit mAbs with polyclonal (p) anti-rabbit IgG Ab-ALP conjugate (1:3000, A3687, Sigma Aldrich). Signals were developed with phosphatase substrate (1 mg/ml, P4744, Sigma) dissolved in diethanolamine substrate buffer. OD405nm was measured using EnVision 2104 Multilabel Reader with EnVision Manager 1.12 software (PerkinElmer).Western blot analysisConcentrated supernatants were normalized on a dot blot with 3-fold serial dilutions of supernatant in PBS and detected with 0.33 µg/ml anti-A/B mAb. Approximately similar amounts of vaccine proteins were run on a Bolt™ 4-12% Bis-Tris Plus gel (NW04122BOX, Invitrogen). Proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane using the iBlot2 gel transfer system with a PVDF transfer stack (IB24002, Invitrogen). Membranes were blocked using 2% blocking reagent (RPN2125, GE Healthcare) in 0.1% tween 20 in PBS. Vaccine proteins were detected with 0.33 µg/ml biotinylated anti-A/B mAb followed by streptavidin-HRP conjugate (1:3000, 7100-05, Southern Biotech). Blots were captured using G:box Chemi XX6 device (SYNGENE).DNA vaccinationMice were anaesthetized by an interperitoneal injection with 0.06 ml/10 gr body weight of a cocktail of Tiletamin/Zolazepam (250 mg/ml, Zoletil Forte, Vibrac), xylazine (Rompun, 20 mg/ml, Bayer Animal Health), and fentanyl (50 µg/ml, Actavis). Plasmids were purified using Endofree Megaprep plasmid purification kits (12381, Qiagen), and recovered in 0.9% NaCl solution (VNR 451773, B. Braun). Bivalent scFvαMHCII-H1-18/H1-18 vaccines contained 0.05 µg/µl − 0.5 µg/µl of both A and B DNA plasmids (0.1–1 µg/µl DNA in total). Mix vaccines contained 0.02 µg/µl in 50 µl (i.d. vaccination) or 0.01 µg/µl in 100 µl (i.m. vaccination) of each included plasmid vector (for a final dose of 1 µg/plasmid in total per mouse). For i.d vaccinations, 25 µl DNA was injected in the lower back near the base of the tail on both flanks, immediately followed by EP with DermaVax (BTX Harvard Apparatus), delivered in two pulses of 450 V/cm × 2.5 µs plus eight pulses of 110 V/cm × 8.1 ms. For i.m. vaccination, 50 µl DNA was injected in the quadriceps femoris muscle of each leg, followed by EP with Elgen 1000 Needle Electroporator (Inovio Biomedical), delivered as 5 × 60 ms at 50 V/400 mA with 200 ms delay. In many experiments, mice were immunized three times, at week 0, 5 and 9 unless otherwise specified. Blood samples were collected from the saphenous vein, spun down twice, and sera frozen at −20 °C. Blood was collected at weeks 1, 3, on the day of immunization and two weeks after the second and third immunization.Protein vaccinationProteins (50 µg/ml in PBS) were combined in a 1:1 ratio with adjuvant AddaVax (vac-adx-10, Invivogen) or PBS for non-adjuvanted controls. Hind legs of mice were shaved, and 50 µl vaccine protein was injected in the quadriceps femoris muscle on each side, resulting in a final vaccine dose of 2.5 µg protein per mouse. Mice were immunized with protein twice, at week 0 and 7, and blood was collected at 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 and 13 weeks after the first immunization.ELISA for HA-reactive antibodies in serumThe serum ELISAs were run as described above for protein ELISAs except for the following: Recombinant HA or HA1 subunit protein (0.5 µg/ml, Sino Biologicals, category numbers indicated in Supplementary Table I), or inactivated mouse adapted H1N1 PR8 virus (1:1600, 10100782, Charles River Laboratories) in PBS were used as coat. Serum was serially diluted 3-fold in ELISA buffer starting at 1:50. HA-reactive antibodies were detected with anti-mouse IgG pAb-ALP conjugate (1:5000, A2429, Sigma Aldrich). IgG subtypes were detected with biotinylated 1 µg/ml anti-mouse IgG1[a] (1:500, clone10.9, 553500, BD Biosciences) or anti-mouse IgG2a[a] (1:500, clone 8.3, 553502, Biosciences) followed by detection with streptavidin-HRP (1:5000, Southern Biotech) and 100 µl TMB solution (CL07-1000ML, Merck Millipore). Signal development was stopped with 100 µl 1 M sulfuric acid, and OD450nm was measured. The Ab titer was defined as the final dilution that resulted in OD405nm or OD450nm values > (2 x mean) of NaCl-vaccinated mice. Samples with a titer <50 were given an endpoint titer of 1.Some ELISAs were performed with recombinant HA protein from PR8 viruses that were mutated to abolish four out of five of the major H1 antigenic sites (Δ4 mutants)33, and a mutant that was altered all five major antigenic sites, abrogating binding of most tested mAb towards these sites (S12)34. The mutant proteins were produced and purified as described previously33. The recombinant HA proteins were used as ELISA coat at a concentration of 1 µg/ml. Serum IgG titers towards the mutated HA was analyzed as described above.ELISA for detection of HA stem-specific antibodiesHEK293E cells were transfected with plasmids encoding dimeric fusion proteins that expressed a scFv against the hapten 4-ethoxymethylene-2-phenyl-2-oxazoline-5-one (phOx)63 linked to the human Ig-hinge regions h1 and h3, and CH3 from human IgG3 as dimerization unit27, and to the HA stem derived from either H1 or H7 as antigenic unit64 to form scFvαphOx-CH3-HA stem proteins. phOx (E0753-1G, Sigma) was coupled to BSA. The resulting phOx-BSA (1 µg/ml) was used as coat, and supernatant with scFvαphOx-CH3-HA stem proteins was added and incubated for 2 hours. The scFvαphOx -CH3-HA stem supernatant was exchanged with fresh supernatant twice to obtain a saturated coating with protein dimers. The presence of scFvαphOx -CH3-HA stem in the ELISA was confirmed through binding of mAb towards the human IgG3-based dimerization motif (anti-human IgG-Biotin, 1 µg/ml, clone HP-6017, B3773, Sigma) and rabbit anti-HA stem mAb (1:3000) detected with anti-rabbit IgG Ab-ALP. Mice sera were serially diluted 3-fold in ELISA buffer, starting at 3:50. HA stem-specific antibodies were detected with anti-mouse IgG-ALP conjugate.Microneutralization assayThe viral 50% TCID of MDCK-adapted H1N1 PR8 influenza virus was determined using the Reed-Muench method65. Serum from vaccinated mice was mixed in 1:3 ratio with receptor destroying enzyme from cholera filtrate (C8772, Sigma) incubated at 37 °C for 20 hours, and heat-inactivated at 56 °C for 60 min. Starting at 1:10 dilution, 2-fold serial dilutions of treated serum was incubated with equal volumes of 100xTCID50 PR8 virus in virus diluent (DMEM supplemented with 48 mg/l gentamicin, 100 μM monothioglycerol, 2 mM sodium pyruvate, 0.2 mM non-essential amino acids, 1% bovine albumin fraction V (10735078001, Roche), 0.02 M HEPES (83264-100ML-F, Sigma), and 1 µg/ml TPCK-Trypsin (T1426-100MG, Sigma)) for 2 hours on 96-wells plates at 37 °C at 5% CO2. As controls, four wells on each plate contained only virus and four wells contained only virus diluent. MDCK cells (2 × 102) were added to each well and incubated for 18 hours at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cells were washed with PBS, fixed with cold 80% acetone for 10 min, and viral nucleoprotein was detected in ELISA using biotinylated anti-nucleoprotein mAb (1 µg/ml, clone HB65, produced from hybridoma, H16-L10-4R5, ATCC) followed by streptavidin-ALP (1:3000). Plates were developed and read as described above.Analysis of antibody-mediated NK cell activationTo determine ADCC, we adapted a protocol from Jegaskanda et al.36 Briefly, spleens were harvested from naïve BALB/cAnNRj/c mice and dissociated in gentleMACS™ C Tubes (130-096-334, Miltenyi Biotech). Splenocytes were treated with Tris-buffered ammonium chloride for 5 min on ice. Cells were filtered through a 70 nm Nylon strainer (732-2758, VWR). NK cells were isolated using an NK cell negative selection kit (130-115-818, Miltenyi Biotech) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. NK cell purity was determined by Flow cytometry. Purified NK cells were pre-activated overnight with IL15 (10 ng/ml, 447-ML-010, R&D systems) in a complete medium at 37 °C and 5% CO2. High-binding 96 well plates were coated with 0.25 µg/ml recombinant H1PR8 protein in PBS, at 4 °C overnight. Coated plates were washed five times with PBS and blocked for 2 hours in 200 µl 1% w/v BSA in PBS at room temperature. Then, wells were incubated with heat-inactivated serum from vaccinated mice at 4 °C overnight. The next day, plates were washed five times with PBS, and 0.5 × 106 pre-activated NK cells resuspended in 100 µl complete cell medium supplemented with 10 ng/ml IL15, anti-mouse CD107a (LAMP-1)-PE antibody (2 µg/ml, clone 1D4B, 121612, Biolegend) and GolgiPlug™ protein transport inhibitor (1:1000, 555029, BD Biosciences) were added to the wells. Cells were incubated for 5 hours at 37 °C and 5% CO2, after which NK cells were washed, stained with Ghost Dye™ Violet 510 (1:400, SKU 1-0870-T500, TONBO) and blocked with 20% rat serum, followed by staining with anti-mouse CD3e-FITC (5 µg/ml, clone 145-2C11, 35-0031-U500, TONBO) and NKp46-eFluor 450 (2 µg/ml, clone 29A1.4, 48-3351-82, ThermoFisher Scientific). Stained cells were fixed in 3% formaldehyde, permeabilized with Perm/Was buffer (554723, BD Biosciences) and stained intracellularly with anti-mouse IFN-γ-APC (5 µg/ml, clone XMG1.2, 20-7311-U100, TONBO). Cells were analyzed using an Attune NxT flow cytometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and FlowJo software version 10.8.1 (BD Biosciences).Inhibition analysis in ELISASera were diluted to approximately 0.5 OD405nm, as determined in preceding serum ELISA titrations for coat HA-reactive antibodies, and incubated with various recombinant HA (5 µg/ml, H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6, H7, H9, H15, or H16) in binding buffer (PBS with 1% BSA and 0.2% tween 20) for 1 hour at room temperature. Serum-HA mixtures were transferred in triplicates to plates coated with recombinant H1, H7, H2, H3 or H5 (0.5 µg/ml) and incubated at room temperature for 1 h, before total IgG was detected as described above. OD405nm from NaCl mice sera (diluted 1:50) was subtracted as background before calculating the relative inhibition (%) of OD405nm signal of competed serum compared to serum that was pre-incubated with binding buffer alone (non-competed serum).Purification of H1-reactive antibodies from mouse serumRecombinant H1 protein from PR8 (11684-V08H, Sino Biological) was coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4 fast flow (1.5 mg protein:1 ml sepharose, 17098101, Cytiva). Antibodies were purified from 300 µl pooled mouse serum using the coupled sepharose in Pierce™ spin columns (69705, Thermo Fisher). After extensive washing of beads, antibodies were eluted with 1 column volume 0.1 M glycine HCl pH 2.7. The pH of the eluate was neutralized by adding 2 column volumes of 0.1 M glycine HCl pH 8.0. The glycine HCl solution was exchanged for PBS using three rounds of centrifugation with centrifugal filters with 10 kDa cut-off (UFC501, Merck), ending with a final volume of 100 µl.T cell ELISPOTIFN-γ secreting T cells were analyzed using a Mouse IFN-γ ELISpotPLUS kit (3321-4APT-2, Mabtech) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Spleens or draining lymph nodes were harvested from vaccinated mice and dissociated in gentleMACS™ C Tubes. Splenocytes were treated with Tris-buffered ammonium chloride for 5 min on ice. Cells were filtered through a 70 nm Nylon strainer before counting, and 5 × 105 viable splenocytes or 2.5 × 105 draining lymph node cells per well in a complete medium were seeded in the pre-coated ELISPOT plates. Cells were re-stimulated for 20 hours at 37 °C at 5% CO2 with overlapping HA peptides from H1N1 viruses PR8 (PM-INFA-HAPR) or Cal07 (PM-INFA-HACal, 15-mers with 11 aa overlap, 0.1 µg/peptide/ml, JPT Peptide Technologies GmbH), or with 2 µg/ml H1 peptide (aa 532–540, IYSTVASSL, Kd, GenScript). Spots were counted automatically using an ImmunoSpot® CORE cell counter (Cellular Technology Limited). For each sample, spot counts from wells stimulated with 2 µg/ml of an irrelevant peptide (aa 91-107, ALWFRNHFVFGGGTKVT, of the λ2 chain of the M315 mouse myeloma protein, GenScript) were subtracted as background.Viral challenge with influenza virusBALB/c mice were anaesthetized as described under DNA vaccination. H1N1 PR8 virus, H1N1 Cal07 virus or Aurkey/Italy/3889/1999 (H7N1) virus stocks were diluted to either 2.5xLD50 or 5xLD50 in PBS as described per experiment, and administered in 10 µl to each nostril. Weight loss was monitored, and 20% weight loss was used as humane endpoint as approved by the Norwegian Animal Research Authority. Mice that reached this endpoint were euthanized and excluded from the weight curves from that point on.T cell depletionBALB/c mice were treated with intraperitoneal injections with 100 µl PBS with 100 µg of both purified anti-CD4 (clone GK1.5, produced from hybridoma TIB207, ATCC) and anti-CD8 (clone 53-6.72, produced from hybridoma TIB105, ATCC), or with isotype matched controls (clone SFR8-B6 produced from HB-152, and clone Y13-238 produced from CRL-1741, both from ATCC), starting two days before challenge. Injections were repeated every second day until the end of the experiment. Mice were challenged with 5xLD50 H1N1 PR8 virus, as described above.Statistical analysisResults were graphed and analyzed for significance using GraphPad Prism 8 software. Antibody titers and data from T cell ELISPOT and flow cytometry analysis were compared using Kruskal-Wallis with Dunn’s multiple comparisons test. Protein expression by transfected HEK239E cells and weight loss at day 4-6 after viral challenges were compared between groups using one-way ANOVA with Dunnet’s multiple comparisons test. Complete weight loss curves after infection were compared using two-way ANOVA. Survival curves were analyzed for significance using the Mantel–Cox test. In inhibition ELISA, correlations between % homology of competing HA with coat HA and % inhibition was analyzed with the Pearson correlation coefficient. P values < 0.05 were considered as statistically significant.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.

However, the immune response is often produced against the immunodominant, variable region of hemagglutinin, while it is of interest to develop broadly neutralizing antibodies against the stem region, which is conserved. Eliciting an immune response against a conserved region promises broader protection against other strains. Immunofocusing aims to accomplish this by targeting the immune response towards conserved epitopes on the antigen.This approach is not only of interest in flu vaccine development, but also for other viral proteins, including the HIV-1 Env protein, SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and Ebola glycoprotein. Developing epitope-focused vaccines against conserved regions of viral proteins is a major part of pandemic preparedness.

There is still a lot of respiratory virus activity, so it’s not time to let our guard down. At this point in the season, vaccination uptake for COVID-19 and flu is slightly lower than last season, which means many people are missing out on this layer of protection. Summary What CDC knows Hospital admissions for COVID-19, flu, and RSV have been declining in most parts of the country for the past few weeks. Some key indicators, however, show that flu activity is rising again in some parts of the United States. CDC expects many more weeks of respiratory disease circulation and possibly a second wave of flu activity. What CDC is doing CDC continues to track indicators of respiratory virus activity. You can protect yourself by staying up to date on your vaccines and with timely use of testing, treatment, and other measures. Hospitalizations and deaths are below last season’s After a late December surge, respiratory virus activity has been declining for weeks, with most indicators trending down. Weekly hospitalization rates for COVID-19, flu, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) declined through most of January. However, respiratory disease activity remains elevated, and some flu activity indicators have increased again. Test positivity for flu rose nationally in late January and has leveled off since but continues to increase in parts of the country. Emergency department visits for flu have been going up in some areas of the county. While the respiratory virus season is likely past its peak, it is definitely not over. There is still a lot of respiratory virus activity, so it's not time to let our guard down. As we saw last season, COVID-19, flu, and RSV account for a large proportion of hospitalizations for respiratory viruses during the fall and winter months. This season, flu and RSV illnesses started increasing later in the fall, which is more like what we typically saw before the pandemic. This season's peak in combined COVID-19, flu, and RSV hospitalizations was not as high as last season's. And there were fewer reports of healthcare strain this season. Additionally, cumulative hospitalizations and deaths due to COVID-19 and flu are lower this season than they were at this time last season. There’s still time to get your vaccines This was the first season where vaccines were available for COVID-19, flu, and RSV. At this point in the season, vaccination uptake for COVID-19 and flu is slightly lower than last season, which means many people are missing out on this layer of protection against the most severe outcomes of these illnesses. Twenty-two percent of adults have received the updated COVID-19 vaccine this season, including 42% of people 65 and older, who are among those at highest risk of severe disease. COVID-19 activity remains high, and getting vaccinated can protect you from severe illness, hospitalization, and death. An estimated 48% of adults have received a flu vaccine this season. The timing of flu seasons is unpredictable, and in some years significant flu activity has lasted into May. The good news is, if you haven't yet gotten your flu vaccine there is still time, so that you can reduce your risk of flu and its potentially serious outcomes if you do get sick. Similar to flu season, RSV infections usually begin to increase in the fall and peak in winter. During the 2021-22 and 2022-23 seasons, the number of RSV cases started increasing as early as July. Early vaccination ensures protection from RSV by the time activity begins to rise in communities. At this point, 22% of adults 60 years and older have received an RSV vaccination. It is important for people 60 years and older to talk to their healthcare provider to see if RSV vaccination is right for them. Reminder for healthcare providers: We're out of the seasonal window for timely RSV vaccination of pregnant people in most areas of the country, which is recommended only through the end of January. Babies younger than 8 months, and some older babies, can still get protection against RSV with an immunization called nirsevimab. Most babies younger than 8 months do not need nirsevimab if their mother got an RSV vaccine. Additional actions to protect yourself against respiratory viruses Testing to determine the cause of respiratory symptoms can help inform recommendations about the most appropriate treatment. Tests, including at-home tests for COVID-19, can detect these respiratory viruses so patients can better understand their illness and take next steps. Prescription treatments are available for both COVID-19 and flu. Other tools that can help prevent the spread of COVID-19, flu, and RSV include masking, physical distancing, washing hands, and improving airflow in the places where people live and work. More info for data mavens: Two systems for tracking COVID-19 and flu hospitalizations CDC tracks COVID-19 and flu hospitalizations in two different but complementary ways. When you're diving into the details, it's important to understand the differences. For example, some have noted that COVID-19 hospitalizations appear consistently higher in one system, but it looked like flu had a higher hospitalization rate in another. Let's dig in. The National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) collects reports from all U.S. hospitals on COVID-19 and flu-associated hospitalizations. NHSN hospital data are national and provide a broader geographic picture of hospitalizations in terms of total numbers. NHSN data provide overall counts of hospitalizations and only some limited patient information. Additionally, NHSN does not include data on RSV hospitalizations. NHSN shows that COVID-19 hospitalizations have consistently outpaced flu hospitalizations in terms of total numbers. By comparison, the Respiratory Virus Hospitalization Surveillance Network (RESP-NET) collects data from acute care hospitals in select communities in multiple states where nearly 10% of the U.S. population lives. RESP-NET collects detailed (but anonymous) data on a wide range of patient and clinical characteristics for laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, flu, and RSV hospitalizations. These data are used to calculate hospitalization rates by age and race/ethnicity. Additionally, RESP-NET data are used to analyze and conduct analyses to determine risk factors for severe outcomes, including ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and death. RESP-NET shows that overall population-based flu-associated hospitalization rates topped COVID-19-related rates during the last week of December in areas where data is captured in RESP-NET. Among adults ages 65 years and older, who make up two-thirds of all COVID-19 hospitalizations, rates of COVID-19 hospitalizations remained higher than those for flu for all weeks. From RESP-NET, we know that COVID-19-related illness was the likely presenting complaint on admission for about 80% of older patients with COVID-19-associated hospitalizations.

Woods, 48, withdrew on Friday and early reports indicated that he had to do so because of an unknown illness, which he clarified via X on Saturday. I would like to confirm that I had to withdraw from @thegenesisinv due to illness, which we now know is influenza. I am resting and feeling better. Good luck to the players this weekend. I’m disappointed to not be there and want to thank @GenesisUSA and all the fans for the…— Tiger Woods (@TigerWoods) February 17, 2024 "I am resting and feeling better," Woods' post said. "Good luck to the players this weekend. I'm disappointed to not be there."Woods abruptly withdrew after hitting his tee shot on the seventh hole during the second round of play. "He started feeling some flu-like symptoms last night," said Rob McNamara, the Executive Vice President of TGR Ventures, Woods' company. "Woke up this morning, they were worse than the night previous. He had a bit of a fever and that, and was better during the warm-up, but then when he got out there and was walking and playing, he started feeling dizzy." McNamara says that the withdrawal has nothing to do with an injury. "His back's fine," he said. "It was all medical illness, dehydration." Tiger Woods hits a shot from the rough on the 4th hole during the Genesis Invitational at Riviera Country Club on February 15, 2024 in Pacific Palisades, California. (Photo by Mel Blackmon/CBS) It was just Woods' sixth PGA Tour event since February of 2021, when he was in a violent car crash in Rancho Palos Verdes that left him with multiple fractures to his right leg and ankle. He's only finished two of those events, playing all 72 holes in the 2022 Masters and last year's Genesis Invitational. Last year, after withdrawing from the 2023 Masters, Woods underwent a "subtalar fusion procedure to address his post-traumatic arthritis from his previous talus fracture.," according to a statement he released on X at the time. This year's tournament was his first PGA event since having his ankle fused in April 2023. Prior to withdrawing on Friday, Woods was among the 11 golfers tied for 49th overall, one shot over 72 and eight shots off the tournament lead. Woods, who hosts the Genesis Invitational, has played in 16 versions of the event, beginning in 1992 when he was just 16-years-old. He has yet to win, however. "I have traditionally not putted well here," Woods said to reporters on Wednesday. "This is a fader's delight, most of the holes are, for a righty, run left to right. I've driven it well here. There are small greens and traditionally throughout my entire career, my iron game has been pretty good, but I have never really gotten hot with the putter at this course."At the end of play on Friday, former UCLA standout and Long Beach native Patrick Cantlay led at 13-under 129.Despite recent health struggles, Woods is still tied for the most all-time victories on the PGA Tour with 82 after winning the 2019 Zozo Championship.

Strep tends to be most prevalent in early spring. So this illness will be around for the next few months. "Dr. Kelly Levasseur -- Medical Director, Pediatric Emergency Department, Children’s Hospital of Michigan“We’ve been seeing a bump in influenza cases in the last 10 or 14 days, and we’re up to about 30% positivity rate in the patients we’re testing (all admitted patients and many outpatients are tested). Many have high fevers and they feel pretty bad. Once we get their temperature down, they do better. Parents or caregivers can give Tylenol and Motrin for fever. It’s ok if they don’t want to eat, but they have to keep drinking so they don’t become dehydrated. In younger kids, we’re seeing fevers and difficulty breathing. RSV numbers are down, and there are so many other viruses that are causing similar symptoms. We’re also seeing a lot of kids coming in with vomiting and diarrhea that isn’t flu.”Dr. Jennifer Stephens-Hoyer -- Emergency Department, Henry Ford Medical Center Plymouth“We are seeing continued cases of COVID-19 infection, Influenza A, and Strep infections in the community. Also, we are seeing exacerbations of long-term illnesses like congestive heart failure and diabetes. The severity of long-term illness exacerbations seems to be greater overall than in years past, which is likely due to multiple reasons, including increased baseline levels of illnesses in our population.”Oakland County – Covid, influenza, RSV.Dr. Steven McGraw -- Chair of Emergency Medicine, Ascension Providence Hospital, Southfield & Novi Campus“I’m seeing patients with COVID-19 and Influenza, but both seem to be slowing slightly, as expected during this time. For COVID-19, flu and/or RSV the best protection is to be up to date on vaccines.”Dr. Rena Daiza -- Primary Care Physician, Henry Ford Medical Center Bloomfield Twp.“This week I had a few patients test positive for influenza. It is not too late to get a flu shot to protect yourself. Flu season typically peaks between December and February, but the season does not end until late spring and well into May.”Emergency Department, Henry Ford West Bloomfield Hospital“We are seeing a variety of pain complaints, fatigue/weakness, and respiratory issues.”Washtenaw County– Influenza, Covid, upper respiratory infections.Dr. Brad Uren -- Clinical Associate Professor of Emergency Medicine, Michigan Medicine“Still seeing some COVID, not usually requiring admission. Fair amount of flu and other URIs. A moderate amount of GI illnesses.”Washtenaw County Health Department“Influenza cases in Washtenaw County residents are currently at high levels. Most Influenza cases being reported in Washtenaw County are Influenza A, types A(H1N1) and A(H3). Sporadic cases of Influenza B are being reported. Influenza-related deaths in Washtenaw County adults have been reported this flu season. All individuals were older adults with confirmed Influenza A infection. Flu-related hospitalizations of Washtenaw residents are currently at high levels.”Monroe County – Respiratory illnesses, influenza, Covid, pneumonia, strep throat, colds, asthma flare-ups.ProMedica Monroe Regional Hospital – Emergency Center“This week at ProMedica Monroe Regional Hospital we are still seeing a high number of respiratory illnesses, including influenza A and B, COVID-19, and pneumonia. Strep throat is also on the rise.”Macomb County – Upper respiratory viruses, influenza, RSV, Covid, stomach viruses, breathing problems.Dr. Ali Saad -- Emergency physician at McLaren Macomb“Viral URIs, including flu, RSV, and some COVID-19, continue to be reported in significant volumes to the emergency department, though most patients experience mild symptoms and are discharged following treatment. Weather conditions have caused asthma sufferers to experience breathing complications. Following a slight tapering off, cases of viral gastroenteritis have rebounded, causing nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Winter weather conditions have caused many falls, resulting in orthopedic injuries ranging from fractured extremities to dislocated joints.”Livingston County -- Did not report this weekCopyright 2024 by WDIV ClickOnDetroit - All rights reserved.About the AuthorsSarah Mayberry, M.P.H. headshotSarah Mayberry, M.P.H.emailFrank McGeorge, MD headshotFrank McGeorge, MDDr. McGeorge can be seen on Local 4 News helping Metro Detroiters with health concerns when he isn't helping save lives in the emergency room at Henry Ford Hospital.emailClick here to take a moment and familiarize yourself with our Community Guidelines.Loading...Recommended VideosTV ListingsEmail NewslettersRSS FeedsContests and RulesContact UsCareers at WDIVClosed Captioning / Audio DescriptionPublic FileTerms of UsePrivacy PolicyDo Not Sell My InfoFCC ApplicationsCookie PreferencesFollow UsVisit our YouTube page (opens in a new tab)Visit our Facebook page (opens in a new tab)Visit our Instagram page (opens in a new tab)Visit our X page (opens in a new tab)Visit our RSS Feed page (opens in a new tab)Get Results With OmneIf you need help with the Public File, call (313) 222-0556.At WDIV, we are committed to informing and delighting our audience.

Qualitywatch Indicator Last updated: 15/02/2024 BackgroundFor most people, the flu - albeit an unpleasant illness - is not serious. However, certain people are more likely to develop serious complications of flu, such as bronchitis and pneumonia. Influenza immunisation has been recommended in the UK since the late 1960s, with the aim of protecting clinically at-risk groups who are at a higher risk of influenza-associated morbidity and mortality. In 2000, the policy was extended to include all people aged 65 years and over, and in 2010 pregnancy was added as a clinical risk category. In 2013-14, the childhood programme was first implemented to target children from the age of two to nine years old. This was extended in 2018-19 to all those aged 10 years old. In the winter of 2020-21, during the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, the flu vaccination programme was expanded to include adults aged 50–64 and household members of shielded patients. This came alongside research suggesting an increased risk of severe illness and death from co-infection with flu and Covid-19.The seasonal influenza immunisation programme in England aims to protect those who are most at risk of serious illness or death following influenza infection. Here we look at England’s flu vaccine uptake for people aged 65 years and over, as well as how the UK compares internationally.Flu vaccine coverage for older adults Edit How has flu vaccine uptake in people aged 65 and over changed over time? Chart 15/02/2024 Public Health England, Seasonal flu vaccine uptake The ambition for flu vaccine coverage is to reach or exceed 75% uptake for people aged 65 years and over, as recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). In England, between 2004-05 and 2019-20, flu vaccine uptake fluctuated between 71% and 75%. In 2020-21, uptake in people aged 65 years and over reached 81%; this was the first time the WHO target had been met since the winter of 2005-06. In 2021-22, flu vaccine coverage for people aged 65 years and over increased to 82%, the second year in a row that the target had been met. In 2022-23, although coverage fell to 80%, it remained higher than the target, resulting in three consecutive years of flu vaccine coverage at a standard espoused by the WHO.Flu vaccination coverage by country Edit How does the UK's flu vaccination coverage compare internationally? Chart 15/02/2024 OECD, Health Care Utilisation: ImmunisationPublic Health England, Seasonal flu vaccine uptake Between 2007 and 2022, England had some of the highest levels of flu vaccination coverage among those aged 65 and over compared with other OECD countries. In 2022, 80% of registered patients aged 65 and over were immunised. The United States and England have the highest levels of flu vaccine coverage, while Austria, Japan and Germany have the lowest levels of coverage.Since 2018, there has been an increase in flu vaccination coverage among those aged 65 and over in all countries for which data has been reported above, the largest increase for which was observed in Denmark (45% in 2020 to 78% in 2022) and Sweden (52% in 2018 to 70% in 2022). About this dataEngland time series: It is important to note that influenza vaccine uptake data is only a snapshot of the GP registered patients vaccinated at the time of data extraction. Data captured at the time of data extraction will exclude, for example, updates to patient records on vaccination status, newly registered patients or changes in clinical risk status. For example, patients who are vaccinated, but have not had their electronic patient record updated by the time of data extraction, will be included within the denominator, but will not be included in the count of the number vaccinated. For more information, please see the report published by the UK Health Security Agency.OECD data: Influenza vaccination rates refer to the number of people aged 65 and over who have received an annual influenza vaccination, divided by the total number of people over 65 years of age. In some countries, the data includes people over 60 years of age. The main limitation in terms of data comparability arises from the use of different data sources, whether survey or programme, which are susceptible to different types of errors and biases. For example, data from population surveys may reflect some variation due to recall errors and irregularity of administration. The definition and comparability information are taken directly from the OECD report Health at a Glance.

S. Selvavinayagam, director of public health, said in a media report, the joint director of Animal Husbandry, Nellore district, has stated that more than 10,000 poultry birds have died in the district over the past 10 days. They have confirmed an Avian influenza outbreak due to the H5N1 influenza virus, and are taking prevention and control activities, he said.He asked the officials to take up preventive measures, including orientation of Primary Health Centre medical officers and health staff, and training of rapid response teams in coordination with the Animal Husbandry Department.Surveillance of flu like illness in all government and private hospitals should be taken up. Those who had travelled to bird flu affected areas and are engaged in poultry rearing should be looked at. Hospitals should be prepared to handle cases, assist in chemoprophylaxis and sharing of information for action with the Animal Husbandry department. Medical and paramedical teams should be deputed to the check posts as and when requested by the Animal Husbandry department. Death of crows, ducks, chickens and other birds, and sickness in birds noticed by the field staff should be notified immediately to the Joint Director (AH) at the district level. While the availability of an adequate number of personal protective equipment must be ensured, public awareness on hand washing, hygiene practices and wearing of masks by infected persons must be taken up, he said.

The UK is internationally important for seabirds, home to most of the world’s 16,000 pairs of nesting great skuas.Jean Duggan, a policy assistant on avian influenza for the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB), said: “To have that level of loss in a population we have international responsibility for is quite catastrophic.“Globally, it’s very significant and has a knock-on effect for populations across the globe,” she said.The UK also has more than half of the world’s northern gannets, which declined by 25% in the sites surveyed, according to the report by the RSPB, the British Trust for Ornithology and other conservation bodies.View image in fullscreenA great skua chasing a great black-backed gull off Handa Island, north-west Scotland. The collapse in the number of great skuas in the UK has a knock-on effect globally, the RSPB says. Photograph: AlamyGannets nest in a small number of large colonies, which means they are particularly vulnerable to the spread of disease. In Wales, the number of nesting northern gannets crashed by 54%.“For the gannets and great skuas, we knew it was bad, but it’s worse than we thought,” said Duggan.The report also found the virus had caused a 21% decline in the UK population of roseate terns, which is the UK’s rarest breeding seabird, with just one regular nesting colony.Seabirds are typically long-lived animals that do not reach breeding age until they are about five years old. They generally only have a few chicks, so populations take longer to recover from an epidemic such as bird flu.The H5N1 outbreak is thought to have killed millions of wild birds and has most recently been recorded among penguins in the Antarctic. H5N1 is “one of the biggest immediate conservation threats faced by multiple seabird species” across the UK and continental Europe, the report warned.View image in fullscreenA roseate tern on Coquet Island, Northumberland. One of Europe’s rarest seabirds, populations were increasing before bird flu struck. Photograph: Ashley Cooper pics/AlamyPopulations of great skuas, northern gannets and roseate terns were increasing before avian flu struck, so researchers are able to pin the declines on bird flu. Declines in populations of sandwich and common terns – by 35% and 42% respectively – were also likely to be largely driven by bird flu, the report found.In total, nine of the 13 species covered in the report had decreased by more than 10%, but many were already in decline before bird flu so it is not clear to what degree the virus was to blame.Conservationists monitored seabirds for this latest report from May to July 2023. Even more birds died later in the summer, with black-headed gulls, guillemots and kittiwakes particularly badly hit.This meant the impact of bird flu was “likely to be worse than indicated here”, the report warned. “There is also the potential for ongoing impacts as the disease progresses,” researchers wrote.Mass deaths of elephant seals recorded as bird flu sweeps across the AntarcticRead moreThe latest Seabirds Count survey, published last November – which did not take into account the impact of bird flu – found almost 62% of seabirds were already in decline across the UK, driven by unsustainable fishing practices, the climate crisis, offshore windfarms and invasive mammal species.Katie-Jo Luxton, RSPB’s director of conservation, said: “This new study shows that bird flu can be added to the long list of things that are devastating our seabirds.”The RSPB is calling for action to reduce other pressures on seabirds so their populations are more robust and better able to cope with H5N1. Duggan said: “We had the census and now we have this. We need to act now; it’s about building resilience.”In October, scientists confirmed that some wild birds had developed immunity to avian flu. They took blood samples of northern gannets and found that 30% of them had antibodies. About half of shags also had immunity. The sample size was small, and it remains unclear for how long the immunity will last.Explore more on these topicsBird fluThe age of extinctionWildlifeBirdsAnimalsnewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedEnvironmentClimate crisisWildlifeEnergyPollutionNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveTax strategyFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInXNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The study, published in Emerging Infectious Diseases, focusing on the periods 2003 to 2019 and the ongoing 2020 through 2023, the study revealed troubling trends in H5N1 infections, indicating an evolving virus that could pose global risks.Traditionally affecting birds, avian influenza A (H5N1) has shifted since 2003, spreading to mammals and causing panzootic (widespread outbreak among animals) events.advertisementThe current panzootic from 2020-2023 is notably severe, surpassing its 2003 counterpart and raising concerns about its historical impact. Traditionally affecting birds, avian influenza A (H5N1) has shifted since 2003, spreading to mammals and causing panzootic events. (Photo: Getty Images) Early reports on the ongoing panzootic highlight its severity, spreading across four continents and affecting 26 countries.The virus, now infecting various animals like minks, foxes, ferrets, seals, and domestic cats, raises worries about possible transmission to humans.Despite the seriousness of the situation, research on H5N1 remains limited. Understanding the virus's changes becomes crucial for effective policies and preparing for a potential global outbreak. "Continuous surveillance is essential to mitigate the risk for a global pandemic," the authors of the study wrote. Researchers from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) conducted a detailed review, examining literature on natural mammalian H5N1 infections. They focused on infected species, habitats, how the virus spread, and the crucial role of mutations enabling transmission between different species. Despite the seriousness of the situation, research on H5N1 remains limited. (Photo: AFP) The ongoing panzootic is more impactful globally, affecting more countries and posing a serious threat to biodiversity.The emergence of new mutations in H5N1 strains raises concerns about a possible rapid global outbreak, calling for immediate attention and preventive measures.The implications extend beyond animals, reaching into human health, demanding urgent and collective efforts for mitigation and prevention.AVIAN INFLUENZA IN INDIAHighly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI), also called Bird Flu, was first detected in India in the state of Maharashtra in February 2006. Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI), also called Bird Flu, was first detected in India in the state of Maharashtra in February 2006. (Photo: Getty Images) Since then, there have been annual outbreaks of HPAI in different regions of the country, which have led to substantial economic losses. The disease has been reported in 24 states and union territories, resulting in the culling of over 9 million birds to control its spread.India's approach to controlling HPAI follows a "detect and cull" policy as outlined in the National Action Plan for Prevention, Control, and Containment of Avian Influenza (revised - 2021). This comprehensive response includes the humane destruction of infected and exposed animals, eggs, feed, litter, and other contaminated materials. Moreover, actions like limiting the transport of poultry and poultry goods, sanitising and clearing infected locations, and enforcing a Post-Operative Surveillance Plan (POSP) have been put into effect. Besides this, as per the government, in a report released in 2023, vaccination against HPAI is prohibited in India.

In 2022, at least 2,591 great skuas died - 1,400 from one colony alone on Foula island, Shetland.The total number in the UK has declined from 9,088 to 2,160.Ms Duggan highlighted that Britain was pivotal in protecting the bird worldwide because so many breed in Britain. "It's empowering to realise that if we take the right actions in the UK it will actually benefit global populations to a very significant degree," she says.Gannets were also badly affected in 2022, with 11,175 killed in Scotland and an estimated 5,000 mortalities at Grassholm in Wales.In 2023 the total number counted in the UK had declined by 25%, going from 227,129 to 171,048.Avian flu has become less acute in the UK in recent months, but it has caused mass mortalities of birds in other parts of the world. In January it was detected in elephant and fur seals in Antarctica for the first time."While the virus is still present globally, UK birds are still at risk, and the virus will continue to mutate. We need to consider it a long-term threat," says Ms Duggan.Climate change, mortality linked to fishing, the effects of offshore wind developments and a reduction in the availability of food are other threats facing UK sea-birds, according to the RSPB.RSPBRelatedNature reserve helped recovery of bittern species3 days agoPhotographer captures ghostly shadow in the mist25 Oct 2024Hull & East YorkshireNo prosecutions after 89 birds of prey killed in NI23 Oct 2024British Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsUS ElectionSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthVideoLiveAudioWeatherBBC ShopBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoContact technical supportCopyright 2024 BBC.

Of those, 381 fur seals died and 488 sea lions died.The WOAH report included the following statement concerning the past and present HPAI situation: “Data on stranded, ill and dead pinnipeds has been collected on a regular basis and, after evaluation by the official veterinary service, these animals were considered new cases according to clinical epidemiological criteria, providing a more accurate picture of the situation in the region. … In January 2024, only three animals were found dead on the shore of Rio Grande do Sul, with no evidence that the deaths were related to the occurrence of HPAI vírus. During the same period, there were sightings of healthy animals returning to the sea after a period of rest.”Brazil, the world’s largest exporter of chicken, has not had any confirmed cases of HPAI in commercial poultry flocks.HPAI in Brazilian non-poultry birdsOn the same day WOAH released an update on the HPAI situation in Brazilian mammals, it also issued a report on non-poultry birds.The latest case was confirmed on January 29 in a common tern in Itapemirim.Since May 15, 2023, the presence of HPAI has been confirmed in 1,333 wild or domestic non-poultry birds in Brazil. Of those, 369 were classified as domestic birds.

(WLOS) — Two dead ducks found at Lake Louise in Weaverville that were sent for testing were confirmed to be infected with Avian Influenza, Weaverville town officials said Friday, Feb. 16.Weaverville Town Manager Selena Coffey said in a news release Friday the two ducks were sent for testing on Jan. 26.Several viewers reached out to News 13 over the past few months concerned about the amount of ducks that were dying at Lake Louise.In early January, News 13 was told that officials involved with Lake Louise were considering testing the water. At the time, a final decision to do so had not been made, but Coffey said the consideration had nothing to do with wildlife.THREAT OF AVIAN FLU FORCES SUSPENSION OF ALL NC POULTRY SHOWS, PUBLIC SALES (2022)Coffey also told News 13 that there had not been a decline in ducks at the lake and that if any were dying, the more likely solution would be from people feeding the birds, which was strongly discouraged.District 9 Biologist for the N.C. Wildlife Resources Commission Justin McVey said Avian Flu is not a hazard to humans who are around the infected waterfowl or who are in and around the water. However, the disease can be serious and even fatal for domestic poultry, including backyard flocks and other waterfowl.Oftentimes, waterfowl can be infected with Avian Flu and not show signs of illness. They can then carry the disease to new areas through fecal material or oral discharges when migrating.AVIAN FLU OUTBREAK AFFECTS TOP US EGG PRODUCER, MAY TRIGGER PRICE SURGESuspected sick waterfowl or domestic poultry should be reported to the N.C.

Currently, however, doctors across India are reporting not just an extended flu season but also abnormalities in terms of differing symptoms and a quick relapse. In response to the rising influenza infections, in January 2024 , the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) recommended use of the 2024 quadrivalent influenza vaccine that offers protection against two strands of Influenza A and two of Influenza B viruses.

Over the last three months alone, 349,456 birds in Wisconsin have been lost. These numbers don’t begin to reflect what wildlife experts believe to be an unknown tally of wild birds which have perished globally. Perhaps more than 200,000,000 birds, possibly as high as 300 million, of more than 200 species have already died. This might seem particularly doomy and gloomy given our recent celebration of love: Valentine’s Day. However, if we love our birds, and care about our communities, ecosystems, economies, farmers, agricultural workers, and other neighbors, we should take heed of these statistics. During a recent conversation held in the media, a professional cited the 2015 avian influenza outbreak and asked what comparisons might be drawn between the H5N2 virus devastation and response, which, as noted during the conversation, were vastly different in a number of ways from the H5N1 outbreaks recently experienced, as well as risks we are facing now. What was different between the Jefferson County bird flu outbreaks nearly 9 years ago and the 2022 outbreaks in our county? The 2015 outbreaks occurred at three facilities, all within four miles from each other, whereas the distance between the two farms infected by bird flu in 2022 was 20 miles. In the fall of 2015, a Jefferson County public information meeting took place to discuss avian flu and lessons learned. The Jefferson County Land and Water Conservation Department staff as well as the UW Extension/Education agent promoted the event, which included speakers from the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade, and Consumer Protection (DATCP) as well as state of Wisconsin veterinarians. One of the producers whose facility had an outbreak spoke and answered attendees’ questions, in addition to a question-and-answer period with DATCP staff, including DATCP Division of Animal Health Executive Director Melissa Mace. In 2022, no such public information meeting took place. Further, a state of emergency had been declared in 2015, whereas no such state of emergency was declared in 2022. In the summer of 2015, a hearing took place in Washington D.C., sponsored by the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, which was chaired at the time by U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson. U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin served on the committee which heard testimony from a number of people including the aforementioned Jefferson County producer. One of the recommendations made at the hearing was to have high-risk counties and regions start doing biosecurity planning. A link to a transcript of the hearing is here: https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-114shrg21257/html/CHRG-114shrg21257.htm. Information from the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection service, titled: “2022-2024 Confirmations of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza in Commercial and Backyard Flocks,” published last month, is here: https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-2022/2022-hpai-commercial-backyard-flocks. As Jefferson County supervisor representing District 13, I shared this information with our county board chair and county administrator before the March 2022 Palmyra outbreak. I, to the best of my knowledge, do not believe the aforementioned planning efforts have been instituted in Jefferson County or abutting counties, such as Walworth County, which, I believe, have high populations of poultry facilities. You may ask yourself: What are we waiting for? All five of our large scale poultry operations, including most recently the game bird ranch in Ixonia with pheasants and chukars, have already suffered losses during the past nine years. We would like to think, and many of us certainly hope and some pray, it won’t happen again here in Jefferson County. The harsh reality is, more than half a dozen operations in South Dakota have been hit twice, and two are experiencing a third episode. Other states with operations reporting repeated outbreaks include Colorado — a facility with 1,290,966 birds, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, and North Dakota. (Source: FOIA request, USDA/APHIS, obtained by Veterinarian Dr. Crystal Heath, executive director of Our Honor.) Full disclosure here: Some individuals might consider me to be “BFO”: Bird Flu Obsessed. Some time back, I read an article in which the author said people are sometimes considered fanatic or obsessed when they talk too much about bird flu, until, that is, a devastating outbreak occurs in their area, and all bets are pretty much off as to what happens from there. Will nearby backyard flocks or wild birds in the neighboring communities and counties show signs and symptoms? Will other facilities in the county experience disease? Will farm workers become ill while culling the birds? Coming soon: What steps could Jefferson County consider taking now to reduce risks, which would not require new state laws? What are some other countries doing to reduce bird flu risks, which we could perhaps consider emulating?

The animal was found at Wannsee, the Senate Department for Justice and Consumer Protection announced on Friday. The Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut (FLI), which is responsible for animal health, has confirmed that it is the H5N1 subtype. It is the first confirmed case in Berlin this year. There was a similar case in December 2023. At that time, the virus was also discovered in a bean goose. The cold season is typically the peak season for bird flu. However, experts assume that the pathogen is now present in European wild bird populations all year round. At the end of 2022, the zoo had to close for weeks after avian influenza was detected in a waterfowl. Senate Department: do not touch dead animalsThe Senate Department has now appealed to citizens: "Anyone who finds dead waterfowl, ravens or birds of prey should report the find to the responsible veterinary and food inspectorate in the district so that an investigation can be arranged." Sick or dead animals should not be touched under any circumstances and feathers should not be collected. Poultry farmers have been called upon, among other things, to protect their animals from contact with wild birds. Although humans can become infected with the virus in individual cases, human-to-human transmission has not yet been documented.

Joni Ernst demands answers on Biden USDA’s $1M ‘dangerous bird flu experiments’ in China By Josh Christenson Published Feb. 15, 2024 Updated Feb. 15, 2024, 5:28 p.m. ET Sen. Joni Ernst is demanding information about President Biden’s Department of Agriculture spending $1 million in US taxpayer funds on “dangerous bird flu experiments” in cooperation with the Chinese government — and a researcher connected to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, according to a letter exclusively obtained by The Post. Ernst (R-Iowa) wrote to USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack on Wednesday for details about the project, which involves “a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus” and is being conducted “in collaboration” with the UK, the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Wenjun Liu, a researcher “affiliated with the Wuhan Institute of Virology’s Center for Biosafety Mega-Science Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens.” The Biden administration awarded the $1 million grant from April 2021 to March 2026 for “wet-lab virology” experiments involving “strains of avian influenza virus” that “pose the greatest risk to avian or human populations.” 6 Sen. Joni Ernst is demanding information about President Biden’s Department of Agriculture spending $1 million in US taxpayer funds on “dangerous bird flu experiments” in cooperation with the Chinese government. Getty Images The Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing will help with tests to infect vaccinated chickens, mallard ducks, species of Chinese geese and Japanese quail to evaluate the virus’s transmissibility and “potential to jump into mammalian hosts.” Ernst told Vilsack to hand over any departmental information about whether there are any safeguards in place, if the experiments constitute risky gain-of-function research, and what portion is being done in China.

Joni Ernst rips the Pentagon for sending wet and moldy gear to Taiwan, demands answers to ‘embarrassing debacle’ Lawmakers call on FBI to ‘do your job’ and investigate anti-Israel coalition at Columbia University: ‘You have no excuse’ GOP Sen. Joni Ernst demands data on possible Chinese, Russian infiltration of US laboratories: ‘Prime targets for espionage’ Gain-of-function research involves experimentation that aims to increase the transmissibility or virulence of pathogens in order to understand their potential to cause pandemics. “The health and safety of Americans are too important to just wing it, and Biden’s USDA should have had more apprehension before sending any taxpayer dollars to collaborate with the CCP on risky avian flu research,” Ernst told The Post in a statement. “They should know by now to suspect ‘fowl’ play when it comes to researchers who have ties to the dangerous Wuhan Lab, and simply switching from bats to birds causes concern that they are creating more pathogens of pandemic potential,” she added, referring to risky experiments that may have led to the COVID-19 pandemic. 6 The “highly pathogenic avian influenza virus” research is being conducted with the UK and the Chinese Academy of Sciences (above). AFP via Getty Images “Here’s my warning: The Biden administration should be walking on eggshells until they cut off every cent going to our adversaries. We cannot allow what happened in Wuhan to happen again.” Such viral experiments have “already caused outbreaks and killed humans,” Ernst also wrote to Vilsack, noting that “China’s labs have notoriously lax safety standards.” Other bird flu testing will take place at the USDA’s Agricultural Research Service in Athens, Ga., while the University of Edinburgh’s Roslin Institute will complete statistical modeling for the experiments. Federal grant data portals show the award date was Jan. 26, 2021, and $632,813.50 has been doled out so far. 6 Ernst told USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack (above) to hand over any departmental information about whether there are any safeguards in place, if the experiments constitute risky gain-of-function research and what portion is being done in China. REUTERS Performance dates for the 60-month project stretch from April 1, 2021, to March 31, 2026. USDA spokesperson Allan Rodriguez accused Ernst of spreading “misinformation” by not reaching out to the department directly about the research and said the “project was applied for in 2019 and was approved in 2020.” “USDA’s funding is only being committed to the specific components carried out by our own team located in Athens, Georgia, and is not [in] any way contributing to research taking place in the UK or China,” Rodriguez said. “Because animal diseases present a global threat, it is common for international researchers to conduct independent research that’s connected to the same end goal — but what Senator Ernst lays out in her letter is far off base from what’s actually transpiring, and on top of that is based on approval decisions that predate this Administration.” 6 “Here’s my warning: The Biden administration should be walking on eggshells until they cut off every cent going to our adversaries,” Ernst said. “We cannot allow what happened in Wuhan to happen again.” REUTERS Diane Cutler, a former grant fraud investigator for the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General, told The Post it was “disingenuous for USDA to insinuate that its research is separate and is not contributing to the research in China when clearly an official collaboration to conduct this research has been established within USDA’s system of records.” Ernst said the nonprofit taxpayer watchdog group White Coat Waste Project alerted her to the alarming experiments. The group’s senior vice president, Justin Goodman, said Congress should use the upcoming farm bill to cut off funding to “unaccountable animal labs” in China and Russia for good. Last year, a federal government report on National Institutes of Health and US Agency for International Development subgrants found more than $2 million in taxpayer funds flowed to Chinese research institutions in Wuhan. That included more than $1.4 million to the Manhattan-based EcoHealth Alliance, which went on to fund “genetic experiments to combine naturally occurring bat coronaviruses with SARS and MERS viruses, resulting in hybridized (also known as chimeric) coronavirus strains” at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. Former US intelligence officials, the FBI, Energy Department, and scientific experts believe the pandemic most likely began when the virus leaked out of a lab in Wuhan, where research institutions were known to have conducted gain-of-function experiments. 6 Former US intelligence officials, the FBI, the Energy Department, and scientific experts believe the pandemic most likely began when the virus leaked out of a lab in Wuhan, where research institutions were known to have conducted gain-of-function experiments. AFP via Getty Images Rutgers University molecular biologist Dr. Richard Ebright previously told The Post that those experiments violated federal policies governing research on both gain-of-function and enhanced potential pandemic pathogen research. EcoHealth has maintained it never conducted gain-of-function research and that its work in Wuhan has been misrepresented. Ernst and Rep. Mike Gallagher (R-Wis.), who chairs the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, last month demanded a separate investigation by the Pentagon’s inspector general into more than $50 million in defense grants that funded Chinese pandemic research labs. The NIH in October 2021 admitted that EcoHealth had not complied with the terms of its grant to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, and the Department of Health and Human Services two years later barred the lab from US funding for the next 10 years. The White House told The Post on Wednesday that it is being “vigilant” about potentially dangerous scientific research conducted in China after a study from Beijing resulted in a coronavirus variant that killed 100% of “humanized” mice. “We’ve documented in the past over many years concerns about biosafety, biosecurity practices of a number of countries, China being one of them,” White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said in response to The Post’s question about the study during the daily press briefing. 6 Wenju Liu, a researcher connected to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, is named on the grant project proposal. Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences “That’s something we continue to be vigilant about because biosafety and biosecurity, particularly of hazardous bio-substances anywhere in the world, can ultimately come back and harm Americans.” According to Ernst and Gallagher, however, the US is still funding tens of millions of dollars’ worth in viral research abroad. The Department of Defense is currently providing $11 million in grants to EcoHealth to study “viral spillover from wildlife in the Philippines,” “viral spillover biosurveillance in India,” and “high-risk pathogens” in Liberia, among other research.

Trends of the week COVID-19: Decrease in the number of cases and the positivity rate of COVID-19. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV): stabilisation of the number of RSV cases at a low level. Influenza: Decrease in the number of influenza cases. COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 From 5 to 11 February 2024 (week 6), the number of people testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 dropped to 109 cases, compared to 140 cases the previous week (-22%). The positivity rate fell to 4.8% compared to 5.7% the previous week. The viral concentration detected in the wastewater was similar to the previous week [1]. These indicators suggest that the circulation of SARS-CoV-2 is declining. The latest sequencing data available show a preponderance of the JN.1 variant since week 47/2023 [2]. Influenza For the week of 5 to 11 February 2024 (week 6), the number of influenza cases reported by laboratories decreased to 852 cases from 1.020 cases in the previous week, a decrease of 16% compared to the previous week. These data largely coincide with LNS sentinel surveillance, which indicates high circulation of the influenza virus [2]. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) For the week of 5 to 11 February 2024 (week 6), the number of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-positive individuals detected by laboratories rose to 17 cases, compared with 14 cases the previous week. The peak of the epidemic this season was reached in week 50, from 11 to 17 December 2023.

The confirmation of H5N1, a subtype of the influenza A virus, was reported in Chagatla and Gummalladibba poultry farms situated in Podalakuru and Kovur mandals of Nellore district.Responding to the situation, a meeting was convened by the District Collector, urging officials to take immediate preventive measures in the affected areas. The poultry industry, established in 1978 in the district, predominantly operates in Buchireddypalem, Venkatachalam, Kovur, Patur, Kothur, Narukur, Allipuram, Venkatachalam, and Kothur areas.District Collector M. Hari Narayana has directed officials to enforce stringent measures to curb the spread of avian influenza (bird flu) within the district.Samples have been sent to National Institute of High-Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD), Bhopal, which confirmed the presence of avian influenza. Officials have ordered to closure of chicken shops for three days within a ten-kilometer radius of the affected areas. Chicken shops will also remain closed for three-months within a one-kilometer radius. Additionally, movement of chickens out of the infected area is restricted for 15 days, and new chickens are not to be brought in from other areas.Follow The New Indian Express channel on WhatsApp Download the TNIE app to stay with us and follow the latestBird fluShow CommentsRelated StoriesNo stories found.

Roughly a week later, growers said the company suddenly informed them the birds would have to be euthanized because it didn't have the means to pick up or process them."I got a call from the live production manager at that point and time—I think it was around 7 o'clock that night—stating that the state would be coming in the next day to depopulate my birds. No reason why," Harp said.Cooks Venture asked the Arkansas Department of Agriculture to euthanize the chickens. The department said the company's request was due to avian influenza concerns in the region.Poultry growers for Cooks Venture told KATV that, after chickens were euthanized, the state said Cooks Venture would handle their disposal, but the company only arranged clean up for three farmers, leaving the vast majority with chicken houses full of the company's dead birds."I was devastated because those were our livelihood to keep the farm running and a way of life. So now we have no job and a pile of chickens they said they would clean up but still have not," said Carroll County poultry grower Darren Swofford.What's more, poultry growers said their flocks were euthanized even when they didn't test positive for avian influenza and in spite of the fact that some growers had enough resources to keep them alive."[Cooks Venture] called November 28 and said 'shut off the feed,' so I asked if there was anything to stop this from happening and got a fast 'no,'" Swofford said. Harps also said she had would have had enough feed to maintain her flock."I do think the state should have ran down some different avenues before they just came in here and depopulated the birds and just took Cooks at their word," Harp said. "I think maybe they should have handled that on a farm-by-farm basis."Beyond that, farmers say that Cooks Venture has failed to pay them for their services. Harp says the company has only paid her $3,800 out of the $35,000 owed to her. Dustin Maybee, a Carroll County poultry grower, says the company still owes him $42,000."I've got a propane bill and a power bill sitting on my desk that I can't pay...if you can't get paid for what you've already done, what is a person supposed to do...it's absolutely devastating," Maybee said.Maybee had about 70,000 chickens on his farm. He says when state workers came out to euthanize his flocks, they took issue with him recording the proceedings with a GoPro and refused to continue."Tried to get me to sign a piece of paper, telling me that my farm was on quarantine now and that they was gonna leave," Maybee said.Maybee, who said his flocks did not test positive for bird flu, says state employees left and didn't come back to euthanize his birds until six days later, by which time he had run out of feed—usually supplied by Cooks Venture—and his flocks had begun starving and eating each other.Swofford also described an unpleasant experience he had with state crews when they came to his farm to euthanize his birds."...flew in through my gates...about six or seven vehicles, 15 or so men. I met them at the chicken houses and started asking questions and they said get back and shut up we are here to do our jobs...next came a tanker truck with water and they set up a makeshift pool to add to the chemicals they were going to spray the birds with. I asked if they had any safety data sheets on the chemicals they was spraying and got a no. So, they pretty much pushed all my birds to the front of the chicken houses and sprayed them with foam," Swofford said.Among the most vocal in condemning the Department of Agriculture and Patrick Fisk, director of its Livestock and Poultry Division, is State Sen. Bryan King (R, District 28), himself a poultry grower."We have laws for avian influenza...where you can go in and depopulate. This situation was, these chickens did not test positive [for avian influenza]. I mean, this is reminiscent of a communist country. I mean, it really is—where the landowner in that had no rights in this thing," King said. "And Mr. Fisk, as he's repeatedly said, acted on behalf of the company. And unfortunately, the taxpayers are paying for this."King has gone as far as to call for Fisk and Arkansas Agriculture Secretary Wes Ward to resign over the Cooks Venture debacle.In December, King requested that the state declare an emergency and compensate affected poultry growers. After the request was denied by Ward, King announced his intention to secure compensation for growers at April's fiscal session.In the meantime, Maybee, Harp, and other poultry growers are pursuing litigation against Cooks Venture.The Department of Agriculture did not agree to an interview with KATV, but did provide four letters and documents concerning the aftermath of Cooks Venture's closing.Stay ConnectedLike UsFollow Ussbg-envelopeNewsletter Sign up /sign-up© 2024 Sinclair, Inc.TermsEEOFCCFCCPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesLoading ...Flu cases spike late in season across St. Louis area Skip to content FOX 2 St. Louis 49° Sign Up St. Louis 49° Sponsored By Toggle Menu Open Navigation Close Navigation Search Please enter a search term.

Missouri Flu cases spike late in season across St. Louis area by: Max Diekneite Posted: Feb 12, 2024 / 09:46 PM CST Updated: Feb 12, 2024 / 09:46 PM CST by: Max Diekneite Posted: Feb 12, 2024 / 09:46 PM CST Updated: Feb 12, 2024 / 09:46 PM CST SHARE This is an archived article and the information in the article may be outdated. Please look at the time stamp on the story to see when it was last updated. ST. LOUIS – A late-season peak in respiratory illnesses is affecting schools and families across the St. Louis area. Flu cases, in particular, have spiked as of late. Missouri Baptist Medical Center pediatrician Joel Koenig said while the late peak is unusual, the problem itself is unfortunately unavoidable. “If you want to have a 100% safe school environment where you’ll never catch germs, you’re dreaming,” Koenig said. “It’s never going to happen.” Koenig saw the late surge in flu cases start two weeks ago. His office was seeing two to three flu cases per week. Now, he’s seeing that many every day. But he said there are things you can do to limit the damage. The big one? You’ve likely heard it before. “Wash your hands!” Koenig said. “So, it turned out with COVID, handwashing didn’t make much of a difference; it was more about masking up. But with flu and other respiratory viruses, it’s more about handwashing.” St. Louis Cardinals secure new TV deal: What to know and what’s next? Koenig hasn’t seen many kids with COVID-19. He has had to send two young children to the hospital with symptoms of RSV, but the flu is the most common illness right now. He added that you should seek care if your symptoms are getting worse or if you have complications from the flu, such as a sinus or ear infection. Koenig’s office has seen one other, rather strange flu side effect. “This year, I’ve seen a few kids with an unusual one called myositis, where their calf muscles hurt so bad that they can’t walk,” he said. “It’s like you had a mean coach that made you run around the trees one time too many.” Koenig recommends doing in-person visits for flu cases rather than virtual as it’s more difficult to diagnose through a screen. Anyone who is having severe difficulty breathing should go straight to the emergency room. Although it’s late in the season, Koenig still recommends to go ahead and get the influenza vaccine if you haven’t already.

Doctors say they continue to see people with symptoms of cold, cough, headache, fever and fatigue caused by viruses in the city. In most cases, people recover with rest and medication, but some senior citizens with co-morbid conditions are getting admitted to hospitals, doctors say.âWe see a thick and elongated tail in the flu graph this year,â said Dr V Ramasubramanian, Apollo Hospitals infectious diseases expert. âIt peaked in mid-Sept with an increase in Covid cases, respiratory infections, and influenza cases including H1N1 and H3N2,â he said.The symptoms including cold, soreness in the throat, and fever settle in five days to a week. âIn the out-patient unit, we see cough and fatigue in some patients for up to 20 days,â said Kilpauk Medical College Hospital head of general medicine Dr P Paranthaman. We donât know if there is a new variant. At the hospital, once illnesses such as Covid-19, malaria, or dengue are ruled out, we usually prescribe medicines based on symptoms because viral panels are expensive. Also, in most cases it doesnât help patients directly as there is no medication course for viral infections,â he said.The state public health laboratory, which screens samples said it hasnât identified new strains so far. âIn most cases, tests turn out negative although people have flu-like symptoms,â said S Raju, who heads the state laboratory.Doctors say, the infection seems to spread rapidly. In several cases, children bring the infection into houses and adults take them to workplaces. âPeople tell us everyone in their office has a cold. While itâs okay for healthy individuals, elderly people and those with chronic ailments must be careful,â said Gleneagles Global Hospitals infectious diseases expert Dr S Subramanian.âWe advise people to rest at home if they have symptoms. Those going out must wear masks and maintain social distancing,â said DPH Dr T S Selvavinayagam.We also published the following articles recentlyHave Cold, Cough, Fever Or Rashes?

The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) told Global News it is responding to the presence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), subtype H5N1, in small flocks and commercial and non-commercial farms with birds across Canada.Since the beginning of the fall migration period in September 2023, an estimated 3,358,547 birds in flocks have been impacted by avian flu, Dr. Cathy Furness, deputy chief veterinary officer at the CFIA, said in an email Friday. This does not include wild birds.“The current global avian influenza outbreak has been unprecedented,” she said, adding that other countries are also grappling with the spread. 4:25 Avian flu raises concerns of another Christmas turkey shortage Typically, the CFIA responds to avian flu outbreaks on a seasonal basis, during bird migratory periods in spring and fall. Story continues below advertisement “The ongoing response is unique in the number of detections, the geographical distribution of outbreaks and its long duration, which has extended beyond typical migratory periods,” Furness said.Avian influenza can infect multiple species of domestic chickens, turkeys, quails and guinea fowl as well as wild and pet birds, according to the CFIA.

The turkey industry was one of the hardest hit by the avian flu in 2022, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada says, and that disrupted holiday supply in the country that year. What are the risks of avian flu? Avian flu can impact both the poultry industry and wildlife.In Kingston, Ont., avian flu killed roughly 30 Canada geese that were found along the Lake Ontario Park waterfront earlier this month. Story continues below advertisement The virus was also confirmed in dead Canada geese in Belleville, Ont., public health officials said on Monday.So far this year, more than 200 Canada geese as well as gulls, crows and a Bald Eagle have been found sick or dead from HPAI in southern Ontario, according to Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC). Most of these cases – roughly 150 – have been detected in the Kingston area, said Hannah Boonstra, a spokesperson for ECCC.This number however is much lower than the “significant mass mortality” in Canada geese and swans in southern Ontario that was reported in March 2023, she said. Trending Now How Canadian consumers can spot counterfeit $2 coins One person is dead and 16 are injured after a shooting at Tuskegee University “The number of reported sick or dead birds has now slowed, suggesting that the current outbreaks are largely over, but it is possible that we will see additional mortality in Ontario as we progress into the spring,” Boonstra told Global News in an email Friday. 1:55 Why avian flu spread has some experts cautioning need for human vaccine The virus is spread through contact with an infected bird or poultry products. Although rare, humans and non-avian species can also get infected. Story continues below advertisement In Canada, there have also been some sporadic bird flu cases detected in raccoons, striped skunks, red foxes, cats and dogs.However, avian flu does not pose a food safety concern, the CFIA says.“There is no evidence to suggest that eating cooked poultry or eggs could transmit HPAI to humans,” the agency states on its website.To keep the virus in check, the CFIA, in collaboration with the industry, has surveillance programs in place that target wild birds and domestic flocks.Biosecurity measures involve maintaining good hygiene practices and limiting exposure to external sources of contamination, the agency says.“The continued detections of HPAI in both wild and domestic birds in Canada is a strong reminder for anyone raising birds to remain vigilant of HPAI and ensure they have effective biosecurity measures in place,” Furness said.Canada has also placed restrictions on imports of poultry, poultry products and live birds from other countries affected by a bird flu outbreak.

File | Photo Credit: The Hindu Tamil Nadu ended 2023 with 3,544 cases of H1N1; the highest number of seasonal influenza cases in almost 14 years, data from the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has shown.Health officials said that influenza cases had surged during the second half of 2023, and had settled to an extent now. According to the NCDC website, there were 3,544 H1N1 cases and 19 deaths in 2023 in the State. The last time it recorded over 3,000 cases was in 2017 when there were 3,315 cases and 17 deaths.Senior doctors in the major government hospitals in Chennai said they were not seeing persons with symptoms of influenza now. “Testing for H1N1 is done when we have clinically-strong suspicions. We did see patients with fever, pneumonia and acute breathlessness during the latter half of 2023,” a government physician said. Suresh Kumar, consultant, Infectious Diseases, Apollo Hospitals, said persons with symptoms of H1N1 were still seen at the hospital. “We see patients with symptoms of fever, cold and cough for whom we provide symptomatic treatment, while we give Oseltamivir tablets as outpatient treatment for those with risk factors. We cannot test for influenza in an outpatient setting. But among those admitted for fever or symptoms of pneumonia in the wards or even in the intensive care unit, we find persons testing positive for H1N1. Some persons aged above 60 years and having co-morbidities were admitted and required minimal oxygen support,” he said.“In the last two to three years, we did not think much about H1N1 due to COVID-19. But we definitely saw more influenza cases in 2023 than in 2022, while COVID-19 dominated 2021,” he added. Vijayalakshmi Balakrishnan, senior consultant, Infectious Diseases, Kauvery Hospital, said the last two flu seasons were very bad. “We had cases of H1N1 and then H3N2. In the last one month, we saw more influenza B virus infections than H1N1 cases. But the numbers have gone down dramatically in the last one week to 10 days probably because the summer is starting to set in. Last year, we saw cases till March and April but we hope that the cases are decreasing earlier this year,” she said. Dr. Suresh Kumar said it was better to test persons aged above 60 years and those who had co-morbidities if they experienced symptoms of fever, cold and cough. “This will enable us to know the prevalence as well,” he said. Officials said that as per existing guidelines, testing for H1N1 was done for Category C patients (those having certain symptoms and signs along with one or more of the following that includes breathlessness, chest pain, drowsiness, fall in blood pressure, sputum in blood in adults and flu like illness plus somnolence, high and persistent fever, inability to feed well, convulsions and shortness of breath in children) and worsening of underlying chronic conditions. A health official said there was no need to panic. “We have protocols and sufficient consumables including drugs,” he said.

The outbreak at Whitianga Care Centre and Village was reported to Te Whatu Ora on 28 January, and the health agency said there has been no further spread since last Friday. Oceania Healthcare runs the facility which has 48 residents and 29 staff on site. Its group general manager for sales and services Anita Hawthorn told RNZ's Midday Report that 17 residents were infected and eight staff members. The first resident who fell ill with with symptoms was infectious at the centre for two days before they started deteriorating, Hawthorn said, and was taken to Thames Hospital where it was confirmed they had Influenza A. She said the site introduced full infectious disease control protocols once Influenza A was identified, including deep cleaning, placing all infected residents in isolation, and requiring staff and visitors to wear personal protective equipment (PPE). Hawthorn said one resident died in hospital, one died at home, and four died at the centre. Age Concern's chief executive Kevin Lamb said the outbreak in Whitianga's rest home was a reminder for people to protect themselves and vulnerable people from influenza. Lamb said it was concerning that people were getting complacent after years of Covid-19 restrictions. People had been taking severe measures to protect themselves but it was now just accepted as part of life. "I think almost we've allowed that complacency to seep in, and we forget that we're not out of the woods with Covid completely," he said. "And we know influenza and different strains of influenza will come about every single year, and we need to ensure that we're protecting ourselves and that we're not falling into that complacency trap and that we're getting our vaccinations regularly." University of Otago epidemiologist Professor Michael Baker said the rest home setting was high risk for influenza outbreaks. "Once a virus gets into that population, you've got a lot of vulnerable people living in close confines so the virus can spread very rapidly," he said. "A critical thing is to make sure as best we can stop people who are symptomatic, with any respiratory infections, as staff or visitors going into these facilities, because that's what starts these outbreaks." Professor Baker said there was low level transmission of influenza every day of the year, but at the moment there was the added factor of people coming in from the northern hemisphere where flu was intense at the moment. He said vaccines taken at the end of last year might not provide protection for the virus coming from overseas right now. Baker said the combined deaths from Covid-19 and influenza last year accounted for 5 percent of all deaths in New Zealand.

(Shutterstock)Social SharingCOVID-19 and the flu have each killed two more New Brunswickers and hospitalized a combined total of 34 people, including four youths, updated figures from the province show.COVID activity remains moderate and flu activity remains stable, according to Tuesday's Respiratory Watch report, which covers Jan. 28 to Feb. 3.All four people who died were aged 65 or older.The latest COVID deaths raise the pandemic death toll to at least 1,009. The actual total is unclear because the province has counted only people who die in hospital as COVID deaths since September.Twenty-two people were hospitalized for or with COVID during the reporting week, down from 36 in the previous report.Five required intensive care, up from one.A child under four is among those hospitalized. The others include one person aged 20 to 44, four aged 45 to 64, and 16 aged 65 or older.The person aged 20 to 44 is the youngest of the five admitted to ICU.8 outbreaks, 3 at nursing homesThere were eight lab-confirmed COVID outbreaks, down from 10, including three in nursing homes and five in "other facilities." These raise the total number of outbreaks since the respiratory season began on Aug. 27 to 306.Eighty-six new cases of COVID have been confirmed through PCR (polymerase chain reaction) lab tests, up from 83.The Moncton region saw the majority of the 86 COVID-19 and 102 flu cases between Jan. 28 and Feb. 3, with 44 and 33 cases, respectively, the Respiratory Watch report shows. (CBC)The actual number of cases is likely higher because only people with a referral from a health-care provider, and for whom the result will directly influence their treatment or care, have been able to get a PCR test since April, and the province stopped reporting positive rapid test results in September.The positivity rate — the percentage of PCR lab tests performed that produced a positive result — remains unchanged again at seven per centNearly 1,600 more New Brunswickers received the updated COVID XBB.1.5 vaccine in the past week, according to figures from the Department of Health. A total of 141,824 shots have now been administered since Oct. 4.50% jump in confirmed flu casesFlu sent 12 people to hospital during the reporting week, none of whom required intensive care — identical numbers to the previous week.Three youths aged five to 19 are among those admitted to hospital. There are also three people aged 45 to 64, and six aged 65 or older.Two outbreaks have been confirmed through lab tests. There were no outbreaks reported the previous week.The number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 and flu in New Brunswick by week, between the start of the respiratory season on Aug. 27, 2023, and Feb. 3, 2024, compared to the historical cases.

No information about the schools affected or the extent of the outbreaks has been released.School outbreaks are based on 10 per cent absenteeism in a school because of influenza-like illness symptoms, the report says.New lab-confirmed flu cases jumped to 102 from 68 in a week — a 50 per cent increase.The positivity rate increased to nine per cent, from seven.The breakdown of the new cases includes 83 influenza A and 19 influenza B.The respiratory seasonal total now stands at 2,321 cases.More than 3,000 flu shots were administered in the past week, figures from the Department of Health show.

While the department is taking prevention and control activities, the DPH has issued the guidelines for Avian influenza to the Deputy Directors of Health Services, Tiruvallur, Ranipet, Vellore, Tirupathur and Krishnagiri.The guidelines state that Avian influenza is a viral disease, primarily affecting the poultry with a potential to cause human infections. Infected poultry and wild birds can transmit the virus to susceptible poultry and human beings through contaminated poultry products, secretions, excretions or carcasses, etc.The infected birds or persons will develop FLU like illness characterized by fever, headache, myalgia, cough and shortness breath etc.There is no chemoprophylaxis required for healthcare workers or persons handling birds with PPE or contact with a sick person, and they remain low risk contact. Persons handling sick birds or who are in direct exposure to sick or dead birds infected with Avian influenza have a moderate risk. Individuals sharing household with or caring for a patient or in unprotected close contact with patient at less than 1 metre distance are at a high risk. The moderate and high risk individuals should be treated with Oseltamivir 75 mg once daily for 7-10 days.DPH has also instructed the Deputy Director of Health Services in districts bordering Andhra Pradesh to undertake orientation of the PHC medical officers and health staff and conduct training of the Rapid Response Team in co-ordination with Animal Husbandry Department.The surveillance of flu like illness in all government and private hospitals has to be intensified, especially those who had travelled to bird flu affected areas and engaged in poultry rearing.DDHS have been asked to work in close co-ordination with Animal Husbandry Department and the District Administration and depute medical and para medical teams for each check post as and when requested by the Animal Husbandry Department.The officials have also been asked to notify death of crows, ducks, chickens and other birds and sickness in birds noticed by the field staff should be to the Joint Director. Besides supervision, the availability of adequate quantities of Personal Protective Equipment and Oseltamivir capsule is also to be ensured.Tamil NaduDirector of Public Health and Preventive Medicine (DPH)Avian Influenza preventionAvian Influenza outbreakH5N1 Influenza virusinfected birdsDTNEXT Bureau Next StoryRelated ArticlesMost Read About Us Contact Us Privacy Policy Terms of Use Subscription © Copyright | Powered by HocalwireXFlu season potentially waning, and more respiratory virus news for this week - The Globe and Mail Skip to main contentSearchNewslettersWatchlistHomeWatchlistFor YouCanadaWorldBusinessInvestingPersonal FinanceOpinionPoliticsSportsLifeArtsDriveReal EstateLatest in SubscribeDigital accessDigital + home deliveryFlu season potentially waning, and more respiratory virus news for this weekFlu season potentially waning, and more respiratory virus news for this weekKelly GrantHealth reporterPublished February 13, 2024This article was published more than 6 months ago.

While Canadians learned a lot about how to protect themselves from illness over the course of the pandemic, new information released by health care practitioners can help inform decisions, from availability of flu shots to any changes in COVID protocols.We’ll be publishing an update on respiratory virus season each week. Looking for more information on the topic that you don’t see here? E-mail audience@globeandmail.com to see if we can help you.The latest newsInfluenza continues to loosen its grip on Canada. The latest FluWatch report from the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) shows flu activity levels as of the week ended Feb. 3 were similar to the week before, and were either within or below expected levels for this point in the season. Both influenza A and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) appear to have peaked in late December.COVID-19 activity levels are stable or decreasing in Canada, according to PHAC. Wastewater testing, which looks for evidence of the virus in sewage, shows either no change or a decrease in the viral signal at most testing sites in the country. The number of Canadians in hospital with COVID-19 is also holding steady at around 3,500, which is down from highs of nearly 4,600 in late November.Flu shotsFlu shots are still available across the country, and experts say it’s not too late to get one. Appointments are available for anyone six months or older. Find out about clinics and availability for each of the provinces and territories here:Newfoundland; Prince Edward Island; Nova Scotia; New Brunswick; Quebec; Ontario; Manitoba; Saskatchewan; Alberta; British Columbia; Yukon; Northwest Territories; NunavutCOVID boostersThe three authorized vaccines, manufactured by Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Novavax, protect against the XBB.1.5 subvariant of COVID-19 and should provide good protection against the related EG.5 family. The reformulated mRNA shots from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna are approved for anyone six months or older. Novavax’s shot is approved for those 12 and up.COVID-19 vaccine information for the provinces and territories can be found here:Newfoundland; Prince Edward Island; Nova Scotia; New Brunswick; Quebec; Ontario; Manitoba; Saskatchewan; Alberta; British Columbia; Yukon; Northwest Territories; NunavutFlu outlook in CanadaIn the week ended Feb. 3, the proportion of tests for influenza that came back positive was 12.5 per cent. This percentage, known as the positivity rate, has been holding steady for four weeks now, according to PHAC, and is below historical averages for this time of year. Most cases identified so far this season have been influenza A (H1N1), but the number of cases of influenza B – which often peaks in spring – has begun to climb.There were 74 people admitted to hospital with the flu in the week ended Feb. 3, including nine sent to intensive-care units. Since the start of influenza season, 3,523 people have been admitted to hospital with the virus.Hospitalization for COVID-19The number of people in hospital with COVID-19 across Canada was 3,549 in the week ended Feb. 6, nearly unchanged from 3,546 the week before.Current health guidance for COVID-19Symptoms of COVID-19 can vary, but generally include sore throat, runny nose, sneezing, new or worsening cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, feeling feverish, chills, fatigue or weakness, muscle or body aches, new loss of smell or taste, headache, abdominal pain and diarrhea. According to Health Canada, people may start experiencing symptoms anywhere from one to 14 days after exposure. Typically, symptoms appear between three to seven days after exposure.If you have symptoms or have been exposed to a person with COVID-19, Health Canada advises following the testing guidelines provided by your local public health authority. If you test positive, immediately isolate yourself from others, including those in your household, and follow the advice of your local public health authority on isolation requirements.How to protect yourself and your loved ones from respiratory virusesRespiratory viruses are spread from person to person or through contact with contaminated surfaces, so it’s important to protect against both forms of transmission. Health Canada recommends wearing a medical mask or respirator, washing your hands regularly or using hand sanitizer, covering your coughs and sneezes, and cleaning and disinfecting high-touch surfaces and objects. If you feel sick, stay home and limit contact with others.Please enable JavaScript to view this content.Report an editorial errorReport a technical issueEditorial code of conductRelated storiesB.C. launches spring COVID-19 booster program, targeting vulnerable and unvaccinated‘Like 35-year-old woman in the body of a 70-year-old lady’: Four years into the pandemic, Canadians with long COVID are still strugglingCanadian Covid Society launches to address long-term effects, prevent further illnessB.C. launches spring COVID-19 booster program, targeting vulnerable and unvaccinated‘Like 35-year-old woman in the body of a 70-year-old lady’: Four years into the pandemic, Canadians with long COVID are still strugglingCanadian Covid Society launches to address long-term effects, prevent further illnessFollow related authors and topicsKelly GrantFlu, COVID, RSV and ColdsPublic Health (Canada)Authors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following.Interact with The GlobeTerms & ConditionsCommunity GuidelinesPrivacy PolicyDisclaimerSkip footer navigationSubscribeDigital + Home DeliveryDigital AccessGlobe2GoThe New York TimesGlobe Email NewslettersGift SubscriptionBusiness servicesAdvertise with UsGroup SubscriptionsGlobe CampusDataStoreGlobe Event CentreLeadership InstituteContact usAddress and Phone NumberStandards EditorStaffSecureDropSubmit an articleReader servicesAccount SettingsTechnical Support & FAQsSubscriptionsManage my privacy preferencesManage my advertising preferencesMember BenefitsAbout usCompany InformationWork at The GlobeAccessibilityEditorial Code of ConductSustainabilityLicensing & PermissionsElection Advertising RegistryModern Slavery ReportSubscribeDigital + Home DeliveryDigital AccessGlobe2GoThe New York TimesGlobe Email NewslettersGift SubscriptionBusiness servicesAdvertise with UsGroup SubscriptionsGlobe CampusDataStoreGlobe Event CentreLeadership InstituteContact usAddress and Phone NumberStandards EditorStaffSecureDropSubmit an articleReader servicesAccount SettingsTechnical Support & FAQsSubscriptionsManage my privacy preferencesManage my advertising preferencesMember BenefitsAbout usCompany InformationWork at The GlobeAccessibilityEditorial Code of ConductSustainabilityLicensing & PermissionsElection Advertising RegistryModern Slavery ReportReturn to start of footer navigation© Copyright 2024 The Globe and Mail Inc.

Delhi-NCR Sees Spike in Cases of High Fever Among ChildrenReported By : Himani ChandnaNews18.comEdited By:Apoorva MisraLast Updated:February 14, 2024, 10:06 ISTFluctuating temperatures during the transition from cold to warm weather are believed to be the main cause of the surge in viral infections, with a suspected new flu variant contributing to the increaseFollow us on Google NewsAccording to medical experts, practising hand washing and wearing masks in crowded public places can help to prevent the spread of these infections. (Getty)Delhi-NCR has been witnessing a surge in cases of high fever among children, mainly due to fluctuating weather conditions because of the transition from cold to warm season.Paediatricians are seeing a high influx of admissions and visits to outpatient departments (OPDs) as anxious parents bring in their children, often with high fevers exceeding 101, at times hitting as high as 104.5 degrees Fahrenheit.According to Dr RD Srivastava, head of the department, paediatric medicine and neonatology at New Delhi-based Sri Balaji Action Medical Institute, the surge in cases of viral fever among children is “concerning".“With daily reports of 15-20 cases in the outpatient department and five to eight admissions, our young ones are facing challenging situations owing to fluctuating weather conditions."Srivastava indicated that he has been seeing children reporting fever as high as 104.5 in some cases. Other doctors echoed similar trends. Dr Veena Raghunathan, senior consultant, paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) at Amrita Hospital in Faridabad, has noted that every seven out of 10 kids coming to her hospital are suffering from such symptoms these days.“Patients have been coming in with typically high temperatures exceeding 101 F, runny nose, throat pain, headache and dry cough. Parents are distraught as the fever shows only temporary or partial relief to paracetamol." Dr Praveen Makhija, principal consultant of paediatrics at Max Smart Super Speciality Hospital in Saket, also confirmed the trend. “I have been seeing around 10-12 cases every day," he said, adding that parents need not be worried if a child is active and playful once the fever comes down. However, they must consult a medical expert if a child is dull and inactive. “If the child is not eating well, hospitalisation is needed," he advised. New flu variant or influenza virus?Experts believe that the changing weather and rising pollution levels worsen viral infections, creating an ideal environment for their spread. “Fluctuating temperatures due to transition in weather from cold to warm seem to be the main reason behind the increase in viral infections," Raghunathan said, sharing her experience that during peak winter, “a lot of infants and young children were affected with respiratory syncytial virus this year, but this is on the decline now".She believes that the current surge appears to be due to a “new flu variant". Moreover, experts believe that the unpredictable weather conditions and air pollution are exaggerating allergies and asthma in children and increasing the likelihood of infections. Dr Dinesh Raj, paediatrician at Holy Family Hospital in Delhi, has also been seeing many such patients with acute onset high-grade fever along with respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms. “Most of these are viral and turning out to be influenza. We are not testing routinely in outpatients for influenza as it is not indicated. But patients who are sick need to be tested," Raj added. What to do?According to medical experts, practising hand washing and wearing masks in crowded public places can help to prevent the spread of these infections. Children who are already suffering must get adequate rest and drink plenty of liquids to avoid dehydration. “In viral fever, treatment is essentially supportive care," Raj from Holy Family Hospital said. “We encourage bed rest and a lot of fluid intake. Paracetamol is given for fever. Ibuprofen can be given on a case-to-case basis. But hydration needs to be ensured as Ibuprofen is known to affect kidneys." Doctors stressed on avoiding unnecessary consumption of other medicines except paracetamol unless prescribed by a medical practitioner. “Paracetamol should be used in correct doses to treat fever. It is the safest medicine," Makhija said, adding that parents should refrain from self-medicating children with doses of mefenamic acid or ibuprofen. “They must give these medicines only under the doctor’s supervision." Doctors suggest that sponging with lukewarm water also helps to control fever, especially in small children. Also, in case of high fever, parents must try to make the child comfortable and avoid ‘over clothing’.tags :dry coughfluhigh feverinfluenzanews18 specialsparacetamolLocation : New Delhi, IndiaFirst Published:February 14, 2024, 10:06 ISTNews india New Flu Variant or Influenza?

Video / NZ Herald / Mark Mitchell / GettyThe deaths of six residents in a Coromandel rest home highlights how “devastating” influenza outbreaks can be in aged care facilities — and why vigilance is always needed to keep the virus out of them, a top epidemiologist says.The six deaths occurred within two weeks after the virus — identified as influenza A — was first detected at Whitianga Care Centre and Village, on January 28.Anita Hawthorne, group general manager for sales and services with facility owner Oceania Healthcare, said procedures were in place for such outbreaks.The centre had worked closely with Te Whatu Ora and followed all infection control procedures, she said, including deep cleaning, isolating those with symptoms and wearing full PPE.An Oceanic spokesperson told Coromandel’s CFM that six of 44 residents had died with flu symptoms during the period, while many staff, too, had contracted the virus.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Otago University epidemiologist Professor Michael Baker said the tragic case showed the risk influenza posed to such environments, even outside flu season.“Once the virus gets into that environment, there will often be fatalities — that’s just because of the nature of the vulnerable population there, but also the living environment,” he said.“The big message is that people who have symptoms should not go to rest homes because once the virus is in there, it’s very hard to contain.”AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Though Covid-19 had now become New Zealand’s No 1 infectious-disease killer, flu remained a major burden — accounting for about 2 per cent of deaths annually.After sweeping back into the country in 2022 to cause the biggest peak in cases observed in a decade, last year’s flu season was marked by its consistent activity and earlier kick-off.That was partly due to the return of two strains that had been largely absent since before the pandemic: influenza B and A(H1N1) or “swine flu”, which were known to hit children and the elderly hard respectively.ESR surveillance showed that, as of mid-December, influenza A accounted for about half of positive flu samples analysed by labs — with more than 3000 of those confirmed as A(H1N1).However, there weren’t any indications that New Zealand was experiencing a summer surge in flu in tandem with a gradually receding Covid-19 wave.Royal New Zealand College of General Practitioners medical director Dr Luke Bradford said GP clinics were seeing a traditionally lower level of flu cases right now.“The Whitianga outbreak is just a reminder that the flu never leaves completely — it just goes through waves where it becomes more prevalent.”Jamie Morton is a specialist in science and environmental reporting. He joined the Herald in 2011 and writes about everything from conservation and climate change to natural hazards and new technology.SaveShareShare this articleCopy LinkEmailFacebookTwitter/XLinkedInRedditLatest from New ZealandNew ZealandUpdatedEmergency services responding to fire in Auckland suburb of Ōtara12 Nov 04:37 AMPolitics'Put your money where you mouth is': Redress questions remain unanswered for survivors amid abuse apology12 Nov 04:26 AMNew ZealandUpdatedCouple's surprise: Tairāwhiti volunteers win Nan Evans award12 Nov 04:22 AMSponsored: Make sure your valuables are coveredsponsoredAdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Latest from New ZealandEmergency services responding to fire in Auckland suburb of Ōtara12 Nov 04:37 AMDark smoke can be seen pouring from the burning property.'Put your money where you mouth is': Redress questions remain unanswered for survivors amid abuse apology12 Nov 04:26 AMCouple's surprise: Tairāwhiti volunteers win Nan Evans award12 Nov 04:22 AMAbuse survivor speaks after Government apologysponsoredOtago pinot leads NZ wine resurgenceNZ HeraldAbout NZ HeraldMeet the journalistsNewslettersClassifiedsHelp & supportContact usHouse rulesPrivacy PolicyTerms of useCompetition terms & conditionsOur use of AISubscriber ServicesNZ Herald e-editionsDaily puzzles & quizzesManage your digital subscriptionManage your print subscriptionSubscribe to the NZ Herald newspaperSubscribe to Herald PremiumGift a subscriptionSubscriber FAQsSubscription terms & conditionsPromotions and subscriber benefitsNZME NetworkThe New Zealand HeraldThe Northland AgeThe Northern AdvocateWaikato HeraldBay of Plenty TimesRotorua Daily PostHawke's Bay TodayWhanganui ChronicleVivaNZ ListenerWhat the ActualNewstalk ZBBusinessDeskOneRoofDriven CarGuideiHeart RadioRestaurant HubNZMEAbout NZMENZME careersAdvertise with NZMEDigital self-service advertisingBook your classified adPhoto salesNZME Events© Copyright 2024 NZME Publishing LimitedTOPWhitianga rest home: Influenza outbreak, six dead - NZ Herald MenuSearchHeraldSubscribeSign InWaikato Herald homeLatest newsSportBusinessRuralLifestyleLotto resultsSubscriptionsHerald PremiumViva PremiumThe ListenerBusinessDeskSectionsLatest newsSportBusinessRuralAll RuralDairy farmingSheep & beef farmingHorticultureAnimal healthRural businessRural lifeRural technologyLifestyleLotto resultsLocationsHamiltonCoromandel & HaurakiMatamata & PiakoCambridgeTe AwamutuTokoroa & South WaikatoTaupō & TūrangiWeatherThamesHamiltonTokoroaTaumarunuiTaupōNZME NetworkAdvertise with NZMEOneRoofDriven Car GuideBusinessDeskNewstalk ZBWhat the ActualSunliveGisborne HeraldZMThe HitsCoastRadio HaurakiThe Alternative Commentary CollectiveGoldFlavaiHeart RadioHokonuiRestaurant HubNZME EventsSign InSubscribeAdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Home / Waikato NewsWhitianga rest home: Influenza outbreak, six deadBy Malisha KumarMultimedia journalist·Waikato Herald·13 Feb, 2024 04:42 AM2 mins to readSaveShareShare this articleCopy LinkEmailFacebookTwitter/XLinkedInRedditCommunities reflect one year on from Cyclone Gabrielle, more privacy concerns for supermarket customers, and why fixing the 111 system won’t be happening any time soon in the latest NZ Herald headlines.

the main colony in Wales and once the fourth largest in the world - dropped from 34,491 in 2022, to 16,482 last year.The Welsh government said it was committed to delivering a seabird conservation strategy this year, aiming to protect species from avian flu and other emergencies.Beachgoers urged to take care as bird flu spreadsPublished28 July 2023What is bird flu and what's behind the outbreak?Published18 JuneFor the first time, a new report tries to quantify the impact of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) on UK seabirds.The report said gannets, common terns and Sandwich terns were among 11 species that were increasing in numbers in Wales before the first major outbreak of HPAI in 2021.Julian Hughes, head of species for RSPB Cymru, said: "The latest figures say Grassholm is now back to where it was in 1969."In one year, HPAI has undone what took more than 50 years of growth."Nearly all of the Sandwich terns in Wales nest at Cemlyn on Anglesey and figures from North Wales Wildlife Trust showed there were between 2,200 and 2,400 nests there in 2022.Last year, there were 1,100.Overall, the number of common terns and Sandwich terns in Wales has dropped by more than 40%, according to the RSPB.Black-headed gulls, - which were red-listed before bird flu - have seen a decrease in population in Wales of 77% since the last detailed census in 2015-21.Other species, including kittiwakes and herring gulls, were already declining because of other threats faced by sea birds, such as climate change, and continue to do so, the charity said.Mr Hughes said: "In 2022-23 some of our biggest colonies were devastated by avian flu and we saw many dead adults and chicks."Sea birds live for a long time but produce only one or two chicks per year, so bird flu will have an impact on their population for several, or many, years to come."There are currently no reported cases of HPAI in wild birds in Wales, but migrating sea birds are due to return later this year.The Welsh government said its sea bird conservation strategy, being done in conjunction with the Joint Nature Conservation Committee, Natural Resources Wales, British Trust for Ornithology and RSPB was "making good progress".It added: "It will identify opportunities to enhance our seabird populationsâ resilience to pressures such as avian flu, as well as the climate and nature emergencies."Related topicsWalesSeabirdsTop storiesAssisted dying bill has strict safeguards, says MP proposing law changePublished1 hour agoGary Lineker to leave BBC's Match of the DayPublished6 hours agoWatch: 'Any good?'

READ ALSO:WHO Urges Governments To Develop Vaccines for All Animal Influenza Strain This was contained in a public health advisory issued by the Director of Veterinary Services, Ministry for Agriculture and Rural Development, Dr. Abdulateef Salman Olugbon, on behalf of the Permanent Secretary, Ishiaq Yinka Oloruko-oba. According to the public health advisory, the public, most especially the poultry farmers and bird owners, are advised to implement strict biosecurity measures to prevent the spread of the virus into the state. *Releases Public Health Advisory Guidelines* The advisory also urged the general public to remain vigilant and report any suspected cases or symptoms related to Avian Influenza to the relevant authorities for prompt investigation and further necessary action. The symptoms, according to the advisory, include sudden death, respiratory distress, and reduction in egg production. The public health advisory also enjoined every individual involved in poultry business or having close contact with infected birds, to ensure appropriate use of personal protective equipment (PPE) such as; gloves, face masks and others in order to minimize the risk of transmission to human beings. The public health advisory further seeks for the cooperation of all residents, stakeholders, and relevant authorities to adhere strictly to the recommended guidelines to prevent the spread of the virus into the state, in view of its significant mortalities among poultry populations; and its zoonotic nature to avoid both economic losses and its threats to public health. It further informed the general public to contact Dr. Abdulateef Olugbon, Director, Veterinary Services on 08033765024 or Dr. Idiat Aminu on 08160989312, and report any suspected cases with the aforementioned symptoms.

(Source: istock.com)ADVERTISEMENTIn a statement to 1News, Oceania Healthcare's group general manager of sales and services Anita Hawthorne expressed her "deepest sympathies" to those families who have lost loved ones due to the virus."We worked closely with Te Whatu Ora ensuring full infection control protocols were followed, and can advise that there are no more influenza virus cases at our Whitianga Care Centre," she said."We also want to thank our valued team members who worked closely and sensitively with residents, their families and the community during this isolated outbreak."A 'very significant outbreak'Professor Michael Baker. (Source: 1News)Otago University epidemiology professor Michael Baker said the number of deaths was "certainly unusual" but that cases of the flu and outbreaks of this nature can occur year-round."The big problem is that you have a whole lot of very vulnerable older people living in very confined conditions and that is just a formula, unfortunately, for influenza to spread rapidly," he said.ADVERTISEMENTBaker said it takes only one person to introduce influenza into an aged care facility population to cause a "high mortality rate"."I think there were about 40 to 45 residents [infected] there, so that's a very high mortality risk in that group. It looks like about 30% of staff and residents were affected, so that is a very significant outbreak," he said."Flu kills about 500 people every year in New Zealand. And most of those deaths happen in winter time."Baker said elderly populations that are otherwise "quite well" face a higher mortality risk from contracting respiratory viruses such as influenza and Covid-19."For flu and Covid-19, of course, we have vaccines that are very effective and reducing but not eliminating our chance of getting infected. And also, improving outcomes is still the most important measure."He said the outbreak serves as a reminder for family or staff visiting elderly relatives to take specific precautions to stop the aerosol spread of respiratory viruses."So that means if residents are sick, they're isolated in their own room and obviously visitors and staff should not visit if they are sick because if we can keep the virus out of these facilities, that is going to protect all the residents and that's really important".ADVERTISEMENTNew ZealandHealthTauranga and Bay of PlentySHARE MEMore StoriesVIEW MOREMore StoriesPharmac to disestablish Māori advisory groupPharmac established Te Rōpū in 2022 following a damning independent review of the agency and health outcomes for Māori, Pacific and people with disabilities.Health2:07pmThe Bay of Plenty mum cooking up a storm on social mediaParis Nuku is sharing her heritage and cooking skills with hundreds of thousands of people on TikTok and Instagram.
