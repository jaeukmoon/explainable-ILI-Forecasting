Background Avian influenza (bird flu) refers to a disease caused by infection with avian (bird) influenza (flu) Type A viruses. Bird flu viruses can infect birds' respiratory and gastrointestinal tract and have been identified in more than 100 species of wild birds worldwide. Wild aquatic birds, including gulls, terns, and shorebirds, and wild waterfowl, such as ducks, geese, and swans, are considered reservoirs (natural hosts) for bird flu viruses. Most wild birds infected with bird flu viruses are asymptomatic (i.e., do not exhibit signs or symptoms of illness). Some bird flu viruses can infect domestic poultry and other domestic and backyard birds, and outbreaks of bird flu in domestic poultry occur worldwide. For more information: Avian Influenza – WOAH – World Organisation for Animal Health and the WOAH-WAHIS. Some bird flu viruses have infected other mammalian species, and rare, sporadic human infections with some bird flu viruses have occurred. Keep Reading: Current U.S. Bird Flu Situation in Humans Domestic Summary Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI)A A(H5) viruses have been detected in U.S. wild aquatic birds, commercial poultry and backyard and hobbyist flocks beginning in January 2022. These are the first detections of HPAI A(H5) viruses in the United States since 2016. Preliminary genetic sequencing and RT-PCR testing on some virus specimens shows these viruses are HPAI A(H5N1) viruses from clade 2.3.4.4bB. More information is available from the following spotlight articles. The latest case reports on bird flu outbreaks in wild birds, commercial poultry, and backyard birds in the United States are available from the USDA website. A handout containing information and guidance for people exposed to birds with bird flu is available at What To Know About Bird Flu. Global Summary In the past decade, there have been increases in the reported number and geographic spread of bird flu infections, increases in the number of subtypes of bird flu viruses that have infected birds, and increases in the number of bird species that bird flu viruses have infected. The largest increase in HPAI A(H5N1) virus outbreaks in poultry and wild birds occurred during 2004-2006, During 2013-2021, different HPAI A(H5) and A(H7) virus subtypes as well as low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) A(H3), A(H5), A(H6), A(H7), and A(H9) virus subtypes caused animal outbreaks globally. Since 2020, there has been a global increase in the number of HPAI A(H5) outbreaks reported in wild birds and poultry. There were more outbreaks reported in 2020-2021 than in the previous four years combined. Europe, Africa, and Southeast Asia reported multiple outbreaks of HPAI A(H5N8) starting in 2020 and HPAI A(H5N1) starting in 2021. During this same time, HPAI A(H5N6) virus outbreaks were reported in Asia, particularly China and Vietnam, and Southeast China (Chinese Taipei) reported outbreaks of HPAI A(H5N2) virus in poultry. In 2021, Europe reported multiple outbreaks of HPAI A(H5N5) virus and reported the first outbreaks of HPAI A(H5N4) virus in wild birds. In December 2021, HPAI A(H5N1) viruses were detected in birds in Newfoundland, Canada, marking the first identification of this virus in the Americas since June 2015. Ancestors of these HPAI A(H5N1) viruses first emerged in Asia in the late 1990s and began spreading widely in birds throughout Asia in 2003, and later spread to Africa, Europe, and the Middle East, causing sporadic human infections. Since 2003, multiple different clades of A(H5N1) viruses have circulated over the years, including a clade that was introduced by wild birds into the United States in 2014 and circulated until 2016. 54 countries reported H5N1 bird flu outbreaks in birds in 2021 and 2022. Specifically, from 2013-2021, the following HPAI and LPAI virus subtypes were reported in animals, mostly in wild aquatic waterfowl or domestic poultry: HPAI A(H5) virus subtypes detected included: H5N1, H5N2, H5N3, H5N4, H5N5, H5N6, H5N8, H5N9, and H5NxC HPAI A(H7) virus subtypes detected included: H7N1, H7N2, H7N3, H7N7, H7N8 and H7N9 LPAI A virus subtypes detected included H3N1, H5N1, H5N2, H5N3, H5N5, H5N6, H5N8, H5N8, H5NxC, H6NxC, H7N1, H7N2, H7N3, H7N4, H7N6, H7N7, H7N8, H7N9, and H7NxC A pair of northern pintail ducks. Bird flu viruses occur naturally among wild aquatic birds worldwide. Wild aquatic birds include waterbirds (waterfowl) such as ducks, geese, swans, gulls, and terns, and shorebirds, such as storks and plovers. Classification of Bird Flu Viruses Specific bird flu viruses are classified and differentiated from one another by their genetic properties. Samples of circulating bird flu viruses are collected, and a laboratory process called genetic characterization is used to assess the viruses' genetic properties. The genetic differences among a group of flu viruses are shown by organizing them into a graphic called a phylogenetic tree. Phylogenetic trees for flu viruses are like family (genealogy) trees for people. The trees show how closely related individual viruses are to one another. Each sequence from a specific flu virus has its own branch on the tree. Where branches meet, these "nodes" represent the common ancestor of the viruses and indicate that the viruses share similar genetic sequences. Viruses that share a common ancestor can also be described as belonging to the same clade. Many of the recently reported H5N1 bird flu viruses causing infections in wild birds and poultry in the United States belong to clade 2.3.4.4b. More information about clades and genetic characterization of influenza viruses is available at Influenza Virus Genome Sequencing and Genetic Characterization. Highly Pathogenic and Low Pathogenic Avian Flu A Viruses Avian influenza A viruses are classified into the following two categories: low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) A viruses, and highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A viruses. The categories refer to molecular characteristics of a virus and the virus' ability to cause disease and mortality in chickens in a laboratory setting. HPAI and LPAI are defined and explained below: Low Pathogenic Avian Influenza (LPAI): Low pathogenic avian influenza viruses cause either no signs of disease or mild disease in chickens/poultry (such as ruffled feathers and a drop in egg production). Most avian influenza A viruses are low pathogenic and cause few signs of disease in infected wild birds. In poultry, some low-pathogenic viruses can mutate into highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses. Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI): Highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses cause severe disease and high mortality in infected poultry. Only some avian influenza A(H5) and A(H7) viruses are classified as HPAI A viruses, while most A(H5) and A(H7) viruses circulating among birds are LPAI A viruses. HPAI A(H5) or A(H7) virus infections can cause disease that affects multiple internal organs with mortality up to 90% to 100% in chickens, often within 48 hours. However, ducks can be infected without any signs of illness. HPAI A(H5) and A(H7) virus infections in poultry also can spill back into wild birds, resulting in further geographic spread of the virus as those birds migrate. While some wild bird species can be infected with some HPAI A(H5) or A(H7) virus subtypes without appearing sick, other HPAI A(H5) and A(H7) virus subtypes can cause severe disease and mortality in some infected wild birds as well as in infected poultry. Both HPAI and LPAI viruses can spread rapidly through poultry flocks. HPAI and LPAI designations do not refer to or correlate with the severity of illness in cases of human infection with these viruses; both LPAI and HPAI A viruses have caused mild to severe illness in infected humans. There are genetic and antigenic differences between the influenza A virus subtypes that typically infect only birds and those that can infect birds and people. Responsibilities of Federal Agencies for Avian Influenza The U.S. Department of Interior (DOI) and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) are the lead federal agencies for outbreak investigation and control in wild birds, and the USDA is the lead agency for such activities in domestic birds. CDC coordinates with DOI, USDA, and with state health departments on appropriate public health measures and works with animal health colleagues to minimize the public health risk posed by avian influenza A viruses.

While the role of absolute humidity and temperature is extensively studied, the possibility of ambient ozone (O3) as an environmental driver of influenza has received scant attention. Here, using state-level data in the USA during 2010–2015, we examined such research hypothesis. For rigorous causal inference by evidence triangulation, we applied 3 distinct methods for data analysis: Convergent Cross Mapping from state-space reconstruction theory, Peter-Clark-momentary-conditional-independence plus as graphical modeling algorithms, and regression-based Generalised Linear Model. The negative impact of ambient O3 on influenza activity at 1-week lag is consistently demonstrated by those 3 methods. With O3 commonly known as air pollutant, the novel findings here on the inhibition effect of O3 on influenza activity warrant further investigations to inform environmental management and public health protection.

To ease the threat of seasonal and novel influenza epidemics, improved understanding of potential environmental drivers of influenza dynamics has been a research priority. Influenza activity is affected by multi-dimensional determinants, including antigenic drift, host susceptibility3, social factors (e.g., population-mixing and contact rates)4, and environmental conditions5. Previous epidemiological and experimental studies have examined the relationships of absolute humidity (AH) and temperature (T) with influenza6,7. Recently, a negative association between daily ambient ozone (O3) and influenza transmissibility has also been reported in a time series study of Hong Kong8. This human population finding of Hong Kong is consistent with some available laboratory and clinical evidence that the commonly known air pollutant and pulmonary irritant, O3, not only exhibits virucidal potential through its oxidizing power9,10, but also primes host immunity against viral infection11,12,13. It would be intriguing to see whether the O3-influenza relationship observed in subtropical Hong Kong also holds true in temperate climates. In this work, we used the publicly available weekly state-level data in the USA during 2010–2015 to examine the acute effect of ambient O3 on influenza dynamics—whether a change in weekly ambient O3 leads to a change in influenza activity within 2 weeks in the community when keeping all other variables the same.The totality of evidence has been proposed as a way forward to strengthen causal inference with observational data14: cross-checking multiple methods can enable more robust causal interpretation that is supported by multiple algorithms and conceptual principles but contradicted by none. Here, we propose an integrative methodological framework with three distinct approaches in examining the effect of ambient O3 on influenza dynamics in the USA. Namely, (1) Convergent cross mapping (CCM), a causality test kit based on state-space reconstruction (SSR) for dynamical systems15,16, (2) a graphical modeling approach called Peter-Clark-momentary-conditional-independence plus (PCMCI+)17,18, and (3) a statistical regression method Generalized Linear Model (GLM)19, are used in our study. Since these methods are endowed with disparate theoretical assumptions and hidden biases, we envision that the confidence to make causal inference regarding the scientific question of interest would be strengthened if consistent findings are reached14,20.ResultsDynamic data of environmental variables and influenzaWeekly time series of environmental variables (namely, O3, AH, and T) and influenza activity (“Flu”) in the USA during October 3, 2010 to May 31, 2015 are depicted in Fig. 1. “Flu” is calculated by taking the product of two proportions: the proportion of influenza-like-illness (ILI) cases among all clinical visits in the community and the proportion of influenza-positive specimens, being an arguably good proxy measure of influenza activity in the community (see details in the “Method” section). Seasonality is observed in all the time series, with influenza activity showing winter peak but summer trough, and environmental variables showing the opposite to certain extent. There are long stretches of 0 values in the influenza time series, especially outside of influenza season, which contain little causal information for exploration. As a consequence, this study only focused on the influenza season (that is considered October through May) in the USA for analysis. The weekly mean level of influenza activity is \(4.25\times {10}^{-3}\), which can be understood as 425 expected cases per 100,000 population.Fig. 1: Weekly time series of environmental measurements and influenza activity in 46 states of the USA during 2010–2015.Influenza activity is indicated by the variable “Flu” which is the product of two proportions: the proportion of influenza-like-illness cases among all clinical consultations in the community and the proportion of laboratory confirmed influenza-positive specimens among all specimens tested. Long stretches of 0 values for “Flu” in non-influenza season (June to September), shaded in gray columns, contain little information for causal inference and thus are omitted from data analysis.Full size imageEnvironmental drivers of influenzaThe estimated effects of environmental factors on influenza activity in the USA using three methods (namely, CCM, PCMCI+, and GLM) are summarised in Table 1. While these methods adopt different measures of effect size, they share one common interpretation rule: a negative value indicates a negative effect size, and vice versa. The negative effect of 1-week lagged AH on influenza activity was detected by PCMCI+ and GLM but not CCM, and the negative effect of 2-week lagged air T on influenza was detected by GLM alone. Ambient O3 was found to reduce influenza activity (\(p < 1.0\times {10}^{-3}\)) at lag 1 (week), consistently by three distinct methods.Table 1 Effects of environmental factors on influenza activity estimated by three distinct methods, based on weekly state-level data of the USA during 2010–2015Full size tableCCM under the umbrella of Empirical Dynamic Modeling (EDM) approach was used to conduct the causality test in dynamical systems15. The intuition behind CCM is to examine how well a hypothesized driving variable can be cross-mapped (cross-predicted) by the effect variable given putative causal information injected. And such cross-mapping should perform better as more data points (i.e., larger library size) are available to construct the attractor, showing a convergence property, thus the name Convergent Cross-Mapping (CCM) for causality test (see details in the “Methods” section). Here, the CCM skill was calculated as the improved prediction accuracy obtained at the maximum library size over that at the minimum library size (\(\varDelta {\rho }_{{{{{{{\rm{CCM}}}}}}}}={\rho }_{{{{{{\rm{maxLib}}}}}}}-{\rho }_{{{{{{\rm{minLib}}}}}}}\)). To rule out the influence of shared seasonality between time series, the CCM skill (\(\varDelta {\rho }_{{{{{{{\rm{CCM}}}}}}}}\)) of observed time series was tested against surrogate data. Figure 2a presents the state-level CCM surrogate tests on whether there is a causal effect of O3, AH and T at 1-week lag on influenza activity; Fig. 2b presents a summary of measured \(\varDelta {\rho }_{{{{{{{\rm{CCM}}}}}}}}\) of each state and the nationwide meta-significance estimates by summing the logs of state-specific CCM test p values. While the state-level relationships are variable and all three environmental factors could drive influenza activity in some states (as signified by filled red dots), the nationwide test indicates that O3 alone is an environmental driver of influenza activity at the significance threshold of \({p}_{{{{{{{\rm{meta}}}}}}}} < 1.0\times {10}^{-3}\); moreover, CCM skill for O3 is significantly greater than that for AH (\(p < 2.8\times {10}^{-5}\)) and T (\(p < 4.3\times {10}^{-5}\)) by Wilcoxon rank sum test. When repeating CCM in the nonsensical causal direction by setting the candidate cause and effect in reverse, none of the CCM results is significant (see Supplementary Fig. S1), addressing the concern of spurious relationship generated by noncausal synchrony.Fig. 2: Causality tests by convergent cross-mapping (CCM) for the effect of environmental factors (ozone [O3], absolute humidity [AH], temperature [T]) at 1-week lag on influenza activity in the states of USA.a State-specific observed CCM skills (as circles), \({\Delta \rho }_{{{{{{{\rm{CCM}}}}}}}}\), and their null distribution in 1000 seasonal surrogates (as line ranges). Circles are filled to signify the measured \({\Delta \rho }_{{{{{{{\rm{CCM}}}}}}}}\) for each state exceeding 95% of its null values. b Summary of state-specific \({\Delta \rho }_{{{{{{{\rm{CCM}}}}}}}}\) values in violin plots. Meta-significance estimate for the nation (\({p}_{{{{{{{\rm{meta}}}}}}}}\)) is tested by summing the logs of state-level p values; CCM causality is deemed significant with \({p}_{{{{{{{\rm{meta}}}}}}}} < {1.0\times 10}^{-3}\).Full size imageFollowing CCM causality test, multivariate S-map (sequential locally weighted global linear map) is conducted to quantify the effect magnitude of putative environmental drivers on influenza activity16,21. Figure 3 plots the state-specific median effect size of O3, at 1-week lag, on influenza activity onto the map, showing a mostly negative sign across the states. The median effect size is −0.106; that is, one SD increment in O3 (8.3 ppb) leads to a 0.106 SD decrease in logit-transformed influenza activity in the following week. All states see negative effect size except for the two states of Mississippi and Hawaii though they do not pass the CCM causality tests (Fig. 2a). The effect estimates of AH and T on influenza are also negative, but they fail to pass the CCM causality tests (Table 1).Fig. 3: State-specific effect strength estimates for ozone (O3) affecting influenza activity at 1-week lag.Multivariate S-map technique is used to estimate the effect size, along with CCM test on causality. With normalization of data, the effect magnitude is in a standardized metric. A diverging palette centered at 0 is used to distinguish between positive (red) and negative values (blue). The darker the color, the stronger the effect size in either direction. Four states (FL, NJ, RI, and VT) shaded in gray are excluded from analysis due to influenza data missingness. Map was plotted using “usmap” R package (version 0.6.1)60.Full size imageTo cement the credibility of making causal inference, a probabilistic graphical modeling framework called PCMCI+ (see detailed description in “Methods” section) is adopted to estimate the causal networks of the underlying system17,18. The output of PCMCI+ reads as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) which can be interpreted as random variables (in nodes) linked by causal dependencies under certain assumptions (Supplementary Table S1). Figure 4a shows the state-by-state dependency networks. Eighteen out of 46 states see a direct link from O3 to influenza activity, of which 17 are of a negative sign and 1 is positive for North Dakota. Thirteen states see direct and/or indirect links from AH to influenza activity: the effect sign is mixed but largely negative. Fifteen states see negative link from T to influenza activity, of which 10 links are direct, but 5 are indirect through O3. Here, the hyperparameter significance level (\({\alpha }_{{{{{{{\rm{PC}}}}}}}}\)) for iteratively filtering out spurious links was set as 0.05 at the state-level analyses.Fig. 4: Graphical modeling by PCMCI+ based on dynamic data of environmental factors (ozone [O3], absolute humidity [AH], temperature [T]) and influenza activity (Flu) in the states of USA.a State-specific causal graph estimates. Curved and straight edges represent the lagged and contemporaneous causal dependencies, respectively; the number on the curve indicates a lagged relationship in weeks. Node color denotes autocorrelation strength (i.e., auto-MCI [Momentary Conditional Independence] value); edge color depicts the causal strength (i.e., cross-MCI) estimated via partial correlation. b Nationwide causal graph estimate. The hyperparameter significance level (αPC) is set as 0.05 for individual states and 0.001 for the nationwide analysis.Full size imageFigure 4b shows a summary dependency graph estimated by concatenated time series from individual states; a more stringent criterion \({\alpha }_{{{{{{{\rm{PC}}}}}}}}\) of \(1.0\times {10}^{-3}\) was used to yield the nationwide graphical output. Ambient O3 bears a direct negative effect on influenza activity at lag 0 (i.e., within the same week) and a lag of 1 week; air T affects influenza activity in a negative manner indirectly through O3 at lag 0. With respect to AH, its total effect on influenza activity is obscure: aside from a direct negative coupling at lag 1, it also has indirect but positive effect through O3. AH and T are strongly coupled with each other, as expected.Supplementary to the above two causal discovery methods, customary regression method of GLM is conducted at each state to analyze the relationship of environmental factors with influenza activity, adjusting for secular trend, seasonality, as well as inherent autocorrelation. Figure 5a indicates that 1-week lagged statistical associations between each environmental variable and influenza activity are mixed at state level. The state-level regression coefficients are then pooled using a meta-analysis model (Fig. 5b). One SD increment in O3 concentration is associated with a reduction of 0.102 (CI: −0.186, −0.018; \(p < 5.9\times {10}^{-5}\)) in logit-transformed influenza activity 1 week after (Table 1). Meanwhile, AH and T are also negatively associated with influenza activity at lag 1 and lag 2, respectively (Table 1).Fig. 5: Effects of environmental factors on influenza activity, at 1-week lag, estimated by generalized linear model (GLM).a State-level point estimates of regression coefficients (β) and their 95% confidence intervals shown as circles and line ranges, respectively (n = 173 weeks of dynamic data); Circles are filled when the p value for statistical significance test is <0.05 (two-sided). b Nationwide point risk estimates with the corresponding 99.9% confidence intervals shown as circles and line ranges, respectively, after pooling state-level coefficients (n = 46). Circles are filled when the p value is <0.001 (two-sided) during meta-analysis.

Three sets of results consistently demonstrate the negative impact of ambient O3 on influenza activity in the community.Hitherto, a limited number of population-level studies have examined the relationship between ambient O3 and influenza, and the findings have been mixed. The integrated assessment of O3 by the USEPA22 cited two references that reported positive associations of O3 and influenza in Hong Kong and Brisbane23,24, respectively. The report in Hong Kong, however, was not actually on the relation of O3 and influenza specifically; rather, that report aggregated influenza and pneumonia into one group, which was associated with environmental O3. The other report on the positive association of O3 with pediatric influenza in Brisbane did not strenuously control for potential temporal confounding in the time-series analysis. A more recent time series analysis using Hong Kong surveillance data during 1998–2013 demonstrated that ambient O3 is negatively associated with reduced influenza transmissibility (i.e., real-time effective reproduction number, Rt)8. The current study based on the data in the USA, demonstrates again an inhibiting effect of O3 on community-level influenza activity.One explanation of the O3 inhibition effect on influenza could relate to its direct virucidal potential. O3 inactivation of influenza virus has been reported in studies in vitro. Influenza virus (WSN strain) suspended on a thin film was inactivated within a few hours by an O3 concentration of 160 ppb (342 µg/m3)25. In mice studies, however, O3 exposure at 500 ppb appeared to have no effect on pulmonary virus titers; rather, O3 diminishes the severity of influenza virus infection and lung injury evidenced by less widespread infection in the lung parenchyma26,27. In the current study, the average level of daily maximum 8-h O3 is less than 40 ppb in the USA. At this low ambient level of O3, O3-primed host immunity against influenza infection constitutes a more plausible explanation of the population findings presented here.Inhaled ambient O3 primes the pulmonary immune system boosting allergic responses in healthy and susceptible populations28,29. Following O3 exposure, a myriad of immune responses is triggered, and multiple interleukins (IL) are released from epithelial cells, macrophages, and other myeloid cells30. Among them, IL-33, acting as an endogenous “alarmin” in response to airway barrier damage incurred by O331,32, is endowed with pleiotropic and homeostatic functions orchestrating airway injury and repair12,30. Likewise, IL-33 is also highly expressed following invasion of influenza virus, playing a pivotal role of dynamic immune modulator during the course of infection33,34. It is plausible that O3-induced IL-33 in the cytokine milieu is involved in an immune crosstalk assisting human defense against influenza.In the setting of inflammation combating foreign antigen, over-expressed IL-33, signaled via its receptor ST2, can be redirected from the default type 2‑inducing capacity to augment type 1 immunity, amplifying antiviral CD8+ T cell and natural killer cell responses13,35,36. In mice models of influenza infection, exogenous IL-33 inoculation could enhance recruitment of dendritic cells (DCs), increase secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-12, and prime cytotoxic T-Cell responses, facilitating viral clearance37. IL-33 may protect against influenza by orchestrating Th1/Th2 paradigm and so maintaining a fine balance of pro-inflammatory pathogen clearance and anti-inflammatory tissue repair38,39. During the resolution phase of infection event, IL-33 acts on residential ST2-expressing group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) as well as regulatory T (Treg) cells to restore airway tissue homeostasis, mediated at least partly by amphiregulin (AREG)-dependent repair of virus-damaged epithelium40,41.The hypothesis of O3-elicited IL-33 conferring cross-protection against influenza gains strength further from the evidence of its promising role as a mucosal vaccine adjuvant42. Exogenous IL-33 co-administered intranasally with recombinant influenza A hemagglutinin (rHA) induced significantly higher antigen (Ag)-specific plasma immunoglobulin G (IgG) and mucosal IgA antibody (Ab) levels as well as enhanced production of both Th1 and Th2-related cytokines, all of which resulted in better protective capacity of the vaccine43. Besides, endogenous IL-33 release, within 24 h, after administration of alum-adjuvanted nasal influenza vaccine, induced higher IgA Ab production via enhancing Ag presentation on DCs and promoting ILC2 activation44. These findings allude to possible parallels between adjuvanticity of nasally administered alum and ambient O3 exposure.This study strives to triangulate the evidence by integrating results from different research approaches with distinct theories and working hypotheses. Under the combo methodological framework, CCM employs the idea of SSR for attractors of deterministic dynamical systems thereby addressing better nonlinear state-dependent couplings, but it is less well suited for time series of purely stochastic nature that is better handled with PCMCI+ method45. By contrast, PCMCI+ builds on assessing (conditional) probability distribution of random variables, and thus lacks power to recover the non-separable couplings in deterministic systems46. On the other hand, the difficulty of PCMCI+ in handling latent (hidden) variables can be addressed in the state-space based method of CCM47. The qualitative dependency structure revealed by PCMCI+ can then be complemented by quantitative risk estimates in the time series regression method of GLM by properly controlling for confounding factors.A few limitations and caveats of the current study require due consideration. The first concern derives from its reliance on passive surveillance data, which can be subject to measurement error. For example, surveillance practices to identify laboratory-confirmed influenza cases as well as healthcare-seeking behaviors due to influenza-like-illness (ILI) can vary across states and years, which may hamper our ability to accurately estimate the actual influenza activity. However, by utilizing a comprehensive proxy measure that combines the laboratory and clinical data, such issue has been minimized to our best effort48. Secondly, with the scarcity of virologically confirmed subtype data, we aggregated influenza cases across all influenza subtypes to reduce the number of missing values. Since lineage-specific differences might exist in the effects of O3 and other climatic factors, future studies are warranted to integrate the subtyping and antigenic information into analysis. Thirdly, note that our findings are generated from publicly available state-level weekly data over a time span of 5 years. It remains an important topic for future studies to decode the nuanced relationships of environmental variables with influenza activity on finer spatial and temporal scale, since factors such as demographic features, social connectivity, tourism activities (e.g., Hawaii), as well as public health interventions can lead to fundamentally different base transmission potential, which may interact with environmental factors to shape the complex influenza dynamics4,49.In closing, this study reveals a negative impact of ambient O3 on community-level influenza activity by triangulating evidence derived from distinct data analysis approaches. Our finding warrants more laboratory or molecular studies to corroborate the mechanisms shaping the observed causal link in the population, so as to better inform environmental management for public health protection. Moreover, we hope that this work, through a novel integration of divergent analytical frameworks, will catalyze further coordinated efforts in causal discovery using observational dynamic data.MethodsInfluenza dataWe retrieved state-level weekly laboratory confirmed influenza data from the USA Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website during the period from October 3, 2010 to September 27, 2015. The counts of laboratory positive cases for influenza (by type A and type B) were reported weekly by designated laboratories located in each state through the platform of World Health Organization (WHO)/National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) Collaborating Labs. We also retrieved the weekly reported data on medically attended visits for ILI from CDC for each state during our study period. Over 3000 outpatient healthcare providers throughout the country reported the number of patients with ILI and number of total patient consultations via the U.S. Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet) each week.Due to limited testing capacity in each state, laboratory surveillance data are unable to fully represent influenza activity in the population. Fortunately, ILI data from sentinel outpatient clinics possibly cover a wider spectrum of community influenza cases, despite lower diagnostic specificity. In our study, we incorporated the information from these two available sources to quantify the community-level influenza activities. We computed the representative proxy of influenza activity (denoted as “Flu”) in community by multiplying the weekly proportion of ILI outpatient consultations with the weekly proportion of specimens tested positive for influenza. That is, \({{{{{{\rm{Flu}}}}}}}_{{{{{{{\rm{proxy}}}}}}}}=({{{{{{\rm{Flu}}}}}}}_{{{{{{{\rm{positive}}}}}}}}/{{{{{{\rm{Flu}}}}}}}_{{{{{{{\rm{total}}}}}}}})*({{{{{{\rm{ILI}}}}}}}_{{{{{{{\rm{outpatient}}}}}}}}/{{{{{{\rm{Outpatient}}}}}}}_{{{{{{{\rm{total}}}}}}}})\). This proxy measure, developed and used by epidemiologists to minimize under-reporting bias in the laboratory-confirmed influenza data as well as to address unobservability of infection in the ILI data, has been validated as a better linear correlate of influenza virus infections in the community population50,51,52.Environmental variables dataTo explore the proposed environmental drivers of influenza activity, we obtained ambient O3 concentration data in the USA for each state from the Tropospheric Ozone Assessment Report (TOAR) of the International Global Atmospheric Chemistry (IGAC)53. Specifically, station-based daily maximum 8-h average O3 levels (ppb) were extracted and averaged by state for analysis. State-level weather data were collected from the National Center for Environmental Information (NCEI), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). During the extraction of environmental variables, a centering approach was used to reduce the station-related measurement bias54. That is, raw environmental measurements were centered with respect to their long-term station-specific average and then added with the state-wide average. The daily averages of air temperature (°F) and dew point temperature (°F), computed from hourly land-based station observations, were extracted and converted to Celsius values. Daily absolute humidity, a measure of water vapor density in the air (\({{{{{\rm{g}}}}}}/{{{{{{\rm{m}}}}}}}^{3}\)), was calculated from the dew point and air temperature, following standard meteorological formulas55. The daily O3 and weather time series were further aggregated into week to match the resolution of influenza data.Statistical analysesThere are many long stretches of 0 values in the influenza time series, especially outside of flu season, which contain little or very limited causal information about the environmental factors. Consequently, this study only focused on the flu season (that is considered October through May) in the USA for analysis56. States which have at least 3 consecutive years of available influenza data are included. Out of the 50 states, 46 were finally eligible for study; states of Vermont, Rhode Island, New Jersey, and Florida were excluded.The analytical framework in this study consists of three distinct but complementary methods: CCM, PCMCI+, and GLM, to strive for detection of causal links notably by evidence accumulation (Please refer to a tabulated summary of these three methods in Supplementary Table S1). Firstly, the SSR-based CCM method was applied to examine the existence and strength of causal imprint (as defined in dynamical systems) of candidate drivers on influenza activity, followed by quantification of the effect size using S-map. Secondly, graphical modeling method PCMCI+ was conducted to depict the causal dependency structure (detailed assumptions are explained below and in Table S1) between environmental variables and influenza activity by a DAG57. Finally, traditional time series regression GLM was applied to estimate the statistical association of each environmental variable with influenza activity while controlling for the other two simultaneously. To explore the temporal structure of dependency, we tested multiple time lags from 0 to 2 with weekly data. Our analyses were conducted in the R (version 4.1.1) and Python (version 3.8). The “rEDM” package (version 1.9.2)58, a collection of methods for EDM, was utilized to generate the CCM and S-map results. The “Tigramite” package (version 4.2) was harnessed to complete the PCMCI+ dependency network modeling17. The “mgcv” (version 1.8-37)59 was adopted to fit the quasi-Binomial regression model. Nationwide map for visualizing state-specific S-map effect estimates was produced using “usmap” R package (version 0.6.1)60.CCMGiven dynamic data, CCM which harnesses the technique of SSR for dynamical systems47 was introduced to evaluate the potential driving role of ambient O3, AH and T on the influenza activity. In the dynamical system theory, as the system state evolves over time, its motion can trace out a trajectory, which collectively form a geometric object often called “attractor manifold”, in the multi-dimensional coordinate space whose axes are the set of causally relevant variables such as humidity, O3 concentrations, infection rates, and so forth. Therefore, time series data of observed variables can be simply comprehended as projection of the whole system dynamics onto certain axis. This underpins the SSR technique following the basic tenet of Takens’ Theorem61; that is, the original multivariate manifold (\(M\)) can be reconstructed using just one of the system variables (e.g., \({X}_{t}\)), by taking its delayed coordinates (i.e., embedding) with a time lag \(\tau\): \( < {X}_{\left(t\right)},{X}_{\left(t-\tau \right)},{X}_{\left(t-2\tau \right)},\ldots,{X}_{\left(t-\left(E-1\right)\tau \right)} > \), where \(E\) is the embedding dimension that can sufficiently “unfold” the dynamics of system manifold so that reconstructed states on shadow manifold \({M}_{X}\) map 1:1 to the original states on \(M\)15.As one of the corollaries to Takens’ Theorem, CCM is the causality test kit (from the aspect of dynamical systems) in the EDM framework proposed by Sugihara’s research group in 201215. This method assumes low-dimensional deterministic system with limited stochasticity45. The basic idea is that if variable \(X\) has a causal influence on variable \(Y\), then the driven time series \({Y}_{t}\) with enough delayed embedding (i.e., reconstructed manifold \({M}_{Y}\)) should contain the necessary dynamics information to recover or cross-predict the current values of \({X}_{t}\), but not vice versa. This practice of using the response variable \(Y\) to forecast the causative variable \(X\) seems counterintuitive, but it has been well illustrated with algebraic equations by Sugihara’s group15. The underpinning algorithms of CCM are built on simplex projection62. Given the shadow manifold \({M}_{Y}\), the \(E+1\) nearest neighbors of \({y}_{t}\) which correspond to similar system states sharing evolving patterns are first selected. Next, the time indices of these neighboring points of \({y}_{t}\) are adopted to locate the corresponding points in \({M}_{X}\) (a putative neighborhood of the predictee). Then, a locally weighted average of the \(E+1\) values of \(X\) is calculated to predict the cross-mapped estimate of \({\hat{x}}_{t}\). Here, the weights are assigned based on the Euclidian distance from \({y}_{t}\) to its each nearest neighbor on \({M}_{Y}\). The value of \(E\) was chosen over the range of 2 to 6 where the maximum of univariate predictability is achieved via leave-one-out cross-validation (Table S2). The lower limit of E = 2 was specified in order to embed at least one external variable to reconstruct multivariate manifold; the upper limit of E = 6 was specified because the maximum E should not be larger than the square root of the consecutive time series data length63, which was 35 or 34 weekly data points in influenza season in the current study.After the cross-mapping is done, we can evaluate the accuracy (i.e., predictability) by the correlation coefficient (\(\rho\)) between the predicted and observed values of \(X\) series. As the number of data points used for prediction (that is, library size, \(L\)) becomes larger, the reconstructed shadow manifold \({M}_{Y}\) will become denser, and the closer nearest neighbors will accordingly lead to lower estimation error (i.e., higher \(\rho\)). Such behavior is referred to as “convergence” and is generally utilized to distinguish true causality (as defined in dynamical systems) from simple correlations15. Here, we compared the cross-mapping skill (\(\rho\)) obtained by the maximum library (i.e., the whole data length) to that obtained by the minimum library (i.e., \(E+2\) data points allowing for simplex projection), and quantified the convergence property of cross-mapping as \(\varDelta {\rho }_{{{{{{{\rm{CCM}}}}}}}}={\rho }_{{{{{{\rm{maxLib}}}}}}}-{\rho }_{{{{{{\rm{minLib}}}}}}}\). In the vein of Deyle et al., shared seasonality of environmental exposures with influenza activity is another ponderable issue in this context7. To preclude spurious CCM results as an artifact of mutual seasonal forcing, we generated an ensemble of 1000 surrogates with randomized seasonal anomalies for the putative cause time series7. Consequently, a null distribution of CCM skill (\(\varDelta {\rho }_{{{{{{{\rm{CCM}}}}}}}}\)) using surrogate time series was formed. As a test of statistical significance, the cross-mapping skill obtained for the original time series should exceed the \({95}{{{{{{{\rm{th}}}}}}}}\) percentile of the null distribution built by seasonal surrogates (i.e., at the \(\alpha < 0.05\) level). Then, the classical Fisher’s methods (that is summation of logs of individual \(p\) values) was applied for meta-significance test for all the states64. To combat the anti-conservativeness of meta-significance \(p\) value estimate, we used a stringent significance threshold of \(\alpha\) as \(1.0\times {10}^{-3}\). We also repeated CCM analysis setting the candidate cause and effect in the nonsensical reverse direction (i.e., to test whether influenza drives environmental factor) to address the concern of potential synchrony yielding spurious covariation65.After qualitative causal relationship was tested, multivariate S-map technique, a method also packed in EDM, was used to examine how and to what degree the putative environmental driver (e.g., O3) influences the influenza activity, thereby quantifying the effect size21. Unlike simplex projection using just nearest neighbors, S-map procedure uses all available data points (thus “global”) in the library to fit local linear regressions at each successive point along the manifold attractor. Through including a nonlinear localization parameter \(\theta\), S-map controls the weighting assigned to each point, thereby tuning how strongly the regression is localized to the target states66. The \(\theta\) was chosen over the range [0.01, 9] that maximizes the univariate S-map forecast performance using leave-one-out cross-validation (Table S2). By taking multivariate embeddings (i.e., using putative causal variable in addition to time-lagged vectors of the effect variable itself) for SSR16,67, the S-map coefficients could approximate the relevant Jacobian matrix elements (that is, partial derivatives \(\partial {{{{{{\rm{Flu}}}}}}}/\partial {{{{{{\rm{Env}}}}}}}\)) in the dynamical multivariate state space, which ably indicates the dynamically state-dependent effect strength of environmental factors (“Env”) on influenza activity (“Flu”)16,21. To ensure an equal weighting for variables of different scales in the multivariate SSR model, time series are normalized to unit mean and variance before analysis, so the magnitude of EDM effects is in a standardized metric.PCMCI+PCMCI+, a novel conditional independence-based method proposed by Jakob Runge in 202017, was employed as a complementary tool to recognize the dependency structure between O3, AH, T and influenza activity under the graphical modeling framework. Leveraging on the classical PC algorithms (named after the developers Peter and Clark)68,69 reoriented to observational time series70, PCMCI+ consists of two main phases, namely skeleton learning phase and subsequent orientation phase. Beyond that, PCMCI+ optimized the selection of conditioning set in conditional independence tests and well exploited autocorrelation, which was demonstrated to yield much higher detection power and orientation recall with better-controlled false positives. Below is a more detailed introduction of PCMCI+ in plain terms. For a good review and comprehensive understanding of this method including algorithms behind, please see Runge et al. papers17,18.Skeleton phaseInitialized with a complete undirected graph (\({{{{{\mathcal{G}}}}}}\)) where all nodes (variables) are inter-connected, the goal of skeleton phase is to eliminate the spurious links caused by indirect paths and common drivers via iterative conditional independence tests at some significance threshold \({\alpha }_{{{{{{{\rm{PC}}}}}}}}\). Here, for the sake of interpretability and analytical tractability, we implemented conditional independence test with Partial Correlation method (i.e., “ParCorr” in the kit) which assumes linear dependencies but also suffices when the non-linear links can be linearly approximated46. As a tuning hyperparameter in the condition-selection step, the significance threshold \({\alpha }_{{{{{{{\rm{PC}}}}}}}}\) was set as 0.05 for state-by-state analysis, while significance was calibrated at a stringent \(1.0\times {10}^{-3}\) level when analyzing the nationwide graphical structure by concatenating all the state-level time series.In practice, the skeleton edge removal phase is conducted for lagged and contemporaneous conditioning sets separately. To illustrate, given \({X}_{t}^{j}\) representing each variableode in the system or target graph (\({{{{{\mathcal{G}}}}}}\)), we firstly test its putative driver/parent (denoted as \({{{{{\mathcal{P}}}}}}({X}_{t}^{j})\)) over all the time-lagged variables \({X}_{t-\tau }^{i}\), where \(i,j\in \{1,\ldots,N\}\) and \(\tau \in \{1,\ldots,{\tau }_{\max }\}\) (here, \({\tau }_{\max }\) was set as 2 based on domain knowledge). In graphical terms, a causal link \({X}_{t-\tau }^{i}\to {X}_{t}^{j}\) will stand if and only if \({X}_{t-\tau }^{i}\) and \({X}_{t}^{j}\) are dependent given any set of conditions. Starting with the first iteration (\(r=0\)), unconditional (i.e., bi-variate) independence tests are performed for all the pairs \(({X}_{t-\tau }^{i},{X}_{t}^{j})\) and \({X}_{t-\tau }^{i}\) is removed from the hypothetical \(\hat{{{{{{\mathcal{P}}}}}}}({X}_{t}^{j})\) set if the \(p\) value cannot pass the significance level \({\alpha }_{{{{{{{\rm{PC}}}}}}}}\). In each next iteration (\(r \to r +1\)), we first sort the \(\hat{{{{{{\mathcal{P}}}}}}}({X}_{t}^{j})\) obtained from last iteration by the absolute value of test statistic, and then select the strongest \(r+1\) parents as the conditions to conduct conditional independence tests for pairs \(({X}_{t-\tau }^{i},{X}_{t}^{j})\). After another round of screening, the hypothetical \(\hat{{{{{{\mathcal{P}}}}}}}({X}_{t}^{j})\) set for each \({X}_{t}^{j}\) is further narrowed down and the algorithm will finally converge with no more conditions available for test. In this way, we could identify the lagged potential parents of each variable.Secondly, to identify contemporaneous potential parents of each \({X}_{t}^{j}\), this stage initializes the graph (\({{{{{\mathcal{G}}}}}}\)) with all contemporaneous variables presumptively linked, together with all lagged dependencies screened from the previous stage. For all the pairs \(({X}_{t-\tau }^{i},{X}_{t}^{j})\) (here, \(\tau \in \{0,\ldots,{\tau }_{\max }\}\) to also examine contemporaneous causal links), momentary conditional independence (MCI) tests are conducted, iterating through all combinations of subset of the contemporaneous conditions (denoted as \({{{{{\mathcal{S}}}}}}\)). Besides, the sets \(\hat{{{{{{\mathcal{P}}}}}}}({X}_{t}^{j})\) and \(\hat{{{{{{\mathcal{P}}}}}}}({X}_{t-\tau }^{i})\) estimated in the previous step are additionally conditioned on, aiming to account for the common drivers, indirect links, and autocorrelation (i.e., paths blocked) with higher detection power and recall. With similar parents-filtering process at each iteration as the previous step, a skeleton of \({{{{{\mathcal{G}}}}}}\) with both contemporaneous and lagged links is finally obtained.Orientation phaseAfter discovery of the skeleton structure, it is necessary to orient the edges on \({{{{{\mathcal{G}}}}}}\) to infer directionality of relationship. Assumptions of causal stationarity (that is, \({X}_{t-\tau }^{i}\to {X}_{t}^{j}\) holds for any \(t\)) and time-order (i.e., cause always precedes effect) are applied to help constrain certain cases and simplify the orientation task. For a lagged dependency or adjacency, time order reveals the directionality without ambiguity. While for contemporaneous links, the orientation process can be divided into two steps including a collider orientation stage followed by additional PC constraint rules.Based on the collider rule, for unshielded triple structures \({X}_{t-\tau }^{i}\to {X}_{t}^{k}-{X}_{t}^{j}(\tau > 0)\) and \({X}_{t-\tau }^{i}-{X}_{t}^{k}-{X}_{t}^{j}(\tau=0),\) we firstly conduct MCI test for pair \(({X}_{t-\tau }^{i},{X}_{t}^{j})\) conditioning on all possible \({{{{{\mathcal{S}}}}}}\), together with their recognized lagged parents (see details above). Second, we store the \({{{{{\mathcal{S}}}}}}\) when \({X}_{t-\tau }^{i}\) is independent of \({X}_{t}^{j}\). Then we calculate the fraction \(\pi\) of \({{{{{\mathcal{S}}}}}}\) that contains \({X}_{t}^{k}\). Since a collider (i.e., common effect) would falsely open the link between \(({X}_{t-\tau }^{i},{X}_{t}^{j})\) (which turns to spurious link) if it were conditioned on, \({{{{{\mathcal{S}}}}}}\) is not assumed to contain any collider of the pair \(({X}_{t-\tau }^{i},{X}_{t}^{j})\) when they are conditionally independent given \({{{{{\mathcal{S}}}}}}\). Thus, \(\pi\) could be an indicator of the possibility that \({X}_{t}^{k}\) is not a collider. Finally, we use the “majority” rule to decide the existence of colliders (see details in this paper17). The considered structure is oriented as a triple of collider when \(\pi < 0.5\), as unoriented when \(\pi > 0.5\), and as ambiguous when \(\pi=0.5\).We further determine link directions for the remaining contemporaneous links with three complementary rules. Rule #1 (R1) is to avoid “colliders”, since all the colliders are assumed to be already recognized in the collider-hunting stage. For all remaining unshielded structure \({X}_{t-\tau }^{i}\to {X}_{t}^{k}-{X}_{t}^{j}\), orient it as a chain. Rule #2 (R2) is to avoid “cycles” (assuming no feedback loops in the system; colloquially, a variable cannot be its own descendant), which is a tacit assumption when drawing DAGs. For multi-path motifs including \({X}_{t}^{i}\to {X}_{t}^{k}\to {X}_{t}^{j}\) with \({X}_{t}^{i}-{X}_{t}^{j}\), orient it as \({X}_{t}^{i}\to {X}_{t}^{j}\). Rule #3 (R3) is to avoid both “colliders” and “cycles”. For structures including \({X}_{t}^{i}-{X}_{t}^{k}\to {X}_{t}^{j}\) and \({X}_{t}^{i}-{X}_{t}^{l}\to {X}_{t}^{j}\) where pair \(({X}_{t}^{l},{X}_{t}^{k})\) is independent (i.e., not linked) but pair \(({X}_{t}^{i},{X}_{t}^{j})\) is of an unoriented link, then orient it as \({X}_{t}^{i}\to {X}_{t}^{j}\).Finally, under the standard assumptions of Causal Markov, (adjacency) Faithfulness, causal sufficiency, and causal stationarity (see detailed explanations in Table S1)18,68,71,72, the output of PCMCI+ algorithms can be interpreted as the causal network structure of the system, conveniently depicted by a directed (or partially directed) acyclic graph (DAG) composed of nodes (representing random variables) and directed edges (representing causal relations). Note that contemporaneous links can remain unoriented indicating the Markov equivalence class or due to conflicting orientation rules. The node color denotes the autocorrelation (labeled “auto-MCI”), varying from 0 to 1, at the lag with maximum absolute value. The link color stands for the sign (i.e., negative or positive) and strength of the connection estimated by MCI test (labeled “cross-MCI”) varying from −1 to 1. Straight and curved edges represent the contemporaneous and lagged causal links, respectively; if multiple lagged links occur between paired variables, the color of link will embody the strongest one but with numeric labels indicating all significant lags sorted by cross-MCI values.GLMWe applied a conventional time-series regression analysis using generalized linear model (GLM) to estimate the association of O3, AH, and T with influenza activity within each state. Since influenza activity is proportion data, a quasi-Binomial link with logit (i.e., \(\log \left(\frac{Y}{1-Y}\right)\)) function that is arguably a reasonable choice, was adopted73. By analogy with GLM regression, the target variable “Flu” (i.e., influenza activity) was logit-transformed in EDM and PCMCI+ analyses as well, which could give us an overall interpretation benchmark. Besides, due to exponential transmission pattern of influenza cases, such scale transformation can help discern small differences in influenza activity. To modulate the case when \(Y\) takes a value of 0, a random small number (i.e., 25% to 100% of non-zero minimum “Flu” level for each specific influenza season) was added to allow for defined transformation. To filter out the potential confounding effect of unmeasured variables, we included dummy variables for the year to capture the secular trend, and dummy variables for each month of a year to capture seasonality in the model. To account for strong autocorrelation caused by disease transmission, we took the logarithm of 1-week lagged outcome variable (i.e., \(\log \left({Y}_{t-1}\right)\)) as another covariate in the model, which was provably able to match the likely mechanism better (so named “transmission term”) and predict outcomes with reduced residual dispersion74.When estimating the relationship of O3 with influenza, the same-week AH and T are simultaneously included in the model as a linear term to control for confounding. The regression coefficient estimates together with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed for exposures at lag 0, lag 1, and lag 2 (in weeks), respectively, for each state. The state-wise and lag-specific effect estimates were pooled with a random-effects meta-analysis (using restricted maximum-likelihood estimator for the between-study variance)75, with the statistical significance threshold set stringently as \(1.0\times {10}^{-3}\).Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.

While this alleviates immediate pressure on the Region’s health systems from influenza, preparations are ongoing for the next flu season, and experts are vigilant about a virus of pandemic potential. Nicola Lewis, Director of the Worldwide Influenza Centre at the Francis Crick Institute in London, United Kingdom, is frank about the risks flu poses: “I think the chances that disease X will be an influenza virus are probably greater than for any other known pathogen group that I can think of,” she says. Disease X is a term used to describe a hypothetical novel or unknown disease that could cause another pandemic.The Francis Crick Institute is one of 7 WHO collaborating centres responsible for analysing influenza viruses circulating in the human population. They characterize flu strains and use this information to inform risk assessment and vaccine development, both for seasonal influenza and for strains with pandemic potential. The Institute is part of the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS), which consists of over 150 laboratories and institutions worldwide.Adapting vaccines to changes in seasonal influenzaCurrently, annual epidemics of seasonal influenza cause up to 650 000 deaths globally; as many as 72 000 – about 11% – of these occur in the Region, mainly among people at higher risk of severe disease, including older people, those with chronic heart or lung diseases, children under the age of 5 years and pregnant women. The seasonal flu vaccine is a safe and effective way to reduce the severity of infections. To tailor the vaccine to circulating variants, twice a year WHO organizes consultations with an advisory group of experts gathered from WHO collaborating centres and WHO Essential Regulatory Laboratories that analyse influenza virus surveillance data generated by GISRS. The recommendations issued are used by national vaccine regulatory agencies and pharmaceutical companies to develop, produce and license influenza vaccines for the following influenza season. Since the influenza season coincides with the autumn/winter season in the northern hemisphere, and manufacture and distribution take time, the Composition of Influenza Virus Vaccines recommendation meeting is organized in February. “The recommendation meeting is at the end of a very long effort undertaken by the GISRS network, made up of 151 national influenza centres in over 129 Member States,” says Nicola. “The national influenza centres take receipt of clinical specimens that are positive for influenza viruses, and they start the process of analysing them,” she explains. “Then they share these specimens with the 7 WHO collaborating centres, including the one in London, who then take up the baton to analyse the genetic sequences and the antigenic properties of these viruses (the immune response in individuals).”The WHO collaborating centres take this information to the recommendation meeting where they spend a week examining the data presented before advising on the human seasonal influenza strains that should be countered through tailored vaccine production.“Flu changes constantly and our job as collaborating centres, underpinned by the huge amount of work done by the national influenza centres, is to make sure that we understand how the viruses are evolving. The seasonal flu vaccine is an essential part of our armoury in helping to protect the human population.”Influenza spillover from animalsAt the Composition of Influenza Virus Vaccines recommendation meetings, experts also analyse viruses that are circulating in animal populations to prepare candidate vaccine viruses that could become a crucial countermeasure in the face of another pandemic.“One of the aspects of flu that is fascinating is that it is continuously evolving, which means that it's able to escape prior immunity that we might have to a particular flu virus,” says Nicola. “Flu viruses can also undergo what we call re-assortment, which happens when 2 different flu viruses infect a person or infect a pig at the same time. They shuffle their genetic material so that the progeny flu virus that comes out of the pig or the human is actually different.”Pigs represent the ideal mixing vessel in which flu can mutate, since they can catch influenza from birds and humans. Periodically, viruses from specific animal populations spill over into other animal populations, or into humans, where they can cause severe damage. They sometimes cause single infections, but they have the potential to cause a pandemic.Preparing for a potential pandemicHighly pathogenic avian influenza is on the radar due to its recent rapid evolution and its ongoing detection in cattle in the United States of America. It is often lethal to domestic poultry, but so far not easily transmissible to humans. Since 2020, strains of the virus have spread globally through wild bird hosts – throughout Eurasia as well as into Africa, North and South America, and even Antarctica. As well as killing many millions of wild and domesticated birds, including poultry raised for human consumption, highly pathogenic avian influenza has also shown itself to be transmissible and dangerous to mammals such as tigers, foxes, mink and fur seals. Infections in mammals are particularly concerning because they can create the potential for mutations that increase the risk of mammal-to-mammal spread and transmission to or among humans.“We have never seen this kind of situation with a highly pathogenic H5 virus before. I certainly think that if you'd asked me in 2019, this would not have been the picture I would have conjured up in my mind about what bird flu could do,” Nicola notes.Researchers at the Worldwide Influenza Centre at the Francis Crick Institute are committed to understanding these evolutionary changes to support global preparedness efforts for a potential pandemic from flu viruses. Nicola stresses that frameworks such as GISRS, so critical to global pandemic preparedness, are dependent on trusting, collaborative partnerships and the sharing of near real-time information. She urges Member States currently negotiating the Pandemic Accord ahead of the 77th World Health Assembly to work together for the benefit of all.“My message to international communities is that we have to set aside our reticence. We have to set aside our parochial concerns and remember the impacts and the devastating consequences of a global pandemic from whatever disease agent it comes from.” Related Global influenza surveillance and response system (GISRS)WHO collaborating centres News “This is about all of us” – an interview with Roland Driece, co-chair of the Bureau of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Body of the Pandemic Accord 19 March 2024 Quick links Newsroom Emergencies About us » European Programme of Work Publications Campaigns Help » Contact us Careers Cyber Security Privacy Subscribe to our newsletters Privacy Legal Notice © 2024 WHOAvian Influenza County Offices to Close for Veterans Day Holiday SanDiegoCounty.gov Home Departments A-C Agriculture, Weights and Measures Aging & Independence Services Animal Services Assessor/Recorder/County Clerk Auditor/Controller Behavioral Health Services Chief Administrative Office Child and Family Well-Being Child Support Services Citizens Law Enforcement Review Board Civil Service Commission Clerk of the Board of Supervisors Communications Office County Counsel D-H District Attorney Economic Development and Government Affairs Emergency Services Environmental Health and Quality Equity and Racial Justice Ethics and Compliance Finance and General Government Group County Fire General Services Grand Jury Health & Human Services Agency Homelessness Solutions and Equitable Communities Housing and Community Development Human Resources J-P Labor Standards and Enforcement Land Use and Environment Group Library Medical Care Services Medical Examiner Parks and Recreation Planning & Development Services Probation Public Defender Public Health Public Safety Group Public Works Purchasing and Contracting R-Z Registrar of Voters Self-Sufficiency Services Sheriff Technology Office Treasurer/Tax Collector UC Cooperative Extension I Want To...

Last updated 10/4/2024. Avian influenza (H5N1 Bird Flu) is a disease caused by infection with a type of flu virus. These viruses occur among water birds, like ducks and geese. They can also spread to domestic poultry, like chickens and turkeys, in addition to wild and domestic mammals. Although avian flu does not usually make people sick, there have been some rare cases. The current outbreaks of H5N1 in U.S. poultry were first detected in the United States in January 2022 with detections in dairy cows in 2024. While the current public health risk is low, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is watching the situation carefully and working with states to monitor people with animal exposures. See below, or click the following links, to learn more about: Prevention Exposure Transmission (spread) Symptoms Diagnosis Treatment Resources Avian Influenza in Birds Avian Influenza in Pets and Other Animals Infographic Prevention There is no vaccine for humans to prevent avian flu spread. Seasonal flu vaccines will not prevent infection with avian flu viruses. The best prevention is to avoid sources of exposure whenever possible. Wild birds can be infected with avian flu even if they do not look sick. Avoid unprotected exposure to sick or dead animals, including animal feces, litter, or materials contaminated by birds or other animals with suspected or confirmed bird flu infection. Do not touch surfaces that may be contaminated by wild or domestic birds, or other animals, with suspected or confirmed avian flu. Properly handle and cook poultry and beef to the appropriate temperatures to kill bacteria and viruses. Do not consume raw milk. Bird owners and/or people who have backyard or hobbyist flocks should practice steps to prevent disease from getting to healthy animals (biosecurity). Visit Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (usda.gov) to learn more about biosecurity. Should those with work or recreational exposures encounter an infected, or potentially infected, animal, they should take the following precautions: If you observe an unusual number of sick or dead birds in your flock contact the Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) Sick Bird Hotline: 1-866-922-2473 If you suspect other animals such as livestock are infected with avian influenza contact the Department of Food and Agriculture Ontario Office; (909) 947-5932 Use personal protective equipment (PPE), such as gloves, an N95 respirator or well-fitted mask, fluid resistant coveralls, rubber boots, and eye protection (e.g., goggles or face shield). Wash hands with soap and water after touching birds. Avoid touching your mouth, nose, or eyes after contact with birds, surfaces, or materials that may be contaminated. Change clothes after handling infected, or potentially infected, birds and other animals. Then, throw away the gloves and mask, and wash your hands with soap and water. Demonstrations of how to use PPE: For dairy workers: For poultry workers: Exposure People who become sick within 10 days of their exposure to infected, or potentially infected, birds or other animals should isolate at home. Monitor your health for symptoms of avian influenza. Separate from others, including household members, and do not go to work or school until the results of your test are confirmed. If you have been exposed to avian flu, your health department will also reach out to inform you of the exposure. A reminder, most of the signs and symptoms of avian flu overlap with those of other respiratory illnesses, such as COVID-19 and seasonal influenza. Visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) What to Know About Bird Flu for information for different groups of people who become sick after contact with infected birds. If You Find a Sick or Dead Wild Bird or Other Animal: Avoid unprotected exposure to sick or dead animals, including animal feces, litter, or materials contaminated by birds or other animals. Use PPE, such as gloves, a well-fitting mask, and eye protection. Wash your hands with soap and water. Contact the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. Sick wildlife can be rehabilitated by the San Diego Humane Society’s Project Wildlife program. Transmission (Spread) Types of birds that can be infected with avian flu include: Waterbirds (ducks, geese, swans); Shorebirds (storks); and/or Poultry (chickens, turkeys). Avian flu viruses may spread from infected birds to other animals, and potentially to humans, in two (2) main ways: Directly, from exposure to saliva, mucous, or feces from infected birds, and/or eating an infected bird. Through an intermediate host, such as another animal. Infections among people are rare. However, people can get sick when enough virus gets into a person’s eyes, nose, or mouth, or it is inhaled (breathed in). This can happen through direct and unprotected contact with infected birds and their contaminated environment. The spread of avian flu from one infected person to a close contact is very rare. However, monitoring human infection and person-to-person spread is very important for public health in the possibility that the virus could change and gain the ability to spread easily between people. Symptoms Illness from avian flu can range from no symptoms, mild symptoms, to severe illness. Mild symptoms include: Eye redness, and/or Mild flu-like upper respiratory symptoms. Severe symptoms include: Pneumonia requiring hospitalization, Fever, Cough, Runny or stuffy nose, Headache, Muscle or body aches, Sore throat, Fatigue, and/or Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing. Less common signs and symptoms include diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, or seizures. Diagnosis If avian flu is suspected, a doctor should consider the following factors: Overall health and medical history, Signs and symptoms, Exposure to birds/poultry, and Occupation (e.g., farmers/workers, veterinarians, veterinary staff, emergency staff), and Lifestyle (e.g., backyard bird flock owners). Laboratory testing is also needed. Avian flu infection is usually diagnosed by collecting a swab from the nose or throat of the sick person. Testing is more accurate when the swab is collected during the first few days of being sick. Treatment People with avian flu infection are recommended to be treated as soon as possible with antiviral drugs. Antiviral treatment works best if started as soon as symptoms begin within the 10 days of exposure.

Their approach worked well in experiments with mice and ferrets and may lead to more broadly-protective influenza vaccines and less reliance on an annual shot tailored to that year’s versions of the virus. Even with vaccines, influenza kills about a half-million people each year around the world. This new vaccine approach, described May 1 in the journal Science Translational Medicine, is part of a 5-year-old effort to develop a longer-lasting universal flu vaccine that would be able to foil all versions of the virus. Influenza strains are referred to by a shorthand code, H5N1 for example, that describes which flavors of two particular surface proteins it carries. The H (sometimes HA), is hemagglutinin, a lollipop-shaped protein that binds to a receptor on a human cell, the first step toward getting the virus inside the cell. The N is neuraminidase, a second protein that enables a newly made virus to escape the host cell and go on to infect other cells. “On the virus particle, there's five to 10 times more hemagglutinin than neuraminidase,” said Nicholas Heaton, PhD, an associate professor of molecular genetics and microbiology at Duke who led the research. “If we took your blood to see if are you likely to be protected from a strain of flu, we'd be measuring what your antibodies do to hemagglutinin as the best metric of what's likely to happen to you. The strongest correlates of protection have to do with hemagglutinin-directed immunity.” Vaccines teach the immune system to react to pieces of the virus that have been specifically tailored to the versions of influenza that are expected to be the most threatening in the coming flu season. The reason we need a new flu shot every fall isn’t because the vaccine wears out; it’s because the influenza virus is constantly changing the surface proteins that vaccines target. Flu shots -- and immune systems -- tend to target the bulb-like “head” of hemagglutinin rather than the stalk. But the details of that head region also change constantly, creating an arms race between vaccine design and viruses. The stalk, by comparison, changes much less. “A number of groups have gone through and experimentally mutagenized the whole hemagglutinin and asked ‘which areas can change and still allow the hemagglutinin to function?’” Heaton explained. “And the answer is, you can't really change the stalk and expect it to continue to function.” So the Duke team sought to design proteins that elicit an immune response more focused on the stalk rather than the head. “The virus has evolved to have the immune system recognize these (features on the head region). But these are the shapes the virus can change. That is an insidious strategy,” Heaton said. Using gene-editing, they created more than 80,000 variations of the hemagglutinin protein with changes in one portion right on the top of the head domain and then tested a vaccine filled with a mixture of these variations on mice and ferrets. Because of the broad variety of head conformations being presented to the immune system and the relative consistency of the stalks, these vaccines produced more antibodies to the stalk portion of hemagglutinin in response. “The opportunity for the immune system to see that (head portion) over and over and over, like it needs to, is compromised because there's diversity there,” Heaton said. In lab tests and animals, the experimental vaccine caused the immune system to respond more strongly to stalk regions because they stayed consistent. This boosted the immune response to the vaccine overall, and in some cases, even improved antibody responses to the head region of the protein as well. “Antibodies against the stalk work differently,” Heaton said. “Their mechanism of protection is not necessarily to block the first step of infection. So then our idea was, ‘What if we can come up with a vaccine that gives us both? What if we can get good head antibodies and at the same time also get stalk antibodies in case the vaccine selection was wrong, or if there's a pandemic?’” “Essentially, the paper says, Yes, we can accomplish that,” Heaton said. After a shot of the highly variant vaccine was administered in some experiments, 100 percent of the mice avoided illness or death from what should have been a lethal dose of flu viruses. The next steps of the research will attempt to understand whether the same level of immunity can be achieved by presenting fewer than 80,000 hemagglutinin variants. This research was funded in part with a contract from the NIH/National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (75N93019C00050). It also involved the use of the Duke Regional Biocontainment Laboratory, which received partial support for construction from the NIH/NIAID (UC6 AI058607) Zhaochen Luo and Nicholas Heaton have a patent on the methods used to create large antigen libraries for this study.

In Chile, lethal H5N1 cases have been reported in a wide range of wild bird species, marine mammals, backyard and industrial poultry, and humans. This study describes the spatio-temporal patterns of the current epizootic of H5N1 in Chile and test drivers that could be associated with outbreak occurrence. Methods: We used H5N1 cases reported by the Chilean National Animal Health Authority from 5 December 2022 to 5 April 2023. These included wild bird cases confirmed through an avian influenza-specific real-time reverse transcription PCR assay (RT-qPCR), obtained from passive and active surveillance. Data were analyzed to detect the presence of H5N1 clusters under space–time permutation probability modeling, the association of H5N1 with distance and days since the first outbreak through linear regression, and the correlation of H5N1 presence with a number of ecological and anthropogenic variables using general linear modeling. Results: From 445 H5N1 identified outbreaks involving 613 individual cases in wild birds, a consistent wave-like spread of H5N1 from north to south was identified, which may help predict hotspots of outbreak risk. For instance, seven statistically significant clusters were identified in central and northern Chile, where poultry production and wildlife mortality are concentrated. The presence of outbreaks was correlated with landscape-scale variables, notably temperature range, bird richness, and human footprint. Discussion: In less than a year, H5N1 has been associated with the unusual mortality of >100,000 individuals of wild animals in Chile, mainly coastal birds and marine mammals. It is urgent that scientists, the poultry sector, local communities, and national health authorities co-design and implement science-based measures from a One Health perspective to avoid further H5N1 spillover from wildlife to domestic animals and humans, including rapid removal and proper disposal of wild dead animals and the closure of public areas (e.g., beaches) reporting high wildlife mortalities. 1 Introduction The current panzootic of highly pathogenic avian influenza A subtype H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b (hereafter H5N1) is causing widespread mortality among wild birds and mammals worldwide (1–3). In addition, more than half a billion poultry have died or been culled as a control measure (4), threatening the food security of low- and middle-income countries. First described in the Netherlands in October 2020, the novel H5N1 virus bearing the clade 2.3.4.4b HA gene (5) originated from reassorted avian influenza H1N1, H3N8, and H5N8 viruses (5–7). This novel H5N1 virus has spread rapidly through major avian migratory pathways to every continent except Australia (7–10). Recently, evidence of H5N1 infection associated with mortality in wild birds and mammals has confirmed its arrival in Antarctica (11, 12). Although it has major impacts on wild and domestic birds, the unusually high and growing number of lethal cases among marine and terrestrial mammals, especially in Europe and the Americas, is a hallmark of the current emergency (2, 13–16). Unprecedented mammal-to-mammal transmission has been increasingly suspected. For instance, Agüero et al. (17) described the mortality of several thousand farmed American minks (Neogale vison) in northern Spain following a rapid pen-to-pen pattern of spread. Furthermore, spillover has affected people, with 10 cases of H5N1 human infections reported since January 2022, two of them fatal, fueling fears of the emergence of a new global pandemic with unknown consequences (18, 19). In Chile, the Agriculture and Livestock Service (SAG) reported the first case of H5N1 in a Peruvian pelican (Pelecanus thagus) found dead on 5 December 2022, in the northern coastal city of Arica. This case was confirmed using a specific real-time reverse transcription PCR assay (hereafter RT-qPCR), as described by Ariyama et al. (20). This occurred a few weeks after Peru reported mass mortalities of >22,000 marine birds (mainly P. thagus), presumably due to avian influenza (1). Two months later, Chile reported the first case of backyard poultry in the coastal town of Chañaral de Aceituno, followed by the first confirmed cases in marine mammals in a South American sea lion (Otaria flavescens) and a marine otter (Lontra felina), also in the North of the country. Subsequently, the first outbreak of industrial poultry in Central Chile was reported in March 2023 (in the city of Rancagua), where the country’s poultry production is concentrated. Later, on 29 March, the Ministry of Health reported Chile’s first human case of H5N1 in a 53-year-old man from the coastal city of Tocopilla in northern Chile, raising the possibility of this panzootic becoming a serious threat to public health. Despite multiple non-pathogenic and highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses circulating across the globe for decades and previous Influenza A pandemics, including H1N1 Spanish flu (1918) and H1N1 swine flu (2009), there is still a lack of understanding of the factors contributing to the wide and rapid spread of the novel H5N1 virus, particularly given its high mortality and diverse range of infected hosts. A better understanding of the ecology of H5N1 is urgently needed to inform effective strategies for disease surveillance and control in Chile and elsewhere. This study describes the spatio-temporal patterns of the current epizootic of H5N1 in Chile and tests ecological and anthropogenic drivers that may be associated with outbreak occurrence to help predict and prevent areas of high risk for future outbreaks in wildlife, domestic poultry, and potential cases in humans. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Virus surveillance We used cases of H5N1 in wild birds reported from 5 December 2022 to 5 April 2023 by the Chilean National Animal Health Authority (21, 22) to the World Animal Health Information System (WAHIS) platform (4). These cases were tested by RT-qPCR using the VetMAX-Gold AIV Detection Kit (Applied Biosystems/Thermo Fisher Scientific 4,485,261), which targets the avian influenza M gene. Positive samples were confirmed by a specific H5 RT-qPCR assay (20). The samples were obtained from passive and active surveillance that included live and dead wild birds, backyard production birds, and industrial poultry. Sampling typically consisted of oral, tracheal, or cloacal swabs, but also included tissues when available from dead animals (20). From each record, we obtained species, date, geographical coordinates, condition (dead or alive), and whether the animals were killed or disposed. An outbreak was considered one entered line on the WAHIS system, and the total number of positive/suspected cases was considered in the number of cases per outbreak. 2.2 H5N1 spatio-temporal cluster analysis Visualization of H5N1 outbreak locations was generated using QuantumGIS v.3.3 (23) and projected for analysis using the WGS 1984 datum as the coordinate system. Each sampled site was considered an H5N1 outbreak if at least one individual swab sample tested positive, according to the results of the specific RT-qPCR. First, spatial distribution was characterized by the global Moran’s I index (24), to identify spatial autocorrelation among the data. Then, we used the scan statistic (25) to detect any cluster of H5N1 outbreaks under space–time permutation probability modeling. The model was run using H5N1 locations under the null hypothesis that outbreaks were randomly distributed across the country. The model was set to scan for areas with high H5N1-positive numbers to test for clusters with a spatial occurrence higher than that outside the cluster. The model allowed the detection of the most “unusual” excess of observed H5N1 outbreaks and therefore provided georeferenced high-risk areas of H5N1 occurrence. Likelihood ratio distributions were obtained using the Monte Carlo simulation by generating 999 replications of the data set under the null hypothesis of a random distribution of cases in time and space (26). The analysis was performed using SatScan v.10.1 software, considering a p-value of <0.05 as statistically significant (27). 2.3 Ecological and anthropogenic H5N1 drivers We first tested the association between distance and days since the first outbreak through a linear regression model. We also tested the correlation between the presence or absence of H5N1 outbreaks in wild birds and several ecological and anthropogenic variables that could be related to disease occurrence or reporting. For this purpose, we built a global model including all 19 bioclimatic variables from WorldClim at a spatial resolution of 30-s (~1 km2) (28), after checking that there were no major discontinuities with these variables in our study area (29). We also included a variable of bird richness obtained from the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species (30). To test whether H5N1 was more likely to occur in areas with high human presence or activity, our model included one of the three variables considered proxies of human activity: the human footprint as cumulative human pressure on the environment (31), human density, or total human population obtained from the global high-resolution population denominators project (32). Finally, the distance of the outbreak to the nearest urban center and the nearest SAG office were included as proxies of reporting effort, as distance to the reporting office may be negatively correlated with the probability of reporting (33). We extracted all data for each H5N1 outbreak to coordinates using raster layers of 30 s (~1 km2) spatial resolution with QuantumGIS v.3.3. Supplementary Table S1 details each assessed variable and data source. We built a generalized linear model (GLM) with a binomial error structure (link = logit) to test the association between the H5N1 presence/absence model and the variables described above using the multGLM function in the fuzzySim R 4.2.1package. This function allowed us to previously test correlations between variables (particularly bioclimatic variables) and exclude them from the analyses to avoid collinearity problems. The model was set to test correlations using a rho >0.8 and a significance of p-value <0.05, retaining the variable that was more informative to the response variable. The reporting data for H5N1 only included H5N1 “presence” data, and no reports of H5N1 “absence” were available (e.g., reports of healthy birds that tested negative for H5N1). Thus, in order to include H5N1 “absence” points in our GLM binomial model, we created “pseudo-absence” points, i.e., locations where H5N1 was not reported, and from which all environmental/human variables used in the model were extracted. Pseudo-absence points were randomly selected within a 50-km radius buffer from the coordinates of reported outbreaks, which we assumed was a realistic radius of movement for wild bird species. From each pseudo-absence location, we extracted all the data above for H5N1 outbreaks. We selected a total of 445 points, representing 1 randomly selected point per outbreak location within a 50-km radius buffer. We ran the full model with all variables, excluding correlated variables according to the model (bioclim variables bio1, bio4, bio5, bio6, bio8, bio9, bio10, bio11, bio12, bio13, bio14, bio15, bio16, and bio17) and used the dredge function from the MuMIn package to select the model with the lowest AICc. Independent models using similar variables (e.g., three variables of human activities) were tested independently, and the model was selected based on its AIC. Model fit was evaluated using the DHARMa package (testOutliers, testDispersion, and qqplot functions) in R. The significance of spatial autocorrelation in the residuals of the full model was tested using Moran’s I test (34) in the spdep package, and no significant autocorrelation was found. 3 Results 3.1 H5N1 occurrence and species affected A total of 445 outbreaks, involving 613 individual wild birds of 36 species, tested positive for H5N1 in Chile. Most outbreaks involved P. thagus (n = 118, 27%), followed by Peruvian boobies (Sula variegata; 99, 22%), guanay cormorants (Phalacrocorax bougainvillea; 58, 13%), and kelp gulls (Larus dominicanus; 39, 9%). Among marine mammals, O. flavescens predominated, with 28 reported outbreaks (not included in the analyses). Affected threatened species included the endangered Humboldt penguins (Spheniscus humboldti) and L. felina, with four and two outbreaks, respectively. Details of reported H5N1 outbreaks and individual cases among wild birds and marine mammals are presented in Figure 1. Figure 1 Figure 1. Highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 occurrence in wildlife in Chile. Histogram showing a number of (A) outbreaks and (B) individual cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 in wild birds (red bars) and marine mammals (gray bars) in Chile between December 2022 and April 2023. 3.2 H5N1 spatio-temporal cluster analysis Our space–time permutation analysis detected seven statistically significant clusters of H5N1 outbreaks, following a pattern in which the progression to the south of the H5N1 epidemic wave can be observed (Figure 2 and Supplementary Table S2). Space–time clusters were scattered from the extreme north to central Chile and ranged from 6 to 17 individual H5N1-positive birds in each. One of the clusters had a radius of <1 km, while the remaining six had a variable radius of 2 to 49 km. Three clusters (#1, 2, and 6) were located in central Chile, close to the most densely populated area in the country. The largest clusters had a radius of >45 km and were located in central (#1) and north Chile (#3 and 7). The city of Tocopilla is situated between two nearby clusters (#3 and 5), and it is the location where the first human case of H5N1 was reported later (Figure 2B). The other two initial cases in the backyard and industrial poultry were also predicted by clusters (#4 and 6, respectively). The Global Moran’s I index was statistically non-significant (p = 0.2), indicating that there is no spatial autocorrelation of the data. Figure 2 Figure 2.

Larger clusters are represented by green-shaded circles and are detailed in the insets. (B) Distribution of all confirmed outbreaks of H5N1 in Chile, including wild birds, marine mammals, backyard and industrial poultry, and a human. 3.3 Ecological and anthropogenic H5N1 drivers A strong linear relationship was found between time and distance from the first outbreak (Figure 3), suggesting a wave-like steady spread from north to south. The linear relationship was high (R2 = 0.76) when using the grid’s centroids. Furthermore, the presence of H5N1 outbreaks in birds was correlated with several ecological and human-related variables. The presence of H5N1 was positively correlated with bird richness, human footprint (also population density or human total population, but with a lower model fit), distance to SAG’s office, and mean diurnal range (bio2; GLM, p < 0.05). In contrast, the presence of H5N1 was negatively correlated with the distance to the closest urban center, isothermality (bio3), temperature annual range (bio7), precipitation of the warmest quarter (bio18), and coldest quarter (bio19; GLM, p < 0.05, Figure 4 and Supplementary Table S3).

However, its spatio-temporal dynamics, the epidemiological role of affected hosts, and factors associated with outbreaks remain poorly understood. In this study, we described the dynamics of the outbreaks reported in Chile, showing several clusters across the country, a wave-like spread from north to south likely generated by the arrival of migratory birds in the spring, and several ecological and human variables associated with outbreaks, from which recommendations for disease management and future research are provided. Outbreaks involving highly pathogenic avian influenza H5 viruses in domestic birds have been well-known in Europe, North America, Asia, and Africa over the last century, causing vast economic losses (7). Since 1996, H5N1 has been reassorting with low pathogenic avian influenza viruses circulating in both domestic and wild bird populations, first in Southeast Asia, but since 2005, spreading to the rest of Asia, Europe, and Africa through migratory birds (38). In these regions, H5N1 has caused recurrent mortalities among poultry, wild birds, and humans, highlighting the significance of continued surveillance and understanding of the epidemiology of this highly lethal disease (5). Our analyses show that the novel H5N1 virus has spread fast across Chile, causing high mortality in a diverse range of species. In 4 months, the virus spread 4,000 km along the Pacific flyway in Chile, with infection to date being reported in 51 wild birds, 4 domestic birds, and 5 marine mammal species (21, 22). Unprecedented mortalities of over 100,000 wild animals (80,000 wild birds and 20,000 marine mammals) have been documented in Chile since December 2022 (21, 22). This epidemic pattern is similar to the one observed in North America, where the virus spread rapidly throughout the continental United States and all provinces of Canada, affecting more than 28,000 wild birds based on disease and mortality estimates (39). A similar situation occurred in Peru, where more than 200,000 wild birds (37) and 5,200 marine mammals (14) have died since October 2022. In addition, in the United States, H5N1 has been associated with high mortality rates and breeding failure in the bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) and with unusual mortalities in the highly threatened California condor (Gymnogyps californianus), thus far killing 6% of the wild population (40). Likewise, the arrival of H5N1 to Tierra del Fuego in the extreme south of Chile is currently an imminent threat to Antarctic fauna. In continental Chile alone, >3,000 S. humboldti have died from suspected H5N1 since January 2023 (22). There is no information available on why this species appears to be so susceptible to the virus. Genetic sequencing of Chilean H5N1 samples indicates that they all cluster together within the clade 2.3.4.4b (20, 41, 42), suggesting that the outbreaks in the country all belong to the same viral lineage (with potentially minor variations) that is globally widespread. This virus arrived in Chile from neighboring Peru, and previously from North America (2, 36). This wave-like spread is likely associated with the movement of wild birds, although no information is currently available on the host species disseminating the virus across space in South America. Although pelicans, boobies, gulls, and cormorants have been the most affected species in Chile and Peru (1, 37), ducks and teals are recognized as reservoirs and spreaders of avian influenza in other regions (43–45) and given that the movement behavior of most of these species lacks large-scale migrations, it is unknown which species are responsible for the observed pattern of spread in Chile (46, 47). Thus, further research combining spatial ecology and genetic analyses could help solve this relevant question. Studies have shown that the black-headed gull (L. ridibundus) in Europe is highly susceptible to avian influenza, likely contributing to local transmission rather than long-distance spread due to their high mortality to H5N1 (48). Gulls are among the bird species most involved in outbreaks in Chile. The largely sedentary behavior and high-density aggregations in colonies during breeding exhibited by L. dominicanus and Belcher’s gull (L. belcheri) suggest that these species may act as competent H5N1 reservoirs, contributing to virus persistence in areas such as our identified clusters. The situation is different for the gray gull (L. modestus), as its migratory condition could help spread H5N1 along much of the Pacific flyway within South America (49). Due to their scavenging habits and migratory behavior in the Americas, turkey vultures (Cathartes aura) could also contribute to the spread of H5N1 (37). Conversely, Anseriformes were involved in few outbreaks in Chile, despite being recognized as key hosts in the epidemiology of avian influenza viruses, both as reservoirs (40, 45, 50–52) or as long-distance spreaders (53). As previously shown for a wide variety of low pathogenic avian influenza viruses in Chile (52, 54), it is possible that as H5N1 becomes ezootic, and with Anseriformes start playing more relevant epidemiological roles, such as acting as virus reservoirs (6, 44) or even suffering the consequences of disease (53). For instance, the unusual mortality of approximately 800 black-necked swans (Cygnus melancoryphus) in a wetland in Valdivia (southern Chile) associated with H5N1 is of high concern (21). Our permutation space–time model was useful in identifying high-risk areas of H5N1 outbreaks, guiding efforts to focus disease monitoring and carcass removal. To date, 12 outbreaks have been reported in industrial poultry units and 175 in backyard poultry production systems in Chile, in which over 1,000,000 birds have died or been killed for disease control management (21). This is due to the high industrialization of commercial poultry production in Chile, which has high biosecurity standards, compared to backyard poultry production, which is generally developed in open areas where domestic and wild birds share the environment, thus facilitating disease transmission (55). Our spatio-temporal analyses showed that clusters occurred most frequently close to urban centers, confirming our modeling approach showing a correlation between H5N1 occurrence and human-populated areas. For example, central Chile is a major hub for chicken production in the country, where three (of seven) H5N1 clusters were identified. The location of large cities with high demand for poultry products would increase the chances of disease transmission and spread through road networks (56–59). The observed close distance from outbreaks to highway junctions (e.g., Pan-American Highway; < 30 km) is worrying since highway junctions have been considered “dissemination nodes” for influenza viruses in poultry (56–58). Industry production and trade close to urban and rural wetlands (e.g., Aconcagua River mouth) can increase the chances of infection because of the higher risk of contact between domestic waterfowl and wild birds (60). Ongoing spillover from wild birds to poultry also threatens Latin America’s food security, as the region includes some of the world’s largest poultry producers, such as Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, and Argentina (61). The wave-like spread south of the novel H5N1 in Chile allows for the prediction of new outbreaks. This can help in implementing preventive measures in farmed birds, other domestic animals, and people, or speed up mitigation actions in wild populations. For example, regular wave-like patterns of vampire bat rabies in Peru have contributed to alerting communities ahead of the spreading wave to implement preventive strategies such as vaccination (62). We also showed that the outbreak’s occurrence in wild birds was associated with several bioclimatic variables and proxies of human activities. For example, in our study, H5N1 occurrence was negatively associated with distance to urban centers and positively associated with human footprint, likely due to a lower reporting capacity and detection probability as distance from cities increases. For instance, H5N1 RT-qPCR testing in Chile is centralized in the SAG’s virology laboratory in Santiago, possibly contributing to a geographic detection bias. In fact, the same pattern did not occur when SAG offices were analyzed. In contrast, a significant positive correlation was found between H5N1 occurrence and the distance to the nearest SAG office. SAG offices are distributed along the country with a strong presence where agriculture and livestock develop, which can coincide or not with human-populated areas. For instance, many offices are located inland (including border crossings in the mountains) or in Patagonia, far from the described H5N1 outbreaks. In addition, bird species richness was positively associated with outbreaks in our study, suggesting that areas of high bird diversity can be hotspots of H5N1, as previously found for bird richness and prevalence of low pathogenic avian influenza viruses in Spanish wetlands (63). Additionally, Huang et al. (64) found that bird species richness, particularly of higher-risk species (i.e., Larus spp.), showed a positive relationship with H5N1 outbreak probabilities in wild birds in Europe. Among climatic variables, the mean diurnal range had the highest positive association with outbreaks’ occurrence (~57 times per temperature degree), while other variables including isothermality, temperature annual range, and precipitation of the warmest quarter and the coldest quarter showed a negative, but smaller, association with H5N1. These findings encourage research on ecological modeling predictions of future outbreaks, particularly for the upcoming critical winter period, which has shown a peak of H5N1 outbreaks in North America (39) and Europe (6, 65). Similarly, in a study in central Chilean wetlands based on fecal samples of wild birds, Ruiz et al. (54) found a positive association between the prevalence of low pathogenic avian influenza viruses and the minimum temperature for the month of sampling. Although previous studies in Chile have found a higher prevalence of enzootic avian influenza viruses during summer and autumn (52, 54), the current progression of the H5N1 epizootic in South America prevents testing for seasonality effects. Furthermore, as the epizootic moves inland, it is important to include in future studies the analysis of other ecological variables that might be relevant, such as vegetation coverage, the size of water bodies (54) and host density (50). The biological mechanisms behind the observed associations found in our study with several bioclimatic variables in terms of host and viral dynamics open venues for future research. One of the most worrying issues of the current panzootic is the increasing cases of H5N1 infections in wild mammals, both marine and terrestrial, causing unprecedented mass mortalities (3, 13–15, 36). The current epizootic associated with mortality in O. flavescens and L. felina, among other marine mammals, is the first report of H5N1 in these species. Worryingly, RNA sequencing has shown signs of early adaptation of the H5N1 2.3.4.4b clade virus to wild mammals (66) and humans (41), fueling fears of a new human pandemic (18). In addition, recent reports of a dog and two cats dying from H5N1 after contact with dead birds in North America (67) raise the potential of wildlife-to-dog transmission in South American countries such as Chile, where a high population of dogs (both owned and stray) occurs (68). Furthermore, additional lethal cases in domestic cats have been recently reported (69, 70). Even more, two cases of zoonotic avian influenza have recently been reported in the region [Ecuador and Chile; (41, 71)], with the Chilean case being of special concern. Here, the location of this case (Tocopilla) was predicted as a high-risk area with high precision by an earlier spatio-temporal permutation analysis. Later, by adding more (scattered) data, this case falls between two clusters in northern Chile (#3 and 5, Figure 2). The epidemiological investigation concluded that the transmission most likely occurred through environmental exposure due to the high number of dead sea lions and wild birds near the infected man’s residence (41, 72), showing the potential of H5N1 spillover to humans from wildlife even in the absence of direct contact. 5 Conclusion Our results identified a wave-like steady spreading of the novel H5N1 virus in Chile. We predicted hotspots of H5N1 risk and factors associated with outbreak occurrence, contributing to establishing targeted prevention measures to avoid further spread and spillover to other species, including humans. To date, the H5N1 epidemic has caused the death of more than 100,000 wild animals in Chile, so mitigation strategies are urgently needed to reduce the impact of this emerging disease on wildlife, including endangered species such as penguins (e.g., S. humboldti), and the imminent arrival of the virus in Antarctica. Traditionally, strategies to control avian influenza outbreaks have focused on poultry, but new and urgent efforts are needed to contain virus circulation in wild populations and the environment. Preventive actions based on our modeling approach include developing wildlife surveillance diagnostic capabilities with a focus on our predicted H5N1 high-risk areas identified by our spatio-temporal cluster analysis and general linear modeling (i.e., areas with a higher temperature, bird richness, and human footprint). It is also necessary for scientists, local communities, the poultry sector, and national health authorities to co-design and implement science-based measures from a One Health perspective to avoid further spillover to domestic animals and humans. Mitigation of H5N1 in wild populations remains a major challenge. Rapid removal and proper disposal of dead Sandwich terns (Thalasseus sandvicensis) in north-western European colonies suffering high impacts of H5N1 reduced mortality by 15% (73). Furthermore, the closure of public areas (i.e., beaches) reporting high wildlife mortalities appears to be reasonable to decrease the risk of zoonotic transmission. Likewise, target surveillance of those key wild species identified in our study, including bird banding, wetland monitoring, and citizen science, could all contribute to a better understanding of the epidemiology of H5N1. Increasing wildlife disease surveillance and genomic sequencing is also essential to better understanding cross-species transmission rates and how the virus is potentially adapting to mammals. Our study highlights the urgent need for further research to identify, alert, and prevent hotspots of H5N1 transmission, limiting the potential for a new pandemic emergence, a food security catastrophe, and further biodiversity loss.

Flu is always changing, and novel influenza viruses are always emerging. CDC programs protect the United States from seasonal influenza and pandemic flu, which occurs when a new flu virus emerges that can infect people and spread globally. Influenza is always changing Flu viruses change constantly, from season to season and sometimes during the season. Flu vaccines must be updated frequently Each year, influenza causes millions of illnesses, hundreds of thousands of hospitalizations, and tens of thousands of deaths. Download Each year, influenza causes millions of illnesses, hundreds of thousands of hospitalizations, and tens of thousands of deaths. CDC estimates that flu has resulted in 9 million – 41 million illnesses 140,000 – 710,000 hospitalizations 12,000 – 52,000 deaths annually between 2010 and 2020. Show Text Description Novel influenza viruses are always emerging Many kinds of influenza viruses spread in animals and are different from the 'seasonal' influenza viruses that normally spread in people. Influenza can spread in animals, especially in wild birds and pigs. A few animal influenza viruses can spread to people. More cases of animal flu viruses can spread to people. If a novel influenza virus spreads easily among people, and people have little immunity to it, a pandemic can occur. Animal influenza viruses can spread to people from animals such as birds or pigs. An influenza pandemic can emerge anywhere and globally Four influenza pandemics have occurred in the past 100 years. The 1918-19 flu pandemic was the most severe: killing 675,000 Americans and 50 to 100 million people worldwide. During a pandemic: medicine may be in short supply vaccines may not be readily available hospitals may be overwhelmed schools and businesses may close Estimated U.S. deaths from pandemic flu.

Show Text Description CDC protects Americans from influenza Monitoring Influenza Viruses Works with domestic and global health partners to monitor both human and animal influenza viruses to know what influenza viruses are circulating, where they are spreading, and what kind of illness they are causing. Studying Influenza Viruses in the Laboratory Studies both human and animal influenza viruses in the laboratory to better understand the characteristics of these viruses, including conducting genetic sequencing on more than 6,000 viruses each year. Improving Testing and Diagnostic Tools Develops and distributes tests and supplies materials to state, local, territorial, and international laboratories to detect and characterize influenza viruses. Leading Influenza Planning and Preparedness Supports state and local governments in preparing for the next influenza pandemic, including planning and leading pandemic exercises across all levels of government. CDC works with the World Health Organization (WHO) and partner countries in pandemic planning efforts. Domestically, CDC supports the development and use of community mitigation measures and medical countermeasures to minimize the impact of a pandemic. Supporting Vaccine Development Assists global and domestic experts who choose which viruses to include in seasonal vaccine production for each year’s vaccine and guides prioritization of pandemic vaccine development. CDC develops candidate viruses that manufacturers use to make flu vaccines. CDC tracks and monitors seasonal influenza vaccine distribution. Funding and Technical Assistance Provides direct support to state, local, and territorial public health departments for influenza surveillance and laboratory work. Globally, CDC supports more than 50 countries to build surveillance and laboratory capacity to find emerging influenza threats and respond to them. Improving Tools to Prevent and Control Evaluates the effectiveness of vaccines and drugs and updates recommendations on these. Providing Timely and Accurate Information Informs health care providers and public about influenza prevention and control measures. CDC works with businesses, schools, communities, and others to plan for and address influenza threats.

Influenza virus evades immunity by rapidly changing its surface antigens but, even when the vaccine is well matched to the current circulating virus strains, influenza vaccines are not as effective as many other vaccines. Influenza vaccine development has traditionally focused on the induction of protective antibodies, but there is mounting evidence that T cell responses are also protective against influenza. Thus, future vaccines designed to promote both broad T cell effector functions and antibodies may provide enhanced protection. As we discuss, such vaccines present several challenges that require new strategic and economic considerations. Vaccine-induced T cells relevant to protection may reside in the lungs or lymphoid tissues, requiring more invasive assays to assess the immunogenicity of vaccine candidates. T cell functions may contain and resolve infection rather than completely prevent infection and early illness, requiring vaccine effectiveness to be assessed based on the prevention of severe disease and death rather than symptomatic infection. It can be complex and costly to measure T cell responses and infrequent clinical outcomes, and thus innovations in clinical trial design are needed for economic reasons. Nevertheless, the goal of more effective influenza vaccines justifies renewed and intensive efforts.

Guidance for farm workers and employers can be found online. Updates to this page are forthcoming. May 1, 2024 EspaÃ±ol Considerations for Veterinarians: Evaluating and Handling of Cats Potentially Exposed to Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza A(H5N1) Virus What to know Veterinarians and veterinary staff, in field and clinical settings, who are working in close contact with cats who are suspected or confirmed-positive for HPAI A(H5N1) virus infection should take precautions to prevent potential unprotected exposures. Sick animals may be able to transmit influenza virus to people in their saliva, feces or droppings, and other body fluids. Human infections can occur when the virus is inhaled or gets into a person's eyes, nose, or mouth. Overview Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) virus is an influenza virus that causes what is known as “bird flu.” Although bird flu viruses mainly infect and spread among wild migratory water birds and domestic poultry, bird flu viruses have been shown to spread, although inefficiently, to mammals, including humans. HPAI A(H5N1) infections in cats have been reported in the United States, Poland, South Korea, and France. These cats demonstrated varying degrees of clinical manifestations, including respiratory and neurological signs, and some had fatal outcomes. Infection is thought to have happened via exposure to infected birds or other animals. In late March and early April 2024, Texas reported detection of HPAI A(H5N1) in several cats from several dairy farms experiencing HPAI A(H5N1) virus infections in dairy cows, suggesting the virus spread to the cats either from affected dairy cows, raw cow milk, or from wild birds associated with those farms. While it's unlikely that people would become infected with bird flu viruses through contact with an infected wild, stray, feral, or domestic cat, it is possible—especially if there is prolonged and unprotected exposure to the animal. Sick animals may be able to transmit influenza virus to people in their saliva, feces or droppings, and other body fluids. Human infections can occur when the virus is inhaled or gets into a person's eyes, nose, or mouth. This can happen when virus is in the air (in droplets or dust) and a person breathes it in, or when a person touches something that has virus on it and then touches their mouth, eyes, or nose. Veterinarians and veterinary staff, in field and clinical settings, who are working in close contact with cats who are suspected or confirmed-positive for HPAI A(H5N1) virus infection, including those who are sampling cats for HPAI A(H5N1) viruses, should take precautions to prevent potential unprotected exposures. Recommendations for Worker Protection and Use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to Reduce Exposure to Novel Influenza A Viruses Associated with Severe Disease in Humans may be adapted to veterinarians and veterinary staff who will have exposure to cats that are suspected or confirmed with HPAI A(H5N1) virus infection. Recommendations from this resource are below. Criteria for exposure are described in: Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza A(H5N1) Virus in Animals: Interim Recommendations for Prevention, Monitoring, and Public Health Investigations. Avoid unprotected close or direct physical contact with sick cats who may have been exposed to animals that tested positive for HPAI A(H5N1) virus infection. When handling or interacting with cats that might be infected with or have been exposed to bird flu viruses, veterinarians and staff should wear PPE including: Disposable or non-disposable fluid-resistant coveralls or gown*, and depending on task(s), add disposable or non-disposable waterproof apron Any NIOSH Approved® particulate respirator (e.g., N95® or greater filtering facepiece respirator, elastomeric half mask respirator with a minimum of N95 filters) Properly-fitted unvented or indirectly vented safety goggles** or a face shield if there is risk of liquid splashing onto the respirator Rubber boots or rubber boot covers with sealed seams that can be sanitized or disposable boot covers for tasks taking a short amount of time Disposable or non-disposable head cover or hair cover Disposable or non-disposable gloves * Preferably, fluid-resistant coveralls should be made of material that passes: AATCC 42 ≤ 1 g and AATCC 127 ≥ 50 cm H2O or EN 20811 ≥ 50 cm H2O; or ASTM F1670 (13.8 kPa); or ISO 16603 ≥ 3.5 kPA ** Preferably, safety goggles should conform to ANSI Z87.1 that are marked at least Z87 D3 Use particular care during aerosol-generating procedures (i.e., intubation, dental procedures). All PPE should be used in accordance with OSHA regulations found at 29 CFR 1910 Subpart I (Personal Protective Equipment) including identifying appropriate PPE based on a site-specific risk assessment. Workers must receive training on and demonstrate an understanding of when to use PPE; what PPE is necessary; what it looks like when PPE is properly fitted; how to properly put on, use, take off, dispose of, and maintain PPE; and the limitations of PPE.

The avian influenza virus, known for environmental contamination and subsequent oral infection in birds, necessitates careful consideration of alternative introduction routes during HPAI outbreaks. This study focuses on blowflies (genus Calliphora), in particular Calliphora nigribarbis, attracted to decaying animals and feces, which migrate to lowland areas of Japan from northern or mountainous regions in early winter, coinciding with HPAI season. Our investigation aims to delineate the role of blowflies as HPAI vectors by conducting a virus prevalence survey in a wild bird HPAI-enzootic area. In December 2022, 648 Calliphora nigribarbis were collected. Influenza virus RT-PCR testing identified 14 virus-positive samples (2.2% prevalence), with the highest occurrence observed near the crane colony (14.9%). Subtyping revealed the presence of H5N1 and HxN1 in some samples. Subsequent collections in December 2023 identified one HPAI virus-positive specimen from 608 collected flies in total, underscoring the potential involvement of blowflies in HPAI transmission. Our observations suggest C. nigribarbis may acquire the HPAI virus from deceased wild birds directly or from fecal materials from infected birds, highlighting the need to add blowflies as a target of HPAI vector control.

Numerous cases of HPAI infections in domestic and wild birds have been reported worldwide2,3. Particularly, the number of HPAI cases in Japan reached a record high in the 2022–2023 season. According to a report from the Japanese government agency, there were 242 cases in wild birds and 84 cases in poultry farms during that season, resulting in the culling of 17.7 million birds, despite significant efforts for prevention and control4. It is crucial to identify the pathways of infection for effective prevention.The avian influenza virus is shed not only in respiratory droplets but also in feces. Excretion into feces can lead to viral contamination of the environment such as water pools, acting as a source of oral infection in other birds5. Therefore, careful attention is given to the introduction of contaminated materials, particularly bird excrement, into poultry houses. Measures such as disinfection of footwear and vehicles, as well as prevention of entry by small animals, are implemented. In cases where HPAI occurs despite these precautions, it is necessary to consider the possibility of alternative introduction routes.Blowflies are well-known for their necrophagous habits, being attracted to deceased animals and birds to feed on decaying flesh. They are also attracted to feces, making them commonly observed insects around livestock facilities. Therefore, it is conceivable that blowflies acquire influenza viruses from the carrion of infected birds or excrement of infected birds. Indeed, HPAI viruses were detected in blowflies (Callipholara nigribarbis) collected in the vicinity of a poultry house where HPAI occurred with 20–30% virus-positive rates6. It was considered that C. nigribarbis uptakes viruses from dead poultry or their excrements.While most species of blowflies, attracted by dead animals, are active in warm seasons, C. nigribarbis migrate to lowland areas from northern or mountainous regions in early winter and become active, corresponding to the HPAI flu season7,8,9,10,11. In laboratory conditions, the infectivity of influenza virus in C. nigribarbis was maintained within 24–48 hours12. C. nigribarbis can travel 1–2 km in two days13, suggesting that once a fly ingests the virus, it can propagate infectious viruses within a range of approximately 2 km. We investigated the potential role of blowflies as a vector of HPAI by conducting a survey on the virus prevalence in blowflies in a wild bird HPAI-endemic area.We selected Izumi City in Kagoshima Prefecture, Japan, as our investigation site (Fig. 1A). Izumi City is renowned as a wintering site for cranes, with an annual observation of about 10,000 cranes, mainly Gus monacha and Antigone vipio. In the 2022–2023 season, 1600 cranes died due to HPAI, and there were successive cases of HPAI in poultry farms in the area (Fig. 1B). We established collection points in 10 sites to cover most areas of the city, including the crane colony and other areas rich in wild birds (e.g. riversides) (Fig. 1A). Blowflies were not collected around poultry farms (site K in Fig. 1) to comply with enzootic prevention measures. In December 2022, we collected a total of 755 flies, including 648 C. nigribarbis (Table 1). We dissected all the collected C. nigribarbis to test the presence of the influenza virus in their crops and intestines. As a result, we found 14 virus-positive samples among all collected C. nigribarbis (2.2% in total) in the real-time RT-PCR test. The virus prevalence was highest in the area near the crane colony (site B; 14.9%), and the virus was also detected in flies collected around the other two independent river mouths (site A; 1.4% and site D; 5.0%). This suggests that C. nigribarbis ingested viruses from infected cranes or other water birds such as ducks and coots. We also attempted to identify the subtype of the detected influenza virus with RT-PCR targeting H5 and N1 subtypes. We could identify two out of 14 samples as H5N1 subtypes (sample A1 and B3) and other two as HxN1 (sample B1 and B4) (Fig. 2). Unfortunately, we could not identify the subtypes of the other 10 samples with our primer sets, suggesting the degradation of viruses in the digestive tract of flies or the presence of other subtypes that were not targeted.Figure 1Blowfly collections and HPAI surveillance in Izumi City, Kagoshima, Japan.

Sample labels correspond to the site names in Fig. 1.Full size imageIn the subsequent season, November 2023, we conducted blowfly surveys aiming for the early detection of HPAI (Table 2). We collected 208 C. nigribarbis at sites B, D, and K, but the influenza virus was not detected in this test. However, HPAI occurred in a poultry farm in early December, despite the prior negative detections from flies in this area. Two days after the occurrence, we revisited the site (sites B and K in Fig. 1) and collected flies, but no HPAI was detected among the 148 individuals of C. nigribarbis tested. Additionally, we conducted another round of blowfly collection in mid-December as part of continuous surveillance, collecting a total of 252 C. nigribarbis collected at sites A, B, D, and K. We identified one virus-positive specimen at site B with successful isolation of HPAI virus. Subsequent virus isolation experiments confirmed the infectivity of the detected virus, and sequencing analysis revealed that the subtype of the virus was H5N1 with the typical sequence of HPAI in the HA gene (PLREKRRKR/GLFG)14. The comparison of the isolated virus sequence with other HPAI viruses found in infected cranes revealed that the HA and NA gene sequences of the blowfly-derived HPAI virus were identical to those found in cranes collected two days before and 10 days after the blowfly collection. It is worth noting that the distance between the blowfly sampling location and the site where an HPAI-infected crane was found two days earlier is 800 m. When considered alongside surveillance conducted around poultry farms, our observations suggest that C. nigribarbis may acquire HPAI viruses from deceased wild birds but rarely from poultry, likely due to the swift culling of infected poultry.Table 2 Blowfly collection and virus detection in 2023.Full size tableBlowflies represent a potential vector of HPAI, particularly in enzootic regions. The effectiveness of virus detection from flies relies heavily on the prevalence of infected and deceased wild birds. C. nigribarbis is widespread in human-populated areas across Japan, including semi-rural regions with poultry farms. Like other insects, C. nigribarbis intermittently disperses its feces, leading to environmental contamination. In this study, we focused on C. nigribarbis because it was the dominant blowfly species in our study field and the season, but we could not exclude the contribution of other necrophagous blowflies in HPAI propagation, especially in geographical areas.Although the extent of blowfly intrusion into poultry houses and their role as infection sources has not been extensively studied, it is important to pay equal attention not only to the intrusion of small animals or birds but also to the entry of flies into poultry houses15. Unfortunately, due to the lack of comparable data on virus prevalence in each vector and their invasion rates into poultry farms, we could not determine which vector poses a higher risk for HPAI transmission on poultry farms.Unlike house flies, which often originate within poultry houses and are visibly active, C. nigribarbis does not exhibit such behavior. While they may appear elusive, they can be readily captured in winter using baits or traps. Considering the possible involvement of blowflies in HPAI transmission, it would be advisable to implement fly control measures in poultry settings, such as utilizing fine mesh nets, fly traps, or insecticides.Materials and methodsFly collection, identification, and dissectionBlowflies were collected using the sweeping net method with decaying meat (horse or wild boar) or fish as bait. The collected flies were temporarily stored on ice for transportation (1–3 days) and then preserved at − 80 °C until further use. To ensure successful virus isolation, careful measures were taken to avoid freezinghawing of the collected flies in 2023. Fly species were identified using morphological keys. Crops and intestines were excised from blowflies, separated into tubes, and then crushed in a shaker with zirconia beads (3000 rpm, 1 min). The samples were subsequently centrifuged (9000 rpm, 5 min), and the supernatants (homogenates) were harvested for further analysis.Virus detectionWe adopted direct real-time RT-PCR for the detection of the alphainfluenzavirus influenzae M gene, following the procedures described elsewhere and NIID diagnostic manual for HPAI with some modifications16. The homogenated samples from flies were mixed with an equal amount of denaturing solution (20% Tween 20 and 0.04% SDS) and then incubated at 70 °C for 5 min. The denatured samples served as the template for real-time RT-PCR. We utilized the MP-29-57For and MP-183-153Rev primer set and MP-96-75ProbeAs as the probe. The reactions were prepared using PrimeScript One Step RT-PCR kit ver.2 (Takara) and analyzed in StepOnePlus real-time PCR system (Thermo Fisher Scientific).HA and NA genes were identified by RT-PCR. The homogenates with an MP gene positive result were passed through the filter to remove debris, and then RNA was isolated from filtrates. The RT-PCR was carried out with primer sets targeting H5 subtype (5′-GAARCCTCTGATTTTRRAGGATTGTAG-3′ & 5′-TYTTGATAAGCCAYACCACATTTCTGA-3′) and N1 subtype (5′-TGGGCWRTAYACAGTAAGGACAA-3′ & 5′-ATWGTCAACCAACTGRTGCCATC-3′).The influenza virus-positive specimen from December 2023 underwent further analysis at the National Institute of Animal Health, National Agriculture and Food Research Organization (Pathological Appraisal). In brief, the homogenate was inoculated into embryonated chicken eggs to confirm viral infectivity, and the sequence of HA and NA genes was determined. The resulting virus was designated as Influenza A virus (A/blow fly/Kagoshima/23a738D/2023, isolate ID: EPI_ISL_18969146).Sequence data of HPAI virus in cranes (2023–2024 winter season, Kagoshima) were obtained from GISAID (EPI_ISL_18770565, EPI_ISL_18909437, EPI_ISL_18770564, EPI_ISL_18770563, EPI_ISL_18770562, and EPI_ISL_18651568) and used for sequence alignment and comparison.

On March 27, 2023, the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China reported a confirmed human case of infection with avian influenza A(H3N8) virus “H3N8 bird flu.” This H3N8 virus infection is not thought to pose a risk to the health of the U.S. public. CDC Update April 14, 2023 – The National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China reported a confirmed case of human infection with avian influenza A(H3N8) virus "H3N8 bird flu" on March 27, 2023. The patient was an adult with multiple underlying medical conditions from Guangdong Province who became ill on February 22, 2023, was hospitalized with severe pneumonia on March 3, 2023 and later died on March 16, 2023. This is the third human infection with H3N8 bird flu virus and first fatality ever reported. The previous two human infections with H3N8 virus were also reported in China, during 2022. H3N8 viruses are a different influenza A virus subtype and unrelated to H5N1 viruses currently spreading among wild birds and poultry in the United States and globally. Based on what is currently known, this human case of H3N8 virus infection is not thought to pose a risk to the health of the U.S. public at this time. Background: H3N8 viruses were first detected in wild birds in the 1960s and have been detected in other animals. H3N8 viruses have been sporadically detected in poultry in China and some have been found to be genetically closely related to the human cases reported in 20221. Sporadic human infections with bird flu viruses have occurred with different bird flu virus subtypes. Over the past two decades, H7N9 viruses have caused the highest number of human infections with bird flu viruses, and H5N1 viruses have caused the second highest number of human infections. Most human infections with avian influenza A viruses have resulted from direct contact with, or close exposure to, infected birds/poultry. Information on Human Infections with Avian Influenza A(H3N8) Virus: According to a statement from the Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the third human infection with H3N8 virus occurred in an adult in China who reportedly had a history of exposure to live poultry and wild birds (which had been observed around the home). An investigation did not find any additional human infections. According to a report from the World Health Organization, "Environmental samples were collected from the patient's residence and the wet market where the patient spent time before the onset of illness. The results of testing showed that the samples collected from the wet market were positive for influenza A(H3)"2. Officials in China believe the risk of the virus spreading further at this point is low [1]. Both of the human infections with H3N8 viruses reported in 2022 were in children. The first infection was in a child who had exposure to backyard chickens and wild ducks in April 20225. The patient became critically ill and was hospitalized for their illness. The second infection occurred in May 2022 in a child who visited a wet market where live poultry were present6. That child had mild symptoms3. All close contacts of the first two reported cases tested negative for influenza A viruses, and both children recovered. United States Situation: H3N8 bird flu has never been detected in the United States in people; however, H3N8 viruses of a different genetic lineage have been detected in U.S. wild birds and some mammals in the past. In 2011, there was an outbreak of H3N8 viruses among harbor seals in New England that caused deaths in 162 seals. In the United States, current bird flu preparedness and surveillance activities are largely focused on H5N1 bird flu, which is widespread in U.S. wild birds and has caused extensive outbreaks in U.S. poultry, with sporadic spillover to some mammals. The current risk to the U.S. general public from H5N1 bird flu viruses remains low at this time; however, it is important to remember that risk depends on exposure, and people with more exposure might have a greater risk of infection. CDC has guidance for specific groups of people with exposure to poultry, including poultry workers and people responding to outbreaks of avian influenza A(H5N1) in poultry. Additional information on protective actions around birds, including what to do if you find a dead bird, is available as well. Currently, CDC does not recommend against travel to any countries due to bird flu viruses. CDC recommends that travelers to countries and states with bird flu outbreaks in poultry or people: Do not visit poultry farms, bird markets, or other places where live poultry are raised, kept, or sold, if possible. Do not eat raw or undercooked poultry products and wash your hands after touching uncooked poultry. Practice good hygiene and cleanliness. Visit a health care provider if you become sick during or after travel. CDC is following global developments related to avian influenza closely and will continue to provide further updates to the situation and update guidance as needed. This spotlight was first posted on April 10 and subsequently updated on April 14 to include additional information from two WHO reports, including the fact that the patient died from their illness and had multiple underlying conditions that would have placed them at higher risk of developing serious complications from influenza A virus infections.

In this Review, we discuss our current understanding of the optimal immune responses that drive recovery from influenza virus infection, highlighting the fine balance between protective immune mechanisms and detrimental immunopathology. We describe the contribution of innate and adaptive immune cells, inflammatory modulators and antibodies to influenza virus-specific immunity, inflammation and immunopathology. We highlight recent human influenza virus challenge studies that advance our understanding of susceptibility to influenza and determinants of symptomatic disease. We also describe studies of influenza virus-specific immunity in high-risk groups following infection and vaccination that inform the design of future vaccines to promote optimal antiviral immunity, particularly in vulnerable populations. Finally, we draw on lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic to refocus our attention to the ever-changing, highly mutable influenza A virus, predicted to cause future global pandemics.

May 3, 2024 EspaÃ±ol What Causes Bird Flu Virus Infections in Humans What to know Although avian (bird) influenza (flu) A viruses usually do not infect people, there have been some rare cases of human infection with these viruses. About avian influenza (bird flu) Although avian (bird) influenza (flu) A viruses usually do not infect people, there have been some rare cases of human infection with these viruses. Illness in humans from avian influenza virus infections have ranged in severity from no symptoms or mild illness to severe disease that resulted in death. Avian influenza A(H7N9) virus and highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) and A(H5N6) viruses have been responsible for most human illness from avian influenza viruses reported worldwide to date, including the most serious illnesses with high mortality. Infected birds shed avian influenza viruses through their saliva, mucous and feces. Other animals infected with avian influenza viruses may have virus present in respiratory secretions, different organs, blood, or in other body fluids, including animal milk. Human infections with avian influenza viruses can happen when virus gets into a person's eyes, nose or mouth, or is inhaled. This can happen when virus is in the air (in droplets, small aerosol particles, or possibly dust) and deposits on the mucus membranes of the eyes or a person breathes it in, or possibly when a person touches something contaminated by viruses and then touches their mouth, eyes or nose. Avian influenza viruses have been detected in many other species. Avoid contact with surfaces that appear to be contaminated with animal feces, raw milk, litter, or materials contaminated by birds or other animals with suspected or confirmed avian influenza virus infection. CDC has information about precautions to take with wild birds, poultry and other animals. CDC has guidance for specific groups of people with exposure to poultry and other potentially infected animals, including poultry or dairy workers, for example, and people responding to bird flu outbreaks. Additional information is available at Information for People Exposed to Birds Infected with Avian Influenza Viruses of Public Health Concern. In late March 2024, a human case of influenza A(H5N1) virus infection was identified after exposure to dairy cattle presumably infected with bird flu. Some bird flu infections of people have been identified in which the source of infection was unknown. The spread of bird flu viruses from one infected person to a close contact is very rare, and when it has happened, it has only spread to a few people. However, because of the possibility that bird flu viruses could change and gain the ability to spread easily between people, monitoring for human infection and person-to-person spread is extremely important for public health. Signs and symptoms The reported signs and symptoms of bird flu virus infections in humans have ranged from no symptoms or mild to severe. Signs and symptoms may include: eye redness (conjunctivitis) mild flu-like upper respiratory symptoms pneumonia requiring hospitalization fever (temperature of 100ºF [37.8ºC] or greater) or feeling feverish*, cough sore throat runny or stuff nose muscle or body aches headaches fatigue shortness of breath or difficulty breathing. Less common signs and symptoms include diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, or seizures. *Fever may not always be present View LargerDownload This graphic shows how bird flu viruses can spread between infected birds and people.

Sept. 17, 2024 Download Download Detecting avian influenza A virus infection in humans Bird flu virus infection in people cannot be diagnosed by clinical signs and symptoms alone; laboratory testing is needed. Bird flu virus infection is usually diagnosed by collecting a swab from the upper respiratory tract (nose or throat) of the sick person. Testing is more accurate when the swab is collected during the first few days of illness. For critically ill patients, collection and testing of lower respiratory tract specimens also may lead to diagnosis of bird flu virus infection. However, for some patients who are no longer very sick or who have fully recovered, it may be difficult to detect bird flu virus in a specimen. CDC has posted guidance for clinicians and public health professionals in the United States on appropriate testing, specimen collection, and processing of samples from patients who might be infected with avian influenza A viruses.

Here, we elucidate the pivotal role of CD47 in the airway epithelium during bacterial super-infection. We demonstrated that upon influenza virus infection, CD47 expression was upregulated and localized on the apical surface of ciliated cells within primary human nasal or bronchial epithelial cells. This induced CD47 exposure provided attachment sites for Staphylococcus aureus, thereby compromising the epithelial barrier integrity. Through bacterial adhesion assays and in vitro pull-down assays, we identified fibronectin-binding proteins (FnBP) of S. aureus as a key component that binds to CD47. Furthermore, we found that ciliated cell-specific CD47 deficiency or neutralizing antibody-mediated CD47 inactivation enhanced in vivo survival rates. These findings suggest that interfering with the interaction between airway epithelial CD47 and pathogenic bacterial FnBP holds promise for alleviating the adverse effects of super-infection.

Most deaths were due to secondary bacterial pneumonia caused by common upper respiratory tract bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Similarly, the illness of patients in the intensive care unit, infected with 2009 influenza A (H1N1), was exacerbated by secondary bacterial infections, with high morbidity and mortality rates2,3. The development and extensive use of antibiotics have played a crucial role in reducing the severity of secondary bacterial infections. However, the recent emergence of antibiotic resistance has introduced a significant level of complexity to the treatment of these secondary bacterial infections4. Consequently, there is an urgent need to investigate and uncover the elusive molecular mechanisms responsible for secondary bacterial infections triggered by influenza.Airway epithelial cells establish apical junctional complexes between neighboring cells to serve as a protective barrier against the external environment. Apical junctional complexes consist of apical tight junctions and underlying adherens junctions, which facilitate cell–cell adhesion and maintain barrier integrity. Zonula occludens (ZO, e.g., ZO-1) and catenin (e.g., β-catenin) proteins connect the intracellular domains of tight junctions (e.g., Claudins and Occludin) and adherens junctions (e.g., E-cadherin) with cytoskeletal components, forming “cytosolic plaques”5,6. Tight junctions play a critical role in regulating the passage of ions and solutes through the paracellular space, effectively blocking the translocation of pathogens from the lumen to the interstitium. Consequently, viral infections that disrupt tight junctions can facilitate the translocation of pathogens and receptor exposure7,8,9,10. Thus, preserving the integrity of this barrier is crucial in preventing bacterial infection.Respiratory viral infection increases host susceptibility to bacterial pathogens by i) interfering with antibacterial innate immune responses via interferon (IFN) induction11,12,13,14,15,16,17 and depletion of alveolar macrophages18; or ii) providing binding sites for bacteria, including cellular receptors, such as intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1)19,20,21,22,23, carcinogenic embryonic adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1)20,24, platelet-activating factor receptor (PAF-r)20,24, or extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, such as fibronectin (FN)24,25. Given that PAF-r binds to the phosphorylcholine on S. pneumoniae’s cell wall, it has been proposed as a potential therapeutic target for secondary bacterial infections26,27. However, the use of a PAF-r antagonist did not demonstrate any effect in the secondary bacterial infection model28. As a result, it is essential to explore intervention strategies that specifically focus on disrupting the interaction between bacteria and cell receptors, utilizing antibody-mediated blockade, in treatment approaches.CD47, also known as integrin-associated protein (IAP), is a widely expressed transmembrane glycoprotein. It serves as a “don’t-eat-me” signal by interacting with the inhibitory receptor signal-regulatory protein alpha (SIRPα) on myeloid immune cells, thereby inhibiting phagocytosis of CD47-expressing erythrocyte29. Cancer and viral-infected hematopoietic cells overexpress CD47 for immune evasion30,31. Meanwhile, in non-hematopoietic cells, CD47 plays a role in tissue repair, contributing to improved healing and survival in various models such as skin thermal injury32, organ transplant33,34,35,36,37, and intestinal mucosal injury38. Notably, the specific involvement of CD47 in airway epithelium during super-infection remains unexplored. In a proteomics analysis of nasal epithelial cells infected with influenza virus, we observed the presence of CD47. Through the validation process, we uncovered that CD47 induced by viral infection was not only detected in the colonization site (nasal epithelium) but also at the site of infection (bronchial epithelium). Given that CD47 seems to be predominantly expressed in FoxJ1+ cells (deuterosomal cells and, to a lesser extent, multi-ciliated cells) based on single-cell RNA sequencing and immunostaining analysis of upper and lower airway primary epithelial cells, we initiated an investigation into the involvement of CD47 in secondary bacterial infections using a FoxJ1+ cell-specific CD47 gene-deletion mouse model and CD47 neutralizing antibodies. In our pursuit to identify a bacterial component that interact with CD47, we conducted experiments involving five mutant strains of S. aureus with deleted cell wall-anchored proteins. Remarkably, our investigations revealed that only fibronectin-binding proteins (FnBP) exhibited a strong affinity for CD47. To further solidify our findings, we employed a combination of FoxJ1+ cell-specific CD47 gene-deletion mice and a FnBP mutant strain of S. aureus in the context of super-infection. This approach allowed us to establish that the specific interaction between airway epithelial CD47 and bacterial FnBP plays a pivotal role in causing super-infection. By comprehensively exploring the role of CD47 in facilitating secondary bacterial infections, this study may pave the way for the development of innovative therapeutic approaches, ultimately leading to improved clinical outcomes for patients.ResultsCD47 is upregulated and localized to the apical surface of ciliated cells following infection of HBECs and HNECs with influenza virusLimited research has investigated the localized surface remodeling of primary human nasal epithelial cells (HNECs) in the context of viral infection10,23,24,39. Consequently, the complete spectrum of upregulated adhesion molecules during respiratory viral infections that facilitate bacterial attachment and invasion remains unknown. To address this gap, the present study provides a comprehensive examination of HNEC responses to influenza virus pH1N1 infection. This investigation employs global proteome profiling of uninfected (Mock, n = 4) and influenza-infected (Virus-only, n = 4) HNECs utilizing isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) technique. A total of 3583 proteins were detected, 89 of which were significantly increased (52 proteins) or decreased (37 proteins) in the virus-infected HNECs compared to mock-infected controls (p < 0.05) (Supplementary Fig. 1a, b). Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis revealed four significantly enriched virus-related pathways in the virus-infected HNEC proteome, including “Influenza A” (Supplementary Fig. 1c). At three days post-infection (dpi), viral gene expression was elevated, accompanied by an increase in host innate immune responses, particularly type-I and type-III interferons (IFNs) (Supplementary Fig. 1d), while type-II IFN remained unchanged. Following viral infection, two candidate proteins displayed increased peptide expression and were expected to localize in the cellular membrane: leukocyte surface antigen CD47 (Q08722, FC = 1.15, p = 0.001), and carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 5 (CEACAM5, P06731, FC = 1.14, p = 0.028) (Supplementary Fig. 1b). Among these candidates, CD47 was selected for further investigation, and its expression was validated in both HNECs (Supplementary Fig. 2) and primary human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) (Fig. 1). Subsequent to viral infection, ZO-1 abundance decreased, and its cellular connections were disrupted, while CD47 exhibited increased expression in both HNECs (Supplementary Fig. 2a–c) and HBECs (Fig. 1a–c). In line with a prior study38, functional annotation using gene ontology (GO) analysis demonstrated that CD47’s biological processes were linked to response to stimulus-related GOs, cell migration-related GOs, immune system process-related GOs, cell surface receptor signaling pathway, and cellular component organization (Supplementary Fig. 1e).Fig. 1: Influenza virus induces CD47 expression on the apical surface of ciliated cells in an NF-κB-dependent manner.HBECs were infected with (+ IAV) or without (Mock) influenza A virus. a Immunoblot analysis of junction protein ZO-1 and surface protein CD47 at 1 day post-infection (dpi).

In HBECs, we confirmed the activation of the NF-κB pathway induced by viral infection, evidenced by p65 phosphorylation at 1 h post-infection (hpi), along with the induction of the downstream target protein, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1)19,23. CD47 protein abundance exhibited a slight increase after 1 hpi and reached its peak at 12 hpi (Supplementary Fig. 3a). Pre-treatment of HBECs with caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE), a specific inhibitor of NF-κB, resulted in the inhibition of viral infection-induced p65 phosphorylation at 1 hpi (Supplementary Fig. 3b). Additionally, the upregulation of ICAM-1 and CD47 at 24 hpi was blocked (Fig. 1d), confirming the involvement of the NF-κB pathway in mediating CD47 upregulation in airway epithelial cells during viral infection. We also conducted an extensive investigation to determine whether CD47 induction is dependent on IFN, the production of which is NF-κB-dependent41. We observed an increase in CD47 expression following viral infection (Supplementary Fig. 3c, d), and this effect was replicated in HBECs treated with recombinant human IFN-β (Supplementary Fig. 3e) and IFN-λ1 (Supplementary Fig. 3f). Notably, the induction of CD47 by influenza virus was entirely suppressed when anti-IFNAR (Supplementary Fig. 3c) or anti-IFNLR (Supplementary Fig. 3d) neutralizing antibodies were applied. Additionally, the induction of CD47 by recombinant human IFN-β was effectively inhibited by anti-IFNAR neutralizing antibodies (Supplementary Fig. 3e), while CD47 induction by recombinant human IFN-λ1 was specifically blocked by anti-IFNLR neutralizing antibodies (Supplementary Fig. 3f). These results collectively demonstrate that CD47 induction occurs via the NF-κB/IFN pathway.To ascertain if viral infection-induced CD47 expression is specific to certain cell types, we conducted co-immunostaining of airway epithelial cells and observed that CD47+ HNECs (Supplementary Fig. 2d) and CD47+ HBECs (Fig. 1e) were co-localized with the ciliated cell-specific marker, Ac-α-tubulin (92.0 ± 1.0% in HNECs; 91.1 ± 0.6% in HBECs) rather than the goblet cell-specific marker, MUC5AC (0.6 ± 0.6% in HNECs; 3.0 ± 1.6% in HBECs), during viral infection. Interestingly, co-immunostaining of CD47 and influenza nucleoprotein (NP) revealed that not all CD47-positive cells completely overlapped with viral protein (Supplementary Fig. 3g). It’s worth noting that ciliated cells are a part of the epithelium, lining the apical surface of the respiratory tract and exposing their cilia to the lumen42. Therefore, the detection of CD47 co-expressed with Ac-α-tubulin indicates that it is present on the apical side of the ciliated cells. In a similar context, the analysis of HNEC single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data revealed that CD47+ clusters primarily consist of FOXJ1+ cells, with a notable prevalence of deuterosomal cells and a partial presence of multi-ciliated cells (Supplementary Fig. 2e)43. These results reinforce a fundamental aspect of this study, underscoring the specific presence of CD47 expression in ciliated epithelial cells. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis further confirmed the presence of CD47 protein on the cell surface of HNECs, with increased expression observed during viral infection (Supplementary Fig. 2f). Therefore, these findings demonstrate that CD47 is induced and exposed on the apical surface of ciliated cells in respiratory epithelial cells infected with the influenza virus.Epithelial CD47 in HBECs and HNECs facilitates super-infectionTo elucidate the mechanisms underlying susceptibility to secondary bacterial infection induced by viral infection, we developed an in vitro model of super-infection using HNECs and HBECs (Supplementary Fig. 4). HNECs simulate the upper airway, the initial site of viral infection, while HBECs represent the lower airway, where super-infection has a terminal impact. Following air–liquid interface (ALI) culture for 14 days (HNECs) or 21 days (HBECs), cells were infected with influenza virus pH1N1 and/or S. aureus. Since ZO-1 displayed reduced levels and disconnection during viral infection, we assessed the impact of secondary bacterial infection on HNECs and HBECs by evaluating paracellular permeability, changes in cellular morphology, and cell viability. When cells were co-infected with virus (MOI 1) and bacteria (MOI 5 for HNECs; MOI 3 for HBECs), paracellular permeability of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran was significantly elevated (Supplementary Fig. 4a, e), and trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) showed a substantial decrease (Supplementary Fig. 4b, f), as compared to mock-infected HNECs and HBECs. Notably, both of these parameters remained unchanged in cells subjected to either virus or bacteria single infection. Although no significant detrimental effect of super-infection was observed in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay at 3 dpi (Supplementary Fig. 4c, g), visible cytopathogenic effects resulting from super-infection became apparent after 7 days in HNECs and 5 days in HBECs (Supplementary Fig. 4d, h). Given that HNECs exhibited greater resistance to super-infection compared to HBECs44, it necessitated a longer incubation period with bacteria to observe a similar super-infection effect in HBECs. To investigate the function of CD47 in super-infection, we reduced CD47 expression by transfecting airway epithelial cells with lentiviral shRNA targeting the CD47 gene. This resulted in a decrease in CD47 transcript levels to 56.1 ± 4.4% in HNECs (Supplementary Fig. 5a) and 58.6 ± 3.6% in HBECs (Fig. 2a), accompanied by a corresponding reduction in CD47 protein levels, 41.7 ± 5.2% in HNECs (Supplementary Fig. 5b) and 54.2 ± 6.3% in HBECs (Fig. 2b). Subsequently, we assessed the impact of CD47 knockdown on the response to super-infection by measuring paracellular FITC-dextran permeability and TEER at 3 dpi, which revealed a substantial attenuation of these effects in both HNECs (Supplementary Fig. 5c, d) and HBECs (Fig. 2c, d) following CD47 shRNA treatment. Furthermore, we inhibited CD47 protein function by pre-incubating cells with α-hCD47 neutralizing antibodies before super-infection. This intervention resulted in significant mitigation of disruption in paracellular permeability and TEER at 3 dpi in HNECs (Supplementary Fig. 5e, f) and HBECs (Fig. 2c, d), as well as a reduction in the cytopathogenic effects of super-infection in HNECs at 7 dpi (Supplementary Fig. 5g) and HBECs at 5 dpi (Fig. 2e). In a super-infection model with S. pneumoniae, the treatment of CD47 shRNA and α-hCD47 antibodies exhibited comparable protective effects on paracellular permeability and TEER in HBECs (Supplementary Fig. 6a, b). These results suggest that viral infection-induced epithelial CD47 may be exploited by pathogenic bacteria to induce super-infection by disrupting cellular junction integrity.Fig. 2: Knock-down or neutralization of CD47 protects HBECs from viral–bacterial co-infection.For CD47 knock-down, HBECs were transfected with scrambled shRNA (sc-shRNA) or shRNA targeting CD47 (CD47 shRNA) using a lentiviral delivery system. For CD47 neutralization, HBECs were treated with either IgG1 (MOPC-21) or α-hCD47 (B6H12.2) antibodies. a Gene expression of CD47 was analyzed using qRT-PCR (normalized by GAPDH mRNA) (sc-shRNA, n = 4; CD47 shRNA, n = 4). b Protein expression of CD47 was analyzed using immunoblotting (sc-shRNA, n = 5; CD47 shRNA, n = 5). c Paracellular FITC-dextran permeability was measured in Mock (n = 16), Virus only (IAV, n = 16), Bacteria only (S. aureus, n = 16), sc-shRNA + Super-infection (n = 12), CD47 shRNA + Super-infection (n = 6), IgG1 + Super-infection (n = 6), and α-hCD47 antibodies (Ab) + Super-infection (n = 8). d Trans-epithelial resistance was measured in Mock (n = 15), IAV (n = 14), S. aureus (n = 13), sc-shRNA + Super-infection (n = 13), CD47 shRNA + Super-infection (n = 6), IgG1 + Super-infection (n = 6), and α-hCD47 Ab + Super-infection (n = 8). e Microscopic images of HBECs at 5 dpi.

A whole-mount image of viral-infected HBECs briefly exposed to S. aureus (for 3 h, as longer exposure led to cell layer destruction) revealed the co-localization of bacteria with CD47 on the cell surface where ZO-1 disruption occurred (Fig. 3c). This observation led to our hypothesis that live S. aureus directly interacts with host CD47 to cause super-infection. To validate this hypothesis, we initially conducted a bacterial adhesion assay to quantify the number of bacteria adhering to HBECs after a 3-hour co-incubation. This analysis revealed a significant increase in the adherence of S. aureus to the cells following viral infection in HBECs (Fig. 3d). Additionally, the virus-induced bacterial adherence was inhibited when the cells were pre-incubated with α-hCD47 antibodies (Fig. 3d), suggesting that this cell-to-bacteria interaction may be dependent on CD47.Fig. 3: Epithelial CD47 and bacterial FnBP directly interacts.a, b Influenza virus-infected HBECs (IAV) infected with live S. aureus or S. aureus-derived samples (S, supernatant of S. aureus-cultured media; U, UV-killed S. aureus; H, heat-killed S. aureus).

Colonization of S. aureus WT (FnBP A+/B+) (f) and double deletion mutant (FnBP A–/B–) (g) was assessed in HBECs inoculated with the virus (MOI 1) for 2 h before treatment with IgG1 control antibodies (n = 4) or α-hCD47 neutralizing antibodies (1, 5, and 10 μg/mL for FnBP A+/B+, and 10 μg/mL for FnBP A–/B–, n = 4 each) for 2 h, followed by S. aureus (MOI 3) infection for 3 h. h Pull-down assay using His-tagged hCD47 recombinant protein.

This was assessed by testing the adhesion of S. aureus, S. pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa on A549 cells, with the commensal bacterium, Staphylococcus epidermidis serving as a negative control. The results showed that adherence of pneumonia-causing gram-positive bacteria S. aureus and S. pneumoniae to cellular CD47 was significantly inhibited following pre-incubation of the cells with α-hCD47 antibodies. However, adherence of pneumonia-causing gram-negative bacterium P. aeruginosa, was not affected by α-hCD47 antibodies. Moreover, the gram-positive commensal bacterium, S. epidermidis, did not bind to the cells (Supplementary Fig. 7b). Since only S. aureus and S. pneumoniae showed CD47-specific binding, we hypothesized that these two pathogens might share CD47-interacting components. Literature indicated that during infection, S. aureus and S. pneumoniae utilize structurally homologous adhesion molecules, such as Fn-binding protein (FnBP), to interact with integrin α5β1 by using Fn as a bridge. Specifically, FnBP A or B of S. aureus and pneumococcal adherence and virulence factor A (PavA) of S. pneumoniae are involved in these interactions4,45,46.To test whether FnBPs are required for S. aureus binding to CD47, we employed S. aureus laboratory strain 8325-4 (FnBP A+/B+) and three mutant strains (FnBP A+/B–, A–/B+, and A–/B–)47. In bacterial adhesion assay, we observed that the single deletion of FnBP A or B reduced S. aureus adherence by 23.7 ± 1.7% or 24.7 ± 2.9%, respectively, while the double deletion of FnBP A and B synergically decreased adherence by 35.9 ± 2.4% (Fig. 3e). In contrast to the FnBP A+/B+ strain, where adherence to the viral infection-induced CD47 was inhibited by α-hCD47 antibodies in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3f), the double deletion mutant strain (FnBP A–/B–) showed less adherence to viral infection-induced CD47, and this adherence was not affected by CD47 blocking (Fig. 3g). These findings indicated that FnBP A+/B+ binds to the surface of HBECs through CD47-specific (26.4 ± 1.9%) or non-specific interaction (73.6 ± 1.0%), whereas FnBP A–/B– only by non-specific interaction (61.8 ± 2.6%), suggesting a partial but direct interaction between CD47 and FnBP. To further support our hypothesis, we established an in vitro pull-down assay in which S. aureus was incubated with recombinant His-tagged hCD47 proteins and then pulled down using α-His-Dynabeads. Our results indicated a substantial increase in the precipitation of S. aureus in the pellets and a decreased presence in the supernatants when recombinant hCD47 was present, compared to the condition in which hCD47 was absent (Supplementary Fig. 7c), confirming that S. aureus directly binds to CD47. Lastly, to validate the direct interaction between CD47 and FnBP, we performed a pull-down assay using FnBP A+/B+ and FnBP A–/B–. Our results demonstrated that significantly less FnBP A–/B– (15.8 ± 6.9%) was precipitated in the pellets, even in the presence of recombinant hCD47, in contrast to FnBP A+/B+ (83.2 ± 5.7%) (Fig. 3h). By conducting in vitro pull-down assay using five mutant strains of S. aureus, in which cell wall-anchored proteins were deleted; fnbB::Tn (ΔfnbB), sasG::Tn (ΔsasG), isdB::Tn (ΔisdB), sdrE::Tn (ΔsdrE), and clfA::Tn (ΔclfA). We confirmed that only FnBP mediates the interaction between S. aureus and CD47 (Supplementary Fig. 7d, e). This observation supports the conclusion that S. aureus directly binds to HBECs through a specific interaction between FnBP and CD47.Foxj1Cre-specific disruption or neutralization of CD47 protects mice from super-infectionConsidering the increased expression of CD47 in the tracheal and lung epithelium (Supplementary Fig. 8a–e) and the decreased expression of ZO-1 in the lung lysates of C57BL/6 WT mice following infection with influenza virus (Supplementary Fig. 8f), we subsequently investigated the pathophysiological role of viral infection-induced CD47. As CD47 is ubiquitously expressed, understanding the contributions of specific CD47-expressing cell types during super-infection is crucial for gaining detailed mechanistic insights. Given that epithelial CD47 was exclusively induced in ciliated cells during viral infection (Supplementary Fig. 2d, Fig. 1e), we generated mice with selective CD47 loss in ciliated cells by creating CD47 floxed mice (CD47f/f), bred to constitutively express Cre under the control of the Foxj1 promoter (Foxj1Cre)48. Cre specificity was validated by crossing with tdTomato reporter mice (Supplementary Fig. 9a), in which Foxj1tdTomato-expressing cells were co-stained with the ciliated cell-specific marker protein Ac-α-tubulin. Immunofluorescence confirmed the specific loss of CD47 in ciliated cells of CD47FoxJ1 mice (Supplementary Fig. 9b). To ensure that CD47 inhibition during viral infection does not enhance innate immunity nor induce quicker virus clearance31, we also generated mice with selective loss of CD47 in myeloid immune cells using LysMCre mice (CD47LysM). Notably, CD47FoxJ1 and CD47LysM mice did not exhibit differences in respiratory function under baseline conditions, compared with CD47f/f mice (Supplementary Fig. 9c).To investigate the necessity of airway epithelial CD47 in the context of viral-bacterial co-infection, we established two in vivo mouse models of super-infection. As depicted in Supplementary Figs. 10a and 10k, we employed two different concentrations of virus and bacteria in both the CD47 gene deletion experiment (100 PFU of virus and 1 ×108 CFU of bacteria) and the CD47 neutralizing experiment (10 PFU of virus and 5 ×105 CFU of bacteria). Four groups of mice, including an uninfected group (Mock), a viral infection group, a bacterial infection group, and a super-infection group, were daily monitored for alterations in body weight and mortality over a 29-day period (Supplementary Fig. 10b, c, l, m). Remarkably, approximately 98% of the mice succumbed to the super-infection within 10 days, experiencing unrecoverable weight loss. To understand the underlying causes of this lethality, we assessed i) histological damage scores of lung sections, ii) total cell numbers in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALF), iii) bacterial burden in the lung and the spleen, vi) concentrations of total protein, and v) levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6) in BAL fluids at 24 h following bacterial infection. In all these parameters, the super-infection group exhibited significantly increased values compared to the mock, viral infection, and bacterial infection groups (Supplementary Fig. 10e–j).Subsequently, we investigated whether the presence of airway epithelial CD47 or myeloid CD47 is essential for super-infection. We conducted experiments using 6–8-weeks-old mice weighing between 18–21 grams with specific genetic modifications: FoxJ1-Cre;floxed (Cd47Foxj1), LysM-Cre;floxed (Cd47LysM), and control floxed (Cd47f/f) mice. These mice were infected with 100 PFU of influenza virus on day 0, followed by an infection of 1 ×108 CFU of S. aureus on day 7. Body weight loss and survival rates were monitored for 29 days. Notably, CD47FoxJ1 mice exhibited a recovery in body weight loss and improved survival rates compared to CD47f/f mice (Fig. 4a, b), while CD47LysM mice did not show the same improvements (Fig. 4k, l). Moreover, signs of pneumonia were significantly alleviated in CD47FoxJ1 mice (Fig. 4d–j) but not in CD47LysM mice (Fig. 4n–t) when compared to CD47f/f mice. This improvement was evident through several measures: i) a reduced histological lung injury score (Fig. 4c), ii) decreased total cell numbers in BALF (Fig. 4d), iii) diminished bacterial adherence and invasion in the lung (Fig. 4e, f, respectively) and bacterial burden in the spleen (Fig. 4g), iv) reduced total protein levels (Fig. 4h), and v) decreased levels of TNF-α and IL-6 in BALF 24 h after bacterial infection (Fig. 4i, j, respectively). These findings underscore the protective effect of inhibiting CD47 specifically in ciliated cells rather than myeloid cells against super-infection.Fig. 4: Foxj1Cre-Specific, but not LysMCre-Specific, CD47 disruption protects mice from super-infection.6–8-weeks-old (18–21 g of body weight) FoxJ1-Cre;floxed (CD47Foxj1), LysM-Cre;floxed (CD47LysM), and control floxed (CD47f/f) mice were infected with 100 PFU of influenza virus on day 0, and 1 ×108 CFU of S. aureus on day 7. a, b, k, l Body weight loss (a, k) and survival rates (b, l) were monitored for 29 days.

C57BL/6 WT mice pre-treated with α-mCD47 neutralizing antibodies exhibited a recovery in body weight loss (Fig. 5a) and improved survival rates (Fig. 5b) compared to C57BL/6 WT mice pre-treated with IgG2a control antibodies. Additionally, signs of pneumonia were significantly mitigated in α-mCD47-treated mice compared to IgG2a-treated mice, as evidenced by a decrease in histological lung injury score (Fig. 5c), a reduction in total cell number in BALF (Fig. 5d), a decrease in bacterial adherence and invasion in the lung (Fig. 5e, f, respectively) and bacterial burden in the spleen (Fig. 5g), a decline in total protein levels (Fig. 5h), and a decrease in TNF-α and IL-6 in BALF (Fig. 5i, j). These findings indicate that therapeutically inhibiting CD47 protects mice from super-infection.Fig. 5: CD47 neutralization enhances protection against super-infection.For neutralization test, 6–8-weeks-old (18–21 g of body weight) C57BL/6 WT mice were infected with 10 PFU of influenza virus on day 0 and 5 × 105 CFU of S. aureus on day 7. Before bacterial infection, mice were intranasally treated twice at day 5 and 7 with IgG2a control antibodies (2A3, n = 17) or α-mCD47 neutralizing antibodies (MIAP301, n = 16). a, b Body weight loss (a) and survival rates (b) were monitored for 29 days.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageTo fully confirm the interaction between FnBP and CD47 in vivo, we infected both CD47f/f and CD47FoxJ1 mice with two S. aureus strains, FnBP A+/B+ and FnBP A–/B–, to verify whether the observed phenotype aligns with our expected model49. As expected, FnBP A–/B– exhibited reduced pathogenicity when infecting CD47f/f mice, similar to the effect of FnBP A+/B+ in CD47FoxJ1 mice, while there was no observable effect when either FnBP A+/B+ or FnBP A–/B– infected CD47FoxJ1 mice (Fig. 6a–j). Taken together, our results demonstrate that both airway epithelial CD47 and S. aureus FnBP are essential for the development of super-infection (Fig. 6k).Fig. 6: Interaction between epithelial CD47 and bacterial FnBP is essential to cause super-infection.a–j 6–8-weeks-old (18–21 g of body weight) FoxJ1-Cre; floxed (Cd47Foxj1) and control floxed (Cd47f/f) mice were infected with 100 PFU of influenza virus on day 0, and 1 ×108 CFU of S. aureus WT (FnBP A+/B+) and double deletion mutant (FnBP A–/B–) on day 7 (Cd47f/f + FnBP A+/B+, n = 9; Cd47f/f + FnBP A–/B–, n = 11; Cd47Foxj1 + FnBP A+/B+, n = 12; Cd47Foxj1 +FnBP A–/B–, n = 10).

Data are presented as mean values ± SEM. Significance was determined by one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageDiscussionThe upregulation of CD47 in response to viral infections other than influenza has been documented in previous studies50,51,52. For instance, human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human parainfluenza virus 3 (HPIV3) infections have been shown to increase CD47 levels50. Additionally, CD47 expression is elevated in cells infected with SARS-CoV-252. McLaughlin et al. conducted an analysis of publicly available proteomics53 and transcriptomics54 data, revealing increased CD47 expression in SARS-CoV-2-infected HBECs and Caco2 cells. However, the specific role of viral infection-induced CD47 in the context of secondary bacterial infection remains unclear. In this study, we provide evidence that: i) Influenza virus infection induces the upregulation of airway epithelial CD47, particularly in ciliated cells, accompanied by ZO-1 disruption. ii) FnBP, a member of the microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules (MSCRAMM) family, plays a crucial role in the attachment of pneumonia-causing pathogenic bacteria such as S. aureus. iii) CD47 neutralizing antibodies protect mice from secondary bacterial infection by blocking the direct interaction between CD47 and FnBP. These findings elucidate the intricate interplay between viral infections and bacterial pathogens, particularly regarding CD47 upregulation and its implications for host defenses.The upper and lower airways are lined by a pseudostratified epithelium composed of ciliated, goblet, and basal cells42. In human tissues, influenza viruses primarily bind to ciliated cells, whereas in differentiated airway epithelial cell cultures, they infect non-ciliated cells and, to a lesser extent, ciliated cells55. Recent studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 also exhibit a preference for targeting ciliated cells and interferes with mucociliary clearance56. It’s important to note that while CD47 induction by viral infection is specific to ciliated cells (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Fig. 2d), not all ciliated cells were infected (Supplementary Fig. 3g). Given that virus-induced IFNs are secreted and signal on neighboring cells57, the observed expression pattern can be explained. Although it could be speculated that virus-infected cells experience a more suppressed IFN response due to viral mechanisms inhibiting IFN signals, whereas uninfected cells exhibit a full response to IFN, resulting in the upregulation of CD47, the precise mechanism by which neighboring infected cells induce CD47 in ciliated cells remains unclear at this stage.Pathogenic bacteria possess a multitude of virulence factors that enable them to bind to host receptors or extracellular matrix (ECM) components4,45,46. While our in-depth investigation primarily focused on the membrane proteins of S. aureus as a microbial component responsible for interacting with epithelial CD47, additional research is necessary to uncover the specific surface proteins binding to CD47 in other pneumonia-causing pathogenic bacteria, such as S. pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus hemolyticus. The FnBP-Fn-α5β1 integrin pathway is recognized as the primary adhesion and internalization process; however, it is important to note that additional factors have been shown to influence the efficiency of this process. For example, Dziewanowska et al. reported that the direct interaction between FnBPs and Hsp60 maximizes the internalization efficiency in epithelial cells58. Further investigation is required to determine whether CD47 acts as a co-receptor, enhancing the binding of FnBP-Fn to α5β1 integrin.We assessed CD47 mRNA levels (Supplementary Fig. 8b) and protein levels (Supplementary Fig. 8c, d) at multiple time points, including 2, 3, 5, 7, and 10 dpi. Notably, both mRNA and protein levels exhibited a gradual increase, reaching their peak at 5 dpi, followed by a subsequent decrease. Intriguingly, in contrast to this observation, S. aureus single infection failed to induce CD47 expression in both in vitro and in vivo settings. Furthermore, no synergistic effect was observed with viral infection, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 8g, h. This time course data provides valuable insights into how CD47 expression correlates with the window of enhanced susceptibility to secondary infection, which is typically observed between days 5–10 post-infection with influenza virus59,60. Two potential explanations may account for the expression of CD47 on the surface of host epithelial cells in response to viral infection. In the context of viral propagation, viruses may employ CD47 surface expression as a strategy to evade immune cells presenting “don’t-eat-me” signals, similar to their actions in infected hematopoietic cells30,31. Second, in order to support their systemic proliferation, viruses could induce epithelial cells to express binding sites for bacteria. In the context of host signaling, it is conceivable that virus-infected epithelial cells might stimulate CD47 expression via the NF-κB signaling pathway, as has been reported for ICAM-119,23.Due to the methodological challenges inherent in our primary epithelial cell ALI culture setup, we were unable to distinctly differentiate between bacterial adherence and invasion in vitro. Instead, we utilized a super-infection mouse model to evaluate both the adherence of S. aureus and its invasion into the lung tissue61, as well as bacterial CFU in the spleen as an indicator of systemic bacterial dissemination62. In order to establish an in vivo correlation with the observed loss of the epithelial barrier function in our in vitro super-infection model (Supplementary Fig. 5 and Fig. 2), we validated the downregulation of ZO-1 in the lung following viral infection (Supplementary Fig. 8f) and the increases in S. aureus invasion in the lung (Supplementary Fig. 10g and Fig. 5f) and bacteremia during super-infection (Supplementary Fig. 10h and Fig. 5g).Our findings demonstrated that the absence of CD47 in ciliated cells (Fig. 4f, g) or the absence of FnBP in S. aureus (Fig. 6f, g) indeed provided protection against S. aureus invasion. Notably, this protective effect was not observed in myeloid cell-specific knockout mice (Fig. 4p, q). Additionally, the use of anti-CD47 neutralizing antibody treatment proved effective in preventing the bacterial invasion (Fig. 5f, g). Nonetheless, we have not yet elucidate the precise mechanisms by which accumulated bacteria breach the barrier more effectively. Further investigation into how S. aureus interacts with CD47 to facilitate its invasion process remains a valuable and ongoing area of research.We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of innate immunity and continuously monitored viral loads in the lungs of IAV-infected mice up to 10 dpi. Our observations revealed that there were no significant differences in viral titers between CD47f/f, CD47Foxj1, and CD47LysM mice at 2, 3, 4, and 7 dpi (Supplementary Fig. 9j, k), as well as in IFN-λ2/3 levels (Supplementary Fig. 9g) and viral loads (Supplementary Fig. 9h, i) between CD47f/f mice and CD47Foxj1 mice at 10 dpi. These findings suggest that, at the time points examined, CD47 deficiency in ciliated cells or myeloid cells does not seem to have a substantial impact on innate immunity. A previous study has highlighted the crucial role of CD47 as an “eat me” signal critical for macrophage clearance of neutrophils that have ingested S. aureus, leading to increased infection in the absence of CD4763. While prior research has focused on CD47’s involvement in immune cell communication during bacterial infection, our findings emphasize a distinct aspect where CD47 expressed in epithelial cells during viral infection serves as an attachment site for secondary bacterial infection. Hence, it is conceivable that the roles of CD47 on epithelial cells versus myeloid cells are distinct, necessitating further investigation to fully understand these differences.In summary, we have established that influenza virus triggers the expression of CD47 on the surface of ciliated cells in an NF-κB-dependent manner, creating an environment that promotes the attachment and proliferation of opportunistic pathogens. Furthermore, our research has shown that inhibiting the upregulated airway epithelial CD47 during viral infection can mitigate the detrimental consequences of subsequent bacterial infection. These findings offer fresh perspectives on the susceptibility of virus-infected individuals to secondary bacterial infections and propose CD47 as an innovative and promising therapeutic target for super-infection.MethodsEthics statementAll experiments using human nasal epithelial cells (HNECs) were approved by the institutional review board of Yonsei University College of Medicine (4-2016-1153 and 4-2021-0573), and all participants provided informed consent. All animal work was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Yonsei University College of Medicine (protocol number 2022-0257), according to guidelines outlined by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC) International (facility number 001071).Cell cultureHNECs were cultured as previously described64, while human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) were cultured according to the manufacturer’s instructions (CC-2540S; Lonza). HBECs used in this study were obtained from four non-asthmatic adult donors: a 43-year-old male (Hispanic), a 52-year-old male (Hispanic), a 66-year-old male (Hispanic), and a 48-year-old female (Caucasian). Briefly, the cells were seeded and expanded in T-75 flasks using bronchial epithelial growth media (BEGM, CC-3170; Lonza) containing the recommended supplements BEGM™ SingleQuots™ Kit (CC4175; Lonza) at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. After 80% confluence was reached, the cells were detached using ReagentPack™ (CC-5034; Lonza) and seeded at a density of 5 × 104 cells on rat tail collagen (354236; BD Biosciences)-coated Transwell inserts (6.5 mm, 0.4 μm pore; 3470; Corning). The cells were cultured using BEGM in both apical and basolateral compartments until the cells became confluent (approximately 3 days). Once confluent, the cells were placed under air–liquid interface (ALI) culture conditions; the apical compartments were exposed to air, and the basolateral compartments were supported by bronchial ALI (B-ALI) differentiation media containing the recommended supplements BEGM™ SingleQuots™ Kit. The B-ALI differentiation media were changed on alternative days for 21 days. Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (CCL-34, ATCC). MDCK cells were incubated in 37 °C and 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator using Eagle’s minimum essential medium (30-2003; ATCC) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (16000-044; Thermo Scientific) and 1% penicillin–streptomycin (15140-122; Thermo Scientific). The passage number for all MDCK cells used in this study was less than 50. A549 cells were obtained from ATCC (CCL-185) and grown at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator using Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) (BE12-604F; Lonza) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin–streptomycin. For all influenza virus infections, the medium used in this study was DMEM supplemented with 5% FBS and 1% penicillin–streptomycin. For superinfection, DMEM supplemented with 5% FBS without antibiotics was used. In the NF-κB pathway inhibition experiment, HBECs were treated with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or 10 μM of caffeic acid phenethyl ester (c8221, Sigma Aldrich) for 1 h before viral infection.Virus and bacteriaInfluenza A virus /Korea/01/2009 (pH1N1) used in this study was propagated in embryonated chicken eggs65. Viruses were harvested via centrifugation of allantoic fluid or culture medium at 1300 × g for 10 min. They were stored at −80 °C, and viral titers were determined in a plaque assay65. Briefly, MDCK cells in a monolayer were inoculated with serially diluted viral stocks for 1 h. After adsorption for 1 h, the unbound viral particles were removed, and the cells were overlaid with Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) containing 1% agarose and 1 μg/mL of tosyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich). After incubation for 72 h, the cells were stained with 1% crystal violet, and viral titers were determined by counting the plaques. S. aureus (ATCC® 29213™) and S. pneumoniae (NCCP 14774) were cultured on a Bacto™ brain heart infusion (BHI; BD Biosciences) agar plate at 37 °C66. For the culture of GFP-tagged S. aureus strain, 2.5 mg/mL of tetracycline-hydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich) was added. S. aureus laboratory strain 8325-4 (FnBP A+/B+) and three mutant strains (FnBP A+/B–, A–/B+, and A–/B–) were grown as previously described47. P. aeruginosa and S. epidermidis were cultured on Luria-Bertani (LB) agar plates and Tryptic Soy Agar (TSA) plates, respectively, at 37 °C.For in vitro pull-down assay, we utilized five S. aureus mutant strains of cell wall-anchored proteins (CWAs), namely JE2 fnbB::Tn (NE728), JE2 sasG::Tn (NE825), JE2 isdB::Tn (NE1102), JE2 sdrE::Tn (NE98), and JE2 clfA::Tn (NE543), all of which were obtained from the Nebraska Transposon Mutant Library (BEI resources)67. The absence of CWAs in these mutants was validated through PCR using specific primers. The wild-type (WT) control used for this study was the Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strain USA300 JE2. The WT JE2 strain was cultured at 37 °C on TSA plates, while the other mutant strains were cultured at 37 °C on TSA plates supplemented with 10 µg/mL erythromycin.MiceC57BL/6J background CD47 floxed (Cd47f/f) mice were purchased from the Mouse Biology Program at UC Davis, CA, USA (Cd47tm1c(KOMP)Mbp/Mmucd, 046999-UCD). Rosa26-tdTomato reporter mice were kindly provided by Dr. Jinwoong Bok (Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea). Foxj1Cre transgenic and LysMCre knock-in/knock-out mice were kindly provided by Dr. Michael J. Holtzman (Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO) and Dr. Hyoung-Pyo Kim (Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea), respectively. Foxj1Cre;Cd47f/f (Cd47Foxj1), LysMCre;Cd47f/f (Cd47LysM), and Cd47f/f mice were bred in-house at Yonsei University College of Medicine in Seoul, Republic of Korea. Mice were housed in the specific pathogen-free (SPF) animal facilities under a 12 h light-dark cycle at 20 ± 2 °C, a humidity of 50 ± 5%, ventilation of 10–15/h, the light of 150–300 Lux, noise of less than 60 dB and maintained on normal chow diet. The genotypes of mice were determined using PCR amplification of tail DNA using primers listed in Supplementary Table 1.Viral and bacterial super-infection (in vitro model)For in vitro super-infection experiments, fully differentiated HNECs or HBECs were infected with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or influenza virus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) 1 and incubated for 2 h. After viral infection, cells were washed twice with PBS and supplied with fresh media. The following day, the virus-infected cells were infected with PBS or S. aureus at MOI 5 (HNECs) or at MOI 3 (HBECs) or S. pneumoniae at MOI 5 (HBECs), and incubated for 3 h. After bacterial infection, cells were washed twice with PBS and supplied with fresh media supplemented without gentamycin.Viral and bacterial super-infection (in vivo model)Six to seven-week-old mice (18–21 g body weight) were used. Mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection (i.p.) of Zoletil: Rompun: PBS (1:1:8) mixture (100 μL) and infected intranasally with PBS or 100 plaque-forming units (PFUs) of influenza virus (30 μL) at day 0. For the super-infection model, uninfected or virus-infected mice were infected intranasally with PBS or 1 ×108 CFU of S. aureus (20 μL) at day 7. Following viral infection, mice were monitored daily for changes in weight and mortality until day 29. Mice manifesting a weight loss exceeding 30% of their initial body weight were humanely euthanized and subsequently excluded from further analysis in both weight loss and survival data, in accordance with the humane euthanasia criteria defined by the relevant animal protocols. Weight loss (or discovery of mice found dead) was the sole criterion for determining mortality in our study. Clinical scores were not used as an additional parameter for declaring a mouse dead.Proteomic analysisiTRAQ or tandem mass tag (TMT) proteomic methods were used to identify total protein expression differences between uninfected or influenza virus-infected HNECs. Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (Sigma Aldrich) with Halt™ Protease & Phosphatase Inhibitor Single-Use Cocktail, EDTA-free (100x) mixture (78443; Thermo Scientific). Acetone-precipitated protein pellets were stored at −80 °C. Proteins from HNECs or HBECs were labeled using the 8plex iTRAQ labeling kit (4390812; SCIEX) or the TMT 10plex isobaric label reagent set (90111; Thermo Scientific), respectively, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The labeled peptides were pooled and then dried using SpeedVac (Thermo Scientific). Strong cation exchange fractionation, liquid chromatography (LC)-mass spectrometry (MS), database searching, and quantitative data analysis were performed by Poochon Scientific68.Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR)Total RNA was isolated from HNECs, HBECs, and mouse lung tissues using Hybrid-R™ (305-101; GeneAll Biotechnology). cDNA was synthesized via reverse-transcription using 500 ng of RNA with random hexamer primers (N8080127; Invitrogen), RNase inhibitor (N8080119; Applied Biosystems), dNTPs (N8080260; Applied Biosystems), and M-MLV reverse transcriptase (28025013; Invitrogen). For real-time qPCR, KAPA SYBR FAST qPCR master mix (2X) was used according to the manufacturer’s instruction. PCR reaction was performed using QuantStudio 3 Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Scientific). The gene expression levels were evaluated using the comparative Ct method (2−ΔΔCt method). Primers used for real-time qPCR in this study are listed in Supplementary Table 1.Confocal microscopyFor immunofluorescence (IF) staining, cell slides were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 20 min, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 (0694; Amresco, NY, USA) in PBS for 5 min, and treated with 50 mM NH4Cl (A9434; Sigma Aldrich) in PBS for 15 min. After incubation in a blocking solution containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 0.1% Triton X-100, 1% normal donkey serum (NDS) for 1 h at room temperature (RT), the slides were incubated with primary antibodies diluted in Dako antibody diluent (S3022; Dako) at 4 °C overnight and with secondary antibodies in diluted in Dako antibody diluent at RT for 1 h. For mouse trachea IF staining, trachea was fixed in 4% PFA for 24 h. Trachea samples were transferred to 50% OCT compound in PBS for 24 h, sequentially transferred to 100% OCT compound for 24 h, embedded in Tissue-Tek OCT compound (4583; Sakura Finetek), snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. All sections were cut at 8 µm in a cryostat microtome. Cryo-sections on slides were covered with 3% peroxidase blocking solution (S2023; Dako) for 10 min at RT. After the inactivation of endogenous peroxidase, slides were washed twice with 1% TBS. Blocking was conducted using 5% BSA at RT for 1 h. The slides were incubated with primary antibodies (1:100) diluted in Dako antibody diluent at 4 °C overnight. The following day, slides were washed three times with 1% TBS and then incubated with secondary antibodies diluted with Dako antibody diluent at RT for 1 h. After final washing, the slides were cover-slipped with Fluoroshield™ and DAPI (F6057; Sigma Aldrich).

Cells were incubated with 1 µg of mouse IgG isotype control antibody (31903; Invitrogen) or mouse anti-hCD47 APC-conjugated antibody (ab134485; Abcam, 1:200) for 20 min on ice. Cells were analyzed using the BD FACSLyric™ (BD Biosciences). Nonviable cells were excluded from further analyses. Data were acquired with BD FACSuite v1.3 (BD Biosciences) and analyzed with FlowJoTM v10.6.2 software (BD Biosciences).ImmunoblottingPrimary epithelial cells and mouse lung tissues were lysed in RIPA buffer with Halt™ Protease & Phosphatase Inhibitor Single-Use Cocktail, EDTA-free (100x). Equal concentrations of proteins (25 μg) were separated using 8–12% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to PVDF membranes (Merck Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA). After blocking with 5% skim-milk or bovine serum albumin (BSA) in Tris-buffered saline (50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl) containing 0.5% Tween 20 (TTBS) for 1 h at RT, the membranes were incubated with primary antibodies (1:1,000) in 5% skim-milk or BSA with TTBS at 4 °C overnight. The membranes were then washed three times with TTBS and incubated with secondary antibodies diluted (1:1,000) in 5% skim-milk with TTBS for 1 h.

After two PBS washes, the apical compartments of the transwell were treated with 4 kDa FITC-dextran (Sigma Aldrich), and the basolateral compartments of the transwell were replaced with 1 mL of Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS, LB003-02; Welgene). After incubation for 2 h, the HBSS of the basolateral compartments was collected and analyzed using BioTek Cytation™ 5 Cell Imaging Multi-Mode Reader (Agilent).Measurement of transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER)The electric resistance of the respiratory epithelium was determined by measuring TEER in HNECs or HBECs using the EVOM® resistance meter and Endohm® chamber (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL, USA) as described previously69. The values for cell-covered transwell inserts were expressed in standard units of ohms per square centimeter (Ω/cm2) after subtracting the resistance of blank transwell inserts and presented as mean ± standard error of mean (SEM).Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) assayFollowing infection, cell cytotoxicity was measured using CytoTox 96 Non-Radioactive Cytotoxicity Assay kit (G1780; Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, apical and basolateral supernatants of HNECs and HBECs were collected and incubated with the reagent for 30 min in a 96-well plate. Results were obtained at 490 nm using VersaMaxTM Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices). Positive control was supplied with the kit, while PBS or culture medium was used as the negative control. Data was analyzed with SoftMax® Pro Software v5.2 (Molecular Devices).Short hairpin RNA (shRNA) transfectionFor the knock-down of human CD47, a plasmid-based lentiviral shRNA was purchased from Lugen Sci. The sequence for the CD47-specific shRNA was 5’-GCA TGG CCC TCT TCT GAT TTC-3’, and that for scrambled shRNA (sc-shRNA) was 5’-GCA CTA CCA GAG CTA ACT CAG ATA GTA CT-3’. HNECs or HBECs (passage #2) were transfected with lentiviral shRNAs (MOI 10) using polybrene reagent (Lugen Sci). After a 24-h incubation, cells were supplied with fresh media. Once confluent, the cells were placed under ALI culture conditions; the apical compartments were exposed to air, and the medium for basolateral compartments was changed every other day for 14 days (HNECs) or 21 days (HBECs).In vitro pull-down assayHis-tagged human CD47 protein (250 ng) (CD7-H5227; Acro biosystems) and 1 × 102 colony-forming units (CFUs) of bacteria were mixed, and the mixtures were isolated using Dynabeads™ His-Tag Isolation & Pulldown kit (10103D; Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After placing the tube on DynaMag™-2 magnet (12321D; Invitrogen), the beads were washed twice with 1 × binding/wash buffer, and the supernatant was removed. The washed buffers (supernatants) and the final beads (pellets) were plated on a BHI agar plate and TSA plate containing 10 µg/mL erythromycin, separated using 12% SDS-PAGE gel, and blotted with anti-human CD47 antibody (B6H12.2, MA5-11895, Thermo Scientific, 1:500).Bacterial adhesion/invasion assayHBECs and A549 cells were infected with PBS or influenza virus at MOI 1. After incubation for 2 h, cells were washed twice with PBS and supplied with fresh media. The following day, the virus-infected cells were subjected to PBS or infected with S. aureus at MOI 10 (A549) or S. aureus laboratory strain 8325-4 (FnBP A+/B+) and three mutant strains (FnBP A+/B–, A–/B+, and A–/B–) at MOI 3 (HBECs). After incubation for 3 h, cells were washed twice with PBS to remove unbound bacteria and lysed with 0.8 mL of 0.025% Triton X-100. After serial dilutions with PBS, the number of bacteria bound to the cells was quantified61. For CD47 neutralization, virus-infected cells were treated with 5 μg/mL of IgG1 control antibodies (31903; Invitrogen) or 5 μg/mL of α-hCD47 neutralizing antibodies (MA5-11895; Invitrogen) for 2 h, followed by bacteria infection for 3 h. For in vivo bacterial adhesion assay, the infected mice were euthanized, and the lung was collected. The lung tissue was homogenized in PBS and centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min. Following centrifugation, the supernatant was discarded, and the sediments were re-suspended with 0.025% Triton X-100. Subsequently, after serial dilutions with PBS, the number of bacteria bound to the cells was quantified61. For in vivo bacterial invasion assay, the lung tissue was incubated with PBS containing 1% penicillin-streptomycin at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 1 h to remove extracellular and surface-adherent bacteria. After the incubation period, the lung tissue was homogenized and centrifuged, and then the sediments were re-suspended with 0.025% Triton X-100. Following serial dilutions with PBS, the number of bacteria bound to the cells was quantified61.Measurement of airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR)Airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR) was measured as the change in airway function using whole-body plethysmography (Buxco Electronics Ltd., USA) as previously described70. Briefly, mice were placed unrestrained in a chamber connecting a transducer to measure pressure changes inside the chamber. After acclimation, increasing concentrations of methacholine (0, 6.25, 12.5, 25, and 50 mg/mL) were nebulized for 3 min, and enhanced pause (Penh, a dimensionless unit, correlates with pulmonary resistance) was measured for 2 min using FinePoint software (Buxco Electronics Ltd.).Histologic analysisLung tissues were fixed in 4% PFA for 24 h and embedded in paraffin. The mouse lung tissues were sectioned and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) to count inflammatory cells that infiltrated the lungs. Lung injury was scored as previously described71. Briefly, blinded adults were scored using lung sections stained with H&E. The severity of inflammation and pneumonia was evaluated based on the number of perivascular lymphocytic infiltration, peribronchial lymphocytic infiltration, bronchitis, and alveolar hemorrhage using the following scoring system: 0, absence; 1, mild; 2, moderate; and 3, severe.Cell count, protein quantification, and cytokine ELISAAfter whole-body perfusion, the mouse right lung lobe and the spleen were used for quantification of bacterial CFU, and left lobe was used for H&E staining for counting inflammatory cells. BAL fluids were collected from the lungs after washing with ice-cold PBS (1 mL). After centrifugation at 1700 × g for 5 min, the supernatants were collected and stored at −80 °C. The pellets of BAL fluid were resuspended with 1 mL of 2% FBS in PBS and then counted using EVE™ automated cell counter (NanoEnTek). Total protein concentration in mouse BAL fluid was measured using Pierce™ BCA protein assay kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (23225; Thermo Scientific). Levels of IL-6 (DY406) and TNF-α (DY410) in mouse BAL fluid were quantified using DuoSet® ELISA kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The ELISA detection limits for IL-6 and TNF-α were consistently greater than pg/mL. The sample absorbance was measured at 450 nm using a VersaMax™ Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices). Data was analyzed with SoftMax® Pro Software v5.2 (Molecular Devices).In vivo neutralizing assayC57BL/6 mice were purchased from Orientbio. Six to eight-week-old male mice (18–21 g body weight) were used. Mice were anesthetized and infected intranasally with 10 PFU of influenza virus at day 0. On days 5 and 7 after viral infection, mice were injected intranasally with either IgG2a control antibodies (clone 2A3; Cat.BE0089; BioXCell) or anti-mouse CD47 antibodies (clone MIAP301; Cat.BE0270; BioXCell). On day 7, 30 min after the second treatment of antibodies, mice were infected intranasally with 5 × 105 CFU of S. aureus.Interferon stimulation assayFor type I and III interferon (IFN) stimulations, basolateral region of hBECs were treated with recombinant human (rh) IFN-β protein (8499-IF; R&D Systems) using 0.1, 1, 10, 100, 1000 U/mL and recombinant human (rh) IL-29/IFN-λ1 protein (1598-IL; R&D Systems) using 0.1, 1, 10, 100 ng/mL for 24 h, respectively. To validate IFN stimulation, the induction of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) were analyzed by qPCR. To block type I IFN signaling experiment, 2 μg/mL of IFNAR1 (ab10739; abcam, 1:50) and normal goat IgG control antibody (AB-108-C; R&D Systems, 1:500) were treated with basolateral region for 1 h prior to the rhIFN-β protein treatment. Similarly, to block type III IFN signaling experiment, 10 μg/mL of IFNλR1 (PBL assay science; 21885-1, 1:50), mouse IgG isotype control antibody (31903; Invitrogen, 1:500) were treated with basolateral region for 1 h prior to the rhIFN-λ1 protein treatment.Quantification and statistical analysisData are analyzed by GraphPad Prism v10.1.0 software and expressed as mean ± SEM. A Student’s t test was employed for single-variable comparisons, one-way ANOVA was utilized for multiple comparisons, and two-way ANOVA was applied for analyses involving multiple variables. Values of p less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.

CDC routinely develops CVVs for novel avian influenza (bird flu) viruses with pandemic potential as part of pandemic preparedness activities. Background A candidate vaccine virus (CVV) is an influenza (flu) virus that has been prepared by CDC or another public health partner that can be used by vaccine manufacturers to produce a flu vaccine. In addition to preparing CVVs for seasonal flu vaccine production, CDC routinely develops CVVs for novel avian influenza (bird flu) viruses with pandemic potential as part of pandemic preparedness activities. Some novel bird flu viruses with pandemic potential are "highly pathogenic avian influenza" (HPAI) viruses, which means they are deadly to domestic poultry, including chickens. Data collected through global and animal flu surveillance informs the selection of CVVs, and experts choose CVVs against bird flu viruses in nature ("wild type" viruses) that pose a risk to human health. The creation of a CVV for a novel bird flu virus is a multistep process that takes months, from start to finish. Creating a bird flu CVV is usually more complicated than the process for creating a seasonal flu CVV. There are five steps involved in the creation of a bird flu CVV, including the following: Production of the candidate vaccine virus (CVV) ; Quality assessment; Determination of attenuation; Request for USDA Select Agent exclusion; and Distribution of the CVV to vaccine manufacturers and other stakeholders. These steps are described below. Production of the candidate vaccine virus (CVV) Flu vaccines protect against specific flu viruses, so the first step in creating a CVV against a particular bird flu virus is to identify the wild type bird flu virus that is posing or may pose a risk to human health. Two qualities are required of a CVV: First, the CVV must be capable of stimulating a protective immune response against that wild type bird flu virus. Second, the CVV must grow well in eggs. Most flu vaccines today are produced using egg-based technology, which requires that the CVVs be grown in chicken eggs so the CVV needs to grow well in chicken eggs. (For more information about how vaccines are made, see "How Influenza (Flu) Vaccines Are Made.") Highly pathogenic bird flu viruses cause severe illness and death in birds and destroy chicken eggs, and are therefore very difficult to grow in eggs. In addition, HPAI viruses cause severe illness and death in animal models of human disease. Therefore, the wild type virus found in nature cannot be used to make the CVV because they won't grow in eggs and might be dangerous to people. Scientists at CDC use "reverse genetics" to create an attenuated (i.e., weakened or milder) form of the bird flu virus that will not cause severe illness in birds (so as to not pose a threat to agricultural interests) and that also will grow well in chicken eggs (so that vaccine manufacturers can use it to produce vaccine). Using reverse genetics, CDC scientists take two genes from the bird flu virus — the neuraminidase (NA) and a modified form of the hemagglutinin (HA) gene — and they combine those two genes with six genes of a commonly used human flu virus that grows well in chicken eggs. The HA and NA from the bird flu virus are either prepared synthetically or by using the viral RNA of the wild type virus, if it is available. The HA is modified by removing the site that is responsible for making the virus deadly to birds and chicken eggs, called the "polybasic cleavage site." The prepared DNA is introduced into cells (typically "Vero" cells in the laboratory) and allowed to grow for three days. Then it is collected from the cells and injected into eggs to grow virus stocks. The virus stocks undergo testing to determine if a sufficient amount of virus is present in the eggs, and the CVV is analyzed to determine if it is suitable for vaccine development in terms of compliance with regulatory requirements. A CVV must be made according to FDA "good laboratory practice" (GLP) regulations for biologics for human use. GLP is a quality system concerned with the organizational process and the conditions under which vaccine development is planned, performed, monitored, recorded, archived and reported per FDA guidelines. Ideally, the attenuated virus resulting at the end of this process is a virus that is antigenically "like" the wild-type bird flu virus. This virus should stimulate the desired immune response and grow well in chicken eggs. Quality Assessment Once the CVV has been created using reverse genetics and grown in eggs (i.e., rescued), the CVV undergoes a number of tests as part of quality assessment. These steps are listed and described below. Gene Sequence Verification: Flu experts verify that the CVV produced is genetically stable and hasn't undergone any unintended changes or mutations. PCR and full genome sequencing are used to ensure the CVV is as close as possible to the wild type bird flu virus it is intended to protect against. Impurity Testing: Flu experts check to make sure that the CVV does not contain bacteria or fungi. Exclusivity Testing: The CVV is tested to ensure that it only contains the virus intended and is not mixed with other viruses. Trypsin Dependent Plaque Assay Testing: The "trypsin dependent plaque assay" is a laboratory test that ensures that the polybasic cleavage site (i.e., the part of the virus that makes the virus deadly in poultry and chicken eggs) has been removed. Embryo Lethality Testing: This test confirms that the CVV does not kill chicken embryos. This is a required for egg-based vaccine production. Antigenic Characterization: CDC uses the hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) test to antigenically characterize the CVV to ensure that the CVV is antigenically similar to the bird flu virus in nature that the CVV is intended to protect against. Antigenic similarity in this instance means antibodies produced in response to the CVV also will recognize and target the corresponding wild-type bird flu virus. Determination of Attenuation Following quality assurance tests, the CVV goes through a series of animal tests intended to confirm that the resulting virus stock is attenuated (i.e., made milder or weakened). Determination of attenuation requires testing in chickens and ferrets. Specific steps are described below: Pathogenicity Testing in Chickens: Chickens are inoculated with the CVV and observed to make sure they don't get sick or die. This testing verifies that the CVV is not highly pathogenic in domestic poultry. This means the CVV will not harm agricultural interests and can be safely used during egg-based production. Pathogenicity testing in chickens is done by an outside collaborator, such as the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA's) Southeastern Poultry Research Laboratory (SEPRL). The results of this testing are then shared with CDC. Pathogenicity testing in ferrets: Ferrets also are inoculated with the CVV and observed to ensure the CVV does not cause severe illness. Flu viruses infect and cause disease in ferrets in a way that is similar to humans, and so ferrets often are used as a model to infer flu disease and transmission characteristics in people. This is the final step to ensure that the CVV has been properly attenuated and is safe for birds and mammals. Request for CVV Exclusion from the USDA Select Agents List Next, a request is filed with the USDA to get the CVV excluded from the "Select Agent" list. Certain biological agents or toxins that pose a potential severe threat to public health and safety are designated as "Select Agents." (For more information on select agents, see the Federal Select Agent Program website.) Highly pathogenic bird flu viruses are Select Agents, and so a CVV made from one of these viruses is treated as a Select Agent until an exclusion is granted by USDA. This is necessary before the CVV can be given to flu vaccine manufacturers. To obtain USDA Select Agent exclusion, CDC prepares and submits appropriate documentation to USDA, including all of the virus attenuation verification data. USDA then reviews the application and decides whether the CVV can be excluded as a Select Agent. Distribution to Vaccine Manufacturers and Other Stakeholders The final step is to ship the CVV. The CVV is shared with other World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborating Centers, Essential Regulatory Laboratories (ERLs) and vaccine manufacturers.

CD8+ T-cells provide broadly cross-reactive immunity and alleviate disease severity by recognizing conserved epitopes. Despite the IBV burden, only 18 IBV-specific T-cell epitopes restricted by 5 HLAs have been identified currently. A broader array of conserved IBV T-cell epitopes is needed to develop effective cross-reactive T-cell based IBV vaccines. Here we identify 9 highly conserved IBV CD8+ T-cell epitopes restricted to HLA-B*07:02, HLA-B*08:01 and HLA-B*35:01. Memory IBV-specific tetramer+CD8+ T-cells are present within blood and tissues. Frequencies of IBV-specific CD8+ T-cells decline with age, but maintain a central memory phenotype. HLA-B*07:02 and HLA-B*08:01-restricted NP30-38 epitope-specific T-cells have distinct T-cell receptor repertoires. We provide structural basis for the IBV HLA-B*07:02-restricted NS1196-206 (11-mer) and HLA-B*07:02-restricted NP30-38 epitope presentation. Our study increases the number of IBV CD8+ T-cell epitopes, and defines IBV-specific CD8+ T-cells at cellular and molecular levels, across tissues and age.

IBVs, consisting of B/Victoria and B/Yamagata lineages2, typically make up 25% of annual influenza cases worldwide, although in some seasons they can exceed 50% of all influenza cases3,4. The burden of seasonal IBV infections is greatly underappreciated2. Hospitalization rates of seasonal IBVs are second only to seasonal A/H3N2 viruses and higher than that of seasonal A/H1N1 viruses5. In contrast to IAVs, which significantly impact young children (<2 years old) and the elderly (>65 years)6, the burden of IBV infections is especially high among school-aged children (5–13 years) in terms of incidence3,7, hospitalization8,9 and fatal outcomes10,11. During the COVID-19 pandemic, non-pharmacological interventions in response to SARS-CoV-2 significantly reduced transmission of IAV and IBV to negligible levels worldwide12. Most notably, influenza B viruses from the Yamagata lineage have not been detected since early 202012. However, with easing of COVID-19 restrictions, seasonal influenza viruses have re-emerged12, leading to concerns for severe influenza seasons in the near future as a result of reduced population immunity13. This is further aggravated by potential co-infections of influenza and SARS-CoV-214 or large amounts of single infections with either influenza or SARS-CoV-215. As such, public health measures, including vaccinations, remain essential in curbing the re-emerging threats.Current seasonal inactivated influenza vaccines rely on strain-specific antibodies that target the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) proteins on the surface of influenza viruses16,17. However, antigenic drift of HA and NA proteins results in reduced efficacy of these vaccines, requiring near annual updates of the influenza vaccine strains18. In the absence of neutralizing antibodies, cross-protective CD8+ T cells can provide substantial protection against severe influenza disease19,20 by recognizing often highly conserved influenza peptides presented on human leukocyte antigen class I molecules (HLA-I) on the surface of virus-infected cells. As such, new T cell based influenza vaccine approaches aim to fully utilize the potential of cross-protective CD8+ T cells16. Indeed novel mRNA vaccine platforms have successfully induced influenza-specific CD8+ T cell responses in mice and ferrets21,22,23.While IBVs should clearly not be underestimated, the lack of a zoonotic reservoir limits their pandemic potential, which means that they are less well studied in comparison to IAVs. However, the lack of zoonotic reservoirs also means that IBV infections and transmissions can potentially be well controlled with a rationally designed broadly cross-reactive IBV vaccine targeting T cells. As immunity to IBVs is understudied, only 18 IBV CD8+ T cell epitopes restricted by 5 HLAs have been defined to date24,25,26,27,28,29, including 14 IBV epitopes identified by our group, 5 of which are restricted by the highly prevalent HLA-A*02:01 allomorph24,27 and 6 restricted by HLA-A*24:02, prevalent among indigenous and Asian populations26. This is in stark contrast to IAVs, for which >400 CD8+ T cell epitopes have been identified30. The lack of known IBV epitopes not only hampers the development of universal IBV T cell vaccines, but also greatly impairs our ability to study protective versus detrimental IBV-specific immune responses across the human lifespan.An important consideration for designing future CD8+ T cell-based influenza vaccines is maximizing global HLA coverage to ensure broad population coverage. In our study, we utilized immunopeptidomics24,25,26,31 to identify IBV peptides presented by HLA-B*07:02, HLA-B*08:01 and HLA-B*35:01 allomorphs. We identified 9 IBV CD8+ T cell epitopes restricted by prominent HLA-B*07:02 (B7/NP30-38, B7/NP233-244, B7/NS1196-206, B7/HA255-263), HLA-B*08:01 (B8/NP92-99, B8/NP479-487) and HLA-B*35:01 (B35/NS1260-268, B35/HA231-239, B35/PB66-74) alleles. Most T cell epitopes were highly conserved among known influenza B virus strains (>99%). Our study thus increased the overall number of known IBV CD8+ T cell epitopes by 50%, presented by 2 additional prominent HLAs, HLA-B*07:02 and HLA-B*35:01. Additionally, we performed in-depth ex vivo analyses for 6 most prominent IBV-specific CD8+ T cell populations in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) across human tissue compartments and across the human lifespan.ResultsGlobal prevalence of HLA-B*07:02, HLA-B*08:01 and HLA-B*35:01 allomorphsAs only 18 CD8+ T cell epitopes spanning 5 HLAs have been previously described for clinically relevant and understudied IBVs 24,25,26,27,28,29, we sought to identify IBVs derived CD8+ T cell epitopes and presented by highly prevalent HLA-B*07:02, HLA-B*08:01 and HLA-B*35:01 allotypes (source: http://www.allelefrequencies.net/ accessed 3/03/2023). HLA-B*07:02 is found in 5.5% of the global population and is particularly enriched in European and North-East Asian populations (9.1% and 6.0%, respectively) (Fig. 1a). HLA-B*08:01 is present in 4.4% of the global population, with highest prevalence in Europeans (7.5%), followed by Australians (5.7%) and North African populations (5.2%) (Fig. 1a). HLA-B*35:01 is found in 5.9% of the global population, with highest prevalence in North-Americas (9.7%), followed by South and Central American populations (7.3%) and North-East Asian (7.1%) (Fig. 1a).Fig. 1: Global expression of HLA-B*07:02, HLA-B*08:01 and HLA-B*35:01 alleles and characterization of published IBV epitopes.a Allele frequency of HLA-B*07:02, HLA-B*08:01 and HLA-B*35:01 according to geographical location (source: http://www.allelefrequencies.net/ accessed 3/03/2023). b Co-expression of HLA-B alleles. c Co-expression of HLA-A and C alleles with HLA-B*07:02, -B*08:01 and -B*35:01. b, c Analysis was performed using our database of healthy blood donor buffy pack (n = 185 donors). d Published IBV CD8+ T cell epitopes. e Representative FACS plots of IFN-γ and TNF expression, together with the frequency of IFN-γ+TNF+CD8+ T cells following in vitro stimulation with previously identified IBV HLA-B*08:01-restricted peptides (n = 6 donors for NP30-38, n = 3 donors for NP263-271 and n = 4 donors for NP413-422). DMSO background was subtracted. Bars represent median and interquartile range (IQR). Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageIn our cohort of healthy Australians, all three HLA allomorphs of interest were broadly co-expressed with other HLA-A, B and C allomorphs. HLA-B*07:02 and B*08:01 were co-expressed in 14–18% of donors, while all three HLA allomorphs were highly co-expressed with HLA-B*44:02 (HLA-B*07:02, 16.3%; HLA-B*08:01, 12.5%; HLA-B*35:01, 16.0%) (Fig. 1b). Commonly shared co-expression allomorphs were detected for HLA-A and -C, namely HLA-A*01:01, A*02:01, A*03:01, C*07:01 and C*07:02, reflective of their prominent expression in the global population (Fig. 1c).Based on the global frequencies and co-expressions, we concluded that any potential identified epitopes restricted to our three HLA alleles of interest would significantly increase the population coverage when included in potential T cell-based influenza vaccine strategies.CD8+ T cell responses towards known HLA-B*08:01-restricted IBV epitopesThe 18 previously identified IBV CD8+ T cell epitopes are restricted to HLA-A*02:0124,28, HLA-A*03:0129, HLA-A*11:0125, HLA-A*24:0226 or HLA-B*08:0127 (Fig. 1d). To the best of our knowledge, no IBV CD8+ T cell epitopes have been reported for HLA-B*07:02 and HLA-B*35:01, while 3 HLA-B*08:01-restricted IBV epitopes, B8/NP30-38 (RPIIRPATL), B8/NP263-271 (ADRGLLRDI) and B8/NP413-422 (ALKCKGFHV), were identified by incubating peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from one donor with IBV, then screening peptides in a 51Cr cytotoxicity assay27. To understand the immunogenicity of the candidate HLA-B*08:01-restricted CD8+ T cell epitopes27, we probed PBMCs from six healthy HLA-B*08:01-expressing individuals for IBV-specific CD8+ T cell responses using our in vitro peptide expansion approach combined with intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) for IFN-γ/TNF production24,25,26,32 (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Fig. 1). Robust IFN-γ+TNF+ CD8+ T cell responses were observed for PBMCs stimulated with the NP30-38 peptide across all HLA-B*08:01 donors (median of 2.2%), while no responses were detected for NP263-271 and NP413-422 (Fig. 1e), consistent with findings by others20.Overall, there remains a paucity of data on IBV-specific CD8+ T cell epitopes across predominant class I HLAs.Identification of IBV-derived peptides presented by HLA-B*07:02, -B*08:01 or -B*35:01To identify IBV peptides presented by HLA-B*07:02, HLA-B*08:01 or HLA-B*35:01, we used our well-established immunopeptidomics methodology24,25,26. HLA-B*07:02-, HLA-B*08:01- or HLA-B*35:01-expressing C1R cell lines were infected with IBV (B/Malaysia/2506/04) for 12 h followed by HLA-I isolation using the pan HLA-I antibody W6/32 and analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Human proteome derived peptides identified at a 1% false discovery rate (FDR) were consistent in length with HLA-I ligands. All datasets were dominated by 9-mer peptides (Fig. 2a), with HLA-B*08:01 also showing a high prevalence of 8-mer peptides which has been reported before33. HLA-B*07:02 and HLA-B*35:01 shared a preference for Proline at P2, while at PΩ (the C-terminal amino acid), B*07:02 showed a hierarchy of Leu»Phe/Val/Met/Ile and B*35:01 of Tyr>Leu/Phe/Met (Fig. 2b). In contrast, HLA-B*08:01 showed enrichment of positively charged amino acids (Arg and Lys) at P5 and, to a lesser extent, P3 of both 8- and 9-mer peptides, with Leu dominating PΩ. All of these anchor residues are consistent with previous findings34.Fig. 2: Identification of IBV peptides restricted by HLA-B*07:02, HLA-B*08:01 and HLA-B*35:01.a Length distribution of human proteome-derived peptides (non-redundant by sequence) identified at an FDR of 1% from immunopurification of HLA class I (using the pan HLA-I antibody W6/32) of C1R.B*07:02, C1R.B*08:01 and C1R.B*35:01. All data sets were filtered for peptides identified from the endogenous HLA-C*04:01 and HLA class II of C1R cells from previous experiments24,26, and peptides identified as possessing the HLA-C*04:01 binding motif via Gibbs cluster analysis. The C1R.B*08:01 data sets were also filtered of peptides isolated using W6/32 from the endogenous HLA-I of C1R. Human proteome derived peptides from uninfected and infected replicates are shown in black and pink, respectively. Points represent individual replicates, bars represent the mean number of peptides, error bars are standard deviation. Numbers of replicates: C1R.B*07:02—1 uninfected, 2 B/Malaysia infected; C1R.B*08:01—3 uninfected, 3 B/Malaysia infected; C1R.B*35:01—1 uninfected, 2 B/Malaysia infected. b Sequence motifs of preferred lengths for HLA-B*07:02 (9 and 10), HLA-B*08:01 (8 and 9) and HLA-B*35:01 (9 and 10). Motifs are based on human peptides of these lengths represented in (a). Motifs were made using Seq2Logo. c Length and (d) proteome (and alternative translation frame product; italicized) distribution of influenza B-derived peptides isolated in experiments using C1R.B*07:02, C1R.B*08:01 or C1R.B*35:01. Peptides predicted to bind the overexpressed HLA are denoted as strong binders (SB), weak binders (WB) or possible binders (PB) as per Supplementary Data 1. Peptides isolated in experiments that were not predicted to bind the overexpressed HLA are separated into the following categories: non-binder (NB)—8–14 amino acids in length and not predicted to bind any HLA expressed, Endogenous Class I—predicted to bind endogenous HLA class I of C1R as described in Supplementary Data 1, not classified—<8 or >14 amino acids length therefore binding prediction not performed. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageTo identify IBV peptides, a 5% peptide FDR was employed to minimize exclusion of flu derived peptides, with the data from uninfected cells utilized as an additional filter for false discovery24,25,26. IBV peptide sequences identified in isolations from HLA class II of C1R were excluded, however all other peptides were retained in the analysis and their predicted binding to both the transfected and endogenous HLA-I calculated with NetMHC4.0 (Supplementary Data 1). Twenty-four, 114, and 71 IBV peptide sequences were identified as binders of HLA-B*07:02, HLA-B*08:01 and HLA-B*35:01, respectively (Fig. 2c). For all three transfectant HLA-I, the length distribution of IBV peptides mirrored that observed for human peptides, dominated by 9-mers, with the HLA-B*08:01 data set also containing a large proportion of 8-mer peptides (Fig. 2c). Broad sampling of the IBV proteome was observed for HLA-B*08:01 and HLA-B*35:01, dominated by NP, NA, M1, HA, PB2, and NS1 for HLA-B*08:01, and HA, NA, and NP for HLA-B*35:01 (Fig. 2d). HLA-B*07:02 sampled NP, HA, NS1, PB1, NA and NS2. We also identified potential peptide binders from alternative reading frames for all three HLAs, including NP + 2180-188 and PB1 + 280-89, which were common to HLA-B*07:02 and HLA-B*08:01.The three previously identified HLA-B*08:01-restricted IBV peptides (NP30-38, NP263-271 and NP413-422) were all conserved in B/Malaysia/2506/04, however, only NP30-38 (RPIIRPATL) was identified in our immunopeptidome data, consistent with the observed lack of CD8+ T cell response towards NP263-271 and NP413-421 (Fig. 1e)20. NP30-38 was also one of eight peptides identified as a ligand for both HLA-B*07:02 and -B*08:01, despite their disparate binding motifs (Supplementary Data 1). Furthermore, NP30-38 was also not an HLA-B*35:01 ligand despite having anchor residues consistent with other -B*35:01 ligands (Fig. 2b).A selection of 21 HLA-B*07:02 peptides and 55 HLA-B*35:01 peptides were chosen for immunogenicity screening in vitro based on a combination of high quality of peptide identification and binding prediction for the transfected HLA-I. NP30-38 was also included as a potential HLA-B*35:01 peptide due to its anchor residues. For HLA-B*08:01, selections were further focused on in frame proteins, with 35 HLA-B*08:01 peptides selected for screening, including NS211-19 due to strong binding prediction despite identification at >5% FDR (Supplementary Data 1).Identification of immunogenic IBV-specific HLA-B*07:02-, HLA-B*08:01- and HLA-B*35:01-restricted IBV peptidesTo define CD8+ T cell immunogenicity towards our LC-MS/MS-identified IBV-derived peptides, we assigned those 112 peptides into 7 HLA specific peptide pools based on increasing predicted binding affinity towards their respective HLA (Supplementary Table 1). PBMCs obtained from healthy HLA-B*07:02-, HLA-B*08:01- or HLA-B*35:01-expressing individuals (Supplementary Table 2) were stimulated with their respective peptide pools for 10–12 days in vitro, followed by re-stimulation with the respective pool to measure IFN-γ and TNF production (Fig. 3a). CD8+ T cells responding to specific pools were further dissected using individual IBV-derived peptides.Fig. 3: CD8+ T cell reactivity to HLA-B*07:02-, HLA-B*08:01- and HLA-B*35:01-restricted IBV peptides.a Representative FACS plots of IFN-γ+TNF+ CD8+ T cells restimulated with peptide pools or individual IBV peptides. b Frequency of IFN-γ+TNF+ CD8+ T cells after restimulation with HLA-B*07:02-restricted peptide pool A (n = 6 donors) or B (n = 4 donors) and individual HLA-B*07:02 IBV peptides (n = 4 donors for pool A and n = 6 donors for pool B). c Frequency of IFN-γ+TNF+ CD8+ T cells after restimulation with HLA-B*08:01-restricted pool C (n = 6 donors) or D (n = 5 donors) and individual HLA-B*08:01 IBV peptides (n = 6 donors). d Frequency of IFN-γ+TNF+ CD8+ T cells after restimulation with HLA-B*35:01-restricted pool E, F, G and individual HLA-B*35:01 IBV peptides (n = 6 donors). Median and interquartile range (IQR) are shown. DMSO background was subtracted. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageFor HLA-B*07:02, both pool A and B stimulated IFN-γ and TNF production (Fig. 3b). Dissection of pool A and B identified five immunogenic HLA-B*07:02 peptides; NP30-38, NP233-244, NS1196-206, NS262-70 and HA255-263 responses in 5/6, 5/6, 3/4, 2/4, 2/4 donors respectively. For HLA-B*08:01, pool C stimulated IFN-γ and TNF production but not pool D (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 2a). Dissection of pool C revealed four immunogenic HLA-B*08:01 peptides; NP30-38 and NP92-99 responses in 5/6 and 3/6 donors respectively, whereas NP479-487 and NP468-476 induced a robust IFN-γ+TNF+CD8+ T cell response in one individual. HLA-B*35:01-derived pools E and F stimulated IFN-γ and TNF production, but not pool G (Fig. 3d and Supplementary Fig. 2a). Dissection of pools E and F identified five immunogenic HLA-B*35:01 peptides; NS1260-268, HA231-239, PB266-70 NP165-173 and NP468-476 responses in 4/6, 3/6, 4/6, 2/6 and 1/6 donors, respectively. Two donors responding to NP165-173 also expressed HLA-A*24:02.Overall, we identified 13 immunogenic IBV peptides in HLA-B*07:02- (5 peptides), HLA-B*08:01- (3 peptides) and HLA-B*35:01- (5 peptides) expressing individuals. The NP30-38 peptide was of particular interest as it was immunogenic in both HLA-B*07:02 and/or HLA-B*08:01-expressing donors, but no responses were observed for HLA-B*35:01-expressing donors (pool G; Fig. 3d).Verification of HLA restriction for the immunogenic IBV-derived peptidesFollowing identification of IBV-derived immunogenic peptides in HLA-B*07:02-, HLA-B*08:01- and HLA-B*35:01-expressing individuals, we subsequently verified the HLA restriction for the identified IBV peptides to rule out any potential peptide presentation by unrelated HLA alleles co-expressed in our donors. Particularly the B*35:01 associated NP165-173 peptide only generated responses in HLA-A*24:02+ and HLA-B*35:01+ individuals and was previously identified as an HLA-A*24:02-restricted epitope by our group26. We generated three new peptide pools consisting of 5 immunogenic HLA-B*07:02 peptides (pool H), 4 immunogenic HLA-B*08:01 peptides (pool I) and 5 immunogenic HLA-B*35:01 peptides (pool J) (Supplementary Table 3), for stimulating CD8+ T cells. Pool-specific CD8+ T cells were restimulated with C1R cell lines expressing HLA-B*07:02, HLA-B*08:01 or HLA-B*35:01 molecules which were pulsed with individual peptides from the corresponding pool and stained for IFN-γ/TNF production (Fig. 4a). Pool-specific CD8+ T cells were also restimulated with peptide-pool pulsed parental C1Rs to control for the low expression of HLA-B*35:03 and HLA-C*04:01 by C1Rs, which may elicit CD8+ T cell responses specific for those peptide-HLA (pHLA) combinations35.Fig. 4: CD8+ T cell responses towards HLA-B*07:02-, HLA-B*08:01 and HLA-B*35:01-restricted IBV epitopes.a Representative FACS plots of IFN-γ and TNF production by CD8+ T cells after restimulation with C1R.B*07:02, C1R.B*08:01, C1R.B*35:01 or C1R cells pulsed with immunogenic IBV peptides or pools.

Bars represent median and IQR. Overlapping peptides and peptide variants were counted as a single epitope (see “Methods”). Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageWe verified the HLA*07:02 restriction of peptides NP233-244 (response in 9/10 donors), NP30-38 (7/10 donors), NS1196-206 (6/10 donors) and HA255-263 (2/10 donors), but detected no responses towards NS262-70 (Fig. 4b). We verified the HLA-B*08:01 restriction for IBV-derived NP92-99 (6/9 donors) and NP479-487 (4/9 donors) peptides and confirmed the HLA-B*08:01 restriction for NP30-38 (5/9 donors) (Fig. 4c). No responses were identified against NP468-476. HLA-B*35:01-restriction was verified for NS1260-268 (5/6 donors), HA231-239 (3/6 donors) and PB266-70 (1/6 donors) peptides, while no responses were detected for NP468-476 peptide (Fig. 4d). Weak IFN-γ+TNF+CD8+ T cell responses for NP165-173 were only observed in HLA-B*35:01 donors who co-expressed HLA-A*24:02 (A5 and A17; Supplementary Table 2). We hypothesize that HLA-A*24:02 co-expression may result in HLA-B*35:01/NP165-173 (B35/NP165-173)-cross-reactive CD8+ T cell responses. Therefore, NP165-173 was not considered as a true HLA-B*35:01-restricted IBV epitope.HLA-restriction was further validated using peptide pHLA-I tetramer staining for 7 IBV epitopes that elicited the strongest IFN-γ+TNF+ CD8+ T cell responses (Fig. 4a–d) and displayed >99% conservation among IBVs circulating in the human population between 1940 and 2023 (Table 1 and Supplementary Data 2). This included 2 HLA-B*07:02 (B7/NP30, B7/NS1196), 3 HLA-B*08:01 (B8/NP30, B8/NP92, B8/NP479) and 2 HLA-B*35:01 (B35/HA231, B35/NS1260) tetramers. Prominent tetramer-staining was observed in IBV-specific CD8+ T cell lines that were expanded with their respective original peptide pool (A-G) (Fig. 4e–g). CD8+ T cells expanded with an unrelated peptide pool were used as a negative control. B35/NS1260-specific CD8+ T cells had a higher frequency of tetramer+CD8+ T cells compared to the frequency of IFN-γ+TNF+ CD8+ T cells following IBV peptide stimulation (Supplementary Fig. 2b), suggesting that not all IBV epitope-specific CD8+ T cells secrete both IFN-γ and TNF cytokines. Other IBV-specific CD8+ T cell populations stained with their respective tetramers also displayed a similar trend.Table 1 Conservation of IBV-derived immunogenic peptidesFull size tableOverall, we identified 9 IBV CD8+ T cell epitopes, with 4 restricted to HLA-B*07:02, 2 restricted to HLA-B*08:01 and 3 restricted to HLA-B*35:01, and confirmed the HLA-B*08:01 restriction of the previously identified NP30-38. Our study increases the overall number of known IBV CD8+ T cell epitopes by 50% as well as covering 2 additional prominent HLAs, HLA-B*07:02 and HLA-B*35:01. Of note, our newly-identified IBV epitopes were not conserved among IAV strains as we were unable to identify overlapping sequences within IAV proteins.Robust ex vivo frequencies of IBV-specific CD8+ T memory populations in healthy donorsTo probe the magnitude of IBV-specific CD8+ T cell populations directly ex vivo, we used tetramer-associated magnetic enrichment (TAME)36 in PBMCs from 22 HLA-B*07:02+, 19 HLA-B*08:01+ and 11 HLA-B*35:01+ healthy donors (Fig. 5, Supplementary Fig. 3a and Supplementary Table 2). Substantial tetramer+CD8+ T cell populations were directed against B7/NP30-38 (median frequency of 1.90 × 10−5), B7/NS1196-206 (2.65 × 10−5), B8/NP30-38 (9.50 × 10−6), B8/NP92-99 (2.35 × 10−5), B35/HA231-239 (1.70 × 10−5) and B35/NS1260-268 (6.77 × 10−5) epitopes (Fig. 5a, b). These magnitudes were comparable to previously published ex vivo IBV-specific CD8+ T cell frequencies for HLA-A*02:01- and HLA-A*24:02-restricted IBV-epitopes24,26. B35/NS1260+CD8+ T cell frequencies (6.77 × 10−5) were higher than B8/NP30+CD8+ (9.50 × 10−6) and B8/NP479+CD8+ (2.74 × 10−6) T cell frequencies (p = 0.0145 and p = 0.0017, respectively). Low prevalence of B8/NP479+CD8+ T cells was evident and 7/11 donors had <10 B8/NP479+CD8+ T cells, thus this epitope was not studied beyond phenotypic analysis.Fig. 5: Ex vivo detection of IBV-specific CD8+ T cells in healthy PBMCs.a Representative FACS plots of enriched IBV-specific CD8+ T cells. b Frequency of B7/NP30+CD8+ T cells (n = 19 donors), B7/NS1196+CD8+ T cells (n = 19), B8/NP30+CD8+ T cells (n = 18), B8/NP92+CD8+ T cells (n = 18), B8/NP479+CD8+ T cells (n = 11), B35/HA231+CD8+ T cells (n = 10 donors) and B35/NS1260+CD8+ T cells (n = 10).

Statistical significance was determined with using a two-sided Kruskal–Wallis with Dunn’s test for multiple comparisons (b) or two-way ANOVA with two-sided Tukey’s test for multiple comparisons (d). Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageTo define ex vivo phenotype of IBV-specific tetramer+CD8+ T cells, we analyzed expression of CD27, CD45RA and CD95 to discriminate between central memory (Tcm; CD27+CD45RA−), effector memory (Tem; CD27−CD45RA−), terminally differentiated effector memory (Temra; CD27−CD45RA+), stem cell memory (Tscm; CD27+CD45RA+CD95+) and naive (Tnaive; CD27+CD45RA+CD95−) CD8+ T cell phenotypes (Fig. 5c). Cell populations with <10 acquired tetramer+CD8+ T cells were excluded from phenotypic analyses37. Tcm phenotype was more enriched in IBV-specific CD8+ T cells compared to total CD8+ T cells, whereas Temra phenotype was less prominent (Fig. 5d).Overall, our findings provide evidence for substantial ex vivo pools of IBV-specific tetramer+CD8+ T cells circulating in peripheral blood and expressing predominantly memory Tcm phenotype in healthy adults.IBV-specific CD8+ T cell responses decline with ageCD8+ T cells directed towards IAV-derived epitopes substantially change throughout the human lifespan at numerical, phenotypic and transcriptomic levels38,39,40. An unanswered question remains how IBV-specific CD8+ T cells change throughout immunologically-distinct phases of life, especially given age-related IBV disease severity7,8,9. We sought to define the magnitude and phenotype of IBV-specific CD8+ T cells across three age groups (6 children <18 years; 28 adults 18–59 years; 9 elderly adults >60 years) (Fig. 6a). Pooled analysis revealed that IBV-specific CD8+ T cell responses peaked in adults and declined in the elderly (Fig. 6b). Similar trends were observed within HLA-B*07:02+ donors and HLA-B*08:01+ donors but could not be confirmed in HLA-B*35:01+ individuals, due to the lack of available elderly HLA-B*35:01+ donors (Fig. 6c).Fig. 6: Age-associated changes to IBV-specific CD8+ T cells.a Representative FACS plots of B7/NP30+CD8+ T cells across age. b Frequency of pooled IBV-specific CD8+ T cells across age groups (n = 43 donors).

Colors represent different tetramers. Open symbols represent <10 tetramer+ cells counted. d Proportions of phenotypes of IBV-specific CD8+ T cells in children, adults and elderly donors for all IBV tetramer+ populations (n = 38 donors). b–d Statistical significance was determined using a two-sided Kruskal–Wallis with Dunn’s test for multiple comparisons for pooled and HLA-B*07:02 and HLA-B*08:01 tetramers and (c) two-sided Mann–Whitney U test for HLA-B*35:01 tetramers. Bars represent median and IQR. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imagePhenotypic analysis revealed that Tcm frequencies of pooled IBV-specific tetramer+CD8+ T cells increased with age and peaked in the elderly (median Tcm frequency in children 27.4%, adults 61.9%, elderly 75.2%) (Fig. 6d), which was also observed for HLA-B*07:02-restricted IBV tetramer+CD8+ T cells (Supplementary Fig. 3b). This was in agreement with our recent observation for IAV-specific CD8+ T cells directed at the HLA-A*02:01-restricted M158-66 (A2/M158) epitope41. In contrast, total CD8+ Tcm populations were stable with age while the Tnaive population decreased with age and Temra/Tem cells increased (Supplementary Fig. 3c), in line with previous reports39,41.In summary, despite maintaining a predominant Tcm phenotype across the human lifespan, IBV-specific CD8+ T cell populations decline in magnitude with age.IBV-specific CD8+ T cells in human tissues express a tissue resident phenotypeThus far, we have focussed on IBV-specific CD8+ T cells within peripheral blood. However, tissue-resident memory T (Trm) cell populations are important for protective immunity, especially towards respiratory viral infections42. Mouse models show lung-resident T cells protect against severe influenza disease outcomes43,44. We thus assessed the prevalence and phenotype of IBV-specific CD8+ T cells in human lungs (n = 6 donors), mesenteric lymph nodes (LN; n = 11) and spleens (n = 15) from deceased donors and tonsils (n = 15) from routine tonsillectomies (Supplementary Table 2).Median frequencies of pooled IBV tetramer+CD8+ T cells ranged between 1.63 × 10−5 and 1.40 × 10−4 in human tissues, with higher frequencies in LN (1.40 × 10−4) and tonsils (3.84 × 10−5) compared to spleen (1.63 × 10−5) (Fig. 7a). LN frequencies were also higher than PBMCs (2.56 × 10−5). Similar trends were observed for HLA-B*07:02-restricted IBV tetramer+CD8+ T cells, albeit not significant.Fig. 7: IBV-specific CD8+ T cells across human tissues.a Frequencies of total IBV-specific CD8+ T cells in human lungs (n = 6 donors), tonsils (n = 15), lymph nodes (n = 11), spleen (n = 15) and PBMCs (n = 43).

Statistical significance was determined using a two-sided Kruskal–Wallis with Dunn’s test for multiple comparisons (a) or two-way ANOVA with two-sided Tukey’s test for multiple comparisons (c, d). Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageTo establish whether IBV tetramer+CD8+ T cells in human tissues displayed a Trm phenotype, we assessed CD69 and CD103 expression on IBV tetramer+CD8+ T cells in lungs, secondary lymphoid organs (SLOs; tonsils and LN) and spleens (Fig. 7b). Higher proportions of CD69+CD103+ and CD69+CD103− Trm were detected within the pooled IBV tetramer+CD8+ T cell population in lungs (29.9% and 34.4%, respectively) compared to spleen (12.3% and 18.1%, respectively), which was associated with lower CD69−CD103− subset in lungs (33.1%) compared to spleens (65.8%) and secondary lymphoid organs (SLOs; 56.4%) (Fig. 7c). Similar trends were observed for individual IBV tetramer+CD8+ T cells albeit not significant, except for B8/NP92+CD8+ T cells.Higher Tem populations in pooled and individual IBV tetramer+CD8+ T cells were mainly observed in the lung and spleen compared to circulating IBV tetramer+CD8+ T cells, while Tnaive populations were mainly detected in SLOs and in circulation (Fig. 7d), in line with the expected trafficking patterns of these memory T cell subsets45,46. When analyzing individual tetramer+CD8+ T cells, the pattern of memory phenotypes for each tissue matched the overall IBV-specific CD8+ T cell population.LN and spleen samples obtained from the same individuals (n = 12 donors) were analyzed to assess organ-related differences in IBV-specific CD8+ T cell frequency and phenotype within these individuals (Supplementary Fig. 4). Higher frequencies of IBV tetramer+CD8+ T cells, both pooled and individual responses, were detected in LN (median 1.4 × 10−4) compared to spleens (median 1.52 × 10−5). Likewise, proportions of IBV-specific CD69+CD103+CD8+ Trm were higher in the LN (median 19.7%) compared to spleens (median 5.0%), albeit not significant.Overall, we identified prominent IBV tetramer+CD8+ Trm cell populations in five human tissues demonstrating that IBV tetramer+CD8+ T cells are poised to provide protection at the site of IBV infection (lung). We also show that IBV-specific tetramer+CD8+ T cells are found at a higher frequency in LNs compared to spleen but are not necessarily resident within the LN.B*07:02-restricted 11 amino acid long NS1196-206 peptide bulges out of the peptide-binding cleftAlthough representing approximately 11% of HLA-B*07:02 ligands (Fig. 2a), 11mer peptides such as, the NS1196-206 peptide are considered long with regards to the structural constraints of the HLA-I binding cleft47. Long peptides can either have N or C terminal overhangs48 or bulge out of the HLA-peptide binding cleft eliciting either highly restricted49 or diverse TCR repertoires50, which can be associated with lower epitope-specific CD8+ T cell frequencies when associated with higher mobility32. To establish whether the NS1196-206 peptide also bulges out of the HLA-B*07:02 peptide binding cleft, we crystallized and solved the structure of HLA-B*07:02-NS1196-206 at a resolution of 2.4 Å (Fig. 8a and Supplementary Table 4). Structural analysis showed that the peptide NS1196-206 interacts with hydrogen bonds to side chain residues of HLA α1 and α2 helices. Considering the anchor residues at the extremities of the peptide (P2 and PΩ), the 11-mer peptide bulged out from central P4-Gly to P8-Leu to adopt stable conformation and providing a surface for TCR recognition. In terms of HLA-I and peptide specificity, polymorphic residues Asp-114, and Glu-152 form hydrogen bonds with the side chain of P6-Lys and P9-Ser, respectively (Fig. 8a). Accordingly, the NS1196-206 epitope forms a stable conformation that bulges out of the HLA-B*07:02 cleft, which is in accordance with the relatively robust B7/NS1196-specific CD8+ T cell frequencies (Fig. 5b).Fig. 8: Crystal structures of IBV peptides presented by HLA-B*07:02.a Crystal structure of HLA-B*07:02-NS1196-206 where HLA-B*07:02 is represented as an gray/orange cartoon while NS1196-206 is represented as pink sticks. b Cartoon representation of the crystal structure of the NP30-38 peptide when presented by HLA-B*07:02 (color coding as in (a)) with the positions of the P2 and PΩ labeled. Key residues interacting with the P5-Arg are labeled. c Overlay of the P5-Arg pockets in HLA-B*07:02, -B*08:01 and -B*35:01 demonstrating polymorphisms incompatible with the downward P5-Arg.Full size imagePresentation of NP30-38 in the context of HLA-B*07:02We sought to assess whether structural differences of NP30-38 bound by HLA-B*07:02 or HLA-B*08:01 allomorphs could underpin similarities or differences in the responding TCR repertoires. Antigen presentation of NP30-38 (RPIIRPATL) peptide bound to HLA-B*07:02-NP30-38 was assessed after obtaining a 2.2 Å resolution structure (Fig. 8b, c). Canonical TCR-docking modes often focus heavily near the mid-point of the α1/2 helices such that central epitope residues play a key role in TCR recognition. Within the HLA-B*07:02-NP30-38 complex the P5-Arg is directed towards the HLA platform leaving the P3 and P4-Ile and P6-Pro as likely determinants for T cell engagement (Fig. 8b). HLA-B*07:02 shares 95% sequence identity with HLA-B*08:01, but a significant point-of-difference is an Asp114Asn polymorphism. Superposing the HLA-B*08:01 structure with HLA-B*07:02-NP30-38 indicates that Asn-114 is capable of accepting the platform-directed P5-Arg within HLA B*08:01 (Fig. 8c) with minimal changes.Since NP30-38 has anchor residues that match the HLA-B*35:01 binding motifs (Fig. 2b), we sought a structural explanation of why we could not detect HLA-B35:01/NP30+CD8+ T cell responses (Fig. 3d). Superposing HLA-B*35:01 with HLA-B*07:02-NP30-38 shows that presence of the Arg97 polymorphism within the HLA-B*35:01 allomorph would align a positively charged HLA residue at a similar position to that of P5-Arg from within the NP30-38 epitope. Repulsion of like-charges may limit peptide binding (Fig. 8c) or require significant changes to epitope conformation for this pHLA combination.Overall, the structural analyses indicated the NP30-38 peptide can be accommodated with both HLA-B*07:02 and HLA-B*08:01. However, allele specific polymorphisms may result in structural differences of NP30-38 presentation depending on the allomorph. Our data also suggested that NP30-38 would form a stable interaction with HLA-B*35:01, providing a potential explanation as to why no HLA-B*35:01/NP30+ CD8+ T cell response was detected against this allomorph.Distinct TCRαβ repertoires are elicited towards B7/NP30 and B8/NP30 epitopesGiven the presentation of the IBV NP30-38 peptide by HLA-B7:02 and HLA-B*08:01, we asked whether B7/NP30+CD8+ and B8/NP30+CD8+ T cell responses consisted of cross-reactive TCRαβ clonotypes. To this end, we co-stained PBMCs obtained from HLA-B*07:02 and HLA-B*08:01 double-positive and single-positive individuals with B7/NP30-PE and B8/NP30-APC tetramers (Fig. 9a). Although we identified single-positive B7/NP30+CD8+ and/or B8/NP30+CD8+ T cells across all individuals, we did not detect any cross-reactive double-positive B7/NP30+B8/NP30+CD8+ T cells. This suggests a lack of shared TCRs directed towards B7/NP30+CD8+ and B8/NP30+CD8+ T cells. We identified no significant differences in B7/NP30+ or B8/NP30+ CD8+ T cell frequencies between HLA-B*07:02 and HLA-B*08:01 single-positive and double-positive individuals, however a trend for lower frequencies was observed in HLA-B*08:01-expressing donors (Supplementary Fig. 5a). A phenotypic comparison of B7/NP30- and B8/NP30-specific CD8+ T cell populations in HLA-B*07:02 and HLA-B*08:01 single-positive and double-positive individuals revealed a prominent B7/NP30 Tcm population in HLA-B*07:02-expressing donors regardless of HLA-B*08:01 co-expression, while a visually apparent but statistically indistinguishable trend for higher B8/NP30 Tcm frequencies was observed for HLA-B*08:01-expressing donors versus double-positive donors (Supplementary Fig. 5b). These results indicate that co-expression of HLA-B*07:02 and HLA-B*08:01 may result in lower recruitment of B8/NP30+CD8+ T cells, which could potentially be explained by the slightly reduced binding affinity of NP30-38 to HLA-B*08:01 compared to HLA-B*07:02 (Supplementary Data 1). Since TCRαβ repertoire diversity and clonal composition affect functionality of epitope-specific CD8+ T cells32,41,51, we dissected the B7/NP30+CD8+ and B8/NP30+CD8+ TCRαβ repertoires and compared those with TCRαβ signatures within other immunodominant HLA*B*07:02- and HLA-B*08:01-restricted CD8+ T cell epitopes, namely B7/NS1196-206 and B8/NP92-99. Overall, we analyzed 236 paired TCRαβ clonotypes, 23 single TCRα and 148 TCRβ chains. For each epitope, an average of 55 TCRαβ clonotypes were analyzed across 5-6 donors (Supplementary Tables 6–9). 2D kernel principal component analysis (kPCA) projections of the TCR Vα, Vβ, Jα and Jβ gene segment landscape revealed that the overall TCRαβ repertoire of HLA-B*07:02- and HLA-B*08:01-restricted IBV epitopes was highly diverse (Fig. 9b).Fig. 9: TCRαβ repertoire of IBV-specific CD8+ T cells.a FACS plots of HLA-B*07:02+HLA-B*08:01+ individuals after dual B7/NP30 and B8/NP30 tetramer staining and enrichment. b 2D kernel principal component analysis (kPCA) projections of B7/NP30+CD8+, B8/NP30+CD8+, B7/NS1196+CD8+ and B8/NP92+CD8+ TCR landscapes colored by Vα, Jα, Vβ and Jβ gene usage (left to right). c TCRdiv diversity measures of the TCRα, TCRβ or paired TCRαβ chains. d Smoothed density profiles of neighbor distance distribution are shown for each epitope.

Each logo depicts the V- (left side) and J- (right side) gene frequencies with the CDR3 amino acid sequence in the middle with the full height (top) and scaled (bottom) by per-residue reparative entropy to background frequencies derived from TCRs with matching gene-segment composition to highlight motif positions under selection. The middle section indicates the inferred rearrangement structure by source region (light gray for V-region, dark gray for J, black for D and red for N-insertions) of the grouped receptors. Motif scores were determined by chi-squared, with values above 90 considered significant. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageThis was also reflected by high TCR diversity scores (TCRdiv) for single TCRα, TCRβ and paired TCRαβ repertoires relative to B8/NP30 (Fig. 9c). Neighbor distance distributions were calculated to measure the density within each epitope-specific TCR repertoire and quantify the relative contribution of clustered and diverged TCRs. Lower average values of the distance distribution peak represented a more similar clustering of clonotypes (Fig. 9d). The level of clustering greatly varied between the studied IBV epitope-specific CD8+ T cell populations. A bimodal distribution that was mainly driven by the TCRβ chain was observed for B8/NP30, whereas the bimodal distribution of B7/NS1196 was driven by both the TCRα and β chain. In contrast, B7/NP30 TCRαβ had an overall lower similarity in clustering of the paired TCRαβ clonotypes, which was mainly driven by high diversity in the TCRβ chain. Highest diversity was however observed for B8/NP92 (Fig. 9d). Overall, 2–8 clonotypes were expanded per donor per epitope (Supplementary Tables 6–9). Very little clonotype sharing was observed, indicative of private TCR repertoires.To understand whether the observed differences in TCRαβ diversity were related to gene segment usage, V and J genes (Vα, Vβ, Jα, Jβ) were analyzed for each epitope (Fig. 9e, f and Supplementary Fig. 5c). B7/NP30+ TCRαβ repertoire revealed a preference for the TRAV1-2 gene segment and a diverse TRBV gene usage, consistent with our finding of the TCRα chain driving clustering in our neighbor distance analysis. TRAV1-2 usage was observed in 5/6 donors (regardless of whether they co-expressed HLA-B*07:02 and HLA-B*08:01) but was particularly prominent in two donors (A10 and A27). B8/NP30+CD8+ TCRαβ repertoire was dominated by TRBV19-expressing clonotypes detected in all 5 donors and was frequently paired with TRBJ1-1 and TRAV14/DV4 and diverse TRAJ usage. The B8/NP30+ CD8+ TCRαβ repertoire was more diverse in donors who co-expressed HLA-B*07:02, suggesting that co-expression of these alleles may alter the B8/NP30+ TCRαβ repertoire52,53. B7/NS1196+CD8+ TCRαβ repertoire was dominated by TRBV27-TRAV38-2/DV8 expressing clonotypes paired with a variety of TRAJ and TRBJ gene segments and was detected in 3/6 donors (Fig. 9e, f and Supplementary Fig. 5c). TRAV19-expressing clonotypes were also observed in all donors but paired with different TRAJ, TRBV and TRBJ gene segments, which matched the two clusters in the kPCA projections. In line with the kPCA and neighbor distance distribution analysis, the B8/NP92-specific TCRαβ repertoire was highly diverse in gene usage.In summary, all IBV-specific TCRαβ repertoires were relatively diverse, with pockets of clustering clonotypes observed for B7/NP30, B8/NP30 and B7/NS1196, but not B8/NP92-specific T cells. Furthermore, B7/NP30+CD8+ and B8/NP30+CD8+ T cells have vastly distinct pHLA-I specificities as confirmed by their different gene segments and distinct TCRαβ repertoires.Distinct CDR3αβ motifs of HLA-B*07:02 and HLA-B*08:01-restricted CD8+ T cellsThe TCRs hypervariable complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3)α and CDR3β regions often mediate the fine pHLA class I specificity. We therefore used TCRdist to dissect the CDR3αβ clonotypic signatures by establishing their amino acid motif similarities to highlight key conserved residues that drive IBV epitope-specific TCR recognition (Fig. 9g). We identified a single TRAV1-2-TRAJ36-associated CDR3α-“CAVREGTG” motif (CDR3α chi-squared (chi-sq) 182.2) and a weaker TRBV5-4-associated CDR3β-“SDRExGG”-motif (chi-sq 90.2) for B7/NP30+CD8+ TCRs. Neither motif was among the high frequency clonotypes, as their prominence was mainly driven by singletons (Supplementary Tables 5 and 6). For B8/NP30+ CD8+ TCRs, only a strong TRBV19-TRBJ1-1-associated CDR3β-“ASSxxPDMN” motif was identified (chi-sq 552.2), which was present in high frequency clonotypes in 3 donors or singletons in one other donor (Supplementary Tables 5 and 7). B7/NS1196-206-specific CDR3α motifs were dominated by a TRAV38/DV8-associated CDR3α-“YRSAxxYxLIW/F” motif (chi-sq 132.2), highly prevalent clonotypes in 1/6 donors and singletons in 2/6 donors, while a strong TRBV27-associated CDR3β-“CASSLYx” motif (chi-sq 306.2) was detected in highly prevalent clonotypes in 2/6 donors and singletons in 4/6 donors (Supplementary Tables 5 and 8). B8/NP92+CD8+ TCRs displayed a TRBJ2-3-associated CDR3β-“xRxDTQ” motif, identified among high prevalent clonotypes and singletons (Supplementary Tables 5 and 9). No B8/NP92+CD8+ CDR3α motifs were identified.Overall, CDR3αβ motifs within HLA-B*07:02 and -B*08:02-restricted CD8+ T cell populations are distinct and present in either high prevalence clonotypes or singletons.DiscussionDespite the burden of IBV2, only 18 IBV CD8+ T cell epitopes have been reported to date24,25,26,27,28,29. A broader array of highly conserved IBV CD8+ T cell epitopes is needed if we are to elicit effective CD8+ T cell immunity via a rational design of the universal cross-reactive IBV vaccine. Using our immunopeptidomics platform and in vitro peptide stimulation analyses, provide 209 IBV peptides, including alternative reading frame and >10 amino acid peptides, for future investigation. Overall, we identified 9 IBV CD8+ T cell peptides restricted to the prominent HLA-B*07:02 (B7/NP30-38, B7/NP233-244, B7/NS1196-206, B7/HA255-263), HLA-B*08:01 (B8/NP92-99, B8/NP479-487) and HLA-B*35:01 (B35/NS1260-268, B35/HA231-239, B35/PB66-74) alleles. Additionally, we confirmed B8/NP30-38 as an HLA-B*08:01-restricted epitope. Our study thus increased the overall number of known IBV CD8+ T cell epitopes by 50% and covers 2 additional prominent HLA allomorphs, HLA-B*07:02 and HLA-B*35:01. Ex vivo phenotypic analyses revealed predominant Tcm memory phenotype in IBV-specific tetramer+CD8+ T cells within PBMCs, and Trm memory phenotype in tissues, especially in lungs, indicating establishment of IBV-specific Trm populations during past IBV infections. The frequencies of IBV-specific CD8+ T cells peaked in adults, and although Tcm populations peaked in elderly, there was a sharp decline in their naïve IBV-specific T cell compartment. Furthermore, our analyses of IBV-specific CD8+ TCRαβ repertoires revealed high levels of TCR diversity within and between donors directed towards 4 IBV epitopes (B7/NP30-38, B7/NS1196-206, B8/NP30-38 and B8/NP92-99).Current inactivated influenza vaccines elicit substantial neutralizing antibodies against the vaccine strains but provide limited protection when the vaccine strains do not antigenically match the circulating strains. A key feature of CD8+ T cells is their ability to recognize peptides derived from conserved internal influenza proteins driving interest in T cell-based universal cross-reactive vaccine strategies24. All epitopes identified in this study were highly conserved among known B/Victoria and B/Yamagata influenza B viruses (>99%), except NP233-244 which was 91.9% conserved. These IBV-specific CD8+ T cells are therefore likely to contribute to robust cross-reactivity to both IBV lineages20, which makes them an important asset for future T cell-based influenza vaccines. For almost four decades, two influenza B lineages, B/Victoria and B/Yamagata, have been co-circulating during influenza seasons2,54. The B/Yamagata lineage has not been detected since 202012,55 due to the strict COVID-19 restrictions affecting circulation of other respiratory viruses. However, B/Yamagata viruses might still circulate locally at low levels in some parts of the world with potential to resurface globally in the future. Establishment of IBV-specific CD8+ T cell responses towards highly conserved epitopes would provide some level of protection against IBV viruses of both B/Victoria and B/Yamagata influenza B lineages.Previous studies established that age-related immunological changes, including those within the CD8+ T cell compartment, may explain differences in disease severity across the human lifespan41,56. Indeed, IAV, IBV, SARS-CoV-2 and RSV have all demonstrated age-related differences in disease severity across human life. While RSV is most severe in young children57, IAV causes severe disease in young children and elderly individuals6 and COVID-19 particularly impacted the elderly58. However, IBVs cause severe infections in school-aged children5,7,8. As age-related changes in IAV39,41 and SARS-CoV-259,60-specific CD8+ T cell populations have been previously detected, we hypothesized that age-related differences in IBV-specific CD8+ T cells may explain the susceptibility of older children to IBV. We found that IBV-specific CD8+ T cell populations peaked in adults and declined in the elderly, similar to what we observed in IAV A2/M158-specific CD8+ T cells38. However, in contrast to IAV-specific CD8+ T cells, the observed decline in IBV-specific CD8+ T cells was associated with reduced frequencies of naïve IBV-specific CD8+ T cells and further increasing Tcm populations. The maintenance of high Tcm frequencies directed against conserved IBV epitopes may provide substantial protection against severe IBV disease at older age, due to a high level of conservation within the immunogenic peptides across IBV strains. In contrast, children’s IBV-specific CD8+ T cells expressed a mixed naïve/memory phenotype, which may be related to the number of exposures. A similar trend was observed for IAV A2/M158-specific CD8+ T cells and may be attributed to the accumulation of repeated IAV exposures throughout childhood41. This, however, does not explain why older children are at higher risk for severe IBV infections. One important difference between IAV and IBV viruses is that the first IBV exposure often occurs at a later age61,62. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic demonstrated that young children benefitted from a strong innate immune response63,64, while dampening the SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cell response59,60. It will therefore be interesting to understand whether IBV-infected young versus older children mount different immune responses upon their first IBV encounter, resulting in either protective or detrimental disease outcomes.We identified a single peptide, NP30-38, is restricted by two HLA allomorphs, HLA-B*07:02 and HLA-B*08:01. A few examples of peptides binding multiple HLAs (named peptide promiscuity) have been previously described65,66,67,68. Three notable examples include (1) IAV M158-66 peptide restricted by HLA-A*02:0169 and HLA-C*08:0168, (2) IAV NP418-426 peptide presented by HLA-B*07:02, HLA-B*35:01 and HLA-B*35:0365,67, and (3) human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-derived Pol448–456 peptide, presented by HLA-B*35:01, HLA-B*51:01, HLA-B*53:01, and HLA-B*07:0266. Strikingly, the same CD8+ TCR, Vα12.1/Vβ5.6, can recognize the Pol448–456 peptide when presented on these HLA-I alleles. In contrast, the TCR repertoires of B7/NP30+CD8+ and B8/NP30+CD8+ T cells do not overlap. Distinct TCR repertoires suggest structural differences between HLA-B*07:02 or HLA-B*08:01 when presenting NP30-38. Indeed, even subtle structural variations in pHLA conformation can have an impact on the TCR repertoire70,71.In addition to B7/NP30-38- and B8/NP30-38-specific CD8+ TCR repertoires, we also defined B7/NS1196+CD8+ and B8/NP92+CD8+ TCR repertoires. At 11 amino acids long, the NS1196-206 peptide has a length that surpasses the typical 8-10 amino acid length of HLA-I ligands47, leading to a bulging confirmation when presented on HLA-B*07:02 consistent with other long (≥11 amino acids) HLA-I ligands32,50. Stable bulging peptides are usually associated with highly restricted/clonal TCR repertoires49, whereas structural flexibility of bulging peptides more often results in diverse TCR repertoires50,72,73. In the case of B7/NS1196-206, we observed a diverse TCR repertoire, which may be reflective of the low mobility of the bulged section.In summary, we identified 9 IBV epitopes and provided important insights in IBV-specific CD8+ T cell immunity across different tissue compartments and the human lifespan. Our identified IBV epitopes expand the number of IBV epitopes by 50%, which is of great importance for T cell based influenza vaccines, which provide an important layer of protection against severe IBV disease. We also defined age-related decrease in the frequencies of IBV-specific CD8+ T cells and accumulation of Tcm with age, which resembles our findings in IAV A2/M158+CD8+ T cells41.MethodsStudy participants and ethics statementAdult and elderly participants were recruited via the University of Melbourne (UoM; Melbourne, Australia), Deepdene Medical Clinic (DMC; Deepdene, Australia) and the Australian Red Cross Lifeblood (ARCL; Melbourne, Australia). Children peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and children and adult tonsils were recruited via the Launceston General Hospital (Tasmania, Australia) from healthy individuals undergoing tonsillectomy. Lung samples were obtained from the Alfred Hospital’s Lung Tissue Biobank. Spleen samples were obtained from DonateLife Victoria. All participants or their guardians provided informed written consent. HLA class I molecular genotyping was performed from genomic DNA by the ARCL. HLA profiles were used to select donors expressing HLA-B*07:02, HLA-B*08:01 and/or HLA-B35*01. PBMCs were isolated using Ficoll-Paque (GE Health-Care) gradient centrifugation, and cryopreserved in liquid N2 until required. Tissues were processed and cryopreserved in liquid N2 as described17. Experiments were conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki Principles and according to the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council Code of Practice. The study was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC) of the University of Melbourne Experiments (Ethics ID 13344, 24567), Australian Red Cross Lifeblood (ID 2015#8) and Tasmanian Health and Medical HREC (ID H0017479).Cell lines and reagentsParental C1R74 (a gift from Weisan Chen, La Trobe University), C1R.B*07:0275, C1R.B*08:0174,76 (a gift from Zhenjun Chen, University of Melbourne) and C1R.B*35:0174 (a gift from Anthony Purcell, Monash University) cell lines were maintained in RF10 medium (RPMI1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2mM L-glutamine (Gibco), 1 mM MEM sodium pyruvate (Gibco), 100 µM MEM non-essential amino acids (Gibco), 5 mM HEPES buffer solution (Gibco), 55 µM 2-mercaptoethanol (Gibco), 100 U/ml penicillin (Gibco), 100 µg/ml streptomycin (Gibco) and 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco). Influenza B (IBV, B/Malaysia/2506/04) virus was grown in the allantoic cavity of day 10-old embryonated chicken eggs for 3 days at 35 °C and viral titers were determined by plaque assay on MDCK cells (American Type Culture Collection). Peptides were purchased from GenScript or Mimotopes and reconstituted to 1 mM with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; Sigma-Aldrich).Previously discovered IBV epitopesThe Immune Epitope Database (IEDB)30 was used to search for known IBV CD8+ T cell epitopes. The parameters for the search were for linear peptides, human hosts, T cell assays and MHC Class I restriction. References for each peptide were analyzed to ensure that epitopes were confirmed ex vivo, in vitro or in vivo, excluding peptides not claimed as being epitopes by the respective studies. Peptides with single amino acid substitutions or overlapping sequences were counted as a single epitope.LC-MS/MS analysis of immunopeptidomeC1R were infected at MOI5 for 12hrs and snap frozen as previously26. HLA class I complexes were isolated as described31. Briefly, C1R cell pellets were disrupted by cryogenic milling (Retsch Mixer Mill MM 400) and lysed with 0.5% IGEPAL CA-630, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl and protease inhibitors (cOmplete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Tablet; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 1 h at 4 °C with rolling. Lysates were cleared by ultracentrifugation and the HLA class I complexes isolated by immunoaffinity purification using pan-HLA class I antibody (W6/32) bound to protein-A-agarose. Peptide-HLA were dissociated with 10% acetic acid and fractionated by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Fractions containing peptides were combined into 9–10 pools, vacuum-concentrated, then reconstituted in 15 µl 0.1% formic acid in Optima™ LC-MS water with indexed retention time (iRT) peptides77. Peptides were analyzed by LC-MS/MS on a Q-Exactive Plus Hybrid Quadrupole Orbitrap (Thermo Fisher Scientific) as described24,25.Bioinformatic analysis of LC-MS/MS dataFor each cell line, spectra were searched in an individual project using PEAKXPRO v10.6 (Bioinformatics Solutions Inc) database search. Spectra were searched against the reviewed human proteome (downloaded from UniProt March 2022) with the proteome and 6 frame translated nucleotide sequence of influenza B/Malaysia/2506/04 virus appended, and the iRT peptides. False Discovery Rate (FDR) analysis was performed by decoy-fusion. The following settings were applied: Instrument: Orbitrap (Orbi-Orbi), Fragment: HCD, Acquisition: DDA, Associate Chimera Scan: Enabled, Parent Mass Error Tolerance: 10.0 ppm, Fragment Mass Error Tolerance: 0.02 Da, Precursor Mass Search Type: Monoisotopic, Enzyme: None, Digest Mode: Unspecific, Variable Modifications: Oxidation (M) +15.99 Da, Cysteinylation +119.00 Da and Deamidation (NQ) +0.98 Da, Max Variable PTM Per Peptide: 3. Data from previous analyses of presentation by endogenous HLA of C1R cells (endogenous HLA data sets: A/X3126, B/Malaysia/2506/0424) were searched with the same settings.To characterize the binding motifs, a peptide-level FDR cut-off of 1% was applied. Analyses were performed with non-redundant human peptide sequences. For all HLA transfectants, peptide sequences were excluded if identified in immunoprecipitations of endogenous HLA of the C1R derivates using DT9 (isolates HLA-C*04:01) or a mix of LB3.1, SPV-L3 and B721 (isolate HLA-DR, -DQ and -DP) in the endogenous HLA data sets24,26. The C1R.B*08:01 dataset was further filtered of peptide sequences isolated using W6/32 in the endogenous HLA data sets to remove endogenous HLA-B*35:03 binders. This was not performed for the C1R.B*07:02 and C1R.B*35:01 datasets to avoid elimination of binders shared with the transfectant HLA given HLA-B*07:02, HLA-B*35:01 and HLA-B*35:03 all favor Proline at P2. Gibbs cluster analysis was performed on the unfiltered human 8-13mers for each data set using GibbsCluster2.078,79 (recommended configuration MHC class I ligands of length 8-13), and those peptide sequences that clustered with experimentally identified HLA-C*04:01 ligands were also excluded (Supplementary Fig. 6). Sequence Logos were generated with Seq2Logo2.0 using default settings80 and graphs were generated using GraphPad Prism 9.5 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, California USA, www.graphpad.com).To characterize influenza peptides, a peptide FDR cut-off of 5% was set. Peptide assignments mapping to the influenza proteome or 6 frame genome translation were excluded if identified in both uninfected and infected samples with similar spectra and retention times. For peptides mapping to alternative reading frames, naming and positional numbering was according to the frame starting at the start of the viral UTR, with stop codons counted as an amino acid. Predicted binding affinities of peptides between 8–14 amino acids in length to the transfected HLA (HLA-B*07:02, HLA-B*08:01 or HLA-B*35:01) and endogenous HLA (HLA-B*35:03 and HLA-C*04:01) were calculated using NetMHC4.081,82 using the native peptide sequence (unless otherwise stated), and assigned as strong binders (SB) and weak binders (WB) if the % rank was below 0.5 and 2, respectively. Peptides were considered potential binders of HLA-B*08:01 if the % rank or nM Affinity was lower than that for B*35:03 and C*04:01 and below 20. For B*07:02 and B*35:01, peptides were considered potential binders if the % rank or nM Affinity was lower than that for C*04:01 and below 20. For B*07:02 and B*35:01 predicted binding to B*35:03 was not considered to reduce likelihood of binding the transfected HLA due to similar preference for Proline at P2. As with human-derived peptides, sequences seen in endogenous HLA-class II data sets24 were excluded in figures, however these identifications are noted in Supplementary Data 1.Datasets have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE83 partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD045000 and 10.6019/PXD045000.Expansion of IBV-specific CD8+ T cells from human PBMCsPBMCs (3–5 × 106) were used to expand antigen-specific CD8+ T cells24,25,26. Briefly, PBMCs were thawed in RF10 supplemented with 2 µg/ml deoxyribonuclease I (DNase; Sigma-Aldrich) and washed in serum-free RPMI. One third of PBMCs were pulsed for 1 h with IBV peptide pools (7 peptide pools ranging between 8 and 22 peptides per pool; Supplementary Table 1) in serum-free RPMI at 10 µM at 37*C. Pulsed cells were washed twice with serum-free RPMI, resuspended in RF10 and mixed with the remaining autologous PBMCs (also resuspended in RF10). Cultures were incubated at 37 °C/5% CO2 for 10–12 days. IL-2 (Roche Diagnostics) was added on day 4 to a final concentration of 20 U/ml.Restimulation and intracellular cytokine staining of CD8+ T cellsExpanded IBV-specific CD8+ T cells were harvested on day 10 and restimulated with the cognate peptide pool or PMA/Ionomycin and DMSO as controls for 5 h in the presence of Brefeldin A (Golgi Plug, BD), Monensin (Golgi Stop, BD) and anti-CD107a-FITC (1:200, Invitrogen #53-1079-42) at 37 °C/5% CO2. After restimulation, cells were surface stained on ice for 30 min with Live/Dead near infrared (NIR) (1:800, Invitrogen #L34976), anti-CD8-PerCP-Cy5.5 (1:00, BD Pharmingen #565310), anti-CD4-PE (1:50, BD Pharmingen #555347) or anti-CD4-BV650 (1:200, BD Horizon #563875) and anti-CD3-PE-Cy7 (1:50, BD Pharmingen #563423), fixed and permeabilised with BD Cytofix/cytoperm and intracellularly stained on ice for 30 min with anti-IFN-γ-V450 (1:100, BD Pharmingen #560371), anti-MIP-1β-APC (1:40, BD Pharmingen #560686) or anti-MIP-1β-PE (1:50, BD Pharmingen #550078), anti-TNFα-AF700 (1:50, BD Pharmingen #557996), acquired on a LSRII Fortessa (BD Biosciences) and subsequently analyzed with FlowJo v10.8.1 (FlowJo, LLC). On day (d) 11 or d12, expanded cell populations responding to immunogenic peptide pools were harvested and restimulated for 5 h with either individual IBV peptides at 10 µM, the peptide pool, PMA/Ionomycin or DMSO and subsequently stained as described above. Antigen-specific CD8+ T cells expanded for 11-12 days with pools consisting of immunogenic peptides only (Supplementary Table 3) were restimulated for 5 h with C1R.B*07:01, C1R.B*08:01, C1R.B*35:01s or parental C1Rs pulsed with IBV peptides at 10 µM in the presence of Brefeldin A (BD Golgi Plug), Monensin (BD Golgi Stop) and anti-CD107a FITC (Invitrogen) at 37 °C/5% CO2 and stained as above.Conservation Influenza B virus-derived peptidesConservation of IBV peptides was performed as described25,84. Briefly, 16,645 full-length HA (1940 to 9 September 2022), 11,111 full-length NP (1940 to 26 November 2021) and 12,987 full-length NS1 (1940 to 23 March 2023) amino acid (aa) sequences from human isolates were downloaded from the influenza virus resource database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information database (NCBI; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/FLU), accession numbers can be found in Supplementary Data 2. Sequences with large deletions were excluded (Bioedit v7.2.5) from further analysis. Overall 11 HA, 10 NP and 2 NS1 aa sequences were omitted. Conservation of each aa residue of the relevant peptides was established using UGENE v40.1 (http://ugene.unipro.ru/, Unipro). The overall conservation of the peptide sequence was calculated as the average conservation of the combined aa positions in the peptide.HLA/peptide tetramer staining of expanded IBV-specific CD8+ T cell linespHLA class-I (pHLA-I) tetramers were generated by refolding each peptide with its restricted HLA α-heavy chain-BirA and β2-microglobulin53,85,86 before 8:1 conjugation with PE- or APC-streptavidin (BD, cat #554061 and #554067 respectively) to generate tetramers; B7/NP30, B7/NS1196, B8/NP30, B8/NP92, B8/NP479, B35/HA231 and B35/NS1260. To test newly generated tetramers, 0.2–0.4 × 106 frozen IBV pool-specific CD8+ T cells were thawed in RF10 supplemented with 2 µg/ml DNAse. Cells were incubated with anti-human FcR block (Miltenyi Biotec) for 15 min and stained with tetramer at room temperature for 1 h before surface staining on ice for 30 min with anti-CD3-BV510 (1:200, BioLegend #317332), anti-CD4-BV650 (1:200, BD Horizon #563875), Live/Dead NIR (1:800, Invitrogen #L34976) and anti-CD8-PerCP-Cy5.5 (1:50, BD Pharmingen #565310). Cells were then fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde (PFA) (Electron Microscopy Sciences) for 20 min on ice, acquired on an LSRII Fortessa and analyzed with FlowJo v10.8.1.Ex vivo tetramer associated magnetic enrichment (TAME) of epitope-specific CD8+ T cellsPBMCs, spleen, lymph nodes or tonsils (10–50 × 106) were thawed in RF10 supplemented with 2 µg/ml DNAse or 50U/ml Benzonase (Novagen Merck). Spleen samples were passed through LS columns after thawing to prevent contamination with red pulp, as described87. Tetramer-specific CD8+ T cells were enriched using magnetic separation32. Briefly, cells were stained with the B7/NP30, B7/NS1196, B8/NP30, B8/NP92, B8/NP479, B35/HA231 or B35/NS1260 tetramers at room temperature for 1 h in MACS buffer (PBS with 0.5% BSA and 2 mM EDTA) and incubated with anti-PE and/or anti-APC microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec) followed by magnetic separation. PBMC samples were then stained with anti-CD71-BV421 (1:50, BD Horizon #562995), anti-CD3-BV510 (1:200, BioLegend #317332), anti-HLA-DR-BV605 (1:100, BioLegend #307640), anti-CD4-BV650 (1:200, BD Horizon #563875), anti-CD27-BV711 (1:200, BD Horizon #563167), anti-CD38-BV786 (1:100, BD Horizon #563964), anti-CCR7-AF700 (1:50, BD Pharmingen #561143), anti-CD14-APC-H7 (1:100, BD Pharmingen #560180), anti-CD19-APC-H (1:100, BD Pharmingen #560177 or #560252), anti-Live/Dead NIR (1:800, Invitrogen #L34976), anti-CD45RA-FITC (1:200, BD Pharmingen #555488), anti-CD8-PerCP-Cy5.5 (1:50, BD Pharmingen #565310), anti-CD95-PE-CF594 (1:100, BD Horizon #562395) and anti-PD-1-PE-Cy7 (1:50, BD Pharmingen #561272). Tissue samples were stained with the panel above including anti-CD103-BUV395 (1:50, BD Horizon #564346) and anti-CD69-BV421 (BioLegend #310930). Cells were either resuspended in MACS for single cell index sorting using the FACSAriaIII (BD) or fixed with 1% PFA before acquiring on an LSRII Fortessa and subsequently analyzed with FlowJo v10.8.1.Tetramer staining within human lungsLung samples (7–20 × 106 cells) were thawed, resuspended in MACS buffer and run through a 100 µm filter followed by a 30 µm filter. Samples were incubated with anti-human FcR block for 15 min, stained with pMHC-I for 1 h at room temperature, surface stained with the tissue TAME panel on ice for 30 min and fixed in 1% PFA on ice for 20 min. Samples were acquired on an LSRII Fortessa and analyzed with FlowJo v10.8.1 (FlowJo, LLC).Single-cell multiplex paired TCRαβ sequencingEnriched tetramer+ CD8+ T cells were single cell index sorted into chilled 96 well twin.tec PCR plates (Eppendorf) and immediately stored at −80 °C. Multiplex-nested RT-PCR of paired CDR3α and CDR3β regions was performed as described32,88. Primers used can be found in Supplementary Table 10. Sequences were analyzed with FinchTV. V-J regions were identified with IMGT (www.imgt.org/IMGT_vquest). The TCRdist analytical pipeline89 was used to parse TCR sequences. Clonotypes were defined as single-cell TCRαβ pairs that exhibit the same V, J and CDR3 regions. The motifs are computed by the TCRdist algorithm and are reflective of CDR3 sequences of variable lengths. Circos plots were generated with the circlize package90 in R v4.1.3 (The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)).CDR3αβ motif analysisTCRdist88 was used to identify CDR3 motifs. In brief, TCRdist performs a statistical analysis of overrepresented CDR3 sequence motifs, and takes in account the underlying sequence biases introduced by the rearrangement process. Furthermore, TCRdist uses a recursive search algorithm to identify sequence patterns that occur significantly more often in the observed receptors than in two V and J gene matched background sets of receptor sequences.Protein production and purificationPeptides used in this study were >85% pure and purchased from GenScript. Human β2m micro-globulin and HLA-B*07:02, B*08:01 and B*35:01 heavy chains with C-terminal Bir-A tag were expressed as inclusion bodies in E.coli BL21 (DE3). The HLAs were refolded and purified as described91. Briefly, ~60 mg of HLA-B*07:02BirA, -B*08:01BirA and -B*35:01BirA heavy chain, 20 mg of human β2m and 6 mg of peptide (Table 1) incubated in refolding buffer containing 3 M urea, 100Mm Tris (pH-8.0), 400 mM Arginine, 2 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM PMSF, one protease inhibitor tablet (Roche), and 0.5 mM oxidized and 5 mM reduced Glutathione. The refolded HLAs-peptide complex was purified from DEAE anion exchange and Size exclusion chromatography. HLA-B*07:02BirA, HLA-B*0801BirA and B*35:01BirA refolded with different peptides are biotinylated with Bir-A ligase which was further used for tetramer staining.Crystallization, data collection and structure determinationCrystals for HLA-B*07:02-NS1196-206 (HPNGYKSLSTL) and HLA-B*07:02-NP30-38 (RPIIRPATL) binary complex were crystallized using vapor diffusion method at 20 °C in 1:1 drop ratio of protein and reservoir. The binary complex crystals of B702NS196-206 were obtained at 20 mg/ml protein concentration using mother liquor 0.2 M Sodium sulfate, 20 %w/v PEG 3350. While crystals for B*07:02-NP30-38 were grown at 15 mg/ml protein concentration using mother liquor 0.2 M NH4NO3, 20 %w/v PEG 3350. Crystals of both binary complexes were gradually transferred into mother liquor supplemented with 20% Ethylene Glycol and subsequently flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Crystals were diffracted at MX-1 and MX-2 beamlines of Australian Synchrotron at Dectris Eiger detector respectively. Data were processed using XDS92 and Aimless from the CCP4 program suite93. The structures were solved via molecular replacement in Phaser94 and structure models were built via iterative rounds of model building in Coot95 and restrained refinement in Phenix96. Structural overlays of HLA-B*08:01 and HLA-B*35:01 onto the epitope conformation of HLA-B*07:02-NP30-38 were created using previously determined versions of these MHC platforms. Structures were deposited at www.rcsb.org with codes 8TUH and 8TUB.Statistical analysisStatistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism v9.5.1 (GraphPad). Statistical significance was determined using Kruskal–Wallis test with Dunn’s correction for multiple tests. For paired spleen and lymph node samples, Wilcoxon tests with no correction for multiple comparisons were used. Differences were considered significant at p value < 0.05. No statistical methods were used to pre-determine sample sizes but our sample sizes were similar those reported in previous publications. Experiments were not randomized and Investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment. Samples with <10 tetramer+ T cells counted were excluded for phenotypic analyses.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.

By fitting a model simulating H9N2 AIV transmission to data from a field experiment, we characterise the epidemiology of the virus in a live bird market in Bangladesh. Many supplied birds arrive already exposed to H9N2 AIVs, resulting in many broiler chickens entering the market as infected, and many indigenous backyard chickens entering with pre-existing immunity. Most susceptible chickens become infected within one day spent at the market, owing to high levels of viral transmission within market and short latent periods, as brief as 5.3 hours. Although H9N2 AIV transmission can be substantially reduced under moderate levels of cleaning and disinfection, effective risk mitigation also requires a range of additional interventions targeting markets and other nodes along the poultry production and distribution network.

Despite being classified as a low pathogenic virus, H9N2 AIV is responsible for substantial economic loss for the poultry industry2,3. Infection is typically associated with moderate to severe respiratory symptoms, delayed growth, reduced egg production and increased mortality, especially when co-infection with other pathogens is involved4. Some H9N2 AIV lineages are known to be zoonotic, with resulting symptoms being typically mild. Co-circulation with other AIV subtypes may lead to the emergence of reassortant viruses with increased pathogenicity and/or zoonotic potential5,6,7. H9N2 appears to be involved in the origin of several novel zoonotic AIVs, whose number has been rapidly increasing since 20138. AIVs with H9N2-derived genes include H7N99, H5N1, H10N810,11,12 and, more recently, H3N813.In many Asian countries, the prevalence of H9N2 AIVs is particularly high in live bird markets (LBMs), with estimates in Bangladeshi markets as high as 80%14,15. LBMs play a central role in the marketing of poultry in developing countries, being the place of choice for many people to purchase meat for consumption. At the same time, the high prevalence of AIV infection among traded poultry is concerning due to the risk of zoonotic spillover to humans5,16,17. In LBMs, the latter may be exposed to AIV through contaminated dust particles, water, surfaces and the slaughtering of infected birds. LBMs are also known to promote the mixing and evolution of AIVs, in that they enable the intermingling of multiple poultry species from many distant locations and diverse farming systems18,19,20. Over the last 25 years, public health concerns around LBMs have prompted health authorities in several Asian countries to take steps to control AIV transmission in these settings; adopted measures included enhanced hygiene protocols, bans on overnight poultry storage, as well as periodic rest days21,22,23,24,25,26. Temporary and permanent market shutdowns have also been employed in response to outbreaks of emerging zoonotic AIVs27.The central role played by LBMs in disseminating AIVs, including H9N2 viruses, calls for a better understanding of AIV transmission dynamics in these settings, which is paramount to design and implement effective and appropriate interventions. Previous field research focused on specific epidemiological aspects of AIV transmission, e.g. contamination in the environment28,29,30,31, or involved cross-sectional investigations of AIV circulation in LBMs15. Unfortunately, linking results from these studies to viral dynamics is not straightforward. Challenge and transmission experiments in which live virus is inoculated artificially into chickens, and eventually transmitted onwards15,32, allow us to estimate important properties of AIV epidemiology. However, because these experiments are conducted within a controlled environment, it remains difficult to draw general conclusions about AIV transmission in LBMs.Here we aimed to fill these gaps by modelling H9N2 AIV transmission in an LBM. Mathematical modelling has proven useful to study AIV transmission dynamics in LBMs, but such investigations have been mostly theoretical so far22. Our work is instead grounded on a longitudinal dataset of H9N2 AIV acquisition in exotic and indigenous chickens in an LBM in Chattogram, Bangladesh33. Using Bayesian methods, we estimated quantities of epidemiological relevance, including H9N2 AIV transmission rate, host-specific latent periods, and quantified within-market prevalence as well as the likelihood of prior chicken exposure to H9N2 before entering the LBM. Finally, we leveraged these results to assess the impact of a range of hypothetical veterinary public health interventions on H9N2 AIV transmission.ResultsParameter inferenceOur model simulated the transmission of avian influenza viruses (AIVs) among chickens in an LBM in Chattogram, Bangladesh. There, a fast turnover of poultry (Supplementary Fig. 1A) drew together a steady supply of susceptible animals and unsold chickens offered for sale in previous days, thus creating opportunities for the amplification of AIVs.Following our experimental design, explained in detail in ref. 33, we focused on exotic broiler (BR) and local, backyard-raised (BY) chicken types, which represent a large share of chickens traded daily in the LBM (Supplementary Fig. 1B). We further distinguished between chickens traded along conventional (control, c) and altered (intervention, i) marketing channels. The latter involved purchasing chickens from farms rather than from traders at the market, thus avoiding intermediate transport and storage steps. We assumed these chickens could differ in terms of prior exposure to AIVs, possibly due to our intervention, which consisted in applying strict biosecurity measures during the collection and transport of farm-acquired chickens before introducing them to the LBM. Control chickens, instead, were recruited from market vendors among those recently supplied by mobile traders.We fitted our model to H9N2 Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positivity data33. We considered samples with a cycle threshold (Ct) <40 as positive, in accordance with the laboratory protocols of the Australian Animal Health Laboratory (Geelong, Australia, http://www.csiro.au/places/AAHL). A more conservative criterion for positivity (Ct < 33) was also considered throughout the analysis. We obtained posterior estimates and credible intervals (C.I.) for thirteen parameters listed in Table 1; these include H9N2 AIV transmissibility β, latent periods TE,b for types b = BR and BY (panels Fig. 1A–C, respectively) and probabilities of prior exposure ρg,b for different combinations of chicken type and recruitment group g = c, i. A description of prior distributions for each fitted parameter can be found in Supplementary Table 1, while posterior marginal distributions and pairwise plots are shown in Supplementary Fig. 2. Goodness of fit was checked through posterior predictive checks (Supplementary Fig. 3).Table 1 Fitted parametersFull size tableFig. 1: Model fit results.Posterior distributions for β (A), TE,BR (B), and TE,BY (C) obtained from fits to Ct = 40 (coral) and Ct = 33 (teal) data. D Average posterior probability of a chicken remaining susceptible after a given amount of time spent at the market and 95% C.I. (shaded area). E, F Average proportions of exotic broiler and backyard chickens in either control (solid) or intervention (dashed) groups entering the market as latent or infectious (E + I) or recovered (R). 95% C.I. are denoted with black lines. For both fits we set prior hyper-parameters lβ = 0.005 and \({\bar{T}}_{EI}=5\) days (see Supplementary Methods). Results in (D) are based on 30000 simulations based on 3000 samples from the posterior, each simulation tracking 106 experimental chickens; all other panels are based on 8360 posterior samples, obtained after discarding the first 10000 MCMC iterations and keeping one sample every 1000th iteration.Full size imageFrom our model’s output, we found a shorter latent period in exotic broiler compared to backyard chickens (Fig. 1B, C), lasting an average of 5.3 h for exotic broiler, and 1 day for backyard chickens. With a more conservative criterion for positivity (Ct < 33 instead of Ct < 40), these estimates increased to 6.1 h and 1.3 days. In these exercises we assume that infected chickens would test positive only from the point where they start shedding, i.e. since the onset of infectiousness. We also found remarkably high levels of transmission in the LBM, which translated into more than 80% of chickens entering the market as susceptible, becoming infected within 20 h, regardless of whether we set the threshold for positivity to Ct = 40 or Ct = 33 (Fig. 1D). However, we estimated higher transmission under Ct = 40, where more than 80% of poultry became infected within 10 h, in contrast to nearly 55% for Ct = 33. This was likely due to the fact that the latter threshold corresponds to less positive samples in the data with respect to Ct = 40.We also obtained posterior estimates for the proportions of chickens that were already infected (i.e. latent or infectious, E+I) or immune to H9N2 (R) at recruitment, for any combination of chicken type and recruitment group (Fig. 1E, F, show exotic broilers and backyard chickens, respectively). Interestingly, we found different patterns across chicken types: in the case of exotic broilers, most chickens with prior exposure to H9N2 were either infectious or latent, with only a minor proportion of them being immune (Fig. 1E). In contrast, most previously exposed backyard chickens were immune to H9N2 (Fig. 1F). Our results thus suggest that prior infection occurs close to marketing age for broilers, whereas in backyard chickens it may occur further in the past (see Supplementary Fig. 4 for distributions of time since exposure). These findings are consistent with known rearing practices and ages at sale of each chicken type: broilers are selectively bred to grow rapidly, and are sold for meat after just 28–31 days after hatching17. Backyard chickens are instead raised for meat and eggs in rural households and can reach much older ages. For context, backyard chickens in our dataset were aged between 90 and 720 days.We also found differences between control and intervention chickens already at recruitment. In the broiler case, intervention chickens were less likely to be already exposed at recruitment compared to their control counterparts (odds ratio 0.44–0.58, depending on Ct, see Fig. 1E). However, the reverse was the case in backyard chickens, with a larger proportion of intervention chickens being already exposed to H9N2 compared to controls (odds ratio 2.37–2.13, depending on Ct).The relative importance of external introductions of infected chickens and local transmission is assessed in Supplementary Fig. 5. We find comparable proportions of LBM-acquired infections caused by chickens infected before and after entering the LBM. Moreover, we estimate that within-LBM transmission is high enough (R0 = 3.7−4.9 depending on Ct threshold) to ensure long-term persistence of H9N2 AIV within the LBM in the absence of further external introductions (Supplementary Fig. 6).Our results, in particular posterior estimates of latent periods and probability of prior exposure, are robust to prior assumptions on transmissibility β and time to viral clearance–i.e. the sum of infectious and latent periods–(Supplementary Figs. 7 and 8). Finally, our inferential procedure was able to recover model parameters in the context of synthetic data simulated from the same generative process used for inference (Supplementary Fig. 9). In particular, we show that inference succeeds in a range of scenarios where model parameters differ across chicken types and recruitment groups and in the presence of moderately biased prior assumptions about shedding time.Modelling interventionsIn the last 20 years, LBMs have often been the target of veterinary public health interventions aiming to mitigate AIV transmission. Yet, the effectiveness of individual measures is difficult to assess and are likely to vary between different social, economic and political contexts. Here, we leveraged our inferential results to evaluate the impact of various potential control measures to reduce H9N2 transmission in an LBM. In doing so, we considered different modes of transmission, namely direct and mediated by environmental contamination, and assessed the sensitivity of our results to each assumption. With environmentally-driven transmission, the force of infection was assumed to be proportional to environmental contamination Ienv(t); Ienv(t) accumulates due to shedding from infectious chickens and decays progressively at rate Θ. We did not attempt to fit this model to data; rather, we mapped each value of “direct” transmissibility β from previous posterior samples into an appropriate value of environmental transmissibility (βenv) yielding similar prevalence levels. The exact mapping, suggested by22 and derived in the “Materials and Methods” section, is:$$\beta \longrightarrow {\beta }_{env}=\beta \cdot (1-{e}^{-\Theta }).$$ (1) Note that this relation depends on the decay rate Θ and that a slower decay corresponds to a smaller βenv, which compensates for the longer persistence in the environment. Here we consider three values of Θ, namely Θ−1 = 10, 3, 1days, corresponding to slow, intermediate and fast decay, respectively. These values are based on actual estimates from the scientific literature and capture a broad range of environmental conditions (see Supplementary Methods). Within LBMs, the infection can be transmitted through poultry drinking water, as well as cages and floors that are contaminated by faecal material and during slaughtering. The lack of disinfection and the constant moving of cages and birds further promote poultry exposure to environmental contamination. Supplementary Fig. 10 shows a numerical validation of the mapping expressed in Eq. (1).To start with, we implemented three measures based on either (i) early removal/culling of unsold chickens, (ii) control of chickens entering the market or (iii) preemptive immunisation through vaccination. Figure 2 displays the effectiveness of various interventions, computed as the reduction in cumulative daily prevalence relative to a baseline scenario with no intervention (See Supplementary Figs. 11 and 12 for prevalence dynamics over a single day). The green and yellow bars correspond to direct and environmental transmission, respectively. In the latter case, we present a single value of Θ, but our results are independent of this choice. Estimates of intervention effectiveness presented in Fig. 2 are robust to mismatches between inferred and original parameters in simulated scenarios (Supplementary Fig. 13).Fig. 2: Effectiveness of intervention measures.Results for early removal/culling of unsold chickens (A, D), control of chickens entering the market (B, E) and preemptive immunisation through vaccination (C, F). Bars represent a mean reduction in average, cumulative daily prevalence with respect to a baseline scenario with no intervention, based on 5000 simulations from 500 posterior samples. The yellow and green bars correspond to direct and environmental transmission, respectively. In the latter case, we set Θ−1 = 3 days for the sake of visualisation. In (B, E), solid and hatched bars correspond to a maximum length of stay of 5 (baseline) and 1 days, respectively. The first and second rows are based on posterior distributions obtained from fits to Ct = 40 and Ct = 33 data, respectively.Full size imageIn (i), unsold chickens are automatically removed from the market if still unsold after a time Tm. Figure 2 shows that (i) is not effective at reducing prevalence (A, D), unless chickens are removed after 1 day or less. Indeed, high levels of transmission, combined with a short latent period in broilers (Fig. 1B), lead to a rapid build-up of infectious chickens well before Tm. This result holds, both qualitatively and quantitatively, regardless of whether we consider direct (green) or environmental (yellow) transmission.Intervention (ii) aims at reducing the proportion of exposed chickens entering the market, either as the result of control measures acting upstream, e.g. by enhancing farmers’ and traders’ compliance with biosecurity practices. In practice, we implement (ii) by reducing the proportion of previously exposed chickens from ρc,b to (1 − r)ρc,b, where r represents the intervention’s strength. Figure 2B, E reveal that a reduction in ρc,b by a factor r = 0.9 alone (filled bars) is not sufficient to lower transmission significantly. Indeed, latent & infectious chickens arriving at the LBM, albeit fewer compared to baseline, are still able to sustain high levels of transmission. The effectiveness of (ii) is even smaller in the presence of environmental transmission due to AIV persistence in the environment, which is not directly affected by the intervention. However, a combined control strategy involving both (i) and (ii) proves superior to individual measures (hatched bars). Notably, the benefits of combining (i) and (ii) exceed expectations under the assumption that their effects were additive or multiplicative, hence suggesting a synergistic effect of multiple interventions (Supplementary Fig. 14).With intervention (iii) a proportion p of chickens are immunised through vaccination, and are assumed to be completely protected from AIV infection. This measure not only reduces the number of chickens entering the market while infectious or latent, but also reduces overall susceptibility to AIV in the flock. Figure 2C, F show that preemptive vaccination is particularly effective at reducing transmission; in particular, the reduction arising from vaccinating just 20% of all chickens is comparable to that of the most stringent implementations of interventions (i) or (ii).The inclusion of environmental transmission in our model allowed us to explore the impact of sanitation, which is often adopted in the context of LBMs. Daily, weekly, or even monthly cleaning of poultry stalls, with or without weekly disinfection, was found to be associated with lower detection of AIV environmental contamination30. However, sanitation is not straightforward to implement in practice34,35. Here, sanitation is assumed to reduce environmental contamination by a factor δ. First, we note that while direct and environmental transmission were shown to yield similar stationary dynamics (Supplementary Fig. 10) and sensitivity to interventions (i) to (iii) (Fig. 2), significant dynamical differences arose in the presence of sanitation. Specifically, Fig. 3A shows that after depopulating and disinfecting the LBM, baseline prevalence levels were recovered rapidly under direct transmission, but not under environmental transmission. The mechanistic reason lies in the “inertia” inherent to the environmental reservoir, relative to an equivalent model with direct transmission. This inertia is expressed by the apparent trade-off between environmental transmissibility βenv and persistence in the environment, as quantified by Θ. We stress that while this effect follows from Eq. (1), it is not an artefact: βenv and Θ should be expected to behave in this way, with, e.g., longer persistence in the environment (smaller Θ) corresponding to slower relaxation. This is indeed confirmed by Fig. 3B, C, where we compare three values of Θ and use Ct = 40 and Ct = 33 posterior samples, respectively. At low Θ, the typical relaxation time is at least 15 days and increases rapidly with disinfection δ. As Θ increases, the relaxation time becomes shorter and less dependent on the disinfection rate.Fig. 3: Effectiveness of market depopulation and disinfection under direct vs environmental transmission.A Cumulative daily prevalence, expressed as a fraction of its stationary value, after depopulating and fully disinfecting (δ = 1) the LBM, under direct (yellow) and environmental (green) transmission. In the latter case, we set Θ−1 = 3 days. B, C Average relaxation time as a function of disinfection δ, based on Ct = 40 and Ct = 33 posterior distributions. Light to dark lines correspond to Θ−1 = 10, 3, 1 days, respectively. Relaxation time is defined as the time at which cumulative daily prevalence crosses a given threshold value for the first time since LBM depopulation. Here, this threshold is set to a fraction (0.95) of the expected cumulative daily prevalence in the pre-intervention period. We compute 500 relaxation times from as many posterior samples, using 10 independent simulations to estimate mean cumulative daily prevalence. D–G Cumulative daily prevalence under various combinations of reduced length of stay (from left to right), reduced probability of prior exposure (from left to right) and disinfection, on the x-axis, for varying rates of environmental decay. Prevalence is calculated relative to a scenario with no interventions and the same Θ. Results corresponding to solid and dashed lines are based on samples from Ct = 40 and Ct = 33 posterior distributions, respectively.Full size imageConsistently with Fig. 3A–C, we found increasing returns from routinely (daily) disinfecting the market when Θ is small, even if disinfection is not perfect (Fig. 3D–G). A multi-pronged approach featuring interventions (i) and (ii) and small levels of disinfection, say δ = 0.3, is able to curb cumulative daily prevalence by more than 80% for any explored value of Θ and in both parameter configurations (Fig. 3G). Preventing 90% of prior infections (Fig. 3E) proved more effective than just limiting maximum length of stay to 1 day (Fig. 3F) when coupled with routine disinfection, but not in the absence of it (i.e. δ = 0).DiscussionIn this work, we characterised H9N2 transmission patterns in a single LBM in Bangladesh by fitting a mechanistic transmission model to a longitudinal dataset collected in the context of a field experiment.Our results confirm the important role of LBMs as hotspots of AIV transmission. We found a high prevalence of H9N2 AIV, in agreement with previous studies and LBM surveillance in Bangladesh15,16. Our simulations further suggest that H9N2 AIV prevalence varies considerably during a single day due to high transmission rates. Such an effect has been illustrated in previous modelling work22, and should be accounted for by AIV surveillance initiatives and in the design of chicken sampling strategies in general. From a systemic perspective, the high persistence and prevalence of H9N2 AIV in LBMs are concerning for the whole poultry production and distribution infrastructure in which LBMs are embedded. Although our analysis is based on data collected from a single LBM, our results are relevant to LBMs with similar features. Indeed, vendors operating in the same types of markets and locations are expected to adopt similar practices20,25 and source chickens from overlapping catchment areas20.The fast turnover of susceptible chickens in LBMs is concerning since it is likely to promote amplification of AIV subtypes with short latency other than H9N2, e.g. H5N1 AIV32. This virus is routinely detected in Bangladeshi wholesale markets, albeit at a lower frequency compared to H9N2 AIV14. This likely reflects the lower abundance of traded backyard ducks, which act as the primary source of H5N1 infections in markets15,36.We estimated an average latent period of 5.3–6 h and 1–1.3 days, depending on the Ct threshold, for exotic broiler and backyard chickens, respectively. Short latent times in exotic broiler chickens are compatible with a fast onset of viral shedding, already after one-day post-inoculation, as observed in laboratory experiments32,37,38,39,40,41,42,43. Moreover, we believe that our experimental design, which includes inter-sampling periods as short as 12 h, is more suitable to resolve short latent periods than many laboratory experiments, which typically collect the first samples post-inoculation only after 1 day. Our estimates were robust with respect to prior assumptions about the duration of shedding, as shown in sensitivity analyses. Unfortunately, we could not reliably estimate the infectious period since our data did not include enough information about viral clearance.Inferred proportions of chickens that were recruited directly in farms (intervention group) and that had already been exposed to H9N2 AIV prior to T0 revealed substantial differences between broiler and backyard chickens. Specifically, we found most exposed broilers to be actively infected at recruitment, with little evidence of accrued immunity. In contrast, the majority of backyard chickens were estimated to be already immune to H9N2 AIV at recruitment. A recent study found 1% and 15.7% H9N2 AIV antibody prevalence and low viral prevalence, 0.2% and 0.5%, in broiler and backyard farms around Chattogram, respectively44. These prevalence values are slightly lower than estimates reported from active surveillance, which found 2.2% and 9.6% of AIV RT-PCR positivity in backyards and farms, respectively, with around a fourth of positive samples attributable to H9N2 AIV14. At the flock level, H9N2 AIV prevalence around Chattogram has been estimated at around 0.7% and 1.9% for backyard and broiler chickens, respectively. Another cross-sectional study of household chickens performed in the same area found a household-level prevalence of H9N2 AIV of 3.2% 45.In absolute terms, our estimates of H9N2 AIV circulation in broilers sampled at T0 are larger than previous estimates of viral circulation in farms. In fact, crude numbers of broiler chickens recruited in farms that tested positive for H9N2 AIV at T0 (5 out of 110), suggest higher viral prevalence than found by other cross-sectional studies. Analogously, we estimated a higher proportion of past infections in backyard chickens at T0 than suggested by serological evidence. While the reasons for these discrepancies remain unknown, we note that chickens included in this study were collected towards the end of a production cycle, when they might be exposed to an increased risk of AIV infection. Nonetheless, our results remain in broad qualitative agreement with available evidence as both suggest a higher prevalence of antibodies against H9N2 AIV in backyards compared to broiler farms, in the face of larger viral circulation in broilers.Exotic broilers recruited at farm gates were found to be less likely to be already exposed to H9N2 AIV compared to chickens recruited at LBM gates (control group), suggesting some degree of viral amplification happening along channels connecting farms to markets15,20. However, we found the opposite relation in the case of backyard chickens. One possible explanation is that backyard farmers included in this study saw an opportunity to sell chickens that were already sick, potentially due to AIV infection. Selling sick birds is not an uncommon practice among backyard farmers near Chattogram, who often operate in a world of compromises46.High levels of H9N2 AIV circulation in LBMs are concerning from a veterinary public health standpoint, and may require considerable efforts and resources to be controlled effectively. Indeed, some of our simulated interventions, like reduced length of stay and reduced probability of prior exposure, proved to be only modestly effective. Combining both interventions proved considerably more effective at reducing transmission compared to individual measures. Bans on overnight stays in Hong Kong were estimated to reduce H9N2 AIV isolation rates by more than 80%23. It is possible that the combination of high introduction levels and baseline within-market transmission is larger in our study, thus requiring increased efforts to reduce transmission by an amount similar to what had been observed in Hong Kong.Preemptive vaccination alone proved to be particularly effective in simulations, under the assumption of complete sterilising immunity. A vaccine against H9N2 AIV is already available in Bangladesh, but its use has been limited to breeders and layers47. Widespread H9N2 AIV vaccination has been implemented in China and Korea. In Korea, the genetic diversity of H9N2 AIV decreased suddenly after implementing vaccination in 200748. Large-scale AIV vaccination stamped out H7N9 in Chinese LBMs49 but not H9N2, likely due to vaccine failure50. Indeed, continued AIV evolution can jeopardise vaccination efforts, requiring effective viral surveillance to inform vaccine composition and timely roll-out of updated vaccines.We considered two alternative modes of transmission, direct and mediated by the environment. Both scenarios were able to explain observed dynamic patterns and yielded similar results in the context of interventions targeting chickens only. Previous theoretical work indeed demonstrated that both modes of transmission lead to similar dynamical outcomes, especially when environmental contamination unfolds on a fast time scale, and that it may be difficult to prefer one or another based solely on prevalence or incidence data51,52. This is a reassuring finding as it suggests that some epidemiological conclusions are not affected by precise modelling assumptions. However, further work is needed to identify dynamical signatures of direct and environmental transmission. Nonetheless, incorporating environmental transmission is necessary if the objective is to assess the impact of LBM depopulation and routine cleaning/disinfection, as done in this work. In this case, moderate levels of cleaning were able to curb transmission significantly in simulations, especially with small decay rates, as that corresponds to a slower accumulation of contaminated material. Periodic cleaning/disinfection, usually carried out during rest days, has been shown to reduce the AIV burden in Chinese, Hong Kong, and Bangladeshi LBMs22,30,53. Including environmental transmission may also be more appropriate to capture differences in the prevalence of contamination across LBM sections (e.g. stalls and slaughter areas)15, and assess how the distance from slaughter areas affects the risk of contamination. Practical difficulties in successfully implementing sanitation in LBMs35 further underscore the importance of adopting a multi-pronged approach to reduce the burden of H9N2 AIV in LBMs. Our study also makes the case for the vaccination of poultry intended to be sold in LBMs in Bangladesh.Our study has several limitations. It focused on exotic broiler and backyard chickens, i.e. the same chicken types sampled in the field experiment. We did not include other chicken types, quails or ducks that are traded at the same market, as it would have been difficult to estimate additional parameters in the absence of appropriate data. While this could potentially bias our estimate of AIV transmissibility, which appears to be sensitive to other prior assumptions as well, we believe that our main results, e.g. estimated prevalence, are not affected by these simplifying study conditions. We did not consider seasonal variation in AIV transmission over the study period54. Nonetheless, explored contamination decay rate values can be sensibly mapped to environmental conditions at different times of the year.We assumed that PCR tests could not detect infections during the latent phase, i.e. in absence of viral shedding, but were otherwise perfectly sensitive in the case of infectious and recently recovered chickens. High rates of positivity to H9N2 AIV suggest however that test sensitivity should not be a problem in our analysis. We also believe that positive outcomes were unlikely to arise from cross-reactivity induced by other AIVs, but we can not exclude cross-contamination of some samples in the laboratory. We note that immune cross-reactions between distinct AIVs may still affect susceptibility to H9N2 AIV. In addition, it has been proposed that backyard chickens are intrinsically more resistant to AIV infection compared to exotic broilers55,56,57,58, which could partially explain differences in attack rates between them. Our results indicate, however, that differences in earlier exposure to H9N2 AIV are sufficient to explain observed incidence patterns, and are consistent with known ages at sale and levels of H9 seropositivity in broilers and backyard chickens44. A better understanding of the effectiveness of prior immunity, which we have assumed to be sterilising, will help validating or confuting this interpretation.In conclusion, we found that H9N2 AIV is transmitted rapidly among chickens in an LBM in Chattogram, Bangladesh. A short latent period, especially in broilers, high transmission rates and a continuous daily supply of susceptible chickens provide fertile grounds for H9N2 AIV amplification despite the short length of stay. Virus persistence in LBMs is further promoted by poor cleaning, which enables viral accumulation in the environment, and frequent introductions of infectious chickens from trade. Consequently, sustained efforts involving a diverse range of veterinary public health interventions will be required to curb the circulation of this virus. The ubiquity of similar poultry handling and trading practices suggests that our findings apply to other Bangladeshi LBMs as well. Applications of the model to other LBMs may require calibrating specific LBM features such as the number of chickens being traded and their length of stay. Applications to other AIV strains, e.g. H5N1, will also require accounting for the presence in the LBM of relevant hosts species (e.g. waterfowl in the case of H5N1 AIV), their specific infection parameters and differential ability to survive in the environment59. Finally, we note that our modelling framework could be applied to disentangle the contributions of external introductions and local transmission in other types of live animal markets and host-pathogen systems.MethodsModel descriptionWe use a SEEIRR model to simulate disease dynamics. This model is a variant of the more common SEIR model, which is typically used to investigate AIV dynamics60. Under the assumptions of density-dependent transmission and homogeneous mixing, susceptible (S) chickens become infected at rate Λ(t) = βI(t)/N, where β is the transmission rate, I(t) counts the number of infectious (I) chickens at time t and N is the number of new chickens entering the market daily. Exposed (E) chickens turn infectious after an average latent period TE = σ−1 and recover after an average infectious period TI = μ−1. The exposed state consists of two consecutive stages (E1,2) with the same exit rate 2σ, yielding a gamma-distributed latent period. This is often regarded as a more realistic assumption than an exponential distribution of durations, which is implicit in models with single-staged compartments32. On the other hand, including a single infectious compartment should not affect our results significantly since the main limitation to transmission within LBMs comes from the short length of stay. Recovered chickens initially enter the R+ state and then advance to R− at rate η. In this work, we assume that only biological samples retrieved from I or R+ chickens can yield a positive PCR test result. The distinction between R+ and R− compartments allows us to capture the persistence of viral RNA in infected chickens that recently stopped shedding61. We assume that the two chicken types considered here, exotic broiler and backyard chickens, share the same biological parameters, except the latent period.We model an open population of chickens that mimics the activity of an LBM: more in detail, we assume that Nb new chickens of type b = BR, BY reach the market in bulk every day, always at the same time (note that N = ∑bNb). Of these, a proportion ρb has already been exposed to influenza prior to entering the market. Chickens are then sold progressively over time, their length of stay being distributed as in Supplementary Fig. 1A. We assume for simplicity that the distribution of length of stay of backyard chickens is the same as that of broilers. Supplementary Fig. 15 shows that this assumption does not affect epidemic dynamics significantly.Equivalence between direct and environmental transmissionUnder environmental transmission, the expression for the force of infection becomes Λenv(t) = βenvIenv(t)/N, where Ienv(t) represents viral load in the environment at time t; its physical units are arbitrary, but chosen in a way that Ienv increases by an amount I(t) (i.e. the prevalence of infectious chickens) between t and t + 1.A mapping between β and βenv that (approximately) preserves stationary viral dynamics can be obtained as follows: let \(\tilde{T}\) denote the average time a single chicken spends at the market while infectious. Under direct transmission, its spreading potential is given by \(\beta \tilde{T}\); under environmental transmission, the same quantity is evaluated as:$${\beta }_{env}\tilde{T}\mathop{\sum }\limits_{t=0}^{\infty }{e}^{-\Theta t},$$ (2) where the last sum accounts for the persistence and progressive decay of infectious faeces in the environment. Equating the two expressions yields the relation βenv = β ⋅ (1 − e−Θ).Field data collectionThe field experiment consisted in caging 10 chickens together at a market stall for 84 h, and sampling them for positivity to AIV at four time points, T1 = 0, T2 = 12, T3 = 36 and T4 = 84 h during the duration of the experiment. Of these 10 chickens, a group of 5 were recruited directly at the market right before T1 (control group), while the remaining 5 birds had been recruited 2.5 days in advance (T0) from farms (intervention group) and stored in a biosecure environment before being introduced to the LBM at T1. The experiment was repeated 30 times with exotic broilers and 34 with backyard chickens for a total of 300 and 340 chickens, respectively. In this work, we removed 80 broiler chickens corresponding to 8 experimental replicates where there was a suspect of cross-contamination of samples. More details about the experimental design can be found in ref. 33. Ethical approval for the initial study was obtained from both City University of Hong Kong and Chattogram Veterinary and Animal Sciences University.Fitting the model to field dataIn the context of experimental data, we further distinguish between intervention (i) and control (c) chickens. This translates into four introduction parameters ρg,b, according to each combination of group g ∈ {c, i} and type b. We assume that control and bulk (i.e. marketed chickens that were not part of the experiment) chickens are equivalent in all aspects, meaning that ρb = ρc,b. Finally, compartment-specific introduction probabilities are fully determined by specifying three hyper-parameters λBR, λBY and κ. Briefly, these set the timing of prior exposure, under the assumption that the latter is gamma-distributed with type-specific rate λ and shared shape parameter κ. Further mathematical details can be found in Supplementary Methods.We used a Bayesian MCMC approach to infer parameters θ listed in Table 1. We chose priors that penalise large values of β and set a narrow range for \({T}_{EI}=({\sigma }_{BR}^{-1}+{\sigma }_{BY}^{-1})/2+{\mu }^{-1}\), i.e. the average time from exposure to viral clearance; for a full account of fitted parameters’ priors see Supplementary Table 1. The likelihood function is multinomial (see Supplementary Methods), and depends on the probability of a chicken testing positive for the first time at market entrance, i.e. T0 or T1, or during any other time segment [Tj, Tj+1]; in addition, we also account for chickens that remain susceptible throughout the experiment or until early removal. We resort to numerical simulations to evaluate the likelihood, since an explicit representation of individual probabilities in terms of model parameters is not available. Simulations feature both bulk and recruited chickens from intervention and control groups. Importantly, we assume that recruited chickens do not contribute to transmission, but they can still be affected by exposure to infectious bulk chickens, which are way more abundant than the former. Intervention and control animals are recruited at times T0 and T1, respectively, and can not leave the market. From T0 to T1, intervention chickens are completely isolated from any source of infection, consistently with experimental conditions.The inference routine is based on an ensemble sampler from the Python module emcee, version 3.1.162. Briefly, this sampler runs l chains in parallel, and makes proposals based on the collective state of all chains. We checked MCMC convergence by visual inspection, e.g. by looking at trace plots (Supplementary Fig. 16), and by looking at MCMC acceptance rates.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.

On July 16, 2023, an outbreak of H5N1 bird flu in household cats was reported by the World Health Organization, underscoring that these viruses can infect and cause illness in household pets. CDC’s risk assessment for the general public remains low. CDC Update July 21, 2023 – An outbreak of H5N1 bird flu in household cats was recently reported by the World Health Organization, underscoring that these viruses can infect and cause illness in household pets. Thirty-four domestic cats across eight provinces in Poland tested positive for avian influenza A(H5N1) virus ("H5N1 bird flu"). Many of the infected cats showed neurological signs (e.g., paralysis, seizures) and became severely ill or died. H5N1 bird flu viruses are widespread globally among wild birds and domestic poultry and have caused sporadic infections in mammals. It is important to note that a review of the genetic sequences of the viruses found in cats in Poland does not show any reason to change CDC's risk assessment to human health, which remains low for the general public. Further, there is no evidence of cat-to cat-transmission. While domestic animals, including cats, rarely become infected with H5N1, it has been reported, most often after eating raw, sick, or dead infected wild birds or poultry or being in environments contaminated by them. Among the infected cats, most lived inside with partial outdoor access (e.g., via balconies or terraces); however, some were primarily outdoor cats with potential exposures to wild birds. Some infected cats were fed raw poultry or poultry parts. Of the thirty-four infected cats, eleven died from their infection and fourteen were euthanized. The source of H5N1 exposure remains unclear. Investigators have not found evidence that this virus is spreading from cat-to-cat. Also, no illness has been reported in cat owners or other people exposed to the cats. Preliminary genetic sequencing of the viruses isolated from cats indicate these are from the H5 2.3.4.4b clade, which are similar to the viruses that have been circulating in wild birds and poultry recently in Poland. The viruses include genetic changes that previously have been associated with more severe illness and better ability to spread in mammals. However, there are no changes that would suggest these viruses could easily bind to receptors in the upper respiratory tract of humans, nor any changes that would suggest the viruses were adapted to more easily spread to people. The latter changes would be needed to infect people more easily and to spread more easily among people. Sequencing also found that these viruses are well-matched to a candidate vaccine virus (CVV) developed by CDC in 2022. CVVs are used to produce vaccine for people, if needed. The existing 2022 CVV would provide good protection against these viruses based on genetic sequencing. Bird flu infections among domestic animals are rare. However, if your pet is showing signs of illness suggesting bird flu virus infection and has been exposed to infected (sick or dead) wild birds/poultry or has eaten raw food containing poultry products, you should immediately contact your pet's veterinarian or state animal health official. Additionally, monitor your own health and the health of other household members with close contact with your pet for signs of infection, including fever, cough, difficulty breathing/shortness of breath, conjunctivitis (eye tearing, redness, irritation, or discharge from eye), runny or stuffy nose, or diarrhea. It unlikely that pet owners would get sick with bird flu through direct contact with their infected pet, but it is possible. The risk to human health from H5N1 bird flu infections in cats is thought to be low. Current H5N1 outbreaks in poultry and birds (with occasional spillovers into mammals and people) continues to be mostly an animal health issue. However, people should avoid direct and close contact with sick or dead wild birds, poultry, and sick or dead wild animals. CDC has information about precautions to take with wild birds and guidance for pet owners and people who may have direct contact with infected animals. More information about avian influenza is available on the CDC website.

Guidance for farm workers and employers can be found online. Updates to this page are forthcoming. May 3, 2024 EspaÃ±ol Backyard Flock Owners: Protect Yourself from Bird Flu What to know The recommendation to wear PPE when in contaminated areas (primary poultry housing: coops, runs, barns, etc.) depends on whether a 150-day fallow is used for virus elimination after flock depopulation. Steps to protect yourself If birds in your flock have avian (bird) influenza (flu) A virus infection, or you suspect they might, take the following actions to protect yourself: Don't touch sick or dead birds, their feces or litter, or any surface or water source (for example, ponds, waterers, buckets, pans, troughs) that might be contaminated with their saliva, feces, or any other bodily fluids without wearing personal protective equipment (PPE). Wear PPE when around sick or dead birds. As best as possible, during depopulation and while cleaning and disinfecting contaminated premises, avoid stirring up dust, bird waste, and feathers to prevent virus from dispersing into the air. Once bird flu infection is confirmed within a flock and premises, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) recommends that backyard owners continue to wear PPE when in contaminated areas until there are no longer infected birds, eggs, feces, or contaminated litter on the property. The recommendation to wear PPE when in contaminated areas (primary poultry housing: coops, runs, barns, etc.) depends on whether a 150-day fallow is used for virus elimination after flock depopulation. Cleaning and disinfecting USDA has information on cleaning and disinfecting or fallowing of premises that were contaminated with highly pathogenic avian influenza virus and information on good biosecurity practices: Cleaning & Disinfection Basics (Virus Elimination) (usda.gov) [2 Pages, 11.33" × 14.67"] Checklist for Cleaning and Disinfecting Poultry Enclosures (usda.gov) [ 2 Pages, 11.33" × 14.67"] Checklist for Managing Poultry Manure and Litter [2 Pages, 11.33" × 14.67"] Recommended PPE Put on PPE before you go into the coop or poultry environment. Do not wear or store PPE in your home after it has been worn in your coop and before it has been cleaned and disinfected. Put on and take off PPE in separate clean areas, if possible. View LargerDownload Put on and take off PPE in separate clean areas, if possible. PPE should include: Safety goggles (unvented or indirectly vented) that fit snugly, gloves that are disposable, rubber boots (or waterproof boots that can be disinfected) or boot covers, an N95 respirator if available, or, if not available, a well-fitting facemask (e.g., a surgical mask) coveralls that are disposable and fluid-resistant, and disposable head cover or hair cover. You can buy these items online or at many retail, hardware, or feed stores. When wearing PPE: Wear well-fitting PPE, do not touch your eyes, mouth, or nose do not touch PPE until you are taking it off, do not eat, drink or smoke while wearing PPE, and only wear PPE while you are in your coop or poultry environment. Do not wear used protective gear into your home. Removing, cleaning, and disposing of PPE: After use, clean or throw away all PPE that was worn in your coop or poultry environment, or around your birds. Safely remove PPE in this order: Clean and disinfect boots, remove boots, remove and dispose of the coveralls, remove and dispose of gloves, wash hands with soap and water, remove goggles, head cover, and respirator [ 716 KB, 1 Page, 11.33" × 14.67"], clean and disinfect reusable goggles, dispose respirator, wash hands with soap and water again. For items that need to be cleaned, clean with soap and water until visible dirt is removed, and then disinfect items with an EPA-approved disinfectant that has label claims against influenza A viruses according to the manufacturer's instructions. Clean your clothing worn underneath PPE. Clothes should be washed using detergent. A disinfectant could be added as an additional level of caution. Clothes should then be dried on high heat. Do not wear any clothing worn when in contact with infected birds again before washing. Shower right after removing PPE and cleaning clothing. Self-monitor for symptoms for 10 days after the last day of exposure to potentially infected birds or contaminated materials. If unsure, backyard flock owners should contact USDA or the State Animal Health Official to determine the date of their last exposure (the date that disposal of infected birds, eggs, manure, and litter was completed).

The patient reported eye redness, consistent with conjunctivitis, as their only symptom. In light of this, VDH is asking clinicians to maintain a low threshold for H5N1 testing if a patient presents with any relevant symptom(s) and exposure history. To date, HPAI A(H5N1) virus has not been detected in people, dairy cattle, or other domestic animals in Virginia. According to CDC, the current risk of H5N1 bird flu infections in people remains low. There is no current evidence of human-to-human HPAI A(H5N1) transmission. However, people with exposure to infected birds, cattle, or other animals are at higher risk and should take appropriate precautions. Genetic analyses of the virus from the Texas patient show no evidence of increased transmission risk or antiviral drug resistance. Two H5N1 candidate vaccines are available if the human health risk assessment changes and vaccines are needed. VDH is recommending that clinicians have a low threshold to request H5N1 testing in any person showing signs or symptoms of acute respiratory illness (including conjunctivitis) who has a relevant exposure history to cattle, unpasteurized (raw) milk, birds, other animals, or their feces, including exposure to animals with no apparent signs of infection. If an H5N1 bird flu infection is suspected, please immediately notify your local health department, who can coordinate testing with the Virginia Division of Consolidated Laboratory Services (DCLS). Specimen collection guidance can be found on the DCLS website. The following is recommended for any person with signs and symptoms compatible with avian influenza A(H5N1): Isolate the patient and follow infection control recommendations, including using PPE. Initiate empiric antiviral treatment as soon as possible. Do not delay treatment while awaiting laboratory results. Notify your local health department immediately to arrange testing for influenza A(H5N1) virus. Collect specimens from the patient to test for influenza A(H5N1) virus at the state health department laboratory. Patient with respiratory symptoms: collect one nasopharyngeal (NP) swab AND one combined nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal (NP/OP) swab Patient with conjunctivitis symptoms (with or without respiratory symptoms): collect one NP swab AND one conjunctival swab Encourage patients to isolate at home away from their household members and not go to work or school until it is determined whether they have avian influenza A(H5N1) virus infection. VDH is coordinating closely with the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (VDACS) and will ensure that local public health officials, the public, and healthcare providers have up to date information on this situation as it evolves.

Furthermore, influenza has the capability to cause a pandemic, having already done so in 1918, 1957, 1968, and 2009. Vaccination represents the best method for limiting influenza mortality and morbidity.1,2However, developing influenza vaccines is complex. Influenza viruses constantly mutate, resulting in a diverse and constantly changing array of strains. The World Health Organization (WHO) monitors influenza virus antigenic phenotypes throughout the year, an essential process for influenza-centric research efforts including the development of pan-influenza vaccines.2The most prominent circulating strains differ between distinct geographical regions and vary from year to year. As a consequence, combatting seasonal influenza currently entails the annual development of new vaccines targeting what is predicted to be the most prominent strains for the upcoming season in a given region.2To fight influenza, researchers need access to tools that let them comprehensively capture the depth and breadth of the virus’s diversity and gauge vaccine-induced antibody responses. Recombinant influenza antigens are particularly useful for simulating responses to viral infection, and companies like Sino Biological maintain sizable antigen libraries derived from prominent strains of recent years. Sino Biological, in particular, covers recombinant antigens for influenza strains spanning 2015 to 2025 and offers hemagglutinin (HA), HA trimer, neuraminidase (NA), and nucleoprotein (NP) proteins from all WHO-recommended vaccine strains in recent years. Tools such as these help scientists examine influenza pathogenesis, design new assays, and develop new vaccine candidates.Learn more about the available tools for influenza research.

Policy-ish Public Health Twitter Public Health The U.S. may be missing human cases of bird flu, scientists say May 2, 202410:01 AM ET By Will Stone Enlarge this image The U.S. Department of Agriculture is ordering dairy producers to test cows that produce milk for infections from highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI H5N1) before the animals are transported to a different state following the discovery of the virus in samples of pasteurized milk taken by the Food and Drug Administration. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Justin Sullivan/Getty Images The U.S. Department of Agriculture is ordering dairy producers to test cows that produce milk for infections from highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI H5N1) before the animals are transported to a different state following the discovery of the virus in samples of pasteurized milk taken by the Food and Drug Administration. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Officially, there is only one documented case of bird flu spilling over from cows into humans during the current U.S. outbreak. But epidemiologist Gregory Gray suspects the true number is higher, based on what he heard from veterinarians, farm owners and the workers themselves as the virus hit their herds in his state. "We know that some of the workers sought medical care for influenza-like illness and conjunctivitis at the same time the H5N1 was ravaging the dairy farms," says Gray, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. Sponsor Message "I don't have a way to measure that, but it seems biologically quite plausible that they too, are suffering from the virus," he says. Gray has spent decades studying respiratory infections in people who work with animals, including dairy cattle. He points out that "clustering of flu-like illness and conjunctivitis" has been documented with previous outbreaks involving bird flu strains that are lethal for poultry like this current one. Shots - Health News As bird flu spreads in cows, here are 4 big questions scientists are trying to answer Luckily, genetic sequencing of the virus doesn't indicate it has evolved to easily spread among humans. Still, epidemiologists say it's critical to track any possible cases. They're concerned some human infections could be flying under the radar, especially if they are mild and transient as was seen in the Texas dairy worker who caught the virus. "I think based on how many documented cases in cows there are, probably some decent human exposure is occurring," says Dr. Andrew Bowman, associate professor of veterinary preventive medicine at The Ohio State University. "We just don't really know." Limited testing raises concerns There have been 36 herds affected in nine states. Local and state health departments have tested about 25 people for the virus and monitored over 100 for symptoms, federal health officials said at a briefing on Wednesday. Sponsor Message These people are in "the footprints of where the bovine detections are," says Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, who's with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, although he didn't provide details on the actual locations. "There's a very low threshold for individuals to get tested," he adds. The lack of testing early in the outbreak isn't necessarily surprising. In places like Texas and Kansas, veterinarians weren't thinking about bird flu when illnesses first cropped up in early March and it took time to identify the virus as the culprit. But the total number of tests done on humans at this point seems low to Jessica Leibler, an environmental epidemiologist at Boston University School of Public Health. "If the idea was to try to identify where there was spillover from these facilities to human populations, you'd want to try to test as many workers as possible," says Leibler, who has studied the risk of novel zoonotic influenza and animal agriculture. Also, notes Gray, the virus is probably much more geographically widespread in cattle than the reported cases show, "possibly spilling over much more to humans than we knew, or then we know." The federal government has been quick to assess the safety of the dairy supply. On Wednesday, the Food and Drug Administration released findings, showing that infectious virus wasn't present in about 200 samples collected from dairy products around the country. Initial results on ground meat are also reassuring. However, there still remain "serious gaps" in public health officials' ability to detect bird flu among those who work with cows, a task made all the more difficult by the fact that some cases may not be symptomatic, says Leibler. "There's really widespread opportunity for worker exposure to this virus." Only complicating matters — the true scale of the outbreak in cattle remains murky, although new federal testing requirements for moving cattle between states may help fill out the picture. Sponsor Message "Some of the dairy herds seem to have clinically normal animals, but potentially infected and [that] makes it really hard to know where to do surveillance," says Bowman. Calls for proactive steps to track down possible human cases The health care system would likely catch any alarming rise in human cases of bird flu, according to modeling done by the CDC. Federal health officials monitor influenza activity in emergency departments and hospitals. Hundreds of clinical laboratories that run tests are tasked with reporting findings. And in early April, a CDC health alert was sent to clinicians advising them to be on the lookout for anyone with flu-like symptoms or conjunctivitis who'd worked with livestock. But even these safeguards may not be sufficient to get ahead of an outbreak. "I worry a bit that if we wait until we see a spike in those systems that perhaps we would already be seeing much more widespread community transmission," says Dr. Mary-Margaret Fill, deputy state epidemiologist for the Tennessee Department of Health. Instead she says there should be proactive testing. Fill notes there are anecdotes about farmworkers with mild illness while working with cattle in some of the areas where the virus has spread and "not enough visibility on the testing that's happening or not happening in those populations to understand what might be going on." To get ahead of the virus, Leibler says not only do workers need to be screened but also their family members and others in the community, in the event that the virus does evolve to spread easily among humans. Dr. Rodney Young says doctors in the Texas panhandle have been vigilant about any cases of influenza, particularly among those who are around livestock, but so far there are no indications of anything out of the ordinary. "We just haven't seen people who fit that description in order to suddenly be testing a lot more," says Young,regional chair of the Department of Family and Community Medicine at the Texas Tech Health Sciences Center School of Medicine in Amarillo. Sponsor Message Getting buy-in from dairy farms Gray says it can be hard to detect and measure the illness in these rural workers for many reasons — their remote location, a reluctance to seek out health care, a lack of health insurance, concerns about immigration status, and a reticence among farmers "to wave the flag" that there are infections. The farms he works with consider protecting workers and curbing the spread of this virus "a huge priority," but right now they bear all the risks of going public, he says. Dr. Fred Gingrich says this is a major barrier to closer cooperation between federal health officials and the industry during the current crisis. Dairy cattle farmers currently don't get compensated for reporting infections in their herds — unlike poultry farmers who receive indemnity payments for losses related to culling birds when they find cases, says Gingrich, executive director of the American Association of Bovine Practitioners. "So what is their incentive to report?" he says, "It's the same virus. It just doesn't kill our cows." Gray has managed to start collecting samples from humans and cattle at several dairy farms that recently dealt with the virus. It's part of a study that he launched before the H5N1 outbreak in response to concerns about SARS-CoV-2 spillover on farms. They'll look for evidence of exposure to novel influenza, including bird flu --something he's able to pull off because of his background in this area and his guarantee that the farms will be kept anonymous in the published work. What concerns him most is the possibility the outbreak could wind up at another kind of farm. "We know when it hits the poultry farms because the birds die, but the pigs may or may not manifest severe illness," he says, "The virus can just churn, make many copies of itself and the probability of spilling over to those workers is much greater." avian flu bird flu influenza Facebook Flipboard Email Read & Listen Home News Culture Music Podcasts & Shows Connect Newsletters Facebook Instagram Press Public Editor Corrections Contact & Help About NPR Overview Diversity NPR Network Accessibility Ethics Finances Get Involved Support Public Radio Sponsor NPR NPR Careers NPR Shop NPR Events NPR Extra Terms of Use Privacy Your Privacy Choices Text Only Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsorFigure 4 - Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza A(H5N1) Clade 2.3.4.4b Virus Infection in Domestic Dairy Cattle and Cats, United States, 2024 - Volume 30, Number 7—July 2024 - Emerging Infectious Diseases journal - CDC Skip directly to site content Skip directly to page options Skip directly to A-Z link Skip directly to A-Z link Skip directly to A-Z link Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

They also analyzed samples from cats that died on the farms. The initial H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) findings prompted the initial announcement from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) on March 25. H5N1 in mammary gland cellsThe tissue samples in cows came from a three that were euthanized and three that died naturally. The researchers also performed postmortem exams on two adult cats from one of the farms, which had about 24 cats. The cats started showing symptoms a day after clinical disease was noted in the cows, and about half of the cats died.Microscopic examination revealed that the H5N1 virus infects epithelial cells of mammary alveoli where milk is produced, prompting acute inflammation in the udder, which could explain the drop in milk production and high virus levels that have been turning up in milk.The authors said the case series shows that H5N1 infection has more dramatic symptoms in cows than reflected in earlier reports of influenza A viruses in the animals. Cats showed symptoms soon after exposureMeanwhile, they wrote that the clinical disease in cats, especially neurologic symptoms, is consistent with earlier reports of H5N1 in cats and tracks with reports of cats eating infected wild birds and poultry products.Though wild-bird consumption can't be ruled out in the cats from the dairy farms, known consumption of unpasteurized milk and colostrum from infected cows, a fluid that contained a high viral load, makes it a likely exposure route, the team wrote. "Therefore, our findings suggest cross-species mammal-to-mammal transmission of HPAI H5N1 virus and raise new concerns regarding the potential for virus spread within mammal populations," they said.Ingestion of feed contaminated with feces from wild birds is the most likely initial source of infection on dairy farms, according to the authors, who said more studies are needed to clarify transmission routes and pathogenesis within infected cattle.FDA, CDC, USDA add updatesOver the past few days, federal agencies involved in the nationwide H5N1 investigation and response updated their findings and provided policy clarifications.Egg inoculation tests were negative for live infectious virus in retail milk samples that were positive for H5N1 fragments in earlier polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said in an April 26 update. It noted that the test results are preliminary but affirm its assessment that the commercial milk supply is safe.The FDA also said it tested several samples of retail powered infant formula and powdered milk products marketed as toddler formula, and all were negative for H5N1 remnants on PCR testing.Work is still under way on 297 retail samples from 38 states. The agency said that samples that are positive on PCR testing will go through egg inoculation testing.Meanwhile, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in an update on the same day says its ongoing susceptibility testing on commercially available antiviral drugs has found that the current H5N1 strain is susceptible to baloxavir marboxil (Xofluza).The CDC said its earlier studies showed that the H5N1 virus from the human case in Texas was susceptible to other antivirals, including oseltamivir. However, it said one of the 200 publicly posted H5N1 samples from dairy cows found a marker with a known link to reduced susceptibility to neuraminidase inhibitors."The detection of this marker in one of more than 200 specimens is not surprising or concerning at this time in terms of the clinical usefulness of these drugs, but it does underscore why this kind of constant monitoring is important," the agency wrote.Finally, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) on April 27 clarified its recent federal order barring interstate movement of lactating dairy cows without tests to ensure that the animals aren't infected with HPAI H5N1.It said the clarification notes that the order doesn't apply to the interstate movement of dairy cows going to sale barns, which are sometimes used to consolidate and move cattle to slaughter out of state. "We are announcing this clarification over the weekend to ensure small farms have the guidance necessary to continue to move cull cattle and limit animal welfare issues," the USDA said.

Now, in a study published in Acta Neuropathologica, researchers have revealed that IAE may be caused by the virus entering the brain through a specific cell type, and have identified possible treatment strategies. Although IAE is increasingly common, surprisingly little is known about how the influenza virus actually gets into the brain and causes symptoms of encephalopathy (a general term for brain disorders). Notably, a definitive treatment for IAE remains lacking, something that researchers from Osaka University wanted to address. To study how influenza viruses might cause IAE, the research team used a range of methods. As well as looking for virus particles in the brains of people who died from IAE, they created a mouse model of the disease by injecting influenza A virus into the blood. They also used cell culture methods to look at how well the virus infects different cell types. In the human brains, the virus-injected mice, and the cultured cells, the influenza virus tended to accumulate in endothelial cells. These cells create a barrier between the blood and the brain, and are important for protecting the brain from harmful substances." Shihoko Kimura-Ohba, lead author of the study Accordingly, in both the human brains and the mouse model, the barrier between the blood and the brain was compromised. Furthermore, the researchers noticed that the virus wasn't actually reproducing within these endothelial cells-;but there were a lot of proteins made by the virus. "When we saw this viral protein accumulation in the brain, we realized that antiviral medications aimed at stopping viral proliferation were unlikely to help," says Tomonori Kimura, senior author of the study. "However, antivirals aimed at stopping viral transcription and translation-;vital processes for making proteins-;are also available."

In the mouse model of IAE, these antivirals were also very effective when used early enough, suggesting that they may be useful in human patients. Given that many different kinds of viruses, including COVID-19, can cause encephalopathy, these findings have wide-ranging impacts. Moreover, although IAE care is improving, more than half of all patients die or have long-lasting symptoms. A better understanding of how viruses can cause encephalopathy will be important for developing new, effective treatments. Source:Osaka UniversityJournal reference:Kimura-Ohba, S., et al. (2024).

Back to Healio Key takeaways:Hospitalizations began to rise in 50-year-old patients, rather than those 65 and older.Influenza-related outpatient visits were highest among patients aged 18 to 34 years.Influenza-related hospitalization rates begin to increase in patients at a younger age than previously assumed, indicating that prevention strategies should be encouraged for younger patients, researchers found. “The study was prompted by limited existing research on how the burden of influenza varies with increasing age,” Ian McGovern, MPH, associate director of the Center of Outcomes Research and Epidemiology at CSL Seqirus, told Healio. Data derived from McGovern I, et al. Clin Infect Dis. 2024;doi:10.1093/cid/ciae180. “While the focus of influenza interventions and public health initiatives in adults is often among those over the age of 65 or with specific risk factors for influenza, there is evidence that individuals between the ages of 50 and 64 are also at an elevated risk from influenza infection and severe outcomes following infection,” McGovern said.To evaluate how the incidence of influenza-related health care encounters varies among adult age groups, the researchers retrospectively evaluated adult patients across five seasons from 2015 to 2020. Electronic medical records linked to pharmacy and medical claims were then used to establish patient characteristics and outcomes.Overall, the study showed that the incidence of influenza-related outpatient visits was highest among people aged 18 to 34 years and declined with increasing age, with ED visits also being elevated for patients of this age group. ED visits remained stable among patients aged 35 through 60 years but rapidly increased after 60 years. The study also showed that hospitalization incidence remained stable until about 50 years of age, when it then began to increase. McGovern said that this trend suggests a “gradual shift” in the burden of disease toward younger age groups than previously recognized. He added that this could impact how manufacturers and health care providers should approach influenza protection. “While influenza vaccination is recommended for all eligible individuals 6 months of age and older in the U.S., there are substantial differences in coverage between age groups,” McGovern said. “Notably, older adults 65 years of age or older receive the most burden of influenza as well as the most vaccination effort, with an influenza coverage of 69.7% compared with 50.1% for individuals 50 to 64 years and 35.2% for those 18 to 49 years.”He added that this shows there is an opportunity to “ramp up education to younger adults to encourage vaccination and increase rates so that they more closely reflect those of adults 65 years of age or older.”Additional findings from the study showed that among patients with an influenza-related outpatient visit, 1.6% to 2.8% of those 18 to 49 years old, 3.4% to 4.5% of those 50 to 64 years old and 5.5% to 7.9% of those 65 years and older had a pneumonia-related medical encounter within 2 weeks. Across all five seasons, 40.8% and 17.% of patients were prescribed antivirals and antibiotics, respectively, after an influenza-related medical encounter. Antivirals were more commonly prescribed to patients aged 18 to 64 years compared with older adults, whereas antibiotics were more commonly prescribed to those aged 50 years and older. McGovern said that these findings call for broader reconsideration of at-risk populations.“To help reduce influenza-related hospitalizations for adults aged 50 and above, strategies to encourage influenza vaccination should expand their focus to include people aged 50 to 64 years, in addition to the ongoing emphasis on those who are 65 years and older,” he said. “[The findings also] emphasizes the importance of influenza vaccination as a critical tool in combating not only the direct burden of influenza but also the risk of antimicrobial resistance driven by the frequent prescription of antivirals and antibiotics following influenza infections.” Published by: Sources/DisclosuresCollapse Source: McGovern I, et al.

However, it received 10 more reports of pediatric flu deaths, raising the season's total to 158. The deaths occurred between early January and the middle of April. Six were due to influenza A, and of four subtyped viruses, three were 2009 H1N1 and one involved H3N2. Three kids died from influenza B infections and one death occurred in a child who was coinfected with influenza A and influenza B.COVID hospitalization data tracking changesMeanwhile, the CDC's latest COVID data updates show further declines in severity markers, which include hospitalizations and deaths, as well as its early indicators, which include emergency department visits and test positivity. Wastewater SARS-CoV-2 detections, another early indicator, remain at the minimal level.The CDC recently announced that as of May 1, hospitals are no longer required to report COVID hospital admissions, hospital capacity, or hospital occupancy data to the Department of Health and Human Services through the CDC's National Healthcare Safety Network, which will change how the data appear on the COVID data tracker going forward.Instead of national admission counts, the data will show COVID hospitalization rates per 100,000 population though COVID-NET, which covers 300 hospitals across 13 states. The CDC said it encourages states to continue to report COVID hospitalizations voluntarily.HHS has proposed a new rule that would require hospitals to report weekly data apart from a public health emergency, according to a recent Federal Register notice. According to the rule, which if finalized would take effect on October 1, hospitals would have to electronically report information on COVID, flu, and RSV.The rule is part of a broader group of rule changes, and the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services is taking comments through June 10. Rotavirus vaccination not tied to NICU outbreaks, researchers say News brief Mary Van Beusekom, MS Topics Rotavirus Erskine Palmer / CDC The benefits of vaccinating vulnerable preterm infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) against diarrhea-causing rotavirus outweigh the risks, according to a US study being presented this weekend at the Pediatric Academic Societies (PAS) 2024 Meeting in Toronto.The finding that rotavirus vaccination doesn't cause significant hospital outbreaks is important because many NICUs don't give the vaccine because of fears of viral transmission (the vaccine contains a weakened form of rotavirus), and some babies are too old to receive it after NICU release, researchers from the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) said in a PAS news release.The researchers assessed the risk of vaccinated infants spreading highly contagious rotavirus to unvaccinated babies in NICUs that administer the vaccine. They analyzed 3,448 weekly stool samples from 774 newborns from January 2021 to January 2022.99% of unvaccinated babies weren't infectedLess than 1% of unvaccinated infants exposed to vaccinated babies contracted rotavirus, and their symptoms resolved after 2 weeks. Inpatient vaccination allows protection of a vulnerable population against a common, preventable cause of severe diarrheal illness. Kathleen Gibbs, MD "Immunization with rotavirus vaccine has been standard practice in the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia NICU since 2007, and the safety of this practice was supported by retrospective clinical data published in Pediatrics in 2014—however this remains an uncommon practice in NICUs across the United States," lead author Kathleen Gibbs, MD, of CHOP, said in the release. "Our yearlong, prospective study done in collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests that benefits of vaccinating NICU patients against rotavirus outweigh risks," she added. "Inpatient vaccination allows protection of a vulnerable population against a common, preventable cause of severe diarrheal illness."

It is designed to develop and apply measures to assess the severity of every influenza epidemic. The newly published 2024 PISA guidance update broadens the scope of PISA to include syndromic data as well as influenza-specific data. It uses existing routine surveillance data from countries and relies on the qualitative assessment of four indicators to assess the severity of influenza: transmissibility of an influenza virus, seriousness of influenza diseases, morbidity and mortality and impact on health care capacity. SEARO is pleased to announce the successful completion of two important PISA training workshops in Bangladesh and Bhutan, facilitated by WHO SEARO and a PISA consultant from WHO Head Quarters. This activity was supported by the Pandemic Influenza Preparedness (PIP) Partnership Contribution (PC) fund.In Bangladesh, 20 participants from the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) and the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr, b) received training focused on orientating to the WHO average curve and the Moving Epidemic Method for PISA from 21st -23rd April 2024. Both IEDCR and icddr, b data were demonstrated to be suitable for reporting three out of the four PISA indicators namely:Transmissibility: % positivity for influenza from ILI surveillance from both IEDCR and icddr, b,Morbidity & Mortality: % positivity for influenza from SARI surveillance from both IEDCR and Number of SARI or influenza-confirmed SARI cases from both IEDCR and icddr, b, /OR icddr, b ANDSeriousness of Disease: proportion of SARI or influenza-confirmed SARI hospitalizations that receive oxygen support from icddr, bIn the future, Bangladesh may also report on the fourth indicator (Impact on healthcare capacity) using healthcare resource monitoring data (proportion of hospital beds occupied).In Bhutan, the training was provided to 12 participants from the Royal Centre for Disease Control (RCDC) on all three threshold setting methods for PISA from 24th- 26th April 2024. Due to the high quality of the data and the almost year-round circulation of influenza, the WHO average curve method was recommended over other methods and ultimately was used to report on two PISA indicators:Transmissibility: ILI composite (i.e., ILI x % positivity for influenza from ILI)Morbidity and Mortality: SARI composite (i.e., SARI x % positivity for influenza from SARI)Bhutan has the potential to use SARI: ILI ratios for the third indicator namely seriousness of disease depending on its usefulness for the country. Further, PISA data for the first 18 weeks of 2024 have already been uploaded to RespiMart by RCDC and are visible in PISA PowerBI outputs.The application of PISA enables Member States to be better prepared to assess the severity of influenza epidemics or pandemics. To strengthen the capacity of Member States in assessing the severity of future influenza epidemics and pandemics in the region, WHO SEARO, in collaboration with WHO HQ, plans to roll out PISA approach in other Member States. These efforts will help build capacities for enhancing influenza risk assessment, preparedness for, and response to influenza pandemics/epidemics. The efforts of SEARO will be further strengthened by WHO HQ’s plans for continued improvement of training materials and resources to support countries in implementing the updated PISA guidance.

H5N1 Avian influenza is spreading among US cattle herds, most probably during the time of milking. Most H5N1 infections spreading through US dairy cattle and other animal populations are likely going undetected despite stepped up surveillance by the US Department of Agriculture, Michael Osterholm, director of the Centre for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP), told Health Policy Watch on Wednesday. Osterholm spoke as a growing number of infectious experts were sounding alarm bells about the expanding spread of the deadly virus to mammalian populations – and especially dairy cattle in the United States, where some 36 herds have so far been infected, according to the latest US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) update April 30. Sanitation gaps and lax surveillance in industrial dairy operations are facilitating H5N1 transmission, experts now suggest. Total number of H5N1 cases in different animals in the US. Infection spread in dairy cattle, the newest ‘terrain’ for the virus, is causing the most concern. And “most” infections are likely going undetected due to farmer reluctance to have cattle and employees tested for avian flu, warned Osterholm, an internationally-known expert. “We need much more extensive follow up, serology studies and close monitoring of mixing vessel animal species, e.g. pigs,” Osterholm stressed in emailed remarks. He noted that pig infections, for example, constitute a “mixing vessel animal species” because they can become co-infected with both animal and human forms of avian influenza, increasing the risks of spread to humans of a virus that has a greater than 50% fatality rate. On the positive side, Osterholm added that it was “very unlikely” pasteurized milk could transmit the infection if pasteurization “is done properly.” Policymakers have taken their ‘eye off the ball’ of ‘One Health’ principles “Policymakers have again taken their eyes off the ball in efforts to protect humanity from new pandemics,” stated Dr Nigel Sizer, an Executive Director of the non-profit Preventing Pandemics at the Source (PPATS), as part of a stiff warning issued Tuesday by half a dozen international experts on the wave of H5N1 infections. “In this case, it is hard not to point the finger at lax monitoring and regulation of animal agriculture in the United States and elsewhere,” Sizer said. Colorized transmission electron micrograph of Avian influenza A H5N1 viruses (seen in gold) grown in MDCK cells (seen in green). The expanding outbreak takes place as WHO member states are in the throes of finalizing a draft Pandemic Accord agreement, where a commitment to stronger “One Health” measures for preventing spillovers of animal pathogens to humans remains a sticking point for some countries in the Global South. But in the case of the USA, a dearth of surveillance is also a hallmark of the rapidly expanding avian flu outbreak in the Global North, other experts also pointed out. “The situation with avian influenza across the United States exemplifies the inherent hypocrisy and vested economic interests around Pandemic Prevention, Preparedness, and Response,” said Dr. Christian Walzer, Executive Director of Health at the Wildlife Conservation Society, and a professor at the University of Veterinary Medicine in Vienna, Austria, in the PPATS statement of experts. “As one hundred ninety-four member states of the World Health Organization (WHO) are negotiating perceived responsibilities and equity around a new Pathogen Access and Benefits-Sharing [PABS] Mechanism – while the Global North is demanding transparent and rapid access to pathogen data from the Global South to develop diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics, it seems unwilling to share such information with the world,” Walzer said. Spread through milking machines Among dairy cows, H5N1 appears to be transmitting rapidly through their mammary glands via virus contaminated milking machines, Stat News reported on Tuesday. The milking equipment is typically not sanitized between sessions with individual animals, becoming an obvious transmission path to infection by more and more cows from the herd. Experts such as Jared Taylor, a professor of veterinary pathobiology at Oklahoma State University, noted that the H5N1 infections in cattle herds reported so far have been limited to lactating dairy cows. And the ones who produce most milk – and therefore spend more time on the milking machines – have the highest disease incidence. Even more worrisome is the potential presence of the virus in raw milk – which some consumers in the USA as well as in Europe prefer as a more ‘natural’ alternative. US states where H1N5 has been detected in cattle There also have been virus remnants found in pasteurised milk. “The role of pasteurization in inactivation of the virus […] is currently being investigated,” states a 23 April assessment by the WHO, issued jointly with the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH). Infection with H5N1 from pasteurised milk is, however, “very unlikely, if [the pasteurisation is] done properly,” Osterholm said. As compared with consumers, farm workers who have everyday contact with cattle are, however, at a far higher risk of infection. And the one case of human infection reported in March, does not reflect the scale of the disease spread to people, experts say because farmers have been reluctant to allow testing of cattle or employees, and such testing remains voluntary. That’s why “most” cases likely go undetected, Osterholm told Health Policy Watch. Avian influenza as symptom of world’s failure to apply ‘One Health’ measures Virus spillovers to more and more species are a direct effect of the poor animal management practices in the intensive livestock production conditions that are common throughout the developed world today, said Sizer in the statement on April 30. “Improved animal husbandry conditions, more rigorous inspection standards, as well as better reporting and sharing of animal health information could reduce the risk of these outbreaks as well as improve the welfare of the animals we consume,” he asserted. “We must question for how much longer consumers will have to worry that the price of a cheap sausage or steak is the risk of another global pandemic.” One Health principles recognize the interlinkages between ecosystems, animal and human health, and call for enhanced collaboration between sectors to prevent zoonotic spillover into human populations. “This outbreak highlights the need for One Health approaches for preventing spillovers and interventions to reduce risk of such threats ‘at source’,” argued Dr. Malik Peiris, Professor of Virology at the School of Public Health at The University of Hong Kong, and a leading H5N1 expert. Pigs are an important possible intermediary host for avian influenza. “There is still a widespread philosophy of aiming for maximum profit in meat production, when it should be about optimizing food security, food safety, animal welfare and ecological sustainability,” added Dr. Dirk Pfeiffer, Professor of One Health at City University of Hong Kong, in the same statement, adding: “Global investors who see opportunities in making money out of meat production should be aware that ‘growing cattle, pigs or chickens’ is not the same as making parts for mobile telephones.” WHO still ranks human health risks as low or low-to moderate In its 23 April assessment, WHO ranked avian influenza risks to humans as low generally insofar as human-to-human transmission has never been documented, and low-to-moderate for those “with exposure to infected birds or animals or contaminated environments.” Only one human case connected with the US outbreak has been reported, a cattle worker from Texas. Since 2003, WHO reported only rare instances of human infections all from close contact with animals. Even so, the mortality was “extraordinarily high,” according to WHO Chief Scientist Jeremy Farrar. He was referring to the 52% mortality rate registered amongst the 889 human cases of H5N1 reported to WHO between 2003 and 1 April 2024. Jeremy Farrar, WHO Chief Scientist, during a press briefing April 18 “Being one of the few people around the world who have actually treated patients with H5N1 […] this remains I think an enormous concern,” Farrar stressed at an April 18 media briefing in Geneva. From 1996 until 2013, Farrar was Director of the Oxford University Clinical Research Unit in Ho Chi Minh City, where he and a Vietnamese colleague identified the re-emergence of the deadly bird flu, or H5N1, in humans in 2004. What worries experts the most is the virus’s expanding host range. Naturally found in wild birds, avian influenza has developed a limited ability to infect other species, including mammals. The recent joint assessment by WHO, FAO and WOAH reports mentions the virus as the probable source of infection in sea mammals, multiple fur animal farms and ferret-to-ferret infections, according to some studies. The list of infected animals is getting longer: cats, dogs, goat kids or polar bears, already known to suffer from the disease were recently joined by a walrus, as The Guardian reported. “The great concern, of course, is […] that that virus now evolves and develops the ability to infect humans. And then critically, the ability to go from human-to-human transmission,” Farrar told the media briefing. Reassurance, but… Other WHO officials have still sought to issue a more reassuring note. Speaking at another WHO press briefing on April 24, Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, a WHO epidemiologist, asserted that appropriate surveillance systems are working well. “We are concerned about this particular virus because we know influenza has the potential to cause epidemics that have the potential to cause pandemics,” she said. “And that’s why we have a global system in place to monitor, detect, and to rapidly do risk assessments to look at viruses that could potentially be used in vaccines as we go forward. There’s a lot of work in place right now,” she said. Since the beginning of 2021, 28 detections of H5N1 in humans have been reported to WHO, with all nine cases reported in Europe or North America being assymptomatic or mild cases, notes the WHO/FAO/WOAH joint assessment. Still the three agencies also recommended tougher monitoring – calling on national authorities to use “active case finding and serologic methods, as well as work with national agencies to understand the exposure and risk from milk and milk products.” Osterholm, like other experts doubts that US authorities have the situation under control. What’s needed is, among others, a “much more extensive follow up,” said Osterholm. He also advises a close monitoring of pigs, which have “influenza virus receptors for both avian and human influenza viruses. “If they get coinfected with both viruses simultaneously then viral reassortment can occur and a new human virus emerge, like what happened in 2009 with the new H1N1 [strain] that emerged in swine in Mexico.” With editing and reporting contributions by Elaine Ruth Fletcher Image Credits: Josh Kelahan, US CDC, CDC/ Courtesy of Cynthia Goldsmith, Flickr: Dutchairplaneshooter.

Cows are seen standing in a feedlot in June in Quemado, Texas. The USDA has counted more than 30 herds of dairy cows infected with H5N1 influenza. Brandon Bell/Getty Images CNN — Spikes of influenza A virus seen in wastewater samples from 59 sewer systems across 18 different states this spring may point to the spread of the H5N1 avian influenza virus that is currently infecting dairy cattle, a new study suggests. So far, the US Department of Agriculture has reported more than 30 herds of dairy cows infected with H5N1 influenza across nine states. But there are questions about how large the outbreak might be and whether the US can adequately track it. Natalia Semenova/iStockphoto/Getty Images Related article USDA says it is testing beef for H5N1 bird flu virus In a news conference last week, USDA officials admitted that it’s been difficult to get milk producers to let them test for the infection. Recent tests of milk purchased at grocery stores found genetic material from the H5N1 virus in 1 out of 5 samples tested, though further testing showed the virus fragments detected in milk were not infectious. Last week, in a multi-agency news conference on the government’s response to the spreading virus, Dr. Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the agency was looking at whether it might be feasible to use wastewater to pinpoint areas where the virus is spreading. First, he said, scientists would need to develop a test that could distinguish H5 influenza from the larger soup of circulating A-strain flu viruses. Now scientists at Emory, Stanford and Verily Life Sciences, a research organization affiliated with the WastewaterSCAN network that monitors a large network of wastewater treatment plants across the US, say they have done just that. Wastewater testing is a passive way of tracking the spread of infections. It doesn’t depend on people or animals to be swabbed to test for pathogens. Instead, evidence flows into the wastewater every time a toilet is flushed or someone dumps material down a drain. Out of 190 wastewater treatment plants that currently monitor sludge samples for influenza A, 59 saw increases of the A-strain viruses this spring, just as human flu cases were flat or falling. Wastewater experts wondered if it might be from H5N1, the highly pathogenic avian influenza infections in dairy cattle or other animals. The WastewaterSCAN team developed a test to check for the flu virus’ H5 gene and used it on stored samples from sewer systems near areas in Texas where dairy cattle had tested positive, but not including wastewater directly from the farms. The team measured both a genetic marker for influenza A viruses and genetic markers specific to H5 viruses.

The concentration of the H5 gene in the samples was nearly as high as the concentration of the influenza A viruses overall, suggesting that a large fraction of the viruses in the samples were H5N1. What’s more, the concentrations of influenza A viruses measured in these wastewater sludge samples from the Amarillo, Texas, area were “among the highest ever measured in wastewater,” the study noted. The stored sludge samples tested for the study were taken between February 4 and April 16 at two treatment plants sites in the City of Amarillo watershed, and a third wastewater treatment plant in Dallas County. The researchers confirmed wastewater processing plants sampled in the Amarillo area permitted some producers to dispose of animal byproducts, including dumped milk from dairies, which may explain the high concentrations of influenza A viruses, and H5 viruses in their samples. Just as wastewater testing has proven to be a harbinger of rising Covid-19 infections in the past, researchers say their study suggests it could be an early warning for bird flu outbreaks in farm animals, too. “We detected the H5 marker right before there was confirmed highly pathogenic avian influenza in those counties,” said Dr. Alexandria Boehm, who is a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University. “I think that is super interesting. It means that the wastewater in this particular case, with this particular pathogen, can reveal information about what was circulating in these cattle before there was information publicly available,” Boehm said. The paper was posted as a preprint on the BioRxiv server, ahead of rigorous review by outside experts. The researchers say they are working to get it published in a scientific journal. The study authors stress that no H5N1 outbreaks in cows have been reported in any of the sewersheds they tested. Instead, they think that the permitted dumping of milk likely caused the big spikes in H5 virus they saw in early March. The researchers note that they can’t rule out that the H5 genetic material they’re picking up in the wastewater is all from dairy cattle. It could also be from birds or even humans. In this 2016 photo, cows are seen at a dairy in California. Rich Pedroncelli/AP Related article US government will require more testing, tracking of bird flu in dairy cows The researchers say they also don’t have enough information to know where the increases in influeza A virus are coming from across multiple states. “We don’t know the answer to that question. It is something that I think needs to be followed up on,” Boehm said. But if the spike in viruses is from dumped milk or other animal waste across the sewersheds they monitor — and that’s still a pretty big if — it means the outbreak is likely far more widespread than is currently known. “If dairy industry activities in these sewersheds are a primary source of H5 in wastewater, this suggests that there may be additional, unidentified outbreaks among cattle with milk sent to these facilities since milk from infected animals is required to be diverted from the food supply,” the study authors note. But the researchers also say their results should be interpreted carefully. Without tracking down possible sources in the sewersheds they monitor, the source of the virus can’t be proven. “However, multiple lines of evidence suggest animal sources,” the paper says. The researchers say their testing method is very sensitive. It can detect even small amounts of the genetic material from the H5 viruses, but they can’t tell if the viruses would be able to infect people and make them sick. Boehm says they didn’t try to culture the virus to see if it could infect cells.

The US Food and Drug Administration said last week that it has been testing samples of pasteurized milk in which traces of the H5N1 virus have been detected and so far found the milk is not infectious and cannot make people sick. The wastewater researchers acknowledge that it’s also possible that their tests are picking up other types of H5 viruses, including low-pathogenic H5 influenza viruses, but they say these are not expected to be circulating in these areas at this time. “This is a situation where we really felt like we were ethically bound to share this information with colleagues through a preprint and get the conversation going, because there are unanswered questions that are really important to answer,” Boehm said.

Advanced Search Home News Releases Multimedia Meetings Login Register News Release 2-May-2024 Promising new treatment strategy for deadly flu-related brain disorders Researchers from Osaka University find that some influenza-associated brain disorders may be caused by the virus entering the brain and making proteins, suggesting that antivirals that block protein production might be an effective treatment Peer-Reviewed Publication Osaka University image: The IAE pathogenesis, with severe brain edema caused by IAV, could be established without viral proliferation: Influenza virus protein was produced and accumulated in the influenza virus-infected endothelial cells (EC). Without producing daughter virus, accumulated viral protein induced necrosis of EC and disruption of blood-brain barrier leading to vascular leakage and bleeding. view more Credit: ©2024 Kimura-Ohba Osaka, Japan – It might start simply, with a cough or sneeze…but in some cases, the flu virus can make its way to your brain, causing serious symptoms or even death through a disease known as influenza-associated encephalopathy (IAE). Now, in a study published in Acta Neuropathologica, researchers have revealed that IAE may be caused by the virus entering the brain through a specific cell type, and have identified possible treatment strategies. Although IAE is increasingly common, surprisingly little is known about how the influenza virus actually gets into the brain and causes symptoms of encephalopathy (a general term for brain disorders). Notably, a definitive treatment for IAE remains lacking, something that researchers from Osaka University wanted to address. To study how influenza viruses might cause IAE, the research team used a range of methods. As well as looking for virus particles in the brains of people who died from IAE, they created a mouse model of the disease by injecting influenza A virus into the blood. They also used cell culture methods to look at how well the virus infects different cell types. “In the human brains, the virus-injected mice, and the cultured cells, the influenza virus tended to accumulate in endothelial cells,” explains lead author of the study Shihoko Kimura-Ohba. “These cells create a barrier between the blood and the brain, and are important for protecting the brain from harmful substances.” Accordingly, in both the human brains and the mouse model, the barrier between the blood and the brain was compromised. Furthermore, the researchers noticed that the virus wasn’t actually reproducing within these endothelial cells—but there were a lot of proteins made by the virus. “When we saw this viral protein accumulation in the brain, we realized that antiviral medications aimed at stopping viral proliferation were unlikely to help,” says Tomonori Kimura, senior author of the study. “However, antivirals aimed at stopping viral transcription and translation—vital processes for making proteins—are also available.” When the team tried these classes of antivirals in endothelial cells treated with influenza virus, they observed less viral proteins and cell death. In the mouse model of IAE, these antivirals were also very effective when used early enough, suggesting that they may be useful in human patients. Given that many different kinds of viruses, including COVID-19, can cause encephalopathy, these findings have wide-ranging impacts. Moreover, although IAE care is improving, more than half of all patients die or have long-lasting symptoms. A better understanding of how viruses can cause encephalopathy will be important for developing new, effective treatments. ### The article, “Viral entry and translation in brain endothelia provoke influenza-associated encephalopathy,” was published in Acta Neuropathologica at DOI: https://doi.org/10.1007/s00401-024-02723-z About Osaka University Osaka University was founded in 1931 as one of the seven imperial universities of Japan and is now one of Japan's leading comprehensive universities with a broad disciplinary spectrum.

Research: Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza A(H5N1) Clade 2.3.4.4b Virus Infection in Domestic Dairy Cattle and Cats, United States, 2024. Image Credit: felipe caparros / Shutterstock Background The highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza viruses have long been a threat to poultry and wild bird populations worldwide. They have also been a cause for concern in recent years because of their ability to infect various mammalian species. North America experienced an outbreak of the Eurasian strain clade 2.3.4.4b of the H5N1 virus that has continued into this year, with multiple spillover events reported among marine and terrestrial mammals. The current avian influenza outbreak also poses more serious concerns since the clade has also been detected in severe cases of infections among humans in Chile and Ecuador. Recent reports from northern Texas, northeastern New Mexico, and southwestern Kansas reported a disease among dairy cattle that affected the quality and appearance of milk for a duration of approximately two weeks. Incidents of death were also reported from these states among domestic cats and wild birds, indicating a potential spillover of the avian influenza virus into cats and cattle. About the study In the present study, the researchers described the various characterization analyses performed to detect the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus infecting domestic cats and cattle in the states of Texas and Kansas. These tests were performed at the Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory at Iowa State University. Milk and tissue samples were provided to the laboratory from cattle exhibiting clinical signs such as an abrupt decrease in milk production, thickening and yellowing of milk, and decreased rumination and food intake. The tissue samples were from cows that were either euthanized or died naturally. Additionally, the laboratory also performed postmortem analyses on two domesticated cats that had died in a dairy farm in north Texas after being fed milk from the sick cows. Histopathology analyses were performed on the cerebellum, cerebrum, eye, heart, kidney, liver, lung, lymph node, and spleen obtained during the postmortem analysis of the cats. Additionally, paraffin-embedded tissues from the cats and cattle were processed for immunohistochemistry analyses using antibodies against the primary influenza A virus. Milk samples diluted with phosphate-buffered saline, homogenates of brains, mammary glands, lymph nodes, spleen, and lungs, as well as samples of serum, rumen content, and ocular fluid, were processed for viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) isolation. Real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) was performed to screen these samples for influenza A virus RNA, and only those samples that had cycle threshold values above 40 were considered positive. Additional rRT-PCR methods were then used to analyze the H5 subtype and test for the H5 clade 2.3.4.4b in the samples that were positive for influenza A virus. Furthermore, the researchers also conducted genomic sequencing for two tissue samples from the cats and two milk samples. The data obtained was analyzed to assemble eight segments of influenza A virus sequences. Of these, the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase sequences were used for phylogenetic analyses.

D) Brown staining indicates strong nuclear and intracytoplasmic immunoreactivity of intact and sloughed epithelial cells within mammary alveoli. Original magnification ×400. Results The results indicated systemic illness, viral shedding in milk, and reduced milk production observed in dairy cattle were due to infection from a strain of the H5N1 influenza A virus. This highly pathogenic avian influenza virus also resulted in the death of approximately half the cats that had consumed the milk from the sick cows. Furthermore, the histopathological analyses revealed lesions in the tissue samples from cats similar to those observed in tissue samples obtained from cats that presumably got infected after eating wild birds with avian influenza infection. The only tissues from the infected cows that were positive in the immunohistochemistry analysis using antigens against the influenza A virus were mastitic mammary gland samples. However, the tissue samples from both cats revealed microscopic lesions indicative of systemic viral infection, such as lymphocytic meningoencephalitis involving neuronal necrosis and vasculitis, lymphoplasmacytic chorioretinitis with necrosis of ganglion cells, and many more clinical findings. Additionally, the brain, heart, lung, and retinal samples were positive for influenza A virus immunoreactivity. The phylogenetic analyses using the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase sequences also revealed high similarity between the sequences from the milk samples and those from the cats. These sequences were also highly similar to published sequences for H5N1 viruses of clade 2.3.4.4b. Conclusions Overall, the results showed that domestic cats and dairy cattle were susceptible to the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus. Furthermore, viral shedding through milk increased the potential for the virus to get transmitted to other mammalian species. The recurrence of avian influenza outbreaks and the broadening of the host range are of growing concern, and surveillance of the virus in domesticated animal populations is essential to prevent the transmission of the virus across species.

They could begin shipping doses widely within weeks, if needed.So far, there’s no evidence that H5N1 is spreading person-to-person, although one dairy worker in Texas who worked closely with infected cattle had a mild infection and developed conjunctivitis, or pinkeye, in April. At a briefing Wednesday, government health officials said they are preparing for a potential scenario of H5N1 jumping from animal to person — or person to person. The virus has taken off in dairy cows, infecting at least 36 herds across nine states, raising concerns that it could acquire mutations that would make it easier to spill over into humans.Studies “suggest that the vaccines will offer good cross-protection against cattle outbreak viruses,” Demetre Daskalakis, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said on the call Wednesday.Both of the vaccine candidates are already in the nation’s stockpile in limited quantities, officials said in a previous interview. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also said Wednesday that it is testing blood samples from people previously vaccinated with an influenza vaccine to see if it generates an immune response, although it didn’t say which vaccine.Dawn O’Connell, assistant secretary for preparedness and response at the Department of Health and Human Services, told NBC News earlier there are hundreds of thousands of prefilled syringes and vials ready to ship, if needed. “We’ve been investing in a library of antigens to move out as quickly as possible should we begin to see a highly transmissible flu strain circulate,” O’Connell said.H5N1 doesn’t transmit easily between people, although global health officials remain concerned due to its high mortality rate, which hovers around 50%, according to the World Health Organization. There are no signs the virus is mutating to be more transmissible between people, officials said Wednesday. Vivien Dugan, who heads the CDC's influenza division, said that the government would begin looking at vaccination if there were alterations in the virus’s genetic code that would affect its existing countermeasures. It currently has a number of antiviral medications in supply that target influenza viruses, including Tamiflu. The people needing vaccination — and the number of doses that the U.S. would require — would hinge on how the virus changes and how widespread the outbreak becomes, experts say.Right now, there are over 100 people, most of whom work with farm animals, being monitored for signs of infection, officials said.Preparation underwayShould the U.S. need the vaccines, the federal government could ship out “hundreds of thousands of doses” within a few weeks, O’Connell said.It could have over 100 million doses shipped within three to four months.Health officials expect that people will need two doses of that vaccine, O’Connell added, meaning 100 million doses is only enough for 50 million people. Again, given this is a hypothetical, it’s possible the U.S. may not need that many vaccines. But it could also produce more, if needed, O’Connell said. They are produced using traditional vaccine technology that has been the standard approach to vaccines for decades. However, the process can take months. O’Connell said the U.S. is also pursuing a third vaccine based on the same mRNA-technology used in Pfizer’s and Moderna’s Covid vaccines. She added that an mRNA vaccine could be quicker to manufacture because “you can switch in and switch out the genetic sequencing very easily.”All three vaccines would also need approval from the Food and Drug Administration before they can be distributed across the U.S.In a statement, the FDA said it is “actively engaged” with other federal health agencies in assessing pandemic influenza vaccine candidates should the need for a vaccine arise.A number of unknownsDr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said having vaccine candidates on hand is important because it reduces the time needed to get the shots in people’s arms.During the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic, researchers eventually developed a vaccine to prevent the spread of the virus, but by the time the shots were manufactured and ready to be distributed, the outbreak had already petered out, he said. “It’s very good that we have reduced the time necessary to create a vaccine by having candidates already available, should they be needed,” he said. Despite the government having two vaccine candidates, there are still a number of questions, including how much protection the shots would provide against infection and severe illness, said Dr. Judith O’Donnell, director of infection prevention and control at Penn Presbyterian Medical Center in Philadelphia. “There’s a lot we don’t know about these candidate vaccines and how they’ll work,” she said. The U.S. has contracts with three manufacturers for pandemic influenza vaccines: GlaxoSmithKline, CSL Seqirus and Sanofi. One of the vaccine candidates is from CSL Sequirus.A spokesperson for CSL Seqirus said the company has no data available on vaccine effectiveness because the number of human cases of H5N1 is too low for studies.However, a phase 2 study testing a vaccine that targets a virus closely related to H5N1 shows that it generates a promising immune response and should “cross-react with the H5N1 viruses currently circulating in cattle in the U.S,” the spokesperson said.O’Connell said the government has a number of potential adjuvants, substances added to vaccines to boost the immune response, that could be used if needed.During the pandemic, the virus was typically severe in older adults and people with underlying health conditions. However, the 2009 H1N1 swine flu virus disproportionately affected young people. It’s unclear how this strain of H5N1 would affect people because human infections are rare. O’Donnell said that given the amount of vaccine skepticism, as well as vaccine fatigue from the pandemic, the government would also likely need to begin a vaccine campaign to persuade people to get vaccinated.“It’s very disheartening to see so much vaccine skepticism and vaccine fatigue,” she said.Berkeley Lovelace Jr.Berkeley Lovelace Jr. is a health and medical reporter for NBC News.

Often underestimated, influenza B viruses can cause significant illness and mortality, especially in children. Despite the burden of influenza B viruses globally, they remain understudied and little is known about how the immune system interacts with these viruses. A team of scientists, led by University of Melbourne Professor Katherine Kedzierska, Head of the Human T cell Laboratory at the Doherty Institute, set out to change this by delving into the intricacies of the immune response to influenza B viruses, revealing a wealth of insights previously overlooked. Published in Nature Communications, the study focused on killer T cells, also known as CD8+ T cells, which play a crucial role in the antiviral immune response, and discovered how they target influenza B viruses to combat infection. University of Melbourne Tejas Menon, Graduate Researcher at the Doherty Institute and co-first author of the paper, described the challenge of identifying the specific parts of the influenza B viruses that killer T cells bind to as like searching for a needle in a haystack. “To tackle a virus, killer T cells need to be able to recognise the virus and find the best viral parts to target,” explained Mr Menon. “As new variants of a virus emerge, killer T cells can recognise fragments that are unchanged among those influenza variants. This makes killer T cells an attractive immune population to stimulate with vaccines. “In the context of influenza B viruses, we were excited to discover nine viral fragments which provoked a strong immune response from killer T cells and remained unchanged in the ‘virus' history’. This finding, reached after sieving through hundreds of influenza B virus particles, which was done in collaboration Professor Purcell and Dr Illing from Monash University, is a significant advancement in our understanding of influenza B immunity.” Until now, only 18 such viral fragments had been identified, limiting the ability to generate new vaccines against influenza B viruses that prevent severe illness and death. This comprehensive study brings the total to 27, offering more options for vaccine development. Researchers also explored how this immune response changes with age, providing valuable information for tailoring health strategies for different age groups. University of Melbourne Dr Carolien van de Sandt, a Senior Research Fellow at the Doherty Institute and co-author of the study, said that this research gives valuable insights into age-related immune responses to influenza B viruses. “As we age, our immune system responds differently to the flu,” said Dr van de Sandt. “While we detected killer T cells that recognise influenza B viral fragments across the human lifespan, from young children to the elderly, those T cell responses substantially peaked in adults. This may help explain why this particular age group is protected from severe influenza B infections. “Our findings also showed that killer T cells that recognise influenza B viruses have a very good memory, but are not as numerous in elderly people and children. This is fascinating, as children have a higher burden from influenza B than adults and the elderly.” Professor Kedzierska explained that the clinical implications of the study are substantial, and the research presents the first step toward the development of new T cell-based influenza B vaccines. “The influenza B viral T cell targets that we have found could be included in new T cell-based vaccines, which could significantly reduce severe cases and death caused by influenza B, especially in children, and alleviate the burden of seasonal influenza epidemics,” said Professor Kedzierska. Current influenza vaccines primarily rely on antibodies that target specific strains, necessitating frequent updates due to mutations in the virus. However, the study suggests exploring T cell-based vaccine strategies, highlighting their potential to provide broad immune protection across all variants of influenza B viruses for various age groups.

The group published their findings yesterday on the preprint server bioRxiv.In other H5N1 developments, the USDA last night announced that its tests on retail ground beef from affected states were negative, and two affected states—Michigan and Colorado—announced new emergency measures.Data gaps and timeline questionsPhylogenetic analysis using genome sequencing suggests that there was a reassortment event in late 2023 between the current highly pathogenic 2.3.4.4b clade in wild birds and a low-pathogenic wild bird strain, which produced the B3.13 genotype now circulating in dairy cows.The NP gene acquired during reassortment may have played a role in the emergence in cattle, they wrote, noting that the NP gene seems to allow influenza viruses to spread more easily in pigs.Their analysis suggests there were as many as five B3.13 introductions from cattle to poultry, one to a raccoon, two to domestic cats, and three to wild birds. Though the findings track with epidemiological findings of spread through movement of herds to other states, they emphasized that there are still gaps. "We cannot exclude the possibility that this genotype is circulating in unsampled locations and hosts as the existing analysis suggests that data are missing and under surveillance may obscure transmission inferred using phylogenetic methods," they wrote. For example, they said the B3.13 virus from the human infection doesn't nest within cattle sequences, which could suggest that viruses from unsampled cows were the source of the infection or that evolution within the host was enough to result in a different phylogenetic grouping. "It is most likely, however, that asymptomatic transmission and undersurveillance in epidemiologically important populations drove this pattern."They conclude that the potential for B3.13 to become endemic in cattle will influence the zoonotic risk from the virus and warned that if the low level of mammalian adaptations they're seeing become dominant, the risk of interspecies transmission will be higher.Scientists welcome new dataAfter the group published its report, Angela Rasmussen, PhD, a virologist with the University of Saskatchewan's Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization, on X (formerly known as Twitter), praised the group for sharing the critical data.However, she said more information is needed, such as the tissue and or sample type each genome came from, which is essential for understanding how cows are transmitting the virus and planning experiments to test transmission hypotheses. "This is an all-hands situation and transparency & data access are required for an effective response," Rasmussen wrote.Michael Osterholm, PhD, MPH, who directs the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP) at the University of Minnesota, publisher of CIDRAP News, also credited the USDA group for sharing their findings and said the science community has been anxiously waiting for the critical information."This will help people better understand how the spillover unfolded," he said.Ground beef tests negative for H5N1 tracesIn its update, the USDA said it tested 30 samples of retail ground beef from states where dairy herds tested positive for H5N1. The samples underwent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, which can identify traces of the virus but not live virus, at the NVSL. All were negative."These results reaffirm that the meat supply is safe," the agency said.The USDA added that PCR testing is under way on muscle samples from culled dairy cows at selected USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) slaughter facilities and that its Agricultural Research Service is conducting a cooking study using a virus surrogate in ground beef to examine the impact of different cooking temperatures on virus levels.Michigan and Colorado announce emergency measuresTwo states affected by H5N1 outbreaks in dairy herds yesterday announced emergency measures aimed at controlling the spread of the virus.In Michigan, where recent outbreaks in dairy cows and massive outbreaks in poultry were reported across seven counties, the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (MDARD) announced an extraordinary emergency measure that requires dairy farms and commercial poultry farms to implement biosecurity steps such as designating a biosecurity manager, establish cleaning procedures, and keeping a log book of vehicles and people who have crossed farm-access points.The order also bars all lactating cattle from being displayed until the state has passed 60 days with no new dairy farm detections. Officials also announced a similar restriction for poultry, but for 30 days with no new detections.Elsewhere, Colorado's agricultural commission approved, and the state's agriculture commissioner yesterday adopted, an emergency rule designed to limit the spread of H5N1. Colorado is the most recently affected state in the outbreak involving dairy cattle, and so far, it's not clear how the cows were exposed to the virus. In its announcement, the Colorado Department of Agriculture said the emergency rule requires mandatory testing of lactating cattle moving interstate, which they said allows implementation of the recent federal order, which took effect on April 29.

What to know about the risk to humansAvian influenza, aka bird flu, has spread to dairy cows in multiple states and one person in Texas. What to know about transmission, symptoms and food risks.April 12, 2024, 3:34 PM UTC / Updated April 29, 2024, 2:27 PM UTC / Source: TODAYBy Caroline KeeAmid an outbreak of avian influenza, aka bird flu, that has spread to cows in nine states and one person in Texas, federal regulators have detected traces of the bird flu virus in pasteurized milk.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said on Thursday that about 20% of retail milk samples tested positive for viral fragments in a nationally representative survey of milk sold in the United States.However, FDA officials stressed that the inactive viral particles found in pasteurized milk do not pose a threat to consumers and that the country's milk supply remains safe.Since March, the United States has been facing an unusual outbreak of bird flu among dairy cattle. It's the first time this strain of the virus — referred to as highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) — has been detected in cows. The person who tested positive for H5N1 in Texas represents the the first instance of cow-to-human transmission of bird flu, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.It's only the second case of bird flu in a human ever reported in the U.S. There is no evidence of human-to-human transmission of this H5N1 virus so far, but health officials are on high alert.All dairy cows being transported from one farm to another across state lines must now be tested for bird flu, according to a new order issued by the U.S. Department of Agriculture on April 24.The CDC is monitoring dairy and poultry workers for the virus, and has identified 44 possible exposures so far, NBC News previously reported. No other humans have tested positive, but experts say cases are likely being missed. In a recent press conference, a top official at the World Health Organization called the risk of the bird flu spreading to humans "an enormous concern." Speaking to reporters on April 18, WHO chief scientist Dr. Jeremy Farrar warned that bird flu viruses are increasingly infecting mammals."The great concern ... is that the virus evolves and develops the ability to infect humans and then critically, the ability to go from human-to-human transmission," said Farrar.Is bird flu a problem now?The current bird flu outbreak has spread to over 30 dairy herds across the country. Although the risk to humans is considered low, health officials are calling for increased monitoring of infected animals and people exposed to them.While the thought of "bird flu" may sound alarming and stoke COVID-19 pandemic fears, influenza among birds is not new.“The current bird flu strain that we’re concerned with, H5N1, has actually been circulating around the world for quite some time,” Dr. William Schaffner, professor of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, tells TODAY.com.H5N1 is widespread among wild birds and is causing an ongoing outbreak among poultry in the U.S., per the CDC. What is bird flu?Bird flu is a disease caused by infection with avian influenza type A viruses. Avian influenza A viruses occur naturally among wild aquatic birds, such as geese, ducks and swans, says Schaffner, but they can also circulate among domestic poultry.“Bird flu viruses occasionally get into other mammalian species (like pigs). We’ve all heard of swine flu,” Schaffner says. Avian influenza A viruses can also infect horses, bats and dogs, per the CDC — rarely, they spread to humans."More recently, we have seen an increase of infections in cattle," Dr. Hilary M. Babcock, infectious disease specialist at Washington University of St. Louis and BJC Healthcare, tells TODAY.com. This is the first time the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain, which causes severe and often fatal disease in birds, has been found in cows. “That’s pretty unusual,” says Schaffner. However, this H5N1 strain does not seem to be making cows very sick, he adds.What states have bird flu?Highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (which include the strain of H5N1 that’s currently spreading) have been detected in the U.S. in wild aquatic birds, commercial poultry and backyard bird flocks beginning in January 2022, according to the CDC. Overall, 48 states have reported cases of highly pathogenic H5N1.The current outbreak of H5N1 affecting cows has spread to nine states so far, per the U.S. Department of Agriculture. As of April 22, cases have been reported among dairy herds in: TexasKansasMichiganNew MexicoIdahoOhioNorth CarolinaSouth DakotaColoradoCurrently, only one human in Texas is known to have contracted H5N1 in this outbreak, the experts say.There have been only two human cases of H5N1 in the U.S. ever, says Babcock — the first case was detected in Colorado in 2022 in a person who had direct contact with infected poultry.As H5N1 surveillance increases, experts anticipate the number of cases among cows to increase. "We’re looking harder now and finding more cases (among cattle) that even 10 years ago would have gone undetected," says Schaffner. Officials are monitoring workers who may have been exposed to sick cattle or poultry. Dr. Keith Poulsen, director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, told NBC News "there’s probably a lot of cases that are not documented.”However, the risk to the general public in the U.S. is low, the experts say. For people exposed due to their line of work, the risk is considered “low-to-moderate,” the WHO said in a statement. How does the bird flu spread to humans?"Every once in a while, a bird flu virus can get into a human, but that's rare," says Schaffner. Avian influenza viruses can spread from infected birds to humans in a few ways, according to the CDC:Directly from an infected bird From environments contaminated with avian influenza virusThrough an intermediate host, such as an animalInfected birds can shed the virus in their saliva, nasal secretions, mucus and feces. People can become infected when a large enough amount of the virus gets into the mouth, nose, eyes or is inhaled, says Schaffner.Transmission to humans typically occurs through close contact with infected birds without protective gear. It can also occur if a person touches contaminated surfaces and puts their hands in their eyes or mouth or if they breathe in droplets from the air, per the CDC.It is not immediately clear how the dairy cow infected the person in Texas, the experts note. The only other person who contracted H5N1 in the U.S. was directly involved in the culling of birds presumed to be infected with H5N1, says Babcock.Sporadic cases of H5N1 in humans have been reported around the world, often in rural areas where people live closely with poultry or other birds. According to the WHO, since 2003 there have been 889 cases and 463 deaths caused by H5N1 in 23 countries.Once the bird flu gets into a human, “it is almost never spread to anyone else,” says Schaffner. However, “there are ultra-rare instances of transmission from a person very sick with bird flu to a family member or caregiver.”No human-to-human spread has occurred with the contemporary H5N1 viruses currently spreading in birds, the CDC said. When this does happen, it does not lead to continued spread between people "because the virus doesn’t have the (genetic) capacity to spread easily from person to person,” says Schaffner.“This strain of bird flu has been around for about a decade and it still has not picked up this capacity to spread readily from person to person, thankfully. ... That should be a matter of reassurance, but also keep us in public health on alert,” says Schaffner.Can you get bird flu from drinking milk?There is no evidence that people can get bird flu from food that’s been properly prepared and cooked, and it is safe to drink pasteurized milk, the experts say. "We have not seen cases that have been from ingesting animal products or animals that may have been infected," says Babcock. In a statement, the FDA stressed that the commercial milk supply in the U.S. remains safe, but that studies on H5N1 are ongoing. The agency said it does not currently have concerns about the safety of pasteurized milk products, including pasteurized cheese.In addition to mandatory avian influenza tests for cattle moving across state lines, the USDA has ordered state veterinary labs to report all positive tests to federal authorities.The infected dairy cow herds that have been detected are in quarantine and their milk is being destroyed, says Schaffner.“The pasteurization process in the U.S. keeps our milk supply very safe,” says Babcock. Pasteurization heats the milk to a high enough temperature to kill bacteria and viruses, including influenza."Based on available information, pasteurization is likely to inactivate the virus, however the process is not expected to remove the presence of viral particles,” the FDA said. The dead virus particles in milk do not represent the actual H5N1 virus, and are unlikely to make a person sick. “If you tested most milk, you’d find E. coli and listeria and other things in it, too, but they’d all be dead. Pasteurization doesn’t take them out, it just kills them,” Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, told NBC News. Drinking unpasteurized or "raw" milk, which is increasingly trendy, is associated with various infectious disease hazards, says Schaffner. "I discourage people from drinking raw milk,” he adds. The FDA Can you get bird flu from eating eggs?The risk of humans becoming infected by eating eggs from poultry with H5N1 is low, says the FDA, and there are safeguards in place to identify infected poultry and remove their eggs from the market.It's possible for products from infected animals to end up in the food supply, says Babcock, but the risk to humans is still very low. Properly storing and cooking food further reduces that risk.Although beef cattle are not involved in this outbreak, Schaffner recommends cooking beef to a safe internal temperature. The FDA recommends cooking eggs until the white and yolk are firm. “There are other reasons that you shouldn’t eat raw eggs (or meat), because these can carry lots of different pathogens," says Babcock. What happens if a human gets the bird flu?Bird flu infections in humans can range in severity, the experts note. Some people have zero or only mild symptoms, while others develop severe disease, according to the CDC. "It can be a serious infection with a high mortality rate,” says Schaffner. The Texas patient had a mild infection, with eye redness as the only symptom, the CDC said. "It was not even a respiratory infection. It was ... conjunctivitis or pink eye," Schaffner notes.The patient was treated with flu antivirals and is recovering. "We have antiviral medications, the same ones we use to treat regular flu, that work against this avian influenza strain," Schaffner says.The other human case of H5N1 in the U.S. in 2022 was a mild infection as well, Babcock adds. Symptoms of bird flu in humansAccording to the CDC and experts, the reported signs and symptoms of avian influenza in humans include:Fever Cough Runny noseMuscle or body achesHeadacheFatigueShortness of breathEye redness or inflammation (conjunctivitis) DiarrheaNauseaBird flu in humans may look similar to a regular flu or upper respiratory infection, says Babcock, or a person may have no obvious symptoms. It can also lead to pneumonia, respiratory failure and other complications. "There's a full range," she adds.There is no way to diagnose an infection with bird flu by symptoms alone, the CDC says. Laboratory testing is required.Can you recover from bird flu?Yes, you can recover from bird flu. The human recently infected in Texas was treated with flu antivirals and is recovering. The Colorado patient infected in 2022 also recovered.Globally, bird flu symptoms have ranged from mild to severe, resulting in death in some cases, according to the CDC.How to prevent spread of bird fluAlthough the risk of getting bird flu is low, the CDC recommends the following protective actions: Avoid visiting poultry farms if possible If visiting poultry farms, wear a mask and avoid touching birds Avoid sick or dead birdsMaintain good hand hygieneDo not eat raw or undercooked poultry Visit a doctor if you become sick after contact with birdsCaroline KeeCaroline Kee is a health reporter at TODAY based in New York City.RelatedCostcoCostco recalls nearly 80,000 pounds of butter — and you’ll never guess whyRecall / Updated Nov. 11, 2024Getty ImagesWhat is the healthiest cheese?

It is near the end of flu season. As the weather improves and we are outdoors more, that will decrease one’s risk factor for the transmission of viruses such as flu.”Dr. Glen Clark -- Emergency Center Chief, Corewell Health’s Beaumont Hospital Grosse Pointe“We’re seeing a lot of viral gastroenteritis (the stomach flu). We’re also seeing the occasional COVID and influenza cases still, but much less in the last few weeks.”Oakland County – Seasonal allergies, asthma flare-ups, sinus infections, stomach viruses, influenza, COVIDDr. Matthew Compton -- Chief of Emergency Medicine at DMC Huron Valley-Sinai Hospital.“We’re definitely transitioning to warmer weather and seeing decreases in respiratory infections. We’re also seeing Increasing numbers of primarily minor trauma from outdoor activities. We’re not yet seeing boating-related visits, which tend to start going up as people put their boats in the water at our many lakes in the area. Please enjoy the water safely.”Dr. Steve McGraw -- Director of Emergency Medicine, Ascension Providence Hospital, Southfield and Novi Campuses“I’m still seeing patients with spring illnesses like allergies, Viral sinus infections, gastroenteritis, and asthma flare-ups with thetemperature fluctuations and budding trees/pollens/grasses. The flu is present but dwindling like COVID-19. This is a reminder for everyone to take care and watch for cyclists and pedestrians as the temperatures warm up. Everyone should wear a helmet while bike riding.”Dr. Rena Daiza -- Primary Care Physician, Henry Ford Medical Center Bloomfield Twp.“This week, there have been many sports-related injuries in the office. As the weather improves, there are more outdoor activities including sports. Reminder to take precautions with activity including warm-ups and cool-downs, use proper techniques, wear protective gear as needed, and know when to rest.”Dr. Sanford Vieder -- Emergency Center Chief, Corewell Health Hospital Farmington Hills“It appears the worst of both COVID and influenza are behind us. With spring in Michigan finally here, it seems, we continue to see some of the negative impacts of environmental allergens on those with chronic respiratory issues, such as asthma and emphysema. For those who suffer with seasonal allergies, we continue to encourage preventative therapy programs, but if significant symptoms persist, a primary care physician can help initiate advanced treatment. Additionally, we are keeping a close eye on national concerns regards to bird flu, though thankfully, we have not seen any local cases as of yet.”Washtenaw County – Seasonal allergies, COPD & asthma flare-ups, stomach viruses, upper respiratory infections, COVID, influenzaDr. Brad Uren -- Clinical Associate Professor of Emergency Medicine, Michigan Medicine“Much less URIs, covid, and flu this week. A little bit of GI illness still in circulation on the adult side. Recent high pollen counts have continued to cause problems for people that are susceptible such as those with COPD, asthma, etc.”Washtenaw County Health Department“Influenza cases in Washtenaw County residents are currently at high levels, but appear to be decreasing. Most Influenza cases being reported in Washtenaw County are Influenza A, types A(H1N1) and A(H3). Sporadic cases of Influenza B are being reported. Influenza-related deaths in Washtenaw County adults have been reported this flu season. All individuals were older adults with confirmed Influenza A infection. Flu-related hospitalizations of Washtenaw residents are currently at high levels, but appear to be decreasing.”Monroe County – Influenza, COVID viral illnesses, stomach viruses, seasonal allergiesProMedica Monroe Regional Hospital – Emergency Center“We are seeing an increase in influenza A, COVID-19, and viral illnesses. Patients are also coming in with chest pain, nausea/vomiting, and fall-related injuries.”Macomb County – Seasonal allergies, stomach viruses, strep throat, upper respiratory viruses, pneumoniaDr. Melissa Rivers -- Emergency physician at McLaren Macomb“Notable for its lateness in the traditional season, several patients have been diagnoses with pneumonia after experiencing a deep, persistent cough, shallow breathing, and fever. The upturn in weather has started the allergy season and has caused sufferers to experience congestion, sneezing, and trouble breathing. While testing negative for the flu, COVID, and RSV, viral upper respirating infections continue to cause similar symptoms of congestion, runny nose, and slight fever. Along with the spring weather has come an increase in patients suffering orthopedic injuries sustained in outdoor activities.”Henry Ford-GoHealth Urgent Care“We have seen an increase in seasonal allergies. We also are seeing viral gastroenteritis, bacterial pharyngitis (strep throat) and viral upper respiratory infections.”Livingston County -- Did not report this weekCopyright 2024 by WDIV ClickOnDetroit - All rights reserved.About the AuthorsSarah Mayberry, M.P.H. headshotSarah Mayberry, M.P.H.emailFrank McGeorge, MD headshotFrank McGeorge, MDDr. McGeorge can be seen on Local 4 News helping Metro Detroiters with health concerns when he isn't helping save lives in the emergency room at Henry Ford Hospital.emailClick here to take a moment and familiarize yourself with our Community Guidelines.Loading...Recommended VideosTV ListingsEmail NewslettersRSS FeedsContests and RulesContact UsCareers at WDIVClosed Captioning / Audio DescriptionPublic FileTerms of UsePrivacy PolicyDo Not Sell My InfoFCC ApplicationsCookie PreferencesFollow UsVisit our YouTube page (opens in a new tab)Visit our Facebook page (opens in a new tab)Visit our Instagram page (opens in a new tab)Visit our X page (opens in a new tab)Visit our RSS Feed page (opens in a new tab)Get Results With OmneIf you need help with the Public File, call (313) 222-0556.At WDIV, we are committed to informing and delighting our audience.

A new vaccine from Duke helps the immune system target the stalk of the hemagglutinin protein, rather than its top. [U.S. Centers for Disease Control] The search for a universal flu vaccine has been long and fraught with false starts and dead ends. For more than five years, Nicholas Heaton, PhD, associate professor of molecular genetics and microbiology at Duke University, has been working with his team on a systematic approach to create such a vaccine. One particularly promising approach is to develop antibodies that target both the head and stalk of the most abundant surface protein on the influenza virus. The group’s new study, entitled, “Vaccination with Antigenically Complex Hemagglutinin Mixtures Confers Broad Protection From Influenza Disease,” was published in Science Translational Medicine. Flu is widespread and deadly, with anywhere from 9–41 million cases annually, resulting in approximately 5–51,000 thousand deaths a year in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The severity of flu infections is as variable as the strains that cause the disease. Each strain is typically characterized and referred to by alphanumeric codes including the letters H (hemagglutinin) and N (neuraminidase), identifying the most prominent surface proteins, and numbers to delimit the protein variant. The influenza virus contains about 5–10 times more hemagglutinin than neuraminidase, said Heaton. Current annual vaccines typically target the globular head of the lollipop-shaped hemagglutinin glycoprotein or neuraminidase proteins coating the virus. These proteins are highly mutable, resulting in the need to create new vaccines annually. “The virus has evolved to have the immune system recognize these (features on the head region). But these are the shapes the virus can change. That is an insidious strategy,” Heaton said. Furthermore, due to the sheer quantity of flu strains, only some of them are included in each year’s flu shot. For decades, researchers have sought out strategies to circumvent the rapid incessant evolution of flu strains. These strategies have varied from focusing on neuraminidase, to using stalk-targeting nanoparticles, or using live, genetically altered viruses. To broaden the function of flu vaccines, Heaton’s team now reports the development of “an antigenically complex mixture of recombinant hemagglutinins designed to redirect immune responses to more conserved domains of the protein.” Asked how this approach is different from previous efforts, Heaton told GEN, “I think that all (including ours) have their pros and cons.” As there are more hemagglutinin than neuraminidase molecules on the flu virus surface, the team focused their efforts on identifying regions of that protein that were less likely to mutate over time. “A number of groups have gone through and experimentally mutagenized the whole hemagglutinin and asked, ‘Which areas can change and still allow the hemagglutinin to function?’” Heaton explained. “The answer is, you can’t really change the stalk and expect it to continue to function.” “Antibodies against the stalk work differently,” Heaton explained. “Their mechanism of protection is not necessarily to block the first step of infection. So our idea was: What if we can come up with a vaccine that gives us both? What if we can get good head antibodies and at the same time also get stalk antibodies in case the vaccine selection was wrong, or if there’s a pandemic?” First, Heaton’s team aimed to create a group of mutated hemagglutinin proteins with a wide variety of mutations only in the head region, but with conserved stalks. They used gene editing techniques to create more than 80,000 variants of hemagglutinin with changes just in the head region after purification and sequencing procedures. They next verified that the mutated region was not prone to antibody recognition compared to the wildtype, suggesting that they had successfully generated a mutant protein mixture that could be used for vaccine creation. They then tested their mixture in animal models—mice and ferrets—to determine the antibody response. “If we took your blood to see if you are likely to be protected from a strain of flu, we’d be measuring what your antibodies do to hemagglutinin as the best metric of what’s likely to happen to you. The strongest correlates of protection have to do with hemagglutinin-directed immunity,” Heaton explained. Following this premise, the team found that animals vaccinated with the experimental mixture produced more antibodies against conserved stalk regions compared with controls. “One thing that we observed was enhanced vaccine-induced responses to both the head and stalk domain of the hemagglutinin,” Heaton told GEN. “That has been a difficult goal to achieve.” There are many avenues of further study ahead. “One of the most important next steps will be to understand if we can apply this approach to all of the different subtypes of influenza that infect humans. In this paper, we only study H1N1 viruses,” Heaton told GEN. Translating this data to humans will be a much larger hurdle. Heaton concluded, “There are many challenges in the advanced development of a vaccine. One major challenge is predicting how different people (with different immune exposure histories) will respond to the vaccine. That is very hard to model in a laboratory environment.” InsightsAntibody responseGlycoproteinInfluenza vaccineInfluenza virusMedical geneticsMice Share FacebookTwitterLinkedinReddItEmail Previous articleMalaria Transmission Could Be Prevented by Blocking Parasite’s Sexual Development GenesNext articleVendor-Agnostic Automation for Cell and Gene Therapy Manufacturing Corinna Singleman, PhD Also of Interest Ketogenic Diet Shapes Gut Microbiota to Protect from Autoimmunity in Mice Wet AMD Treatments Could Work Better If Both VEGF and ANGPTL4 Are Targeted Leveraging Flow Cytometry to Accelerate Research Using Humanized Immune System Mice Cancer Biomarker Potential "Seen" in Extracellular Vesicles Prostate Cancer Progression in Mice Halted by Pro-Oxidant Supplement Heart Attack Model Suggests Therapeutic Role for Repair Protein GPNMB Related Media The Problem with Lab Mice Optical Defibrillation Improving Brain Plasticity A Brief History of Stem Cells Related Content Ketogenic Diet Shapes Gut Microbiota to Protect from Autoimmunity in Mice Wet AMD Treatments Could Work Better If Both VEGF and ANGPTL4 Are Targeted Leveraging Flow Cytometry to Accelerate Research Using Humanized Immune System Mice Cancer Biomarker Potential “Seen” in Extracellular Vesicles Read the Digital Edition ExploreAbout GEN Contact GEN GEN Staff Editorial Guidelines Reprints and Permissions Scientific Advisory Board AdvertiseMedia Kit and Planning Calendar Advertising Terms and Conditions ResourcesGet the GEN Magazine Get the GEN Email Newsletter Inside Precision Medicine Privacy Policy Copyright © 2024 Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology News.

But in recent weeks, the virus has begun infecting U.S. dairy cows: the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported sick animals in at least 34 herds as of April 26. And a human case involving a dairy worker in Texas has ramped up concerns that the virus, known as H5N1, could spread more widely in people. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has announced it will test ground beef in states with outbreaks as a precaution, although the virus is thought to spread through close contact with infected animals.With COVID’s rapid development into a lethal pandemic still fresh in many people’s mind, it’s difficult to know how worried we should be about another infectious respiratory disease gaining ground. So Scientific American spoke with Katelyn Jetelina, an independent epidemiologist who writes a popular public health newsletter, about how the outbreak has gone so far and how the U.S. could strengthen its management—which she says began as “a very uncoordinated, messy response.”[An edited transcript of the interview follows.]On supporting science journalismIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing.

H5N1 has been really heating up in the past two or three years, but what makes the past couple of months unique is that this is spreading among cows.The mantra we always work on is that spillovers are common, but pandemics are rare because so many unlucky things have to happen in sequence. But pandemics are a game of roulette: they rely on luck, and they can get dramatic pretty fast.Are we repeating the mistakes of the early days of COVID?There are things we’ve learned and things we haven’t learned. One of the biggest challenges with this is: it involves humans and animals, so there are a lot of players—we have multiple agencies working in their lane. I’ve been impressed with how the CDC has been updating the public, and I hope that’s because they learned their lesson during COVID. Other players haven’t necessarily learned those lessons because they weren’t in the COVID trenches.One key difference [with bird flu] is: this hasn’t seen human-to-human spread. We’re not talking about January through March 2020. I do think that we are watching this unfold in real time better than we did with COVID, which seemed to be coming out of nowhere, so that gives me a little more hope.How have scientists been tracking the spread of bird flu in cows?We don’t have a good sense of the spread because testing is voluntary and certainly not being done in a systematic way. We’re pretty much flying blind with the testing aspect.But we have had two clues that this virus has spread very widely: The Food and Drug Administration found viral fragments in milk. And genomic surveillance estimates that spillover to dairy cows started back in December 2023, if not earlier, which means this has been spreading under our noses for a much longer time than we originally thought.That means our surveillance systems are not great. It also means we haven’t been testing enough. We don’t think that this means the virus is being spread to humans, but it may mean that H5N1 is starting to find a new host in cows, which would not be great news.Should people be worried about getting the H5N1 virus from milk?It sounds scary, and I understand the concern. One thing that has made me calm down is knowing that we’ve had, like, 100 years of data around pasteurization, and it works really well. We also got confirmation that scientists were not able to grow active virus from the milk samples, which were pasteurized. That means these virus fragments detected in milk were broken pieces that cannot replicate and thus cannot harm humans. This is a good sign.Do we know how the virus jumped into cows or how it’s spreading?From the genomic surveillance, it looks like the spread to cows was likely from one source—probably a dead bird. One hypothesis is that the virus got into cow feed, and then cows ate it, and then it started spreading from cow to cow through the milk machines. But a lot of this is still up in the air.Veterinarians swabbing cows have found the most virus in the udders, but they have found other positive swabs from, for example, lung tissue. So how is this actually spreading? We think it’s the milk machines spreading the virus from cow to cow, but we need to make sure that it’s not via respiratory transmission as well.A huge new puzzle is that there is also transmission from cows to poultry. That is concerning; it gives this virus even more opportunity to adapt because it keeps jumping from species to species, and we don’t know how. Is it through humans? Is it through rats? Is it through feed? We don’t know. Trying to get a really good understanding of epidemiology here has been challenging just because the data are limited, and the communication is suboptimal.The CDC says there has only been one case in humans from this outbreak. How plausible is that?I’m a little skeptical because we haven’t been doing asymptomatic testing, and symptomatic testing is voluntary. There have been reports this week that there are other humans who had symptoms who didn’t test.Until we start seeing data, I don’t think we should come to sweeping conclusions that it’s only one human case. The good news is that it doesn’t seem like anyone’s died yet, and we’re not seeing huge clusters [of sick people] in emergency departments. So if there are more human cases, I’m pretty confident they’re from direct contact with cows rather than human-to-human transmission. But we need more data and more communication around this.Many people who have close contact with cows are migrant workers, some of whom are likely undocumented. Does that make them less likely to report any flu symptoms?Yeah, there are so many layers to this. If they test positive, they’re not going to be able to work, and that has huge implications for their family. The other two big challenges that the CDC brought up publicly are that there’s a language barrier and that some of these people are undocumented workers with a lack of trust in government institutions.Are we monitoring the virus in wastewater like we did for the virus that causes COVID?One huge lesson we learned during the COVID pandemic is the value of wastewater. This is a perfect case to leverage this massive network that we built to try and figure out how and where H5N1 is spreading, given the limitations and biases of testing right now. What’s been disappointing is that the government has not officially shared any [flu data from] wastewater. To monitor human infections, the CDC said that they’re utilizing emergency department data, which is great. But once an outbreak hits emergency departments among humans, it’s already kind of out of control, so I would love to see wastewater surveillance leveraged a whole lot more.If we need vaccines and treatments for bird flu, how prepared are we?The government has confirmed that tools such as Tamiflu [an antiviral medication] would work to a certain extent against H5N1. Of course, Tamiflu is not very effective even against our seasonal flu. We also have stockpiled H5N1 vaccines that are predicted to have efficacy if this does move to humans, which is great news. [Editor’s Note: These vaccines require two doses per person. The U.S. government says it has some 10 million doses available and could make about 125 million or so within four months, which would total enough to cover about one fifth of the country.]But there are still a lot of unanswered questions: What about manufacturing and supply? What about the rest of the globe? What about vaccine hesitancy and declining trust and access problems? Fully relying on vaccines and overconfidence were some of the biggest mistakes of the COVID emergency, and I think it’s best to face these threats and questions with a level of humility and determination.When should people who work with livestock get access to those vaccines?I don’t know what that line is, when we’re like, “This is an ‘oh, shit’ moment” versus a “watch and see moment.” Getting that line incorrect has massive implications. Certainly if we start seeing any trace of human-to-human transmission, we would really need to start ramping up. If we start seeing transmission in pigs, that would make me incredibly nervous. Pigs are a really great mixing vessel for influenza, so it would be incredibly easy for this virus to start mutating in a way that would have implications for humans. Veterinarians are continuing to test pigs for H5N1, and they have so far been negative, so I’m really happy we’re on top of that.What’s missing from the U.S.’s H5N1 response right now?We need a coordinated response from our government. I get that there are multiple players who have their own priorities and legal authorities, but honest, frequent, direct communication earns the public’s trust and confidence. When communities are starved for good information during outbreaks, it leads to unnecessary anxiety, confusion and frustration. The winds may be changing in this area, but we need to get better faster.On the ground, we really need to get a handle on where H5N1 is spreading and how. That comes through asymptomatic testing of animals and people, sharing genomic surveillance data with the global community and understanding wastewater trends. So certainly, a lot more work needs to be done.How worried should people be right now?This is not a concern for the average American unless they’re working with a livestock. What I tell my mom, for example, is that the general public doesn’t have to worry. This is very low-risk to them at the moment. But that could change.I think the most we can do is to know that this is going on and to pay attention to the status of the situation by finding trusted sources of information. There is so much misinformation and disinformation that finding and sticking to those credible sources is going to be incredibly important if this situation continues to evolve, which we expect it to.Rights & PermissionsMeghan Bartels is a science journalist based in New York City.

In March 2024, the cage-free flock was reported at about 40 percent (124.8 million layers) of the U.S. flock. However, a wave of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in egg-laying hens in late 2023 reduced the inventory of cage-free eggs into February 2024. An estimated 13.6 million birds, both cage-free and caged, were depopulated following an outbreak spanning November 2023 to January 2024. This depopulation included about 4 million hens from California’s cage-free flock. California laws require its retailers to source eggs from cage-free layers regardless of the State of origin. To make up for the shortfall, cage-free eggs from other States were shipped to the California market. The resulting spike in demand prompted the advertised national average retail price for cage-free eggs to peak at $5.26 per dozen on January 12, 2024. Weekly wholesale prices for eggs in California increased to a high of $5.59 per dozen in the following weeks. U.S. inventories of cage-free eggs have since recovered, up from their low the week of January 22, 2024, and continued to climb into April 2024. Prices of cage-free eggs have also returned to a typical range.

Skip menu FAQ about avian flu In this topic Open "In this topic" menu Avian flu (avian influenza, also known as bird flu) is a contagious disease primarily found in birds. Sometimes the virus also infects mammals. Avian flu is almost never found in humans. Various influenza viruses that can cause avian flu have been observed worldwide. Avian flu, migratory birds and variants Avian flu affects the respiratory system (nose, mouth and airways), digestive system and/or nervous system. The disease occurs in poultry raised on farms (chickens, ducks and turkeys) and nearly all species of birds found in the wild, including ducks, doves, pigeons, geese, seagulls and storks. Birds of prey and other predators can also contract the virus by eating birds that fell ill or died of avian flu. The Netherlands is a major waystation for migratory birds. Almost all birds that migrate pass through the Netherlands, often touching down and sometimes staying for extended periods. This applies to hundreds of millions of birds every year. Migratory birds can carry the virus, bringing new variants of avian flu with them to the Netherlands. High and low pathogenicity Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) is deadly to birds. Since poultry farms usually keep the birds close together, outbreaks at such locations affect many birds at once. Wild birds can also contract the highly pathogenic variants. Low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) causes minimal or no symptoms in birds. Read more about these different types of avian flu (in Dutch) on the website of the Netherlands Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority (NVWA). Avian flu in birds Birds that contract a highly pathogenic variant become ill very soon after infection. The first symptoms often appear within a few hours after exposure, or up to 3 days later. In these cases, the disease is fatal. The first symptoms are: lethargy no longer making sounds The birds may also develop other symptoms, such as: breathing problems diarrhoea closed and runny eyes unusual head movements, often twisting sudden death Field tests with poultry vaccination In autumn 2023, the Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality (LNV) launched a field test for vaccinating poultry. 1800 newly hatched chicks were vaccinated against highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza. The field test will continue until the end of 2025. Read more about avian flu (in Dutch) on the website of the Netherlands Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority (NVWA), or consult the international information provided by the World Health Organization. Avian flu in humans In rare cases, avian influenza viruses can be transmitted from animals to humans. This only happens after extended close contact between humans and infected animals (birds or mammals). It is not very likely that humans will contract avian flu, based on the virus variants that are currently circulating. If a person is infected, they will often develop minimal symptoms, or none at all. If they do become ill, their symptoms are usually similar to ‘ordinary’ flu: fever, headache, muscle aches and coughing. People with avian flu sometimes also develop an eye infection. It is very unlikely that someone with avian flu will infect other people. Avian flu in humans does not always cause a mild course of illness. Some types of avian influenza, especially in Asia, can sometimes make people very ill. In these cases, they cause severe pneumonia or shortness of breath. Preventing avian flu Do not touch dead birds in the wild If you see a dead bird out in the wild, do not touch it! Report the dead bird to the Dutch Wildlife Health Centre (DWHC) or SOVON. Dead bird in the garden or on the balcony? Is there a dead bird in your garden or on your balcony? Then you can report the dead bird to the Dutch Wildlife Health Centre (DWHC) or SOVON. If you dispose of the bird yourself, make sure to use disposable gloves or a plastic bag to lift the bird and throw it away. Place the bird inside a closed bag before tossing into the trash. Also throw the gloves away after use, and scrub your hands with soap and water. More information on this topic is available on the DWHC website. If you think you might have become ill from the avian influenza virus, after touching a sick bird or other animal, contact your GP. Mention that you were in contact with a sick animal. How common is avian flu? Until winter 2021, there were avian flu outbreaks every few years at poultry farms in the Netherlands, which occurred in the winter months. During the winter months in 2021, a high number of farms reported infections, breaking from the previous trend. Since then, there have been avian flu outbreaks among poultry all year round. There has been a striking increase in avian flu among waterfowl in the Netherlands. Birds that nest in colonies have been hit hardest. Avian flu has become a pandemic among these birds, affecting very high numbers of waterfowl worldwide. See the website of the Netherlands Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority (NVWA) for details on the current situation (in Dutch). Risks of avian flu for cats and dogs Sometimes the avian influenza virus can be transmitted to mammals living in the wild, such as foxes, ferrets and seals, and to household pets like cats and dogs. They are usually exposed to the virus by eating an infected animal (live or dead) or picking it up in their mouth. There have been no confirmed cases of transmission from cat or dog to humans. Do you suspect that your cat or dog has become ill after contact with a dead or potentially ill bird? Contact your vet. Keep dogs leashed around dead birds, or if dead birds have been found in your area.

USDA will test ground beef for H5N1 avian influenza viruses. Natalia Semenova/iStockphoto/Getty Images CNN — Food safety officials say they are testing beef, including ground beef from grocery stores, for the presence of the H5N1 bird flu virus that’s spreading in dairy cattle. The United States Department of Agriculture said on Monday that it is conducting three separate beef safety studies. The agency is sampling ground beef purchased at grocery stores in states where dairy cattle have tested positive for the H5N1 avian influenza virus. It is also taking samples of muscle tissue from sick cows that have been culled from their herd. Finally, they’re conducting cooking studies, which will inoculate ground beef with a “virus surrogate” and cook it to different temperatures to see how much virus is killed under each heat setting. The move comes as one country, Colombia, placed restrictions on beef and beef products coming from US states where dairy herds have tested positive for avian influenza. Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Friday from the CNN Health team. The US Beef Export Foundation said the restrictions “have no scientific basis.” The US is the largest supplier of beef to Colombia, accounting for about $40 million last year, the foundation said. The USDA is testing beef with polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, testing, a highly sensitive lab test that can pick up even traces of inert genetic material from the virus, if any is present. Any positive samples will be further evaluated for live virus, USDA said. “USDA is confident that the meat supply is safe. USDA has a rigorous meat inspection process” and “multiple safeguards in place to protect consumers,” the agency said in a statement sent to media outlets on Monday. “We recommend consumers properly handle raw meats and cook to a safe internal temperature,” which kills bacteria and viruses in meat, the agency added.

Here’s why By Helen Branswell May 3, 2024 Reprints Bird flu particles NIAID Vivien Dugan isn’t getting much sleep these days. The director of the influenza division at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dugan is leading the team of CDC scientists that is working with partners — in the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Food and Drug Administration, and state and local health departments — to respond to the H5N1 bird flu outbreak in dairy cattle.advertisement The response has been pedal to the metal since the USDA announced on March 25 that a strange illness that had been affecting milk production in some herds since early this year was caused by bird flu. Since then, 36 herds in nine states have tested positive for the virus. Assessing the risk from the situation and messaging it to the public is a balancing act, she admitted. While workers on affected dairy farms are being exposed to the virus — one has tested positive so far — for the individual American elsewhere, the risk is low, for the moment. Demetre Daskalakis, director of CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases — in which the flu division is housed — said Wednesday that 25 people have been tested for H5N1 in the context of this outbreak, and over 100 people have been monitored for symptoms because they were believed to have been exposed. Related: Republicans, concerned about dairy industry, urge calm about H5N1 bird flu The responding agencies have long experience working with poultry farmers, who’ve been plagued by this virus for the past couple of years. But its move into cattle has been like crossing into a new country for the agencies. Dairy farmers have no experience with bird flu. Many farmers and farm workers haven’t been eager to cooperate with authorities.advertisement In an ideal world, blood samples from people who had contact with the infected farm worker would have been studied to look for H5N1 antibodies to see if he transmitted the virus to anyone, a technique called a serology study. But Dugan said she believes that the people involved wouldn’t grant permission. STAT asked Dugan about the work the CDC is doing, the complaints from scientists globally about the amount of information the United States has been sharing, and where the needle on her H5N1 risk meter sits right now. As we spoke, a colorful statue of a rooster was visible ​​on a credenza behind her — apt decor for a flu researcher. The interview has been edited for length and clarity. The numbers of people tested and/or monitored seems to be implausibly low, given the numbers of workers who would have been exposed to the infected animals. How hard is the U.S. looking for cases? Vivien Dugan, director of the CDC’s influenza division. CDC We had a team pretty much ready to go six weeks ago, when this first really started to show up on our radar. But this is not the average poultry-worker response situation. These are dairy farms. The poultry space and poultry industry, they’ve been responding to H5 for the past 2 ½ years, really. There’ve been more than 8,000 people that have been monitored for symptoms in the H5 poultry space. It’s a different environment altogether when we’re talking about dairy cattle and dairy farms. That said, we are really thinking about how we would go about doing the investigation we would normally do for a novel flu case — where they’re all nationally notifiable infections in people — in a way that makes scientific and epidemiological sense. The states are really focusing on that, really trying to get as much information as they can. So it’s really more in that local space. We’re supporting them in that effort. Some states have been able to contact workers directly and actively monitor. Others, of course, have not been as successful. Related: From sewage to safety: Hospital wastewater surveillance as a beacon for defense against H5N1 bird flu So it’s a work in progress. We have a couple of potential locations that we’re trying to do more with in getting the logistics sorted out. But no studies have been completed yet. No studies have been completed yet. Have any studies started? That’s probably a good question for some of the impacted states. We don’t want to get ahead of them for any work they may be doing that we don’t have all the details on. It sounds like your team that was ready to go didn’t go. And it sounds like from what you’re telling me that CDC is very much in the back seat on this one. That it’s the states or local authorities who are running this. They have the authority, right? CDC does not have the authority to go into a state. We have to have an invite from state public health. Have any states invited CDC in? No. Not officially yet. We’re speaking to these partners if not once a day, more than that. There are a lot of sensitivities. There are a lot of things that we as public health officials may not be aware of in thinking about dairy farms. We’re used to working with poultry farms and poultry workers where they’re culling all the birds. These cows are not being culled. So it’s a very different space. Related: What we’re starting to learn about H5N1 in cows, and the risk to people We’re working very closely with the state public health partners, where potentially they might be a lead of a study. And we would be in the background supporting. Sometimes we don’t need to deploy a team, we can equip our state public health partners to do the information gathering and work collaboratively with them to do that. There has been a single human case in Texas. Has anybody done serology testing around that individual? That would be an obvious place to start, would it not? I don’t know that that was consented to. You have to have consent from people to follow up. Certainly it was something that was on our radar for what we would like to have and request, but to my knowledge, serology was not performed. (A report on the case published Friday in the New England Journal of Medicine confirmed Dugan’s belief. The infected person and his contacts would not consent to have blood drawn.) The scientific world has been watching H5 for a long time. CDC has been very involved in that. And whenever there have been unusual outbreaks, this country has always pushed for rapid case finding and data sharing. I’m hearing from people outside the United States that when the shoe is on the other foot, when the outbreak is here, they’re not seeing the information sharing that they would hope for, or even evidence that the work that is crucial to finding out whether or not this could get seeded into the human population is happening. Do you have any response to that? It’s a complicated situation as far as [there are] new partners and new individuals and a different group of farm workers. We’re doing everything we can and thinking about messaging, multilingual messages, communications, PPE [personal protective equipment], biosecurity on farms, and collaboration with USDA to really protect workers. That is definitely one of our highest priorities, and it always is. But also we’re really thinking about this in the medium and longer term of what allowing a virus to circulate within a new mammalian host could mean. I don’t think anybody really can predict what might happen, but we certainly know flu viruses change. And we do not want to give the virus that opportunity, if we can avoid it. By the way, I think you need to add to your statue collection. The chicken needs a cow. Yeah. On data sharing, we are trying to be as forthcoming and as transparent as we can with the data that we have. I think we’re doing that in the “Spotlights” that we’re putting out every Friday. We got the Texas human virus sequence out as quickly as we could. So I think we’re trying to do that as much as we can. We can always do more. But a lot of this, again, is our partnerships with the states. We defer to them. We have to be behind the scenes and let them talk about what’s going on in their state. Can I ask about your personal read on the risk here? If this virus gets seeded into the cow population and it evolves in cows, what do you think this does to the human risk from H5N1? [Dugan grimaced.] I think it would definitely impact the risk, for sure. Our current assessment of the risk to the general public health is low. That could change. And so I think we’re remaining very vigilant — if anything, more vigilant in this space. Newsletters Sign up for Morning Rounds Understand how science, health policy, and medicine shape the world every day Please enter a valid email address. Privacy Policy These viruses change. If this were to become seeded in cows and become a cow-endemic virus, it certainly would increase that risk to people. And certainly our pandemic planning [operation] has been really thinking about this and trying to be as vigilant as we can now, to try and understand not just current risk, but the future risk so that we’re as prepared as we can be. But the risk could be quite big. You said you still think the risk is low. But 15 years ago this spring, CDC was notified about two kids from California who had tested positive for swine flu who hadn’t had exposure to pigs or each other. Before April 17, 2009, the risk of a swine flu pandemic would have seemed pretty low. And then CDC got those two samples, and everything changed really fast. Do you think about that? Well, yeah. It’s probably why I’m not sleeping very much right now. I think that the threat of a pandemic is always looming in the flu space. The way that Dan Jernigan [Dugan’s predecessor] always described public health to me is that it is an art form. There’s a balance that you have to strike. There’s a difference in the pandemic risk versus the immediate risk right now. And so I think that’s what we’re trying to message to the average person who is walking about and living their lives. The risk to them is low. But you’re right. It could absolutely change.

All of the affected layer operations were in Ionia County, with the smallest of the three involving more than 1.9 million hens.The three turkey operations were in Gratiot, Ottawa and Newaygo counties. The Gratiot County flock was the smallest of the three, while the Ottawa County flock had the most with about 104,000 turkeys.Prior to April, the last time Michigan had a commercial flock affected by HPAI was December 27, 2023.So far during the 2022-24 outbreak, Michigan has lost nine commercial poultry flocks. In 2023, the state lost two flocks, which collectively involved 78,900 birds. In 2022, Michigan had one flock of 35,100 birds affected.The H5N1 virus has not only been present in poultry operations in Michigan, but also in commercial dairy operations in the state.According to APHIS, between March 29 and April 17, six Michigan dairy herds have been affected by the virus. APHIS did not disclose the counties where these bovine cases were confirmed, but the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development has identified the following counties: Ottawa, Ionia, Isabella and Montcalm.To learn more about HPAI cases in commercial poultry flocks in the United States, Mexico and Canada, see an interactive map on WATTPoultry.com.

The study identifies endothelial cells, which form the blood-brain barrier, as the primary entry points for the virus.The team found that traditional antivirals that block viral replication were ineffective against this mode of invasion, but those that inhibit viral protein synthesis showed promise in reducing symptoms and mortality in a mouse model. This breakthrough offers potential new treatment avenues for IAE and similar viral encephalopathies.Key Fact:Influenza-associated encephalopathy (IAE) is a serious brain disorder caused when the flu virus breaches the blood-brain barrier.The research highlights endothelial cells as the virus’s entry point into the brain, with traditional antivirals proving ineffective in treating this invasion.Antivirals targeting viral protein synthesis showed effectiveness in a mouse model, suggesting a new treatment strategy for IAE.Source: Osaka UniversityIt might start simply, with a cough or sneeze…but in some cases, the flu virus can make its way to your brain, causing serious symptoms or even death through a disease known as influenza-associated encephalopathy (IAE).Now, in a study published in Acta Neuropathologica, researchers have revealed that IAE may be caused by the virus entering the brain through a specific cell type, and have identified possible treatment strategies. Furthermore, the researchers noticed that the virus wasn’t actually reproducing within these endothelial cells—but there were a lot of proteins made by the virus. Credit: Neuroscience NewsAlthough IAE is increasingly common, surprisingly little is known about how the influenza virus actually gets into the brain and causes symptoms of encephalopathy (a general term for brain disorders).Notably, a definitive treatment for IAE remains lacking, something that researchers from Osaka University wanted to address.To study how influenza viruses might cause IAE, the research team used a range of methods. As well as looking for virus particles in the brains of people who died from IAE, they created a mouse model of the disease by injecting influenza A virus into the blood. They also used cell culture methods to look at how well the virus infects different cell types.“In the human brains, the virus-injected mice, and the cultured cells, the influenza virus tended to accumulate in endothelial cells,” explains lead author of the study Shihoko Kimura-Ohba. “These cells create a barrier between the blood and the brain, and are important for protecting the brain from harmful substances.”Accordingly, in both the human brains and the mouse model, the barrier between the blood and the brain was compromised. Furthermore, the researchers noticed that the virus wasn’t actually reproducing within these endothelial cells—but there were a lot of proteins made by the virus.“When we saw this viral protein accumulation in the brain, we realized that antiviral medications aimed at stopping viral proliferation were unlikely to help,” says Tomonori Kimura, senior author of the study. “However, antivirals aimed at stopping viral transcription and translation—vital processes for making proteins—are also available.”When the team tried these classes of antivirals in endothelial cells treated with influenza virus, they observed less viral proteins and cell death. In the mouse model of IAE, these antivirals were also very effective when used early enough, suggesting that they may be useful in human patients.Given that many different kinds of viruses, including COVID-19, can cause encephalopathy, these findings have wide-ranging impacts. Moreover, although IAE care is improving, more than half of all patients die or have long-lasting symptoms.A better understanding of how viruses can cause encephalopathy will be important for developing new, effective treatments.About this neurology and virology research newsAuthor: Saori ObayashiSource: Osaka UniversityContact: Saori Obayashi – Osaka UniversityImage: The image is credited to Neuroscience NewsOriginal Research: Open access.“Viral entry and translation in brain endothelia provoke influenza-associated encephalopathy” by Shihoko Kimura-Ohba et al. Acta NeuropathologicaAbstractViral entry and translation in brain endothelia provoke influenza-associated encephalopathyInfluenza-associated encephalopathy (IAE) is extremely acute in onset, with high lethality and morbidity within a few days, while the direct pathogenesis by influenza virus in this acute phase in the brain is largely unknown. Here we show that influenza virus enters into the cerebral endothelium and thereby induces IAE.Three-weeks-old young mice were inoculated with influenza A virus (IAV). Physical and neurological scores were recorded and temporal-spatial analyses of histopathology and viral studies were performed up to 72 h post inoculation.Histopathological examinations were also performed using IAE human autopsy brains. Viral infection, proliferation and pathogenesis were analyzed in cell lines of endothelium and astrocyte. The effects of anti-influenza viral drugs were tested in the cell lines and animal models.Upon intravenous inoculation of IAV in mice, the mice developed encephalopathy with brain edema and pathological lesions represented by micro bleeding and injured astrocytic process (clasmatodendrosis) within 72 h. Histologically, massive deposits of viral nucleoprotein were observed as early as 24 h post infection in the brain endothelial cells of mouse models and the IAE patients.IAV inoculated endothelial cell lines showed deposition of viral proteins and provoked cell death, while IAV scarcely amplified. Inhibition of viral transcription and translation suppressed the endothelial cell death and the lethality of mouse models.These data suggest that the onset of encephalopathy should be induced by cerebral endothelial infection with IAV.Thus, IAV entry into the endothelium, and transcription and/or translation of viral RNA, but not viral proliferation, should be the key pathogenesis of IAE.

A dairy worker's infection is important because it confirms that humans can be infected with H5N1 after contact with cows. CDC CNN — A US farmworker who caught bird flu after working with dairy cattle in Texas appears to be the first known case of mammal-to-human transmission of the virus, a new study shows. The dairy worker sought care in late March after developing painful red, swollen, weeping eyes with burst blood vessels. He had no fever, however, and his lungs were clear, according to a letter about the case that was published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Friday. He reported no contact with sick or dead birds or other animals, but he did have repeated direct close contact with dairy cows in the same part of the state with other infected herds.

Cynthia Goldsmith/CDC Related article H5N1 bird flu was circulating in dairy cows for four months before it was detected, USDA scientists say Even though the man didn’t become seriously ill, his case is important because it confirms that humans can be infected with H5N1 after contact with cows. At the same time, it also leaves critical questions unanswered about a virus that the study authors said has “pandemic potential,” and it illustrates how hard it will be to track the infection in this vulnerable population of workers, where testing positive for an infectious disease might mean losing days of work and pay. “For farmworkers specifically, certainly these are folks that are that are living in a state of economic desperation, and what they’re not going to do is, they’re not going to test for something if they don’t have paid sick leave, because they cannot afford to be sent home and told to stay home and not work,” said Elizabeth Strater, director of strategic campaigns for United Farm Workers. Strater says UFW, like other groups, has heard rumors that there are dairy workers who are sick but don’t want to be tested, but she said it’s nothing that they’re able to confirm. Health officials in Texas said they did test other sick dairy workers, including some with red eyes, but they turned out to have other illnesses, not bird flu. “The people tested volunteered to be tested,” said Lara Anton, senior press officer with the Texas Department of State Health Services. “It’s likely there were other people with symptoms who did not want to be tested so we cannot say with absolute certainty that no one else contracted H5N1. We can say for sure some of the people on dairy farms tested positive for other respiratory viruses that are commonly circulating in the human population,” Anton said. In the case of the man who did test positive for bird flu, he took antiviral medications and recovered without any lasting problems, and his close family members received the drugs as a precaution, the letter says. A farmworker who tested positive for H5N1 bird flu sought care in March for infected, swollen, red eyes. courtesy New England Journal of Medicine Swabs of the patient’s eyes and lungs revealed something interesting, too: His eyes were teeming with the H5N1 virus, but there was hardly any virus in his lungs. That could mean the worker was infected through his eyes – either by rubbing them with contaminated hands or through splashes of contaminated milk – rather than through his lungs, and the virus never migrated there, or that the virus couldn’t get a foothold in his lungs because it was adapted primarily to infect birds, not cells in the human airway. The letter on the case was written by researchers at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention along with doctors at the Texas Department of State Health Services and researchers at the Texas Tech Bioterrorism Response Laboratory. Health officials said they couldn’t do further investigation of how the man was infected because “epidemiological investigations were not able to be conducted at the farm” where he worked. They were also unable to test other workers at the same farm. Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Friday from the CNN Health team. That kind of testing is critical to answer questions about how the worker became infected, whether others were being infected and if so, for how long they were infected and what kind of symptoms they had, if they had any at all. The CDC is looking for farms that will allow it to conduct such a detailed study. “Understanding the current avian flu outbreak among dairy cattle is a vital priority to help protect human health,” the agency said in a statement to CNN. “Discussions are under way with farms in multiple jurisdictions to participate in CDC-led epidemiological studies. In the meantime, states continue to test symptomatic farm workers and monitor those who have been exposed to infected animals. CDC also continues to closely monitor a robust, nationwide flu surveillance system. To date, it has not detected any unusual flu activity.” At a news briefing Friday, White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre said the administration was monitoring the situation “very closely and taking this very seriously.” Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Sign in My Account Settings Topics You Follow Sign Out Your CNN account Sign in to your CNN account Live TV Listen Watch World Africa Americas Asia Australia China Europe India Middle East United Kingdom US Politics SCOTUS Congress Facts First 2024 Elections Business Tech Media Calculators Videos Markets Pre-markets After-Hours Fear & Greed Investing Markets Now Nightcap Health Life, But Better Fitness Food Sleep Mindfulness Relationships Entertainment Movies Television Celebrity Tech Innovate Foreseeable Future Mission: Ahead Work Transformed Innovative Cities Style Arts Design Fashion Architecture Luxury Beauty Video Travel Destinations Food & Drink Stay News Videos Sports Football Tennis Golf Motorsport US Sports Olympics Climbing Esports Hockey Watch Live TV CNN Fast Shows A-Z CNN10 CNN Max CNN TV Schedules Listen CNN 5 Things Chasing Life with Dr. Sanjay Gupta The Assignment with Audie Cornish One Thing Tug of War CNN Political Briefing The Axe Files All There Is with Anderson Cooper All CNN Audio podcasts Science Space Life Unearthed Climate Solutions Weather Features As Equals Call to Earth Freedom Project Impact Your World Inside Africa CNN Heroes Weather Video Climate Ukraine-Russia War Israel-Hamas War About CNN Photos Investigations CNN Profiles CNN Leadership CNN Newsletters Work for CNN Health Watch Listen Live TV Follow CNN Sign in My Account Settings Topics You Follow Sign Out Your CNN account Sign in to your CNN account Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ad Choices Accessibility & CC About Newsletters Transcripts © 2024 Cable News Network.

Irfan Khan/Los Angeles Times via Getty ImagesKeren Landman, MD is a senior reporter covering public health, emerging infectious diseases, the health workforce, and health justice at Vox. Keren is trained as a physician, researcher, and epidemiologist and has served as a disease detective at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Last year, when an H5N1 avian flu virus — commonly known as bird flu — was spilling over from bird populations into a variety of wild mammals, Seema Lakdawala, a virologist and influenza A transmission specialist at Emory University, was “not overly concerned” about human risk. We don’t have “much of an interface with seals or with foxes, for that matter, or polar bears,” she says.But when it comes to cows, that interface is vast. People on dairy farms regularly interact with cows and their milk; when the animals and their milk are infected with a virus that can cause disease in humans, and that mutates constantly, each of those interactions functions as an opportunity for the virus to workshop its adaptability. Now, says Lakdawala, “I am more concerned than I have been, and it’s not for the general public — it is for dairy workers.”The H5N1 outbreak among cows on 34 dairy farms in nine states has so far led to only one very mild human infection. However, the virus was likely spreading among cows for months before it was detected. Lakdawala’s greatest concern is that this highly changeable virus has now arrived at an important point of human-animal convergence, and that we are not prepared. For a virus to cause a human pandemic, it has to have three important characteristics, say flu experts. It has to cause human disease; it has to be something our immune systems haven’t encountered before; and it must spread easily among humans, especially through the air. The latest events do not yet demonstrate that H5N1 has new capacities in any of these categories. However, they hint that the virus has the machinery to evolve those capacities — and that it could do so before we know it.In dairy cows, H5N1 has found an excellent laboratory for evolving traits dangerous to humansAlthough Lakdawala was concerned when mink, seals, and other mammals were infected with H5N1 last year and the year before, cows are different. An outbreak among “mammals with a large interface with humans” is a red flag to her.It’s a numbers game. Although all viruses mutate routinely, flu viruses are particularly good at shapeshifting and can even swap entire chunks of genetic material with other flu viruses if an animal is co-infected with more than one of them. These mutations happen randomly, and most don’t make the viruses more dangerous to humans — but it’s entirely realistic to imagine that some occasionally do. If that occasionally human-threatening mutation happens to a flu virus that has infected, say, a wild fox, it doesn’t pose a particularly high risk of causing a pandemic among humans. After all, few wild foxes have contact with humans. If it happens in a cow, however, there are far more opportunities for the virus to effectively workshop its new features.People who work on dairy farms are constantly interacting with cows and their milk — they check udders, hook and unhook milking machines, and perform other tasks to care for the animals. That puts them in lots of contact with any virus infecting the cows. If the virus were one that didn’t infect and kill people or that doesn’t mutate and adapt as easily as the flu does, perhaps it wouldn’t be as concerning — but H5N1 does infect people at close proximity to animals, and at least half of the more than 900 people who’ve been infected with the virus since it came on the scene in 1996 have died. “There is a high viral load in milk of these infected cows, and so it is a concern to me in terms of spillover [from] cows into workers,” says Lakdawala. “And the more often the virus has an attempt to spill over, the more likely it is to adapt.”We already know the virus is adapting in mammals, she says. “The more spillover events, the more attempts that the virus has to find a successful variant that can take off or infect the human — and then one infected individual, three infected individuals, go home” to their families, where they could potentially spread the virus further.It’s not a pandemic right now, she says, but now is the time to act to reduce the opportunities for spillover events.For the first time, we have proof of H5N1 spreading among a mammalian speciesWhen a virus leaps from one species into another, that’s not usually enough to cause a large outbreak. You could look at H5N1’s history: Although the virus has leapt from animals into people hundreds of times, it has very rarely spread among people. When infections effectively stop spreading once they cross species lines, the non-transmitting species is called a “dead-end host.” Birds readily transmit H5N1 to other birds, but until recently, scientists have thought mammals getting infected with H5N1 were dead-end hosts. In the past couple of years, they’ve had some sneaking suspicion that minks and other mammals getting infected with the virus were spreading it among themselves — but they never had definitive proof. That is, they couldn’t rule out the possibility that all the animals had gotten infected by eating bits of the same sick bird, or through another so-called “common source” exposure.It’s much harder to contain a pathogen’s spread within a species if members of that species can transmit it to each other. What the dairy cow outbreak shows for the first time is that mammals can indeed now infect each other with H5N1 — and can do it efficiently.“Genetic data and epidemiologic data are all quite strongly suggesting that these viruses are getting transmitted in some way between these cows,” says Louise Moncla, a veterinary pathobiologist at the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine whose team has analyzed genetic data from infected cows that the US government recently made available.This virus’s mode of transmission isn’t apparent yet — and it mattersIt’s not yet clear how the virus is being spread through and between dairy cow herds. High viral loads in cows’ udders and in their unpasteurized milk make it possible that contact with contaminated milking machines is doing most of the transmission. However, it’s also possible the virus is spreading through the fecal-oral route or through contaminated air; the latter would be particularly concerning because it’s so much harder to prevent. (Moncla notes that while the classic genetic fingerprint for a bird flu’s ability to spread through air between mammals is absent from this strain of H5N1, that doesn’t mean we’ve ruled out respiratory spread.)Regardless of exactly how H5N1 is spreading among cows, the significance that they’re transmitting the virus to each other is clear to flu experts: If the virus has adapted to spread among one mammalian species, it raises the specter that it can also adapt to spread among humans.There is a precedent for flu viruses to spread from livestock to humans, leading to a pandemic: The 2009 H1N1 flu outbreak began when a flu virus spread from pigs to humans. It caused far less death than expected through a stroke of luck — because the virus had similarities to strains that circulated in the first few decades of the 20th century, many older adults still had some flu immunity left over from childhood infections.If H5N1 develops the ability to spread among humans, it would be a novel infection to most immune systems, giving us much less protection from old flu infections. There are “no signs of that [ability] so far in the cattle sequences,” says Andrew Pekosz, a virologist who studies respiratory virus biology at Johns Hopkins University’s Bloomberg School of Public Health. “That’s a good thing.”Still, because we don’t know much about how influenza A viruses like H5N1 behave in cows, we don’t yet know what cautionary measures will do the most to slow their spread. In 2011, scientists learned that the influenza D virus causes respiratory illness in cattle. However, not all flu viruses are created equal: “I did not ever anticipate seeing an influenza A in cattle,” says Lakdawala.While influenza D infections don’t appear to cause much disease in humans, influenza A viruses very much do: All of the past global flu pandemics have been caused by influenza A viruses. Because this is such an unusual event, says Moncla, “we know very little about how flu replicates and transmits in cows.” That makes it hard to quickly design and implement precautions to prevent the virus from spreading to the people who handle them.“What would calm me down is if we started implementing interventions that would mitigate the presence of the virus and its transmission amongst cattle, and spilling over into humans,” says Lakdawala. “Say, okay: Every dairy farm worker is gonna wear a face shield,” she said. It would help to know whether cows that are infected but asymptomatic have infectious virus in their milk, and whether they can transmit virus to each other, says Pekosz. Ongoing studies by academics and federal agencies should help answer those questions. Here’s why you shouldn’t panicAt the moment, there are more “coulds” than “ares” with H5N1: Although the virus is showing that it could adapt further to spread among humans, so far it hasn’t; and while it’s reasonable to conduct studies to ensure pasteurization works against this particular strain of H5N1, there’s no reason to think it won’t. It’s also worth noting that, according to a US Department of Agriculture representative who recently spoke to the press, the virus has so far not caused severe disease or death in the cows it has infected — they’ve all recovered with supportive care. In that way, this outbreak is very different from the ones we’ve seen in some other mammals.Furthermore, testing at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has already demonstrated that existing antiviral medications are effective at preventing human infections with this strain of H5N1 and that two existing candidate vaccines could be used to rapidly scale up mass production of human vaccines against this virus if needed.So for now, the general public shouldn’t be overly concerned about the virus, says Pekosz. “Scientists are … working extra overtime for this. But the general public should still feel safe.”You’ve read 1 article in the last monthHere at Vox, we're unwavering in our commitment to covering the issues that matter most to you — threats to democracy, immigration, reproductive rights, the environment, and the rising polarization across this country.Our mission is to provide clear, accessible journalism that empowers you to stay informed and engaged in shaping our world.

J. Alexander / iStock Share Copied to clipboard Scientists from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and their collaborators in Texas today shared new details about an investigation into a recently reported H5N1 avian flu infection in a dairy worker—likely the first known transmission of the virus between mammals and a human.The team detailed their clinical and genetic sequencing findings today in a letter to the New England Journal of Medicine. The man's infection, which was mild and consisted of conjunctivitis, was first reported on April 1, and the CDC shared its initial sequencing findings the following day.Follow-up clinical probe stymied by lack of accessThe man's right-eye conjunctivitis began in late March. He didn't have contact with sick or dead birds or other animals but did have direct contact with healthy dairy cows, as well as ones that had illness signs that were similar to those at nearby facilities where H5N1 was confirmed. He said he wore gloves while working, but not respiratory or eye protection. Researchers said the man's eyes could have become infected by touching them with virus-contaminated hands, or from exposure to respiratory droplets or aerosols from sick cows or activities in the dairy setting.Health workers collected nasopharyngeal and conjunctival swabs, which were positive for H5N1 via PCR testing. There was enough RNA in the conjunctival sample for full genome sequencing, and scientists were able to grow the virus from both specimens.The patient also developed redness in his left eye. He and his household contacts received oseltamivir (Tamiflu), and over the following days, the man recovered, and no symptoms were reported in his contacts.We were also unable to collect acute or convalescent sera to assess seroconversion in the dairy farm worker or household contacts.In the supplementary appendix, researchers said they weren't able to do a follow-up investigation on the sick worker or other exposures among workers at the farm. They also noted that they weren't able to collect follow-up specimens from the patient to track viral loads or shedding duration. "We were also unable to collect acute or convalescent sera to assess seroconversion in the dairy farm worker or household contacts," the group wrote.A spokesperson for the Texas Department of State Health Services told CBS News that the Texas dairy worker came to a Texas field office for testing and did not disclose the name of his workplace.Data gaps but strong evidence of cow-to-human spreadInitial sequencing found that the virus belonged to the same B3.13 genotype circulating in dairy cows, and virus isolation from both specimens yielded identical viruses. As reported earlier by the CDC, the virus in the man's specimen had a change, PB2 E67K, that has a known link to virus adaptation to mammalian hosts.In the supplementary appendix, the group said when they compared the sequence from the patient with the available cattle sequences, they found that the human sequence lies just outside the larger cluster of cattle sequences from Texas, though it is closer to cattle than B3.13 genotype viruses from wild birds or wild mammals."Sequence data from the farm where the infected dairy farm worker was exposed to presumably infected was not available," they wrote, noting that the sequencing picture so far has gaps and suggests the virus may have been circulating undetected for some time.They said it's possible that the patient was infected with an earlier slightly different virus or that there was more than one independent spillover of the B3.13 genotype from wild birds to cattle.Taken together, though, they wrote the genetic and epidemiologic evidence provide strong evidence of transmission from a sick cow to a human.

The results confirmed findings of earlier testing of a more limited number of samples and add weight to the FDA’s conclusion that pasteurized milk products are safe for consumption despite a widespread outbreak of cows infected with H5N1.advertisement “These additional, preliminary results further affirm the safety of the U.S. commercial milk supply,” Donald Prater, acting director of the FDA’s Center of Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, told reporters. Last week, the FDA announced it had conducted PCR testing in 96 commercially purchased milk products and found genetic traces of the H5N1 virus in 1 in 5 samples, but that early data showed no live virus. On Wednesday, the agency reported results from testing of a further 201 products, which included cottage cheese and sour cream, in addition to milk. Any PCR-positive samples were then injected into embryonated chicken eggs, to see whether any active virus could be grown — the gold standard test for assessing the viability of an influenza virus. None of the samples produced viable, replicating virus, Prater said.

Privacy Policy The 297 samples that the FDA has tested so far represent dairy products from 38 states. In addition, several samples of retail powdered infant formula as well as other powdered milk products were tested. All PCR results from these products were negative. The agency did not disclose when it plans to make its full analysis, including which products were purchased from which states, available to the public.advertisement Bolstering the FDA’s data, academic researchers at the Ohio State University and St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital told STAT Tuesday night that their own study of 58 PCR-positive milk samples taken from Texas, Kansas, and eight other states in the Midwest also failed to turn up any evidence that H5N1 can survive the pasteurization process. “It was pretty much what we were expecting,” said Richard Webby, an influenza virologist at St. Jude whose laboratory conducted the viral growth experiments — in mammalian cell lines as well as embryonated chicken eggs. The samples they tested had varying levels of viral RNA, from very low to pretty large amounts, Webby said. Although it was nothing like what’s been seen coming off the udders of infected cows. “Certainly, the viral load is getting diluted,” he said. But there was still enough RNA in the samples they were testing that if those levels had represented real, viable virus, he would have expected to be find it. “If these samples had full virus particles capable of replication, we would have expected to see growth in cells and eggs, which we did not see. The conclusion is we simply don’t think there’s any replicating virus in these samples. What we’re finding are probably just remnants of the virus.” Related: There’s never a good time to drink raw milk. But now’s a really bad time as bird flu infects cows Webby and other scientists are more worried about possible health risks from drinking raw milk. Although little is currently known about the potential for humans contracting H5N1 from consuming raw milk from infected cows, researchers are raising the alarm that the consequences could be dire. In the wild, mammals like foxes, bears, and seals that have been sickened with H5N1 — presumably from eating infected birds or drinking water contaminated with their feces — have suffered severe symptoms, including brain damage and death. “In humans we don’t know how much milk you’d have to drink to get infected, or if 10 people drank raw milk from an infected cow how many would come down with it,” Webby said. “But it’s not an experiment I’d want to participate in.” The FDA is urging consumers not to drink raw milk or eat raw milk cheeses. That is a position the agency has long held, because of the other health risks these products hold, but it has re-emphasized it in the context of the current outbreak. “We continue to strongly advise against the consumption of raw milk,” Prater said at the news conference Wednesday. Related: What we’re starting to learn about H5N1 in cows, and the risk to people He did not say whether the FDA has conducted any testing of raw milk products currently on the market. But it is testing samples of pooled raw milk — milk that is trucked in from multiple farms to centralized processing facilities where pasteurization takes place. This will be used to better understand how much virus from asymptomatic or presymptomatic animals is making it into the milk supply, and inform further studies to validate the effectiveness of different methods of pasteurization, Prater said. FDA has also recommended the dairy industry not “manufacture or sell raw milk or raw milk products, including raw milk cheese, made with milk from cows showing symptoms of illness, including those infected with avian influenza viruses or exposed to those infected with avian influenza viruses.” It has also urged producers to discard milk from affected cows and pasteurize raw milk from exposed cattle before feeding it to other animals. Cats that have been fed raw milk from cows infected with H5N1 have been sickened and some have died, according to a study published Monday. So far, only one person — a farm worker in Texas who developed conjunctivitis — has been confirmed to be infected by dairy cows. H5N1 bird flu has been circulating in dairy cow herds in parts of the country for months now. So far, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has reported 36 herds in nine states have tested positive for the virus, but the genetic evidence of H5N1 in milk suggests the outbreak is more widespread.

Back to Healio Key takeaways:Pasteurized milk and beef appear safe from infectious bird flu virus.Scientists described what is potentially the first mammal-to-human case of H5N1.The FDA and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) said this week that pasteurized milk and beef products appear safe for consumption based on testing conducted after traces of avian influenza were found in pasteurized milk.Cow herds in nine states have tested positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus, also referred to as “bird flu,” according to the latest update from U.S. health officials. The outbreak has grown to include 36 herds of cattle. U.S. health officials expressed confidence that the nation’s pasteurized milk and beef supplies remain safe from infectious H5N1 virus. Image: Adobe Stock. Below are some recent developments in the ongoing H5N1 outbreak.First mammal-to-human transmission?A dairy farm worker in Texas has also been infected — only the second time a person in the United States has tested positive for H5N1 avian influenza.According to new details published Friday by Timothy M. Uyeki, MD, chief medical officer in the CDC’s Influenza Division, and other scientists in The New England Journal of Medicine, the worker had contact with cows showing signs of illness consistent with H5N1 infection, and testing showed a close genetic similarity between the worker’s infection and viruses detected in dairy cattle in Texas.Uyeki and colleagues said virus samples collected from the worker and from cattle “maintained primarily avian genetic characteristics” and lacked genetic changes that would affect the risk for transmission to humans.The virus exhibited no evidence of reduced susceptibility to influenza antivirals, and its hemagglutinin — the surface protein that binds influenza viruses to human cells — was a good fit with viruses found in H5N1 candidate vaccines, Uyeki and colleagues reported.The worker’s only symptom was conjunctivitis. Uyeki and colleagues provided some hypotheses about the case in an appendix published with their report, including that the worker’s conjunctivae could have been infected through direct contact with contaminated hands or through respiratory droplets or aerosols that contained virus from sick cows, or even through contact with a contaminated surface.“If cow-to-human transmission occurred,” they wrote, “to our knowledge, this would be the first reported case of mammal-to-human HPAI A(H5N1) virus transmission reported worldwide.”Milk is safe, FDA saysThe FDA announced last week that testing identified genetic traces of H5N1 in pasteurized cow milk samples collected from grocery stores in the U.S.The particles were identified through quantitative PCR (qPCR) testing, which can detect the presence of genetic material but cannot determine if a pathogen remains intact or infectious. For that, the FDA conducted further testing of 201 qPCR-positive retail dairy samples from liquid milk, cottage cheese and sour cream, which detected no live or infectious virus, showing that pasteurization is effective at inactivating HPAI, the FDA said this week. The agency also tested samples of retail powdered formula and powdered milk products for viral fragments and found none.“In addition to preliminary results released late last week on an initial set of 96 retail milk samples, these results reaffirm our assessment that the commercial milk supply is safe,” the FDA said.The agency said it will continue to test samples of pooled raw milk that has been routed to pasteurization and processing for commercial use to be used as a basis to characterize potential virus levels that pasteurization may encounter and to inform future studies validating pasteurization.Because of the potential risks associated with consuming raw milk, the FDA continues to strongly advise against drinking or selling it.Fatal cat infectionsAlthough there have not been any reported human infections from consuming raw milk, a recent CDC report assessing dairy cattle and cats at farms in both Kansas and Texas showed “fatal systemic influenza infection” in domestic cats on the farms who were given unpasteurized colostrum and milk from affected cows.At one north Texas dairy farm, more than half the cats became ill and died. The symptoms included neurological signs of illness and blindness."The cats were found dead with no apparent signs of injury and were from a resident population of 24 domestic cats that had been fed milk from sick cows," the authors wrote. Tests of samples collected from the brains and lungs of the dead cats suggested "high amounts of virus."“The recurring nature of global HPAI H5N1 virus outbreaks and detection of spillover events in a broad host range is concerning and suggests increasing virus adaptation in mammals,” they concluded. “Surveillance of HPAI viruses in domestic production animals, including cattle, is needed to elucidate influenza virus evolution and ecology and prevent cross-species transmission.”USDA ‘confident’ meat supply is safeThe USDA announced the results of several studies testing the safety of the nation’s beef supply.The first study involved 30 samples of ground beef collected from retail stores in states where dairy cow herds have tested positive for H5N1. The samples were analyzed using PCR testing, which showed no virus particles were present in the beef.The remaining studies involve testing muscle samples from culled dairy cows and cooking ground beef contaminated with an H5N1 surrogate virus at different temperatures to determine its effect on the virus. Results of those studies are forthcoming.“USDA is confident that the meat supply is safe,” a USDA spokesperson told Healio, describing a “rigorous meat inspection process” in which veterinarians from the USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) “are present at all federal livestock slaughter facilities.”“FSIS inspects each animal before slaughter, and all cattle carcasses must pass inspection after slaughter and be determined to be fit to enter the human food supply,” the spokesperson said. “While we have multiple safeguards in place to protect consumers, we recommend consumers properly handle raw meats and cook to a safe internal temperature.” References: Burrough ER, et al.

COMMENTARY: Should We Be Concerned About Bovine H5N1 Influenza Virus? By Dr. Nitish Boodhoo, research associate, Department of Pathobiology, University of Guelph This article is republished from The Conversation Canada under a Creative Commons licence. Read the original article The confirmed presence of bird flu in American dairy cattle in a March 25 report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) — and a case in Texas where a human working with cattle was infected — has put Canadian public health experts on high alert. But, what is bird flu and what do we know about influenza in both poultry and cattle? Bird flu, also called avian flu, refers to infection caused by the avian influenza Type A viruses. In the wild, influenza viruses generally spread among migratory waterfowls, such as ducks and geese. Within avian species, domestic poultry are highly susceptible to infection with Type A avian influenza viruses, including H5N1. Canada itself is amid an H5N1 avian influenza virus outbreak, with over 11 million domestic poultry estimated to be affected and culled to date. In fact, a major concern for the Canadian poultry supply chain is the incurred financial loss from culling birds. This virus is highly contagious among domestic poultry and can spread through an entire flock within a matter of days. The most common route of transmission from an infected bird to a non-vaccinated bird is via direct physical contact or contact with virus-contaminated surfaces with bodily fluids such as oral mucus and feces. Bird flu in mammals The proposed transmission cycle of the H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus. (Nitish Boodhoo) Non-avian species, like mammals, can also become infected with the H5N1 virus. In Canada, sporadic cases of mammals becoming infected with bird flu have been reported in raccoons, striped skunks, red foxes, cats and dogs. As of March 2024, various reports from the USDA, Food and Drug Administration, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed the presence of H5N1 in dairy cattle across eight states, of which Idaho, Ohio and Michigan are the most northern states bordering Canada. Although there are no known reports indicating the current bovine strain has made its way into Canada, there is no doubt that it is getting too close for comfort. As of March 27, 2024, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency has established various primary control zones in Alberta to prevent the spread of H5N1. The emerging bovine H5N1 virus is novel to the cattle industry, a backbone of the Canadian food and agriculture industry. The close environmental relationship between humans and cattle would seem to make both species more vulnerable to influenza transmission, but that is not the case. Interestingly, only a few cases of cattle-to-human influenza transmission have been documented. In contrast, pigs are the main mixing vessel for avian influenza A viruses, as exemplified in the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic. The 2009 swine H1N1 virus was a mixing event that led to mammalian adaptation, a process that is not straightforward in any intermediate host. A natural mixing event in pigs would result from exchange of genetic material following co-infection with both an avian and human influenza virus. However, in the current scenario, the emerging bovine H5N1 strain that has infected American dairy cattle has undergone a specific adaptation in an enzyme called polymerase. Changes to this viral enzyme are concerning, as it could allow for faster adaptation and maybe even support cattle-to-cattle transmission. This raises numerous questions for which the answers are not yet clear. Among these, the key questions are: How are dairy cattle getting infected? Is viral transmission from infected to non-infected cattle, or strictly direct contact with contaminated surfaces or infected birds? Are cattle relevant as an intermediary in the transmission chain of Type A influenza viruses such as H5N1 from poultry to cattle, eventually infecting humans? The answers will support new regulations to control H5N1 spread within dairy cattle and to other farms, poultry, mammals and humans. The greater concern would be if this virus has entered the pig industry. Are there vaccines against H5N1 for humans and livestock? According to a CDC report, the H5N1 viral strain that infected a human in Texas is closely related to two candidate vaccines. It is also reassuring to know that the World Health Organization maintains a list of candidate vaccines that could be mass-produced against H5N1 influenza viruses. In fact, some countries maintain a small stockpile of vaccine doses against H5N1, should there be a need to vaccinate at-risk populations. Until such an outbreak event occurs where vaccines against H5N1 for people might be required, the Canadian government has a list of preventive measures that people can take. Members of the public need to keep their distance and avoid direct contact with wild birds that look sick or have died. People should also avoid touching surfaces where there are likely to be bird droppings. As for livestock species, both the American and Canadian governments have been reluctant to approve the use of vaccines in the poultry industry. The long-standing strategy against avian influenza has been eradication, and not vaccination, by culling all infected and affected chickens. While it has been successful at preventing the virus from becoming endemic, it may not be economically sustainable with H5N1 outbreaks predicted to occur on a yearly basis. In the wake of this unprecedented news, efforts have to be directed to study avian influenza transmission from poultry into cattle. Such proactive efforts will hopefully generate necessary data to establish a decision-making framework to safeguard our livestock industry and protect human health.

A U.S. Department of Agriculture laboratory confirmed Thursday the detection of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza H5N1 from dairy cows in a northeastern Colorado herd. It is the first detection of the disease in Colorado. The Colorado State Veterinarian's office was notified Monday about a herd demonstrating clinical symptoms of HPAI in cattle, a Colorado Department of Agriculture press release stated. RELATED Pasteurization working to kill bird flu in milk, early FDA results findBird flu was first detected in a Texas dairy herd on March 25. "We continue to see this ongoing HPAI outbreak evolve and over the last month have seen transmission of the virus now move into dairy cattle. While we don't yet completely understand the mechanism of transmission of this virus, we do know that it appears to be spreading from cow to cow and between herds," stated Colorado State Veterinarian Dr. Maggie Baldwin. "It is critically important that producers implement enhanced biosecurity measures to mitigate the spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza." Getty Images Infected cattle typically exhibit a decrease in appetite and milk production. The milk also appears abnormally "colostrum-like," per the USDA. However, cattle usually recover with sufficient care. The USDA and U.S. Food and Drug Administration have both declared commercially produced milk to be safe for consumers.

NIAID As agricultural authorities and epidemiologists try to get their arms around the scope of the latest confounding chapter in the decades-long story of the H5N1 avian influenza virus — its jump into U.S. herds of dairy cattle — they’re turning to the genetic breadcrumbs the virus leaves behind in the animals’ nose, lungs, and, primarily, milk. On Wednesday, U.S. Department of Agriculture scientists released a preprint — a study that has not yet been peer-reviewed — describing for the first time what their investigations of 220 viral genomes from infected cows have so far turned up. The study’s authors suggest that the spread in cattle started from a single spillover event from birds in the Texas panhandle that may have happened in early December. The USDA didn’t confirm the presence of H5N1 in a Texas herd until March 25.advertisement “These data support a single introduction event from wild bird origin virus into cattle, likely followed by limited local circulation for approximately 4 months prior to confirmation by USDA,” the authors wrote. The findings add more precision to what had previously been reported by academic scientists. Reading viral genomes can provide clues to the origins of the outbreak and allows researchers to monitor how the virus, which primarily infects wild and farmed birds, is changing as it finds a foothold in bovine hosts.

Privacy Policy In an initial analysis of USDA genome sequence data released last week, academic DNA sleuths had revealed that the outbreak in dairy cows has likely been going on for months longer than previously realized, and has probably spread more widely than official numbers would suggest. So far, the USDA has reported 36 herds in nine states have tested positive for the virus.advertisement The new analysis also offers a window into how the bird flu is changing as it spends time in the bodies of cattle. In the last few years, H5N1 has spread from wild birds to a variety of carnivorous mammals, including foxes, bears, and seals, but in each of those instances, the virus has hit a dead end. The outbreak in dairy cows represents one of the first times that this bird flu virus has demonstrated the ability to efficiently transmit between mammals, said Thomas Mettenleiter, a virologist who served as the director of the Friedrich Loeffler Institut — Germany’s leading animal disease research center — from 1996 until he stepped down last year. The other instance was a number of outbreaks at mink farms in Spain and Finland in 2022 and 2023, respectively. “These spillover events don’t usually lead to transmission chains,” he said. “This situation is definitely an eye-opener for me.” Related: Tracking bird flu virus changes in cows is stymied by missing data, scientists say The USDA’s analysis found about two dozen mutations that have arisen in the H5N1 virus as it has circulated in dairy cattle that are known to make influenza viruses more deadly or more likely to be able to infect humans. “It’s still really difficult to draw a risk map out of that, but there seems to be ongoing evolution,” Mettenleiter said. “This is not surprising but it’s good to know. All these mammal-to-mammal passages, as we would do experimentally, put an evolutionary pressure on the virus to mutate and this is what we see with the increase of these known mammalian adaptation markers.” Vivien Dugan, director of the influenza division at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told STAT Thursday that the mutations found so far did not raise any immediate red flags for increased risk to human health. “I think based on our analysis of the consensus and some of that raw [sequence] data — because we have a good data-sharing relationship with USDA — we’ve not seen anything that would be concerning to us for mammalian adaptation, at this point,” Dugan said. The CDC has been testing existing H5 vaccines in ferrets, and found that vaccination appears to offer cross-protection against the virus from the man who was infected in Texas. Related: Republicans, concerned about dairy industry, urge calm about H5N1 bird flu Scientists who have been frustrated by the slow drip of data from the USDA’s investigations hailed the preprint on social media as progress. “Really grateful to this research team for sharing this, though I hope they weren’t holding on to the data solely to ensure they published first,” Angela Rasmussen, a virologist who studies pathogens that jump from animals to people at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization at the University of Saskatchewan, in Saskatoon, Canada, posted on X on Thursday. For weeks, the agency has been facing criticism from scientists and pandemic experts for a lack of transparency and timely sharing of data about the outbreak that has slowed down efforts to track its progress. When the USDA finally uploaded a large tranche of genetic sequences of the pathogen to a public database, researchers eager to analyze the sequences to determine if the H5N1 virus has been changing as it is transmitted from cow to cow quickly discovered that the sequences didn’t include necessary information about when and where the samples were collected. All are simply labeled with “USA” and “2024.” The USDA has denied taking that basic information — called metadata — off the sequence files. The agency’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has said it is sharing raw sequence data as quickly as it is available and plans to upload “consensus sequences,” which are more thoroughly edited and contain the metadata scientists are seeking, when they are ready.

Opens in a new tab or window email article Credit: NIAID With avian influenza A (H5N1) infecting more mammals than ever before -- including U.S. dairy cattle -- infectious disease experts are paying close attention to whether current influenza antivirals would be effective should H5N1 adapt to humans. All influenza viruses have extremely similar internal mechanisms for reproduction, William Schaffner, MD, of Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee, and a spokesperson for the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), told MedPage Today. So if an antiviral works against one strain, it will also work on other strains, he said. "Everything I've heard from the CDC and elsewhere ... is that the antivirals that we have available today will work against H5N1. And that's consistent with the effect of the antivirals against past avian influenza strains," Schaffner said. This includes neuraminidase inhibitors, such as oseltamivir (Tamiflu), zanamivir (Relenza), and peramivir (Rapivab), as well as the polymerase inhibitor baloxavir (Xofluza). While neuraminidase inhibitors interfere with the enzyme that allows a virus to cleave itself off an infected cell in order to spread, polymerase inhibitors interfere with replication at the level of messenger RNA. The CDC is working in the lab "to better characterize the virus from the human case in Texas," and the agency "completed susceptibility testing for the most common class of influenza antiviral medications that are used for seasonal influenza," a spokesperson for the CDC's Center for Global Health told MedPage Today. The testing confirmed that "the H5N1 virus was susceptible to all commercially available FDA-approved and recommended neuraminidase inhibitors," the spokesperson said. Testing to confirm the susceptibility of a different type of antiviral medication is ongoing since it takes longer, he added. Interim CDC guidance suggests initiating antiviral treatment with a neuraminidase inhibitor as early as possible for symptomatic outpatients, and using oseltamivir to treat severe, progressive, or complicated H5N1. For people who meet the epidemiologic exposure criteria, oseltamivir also is recommended as prophylaxis. Still, Schaffner noted that "antivirals are by no means a panacea." Andrew Pavia, MD, professor and chief of the division of pediatric infectious diseases at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, said that while evidence indicates oseltamivir would be effective, "effective doesn't mean it's an ideal drug." For instance, oseltamivir, like other antivirals, is most effective if taken in the first 48 hours, which can be a difficult window to catch. There are many other unknowns about treating H5N1 with antivirals, such as whether antivirals would have clinical benefit or if resistance would develop. "We don't know the answer because we have not seen a lot of human infections with this particular strain of H5N1," Pavia said. Some experts have questioned whether the U.S. has been adequately testing for H5N1. The U.S. has a large stockpile of oseltamivir but has less of newer drugs like baloxavir, which has a different mechanism and could be vital if oseltamivir resistance became a problem, Pavia said. In terms of using a combination of drugs, he said there have not been studies showing clear benefits, though that's something the research community is pursuing. In terms of other potential treatments, a trio of vaccines has already been developed and approved, and last year Via Nova Therapeutics received an FDA Investigational New Drug application for a nucleoprotein inhibitor, VNT-101. "H5N1 has been behaving in ways that we didn't expect which means that we know we have to watch it very carefully," Pavia said. "That doesn't mean we know what it's going to do, but it means we have to have a lot of humility and invest some real resources in studying it and watching it."

Guido Mieth/Getty ImagesAvian influenza (bird flu) has been detected in cattle and chickens in the U.S.However, experts say the risk that humans will contract the virus from animals is low.People are also unlikely to contract the virus from eating meat, dairy, or eggs.Samples of ground beef sold at grocery stores were collected and tested for bird flu by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. All samples tested negative for the virus. On April 26, 2024, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that there is an ongoing outbreak of bird flu, also known as “avian influenza.”The A(H5N1) virus that causes bird flu has been detected in 34 herds of cattle across nine states, including Idaho, New Mexico, Texas, South Dakota, Kansas, Michigan, Ohio, North Carolina, and, most recently, Colorado. However, according to reports published in the journal Nature, preliminary analysis of genomic data suggests that a strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza may have been silently spreading in U.S. cattle for months earlier than previously believed, with the virus likely jumping from an infected bird into a cow around late December 2023 or early January this year. On Monday, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced it had collected 30 samples of ground beef sold at grocery stores for testing in states where outbreaks of bird flu in dairy cows had occurred. On Wednesday, they announced all the samples tested were negative for the H5N1 bird flu virus.They remain confident that the meat supply is safe and does not pose a risk to humans.The FDA has also tested samples of additional products to ensure safety. These included sour cream, cottage cheese, retail powdered infant formula, and powdered milk products marketed as toddler formula. On Tuesday, they announced that all samples had also tested negative for the virus.How likely is it that bird flu will spread to humans?Dr. Daisy May — a veterinary surgeon and pet care writer for All About Parrots — said that while it’s natural to be concerned about the possibility of bird flu spreading to humans, the bottom line is that the virus is highly contagious among birds but not in people.“[T]he likelihood of sustained human-to-human transmission remains extremely low with proper precautions,” she said.In fact, the CDC has stated that only one human case has been confirmed after exposure to dairy cows that were likely infected with the virus. This was reported to the agency by the state of Texas on April 1 of this year.Previously, on April 28, 2022, the CDC announced that a person in Colorado had contracted bird flu after being directly exposed to infected poultry.In both cases of human infection, however, the CDC said symptoms were mild, and the patients recovered quickly.May explained that in the cases where we’ve seen people contract bird flu, it’s been from direct exposure to infected birds, their droppings, or contaminated coop areas — not person to person.The CDC advises that people can protect themselves from bird flu by avoiding exposure to sick or dead animals — both wild and domestic — including their carcasses, raw milk, feces, litter, or any other materials that have been contaminated by them.Can humans get bird flu from beef, chicken, milk, or eggs?You’re not likely to contract bird flu from eating beef or chicken, according to Dan Gallagher, a Registered Dietitian with Aegle Nutrition.“The chances of getting sick from eating chicken or beef, even with the bird flu outbreak, are still incredibly low,” he noted.The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has a Food Safety and Inspection Service inspection program to ensure that sick animals do not enter the food supply.Gallagher said, “If you’re worried about potential infection, make sure you’re cooking your meat thoroughly and you’ll have no problems.”Additionally, May said that when it comes to eggs, you should be fine if you cook them completely and do not leave them runny.“The virus is highly vulnerable to heat, and standard cooking temperatures are more than sufficient to kill it off entirely,” she said.As far as milk and dairy products, pasteurization will kill any bird flu virus that might be present.While it has been reported by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that commercially available milk tested positive for bird flu in 1 out of 5 samples tested, experts say this is not necessarily cause for concern.The method used to test the milk — quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) — detects the virus’s genetic material. This means it cannot be used to determine whether any live virus is present in the sample.In fact, when the scientists did further testing, they found that there was no live virus present, confirming that pasteurization did indeed do its job.However, May says you should be cautious when it comes to raw milk from small farms or private sellers since it has not been treated in this way.How to safely prepare beef, poultry, and eggsTo safely prepare meats, poultry, and eggs, the USDA advises the following:Wash your hands with warm water and soap for 20 seconds both before and after handling raw poultry and eggs.Keep raw poultry and eggs away from other food.After cutting meat, wash your cutting board, knife, and countertop with hot, soapy water.Use 1 tablespoon bleach diluted in 1 gallon of water to sanitize your cutting board.Use a food thermometer during cooking to ensure an internal temperature of 165 °F (73.9 °C) for poultry and 145 °F (62.8 °C) for beef.TakeawayThere is an ongoing bird flu outbreak in the United States. The virus has been detected in both cows and chickens.Experts say, however, that the risk to humans is low, especially if they use proper precautions when working directly with animals. Also, while it is highly contagious in animal populations, it does not pass from person to person.Pasteurized milk is safe to consume, but you should be wary of raw milk.The risk of contracting bird flu from eating beef, poultry, and eggs is also very low due to the USDA’s inspection process. Proper cooking and handling of beef, poultry, and eggs will also help ensure that these foods are safe to eat.How we reviewed this article:HistoryShare this articleWritten by Nancy Schimelpfening, MS — Fact checked by Jill Seladi-Schulman, Ph.D. — Updated on May 2, 2024Read this nextFDA Finds Traces of Bird Flu Virus in Grocery Store Milk But Says It's Still SafeThe FDA has announced that traces of the bird flu virus have been detected in dairy milk.

Opens in a new tab or window Share on X. Opens in a new tab or window Share on LinkedIn. Opens in a new tab or window email article Strong genetic evidence makes it highly likely that a dairy farm worker in Texas contracted avian influenza A (H5N1) from cattle, according to a detailed case report from the CDC and Texas Department of State Health Services. Genome sequencing from a conjunctival swab taken from the worker revealed that all gene segments of the virus were closely related to the H5N1 viruses detected in dairy cattle and wild birds in Texas in March, reported Timothy Uyeki, MD, MPH, of the CDC, and colleagues in a brief correspondence in the New England Journal of Medicine. "Our findings are suggestive of human infection occurring in the dairy farm setting and cow-to-human transmission of HPAI [highly pathogenic avian influenza] A (H5N1) virus from presumptively infected cows to an exposed dairy farm worker," the authors wrote in an accompanying supplementary report. The case of H5N1 in the dairy farm worker, whose only symptom was conjunctivitis, was first announced on April 1. "If cow-to-human transmission occurred, to our knowledge, this would be the first reported case of mammal-to-human HPAI A (H5N1) virus transmission reported worldwide," Uyeki and colleagues noted. "However, we cannot exclude fomite transmission because no specimens from cows or environmental samples were available from the worker's farm for testing," they cautioned. In addition to the lack of specimens from cows and the worker's farm environment, the researchers were not able to perform assessments of other potential worker exposures at the dairy farm, nor were they able to collect serum samples to assess for seroconversion in the worker or household contacts. Additional conjunctival and nasopharyngeal swab specimens from the worker to assess viral levels or duration of viral shedding were also not available, the authors pointed out. Since 2020, H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b subtype viruses have spread widely among wild birds worldwide, resulting in outbreaks in poultry and other animals. Recently, the clade 2.3.4.4b viruses were identified in dairy cows and in unpasteurized milk in multiple U.S. states, as well as in cats. The adult farm worker initially presented only with mild symptoms of conjunctivitis in the right eye. The worker had no changes in vision or systemic signs or symptoms, and also reported no contact with any animals, including birds, except dairy cows. Some of those cows were showing signs of illness similar to other cows in the same region of Texas infected with H5N1. Of note, conjunctivitis in humans from H5N1 infection has rarely been documented. The worker reported wearing gloves but no other protective equipment when working with the cows. The worker could have contracted conjunctivitis through direct contact with hands contaminated with cow respiratory secretions, milk, or fomites or via respiratory droplets or aerosols from sick cows or the environment, the authors speculated. Conjunctival and nasopharyngeal swabs were taken from the worker's right eye, and initial testing of the samples were performed at a CDC laboratory within the Texas Tech Bioterrorism Response Laboratory. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing suggested infection with influenza A and A(H5). Samples were then sent to the CDC for confirmatory testing. The worker was told to isolate at home and was treated with oral oseltamivir (Tamiflu) 75 mg twice a day for 5 days. Members of the worker's household were also treated with oseltamivir for postexposure prophylaxis. The worker's symptoms resolved rapidly over a period of several days. While acute conjunctivitis is a clinically mild illness, H5N1 viruses, including those belonging to clade 2.3.4.4b, pose pandemic potential and have caused severe respiratory disease in humans. The H5N1 virus isolated from the worker's specimen had a change in the genome associated with adaption that is known to occur in mammals infected with avian influenza A viruses, including H5N1. However, the viral sequences from the worker and from cattle in Texas "maintained primarily avian genetic characteristics," the authors wrote. No changes were observed in the hemagglutinin gene that would increase receptor-binding specificity in the human upper respiratory tract and increase risk of transmission to humans, Uyeki and colleagues noted. There were much higher levels of viral RNA detected in the worker's conjunctival swab than the nasal swab, they wrote, which "could reflect differences in viral replication in the conjunctivae and nasopharynx." Additionally, the researchers found no genetic evidence of reduced susceptibility to currently available influenza antiviral drugs.

The only indication that he had been infected was a striking case of pinkeye.Details of the man’s case — the only documented instance of bird flu spreading from a cow to a human — were published Friday in the New England Journal of Medicine, from health officials in Texas and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A dairy worker in Texas developed pinkeye when he got bird flu. New England Journal of MedicineBird flu was first detected in several herds of dairy cows in late March. Around that same time, the man's right eye started to bother him and became red. He ended up with broken blood vessels in both eyes. Doctors said he had conjunctivitis, or pinkeye. The man had been in direct contact with both healthy and sick cows.Swabs of the man’s eye and nose revealed he had the same strain of bird flu, H5N1, that was circulating in dairy cows.The man was given the antiviral Tamiflu and was told to isolate as he recovered. No one he lives with became sick, though they, too, were given the antiviral to reduce that risk, the authors wrote. He never developed respiratory symptoms, which suggests that the virus may not spread easily from person to person through coughs or sneezes.Indeed, genetic tests done on samples taken from the man’s eyes and nose confirmed that there were no mutations that would allow the virus to spread this way.But the threat that mutations like that could arise is real, especially as the virus continues to spread among dairy cows. As of Friday, 36 herds in nine states — Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Michigan, New Mexico, North Carolina, South Dakota, Ohio and Texas — had been affected by the outbreak.Holstein dairy cows.Charlie Litchfield / AP fileH5N1 viruses “pose pandemic potential and have caused severe respiratory disease in infected humans worldwide,” the report’s authors wrote. “Therefore, rapid implementation of preventive measures is recommended to reduce human exposures to any infected animals and environments contaminated by them.”Data from other countries show the virus can have a fatality rate of more than 50% in humans, according to the CDC. More than 100 people have been told to monitor themselves for symptoms, and about 25 people have been tested for bird flu, the CDC said during a media briefing on Wednesday. So far no one else has tested positive. But veterinary experts suspect that cases are going undetected among dairy farmers worried that they’ll lose their cattle if they report a positive test.“Farmers are very, very concerned about what happens if they’re positive,” said Dr. Keith Poulsen, director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory. “When I talk to dairy farmers in Wisconsin, a lot of them just want it to go away like, ‘well, what do we do about it? I’m really only concerned about whether or not I can make my mortgage next week.’”No bird flu has been found in cows in Wisconsin, but Poulsen said the outbreak has the potential to lower consumer confidence about the safety of dairy products.“If the dairy industry takes a hit anywhere in the country, then it takes a hit on us, too,” he said. The Department of Agriculture said earlier this week that tests on hundreds of pasteurized products like milk, cottage cheese and sour cream, showed no signs of live virus and are safe to consume.While the authors of the new report could not rule out the possibility that the Texas dairy worker was infected through respiratory droplets, they wrote that the man likely got infected by rubbing his eyes with a contaminated hand. He was wearing gloves but no goggles or other form of eye protection.The CDC recommends that anyone in contact with dairy cattle wear protective equipment, including safety glasses, waterproof aprons and boots that can be sanitized.The authors of the report said they were not able to follow up with the worker to do additional testing to study his antibodies or see how long the virus stayed in his system.Erika EdwardsErika Edwards is a health and medical news writer and reporter for NBC News and "TODAY."AboutContactHelpCareersAd ChoicesPrivacy PolicyYour Privacy ChoicesCA NoticeTerms of Service (Updated JULY 7, 2023)NBC News SitemapClosed CaptioningAdvertiseSelect ShoppingSelect Personal Finance© 2024 NBCUniversal Media, LLCNBC News LogoMSNBC LogoToday LogoOfficials (nearly) ready to close the book on the flu season Open in Our App Get the best experience and stay connected to your community with our Spectrum News app. Learn More Open in Spectrum News App Continue in Browser Toggle navigation Maine EDIT WATCH LIVE | Recent Activity Log Out Recent Activity Log In Latest News Weather Today's Forecast 7 Day Forecast Interactive Radar Storm Season Watches and Warnings Weather Blog Politics Local and National Politics Your Voter Guide Washington D.C.

WEATHER ALERTView full list of active weather alerts CLOSINGS ALERTView full list of closings (Associated Press/Mark J. Terrill, File) Officials (nearly) ready to close the book on a âmoderateâ flu season in Maine By Sean Murphy Maine PUBLISHED 4:39 PM ET May 03, 2024 PUBLISHED May 3, 2024 @4:39 PM SHARE There are still about two weeks left in the 2023-2024 influenza season here in Maine, but so far experts are calling it a âmoderateâ season, with no sign of the jaw-dropping spike that marked the beginning of the 2022-2023 season. The official dates of the annual flu season in Maine are Oct. 1 through May 18. The latest data from the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention includes the week ending April 27, 2024. According to the data, there have been 52 influenza-related deaths this season. To date, medical providers reported 649 hospitalizations related to the flu. There have also been 715 positive test results. Anna Kruger, epidemiologist with Maine CDC, said influenza emerged in December 2023, and has dropped below seasonal activity levels starting in mid-March 2024. âInfluenza really has slowed down in recent weeks,â she said. Dr. Dora Mills, chief health improvement officer at MaineHealth, said she has been following influenza cases in Maine for about 30 years, and data from this past season has been about average. âFor influenza, I would say itâs been a moderate season,â she said. Mills also noted that the continued presence of COVID-19 meant that respiratory disease cases were up overall, putting a strain on health care providers in Maine, despite a moderate flu season. âIt was worse this year because we had COVID added to it,â she said. The 2022-2023 influenza season began with an abnormally large surge in cases in December, with as many as 175 hospitalizations at one time, but in the current flu season, Kruger said, there were only two ânot quite as strong peaksâ in mid-December 2023 and late February 2024. Scientists are still debating what led to the 2022 spike in influenza cases. One popular theory is that the coronavirus pandemic drove influenza into dormancy, and when COVID-19 cases began to subside through 2022, it paved the way for influenza to bounce back in December that year. Mills and Kruger both acknowledged that it was possible that the 2022 spike in flu cases was a one-time situation brought on by COVID, but both cautioned that no one knows for sure. As such, one cannot say with certainty that such a surge wonât ever happen again. âEach influenza season is unique,â Kruger said. âItâs really, really hard, if not kind of impossible to predict what any given season is going to look like.â For now, Mills said, the same advice applies: Always make sure your vaccinations are up to date for influenza, COVID and, if you need it, respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV. Mills added that masking, while not necessary all the time, is still a good idea for those with symptoms or vulnerable immune systems. âI think that masking is a precaution, but simply an added step of protection that people can use and not look way out of place,â she said. Kruger also noted that despite the end of the official flu season, people can still catch the influenza virus. âItâs important for us to remember going into next fall that weâll need to get vaccinated again for the upcoming season,â she said.

Until Wednesday, testing for H5N1 in dairy herds was voluntary and limited to cows with certain symptoms. The number of tests per farm was limited, too. That protocol provoked sharp criticism from public health experts. With growing evidence that the virus is more widespread than feared among cows, the USDA finally announced that lactating dairy cows must be tested for bird flu before moving across state lines, starting Monday. Washington Post WHO Overturns Dogma on Airborne Disease Spread. The CDC Might Not Act on It. If a respiratory disease spreads through inhalation, it means that people can lower their risk of infection indoors through sometimes costly methods to clean the air, such as mechanical ventilation and using air purifiers, and wearing an N95 mask. The CDC has so far been reluctant to press for such measures, as it updates foundational guidelines on curbing airborne infections in hospitals, nursing homes, prisons, and other facilities that provide health care. KFF Health News U.S. Accuses Russia of Using Chemical Weapons in Ukraine The State Department said Russia had used chloropicrin, a poison gas widely used during World War I, against Ukrainian forces. “The use of such chemicals is not an isolated incident and is probably driven by Russian forces’ desire to dislodge Ukrainian forces from fortified positions and achieve tactical gains on the battlefield,” the State Department said. New York Times, State Department UNSCR 1540 at 20 Years Obligating all UN member states to implement measures preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, delivery systems, and related materials, particularly to non-state actors, its passage in 2004 was a historic achievement by an international community shaken by the 2001 terror attacks on the United States as well as the exposure of A.Q. Khan’s nuclear proliferation activities. Plugging a gap in international law and reinforcing existing WMD non-proliferation and disarmament treaties such as the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), the Biological and Toxin Weapons Treaty (BWC), and the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), the Resolution can claim a number of accomplishments. Stimson Center Biden Campaign Hits Trump for Saying He Would Close Pandemic Preparedness Office. In 2018, the Trump administration eliminated a pandemic preparedness task force. The National Security Council’s Global Health Security and Biodefense unit (established after the 2014-2015 Ebola outbreak) was disbanded during a reorganization of the council, with much of its staff leaving their posts or being absorbed into other units. A successor Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy (OPPR) was founded by the Biden Administration in 2022 to address failures in government response to the COVID-19 pandemic and prepare for future biosecurity challenges. President Biden’s reelection campaign criticized former President Trump on Tuesday after Trump said he would get rid of OPPR as well. The Hill Reinforcing Global Biodefense: The Case for Amending the BWC The Biological Weapons Convention is the cornerstone of the biological weapons disarmament regime, but the treaty is having difficulty keeping up with changing threats due to its decision-making process and geopolitics. The 9th Review Conference, which ended in late 2022, was far from perfect, but it provided “a glimmer of hope in an overall bleak international security environment.” This note calls for an amendment to the BWC that leverages a cooperation pillar to ensure compliance with the treaty while subsequently enhancing the legitimacy of international law, building upon a slim inertia for positive change. Rutgers Law Record (h Pandora Report) AI Could Be Tapped to Design Weapons of Mass Destruction, DHS Warns The Department of Homeland Security this week released a new report on the ways that chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear weapons could be misused via artificial intelligence, as well as new guidelines on securing critical infrastructure in the face of AI, a stipulation from President Joe Biden’s 2023 executive order on AI. NextGov, DHS MEDICAL COUNTERMEASURES Rethinking Antibodies for Infectious Diseases? The COVID-19 experience, along with lingering manufacturing and delivery concerns, is prompting a harder look at the future of antibody-based treatment and prevention for infectious diseases. IAVI Massive Amounts of H5N1 Vaccine Would Be Needed if There’s a Bird Flu Pandemic. Can We Make Enough? With a brand-new flu virus — and H5N1 definitely falls into that category for humans — everyone will be naive. So the assumption of pandemic planners is that everyone would need two doses of vaccine in the first season of vaccinating against H5N1. That math is daunting. The vast majority of Covid deaths were in older adults; there were relatively few deaths in children. But flu infections are hardest on older adults and little kids, making the pediatric cohort a priority for vaccination. In addition, the global supply of adjuvants could be a bottleneck in any effort to vaccinate the world against H5N1, experts say. STAT Pediatric Medical Countermeasures: Antidotes and Cytokines for Radiological and Nuclear Incidents and Terrorism This is the first study comparing pediatric indications and dosing for medical countermeasures among commonly used references for radiological and nuclear incidents. Children are particularly vulnerable as they live ‘closer to the ground’ which increases risk from heavier-than-air fallout, as does their propensity for physical activity and tendency to explore their environment by placing objects in their mouths. Thinner skin can potentially lead to deeper beta burns. Rapid growth and cell division can lead to an increase in risk from exposure to ionizing radiation, as well as a risk for enhanced incorporation of radioisotopes. Disaster Medicine and Public Health Preparedness Lower Dose of Mpox Vaccine is Safe and Generates Six-Week Antibody Response Equivalent to Standard Regimen NIAID sponsored a study of dose-sparing strategies to extend limited vaccine supply. The mid-stage study enrolled 225 adults aged 18 to 50 years in the United States who had not previously been vaccinated against mpox or smallpox. NIH Genetic Basis of Clarithromycin Resistance in Bacillus anthracis Clarithromycin is an antibiotic recommended for the treatment and post-exposure prophylaxis of anthrax by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; however, little is known about the ability of B. anthracis to develop resistance to clarithromycin or the mechanism of that resistance. Microbiology Spectrum Doxycycline, Levofloxacin, and Moxifloxacin Superior to Ciprofloxacin in Treating Anthrax Meningitis in Rabbits and NHP Efficient treatment of anthrax-related meningitis in patients poses a significant therapeutic challenge. These findings imply that while ciprofloxacin is highly effective as a post-exposure prophylactic drug, using this drug to treat symptomatic patients should be reconsidered. In contrast to ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin were highly efficacious in treating lethal anthrax-related meningitis in rabbits and NHP (levofloxacin). This difference probably results from variances in blood–brain-barrier penetration of the different fluoroquinolones. Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy BIOSECURITY + BIOPREPAREDNESS Public Health Preparedness: HHS Should Address Strategic National Stockpile Coordination Challenges Recommendations included a need for ASPR to develop standard operating procedures, outlining how and when guidance documents, such as those for requesting and receiving SNS assets, are updated; and the need to bridge jurisdictional and tribal SNS coordination issues. GAO America’s Infectious-Disease Barometer Is Off During this outbreak, experts have called for better testing and surveillance—first of avian and mammalian wildlife, now of livestock. But federal agencies have been slow to respond. Testing of dairy cows was voluntary until last week. Now groups of lactating dairy cows must be screened for the virus before they move across state lines, but by testing just 30 animals, often out of hundreds. Testing and other protections for people who work with cows have been lacking, too. The fumbles of COVID’s early days should have taught the government how valuable proactive testing, reporting, and data sharing are. What’s more, the pandemic could have taught us to prioritize high-risk groups. The Atlantic NBAF Leaders Say Research is Underway on Rift Valley Fever, Other Mosquito-Borne Viruses Nearly a year after officials cut the ribbon on the National Bio and Agro Defense Facility, science has begun. NBAF deputy director Ken Burton said Monday those activities are moving forward in phases, beginning with the lowest-risk common science practices, with research to ramp up to more advanced, mission-focused science later on. The Mercury After Downsizing Health Care for Years, Pentagon Says Medical Readiness Was a Casualty A Defense Department internal memo obtained by NPR concluded that outsourcing didn’t actually save money but did hurt readiness. The so-called “stabilization memo” directs the Pentagon to reverse course, to bring more medical care back to its hospitals on base and increase medical staff, both to keep America’s standing army fit for duty and to make sure enough military doctors and nurses are trained up for a possible future war. NPR Unveiling CBRNe and Counter-Terrorism Medicine Training in US Medical Schools All United States medical schools were examined via online curriculums and queries for academic content related to CBRNe and terrorist medical counter-measures. 15 (9.8%) medical schools offered educational content related to CBRNe and terrorist counter-measures. This is in contrast to legislation following the September 11, 2001 attacks that called for high priority for such education. Prehospital and Disaster Medicine SELECT AGENTS + PRIORITY PATHOGENS Shifting Transmission Patterns of Human Mpox in South Kivu, DR Congo Between Sept 28, 2023 and March 3, 2024, 226 suspected mpox cases were investigated in South Kivu. More than half of the cases were women (53.8%), a result that diverges from previous studies where men were predominantly affected, yet aligns with the current epidemiology of Clade I in Central Africa. It appears apparent that heterosexual transmission could be driving the transmission rates in this region, unlike homosexual transmission especially in MSM, which was the main driver for the high infection rates in 2022. The Lancet Infectious Diseases From the Pain of Ebola to the Passion to Fight Lassa “The project we’re working on is called the ENABLE study. It’s one of the largest ever epidemiological studies looking at understanding Lassa fever better. And we are just one of the countries involved, because ENABLE is a multi-national study that involves four other African countries as well as Sierra Leone. Our plan is to recruit up to a total of 5,000 participants for the study and to follow them over a period of two years so that we can deepen our understanding of the disease and the Lassa virus that causes it.” CEPI Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Virus for Clinicians Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) has a fatality rate of up to 62%. Despite its widespread range and high fatality rate, no vaccines or treatments are currently approved by regulatory agencies in the United States or Europe. Clinicians should become familiar with available diagnostic and management tools for CCHFV infections in humans. Emerging Infectious Diseases INFLUENZA What is the Pandemic Potential of Avian Influenza A(H5N1)? Although sequencing of viruses from the patient and cattle in Texas did not ring alarm bells regarding the potential of HPAI A(H5N1) clade 2.3.4.4b for sustained human transmission, the threat of a pandemic remains high, and we urge international leaders to reach an agreement on a pandemic accord before it is too late. The Lancet Infectious Diseases USDA Finally Releases Some H5N1 Sequences After Pressure from Scientific Community The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which has been under pressure from scientists both at home and abroad to share more data on the H5N1 bird flu outbreaks in dairy cows, uploaded a large number of genetic sequences of the pathogen late last Sunday. The raw data sequences are from cattle, cats, chickens, skunk, racoon, grackle, blackbird, and goose. STAT, CIDRAP USDA Says Ground Beef Tests Negative for H5N1 Bird Flu Virus The USDA Food Safety Inspection Service collected 30 samples of ground beef from retail outlets in the states with dairy cattle herds that had tested positive for H5N1 at the time of sample collection. All samples tested negative for H5N1. In addition, FSIS is currently collecting muscle samples at FSIS-inspected slaughter facilities of cull dairy cattle that have been condemned for systemic pathologies. The samples will be analyzed by APHIS using PCR to determine presence of viral particles. Reuters, APHIS Bird Flu is Infecting More Mammals. What Does That Mean for Us? Many scientists worry in particular about pigs, which are susceptible to both human and avian flu strains, providing the perfect mixing bowl for viruses to swap genes. Pigs are slaughtered when very young, and newer generations, with no prior exposure to flu, are particularly vulnerable to infections. New York Times Rapid Communication: Severe A(H1N1) Influenza Acute Encephalopathy Outbreak in Children in Italy, December 2023 to January 2024 A severe outbreak of influenza A(H1N1pdm09) infection in seven children (median age: 52 months) occurred between December 2023 and January 2024 in Tuscany, Italy. Clinical presentation ranged from milder encephalopathy to acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE) with coma and multiorgan failure; one child died. This report raises awareness for clinicians to identify and treat early acute encephalopathy caused by H1N1 influenza and serves as a reminder of severe presentations of influenza in young children and the importance of vaccination. Eurosurveillance Detection of Influenza D Antibodies in Dogs Study finds that household dogs are exposed to Influenza D virus (IDV), potentially acting as a source of infection for humans. Although IDV does not seem to cause major forms of illness in humans and is not currently regarded as an important public health threat, the possibility that some IDV strains may acquire the ability to evolve and adapt in the human host should not be disregarded. This potential risk could be higher in settings where there is more viral pressure, such as in groups with occupational exposure. Emerging Infectious Diseases Analysis of Cow, Cat H5N1 Avian Flu Samples Raises Concerns About Spread to Other Animals Microbiological examination of cow, milk, and cat samples early in the investigation of H5N1 avian flu in some of the first affected states found that the cats died shortly after they were fed raw colostrum from sick cows, highlighting the risk of spread from cows to other animals through contaminated milk. CIDRAP Bat-Borne H9N2 Influenza Virus Evades MxA Restriction and Exhibits Efficient Replication and Transmission in Ferrets Researchers show that bat H9N2 has high replication and transmission potential in ferrets, efficiently infects human lung explant cultures, and is able to evade antiviral inhibition by MxA in transgenic B6 mice. Together with its low antigenic similarity to the N2 of seasonal human strains, bat H9N2 fulfils key criteria for pre-pandemic influenza A viruses. Nature Communications Cross-Species Spill-Over Potential of H9N2 Bat Influenza A Virus In 2017, a novel influenza A virus (IAV) was isolated from an Egyptian fruit bat. In contrast to other bat influenza viruses, the virus was related to avian A(H9N2) viruses and was probably the result of a bird-to-bat transmission event. The ability of bat H9N2 to replicate in and transmit among ferrets may also allow for spread among and further adaptation to humans. Nature Communications CHEMICAL + RADIOLOGICAL THREATS Ways the Navy Can Catch Up on CBR Defense Training The U.S. Navy is far behind the other armed services in CBR defense training and readiness for two reasons: absence of formal training requirements and a failure to prioritize and enforce policy that should provide the resources needed. Most of the U.S. homeland-based Navy, including leaders and security personnel, have no current CBR defense training, knowledge, or equipment to survive, respond to, or operate in a contaminated environment. Most commanding officers have no CBR defense specialist to advise them, and ATOs receive no formal school or training to properly address CBR threats in their antiterrorism plans. A WMD attack against a U.S. naval installation would result in catastrophic casualties because few of those who work there have any recent CBR defense training or equipment. US Naval Institute Exposed to Agent Orange at US Bases, Veterans Face Cancer Without VA Compensation The powerful toxic herbicide, widely used to defoliate Southeast Asian conflict areas, was also routinely used to kill weeds at domestic military bases. Those exposed to the chemicals at the bases stateside are still waiting for benefits and, in some cases, are hitting a familiar obstacle — government opacity. In February, Veteran Affairs proposed a rule that for the first time would allow compensation for Agent Orange exposure at 17 U.S. bases in a dozen states where the herbicide was tested, used or stored. Veterans’ groups argue some locations are missing from that list. KFF Health News Philippines Working with US to Thwart Threat from Weapons of Mass Destruction DTRA has engaged the government of the Philippines in capacity building to secure and eliminate chemical weapons, precursors, and toxic industrial chemicals. TRA worked with the Department of Trade and Industry to develop a strategic trade e-licensing platform that manages the registration and authorization of dual-use and other strategic goods. The DTRA has been holding international training workshops and courses for different Philippine government agencies such as the Department of Health and Department of Agriculture in Manila to prevent, detect, and prepare for outbreaks caused by disease-causing pathogens. Manila Bulletin In silico Structures, Mass Spectra and Retention Indices Database Development for Purposes of Chemical Weapons Convention Gas chromatography (GC) hyphenated with electron ionization mass spectrometry (EI-MS) is a predominant experimental technique established by Technical Secretariat of Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) for factual findings during on-site verification activities with sampling and analysis. OPCW Central Analytical Database (OCAD) and NIST software, including AMDIS, is the crucial part of the verification procedures. The common problem inherent in such analytical banks is that reference data is limited. To bridge these data gaps different modern chemoinformatics approaches can be used on different stages of in silico database generation. International Journal of Mass Spectrometry SURVEILLANCE + DETECTION Development of a Non-Infectious Control for Viral Hemorrhagic Fever PCR Assays Assay validation is an essential component of disease surveillance testing, but can be problematic in settings where access to positive control material is limited and a safety risk for handlers.

The two capture molecules developed in this paper are different from animal immune antibodies and can be obtained by the purification of recombinant proteins. This new approach not only yields many antibodies but also saves cost and time. Although the linearity and detection limit of the new trapping molecules were not better than that of the traditional animal-specific immune antibodies, their universality and recovery rate mean that they are potential replacements.

Science Bird Flu Dolphins Wildlife Nature Study seals Animals Warning as First American Dolphin Diagnosed With Highly Pathogenic Bird Flu Published Apr 29, 2024 at 9:02 AM EDT Updated Apr 30, 2024 at 10:27 AM EDT By Robyn White Nature ReporterFOLLOW Share Copy Link ✓ Link copied to clipboard! A Florida dolphin was discovered with "highly pathogenic" bird flu, according to a study.This dolphin was the first cetacean ever recorded with the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, also known as HPAIV, in North America. This discovery, which was made by University of Florida researchers, is detailed in a paper in the online journal Communications Biology.The study examined the first U.S. finding of HPAIV in a cetacean, from when it was first detected by marine rescue teams to the diagnosis of the virus and the samples found in a postmortem exam. Scientists fear that a spread of bird flu "could be catastrophic" for cetaceans, the study said.This dolphin was first found "in distress" in March 2022 after it became stuck in a Dixie County canal. Attempts were made to rescue the animal, but it died shortly after a rescue team arrived. It was packed in ice and transported to the University of Florida.At this point, scientists did not suspect bird flu, but the postmortem showed many severe health problems, including inflammation of the brain and leptomeninges disease.

Andrea Izzotti / SyhinStas/Getty Upon further analysis, they discovered symptoms similar to those in other Florida wildlife that had been infected with the virus. Birds found with the flu also had brain inflammation, the study said.The researchers also said that in 2022 there had also been harbor seals and gray seals dying from the virus. A small amount of those that died also had neurological symptoms.The virus was first detected in North America in 2021, and since then it has been spreading across birds and other mammals. Therefore, scientists knew there was a possibility of "spillover" into other marine species such as dolphins.Eventually, after various tests, they detected the isolated virus in the dolphin's brain tissue. However, it's not known how the dolphin may have contracted the flu.

Although this virus isn't very dangerous to humans, it has caused millions of deaths in birds and other wildlife. Seals and sea lions have been the main mammals affected by the disease so far.In the U.S., the disease has been particularly widespread in marine mammals in Maine. It has also been detected in seals in Puget Sound, Washington state. It has been spreading particularly quickly in South America.It is important to understand more about the virus so scientists can potentially prevent it from spreading to other animals."This investigation was an important step in understanding this virus and is a great example where happenstance joins with curiosity, having to answer the 'why' and then seeing how the multiple groups and expertise took this to a fantastic representation of collaborative excellence," Mike Walsh, an associate professor of aquatic animal health at the University of Florida, said in a summary of the study.Do you have a tip on a science story that Newsweek should be covering?

Medscape Medical NewsNew mRNA Vaccines in Development for Cancer and InfectionsKlaus Fleck, MD May 02, 2024 00BERLIN — To date, mRNA vaccines have had their largest global presence in combating the COVID-19 pandemic. Intensive research is underway on many other potential applications for this vaccine technology, which suggests a promising future. Martina Prelog, MD, a pediatric and adolescent medicine specialist at the University Hospital of Würzburg in Germany, reported on the principles, research status, and perspectives for these vaccines at the 25th Travel and Health Forum of the Center for Travel Medicine in Berlin.To understand the future, the immunologist first examined the past. "The induction of cellular and humoral immune responses by externally injected mRNA was discovered in the 1990s," she said.Instability ChallengeSignificant hurdles in mRNA vaccinations included the instability of mRNA and the immune system's ability to identify foreign mRNA as a threat and destroy mRNA fragments. "The breakthrough toward vaccination came through Dr Katalin Karikó, who, along with Dr Drew Weissman, both of the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, discovered in 2005 that modifications of mRNA (replacing the nucleoside uridine with pseudouridine) enable better stability of mRNA, reduced immunogenicity, and higher translational capacity at the ribosomes," said Prelog.With this discovery, the two researchers paved the way for the development of mRNA vaccines against COVID-19 and other diseases. They were awarded the Nobel Prize in medicine for their discovery last year.Improved Scalability"Since 2009, mRNA vaccines have been studied as a treatment option for cancer," said Prelog. "Since 2012, they have been studied for the influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus [RSV]." Consequently, several mRNA vaccines are currently in development or in approval studies. "The mRNA technology offers the advantage of quickly and flexibly responding to new variants of pathogens and the ability to scale up production when there is high demand for a particular vaccine."Different forms and designations of mRNA vaccines are used, depending on the application and desired effect, said Prelog.In nucleoside-modified mRNA vaccines, modifications in the mRNA sequence enable the mRNA to remain in the body longer and to induce protein synthesis more effectively.Lipid nanoparticle (LNP)–encapsulated mRNA vaccines protect the coding mRNA sequences against degradation by the body's enzymes and facilitate the uptake of mRNA into cells, where it then triggers the production of the desired protein. In addition, LNPs are involved in cell stimulation and support the self-adjuvant effect of mRNA vaccines, thus eliminating the need for adjuvants.Self-amplifying mRNA vaccines include a special mRNA that replicates itself in the cell and contains a sequence for RNA replicase, in addition to the coding sequence for the protein. This composition enables increased production of the target protein without the need for a high amount of external mRNA administration. Such vaccines could trigger a longer and stronger immune response because the immune system has more time to interact with the protein.Cancer ImmunotherapyPrelog also discussed personalized vaccines for cancer immunotherapy. Personalized mRNA vaccines are tailored to the patient's genetic characteristics and antigens. They could be used in cancer immunotherapy to activate the immune system selectively against tumor cells.Multivalent mRNA vaccines contain mRNA that codes for multiple antigens rather than just one protein to generate an immune response. These vaccines could be particularly useful in fighting pathogens with variable or changing surface structures or in eliciting protection against multiple pathogens simultaneously.The technology of mRNA-encoded antibodies involves introducing mRNA into the cell, which creates light and heavy chains of antibodies. This step leads to the formation of antibodies targeted against toxins (eg, diphtheria and tetanus), animal venoms, infectious agents, or tumor cells.Genetic EngineeringPrelog also reviewed genetic engineering techniques. In regenerative therapy or protein replacement therapy, skin fibroblasts or other cells are transfected with mRNA to enable conversion into induced pluripotent stem cells. This approach avoids the risk for DNA integration into the genome and associated mutation risks.Another approach is making post-transcriptional modifications through RNA interference. For example, RNA structures can be used to inhibit the translation of disease-causing proteins. This technique is currently being tested against HIV and tumors such as melanoma.In addition, mRNA technologies can be combined with CRISPR/Cas9 technology ("gene scissors") to influence the creation of gene products even more precisely. The advantage of this technique is that mRNA is only transiently expressed, thus preventing unwanted side effects. Furthermore, mRNA is translated directly in the cytoplasm, leading to a faster initiation of gene editing.Of the numerous ongoing clinical mRNA vaccine studies, around 70% focus on infections, about 12% on cancer, and the rest on autoimmune diseases and neurodegenerative disorders, said Prelog.Research in InfectionsResearch in the fields of infectious diseases and oncology is the most advanced: mRNA vaccines against influenza and RSV are already in advanced clinical trials, Prelog told Medscape Medical News."Conventional influenza vaccines contain immunogenic surface molecules against hemagglutinin and neuraminidase in various combinations of influenza strains A and B and are produced in egg or cell cultures," she said. "This is a time-consuming manufacturing process that takes months and, particularly with the egg-based process, bears the risk of changing the vaccine strain.""Additionally, influenza viruses undergo antigenic shift and drift through recombination, thus requiring annual adjustments to the vaccines. Thus, these influenza vaccines often lose accuracy in targeting circulating seasonal influenza strains."Several mRNA vaccines being tested contain not only coding sequences against hemagglutinin and neuraminidase but also for structural proteins of influenza viruses. "These are more conserved and mutate less easily, meaning they could serve as the basis for universal pandemic influenza vaccines," said Prelog.An advantage of mRNA vaccines, she added, is the strong cellular immune response that they elicit. This response is intended to provide additional protection alongside specific antibodies. An mRNA vaccine with coding sequences for the pre-fusion protein of RSV is in phase 3 trials for approval for vaccination in patients aged 60 years and older. It shows high effectiveness even in older patients and those with comorbidities.Elaborate Purification ProcessBacterial origin plasmid DNA is used to produce mRNA vaccines. The mRNA vaccines for COVID-19 raised concerns that production-related DNA residues could pose a safety risk and cause autoimmune diseases.These vaccines "typically undergo a very elaborate purification process," said Prelog. "This involves enzymatic digestion with DNase to fragment and deplete plasmid DNA, followed by purification using chromatography columns, so that no safety-relevant DNA fragments should remain afterward."Thus, the Paul-Ehrlich-Institut also pointed out the very small, fragmented plasmid DNA residues of bacterial origin in mRNA COVID-19 vaccines pose no risk, unlike residual DNA from animal cell culture might pose in other vaccines.Prevention and TherapyIn addition to the numerous advantages of mRNA vaccines (such as rapid adaptability to new or mutated pathogens, scalability, rapid production capability, self-adjuvant effect, strong induction of cellular immune responses, and safety), there are also challenges in RNA technology as a preventive and therapeutic measure, according to Prelog."Stability and storability, as well as the costs of new vaccine developments, play a role, as do the long-term effects regarding the persistence of antibody and cellular responses," she said. The COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, for example, showed a well-maintained cellular immune response despite a tendency toward a rapid decline in humoral immune response."The experience with COVID-19 mRNA vaccines and the new vaccine developments based on mRNA technology give hope for an efficient and safe preventive and therapeutic use, particularly in the fields of infectious diseases and oncology," Prelog concluded.This story was translated from the Medscape German edition using several editorial tools, including AI, as part of the process.

In the near term, prices may remain choppy as buyers of dairy products see no reason to become concerned over supply,” Schmahl said.As of midweek, U.S. dairy cattle sale prices and demand remained steady.On April 27, USDA clarified that its testing order did not apply to the interstate movement of dairy cattle animals to a sale barn. These movements require a certificate of veterinary inspection but not influenza testing.Dairy farmers are being encouraged to practice enhanced biosecurity, monitor their cattle for signs of illness such as a decline in milk production, and immediately separate sick animals.

Abraham, a faculty member at NYITCOM's Jonesboro, Arkansas location (NYITCOM-Arkansas) and a practicing physician, explains how the virus is transmitted and whether parents should be concerned about the dairy products in their homes. What is bird flu? Bird flu, or avian influenza, infects more than 100 species of wild birds. It is rare for these strains of influenza to infect humans, although there are increasing reports of bird flu cases in other mammals such as tigers, polar bears, elephants, seals, mink, and pet dogs and cats. In birds, it causes a respiratory illness that is categorized as either highly pathogenic or low pathogenic. Pathogenicity relates to how sick the infected animal is, and highly pathogenic avian influenza has the ability to spread beyond the respiratory tract to infect multiple organs, often resulting in death in birds within 48 hours. How does it spread? Birds, including wild birds and farmed and industrial poultry, spread avian influenza in nasal mucus, saliva, and feces. Avian influenza is very contagious in birds, and wild birds can infect domesticated birds and vice versa. Migratory birds distribute the infections globally, making prevention extremely difficult. Infections spread rapidly in dense populations, for example in industrial poultry growers. In 2022, an outbreak in the U.S. killed more than 50 million chickens, not including many more million that were killed (culled) by farmers to prevent spread. There have been two human avian influenza documented in the U.S. Both cases had extensive exposure to infected mammals and the spread in the mammals listed above has been occurring more frequently and widespread over the last several years. Spread to mammals other than humans appears to occur after eating infected birds. Why is the virus now being discovered in cow's milk? The genes of influenza viruses frequently mix in each animal that is infected with different strains of the virus. This gene mixing, or recombination, can result in influenza viruses that are able to act in new ways, for example, infect new species, cause new symptoms, and worsen the severity of illness. Presumably, a recent recombination event has made an avian influenza transmissible to and between domesticated cattle. Since this is a highly pathogenic strain (H5N1), it is not surprising that the virus is spreading beyond the respiratory tract into mammary glands and thus cow's milk. Since pasteurization destroys influenza viruses, it's also not surprising to find fragments of the virus in milk, but these fragments contain too little of the virus to cause illness or spread infection. H5N1 influenza is not the only virus that can have fragments present in cow's milk, and that is why pasteurization is so important. What might this discovery tell us about disease transmission? Influenza has a complicated replication cycle within multiple species that frequently causes recombination events. Even those influenza viruses that normally infect humans (not avian influenzas) begin their replication cycles in birds and pigs. The new abilities gained by viruses after recombination events can contribute to the spread among new species and this is apparently what has occurred this year in domesticated cattle. Not only has H5N1 gained the ability to infect and spread beyond the respiratory tract in cattle, but it has also gained the ability to spread among cattle to infect the herd. Related StoriesStudy reveals how COVID-19 affected the spread and evolution of seasonal influenzaStudy reveals high effectiveness of flu vaccines in children but highlights challenges with certain subtypesBird flu cases are going undetected, new study suggests. It’s a problem for all of us.The outbreak is spreading rapidly in the U.S. This is very worrisome. The more cattle that are infected, the more recombination events occur. If the right recombination event or series of recombination events increases the severity of illness or death rate in cattle, the supply of dairy products and beef would likely be affected. Should parents be alarmed, and are there any proactive steps they can take? There is so far no evidence to suggest that pasteurized cow's milk or dairy products are unsafe for humans. Certainly, everyone should avoid unpasteurized milk or dairy products. This is especially true in newborns, those with suppressed immune systems, and those who are pregnant. There is a lot we don't know, and parents should stay alert for notifications from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as recommendations may change based on newly available information. Dogs and cats should not eat wild birds, especially waterfowl, although the risk to hunting dogs appears low. A frightening scenario would be a recombination event that allows H5N1 to cause severe illness and spread rapidly in people, which would have the potential to cause a pandemic. Thankfully, this has not occurred.

Provincial data shows 167 people died of influenza during the 2023-24 flu season, eclipsing all other seasons dating back to 2009.167 Albertans have died of influenza so far this flu seasonJennifer Lee · CBC News · Posted: Apr 29, 2024 8:00 AM EDT | Last Updated: April 29According to infectious diseases specialist Dr. Lynora Saxinger, this year's high flu death toll really sticks out compared to other years. (Shutterstock)Social SharingAlberta is emerging from its deadliest flu season in 15 years.Provincial data shows 167 people died of influenza during the 2023-24 flu season, eclipsing all other seasons dating back to 2009.This season's death toll more than tripled the 2018-19 season total and nearly doubled the prior year. Last season, which was the previous high, saw 123 influenza deaths.The influenza death rate (the number of deaths for every 100,000 people) is also the worst in years."That is genuinely a very high death toll in a flu season. It really does stick out compared to other years," said Dr. Lynora Saxinger, an infectious diseases specialist at the University of Alberta.Severe cases started surging very early and vaccine uptake was sluggish from the start, she said."We had a combination of a really aggressive influenza season start and then kind of a relatively slow start to vaccine uptake, including in the highest-risk group, which are those who are over 75. So I think that was some really bad timing."The main driver of this season was H1N1, a type of influenza A, that can hit young and middle-aged adults hard but ultimately remains most deadly for older people, according to Saxinger."Coupled with the fact that most people didn't get influenza vaccination as much as usual over the pandemic period, I think that people's immune systems were a little bit caught unawares by the H1N1 strain that was coming through. It is in all the vaccines," she said.Alberta Health said a variety of factors can influence the severity of an influenza season, including the dominant strain.It also said flu death surveillance has increased since the COVID-19 pandemic began. Now all deaths that occur within 60 days of a lab-confirmed influenza case are followed up in a systematic way.Public health also began tracking community deaths, in addition to hospital deaths, during the 2020-21 season. However community deaths account for a small proportion of the totals — between five and seven deaths in each of the last three seasons.Flu death data prior to 2009 is not publicly available and does not appear to have been tracked in the same way.Low vaccination ratesAlberta's respiratory virus dashboard shows 25.1 per cent of Albertans received their flu shot this season, the lowest vaccination rate in the last decade."That is our single best tool at preventing loss of life and preventing hospitalizations. And it's clearly a tool we did not use to its maximum capacity this year," said Craig Jenne, a professor in the department of microbiology, immunology and infectious diseases at the U of C."As a result we see unfortunately a record loss of life in the province." Flu vaccine uptake plummets in Alberta as experts call for strong messaging from province This death toll, according to Jenne, should serve as a wake-up call for Alberta."I think it's data we're going to have to take a good hard look at once the flu season is over and figure out how we can better prepare ourselves or avoid this scenario in the coming seasons," he said."Part of that may be a hard look at our influenza campaign. We do know that flu shot numbers were down this year compared to really the last decade or more."Alberta's respiratory virus dashboard shows 25.1 per cent of Albertans received their flu shot this season, the lowest vaccination rate in the last decade. (Doug Ives/The Canadian Press)According to Saxinger, that preparation should include getting shots in arms earlier."This was really going up very aggressively in October, and we didn't even have vaccine supply when things were really starting to warm up," she said."We have to make sure the whole system is primed to deploy vaccines as quickly as they're available, and really try to focus on the outreach to high-risk groups and try to start socializing the idea about the fall flu shot again." Premier responds to Globe and Mail report that province directed AHS to remove COVID, flu references in ads Alberta Health said that, while overall vaccination rates have declined in recent years, immunization coverage for seniors, who have a higher risk of severe illness and death, remained relatively stable.Provincial data shows 59.4 per cent of Albertans age 65 and older received their flu shot this season.Albertans over the age of 60 accounted for 131 of the 167 deaths this season.Two children, between the ages of one and nine, also died.ABOUT THE AUTHORJennifer LeeReporterJennifer Lee is a CBC News reporter based in Calgary.

ByZarafshan Shiraz, New Delhi May 03, 2024 08:10 PM IST Read this news in brief form Share Via Copy Link Parents should not skip the flu vaccination for children, fearing side effects. Here's why flu vaccines are needed before summer ends and rainy season begins? As the flu season approaches, experts are advocating annual Influenza vaccination for all children aged 6 months to 5 years of age as it is a known fact that the symptoms of influenza virus and Covid-19 tend to mimic each other, leading to fear and anxiety among parents of young children. The flu shot acts as a vital defense, significantly reducing the risk of influenza-related complications in children so, read on as we help you to understand the importance of flu vaccination for children before monsoon. Why flu vaccines are needed before summer ends and rainy season begins? (Image by Freepik) In an interview with HT Lifestyle, Dr Anish Pillai, Lead Consultant- Neonatology and Paediatrics at Motherhood Hospitals in Kharghar and Navi Mumbai, shared, “Even though monsoon is known to provide that much-needed relief from the scorching summer heat, it is known to set the stage for a plethora of health problems, one of them being the ‘common cold’ or flu infection. Flu cases in children are common in every household during the rainy season. Thus, managing a child with runny nose, cough, and fever has become a part and parcel of a parent’s life.” Why flu vaccinations are important for children?Dr Anish Pillai answered, “Influenza or flu is a contagious viral infection that takes a toll on the airways and lungs of a child and is the most common respiratory illness seen in children during monsoon. Flu leads to discomfort, and school absenteeism in children and impacts their quality of life. Also, some children may encounter severe symptoms such as breathlessness, hypoxia, irritability, and decreased appetite, requiring hospital admission. The flu virus spreads through the droplets released when a patient with flu tends to cough, sneeze or even talk. Hence, by being around an infected person, one can be at a greater risk of acquiring the flu.” He explained, “The droplets in the air can spread up to about 7 feet away and reach others who are in the vicinity. So, for kids going to daycare or school, the monsoon season becomes a constant cycle of repeated flu infections and recovery. The flu vaccine not only protects the child but also shields those around them, including older family members and classmates. Flu vaccines are meticulously developed each year to target prevalent strains, ensuring best protection. The traditional flu shot contains inactivated (killed) flu viruses (influenza A and B), making it extremely safe and efficacious.” Dr Anish Pillai elaborated, “Parents should not skip the flu vaccination fearing side effects, as they are minimal in the form of fever, headache and swelling for a day or two at the injection site. Getting vaccinated against Influenza annually will boost immunity and prevent severe symptoms or complications. So, parents, what are you waiting for? Schedule an appointment with the Pediatrician today and get your child vaccinated without any further delay to help him/her have a healthy monsoon. Other measures: To prevent flu, parents should teach children to cover their mouth and nose while coughing/ sneezing, wash hands regularly, maintain a safe distance from people, wear a mask if unwell, avoid crowded places or being around sick people and eat a nutritious diet to boost immunity.” Catch every big hit,...

Authorities have warned of more serious respiratory diseases coming.The Centre for Health Protection warned on Tuesday that the dominating flu virus strain might change for a second time given the higher rate of travel by residents, possibly extending a flu season that was already longer than usual.“For those who haven’t been vaccinated yet, they should receive the vaccination, as the vaccine is safe and effective,” said Dr Wong Hoi-kei, senior medical and health officer of the centre’s communicable disease branch.The Centre for Health Protection has warned that the dominating flu virus strain might change for a second time, possibly extending flu season longer than usual.

In the past two weeks, two other girls, aged eight and six, also died after contracting the flu, while a three-year-old girl with the virus is fighting for her life in Queen Elizabeth Hospital.Eighteen other children have developed severe flu conditions in the current season, and most did not receive the latest flu vaccine.The three fatalities compare with one or two children dying from flu in the peak periods from 2017-18 to last year.Researcher says Covid-19 can cause ‘brain fog’, lower IQWong stressed vaccination could reduce the risk of hospitalisation by 40 to 60 per cent. But according to the latest figures, about 20 per cent of residents of homes for the elderly and nearly half of children and those aged 65 or above had not yet been vaccinated.Dr Chuang Shuk-kwan, head of the centre’s communicable disease branch, warned that the city’s flu season, which started in early January and was entering its 16th week, could last even longer due to changes in the dominating flu strain.“The strain of the virus has shifted from influenza A subtype H3 to subtype H1,” she said. “We may have another round of infection that is expected to take a few weeks. But it is difficult to predict how long the flu season will last.”Dr Chuang Shuk-kwan, head of the Centre for Health Protection’s communicable disease branch, said the city’s flu season, which started in early January, was entering its 16th week. Photo: Yik Yeung-manShe could not rule out further changes given influenza B viruses dominated in certain overseas locations and residents were travelling frequently.But there was no need to adopt special measures over the “golden week” holiday that would begin on Wednesday, Chuang said.Authorities were already conducting temperature checks at crossing points and transferring travellers to hospital if necessary, she noted.Why so many young Hongkongers continue to mask upHong Kong’s flu season usually lasts eight to 12 weeks, but Chuang said the timing during the first one or two years after the Covid-19 pandemic ended had been unstable. For example, the summer flu season, which usually took place in July and August, spanned August to October last year.Health officials said flu and Covid-19 cases remained at a high level.Dr Larry Lee Lap-yip, a chief manager at the Hospital Authority, also noted that there had been growing pressure on paediatric wards, with occupancy rates hovering around 110 per cent in recent days.Visits to accident and emergency departments, as well as occupancy rates in medical wards, were also at a high level.Dr Larry Lee Lap-yip, a chief manager at the Hospital Authority, said there had been growing pressure on paediatric wards. Photo: Edmond SoThe authority would increase the number of beds in paediatric wards if needed, and older children would be transferred to free up space for younger ones, Lee said.The four-year-old girl who died on Monday developed a fever and sore throat last Thursday.She was admitted to a private hospital the next day and was later sent to Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital in a critical condition on Saturday, but her condition continued to deteriorate.Researcher says Covid-19 can cause ‘brain fog’, lower IQChuang said overseas academic literature indicated that while personal health conditions and heredity factors might make a person more prone to serious infection, vaccination could still offer certain protection.Dr Mike Kwan Yat-wah, an honorary associate professor at the University of Hong Kong’s department of paediatrics and adolescent medicine, warned that the flu season could become year-long if shifts in dominating strains continued to prolong it.While Hong Kong ordered schools to close to curb flu outbreaks in 2018 and 2019, Kwan said he did not agree with such moves nowThe Hospital Authority has said they will increase the number of beds in paediatric wards if needed.

Read our privacy policyHealth and agriculture officials in America are ramping up testing and tracking of bird flu in dairy cows in an urgent effort to stop the growing outbreak. So far, the risk to humans remains low, officials said, but scientists are wary that the virus could change to spread more easily among people. A fifth of the US milk supply contains traces of bird flu, the FDA said (Getty Images)The virus, known as Type A H5N1, has been detected in nearly three dozen dairy herds in eight states. Inactive viral remnants have been found in grocery store milk. Tests also show the virus is spreading between cows, including those that don't show symptoms, and between cows and birds, according to the US Department of Agriculture. Starting Monday, hundreds of thousands of lactating dairy cows in the US will have to be tested — with negative results — before they can be moved between states, under terms of a new federal order. Why is this outbreak so unusual?This strain of what's known as highly pathogenic avian influenza has been circulating in wild birds for decades. In recent years, it has been detected in scores of mammals around the world. Most have been wild animals, such as foxes and bears, that ate sick or dying birds. But it's also appeared in farmed minks. It's shown up in aquatic mammals, such as harbor seals and porpoises, too. The virus was even found in a polar bear in northern Alaska. A fifth of the US milk supply contains traces of bird flu, the FDA said (Getty Images)The virus was discovered in ruminants — goats and then dairy cows — in the US this spring, surprising many scientists who have studied it for years. “When we think of influenza A, cows are not typically in that conversation,” said Richard Webby, an influenza expert at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital.Flu viruses are notorious for adapting to spread among new species, so detection in dairy cows raises concerns it could spread to people, Webby said. How long has bird flu been in cows?Scientists confirmed the virus in cows in March after weeks of reports from dairy farms that the animals were falling ill. Symptoms included lethargy, sharply reduced milk supply and changes to the milk, which became thick and yellow. Finding remnants of the virus in milk on the market “suggests that this has been going on longer, and is more widespread, than we have previously recognized,” said Matthew Aliota, a veterinary medicine researcher at the University of Minnesota.Under pressure from scientists, USDA officials released new genetic data about the outbreak this week. The data omitted some information about when and where samples were collected, but showed that the virus likely was spread by birds to cattle late last year, said Michael Worobey, an evolutionary biologist with the University of Arizona. Since then, it has spread among cattle and among farms, likely through contact with physical objects such as workers' shoes, trucks or milking machines, Worobey said. And then the cows spread the virus back to birds, he said. “The genetic evidence is as clear as could be,” Worobey said. "Birds that are sampled on these farms have viruses with clear mammalian adaptations." What have scientists sais?Several experts said the USDA's plans to require testing in cows are a good start.Bird Flu Livestock (Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.)“We need to be able to do greater surveillance so that we know what's going on,” said Thomas Friedrich, a virology professor at the University of Wisconsin's veterinary school.Worobey said the ideal would be to screen every herd. Besides looking for active infections, agriculture officials also should be looking at whether cows have antibodies to the virus, indicating past infections, he said."That is a really accessible and quick way to find out how widespread this is,” he said.More testing of workers exposed to infected animals is also crucial, experts said. Some farm owners and some individual workers have been reluctant to work with public health officials during the outbreak, experts have said. “Increased surveillance is essentially an early warning system,” Aliota said. “It helps to characterize the scope of the problem, but also to head off potentially adverse consequences."How big a risk is bird flu on people?Scientists are working to analyze more samples of retail milk to confirm that pasteurization, or heat-treating, kills the H5N1 virus, said Dr. Don Prater, acting director of the FDA's food safety center. Those results are expected soon. While the general public doesn't need to worry about drinking pasteurized milk, experts said they should avoid raw or unpasteurized milk. Also, dairy farm workers should consider extra precautions, such as masking, hand washing and changing work clothes, Aliota said.So far, 23 people have been tested for the virus during the outbreak in dairy cows, with one person testing positive for a mild eye infection, CDC officials said. At least 44 people who were exposed to infected animals in the current outbreak are being monitored for symptoms. What next?David O’Connor, a virology expert at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, likened recent bird flu developments to a tornado watch versus a warning.“There are some of the ingredients that would be necessary for there to be a threat, but we’re not there,” he said. As with a tornado watch, "you wouldn’t change anything about how you live your daily life, but you would maybe just have a bit of increased awareness that something is happening.”Worobey said this is the kind of outbreak “that we were hoping, after COVID, would not go unnoticed. But it has." He said ambitious screening is needed "to detect things like this very quickly, and potentially nip them in the bud.”More aboutCowsSymptomsCovidbird fluMilk1/3More cows are being tested and tracked for bird fluMore cows are being tested and tracked for bird fluA fifth of the US milk supply contains traces of bird flu, the FDA saidGetty ImagesMore cows are being tested and tracked for bird fluA fifth of the US milk supply contains traces of bird flu, the FDA saidGetty ImagesMore cows are being tested and tracked for bird fluBird Flu LivestockCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

But now’s a really bad time as bird flu infects cows By Helen Branswell April 29, 2024 Reprints Robert F. Bukaty/AP Scientists who know about the types of pathogens — E. coli and Salmonella among them — that can be transmitted in raw milk generally think drinking unpasteurized milk is a bad idea. But right now, they believe, the danger associated with raw milk may have gone to a whole new level. “If I were in charge, for the moment I would forbid the selling of raw milk,” said Thijs Kuiken, a pathologist in the department of viroscience at Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, who has done research on H5N1 and the damage it inflicts for about two decades. H5N1 bird flu has been circulating in dairy cow herds in multiple parts of the country, likely for months now. Testing of milk from infected cows shows the virus is present in concentrations that have taken scientists by surprise. They worry that if a raw-milk consumer inadvertently drank milk from infected cows, the results could be bad — potentially really bad.advertisement “I absolutely wouldn’t go anywhere near raw milk in terms of consuming it,” said Richard Webby, an influenza virologist at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn., whose laboratories have been involved in testing to see if evidence of H5N1 RNA can be found in commercially purchased milk — it can — and whether live virus can be grown from pasteurized milk containing H5N1 RNA. So far it looks like the answer to that question is no. Further readingDeeper look: H5N1 bird flu Genetic analysis suggests the H5N1 flu virus outbreak in cows likely started earlier than originally thought. Video explainer: Traces of the avian flu virus have been found in grocery store milk. Here's what we know about pasteurization, the H5N1 virus, and consumer safety. In a widespread bird flu pandemic, could the world produce enough H5N1 vaccine to protect the entire population? A look at lessons in preparedness from Covid-19. STAT First Opinion essay: Humans have no natural immunity to the H5N1 virus. The discovery of avian flu in U.S. cattle is a wake-up call to action. While the Food and Drug Administration bans the interstate sale and distribution of raw milk, rules surrounding its use in an individual state are set by the state legislature. Some ban the sale of raw milk for human consumption; others allow it under a variety of circumstances. (A state-by-state rundown is here.) Kuiken said his concern about the risk that infected raw milk poses is not so much that the practice might somehow help the virus to mutate in ways that would allow it to spread easily to and among people — in other words, trigger a pandemic. But he believes it would likely seriously sicken people who drink raw milk from an H5N1-infected cow. Reports of the amount of virus present in infected udders is higher than anything he’s seen in studies where he’s experimentally infected animals with H5N1 to chart the illness the virus wreaked, Kuiken said.advertisement Jürgen Richt, a veterinarian and director of the Center of Excellence for Emerging and Zoonotic Animal Diseases at Kansas State University’s College of Veterinary Medicine, spoke with a note of disbelief in his voice about the amount of dead viruses or viral particles being found in commercial milk that tested positive for the virus. “From [results] I have seen, I wouldn’t want to drink raw milk,” Richt said. “And I wouldn’t feed it to my cats, nor my dogs, nor my calves, if I’m on a farm.” The FDA is urging consumers not to drink raw milk or eat raw milk cheeses. That is a position the agency has long held, because of the other health risks these products hold, but it has re-emphasized it in the current context. It has also recommended the dairy industry not “manufacture or sell raw milk or raw milk products, including raw milk cheese, made with milk from cows showing symptoms of illness, including those infected with avian influenza viruses or exposed to those infected with avian influenza viruses.” Kuiken said he is less concerned about raw milk cheeses, saying the various processes involved in cheesemaking are “not conducive to survival of infectious virus.” He did suggest, though, that raw milk cheesemakers could be at risk, if they were inadvertently using milk laced with H5N1 virus. Related: Cattle testing for H5N1 bird flu will be more limited than USDA initially announced Whether herds owned by farmers who sell raw milk have been infected by the virus isn’t publicly known. While authorities and scientists believe outbreaks are occurring over a much broader swathe of the country than has been detected, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has only confirmed infections of 34 herds in nine states — Texas, Kansas, Michigan, New Mexico, Idaho, Ohio, South Dakota, North Carolina, and Colorado. It has not given any details about the operations on which infected animals were found. But the USDA has admitted some farmers have been refusing to test their animals. And analysis of the genetic sequences of viruses retrieved from cows combined with evidence of H5N1 RNA in commercial milk found in a number of U.S. markets — the FDA said Thursday that about 1 in 5 samples tested for H5N1 from across the country have been positive — bolster the argument that this has been going on for longer than has been recognized and likely involves far more herds than have tested positive. The testing of commercial milk was done by polymerase chain reaction, or PCR. In PCR testing, the concentration of a pathogen is estimated by how many cycles the test has to run to find it. The lower the cycle threshold — known as a “Ct value” — the higher the concentration. Anything with a cycle threshold of 29 or lower is considered a strongly positive result. Some milk testing has shown a Ct value of below 10, Kuiken said. Webby, who is also the director of the World Health Organization’s Collaborating Center for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals (located at St. Jude), said drinking raw milk that is infected with H5N1 could deliver a whopping dose of virus to a person’s system — enough to trigger a fatal infection in lab studies where small animals are experimentally infected with H5N1. “Of course, we don’t know what a lethal dose, or even infectious dose, is in humans. But it makes absolutely no sense to me that you’d want to try,” he said.

Privacy Policy We think of flu viruses as pests that plague our upper and sometimes lower respiratory tracts, causing congestion, sneezing, fever, coughing, and in some cases triggering pneumonia. Because of their biology, the influenza A viruses that routinely transmit among people — H1N1 and H3N2 — are effectively limited to infecting the cells in the respiratory tract, said Florian Krammer, an influenza virologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. But H5N1 has more tricks up its sleeve than seasonal flu viruses do; it can infect organs other than the lungs. Kuiken noted that the virus has been seen to move into the liver, the central nervous system and the brain, among other tissues. He saw the latter when he experimentally infected cats in the mid-2000s. Similar results were seen when baby goats were infected with the virus on a Minnesota farm in March. Ten of the kids died; necropsies on five of them showed virus in the brains and other organs. Many of the animal species infected in the wild have been reported to sustain damage outside of the respiratory tract. It’s believed these animals — bears, raccoons, seals, foxes, and a raft of other mammals — became infected by eating sick or dead wild birds or poultry infected with the virus. “So many, many species, they get a brain infection and brain disease, not a pulmonary disease,” Kuiken said. “In some cases the disease is missed because people are expecting pneumonia. If the animal is found dead, they don’t see the neurologic signs, and they forget to test the brain.” Human infection with flu occurs when people breathe viruses emitted by others into their upper respiratory tracts. But the shared real estate of the top of the respiratory and gastric tracts make it impossible to rule out the possibility that ingestion of food or drink that contained high levels of viable H5N1 virus could trigger infection, scientists said. Krammer said there are several mechanisms that could come into play. “You could get infection of cells in the upper respiratory tract that could go down and cause lower respiratory tract infection. There could be a route where it’s really going to the olfactory bulb,” he said, going from there to the brain. “And there’s the other option that it really makes it through the stomach … and then you start an infection from the mid gut.” Krammer said he thought that last option was unlikely; he thinks stomach acids would inactivate the virus. But Kuiken doesn’t believe that’s necessarily true, referring to his study of H5N1 in cats. Milk acts as a buffer, he said. “It’s the perfect fluid for [virus] reaching the intestine in an infectious state.” Maria Van Kerkhove, acting head of the WHO’s department of epidemic and pandemic preparedness, pointed to another outbreak, involving another virus and another animal species — the MERS coronavirus, which spreads to people from camels — as an example of where ingestion of virus-laced milk may have triggered infection of a respiratory disease. Some cases of MERS were traced to the drinking of raw camel’s milk, Van Kerkhove said, though she noted it wasn’t generally possible to tease out whether it was the drinking of the milk or the act of milking that led to the infections. (Influenza viruses and coronaviruses belong to different families.) She acknowledged that some people take comfort from the notion that stomach acids would kill H5N1, but said it is important to look for evidence-based answers. The experts STAT spoke to for this story said it would also be prudent for public health authorities looking for possible human cases of H5N1 to cast their net broadly, given that ingestion of the virus might trigger symptoms not typically associated with influenza. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said it is monitoring emergency room data for unusual cases of flu and for conjunctivitis. (There has only been one confirmed case associated with the dairy cow outbreaks to date, a farm worker in Texas who had conjunctivitis.) “I think that’s why it’s also important to look out for all kinds of weird syndromes that might come up in the areas where there is more exposure and people have more exposure to dairy cattle,” Krammer said. “It could be neurological. It could be basically conjunctivitis. It could be more traditional respiratory infections. But also, something new could come up.” “In a way, we think we know H5, but the cow trick was completely new and we don’t know what the virus would do when it goes into humans. Maybe it does something very unexpected. There’s just not enough data to say anything conclusive. So I think people should just be watchful,” he said. Richt agreed. “Expect the unexpected. That’s the situation we deal with here.” About the Author Reprints Helen Branswell Senior Writer, Infectious Diseases Helen Branswell covers issues broadly related to infectious diseases, including outbreaks, preparedness, research, and vaccine development.

As per Healthline, the influenza virus can be classified into three main groups: A, B, C and D. Singer Nick Jonas has been diagnosed with influenza A. On Saturday (May 4), Nick, the husband of Bollywood star Priyanka Chopra Jonas, shared the disheartening news with his millions of fans. Giving the health update, the rockstar said that due to his health crisis, he will not be able to perform in Mexico this weekend. Josh Brolin will not reprise the role of Cable in Deadpool & WolverineInforming fans that he had cancelled all his performances due to health crisis in a video, he said, "Hey everybody, it's Nick here. I have some not-so-fun news to share. A couple of days ago, I started feeling kind of rough; I lost my voice when I woke up and grinded that night out...Over the last two, two and a half days, it's gotten progressively worse. I was basically in bed all day yesterday, fever, body ache, sore throat and really bad cough.''In the video, the Sucker singer said he was not feeling good for a couple of days and has lost his voice. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Jonas Brothers (@jonasbrothers) ×He said, "I just need to recover and beat these things. I'm so sorry. I hate disappointing you guys.

Why the risk to humans remains lowClara Migoya Arizona RepublicShow Caption Hide Caption USDA assures public retail meat is safe, still plans to test beef samplesIn an effort to contain the recent outbreak of bird flu, the USDA has implemented new rules for lactating dairy cows.Straight Arrow NewsA national outbreak of bird flu is spreading among dairy cows in at least nine states, but Arizona farms haven't yet detected any cases.H5N1, a strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza, is the first to make a jump from infected birds to cattle, an event evolutionary and epidemiology experts say is "unprecedented" and worrisome."Ideally, you don't want H5N1 starting to infect whole new mammalian species that we are in contact with," as this could increase the risk of a mutation that also affects humans, said Michael Worobey, a genomic epidemiology expert and head of the ecology and evolutionary biology department at the University of Arizona."I'm not alarmed by it but it certainly has opened up a new front for these viruses that, until now, had just been bird viruses."The U.S. Department of Agriculture issued a national order last week to limit the spread of the virus after a farm worker in Texas was exposed to a sick cow and developed conjunctivitis, and after researchers found inactive traces of the virus in milk, USA Today reported.Under the USDA order, all dairy cattle must be tested for avian influenza before they are moved across state lines, and labs and state veterinarians must now report all positive results in livestock.The Arizona Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory at the University of Arizona started testing last week. So far they've only received one sample, which turned out negative, said director Yan Zhang. They could perform these tests before but there weren't requests, he said. There's now funding to process the samples for free.More data is needed to limit the virus from spreading."We'd like to know exactly when, where and how this jumped into cattle, so that we might be able to prevent that from happening again," said Worobey, one of a handful of scientists worldwide analyzing genomic data from the new strain.USDA said it has found no changes to the virus "that would make it more transmissible to humans" and the current risk to the public remains low.Public health: Four reasons to be concerned (but not freak out) about the bird fluNo known cases of avian flu in Arizona cowsThe dairy cow infections began in the western Texas panhandle, where dairy farms noticed a drop in milk production after some cows stopped eating.Arizona dairy farmers have been alert for two months but haven't detected sick cows, according to one dairy farmer.The Arizona Department of Agriculture confirmed "no reports of compatible symptomology have been reported for any Arizona livestock."Casa Grande Dairy Co. Farm owner Jim Boyle said his calls with dairy associations across the West became more frequent in early March: "We went from making a call every two weeks to actually calling every week," and included state veterinarians across the West and government officials.It wasn't until mid-March that they knew it was bird flu, a novel disease.Arizona might have escaped infections because of the lack of imports, Boyle said. "Our dairies generally don't have animals raised in Texas. We raise our animals here, sometimes in California."Arizona's arid environment and lack of wetlands, where potentially infected birds could congregate, might have prevented cases too, said Robert Smook, AZDA's public information officer.The agency tightened restrictions on imports of dairy cattle starting April 3, establishing that all dairy cows must be inspected by an accredited veterinarian and have a valid certificate not within 30 days but 10 before they move across state lines. The assessment did not require an avian influenza test, only an expert evaluation.A non-deadly 'inconvenience' for dairiesCows cough and wheeze. But avian influenza is not causing any respiratory issues in dairy cattle, which is probably why it went undetected, several sources said.A cow infected with bird flu would probably lose its appetite, might be kind of constipated, and two or three days after would stop producing milk, or produce a very thick milk, Boyle explained."They certainly don't die," he said, and recover within two to three weeks, rarely needing medication. "If you go back to the area where this started in west Texas, New Mexico and Kansas, those herds are all back. All the animals are healthy again, and they're back to normal production, and it seems to not be spreading in those areas anymore."In affected states, the virus hasn't spread to the whole herd but only affected 10 to 20% of cows, he added. That means a loss in milk production overall but colleagues said it's not "super disruptive.""The concern is the human health side," the fact that the virus is in the cows blood, mucus and milk, he said.That concern so far is low. Store-bought milk is safe to drink since pasteurization is effective in destroying the virus, according to consistent testing by the Food and Drug Administration. The exposed farm worker had a minor symptom, and the Centers for Disease and Control is now testing workers on dairies where cows tested positive to avian flu.Avian flu 'flying under the radar'On April 21, USDA made public the genome sequence of the H5N1 strain, raw data that Worobey and some 25 other colleagues pulled together so they could start analyzing it."This was actually just a single jump into cattle in the U.S.," said Worobey, whose expertise, genomic epidemiology, is aimed at understanding "the origins, emergence and control of pandemics" like HIV and influenza.Results suggest that jump, from one bird to one cow, probably between November or January, went under the radar for months, he added. There hasn't been widespread testing and the virus has infected herds since, so the tally could be greater.Birds using dairy ponds likely transmitted the virus to dairy cows. Dead blackbirds and grackles on the farms, as well as barn cats, have tested positive.The virus hasn't been detected in beef cattle."I'm hoping that it's because this really is related to milk and high loads of virus in the udders, but we don't know that yet," Worobey said.The other concern is that this novel bird flu in dairy cows could become endemic, like swine flu, he added."We should hope for the best, plan for the worst," he said, "and keep a close watch on what mutations are arising in cattle."2023 outbreak: Avian flu kills 10 northern Arizona condors and officials fear the virus could spreadVirus was devastating to some wild birdsBird flu is not uncommon but this particular strain, which emerged in Europe in 2020, was very aggressive and spread to an "unprecedented number of countries," according to a scientific analysis in Nature. Birds' continental migration made it worse.Backyard birds and big poultry and egg farms were hit hard in the U.S. About 90 million chickens died or were sacrificed to stop the spread since the start of the outbreak in 2022.In Arizona, the avian influenza outbreak had "minimal direct impact" on commercial poultry and egg farms, which have "the strictest biosecurity protocols" and really "stepped up their game," said Smook with AZDA.For some wild bird species it was "pretty devastating," said Tice Supplee, director of bird conservation with Audubon Southwest.Dozens of California condors died in northern Arizona from the flu in 2023. USDA approved the emergency use of a vaccine last year to protect the endangered species, which number fewer than 300 birds in the wild, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service."The good news is that so far this year we're not seeing any outbreaks," Supplee said.Rehabilitation centers have detected some cases in hawks and owls. In Arizona, there have only been 65 recorded cases of H5N1 in wild birds, according to USDA."The virus is most frequently detected in and potentially spread by waterfowl, raptors and gulls," said Anne Justice-Allen, Arizona Game and Fish Department wildlife veterinarian."Other wild birds living around these species may be affected but for the most part, the disease has not been found in songbirds and backyard birds."The agency tests dead birds for the virus and has a statewide surveillance project with researchers at ASU.The H5N1 strain is now widespread in North and South America, and "there isn't much that can be done to contain the disease in wild birds," Justice-Allen said, but infection of dairy cattle can be prevented by keeping waterfowl away and restricting cattle access to wetlands."We don't know how the dairy cattle were infected at this time but we think it was an uncommon event or it would have happened before now. This same strain has been circulating in Europe for years."Clara Migoya covers agriculture and water issues for The Arizona Republic and azcentral.

USDA scientists say the H5N1 virus was probably spreading in cows for at least four months before it was detected. Cynthia Goldsmith/CDC CNN — Bird flu was probably circulating in dairy cows for at least four months before it was confirmed to be the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus, according to a new analysis of genomic data by scientists at the US Department of Agriculture’s Animal Disease Center. The research also found infected cattle that had no apparent connections, suggesting that “there are affected herds that have not yet been identified,” the study said. It adds to a growing pile of evidence suggesting that the H5N1 virus had a head start in the US dairy industry for months before it came to the attention of scientists and government regulators. The USDA’s study was published as a preprint, ahead of peer review, on the BioRXIV server on Wednesday. Cows are seen standing in a feedlot on June 14, 2023 in Quemado, Texas. Brandon Bell/Getty Images Related article Spikes of flu virus in wastewater raise questions about spread of bird flu It follows a similar analysis by an independent international group of almost two dozen evolutionary and molecular biologists who quickly analyzed raw genome sequences uploaded by the government to a server maintained by the National Library of Medicine. Despite the lack of critical background information on those samples, that group came to nearly the same conclusion as the USDA: that the virus had crossed over from wild birds to cows between mid-November and mid-January, which means it was circulating for months before anyone knew. The USDA officially confirmed the presence of the H5N1 virus on March 25 in dairy cows in Texas. Since then, at least three dozen infected herds have been reported across nine states. At least one farmworker who was in contact with infected cows in Texas also tested positive for H5N1, the second human case of this type of flu ever reported in the US. The worker was given antiviral medication and has recovered. Tests of milk from retail stores have shown inert remants of the virus in about 1 in 5 samples, the US Food and Drug Administration reported last week, suggesting that the infection had become widespread. Further testing by the FDA has confirmed that the virus in the samples of pasteurized dairy products was not active and couldn’t make anyone sick, but experts have strongly advised against the consumption of raw milk. “We could have done a much better job” catching H5N1 in dairy cows, said Dr. Michael Worobey, head of the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Arizona who was part of the group of biologists that conducted the independent analysis. He studies how pandemics start. Worobey said that as soon as the cows were noticeably sick with something mysterious, instead of testing for specific viruses and bacteria, ideally, a lab would have used a technique called metagenomic sequencing, which reads all the genetic material in a sample and uses computers help pick out relevant information. “If that had been done, that would have revealed H5N1 in January and then even beyond that,” he said. If we’re serious about preventing outbreaks in animals that could lead to human pandemics, Worobey said, regulators need to change their approach. “We have to get out of the mindset of waiting for that tip of the iceberg of sick animals or sick humans to be noticed.” Instead, he said, animals need to be routinely tested with “modern techniques” for identifiying emerging pathogens. The new study gives the USDA’s account of how bird flu seemed to spread so quickly to herds across the US. Samples collected between March 7 and April 8 found very similar H5N1 viruses in 26 herds in eight states and six poultry flocks in three states, suggesting that the virus had crossed over in a single spillover event between wild birds and cows. The study says “production veterinarians” first noticed cows who weren’t eating well with changes to their milk production and quality in late January. H5N1 has been devastating wild and domestic bird populations in the US since 2022, and it has infected a growing number of mammals. In addition to the movement between cattle and wild birds, the study found evidence that infected cattle had passed the virus to domestic poultry flocks “through multiple transmission routes.” The researchers also found that the virus involved in the current outbreak had infected a wild animal – a raccoon – and cats that lived near the cows on dairy farms.

Interestingly, the virus sequenced from the infected farmworker had key differences from the cow genomes. The USDA scientists concluded that the differences might mean they were missing samples from the animals the farmworker had come into contact with or could have been due to the evolution of the virus from host to host. Worobey says the study means H5N1 is “now seemingly well-entrenched in the dairy cattle population in the country” and might be something we have to deal with for years to come. Although it’s by no means clear that this virus will change in the right combination of ways to launch a human pandemic, he said, allowing a virus to get a foothold in a population of domesticated animals puts everyone at risk. “It does add one more species – a very important species – that didn’t have influenza A virus circulating in it before to the list of species where these viruses can have the opportunity to find that right combination that allows them to wreak havoc in the human population, not just animals,” he said.

On March 25, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced that avian influenza had been detected in American dairy cattle. On April 23, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration reported that the agency had detected genetic material from the bird flu virus — a form of H5N1 — in the commercial milk supply. Pasteurization has been effective at inactivating the H5N1 bird flu virus, and the viral material found in the milk has not proven to be infectious. According to the FDA, “these results reaffirm our assessment that the commercial milk supply is safe.” However, widespread appearance of the viral genetic material in grocery store milk indicates that the virus is likely more prevalent in cows than cow testing data indicate. The virus, which has been spreading among cows, both within herds and between herds as cows are transported, was detected in just 36 herds by early May, according to the USDA. Since the beginning of the cow outbreak, only one person in the U.S., a dairy worker in Texas, has tested positive for H5N1 bird flu. The virus, found in wild birds around the world, has not shown the ability to spread among humans in a sustained way. Update, Nov. 11: Since the beginning of the outbreak in dairy cattle, the CDC has confirmed 25 cases of bird flu in dairy workers and 20 cases in poultry workers. On Sept. 6, the CDC announced the first U.S. case of H5 bird flu — later confirmed to be H5N1 bird flu genetically linked to the outbreak in cows — in a person without a known exposure to an infected animal. The individual, a Missouri resident who was hospitalized in late August, has recovered. So far, there isn’t evidence that the person spread the virus to anyone else, nor do surveillance systems show unusual flu activity among people in the area. A household contact of the infected person showed some signs of prior H5N1 bird flu infection in an antibody test, although the contact was not counted as a case in the official CDC tally. The two household members developed symptoms at the same time, indicating a shared exposure rather than person-to-person spread, the CDC said. The World Health Organization currently evaluates the overall public health risk from H5N1 bird flu as low, adding that the risk is low to moderate for people exposed to “infected birds or animals or contaminated environments.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also currently rates the risk to public health as low. Still, the situation with cows has renewed concerns among infectious disease experts that H5N1 bird flu — long regarded as a threat to humans — has the potential to cause a pandemic. “This is a virus that we are concerned that could cause human infection or could lead to an epidemic-type outbreak,” Dr. Jonathan Runstadler, chair of the department of infectious disease and global health at Tufts University’s Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine, told us. “The fact that it’s getting into an agricultural animal and seems to be spreading, and that has potential implications for contamination of the food supply — all of those are reasons to be concerned about influenza and the possibility of spillover of influenza into humans.” But “right now really it’s more of an animal health issue,” Dr. Andrew Bowman, a veterinary epidemiologist at Ohio State University’s College of Veterinary Medicine, told us. “Certainly, keeping an eye towards public health, but with only one reported case in humans, and there’s been a growing number of animal detections and we haven’t seen the uptick in human detections, I think that’s probably a good sign for public health.” Below, we’ve assembled answers to some basic questions about H5N1 bird flu. How Did H5N1 Bird Flu Spread to Cows? How Is the Virus Transmitted Between Cows? How Widespread Is the Virus in Cows? Is It Safe to Drink Milk? Is the Virus Spreading in Beef Cattle? What Is the Risk of H5N1 Bird Flu Spreading to Humans? How Dangerous Is H5N1 for Humans? What Can I Do to Reduce Risks? How Did H5N1 Bird Flu Spread to Cows? The H5N1 bird flu virus likely passed to dairy cows from wild birds — perhaps via contaminated food or water — and subsequently began to spread between cows. USDA analyses, described in a May 1 preprint, indicate there was just one introduction of the virus to the cows. The virus spreading in cows belongs to a group of H5N1 bird flu viruses that has been causing substantial disease and death in wild birds and domestic poultry since 2020. This group of H5N1 viruses was first found in the U.S. in wild birds sampled in late 2021, and it caused the first outbreak in domestic poultry the following month. The virus spread to North America via wild birds migrating from Europe. As of early May 2024, nearly 91 million poultry in the U.S. had been affected, due to repeated introductions from wild birds. There was one human case linked to poultry in 2022, and the person recovered. The virus also has spread from birds to mammals various times, Bowman said, but has not become established in these animals. In the U.S., these have included at least 20 species, such as seals and a dolphin, as well as foxes, raccoons and other wild animals that would be expected to eat dead birds. The difference now is that it “seems to be maintained amongst the cattle, which is a first from what we’ve seen in mammalian spillovers,” Bowman said. “The rest of them seem to have been dead-end hosts.” When cows get sick with H5N1 bird flu, their milk production and appetite may decline; the milk may become thicker; and the cows may become lethargic and feverish, among other possible symptoms. Unlike birds, for which the virus can be widely lethal, the cows appear to recover from their illness. There is also evidence that some cows can carry the virus without having any symptoms. H5N1 bird flu has been detected in cats that were fed raw milk from infected cows. And cows appear to have spread the virus to poultry, wild birds and a raccoon. How Is the Virus Transmitted Between Cows? The movement of cattle from herd to herd has been linked to the spread of the virus. However, it is unclear exactly how H5N1 bird flu is spreading between dairy cows, Bowman and Runstadler both said. The learning curve has been complicated by the fact that cow influenza isn’t exactly a research specialty. “Why cows?” Bowman said. “Because if you’d asked probably any flu expert seven weeks ago, bovine was not a primary host of influenza.” Photo by piyaphunjun / stock.adobe.com The virus has been primarily found in milk and mammary tissue, according to the USDA, and milk is likely implicated in its spread. The virus has not been found in significant amounts in respiratory samples. In a presentation at an event hosted by the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials on April 25, Dr. Rosemary Sifford of the USDA said that no significant viral shedding had been found from the gastrointestinal tracts of cattle, based on limited samples. Bowman called the high levels of virus in the cows’ udders unprecedented. “As we think about influenza, for the most part we think about it as an upper respiratory pathogen in most mammalian species,” he said. However, he added that H5N1 bird flu has been more of a systemic disease than other flu types. One theory on transmission is that contaminated milking or other dairy equipment is spreading the virus from cow to cow. Or perhaps the virus is getting aerosolized in milk and spreading between adjacent cows, or getting into the animals’ feed, Runstadler said. “There’s a lot of different possibilities in a farm situation for transmission to occur through different routes,” he said. How Widespread Is the Virus in Cows? It is also uncertain when the virus spread to cows and how widespread it is, Bowman and Runstadler said. There have been reports of symptoms in dairy cows dating to late January. USDA scientists estimate that the virus spread in cows for about four months before being detected in March. Bowman said that the lack of a precedent for significant influenza in cattle may have contributed to the illness flying under the radar at first. “As a veterinarian, if I had a cow with illness, I would have never requested an influenza test,” he said. Sifford said during her April 25 presentation that USDA has flu surveillance systems set up in domestic pigs and poultry, as well as feral swine. But similar systems don’t exist in cows. “This virus seems to have spilled over into dairy cattle from birds, and one of the potential reasons why we didn’t notice it until now or haven’t noticed it is that there isn’t enough public funding that’s put into surveillance for potential zoonotic disease like this,” Runstadler said, referring to the potential for animals to spread a virus to humans. As of May 2, the USDA reported cases in 36 livestock herds in nine states. But when the FDA sampled commercial milk being sold in stores in April, it found that 1 in 5 samples contained genetic material from H5N1. Some researchers, including Bowman, have also found genetic material from the virus in milk they bought in retail settings across various states. Farmers are supposed to discard milk from sick cows, but the findings of viral genetic material in the milk supply indicate that this isn’t happening in all cases, perhaps because some cows are asymptomatic. It’s hard to tell based on commercial milk testing data exactly how many cows or even farms are affected, Bowman said. However, “it gives us the indication that it’s more widespread in the cattle herd than the reported cases so far,” he said. Starting April 29, the USDA ordered that state veterinarians and laboratories report any positive test for influenza A — which would include H5N1 cases — in livestock, and that farmers get some dairy cows tested if they are going to be transported across state lines. This should likely increase testing in dairy cattle, which is otherwise left up to the discretion of the farmers. As of Nov. 8, the virus has been detected in 491 cattle herds in 15 states, according to the USDA (see the agency’s dashboard for the latest figures). Update, Nov. 8: The USDA on Oct. 29 confirmed that a pig in a backyard farm in Oregon was infected with H5N1 bird flu. The farm also had infected poultry. This is the first time H5N1 has been detected in a pig in the U.S. Is It Safe to Drink Milk? The vast majority of milk products sold in the U.S. and all milk sold via interstate commerce is pasteurized. The available evidence shows that this family of heat treatments inactivates any H5N1 that is present. “At this point every indication is that milk is safe to drink,” Bowman said. “We’re just picking up viral genetic material. We’re not picking up viable virus.” Update, July 9: A June 14 study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that if researchers spiked milk with large amounts of H5N1, small amounts of infectious virus remained after the milk underwent one standard method of pasteurization. A press release accompanying the paper said the authors “stress, however, that their findings reflect experimental conditions in a laboratory setting and are not identical to large-scale industrial pasteurization processes for raw milk.” Results released June 28 from FDA and USDA scientists indicate that commercial pasteurization does effectively inactivate H5N1 bird flu virus in milk. The FDA strongly recommends against consuming raw milk, which isn’t pasteurized, under ordinary circumstances and has affirmed this recommendation. Researchers told STAT that this would be a particularly bad time to drink raw milk, citing the high levels of virus found in udders of infected cows, and the high levels of inactivated viral material found in commercial pasteurized milk. The FDA bans interstate raw milk sales and reports that “20 states explicitly prohibit intrastate raw milk sales in some form and 30 allow it.” The FDA is looking at the effects of pasteurization on H5N1 using various methods and in various dairy products, Dr. Donald Prater of the FDA said during the April 25 presentation. FDA testing has since shown, for instance, that viral fragments in cottage cheese and sour cream are inactive. Prater also said that the FDA is evaluating H5N1 risk in aged cheese made with raw milk, which can be sold in interstate commerce. Update, Aug. 21: The FDA and USDA have completed additional research on a broader range of dairy products sold in stores in various parts of the U.S., according to an Aug. 11 preprint. The researchers tested more pasteurized milk, as well as cheeses, butter and ice cream, purchased in June and July. They found that 17% of the sampled products had bird flu genetic material, but none of the products had any active virus. Is the Virus Spreading in Beef Cattle? So far, there’s no evidence the virus has affected beef cattle, according to the USDA. In her April 25 presentation, USDA’s Sifford said the virus likely originally spilled over from wild birds into dairy cattle due to “the management of dairy cattle being in much more confined spaces.” The access to feed and water in a confined space may have attracted wild birds. Therefore, when looking to see whether the virus might spread into beef cattle, it would make sense to look at a more confined setting where the birds could access food and water, such a feedlot, she said. The USDA reported no evidence of H5N1 in 30 samples of ground beef bought in retail settings in areas where H5N1 has been reported in dairy cows. USDA experiments also indicated that cooking ground beef patties to 160 F — the recommended temperature — inactivated the virus. In medium burgers (145 F), the virus was also inactivated, according to the USDA, and in rare burgers (120 F), the virus was “substantially inactivated.” While most beef comes from dedicated beef cattle, a small portion comes from dairy cattle. USDA testing of slaughtered dairy cows found genetic material from H5N1 bird flu in 1 out of 109 cow muscle samples. These were cows whose meat had been condemned and was not destined for the food supply. The cow that tested positive had shown signs of sickness during standard inspection after death, according to the USDA, leading USDA personnel to prevent “the animal from entering the food supply.” “USDA is confident that the meat supply is safe,” the agency says on its website. Update, Sept. 5: The USDA has announced that starting Sept. 16, it will begin routinely monitoring dairy cattle sent to slaughter for H5N1 bird flu. What Is the Risk of H5N1 Bird Flu Spreading to Humans? As we have written, WHO and the CDC say the current risk to public health is low. The virus would need to undergo various changes to easily infect and replicate in humans, and to spread between them. But the circulation of H5N1 bird flu in dairy cows raises a few concerns. One is that the cows put a new population of workers and animals in contact with H5N1 bird flu. Flu viruses trade sequences with each other, in a process called reassortment, and they also mutate over time. Contact with humans and livestock, such as pigs, may give the virus more chances to mix with other flu viruses or develop mutations that would allow it to better spread between humans. “It’s one thing to have a virus circulating out in wild birds that might be a risk,” Runstadler said. “It’s another thing to have it in a domestic agricultural animal population if it might be a risk.” “Not only is this in a new host species, but then this is a different set of farm workers,” Bowman said, explaining that pig and poultry farmers are well versed in flu protection measures but that occupational health recommendations for dairy workers have not historically included such measures. Given that it’s uncertain exactly how the cows are transmitting H5N1, it’s unclear what precautions dairy workers need to take, Bowman said. But the CDC has recommended new procedures for people working in the cattle industry, particularly those exposed to infected cows. Another concern is that H5N1 bird flu may become better adapted to mammals as it circulates in cows, which could in turn help the virus gain a foothold in people or other mammals. Researchers are monitoring H5N1 from cows to better understand if it has developed mutations “that would suggest that it’s better adapted to causing disease in a mammalian host,” Runstadler said. Vivien Dugan, director of the influenza division at the CDC, told STAT that “we’ve not seen anything that would be concerning to us for mammalian adaptation, at this point.” So far, there aren’t any signs that the virus is spreading widely among humans. The CDC has flu surveillance systems that detect influenza A, the general family of flu that H5N1 bird flu is a part of. The rate of influenza A in health care settings is decreasing as flu season ends. CDC also does surveillance for unusual subtypes of flu, and routine testing for flu should also detect if an unusual type of flu is circulating. However, it is difficult to know how many other cases there are beyond just the single one detected in the Texas dairy worker, Bowman said. “I think we generally accept the idea that there are more cases than reported cases, always,” he said. There are anecdotes of sick dairy workers who did not get testing. There are multiple known barriers that could keep workers from getting testing, such as low wages and poor benefits, undocumented status, or speaking a language other than English as a first language. Update, Nov. 11: A CDC study published Nov. 7 found that of 115 surveyed dairy workers on farms in Michigan and Colorado with H5N1 bird flu outbreaks, eight had bird flu-specific antibodies, indicating a recent infection. Four of these workers recalled having symptoms around the time cows on their farms were sick. Workers were more likely to have a positive antibody test if they reported having cleaned the milking parlor; many who tested positive also had milked cows. How Dangerous Is H5N1 for Humans? Bowman emphasized that H5N1 comprises a broad group of viruses that has changed over time. Looking at people who have gotten H5N1 bird flu since 2003, mainly via animal exposures, the virus has a case fatality rate of more than 50%, representing 463 deaths out of 888 known cases. But this doesn’t necessarily apply to the current situation. “The H5N1 viruses that were historically responsible for that 50% case fatality rate — this is a different version,” Bowman said. Thus far, the one American known to be infected by cows only suffered from pinkeye and recovered. The other American who got H5N1 bird flu since it began spreading among wild birds in the U.S. in late 2021 also had mild disease and recovered. Update, Nov. 11: As of Nov. 8, there have been 46 people in the U.S. diagnosed with H5N1 bird flu in 2024. No cases have been severe, and many involved infection of the eye. An August case in a Missouri resident was diagnosed while the patient, who had underlying health problems, was hospitalized. The patient has recovered. Case fatality rates simply show what percentage of people known to be infected died. They don’t show the percentage of the total number of infected people who die. People who are asymptomatic or only mildly ill may not get testing. Finally, it’s unknown what other changes H5N1 might undergo if it did develop the ability to spread well in humans. It could become more lethal, or it could become less lethal. If H5N1 did begin spreading between humans, some treatments and vaccines would likely be available. The CDC has confirmed that the version of H5N1 bird flu that infected the Texas dairy worker should be susceptible to available antiviral flu medications and recommends treating people who are exposed or infected with oseltamivir, otherwise known as Tamiflu. The U.S. has a stockpile of vaccines previously developed to protect against H5 influenza viruses. The CDC says these are expected to provide some protection against the version of the virus currently spreading in cattle, should they become necessary. However, there would likely be challenges in scaling up vaccine production to vaccinate people around the world. People also may have some immunity to part of the virus from the H1N1 swine flu pandemic virus, as well as some vaccines, but the degree to which this would be helpful is unclear. What Can I Do to Reduce Risks? As we’ve said, the CDC recommends specific precautions for people working with livestock, including people with backyard birds, such as chickens. These include wearing appropriate gear when dealing with potentially infected animals or materials. The CDC also recommends a few general precautions. These include keeping one’s distance from wild birds and avoiding contact with substances like bird poop that could be contaminated. People should also avoid contact with sick or dead animals, whether domestic or wild, and look into policies for reporting dead birds in their area. Researchers suggest keeping pets away from animals that could be infected, including in urban areas. The CDC also recommends following normal food safety practices, such as properly cooking poultry, eggs and beef, and avoiding raw milk and raw milk products. Finally, the agency says that it’s important to get annual seasonal flu shots. If a person is infected with an ordinary human flu virus and becomes infected with H5N1 at the same time, the viruses could mix together and undergo reassortment, potentially leading to a virus better positioned to replicate in people. Update, May 31: This story has been edited to reflect new data from USDA experiments on the effectiveness of cooking to inactivate H5N1 in ground beef, as well as a new USDA finding of H5N1 genetic material in the tissue of a condemned, slaughtered dairy cow.

Photo: Althea Dotzour In the last few months, the same strain of bird flu virus that has been circulating since 2022 has spread to dairy herds, with confirmed infections in at least nine states. As part of efforts to track and minimize the spread of the virus, known as Type A H5N1, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced a new requirement for testing of lactating cows prior to their transport across state lines. Although genetic fragments of the H5N1 bird flu are being found in the commercial milk supply, pasteurized products are still safe to consume as far as experts can tell. The virus, which has primarily spread via infected migratory birds, has also infected mammals such as cows, foxes and sea lions. There has also been a report of the virus spreading to a commercial poultry flock on a farm with an infected dairy herd. Meanwhile, one dairy worker exposed to an infected herd in Texas came down with a mild case of conjunctivitis, but no other H5N1 infections have been reported in humans in the United States as of the end of April 2024. Researchers are keeping a close eye on the virus and its spread and are analyzing infected raw milk to understand what risks may exist. More research is underway to determine whether the virus is spreading from mammal to mammal, if it spreads through means other than respiratory, and how widespread it is in dairy herds. Experts at the University of Wisconsin–Madison are assisting these efforts with an eye toward minimizing risk to human health and protecting the state’s agricultural sector. We touched base with several of those experts to get an idea of what scientists know so far about the developing outbreak, including how the virus may affect dairy products and the industry and what people may need to look out for in themselves, their herds or flocks, and their pets. Dairy industry and animal health: Keith Poulsen, director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, is one of the scientists working with federal agencies to keep the virus under control while also keeping the needs of dairy farmers and veterinarians on the front lines in mind. He’s been keeping an eye on the disease since 2022 and has been involved with monitoring the recent outbreaks in dairy cows since they first popped up earlier this year. Keith Poulsen Photo: Bryce Richter Poulsen says that the USDA’s recent testing requirement is an important measure to mitigate the virus’s spread between states. Current USDA guidance requires that each cow be tested in herds containing 30 animals or fewer, while farmers moving more than 30 animals across state lines only need to test 30 animals. An accredited veterinarian must collect or supervise the sampling. Normally, at least 50,000 dairy cows cross state lines to move throughout the country each week, Poulsen explains. With the movement of so many cows, the testing requirement could strain farmers, veterinarians and diagnostic labs. Poulsen explains that there’s a complex web of variables at play that he and his colleagues are navigating and balancing. On one hand, there’s a need to act with caution and implement a conservative approach to minimize further spread of the virus and potential risk to human health. But there are also farmers who rely on the productivity of their herds to make a living and support their families, making reporting infection and dealing with the logistics of testing difficult. “When you’re managing a multibillion-dollar industry that deals with food and public safety, we want to make sure we’re not giving out bad advice,” Poulsen explains. He’s also been working with other researchers at UW–Madison to understand what the pasteurization process does to the virus in cow’s milk, and what risks there may be to human health. Zoonotic disease and human health: Thomas Friedrich studies how viruses from animals could cross over to humans. While this strain of H5N1 avian influenza is crossing over to mammals, elevating the risk for it to continue to mutate and spread, he says that past bird flu viruses that have infected humans and other mammals have remained “pretty avian,” and not mutated to spread quickly from human to human. Thomas Friedrich For the virus to transmit more easily between humans, Friedrich explains it would need to mutate to be able to better attach to mammalian cells. Flu viruses use molecules called receptors to latch onto cells and infect them. The version of the receptor in humans’ upper airways is different from those in birds. That prevents bird flu viruses from infecting cells in humans’ noses and throats, which they would need to do to spread easily from human to human. Humans do have receptors that bird flu viruses can attach to, but those receptors and susceptible cells are only present deep in the lungs. In previous human bird flu infections, Friedrich says, the virus seemed to only infect those susceptible cells and did not mutate to infect other cells higher up in the respiratory tract that could make it more transmissible to other humans. The virus would also have to mutate to survive at the temperature of most human respiratory tracts, which tends to be lower than the avian environment in which it currently thrives. So far, Friedrich says the virus appears not to have mutated to be able to better attach to receptors in cows either. “I think the bottom line is that the danger to the public is currently minimal, but we need to keep an eye on this situation so that we understand how the virus might evolve,” Friedrich explains. David O’Connor David O’Connor is an expert in the emergence of new viruses in human populations. He agrees with Friedrich, saying that more data will help scientists keep an eye on the virus’s mutations so potential risks to human health can hopefully be mitigated. O’Connor likened the current human health risk to that of a hurricane far out at sea. No one is entirely sure if the storm will make landfall or not, but it’s best for scientists to continue monitoring and collecting as much data as they can to help everyone prepare, should the storm come. “There’s the potential for viruses that are at human-animal interfaces to cross species barriers and infect humans, but most of that is simply potential, it’s not actually happening,” O’Connor says. “Unless you are someone who works on a farm in close contact with dairy cows, and unless you’re someone who works on a poultry farm in close contact with poultry, you do not need to worry about getting bird flu.” Bird flu fragments in milk Yoshihiro Kawaoka and Peter Halfmann have been studying bird flu for years because of its potential to become a human health concern. As researchers at UW–Madison’s Influenza Research Institute, Kawaoka and Halfmann know a lot about influenza viruses and have the tools to study them safely. Kawaoka and Halfmann have been consulting with Poulsen to determine what it means that there are fragments of inactive virus in the commercial milk supply. Peter Halfmann Halfmann explains that these fragments of virus are simply bits of genetic information, and there is no evidence the milk contains live virus. In fact, generally speaking, most milk likely has fragments of bacterial genetic material that don’t cause reason for concern. Finding the virus fragments in milk is, however, a possible indication of how widespread the disease may be among dairy herds. To understand more about virus inactivation, Kawaoka and Halfmann are studying infected raw milk through a process of heat inactivation similar to pasteurization that they’re recreating in the lab. Having so many researchers at UW–Madison who study various aspects of the dairy industry and the health of herds has proved helpful, as Kawaoka and Halfmann have also teamed up with food science researchers like John Lucey. Lucey helped walk the two through the process of pasteurization so they could understand how to mimic it on a smaller scale in the lab. Once they receive samples of raw milk infected with the virus, Kawaoka and Halfmann’s team can mimic pasteurization by heating up the samples to different temperatures for various amounts of time. From there they can look at how the virus changes throughout the process. This work is ongoing, and Kawaoka and Halfmann hope to be able to share their findings as soon as possible to help expand the scientific understanding of this current strain of bird flu. Pets: Past strains of the bird flu have been known to infect cats. Erin Lashnits, an expert in zoonotic diseases and their impact on pets and owners, says at this point the risk to our furry friends is likely limited to outdoor cats and those with a known exposure to an infected herd or dead birds. Erin Lashnits Clinical signs of infection in cats are nasal discharge, sneezing, coughing, trouble breathing and possible neurological symptoms. However, just because a cat has these signs does not mean they may have avian flu. Regardless, Lashnits says it’s a good idea to seek treatment for a sick cat as it may have something else a vet can treat. “But if you’re a person that has a cat where you know there could be exposure — either you live nearby one of these herds, or you know that there’s been birds that are affected in your area and you’ve seen dead birds around — then being cautious is probably the right answer,” Lashnits says. The risk for dogs and indoor cats is even lower than that of outdoor cats. Concerned owners who see signs of respiratory illness in their pets should contact their vets, but the likelihood of bird flu being the cause of infection is very low. Supply and demand of dairy and poultry products: Andrew Stevens Pasteurized and properly cooked food products remain safe for consumption, but that doesn’t mean there won’t be an impact on the dairy and poultry economy. Andrew Stevens, who studies the effects of agricultural and food policies on consumer food supply and demand, says there are likely two pathways the current virus could impact food availability and prices. “The first pathway is through actual disruptions to supply. The other is through consumer perception of risk,” Stevens says. Infected cows experience lower milk production, and infected flocks often have to be culled, thereby lowering the amount of product available to consumers. The other side of the coin is that even if consumers are assured products are safe, the association with infection may be enough to turn them away from purchasing those products. Stevens is monitoring the virus and its potential effects on consumers and producers moving forward.

While it appears to cause milder infections in cows, H5N1 has also been linked to stunning death rates of 50 per cent or more in other species, including various birds, cats and even humans, though more data and research is needed to fully understand the risks."I think we're way behind the virus," warned Matthew Miller, an immunologist and vaccine developer with McMaster University, who's among the Canadians working on H5N1 research.Without a "robust national surveillance program, there's no way to know if there are infections here or not."The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) told CBC News on Monday it has not detected this form of bird flu yet in dairy cattle — or any other livestock — in Canada. (In birds, however, the disease is already widespread across the country, impacting an estimated 11 million farmed birds to date.)The disease is federally reportable in any species, cattle included, the CFIA said. The agency requires dairy producers to monitor for signs of infection, follow biosecurity measures, and contact their local CFIA office if there is a "high degree of suspicion" of the disease.Avian flu testing will be required for cattle that cross from the U.S. into Canada, among other requirements, said the Canadian Food Inspection Agency. But scientists say Canada needs more proactive surveillance as H5N1 explodes south of the border. (Jeff McIntosh/The Canadian Press)It appears that cross-country trade is still allowed. Asked whether dairy cattle can currently be transported between the U.S. and Canada, the CFIA said the World Organisation of Animal Health "does not recommend restrictions on the movement of healthy cattle and their products at this time."As well, following a U.S. federal order last Wednesday requiring H5N1 testing for many dairy cattle moving between states, "Canada will also require testing for [avian flu] on imported lactating dairy cattle from the U.S.," the CFIA said. When asked about testing milk samples, the agency said if H5N1 is detected in Canadian cattle, it will help provide testing support.(The agency was more clear in an earlier statement on social media, saying it is "not currently testing raw or pasteurized milk," adding that the virus isn't a food safety concern.) Multiple Canadian scientists, however, stress that widespread testing and surveillance efforts should already be underway rather than set to ramp up after a first detection.Canada needs 'active surveillance'Canada should "absolutely be doing active surveillance for H5N1 in cattle," other animals and humans who are in close contact with them, said Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious diseases expert with the University Health Network in Toronto, in correspondence with CBC News.He said those efforts could include a range of approaches such as wastewater surveillance, blood sample studies and nasal swabs.The goal should be going "all-in on prevention," Miller said, adding "pandemics always have the highest risk of happening when we have a virus in animals that humans are heavily exposed to."Given H5N1's unprecedented leap into cattle, followed by explosive cow-to-cow spread across the U.S. in mere weeks, the potential for human-to-human transmission seems more likely as the virus adapts to more mammals, he warned. "If we see more human infections, cat's out of the bag, it's way too late," Miller said. "We need to be sparing no amount of effort, and no amount of expense, in doing absolutely everything to prevent even those initial infections in humans — because the stakes are just too high."The U.S. has reported one human infection linked to the cattle outbreaks so far, in an individual whose only symptom was eye inflammation. However, some scientists have warned there are likely more that aren't being detected, amid growing calls for mass testing on farms.WATCH | Texan contracts bird flu:Human bird flu case linked to U.S. dairy cattle outbreaks7 months agoDuration 2:32A person in Texas who had close contact with infected dairy cattle has been diagnosed with bird flu. It's the country's second known human case after the virus was discovered circulating among dairy cows across at least four U.S. states for the first time."Since the issue in the [U.S.] seems to be bigger than we thought and was brewing before it was recognized, and since we have a plausible route for exposure here, we should be proactive," said Dr. Scott Weese, a professor at the Ontario Veterinary College and director of the University of Guelph's Centre for Public Health and Zoonoses.At a minimum, he added, that would involve milk surveillance. It may not be particularly sensitive — the milk supply is diluted because it comes from so many farms, Weese said. "But if there are positives, we know we have it and then need to look more aggressively at the farm level."Despite sick cows being pulled from production lines, U.S. Food and Drug Administration officials said its recent nationwide survey of milk sold on store shelves found viral remnants of H5N1 in one in five samples. (More reassuringly, federal tests suggest pasteurization — a heating process meant to neutralize harmful pathogens — does ensure milk is safe to drink.) On Monday, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) also announced there will be testing of ground beef in states with bird flu outbreaks, and recently warned the virus may be passing back and forth between cattle and poultry farms. Outbreak officially spread to 34 herds, 9 statesThe first known cattle infected with H5N1 were reported in late March. Since then, at least 34 herds across nine U.S. states have been impacted, and scientists suspect the outbreak is already far bigger than official figures suggest.Newly released research from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also showed profound impacts on farm cats — with a death rate of around 50 per cent among those fed raw milk products from infected cows. The study raises "new concerns regarding the potential for virus spread within mammal populations," the team continued.WATCH | Quebec poultry industry suffers avian flu outbreaks:Avian flu outbreaks shake Quebec poultry industry1 year agoDuration 2:02A Quebec poultry farmer is taking extra precautions to protect his livelihood and livestock as the province grapples with avian flu outbreaks that have killed almost one million birds in the past year.On Monday, other U.S. researchers shared a preprint — research not yet formally published or peer-reviewed — outlining efforts to monitor influenza A at dozens of wastewater sites this spring.The team tested samples from three plants where spring rises in influenza A were observed, and found a marker for the H5 gene at all three facilities. Those plants were also located in an unnamed state with confirmed H5N1 outbreaks among dairy cattle, and two of the facilities discharged animal waste and milk byproducts into sewers, the researchers noted.It all paints a picture of a fast-spreading outbreak that's impacting new species, appearing in new areas, and is likely past the point of containing, several outside scientists agreed.Funding, support for testing neededHere in Canada, funding and support for veterinarians and farmers to test needs to be clear, stressed Weese."If farmers have to pay for sampling and testing, and don't know what will happen if there's a positive, and have no direct personal gain from it, why would they do it voluntarily?" he questioned. "We need a clear program that supports good testing and supports farms."Toronto-based infectious diseases specialist Dr. Allison McGeer, from Sinai Health System, said she's "personally hoping we are not going to get caught off guard" here in Canada.The CFIA says it has not detected this form of bird flu yet in dairy cattle — or any other livestock — in Canada. (Jeff McIntosh/The Canadian Press)What's reassuring, McGeer added, is that Canada does have robust human testing in place to catch severe flu infections. Typically, she says, Canadian hospitals use combined viral testing — for COVID, influenza and RSV — which can pick up a certain protein that is stable across all strains of influenza A.If a human infection of avian flu showed up in a hospital, the test would label it along the lines of "influenza A, subtype not detected," she explained. And, if the patient had also been in contact with poultry or wildlife, that combination of factors could trigger extra lab work to pinpoint the specific type of influenza — including H5N1.Second OpinionWhy dangerous bird flu is spreading faster and farther than first thought in U.S. cattlePasteurized milk includes remnants of H5N1 bird flu, U.S. officials sayLISTENCould H5N1 become the next pandemic?But that's only if someone is sick enough to visit a healthcare facility.

(Photo: Nujaree Rakrun) Nakhon Si Thammarat: An outbreak of influenza at Nakhon Si Thammarat prison has infected almost 3,500 inmates and resulted in two deaths, according to public health officials.The outbreak was confirmed by Dr Kittisak Aksornwong, deputy permanent secretary for public health, who took a team of officials to inspect the situation and investigate the outbreak at the facility in Phra Phom district. According to Dr Kittisak, 3,442 inmates out of 4,427 were found to be infected with a Type-A strain of influenza from April 19-28, and two of them who had underlying diseases died. None of them tested positive for Covid-19. Most of the infected inmates have minor or mild symptoms and they have been given anti-viral medicines for treatment. Vulnerable groups have been separated and are being closely monitored. Dr Pongpoj Thiranantachai, director of Maharat Nakhon Si Thammarat Hospital, said on Wednesday that 25 inmates had been admitted, with five of them requiring intubation. All have high fevers, low oxygen counts, and other symptoms that require medical attention. He said tests confirmed all had contracted the Type A strain of influenza. Dr Pongpoj said the infected inmates have been separated into three groups -- green, yellow and red based on the severity of their symptoms. "The spread of the virus was caused by group activities, and it spread to every prison zone. The health measures taken are similar to those taken during the Covid-19 pandemic. The situation is improving as those infected have responded well to the medicine," he said. No visits are allowed at the prison to prevent virus transmission, and the inmates' families can register for video calls. Eight inmates were admitted to Maharat Nakhon Si Thammarat Hospital on Tuesday night. Meanwhile, the government is urging seven vulnerable groups to get an influenza shot ahead of the rainy season, with free jabs available at public hospitals from May through to August. Vulnerable groups are pregnant women, children aged between six months to two years, people aged 65 and over, and people weighing more than 100kg or with a BMI of 35 and over. Dr Thongchai Kiratihatthayakorn, director-general of the Department of Disease Control (DDC), said a total of 4.51 million influenza vaccine doses will be provided to the public. The number of influenza infections is expected to increase in June, with the peak period between August and November. The vaccine can reduce the severity of symptoms, hospitalisation and death. Some 123,739 people were infected with influenza from Jan 1 to April 29, with five deaths. KEYWORDS Influenza Flu Cold Jail Prison Nakhon Si Thammarat Do you like the content of this article?

How likely is that worst-case scenario?For several decades, scientists have rung alarms that a dangerous form of bird flu had pandemic potential. As H5N1 spreads to more species, including U.S. dairy cattle, how likely is that worst-case scenario?Unprecedented scale of outbreaks raises new concerns, scientists warnLauren Pelley · CBC News · Posted: May 04, 2024 4:00 AM EDT | Last Updated: May 4Without swift intervention and active surveillance, the possibility of the H5N1 virus infecting more humans — and gaining the last few fearsome adaptations allowing its onward spread — could start to rise dramatically, multiple scientists warn. (NIAID/Flickr)Social SharingThis story is part of CBC Health's Second Opinion, a weekly analysis of health and medical science news emailed to subscribers on Saturday mornings. If you haven't subscribed yet, you can do that by clicking here.As early as 1997, just a year after H5N1 was first discovered, there were warning signs this form of avian flu was capable of wreaking havoc far beyond birds.That year, poultry outbreaks in China and Hong Kong were linked to 18 human infections — and a third of those people later died. In the decades that followed, alarm bells from the scientific community rang louder and louder. H5N1 began infecting dozens more species, from tens of millions of wild and farmed birds, to raccoons and foxes, to seals and sea lions to, most recently, U.S. dairy cattle. The virus eventually caused more than 800 human infections around the world with a stunning death rate — for known cases — of roughly 50 per cent."The increasing host range of the virus, [its] potential spread among mammals and between a mammal and a human, its wide geographical spread, and the unprecedented scale of the outbreaks in birds, raise concerns about the pandemic potential" of H5N1, warned a May editorial in leading medical journal The Lancet Infectious Diseases.Given those factors, an avian flu pandemic may feel not just inevitable, but imminent. Chickens are seen on a farm in the Georgian village of Mukhrani in February 2006, amid an outbreak of H5N1 in wild swans on the country's Black Sea coast. (David Mdzinarishvili/Reuters)Yet the reality is murkier. Though influenza viruses have a knack for rapid evolution, this one hasn't managed to adapt to sustain human-to-human transmission, despite circulating for the last three decades."But that could still potentially happen," said epidemiologist Timothy Sly, a longtime influenza researcher and professor emeritus with Toronto Metropolitan University's school of public health."And if it ever did happen… it would be a global health catastrophe."'Are we watching the beginning?'So how likely is that kind of worst-case scenario? And if H5N1 does start spreading person to person — in a month, or a year, or a decade — what would its impacts really be?CBC News talked to several researchers, including those studying H5N1 now and others who've followed influenza trends for decades, to help unpack the crucial unanswered questions around this virus's capacity for sparking a possible pandemic."Are we watching the beginning? Is this where we're seeing repeated spillovers that one day take off? Or is it like in COVID, where suddenly there's a cluster of human cases and then it's too late?" questioned Louise Moncla, an avian flu researcher and assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania.A dead gannet in Point Lance, N.L., during an outbreak of avian influenza. (Patrick Butler/Radio-Canada)There's no way to know, she says. That's why scientists like Moncla are watching the virus closely to understand its transmission patterns and ongoing evolution, all to spot early signals that a storm may be brewing. The spread of H5N1 among U.S. dairy cattle in recent months, and data trickling out from the department of agriculture, offered a treasure trove of genetic sequencing for scientists to sort through. Several research teams, Moncla's included, recently reached similar conclusions: The virus likely spilled from birds into cows as far back as late 2023, and spread undetected among cattle for months before the first cases were reported this March.Moncla's ongoing analysis of the sequences released to date also outlines how the currently circulating form of H5N1 — a lineage known as 2.3.4.4b — features some concerning mutations."There's no smoking guns," she quickly said. "There are some mutations that have occurred that may enhance replication in mammals, but some of the mutations that we would be really worried about, we're not seeing."LISTEN | The next pandemic? The Current19:35Could H5N1 become the next pandemic? Those include adaptations that would allow this virus to better bind to human-specific receptors in the upper airway, which would give it the ability to transmit easily between people. Without that kind of notable shift, H5N1 infections in humans usually end up hitting dead ends.Take the recent instance of a worker infected in Texas. An overview of the case, published Friday in The New England Journal of Medicine, outlined how the worker was in close contact with sick dairy cattle, and developed eye inflammation and broken blood vessels as a result. The virus identified in the worker's specimen also had a previously seen genetic change that's associated with viral adaptation to mammalian hosts.But the individual didn't develop any respiratory symptoms — nor did any household contacts fall ill.So what would it take for onward transmission to occur? Very little, evolutionarily speaking."Influenza is a virus that does mutate fairly easily," said Dr. Jennifer Guthrie, an associate professor with Western University in London, Ont., who specializes in pathogen genomics and infectious diseases. "The longer things circulate, there is always the possibility the situation could change."Government workers burn the remains of chickens, amid efforts to contain an outbreak of bird flu, in the village of Modeste, Ivory Coast, in August 2015. (Luc Gnago/Reuters)Scientists trying to confirm human casesDespite those concerns, what's particularly muddy right now is how a rising number of cattle infections are impacting farm workers, beyond the Texas case that occurred back in March.Veterinarians and physicians in states with dairy cattle outbreaks told The Associated Press there are multiple reports of farm workers falling sick, but confirming cases is proving challenging for one key reason: Many workers are reluctant to get tested."You have groups of individuals that don't have close contact with health care for various reasons," said Guthrie. "Maybe they're vulnerable populations like migrants, or language is a barrier."State health labs have also sent around 25 human test samples to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) so far, and another 100 or so workers are being monitored. The risk of going from a few sporadic cases to "something of international concern" is "not insignificant," CDC principal deputy director Nirav Shah said Wednesday, Politico reported. "We've all seen how a virus can spread around the globe before public health has even had a chance to get its shoes on. That's a risk and one that we have to be mindful of."WATCH | 2 known human cases:Human bird flu case linked to U.S. dairy cattle outbreaks7 months agoDuration 2:32A person in Texas who had close contact with infected dairy cattle has been diagnosed with bird flu. It's the country's second known human case after the virus was discovered circulating among dairy cows across at least four U.S. states for the first time.Moncla also says the risks are real, but questions whether government data is being shared fast enough — and fully enough — to help scientists unpack what's at stake. It's not clear exactly how many people will be tested going forward, or how proactive officials are being to find potential new cases or clusters, she warns. The full tally and severity of human infections could provide added insight, revealing whether there are high numbers of infected people with mild or no symptoms, or if there's still a major evolutionary barrier — like scientists hope — that's keeping this virus from striking humans on a regular basis.There are also burning questions, Moncla says, about how exposure pathways play a role. How different are these infections when someone, say, inhales large amounts of virus while slaughtering an infected chicken, compared to someone who gets sick after milking a cow? And what are the links to symptoms, from mild eye inflammation all the way to deadly respiratory illness?"Filling in that missing gap is pretty important," Moncla said.Health-care workers wheel the bodies of deceased people from the Wyckoff Heights Medical Center during the COVID-19 pandemic, in New York City on April 4, 2020 (Andrew Kelly/Reuters)Death rate remains hazySly, in Toronto, also stresses the need to understand H5N1's potential impacts, should it ever begin spreading person to person. In particular, determining its true death rate is a question the epidemiologist has been trying to answer since the early 2000s. By that point, the World Health Organization had estimated that the case fatality rate for avian flu in humans was roughly 60 per cent. If such a death rate were to be sustained in a pandemic, Sly and other scientists wrote in a 2008 paper, H5N1 would represent a "truly dreadful scenario."But the team's own analysis of surveillance data, along with blood test studies to determine prior exposure to the virus, concluded the virus's case fatality rate in humans was likely closer to 14 to 33 per cent. Far more human infections have been reported since then, including those that may be flying under the radar, suggesting the true death rate could be even lower still."Globally at least, we're probably not catching many cases, so the denominator is, I suspect, an underestimate to some degree," said Guthrie. "Someone having something really, really mild probably wouldn't even know they have influenza."Even so, Sly warns the impact of a new flu virus sweeping through the population would grind society to a halt, causing high levels of death and illness.The case fatality rates of prior influenza pandemics have ranged from less than one per cent, during the 1957 and 1968 pandemics, to an estimated 2.5 per cent in 1918, which studies suggest may have killed anywhere from 23 to 50 million people around the world in just a few years. Scientists warn Canada 'way behind the virus' as bird flu explodes among U.S. dairy cattleSecond OpinionWhy dangerous bird flu is spreading faster and farther than first thought in U.S. cattleThe COVID-19 pandemic, caused by a coronavirus rather than influenza, had a case fatality rate of up to 8.5 per cent in early 2020, according to one analysis, which later dropped to 0.27 per cent by late 2022. (The shift was, in part, due to missed early cases that were mild or asymptomatic, skewing the rate, along with high numbers of deaths early on among older adults being exposed to the virus for the first time.)Another early influence was that in the beginning, it was the elderly who were most exposed and this had the effect of making the CFR appear higher than when the whole population was considered.If H5N1's human death rate was any higher than those, Sly said, "that's getting up there to absolutely catastrophic or disastrous terms."The problem, he says, is we simply don't know exactly what's going to happen "if this thing spreads into humans."Calls for enhanced surveillance, testingWithout swift intervention and active surveillance, the possibility of H5N1 infecting more humans — and gaining those fearsome adaptations allowing its onward spread — could start to rise dramatically, multiple scientists warn.In a report published in early April, European health authorities outlined various necessary measures, including enhancing surveillance and data sharing, careful planning of poultry and fur animal farming, and preventive strategies such as the vaccination of poultry and at-risk people.On Friday, federal officials said Canada is planning to expand its surveillance for avian flu amid the growing outbreak of H5N1 in U.S. dairy cattle, with monitoring efforts now set to include testing of milk being sold on store shelves.But there's concern in both the U.S. and Canada that actual government efforts aren't going far enough.Person diagnosed with bird flu in Texas after contact with cowsPasteurized milk includes remnants of H5N1 bird flu, U.S. officials say52 commercial and backyard flocks in B.C. have been infected with bird flu"People working with cattle should have blood testing done, on a regular basis, to see if it's popping up among that group," said Sly. "Canada assumes the 49th parallel is a barrier against viruses, and it's not."He says countries can't afford to look the other way, given the possibility of this virus eventually making its last few evolutionary leaps."It doesn't seem possible," Sly said, "until suddenly it is possible."ABOUT THE AUTHORLauren PelleySenior Health & Medical ReporterLauren Pelley covers the global spread of infectious diseases, pandemic preparedness and the crucial intersection between health and climate change.

PDF FILE Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza A (H5N1), commonly known as bird flu, has been a significant concern for the poultry industry worldwide. In the United States, recent outbreaks have led to substantial losses in poultry populations. Let’s delve into the details of the situation. With 8.8 million birds affected, April was the month with the highest number of losses caused by H5N1 Avian Influenza in the United States so far this year, accumulating commercial and backyard outbreaks in four states. So far this year, poultry losses total more than 11 million birds, with Michigan being the most affected state with a share of 6.6 million specimens, all of them of a productive nature. Overview: Widespread in wild birds: H5N1 bird flu is prevalent among wild birds globally. These avian carriers play a crucial role in transmitting the virus to domestic poultry. Outbreaks in poultry: The U.S. poultry industry has faced outbreaks of H5N1 in both commercial and backyard flocks. These outbreaks have resulted in significant economic losses. Human case: In April 2024, a farm worker in the United States was infected with HPAI A (H5N1) virus. The exposure was attributed to presumptively infected dairy cattle. This case highlights the zoonotic potential of the virus. No human-to-human transmission: Fortunately, no confirmed cases of human-to-human transmission of H5N1 have been reported. Most human cases are associated with direct exposure to infected birds or poultry. Risk Assessment: Low risk to public health: Despite the outbreaks, the overall risk to the U.S. general public remains low. HPAI A (H5N1) viruses do not easily bind to receptors in the human upper respiratory tract, reducing the likelihood of widespread human infections. Ongoing surveillance: Comprehensive surveillance of H5N1 viruses in wild birds, poultry, mammals, and humans is essential. Preparedness efforts are crucial to monitor and assess the public health risk. CDC’s Efforts: Monitoring and preparedness: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) actively monitors clade 2.3.4.4b HPAI A (H5N1) viruses in wild birds, poultry, and other animals. They collaborate with state and local health partners to track potential exposures. Transmissibility concerns: CDC prepares for the possibility that contemporary H5N1 viruses may gain increased transmissibility among humans. Vigilance is necessary to prevent any potential pandemic. The battle against avian influenza continues, with ongoing surveillance, preparedness efforts, and collaboration between health agencies and the poultry industry. As we navigate the challenges posed by H5N1, it is crucial to prioritize the health of both birds and humans. By staying informed and implementing preventive measures, we can mitigate the impact of avian influenza on our poultry industry and protect public health. In summary, while the U.S. poultry industry faces challenges due to H5N1 outbreaks, the risk to human health remains low. Continued surveillance and preparedness efforts are vital to mitigate the impact of this avian influenza strain.Continue after advertising. Sources: Available upon request.
