Situation Update October 11, 2024 – CDC continues to respond to the public health challenge posed by a multistate outbreak of avian influenza A(H5N1) virus, or "H5N1 bird flu," in dairy cows, poultry and other animals in the United States. CDC is working in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR), state public health and animal health officials, and other partners using a One Health approach. Since April 2024, 20 human cases of avian influenza A(H5) virus infection have been reported in the United States; 21 in total since 2022. Ten of these cases were associated with exposure to H5N1 bird flu-infected poultry and nine were associated with exposure to sick or infected dairy cows 12. This includes six cases in California, two of which were confirmed by CDC on Thursday, October 3, two on Wednesday, October 9, and two on Thursday, October 10. All California cases occurred in dairy workers on affected farms. All of the California cases are from different farms, except for one case reported this week, which was from a farm that had a case reported previously. The two cases from the same affected farm worked on different parts of the farm and are not close contacts of each other. The epidemiology of the situation continues to suggest sporadic instances of animal-to-human spread. All six California cases are reported to have experienced mild symptoms, including eye redness or discharge (conjunctivitis), and none were hospitalized. Additional testing is ongoing in California, and presumptive positives are being routinely forwarded to CDC for confirmatory testing. Going forward, CDC will track and report confirmed cases, by state and source of exposure, in a table on its website. The source of the exposure in one case, which was reported by Missouri on September 6, could not be determined. Serological tests of the contacts of the Missouri case are pending. CDC believes the immediate risk to the general public from H5N1 bird flu remains low, but people with exposure to infected animals are at higher risk of infection. On the animal health side, USDA is reporting that 299 dairy herds in 14 U.S. states have confirmed cases of H5 bird flu virus infections in dairy cows. The number of affected herds continues to grow nationally, fueled by increases in California. Last week, USDA reported 56 affected dairy herds in California as of October 3. That number increased to 100 by October 11. USDA reports that since April 2024, there have been H5 detections in 36 commercial flocks and 26 backyard flocks, for a total of 18.75 million birds affected. Among other activities previously reported in past spotlights and ongoing, recent highlights of CDC's response to this include: Laboratory Update CDC has performed genetic sequencing on samples from the two human cases of H5 bird flu in California confirmed on Thursday, October 3, and one of two human cases in California confirmed on Wednesday, October 9. Efforts to sequence additional cases are in progress. The results confirm that all three viruses sequenced to date are clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 viruses, closely related to those detected in dairy cattle. The whole genome was sequenced from one of the first two cases (A/California/135/2024) and was confirmed to be a B3.13 genotype virus. CDC has publicly posted in GISAID and submitted to GenBank the HA, NA, and NS gene segments for A/California/134/2024 (GISAID EPI_ISL_19463619; NCBI_PQ435213- PQ435215) and the whole genome sequence for A/California/135/2024 (GISAID EPI_ISL_19463618; NCBI_PQ435216-PQ435223). Additional sequencing data will be posted as it becomes available. While the hemagglutinins (HAs) of the three sequenced viruses contained new amino acid changes compared to closely-related candidate vaccine viruses (CVVs) – two in A/California/135/2024, three in A/California/134/2024, and three in A/California/146/2024 – none contained changes associated with increased infectivity or transmissibility among humans. CDC identified no changes associated with reduced susceptibility to neuraminidase inhibitors or polymerase acidic inhibitors, nor were there any changes associated with mammalian adaptation in other gene segments in samples from any of the cases based on currently available sequence data. CDC successfully isolated virus from samples from the first two confirmed cases in California. Attempts to isolate virus from subsequent specimens are pending. Antigenic characterization and antiviral susceptibility testing of the two viruses that have been isolated to date are underway. Antigenic characterization will inform whether existing H5 bird flu CVVs are still well-matched to these viruses. CDC also has completed development and quality control testing of a reverse genetics-generated virus with the HA mutations (HA P136S and A156T) identified in the virus isolated from the H5N1 bird flu case in Missouri reported on September 6, 2024. Initial testing showed that the virus had reduced cross-reactivity to ferret antisera raised to viruses without these changes. To ensure optimal match with the Missouri H5N1 bird flu virus, this reverse genetics-generated virus will be used for serology testing of serum samples from the confirmed case in Missouri and close contacts. Seasonal Flu Vaccination Initiative CDC has allocated more than 100,000 doses of seasonal influenza vaccine to 12 states with dairy herds that have tested positive for H5 bird flu. This is part of a CDC initiative announced this summer to provide a number of supplemental free seasonal influenza vaccines to farm workers across states affected by H5 to prevent the spread of seasonal flu in these communities and safeguard public health. The 12 participating states include: California, Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, South Dakota, and Texas. All states with dairy herds that have tested positive for H5 bird flu were invited to apply to receive additional doses of seasonal influenza vaccine – allocated specifically for farm workers – beyond what the states were already planning to provide. States will conduct screening to ensure these doses are going to farm workers and will track the number of doses given monthly by age. CDC also has awarded approximately $2 million in funding to support the operational costs of the various activities jurisdictions are implementing to encourage and facilitate the uptake of seasonal flu vaccination among farm workers. Examples include the use of mobile vaccine clinics, promotion via virtual town halls and vaccine education workshops, and partnering with local public health agencies and community-based organizations to organize mass vaccination events. While a seasonal flu vaccine does not protect against H5 bird flu, expanding access to seasonal flu vaccines among farm workers can prevent severe illness and help reduce the strain of the flu season on rural health care systems. Reducing the prevalence of seasonal flu also can help public health agencies better detect cases of H5 bird flu, should they occur. And fewer people infected with seasonal flu means fewer opportunities for the very rare possibility of co-infection with both a human seasonal virus and an avian virus. Surveillance Update As part of CDC's Farmworker Enhanced Surveillance Program (FWESP), CDC is working with pharmacy networks eTrueNorth and Walgreens on a pilot program to provide free testing of symptomatic persons in California and one other state initially that have confirmed H5N1 bird flu infections in people, poultry, or livestock. The program aims to increase testing for seasonal flu and triage for H5 testing if needed, raise awareness about the symptoms and risk factors for infection with H5N1 bird flu among higher-risk populations, and determine whether certain rapid point-of-care (POC) tests identify influenza A-positive specimens when farm or dairy workers are infected with H5N1 bird flu. CDC continues to support states that are monitoring people with exposure to cows, birds, or other domestic or wild animals infected, or potentially infected, with H5N1 bird flu. To date, more than 5,000 people have been monitored as a result of their exposure to infected or potentially infected animals, and at least 240 people who have developed flu-like symptoms have been tested as part of this targeted, situation-specific testing. Testing of exposed people who develop symptoms is happening at the state or local level, and CDC conducts confirmatory testing. Since February 25, 2024, more than 53,000 specimens have been tested at public health labs that would have detected avian influenza A(H5) or other novel influenza viruses. One of the specimens tested at a public health laboratory as a part of routine surveillance was identified as presumptive A(H5) positive and was confirmed as H5N1 positive by CDC. More information on monitoring can be found at Symptom Monitoring Among Persons Exposed to HPAI. CDC also continues to monitor flu surveillance data using CDC's 2024-2025 influenza surveillance strategy, especially in areas where H5N1 bird flu viruses have been detected in dairy cows or other animals, for any unusual trends, including in flu-like illness, conjunctivitis, or influenza virus activity. Overall, for the most recent week of data, CDC flu surveillance systems show no indicators of unusual flu activity in people, including H5N1 bird flu viruses. Outreach CDC continues to support outreach to farm workers around the topic of H5N1 bird flu. This includes targeted outreach to farm workers in affected counties through Meta (Facebook and Instagram) and digital display and audio (Pandora). CDC also is running advertisements on local radio stations about 30 times each week to reach people who may not be on social media platforms. These resources provide information in English and Spanish about potential risks of H5N1 bird flu infection, recommended preventive actions, symptoms to be on the lookout for, and what to do if people develop symptoms. Outreach metrics are summarized in Table 1 (below). CDC also is developing an outreach strategy to raise awareness about the free seasonal flu vaccinations being offered to farm workers in affected states this season. CDC Recommendations As a reminder, CDC recommends that: People should avoid exposures to sick or dead animals, including wild birds, poultry, other domesticated birds, and other wild or domesticated animals (including cows), if possible. People should also avoid exposures to animal poop, bedding (litter), unpasteurized ("raw") milk, or materials that have been touched by, or close to, birds or other animals with suspected or confirmed avian influenza A(H5N1) virus, if possible. People should not drink raw milk. Pasteurization kills avian influenza A(H5N1) viruses, and pasteurized milk is safe to drink. People who have job-related contact with infected or potentially infected birds or other animals should be aware of the risk of exposure to avian influenza viruses and should take proper precautions. People should wear appropriate and recommended personal protective equipment when exposed to an infected or potentially infected animal(s). CDC has recommendations for worker protection and use of personal protective equipment (PPE). CDC has interim recommendations for prevention, monitoring, and public health investigations of avian influenza A(H5N1) virus infections in people. Following these recommendations is central to reducing a person's risk and containing the overall public health risk. In addition to limiting interactions between infected animals and people, containing the outbreak among animals also is important, which underscores the urgency of the work being done by USDA and animal health and industry partners. This is an evolving situation, and CDC is committed to providing frequent and timely updates. Table 1.

It was also likely the first human infection with avian influenza A(H5N1) virus from a cow globally. A second human case associated with the dairy cow outbreak was identified in Michigan on May 22, 2024, followed by a third case in Michigan on May 30, 2024. The fourth human case was identified in Colorado on July 3, 2024. None of these cases are associated with the others. Cumulatively, there have been 14 human cases of H5 bird flu reported in the United States. On July 14, 2024, CDC confirmed four human cases of H5 bird flu in Colorado, and additional (fifth and sixth) cases in Colorado were confirmed at CDC and were reported on July 19, 2024. Three additional cases in Colorado from a different farm were confirmed by CDC on July 25, 2024. Nine of these 14 cumulative human cases of H5 bird flu in the United States have been confirmed as avian influenza A(H5N1). The first human case of H5N1 bird flu in the United States was reported on April 28, 2022, in a person in Colorado who had direct exposure to poultry and who was involved in depopulating poultry with presumptive H5N1 bird flu. The 2022 human case was not related to dairy cows. The person only reported fatigue without any other symptoms and recovered.

Delivering multiple antigens individually, however, complicates manufacturing and increases cost, thus it would be beneficial to express both proteins from a single mRNA. Here, we develop an mRNA genetic configuration that allows the simultaneous expression of unmodified, full-length NA and HA proteins from a single open reading frame. We apply this approach to glycoproteins from contemporary influenza A and B viruses and, after vaccination, observe high levels of functional antibodies and protection from disease in female mouse and male ferret challenge models. This approach may further efforts to utilize mRNA technology to improve seasonal vaccine efficacy by efficiently delivering multiple viral antigens simultaneously and in their native state.

In the 2022–23 season, it was estimated there were over 30 million cases in the United States alone, and worldwide there can be between 250,000 and 500,000 deaths from influenza illness in a given season1,2. Seasonal influenza viruses also contribute to a significant economic burden of an estimated $25 billion USD in a typical flu season3. One of the main tools in battling seasonal influenza burden are vaccines. These vaccines typically induce a highly focused response to antigenic domains of the viral hemagglutinin (HA) and to a lesser extent, the viral neuraminidase (NA)4,5,6. The HA-directed antibodies elicited typically block host receptor engagement and thus, mediate virus neutralization7,8,9. The strong effect of these antibodies, however, places a significant selective pressure on antigenic sites in the head domain of HA, leading to rapid viral antigenic drift10,11,12. These changes necessitate seasonal influenza vaccine reformulation every year to target three or four virus strains that are expected to be circulating, typically an H1N1 and an H3N2 Influenza A virus (IAV) and a Victoria-lineage and a Yamagata-lineage Influenza B virus (IBV).While subunit, recombinant protein, and live-attenuated FDA-approved influenza vaccines exist, the most widely administered seasonal influenza vaccines consist of influenza viral particles that are grown to scale in eggs then inactivated with detergents13. This process ‘splits’ the viral particles and subsequently exposes the immune system to multiple antigenic viral proteins, such as NA and HA, upon vaccination. Split inactivated vaccines are normalized only on HA content, leaving the amount and integrity of the other major glycoprotein, NA, uncertain. Indeed, it has been shown that NA-specific human antibodies poorly recognize NA within split inactivated vaccines and the NA-directed vaccine responses themselves can be highly variable14,15. Additionally, relatively long manufacturing pipelines necessitate 6–8 months between strain selection and vaccine administration, allowing time for mutations to arise in circulating strains that change the antigenicity relative to vaccine strains16. Egg-adapted mutations acquired by vaccine strains during production can also significantly alter antigenicity. These issues can lead to extreme examples where the vaccines end up being ineffective against certain subtypes of influenza viruses, shown recently in the 2014–15, 2016–17 and 2017–18 influenza seasons13,16,17,18,19,20,21. Even under more normal conditions, seasonal influenza vaccines still elicit only ~20–60% vaccine efficacy22. mRNA-based vaccines may represent a practical path to improved influenza vaccines. These vaccines consist of mRNA transcripts that encode for a particular antigen, encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). They can mediate extremely high vaccine efficacy rates (>90% for COVID-19) through induction of both robust humoral and cellular immunity23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30. Since they do not produce infectious viruses, these vaccines are considered safe to administer in immunocompromised and elderly individuals as well as children31,32,33. To make mRNA-LNPs, researchers only require the sequence of the intended antigen and then corresponding oligonucleotides can be synthesized without heavy reliance on external production factors such as egg availability. This relatively simple production process allows for more rapid updates in the event of viral mutations or changes in circulating strain prevalence34. The question of what influenza virus antigen(s) mRNA vaccine formulations should include to maximize vaccine-mediated protection, however, remains an open area of debate.While the inclusion of an HA protein as an antigen is a forgone conclusion as vaccination with HA is essential for generating neutralizing antibodies, the inclusion of neuraminidase in the vaccine may also be beneficial as NA-directed responses have been shown to boost the breadth of protectivity and limit disease14,15,35. NA-directed antibodies have been shown to be important controllers of infection that limit disease in animal models5,36,37. Additionally, NA is a more conserved viral protein that accumulates slower antigenic drift than HA, therefore broadly reactive NA antibodies have been shown to confer cross-reaction protection both within and across NA subtypes38,39,40,41,42. Thus, it may be that the simultaneous delivery of multiple viral glycoproteins (as per natural infection), could allow for maximal vaccine-induced protection. Indeed, vaccination with non-HA or multiple influenza antigens via mRNA-LNPs is currently being investigated by numerous groups and companies43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51. For mRNA approaches delivering multiple antigens, viral proteins are often encoded in separate mRNA-LNPs, which are then mixed prior to vaccination. This method of vaccine production and delivery, while at least partially effective in eliciting antibody responses, is more complex, costly, and cannot control which transfected cells express which glycoprotein and fails to control the relative expression of viral proteins in cells that express both. This lack of coordinated co-expression of the glycoproteins ultimately fails to reconstitute the biological landscape of an infected cell and limits meaningful biological interactions between NA and HA52,53,54,55. While expressing multiple antigens from a single mRNA could potentially solve many of the problems of co-delivery of multiple antigens, a technical solution for our goal of creating such an mRNA vaccine, and one that would also more closely recapitulate an infected cell, remained unclear.In this work, we develop an mRNA vaccine platform that delivers NA and HA as a single open reading frame (ORF) to enable expression of multiple unmodified antigens from a single mRNA, using a unique glycoprotein organization with an artificial furin cleavage site and 2A ribosome-skipping sequences. We find that this design is able to induce robust immune responses to both antigens and at levels consistent with vaccination of mRNA-LNPs encoding either viral protein alone. Furthermore, we show that this technology can be used to deliver the NA and HA of four different influenza viruses as a quadrivalent mRNA vaccine that delivers eight distinct antigens while only using four mRNA encapsulated in individual LNPs. In a single dose, this quadrivalent mRNA vaccine is effective and in some cases superior to a current inactivated industry standard vaccine comparator in immunogenicity for all vaccine strains in both mouse and ferret models. We find that our vaccine induces antibodies targeting not only the conserved stalk region of vaccine strain HAs, but also to antigenically diverse group 1 and 2 HAs, suggesting broader immunity against diverse influenza virus strains. Together, these data present the strategy suggested here as an effective and efficient way to improve current seasonal as well as broadly protective influenza vaccine strategies.ResultsNA and HA can be efficiently expressed from a single ORFOur goal was to express completely native HA and NA glycoproteins from a single mRNA. While viral 2A sites have been widely utilized to facilitate expression of multiple individual proteins from the same transcript, they leave residual amino acids on the termini of the separated proteins56,57. It is known that some furin cleavage sequences (such as RKRR) preceeding a porcine teschovirus 2A (PTV-2A) site allow the furin protease to remove most of the residual PTV-2A amino acids, and carboxypeptidases can then eliminate the residual furin cleavage motif58. We previously demonstrated that we could adapt this approach to influenza viral glycoproteins in the context of an infectious virus by encoding NA followed by HA59. We therefore hypothesized that a similar approach could be used to generate unmodified NA and HA proteins in the context of an mRNA vaccine (Fig. 1a). To test this hypothesis, we first designed DNA plasmids that encoded for either the expression of NA, HA, or both proteins through the NA-F2A-HA construct using viral sequences from the contemporary H3N2 virus, A/Tasmania/503/2020, which was a component of the 2021–22 seasonal influenza vaccine. After validating that we had the proper tools to detect the A/Tasmania/503/2020 viral proteins (Supplementary Fig. 1A–D), we used cell-based ELISAs and microscopy to demonstrate that NA and HA were expressed from cells transfected with the NA-F2A-HA plasmid to similar levels as those transfected with plasmids encoding either antigen alone or as a mixture (Fig. 1b–e). Similarly, confocal microscopy revealed proper expression and trafficking of each of these proteins to the surface of cells transfected with our NA-F2A-HA plasmid (Fig. 1f). We also wanted to confirm that the NA and HA expressed from our NA-F2A-HA plasmid were functional. NA expressed from our NA-F2A-HA construct was found to mediate sialic acid removal in a lectin-based activity assay to the same degree as NA individually expressed from a plasmid or in combination with an HA-expressing plasmid (Fig. 1g). Similarily, HA expressed from the NA-F2A-HA plasmid was found to mediate similar membrane fusion activity as HA individually expressed from a plasmid or in combination with an NA-expressing plasmid under low pH conditions (Fig. 1h). These results suggested that indeed, the NA-F2A-HA design could be applied to vaccine design to express two functional, native viral proteins from a single ORF.Fig. 1: NA and HA can be properly expressed from a single DNA construct by separation via furin cleavage sites and PTV-2A motif.a Diagram of NA-F2A-HA expression vector.

Therefore, we generated mRNA-LNPs that encoded for either the NA, HA, or the NA-F2A-HA proteins. The LNP carriers themselves have been shown to act as strong adjuvants, therefore no additional adjuvants were included60. These mRNA-LNPs were delivered to mice, as well as control groups that included an mRNA-LNP encoding luciferase, a group where the individual HA and NA mRNA-LNPs were mixed prior to vaccination, as well as the 2021–22 split inactivated Flulaval vaccine and a matched bovine serum albumin (BSA) control (Fig. 2a). For the mRNA vaccines, equal moles of RNA were delivered, and the dose given was scaled to 1/6 of a human dose for both the mRNA-LNPs and Flulaval vaccine. Post-vaccination sera revealed that the mRNA-LNP vaccines that encoded for NA or HA (as well as the Flulaval control) elicited robust antibody responses against the targeted A/Tasmania/503/2020 protein (Fig. 2b–e). Importantly, mice vaccinated with the NA-F2A-HA mRNA-LNP vaccine elicited a similar, or in the case of HA, better, antibody response to both viral proteins than mice vaccinated with mRNA-LNPs expressing either antigen alone or when the NA mRNA-LNP and HA mRNA-LNP vaccines were mixed (Fig. 2b–e). Thus, although we didn’t monitor protein expression from this mRNA in vivo, it is likely that both HA and NA were appropriately expressed as per our in vitro DNA-based expression experiments.Fig. 2: Vaccination with an H3N2 NA-F2A-HA mRNA-LNP is as immunogenic against both antigens in mice as mRNA-LNPs encoding either antigen.a Schematic of vaccine groups and vaccination regimen.

Indeed, the HA mRNA-LNPs, NA + HA mixture mRNA-LNPs, NA-F2A-HA mRNA-LNPs, and Flulaval vaccines elicited hemagglutinin-specific neutralizing antibodies (Fig. 2f), and the NA mRNA-LNP, NA + HA mixture mRNA-LNPs, and NA-F2A-HA mRNA-LNP vaccines also elicited antibodies with detectible neuraminidase inhibition activity above the background level of naïve mouse sera (Fig. 2g). We also performed multicycle microneutralization assays (MN50) and plaque-reduction assays (PRNT50). These assays, which principally measure the activity of HA-directed antibody responses, both revealed that the HA mRNA-LNP, NA + HA mixture mRNA-LNPs, and NA-F2A-HA mRNA-LNP vaccines elicited equally higher levels of neutralizing antibodies than other groups (Fig. 2h, i). Notably, each of these assays showed noninferiority of delivering both antigens through our NA-F2A-HA mRNA construct compared to vaccinating with each antigen alone or via a mixture of HA and NA mRNA-LNPs. Finally, we challenged vaccinated mice with a lethal dose of a mouse-adapted antigenically similar H3N2 virus (A/Switzerland/9175293/2013) to assess protection from disease (Fig. 2j). Luciferase mRNA-LNP-, BSA-, and Flulaval-vaccinated controls experienced severe weight loss and generally died by day 8 post-infection, with some protection mediated by Flulaval where 3/5 vaccinated mice were able to recover from infection. Mice vaccinated with NA mRNA-LNPs, HA mRNA-LNPs, NA + HA mixture mRNA-LNPs, and NA-F2A-HA mRNA-LNPs all survived infection and displayed marked bodyweight loss (Fig. 2k, l). Therefore, the NA-F2A-HA mRNA-LNP vaccine elicited an immune response against both NA and HA similar to that generated following vaccination with mRNA-LNPs encoding for either antigen alone or mixed. Further, vaccination with our NA-F2A-HA mRNA-LNP vaccine is protective against lethal challenge and, at least in this model of disease, provides improved protection relative to current industry standard vaccines.NA-F2A-HA mRNA-LNP vaccines targeting non-H3N2 viral strains are immunogenic in miceWe next wanted to see if we could apply the NA-F2A-HA mRNA design to other strains of influenza A and influenza B viruses. We therefore generated NA-F2A-HA mRNA-LNP vaccines targeting the remaining three strains included in the 2021–22 influenza vaccine: H1N1 A/Victoria/2570/2019, IBV_V B/Washington/02/2019 and IBV_Y B/Phuket/3073/2013. These vaccines were then independently administered to mice as per our previous experiments with the H3N2-based vaccine (Fig. 3a). Analysis of the post-vaccination sera revealed that the NA-F2A-HA mRNA-LNP vaccines encoding for the H1N1 antigens (Fig. 3b–e), the IBV_V antigens (Fig. 3g–j), and IBV_Y antigens (Fig. 3l–o) all elicited significantly higher antibody responses against their respective NAs and HAs compared to luciferase mRNA-LNPs and Flulaval. Further, these antibodies were found to be neutralizing against antigenically matched (in the case of IBV_Y) or with as antigenically similar viruses as we could acquire and culture in the lab, A/Hawaii/70/2019 for the H1N1 and B/Colorado/06/2017 for the IBV_V (Fig. 3f, k, p).Fig. 3: NA-F2A-HA mRNA-LNP design can be applied to additional influenza virus subtypes to induce superior immunogenic responses to Flulaval in mice.a Schematic showing vaccine design of H1N1, IBV-Victoria and IBV-Yamagata NA-F2A-HA mRNA-LNPs.

Mice were vaccinated with a mixture of equal parts of the NA-F2A-HA mRNA-LNP vaccines targeting either the H1N1, H3N2, IBV-Y or IBV-V strains of influenza virus at half the dosage as when they were administered individually (Fig. 4a). This ‘four mRNA-LNP’ vaccine was found to generate strong antibody responses against the NAs and HAs of all four vaccine strains, non-inferiorly to those elicited following Flulaval vaccination (Fig. 4b–e). To test if our vaccine was able to boost pre-existing immunity similar to what would be found in a human population, we performed a study in which pre-immunity was first established via either BSA control or one of two “pre-immune mixes”. “Pre-immune mix 1” consisted of inactivated A/California/04/2009, A/Wyoming/03/2003, B/Malaysia/2506/2004, B/Yamagata/16/1988 viral particles, and “Pre-immune mix 2” was Flulaval. Once these different pre-immune profiles were established (Supplementary Fig. 2A, B), we then vaccinated mice with the four mRNA-LNP vaccine and found that our vaccine was able to successfully boost anti-NA and anti-HA antibody levels in both pre-existing immune backgrounds (Supplementary Fig. 2C–F).Fig. 4: A mixture of four NA-F2A-HA mRNA-LNPs elicits protective immune responses against lethal H1N1, H3N2, and IBV-Yamagata challenges.a Schematic of vaccination and challenge experiment.

FDR-corrected p-values are reported above sample groups. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageTo assess the functional neutralization capability of these antibodies, we performed PRNT50 assays (using the same viruses as in the separate vaccination experiments) and found that the four mRNA-LNP vaccine elicited significantly higher levels of neutralizing H1N1, H3N2, IBV_V and IBV_Y antibodies compared to the luciferase mRNA-LNP controls and generally higher responses than animals that received Flulaval (Fig. 4f–i). Finally, we wanted to determine if the four mRNA-LNP vaccine was protective against lethal challenge. Although we were unable to identify a contemporary IBV_V that caused disease in mice, we challenged the quadrivalent vaccine group (and controls) with a contemporary H1N1 (A/Hawaii/70/2019) (Fig. 4j), H3N2 (A/Switzerland/9175293/2013) virus (Fig. 4k), or matched IBV_Y virus (B/Phuket/3073/2013) (Fig. 4l). All mice vaccinated with the four mRNA-LNP or Flulaval were found to be completely protected against lethal challenge with all three viruses, while luciferase mRNA-LNP-vaccinated mice died between days 7–10 post infection (Fig. 4m–o). We also noted a trend for less bodyweight loss in the four mRNA-LNP-vaccinated group relative to the Flulaval group after the H3N2 and IBV_Y viral challenges.The four NA-F2A-HA mRNA-LNP vaccine mixture elicits protective immunity in ferretsFinally, we wanted to confirm that our four mRNA-LNP vaccine would behave similarly in a ferret model to what we had previously observed in mice. We therefore vaccinated ferrets with either luciferase mRNA-LNP, our four mRNA-LNP vaccine, or Flulaval (Fig. 5a). As expected, animals vaccinated with our four mRNA-LNP vaccine elicited robust antibody responses against all four vaccine strain antigens (Fig. 5b–e), with higher responses relative to Flulaval for H1N1, H3N2, and IBV_Y antigens and similar levels as Flulaval for IBV_V antigens. We also found that our four mRNA-LNP vaccine elicited significantly higher levels of neutralizing antibodies post-vaccination, and similar levels compared to Flulaval-vaccinated animals against all four influenza strains (Fig. 5f–i). We then challenged with the contemporary H1N1 strain, A/Hawaii/66/2019 (98.41% A/Hawaii/70/2019 HA sequence homology to A/Victoria/2570/2019 HA) (Fig. 5a). While ferrets are good models of the human clinical course of disease during influenza virus infection, their susceptibility to contemporary influenza viruses is variable61. As expected, we saw little change in bodyweight over the course of infection between groups (Fig. 5j) but were able to see a modest decrease in viral RNA from four mRNA-LNP-vaccinated animals at days 2, 4, and 7 of infection (Fig. 5k). Importantly, viral titer determined from oral swabs indicated that infection was less likely to be established in our four mRNA-LNP vaccinated ferrets, and if they were infected, they were able to clear the virus more efficiently than luciferase mRNA-LNP- or Flulaval-vaccinated ferrets (Fig. 5l). Thus, despite being a sub-optimal challenge model for this contemporary H1N1 strain, the ferret challenge data is consistent with the antibody analyses showing enhanced vaccine responses in the four mRNA-LNP vaccine group.Fig. 5: A mixture of four NA-F2A-HA mRNA-LNPs elicits a strong immune response to not only vaccine strain NA, HA, and HA stalk, but also diverse group 1 and 2 HAs, and limits disease following H1N1 viral challenge in ferrets.a Schematic of vaccination and challenge experiment.

Using this knowledge, taken in combination with our findings that four mRNA-LNP-vaccinated ferrets had increased antibody binding but similar viral neutralization activities relative to Flulaval-vaccinated ferrets, we wanted to test if our four mRNA-LNP vaccine elicited non-neutralizing antibodies against epitopes other than the HA head. We therefore performed cell-based ELISAs against the stalk domain of the vaccine-matched H1 and H3 HAs using headless, stalk-only HA expression plasmids that were previously validated using conformation-specific antibodies (Supplementary Fig. 3). Interestingly, we found that indeed, our four mRNA-LNP vaccine elicited higher levels of HA stalk-specific antibodies than luciferase mRNA-LNPs or Flulaval in ferrets (Fig. 5m–n). To test if this enhanced antibody response to a more conserved HA domain would allow for increased binding to heterologous HAs, we performed a Luminex-based purified HA binding assay using group 1 and 2 HAs from 1933-2021. Within group 1 HAs (Fig. 5o, left) we found that our four mRNA-LNP vaccine elicited higher magnitude responses compared to Flulaval to both older and contemporary H1s and, to a lesser degree, the H2, H5, H6, and H9 HAs. Within the group 2 HAs (Fig. 5o, right), our vaccine elicited similar antibody responses as Flulaval to older H3 HAs, but significantly higher responses to more contemporary H3 and H7 HAs. These findings suggest that our four mRNA-LNP vaccine elicits not only a strong response against vaccine-matched strains, but also a generally more cross-reactive antibody profile against heterologous viruses.DiscussionWhile inactivated seasonal influenza vaccines elicit protective immunogenicity, their overall efficacy is limited13,16,18,19,20,21,22. Advancements in mRNA-based technologies in the recent years now make this a practical vaccine modality; however, questions remain regarding the antigen composition and the best configurations to express those antigens. In this study, we present a method of improving seasonal influenza vaccination using a dual antigen-expressing mRNA-LNP strategy. Using only four mRNA-LNPs, we can express eight individual NA and HA proteins by separating the glycoprotein ORFs with furin and 2A cleavage motifs. This NA-F2A-HA mRNA design can be broadly applied to influenza A and influenza B viral glycoproteins, and individual mRNA-LNPs can be mixed to recapitulate the breadth of a typical quadrivalent, virion-based, seasonal vaccine. Further, the four mRNA-LNP vaccine was found to elicit fully protective, and in some cases superior, immune responses to the NA and HA of all four vaccine strains compared to the current inactivated industry standard vaccine in both mice and ferrets.In addition to its ability to act as an improved seasonal influenza vaccine, our four mRNA-LNP also demonstrated an ability to induce higher responses to the relatively conserved stalk of the HA protein. This ability was likely responsible for the increased binding we observed after mRNA-LNP vaccination to highly drifted HA variants. Although stalk-specific antibodies are non-neutralizing, they have been shown to confer protection through alternate immune pathways, such as the antibody-dependent cytotoxicity (ADCC) pathway62. While these data are promising, future studies will be needed to demonstrate that this increased binding translates to functional activity. Further work will also be required to define which specific epitopes are being uniquely or disproportionately targeted after mRNA-LNP vaccination. mRNA vaccines have also been shown to induce superior cellular immune responses that are critical in viral control and clearance, i.e., antigen-specific CD8 + T-cell responses64,65,66 and potentially improved mucosal IgA responses. We did not formally measure such responses, however, and future work understanding the full breadth of mechanisms that mediate the protection afforded by our vaccine will be required.Future studies will also be required to understand the relative contributions and mechanisms of NA-mediated immunity after vaccination. Our results, consistent with previous literature42,67,68,69,70, showed that current inactivated vaccines elicit little NA-specific immunity. It is estimated that inactivated vaccines only elicit ~30% seroconversion against NA, and it is suggested this is due to a lack of normalization of NA amounts or NA epitope disruption during vaccine production14,15,42,67,68,69. Thus, while improved HA-directed responses (both in magnitude and breadth) will almost certainly contribute to improved vaccine-mediated protection, the ability of this vaccine to express NA in stochiometric equivalent to HA may also improve protection via elicitation of strong-NA directed responses. Furthermore, it will also be necessary to dissect any potential impacts of expressing NA and HA together through the NA-F2A-HA construct on the immunogenicity of the viral proteins themselves. It has been suggested that for some antigens, removal of sialic acids specifically can increase their antigenicity71. Thus, in addition to simply expressing HA and NA viral proteins simultaneously, the phenomena of NA removing sialic acid from HA-linked glycans52,53 may also modulate antigenicity of the protein itself. Future studies, however, will be required to determine if this is indeed the case.While the vaccine approach described in this study appears promising, there are several limitations that should be considered. Despite the NA-F2A-HA construct design halving the number of mRNAs to be made, our mRNAs are longer than those encoding for a single antigen. This might leave them more vulnerable to human RNAses upon vaccination, leading to more rapid degradation in vivo compared to their smaller counterparts. Therefore, studies on mRNA half-life and the length of antigen expression in vivo, as well as the consequences of any changes, will be necessary future steps. Furthermore, in addition to the NA-F2A-HA mRNA-LNP simplifying the manufacturing process by reducing production time and cost, we initially hypothesized that coordinated expression of HA and NA could affect antigenicity of the proteins. We ultimately did not perform any studies to directly test this hypothesis in this work, but additional studies looking at differences in the antibody composition elicited by different vaccines will be important. Finally, while we attempted to model pre-existing influenza immunity in mice, the immune history of humans is much more complicated and nuanced. For this reason, our vaccine will need to be carefully assessed for its ability to boost immune responses in other pre-existing immunity animal models and ultimately in humans.In conclusion, mRNA vaccines have the potential to eliminate many of the limitations that plague current vaccine platforms. By incorporating multiple antigens into a single formulation, our vaccine offers a promising strategy to improve vaccine effectiveness without increasing manufacturing complexity. Moving forward, application of the advances in mRNA technology such as those that we propose here, will allow for improved influenza vaccines which will ultimately help to mitigate the burden of influenza globally. Outside of influenza vaccines, our approach for delivering multiple antigens at once can potentially be applied to other fields of mRNA delivery research, such as for cancer, rare genetic disorder therapies, and other infectious diseases.MethodsIn vitro transcription and mRNA-LNP productionThe HA and NA constructs were codon optimized to enhance protein expression and reduce immunogenicity. The codon optimized sequences were gene synthetized at GenScript (New Jersey, USA) and cloned into an in vitro transcription template plasmid containing a T7 promoter, 5′ and 3′UTR regions, and a 100-nucleotide poly (A) tail. mRNA was synthetized and co-transcriptionally capped using the Megascript transcription kit™ (ThermoFisher, Cat# AMB 1334) and the CleanCap™ dinucleotide system (TriLink Biotechnologies), precipitated, and purified using a modified cellulose based chromatography method72. Length and mRNA integrity were assessed using the native agarose gel (1.4%). Removal of double stranded RNA (dsRNA) contaminants was confirmed using dot blot and endotoxin levels were measured using the Genscript Toxisensor chromogenic assay (<0.05 EU/mL). The different HA and NA mRNA were stored frozen (1 mg/mL) at −20 °C in nuclease and pyrogen free water until use. mRNA was encapsulated into lipid nanoparticles as previously described73. A mixture of an ionizable lipid (proprietary to Acuitas Therapeutics), cholesterol, DSPC, and PEG-Lipid in an ethanolic solution was rapidly mixed with an aqueous phase containing the mRNA, dialyzed, concentrated to 1 mg/mL and stored at −80 °C until used. The ionizable lipid and LNP composition are described in patent application WO 2017/004143A1. mRNA-LNP were characterized for their hydrodynamic size, and polydispersity index (PDI) using dynamic light scattering (DLS), and the encapsulation efficiency and concentration measured using the RiboGreen™ RNA Assay (Invitrogen, Cat# R11490).Cell lines293T (CRL-3216) and Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK, CCL-34) cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2. 293 T cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagles medium (DMEM, GibcoTM) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), GlutaMAXTM (GibcoTM), and penicillin-streptomycin (P/S), and MDCKs were maintained in minimal essential medium supplemented with 5% FBS, HEPES, sodium bicarbonate, GlutaMAXTM and penicillin-streptomycin. All media was supplemented with Plasmocin prophylactic (Invitrogen, ANT-MPP) to prevent mycoplasma contamination.PlasmidsFor plasmids used for experiments in Fig. 1 and cell-based ELISAs, all viral protein sequences were obtained through NCBI and cloned into pCAGGs expression plasmids using human-codon optimized gBlocks with an artificial Kozak sequence (IDT) (Protein accession numbers: A/Victoria/2570/2019 NA, WEY08939; A/Victoria/2570/2019 HA, WEY08940; A/Tasmania/503/2020 NA, WMW30851; A/Tasmania/503/2020 HA, WMW30850, T176K, S202R; B/Washington/02/2019 NA, QCG86179; B/Washington/02/2019 HA, QCG86180; B/Phuket/3073/2013 NA, EPI544263; B/Phuket/3073/2013 HA, EPI544264). PCR products were inserted into the pCAGGs expression vector using the EcoRI and NheI restriction sites and HiFi DNA Assembly (New England BioLabs [NEB], Cat #E5520). DNA products were transformed into chemically competent NEB 5-alpha high-efficiency cells (NEB, Cat. C2987H) and purified plasmids were then confirmed using Sanger sequencing.HA stalk design and expressionOur HA stalk constructs were designed to express the viral stalk ectodomain, anchored by the transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail. H1N1 A/Victoria/2570/2019 HA (accession: WEY08940) stalk-only design was based on the Gen6 HA-SS design used in Yassine et al.74, and H3N2 A/Tasmania/503/2020 HA (accession: WMW30850: T176K, S202R) stalk-only design was based on the ‘H3ssF_C’ design used in Corbett, K. S., et al.75. For both designs, amino acid (aa) numbering began at the initiator methionine. Briefly, for H1N1 design, the region between aaL49 and L328 was replaced with a GSG linker domain, and region between aaM402 and T436 was replaced with a GSGGSG linker. Four additional mutations were added to promote correct folding of the stalk: K394M, Y437D, N438L, E446L. Briefly, for H3N2 stalk-only design, aa66-329, aa407-408, and aa412-436 were deleted. The following mutations were also inserted: aa60-65 (QNSSIG to FPGCGV), K396M, L397V, L400V, G402E, K403L, T404M, N405E, E406Q, H409G, Q410G, I411P, W437D, S438C, N440L, E448L, and N461R. Human codon-optimized gBlocks (IDT) were designed according to the A/Victoria/2570/2019 and A/Tasmania/503/2020 sequences and used to clone into the pCAGGs expression vector using Gibson assembly. These constructs were validated to have the correct trimeric structure using the conformation-specific monoclonal antibody, CR9114 (produced by the Moody laboratory at Duke University) (Supplementary Fig. 3).Confocal microscopy293T cells were seeded onto poly-L-lysine treated coverslips in 24-well plates and then transfected with the indicated plasmid in OptiMeM™ (GibcoTM, #31985070) using Trans-IT-LT1 (MIR #2304) transfection reagent and allowed to incubate at 37 °C for 24 h. Cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and blocked with 3% BSA in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (w/v) for two hours at room temperature and stained with 9H10 (10 μg/mL) or anti-N2 antibody (Sino Biological, #40017-RP01-100, 1:1000) in PBS/BSA overnight at 4 °C. Cells were washed with PBS then incubated with secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse AF488 (Invitrogen, #A11001) and goat anti-rabbit AF647 (Invitrogen, # A21245)) diluted 1:1000 in 3% BSA in PBS for 2 h at room temperature. Coverslips were finally washed again, stained for nuclei using Hoechst 33342 (Life Technologies, Cat. #H3570, 1:2500), then mounted onto slides (Prolong Diamond #P36961). Slides were imaged using an inverted IX83 Olympus microscope with a motorized XY-stage (Prior Scientific) and images were processed identically using ImageJ (NIH).HA fusion assay293T cells were seeded onto poly-L-lysine treated coverslips in 24-well plates to reach high confluency the next day. Cells were then transfected with the indicated plasmid in OptiMeM™ using LipofectamineTM 3000 (Invitrogen, #L3000001) and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Medium was replaced with OptiMeM™ supplemented with 0.35% BSA, 0.01% FBS and 5% P/S with 1 μg/mL TPCK-trypsin for 20 min, and then cells were treated with either DMEM at pH = 7.4 or DMEM acidified using citric acid at pH = 5 for 20 min. All medium was then replaced with fresh DMEM at pH = 7.4 and cells were allowed to recover at 37 °C for 4 h. Cells were then fixed with 2% PFA and stained with 20 μg/mL Wheat Germ Agglutinin (WGA) (Vector Laboratories, #FL-1021-5) fluorescent lectin in PBS for 1 h at room temperature and Hoescht 33342, according to the above described confocal microscopy protocol. Slides were then imaged on a confocal microscope according to the above described protocol.Vaccine dosesVaccine doses for mRNA-LNP vaccination were determined based on pre-existing vaccine doses used in Phase 3 clinical trials. Pfizer delivered 30 μg of mRNA-LNP vaccine to humans, so we decided to initially test 1/6th of this dose for mice, ~5 μg, and a similar 1/6th (10 μg) of the human dose of inactivated vaccine, Flulaval76,77. For experiments Fig. 2, mice were vaccinated with doses as follows: BSA, 10 μg; luciferase mRNA-LNP, 5.1 μg; NA mRNA-LNP, 2.275 μg; HA mRNA-LNP, 2.725 μg; NA mRNA-LNP, 2.275 and HA mRNA-LNP, 2.725 μg; NA-F2A-HA mRNA-LNP 5.1 μg; Flulaval, 10 μg. Size of mRNA transcript length were taken into account for the NA and HA proteins and roughly scaled accordingly. For experiments in Fig. 3, mice were vaccinated with doses as follows: luciferase mRNA-LNPs, 5 μg; NA-F2A-HA mRNA-LNP, 5 μg; Flulaval, 10 μg. For experiments in Fig. 4, mice were vaccinated with doses as follows: luciferase mRNA-LNP, 10 μg; four mRNA-LNP, 10 μg (2.5 μg of each H1N1, H3N2, IBV_V and IBV_Y NA-F2A-HA mRNA-LNPs; Flulaval, 10 μg. For ferret experiments in Fig. 5, 6-month old male ferrets (n = 4) were intramuscularly vaccinated with 30 μg of either luciferase mRNA-LNP or the four NA-F2A-HA mRNA-LNP mixture (7.5 μg of each NA-F2A-HA mRNA-LNP) or 60 μg of Flulaval in 500 μL PBS. In Supplementary Fig. 2, mice were first primed with either 10 μg of BSA, 10 μg of inactivated A/California/04/2009, A/Wyoming/03/2003, B/Malaysia/2506/2004, and B/Yamagata/16/1988 (2.5 μg of each virus) mix for ‘Pre-immune mix 1’ group, or 10 μg of Flulaval for ‘Pre-immune mix 2’ group, intramuscularly. Mice were then boosted with either 10 μg of BSA or 10 μg of the four mRNA-LNP mix (2.5 μg of each H1N1, H3N2, IBV-V and IBV-Y NA-F2A-HA mRNA-LNPs). In Supplementary Fig. 4, mice received 10 μg of BSA or 10 μg of Flulaval.Vaccination and challengeSix- to ten-week-old female DBA/2J mice from the Jackson Laboratory (#000671) were used for all experiments involving mice (n = 5 for all experiments shown). Mice were vaccinated intradermally (except for prime in Supplementary Fig. 2) with all vaccines to maintain consistency, unless otherwise noted. To confirm that Flulaval did not induce different immunogenicity when administered intradermally, we vaccinated mice both intradermally and intramuscularly with the same dose of Flulaval (10 μg) and saw no difference in antibody levels between groups (Supplementary Fig. 4). Three weeks post-vaccination, mice were bled via a cheek bleed to collect serum. Mice were allowed to recover for 2–3 days and then were challenged with virus. For viral infections, mice were anesthetized with 100 μL of ketamine/xylazine and infected intranasally with 40 μL of virus diluted in pharmaceutical grade PBS (Corning, 21-040-CV). Mice were challenged with the following doses of virus: Fig. 2, H3N2 dose = 1000 PFU; Fig. 4, H1N1 dose = 200 PFU, H3N2 dose = 100 PFU, and IBV_Y dose = 396,000 PFU. After infection, mouse bodyweight was recorded daily for 14 days and mice were sacrificed if bodyweight fell below the predetermined humane endpoint (75% of starting body weight). For ferret experiments, 6-month old male ferrets were first bled three days prior to vaccination, then were intramuscularly vaccinated with the intended vaccines. At 28 days post-vaccination, ferrets were bled again and oral swabs were taken. Ferrets were then infected with 500 μL of virus (intended dose = 1000 PFU of A/Hawaii/66/2019) intranasally after inhalation of isoflurane at 31 days post-vaccination. Ferrets were monitored for change in bodyweight, and oral swabs were obtained at days 2, 4, and 7 post-infection. Animal viral titer was determined using standard plaque assays on MDCK cells using oral swabs in duplicate dilution series. All ferret experiments were conducted in the Duke Regional Biocontainment Laboratory with their independent viral stocks.Ethics statementAll experiments involving animals were approved by Duke Univeristy IACUC under the protocol numbers A142-21-07 (mouse) and A077-23-03 (ferret). Animals were housed in ambient temperature and humidity with free access to food and water and with a 12 h light/dark cycle.VirusesIAV viruses were propagated on MDCK cells or in eggs at 37 °C, and IBV viruses were grown at 33 °C on MDCK cells or in eggs. All viral stocks were then titered using standard plaque assays on MDCK cells. The A/Tasmania/503/2020, B/Phuket/3073/2013, B/Colorado/06/2017 viruses were obtained from BEI resources. To generate the “pre-immune” vaccine, IAV and IBV viruses (A/California/04/2009, A/Wyoming/03/2003, B/Malaysia/2506/2004 and B/Yamagata/16/1988) were propagated on eggs at either 37 °C or 33 °C and then viral stocks were concentrated using a 30% sucrose cushion via ultracentrifugation (27,500 rpm for 1 h). Concentrated viruses were resuspended in pharmaceutical grade PBS (Corning, 21-040-CV) and inactivated with 0.02% formalin at 4 °C for 48 h. Inactivated viruses were then dialyzed using Slide-A-Lyzer cassettes (Thermo Fisher, #66370) and quantified using Pierce Rapid Gold BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher #A53226) and stored at −80 °C for future use. All viral stocks were sequence confirmed using reverse-transcription followed by Sanger sequencing of the HA, NA, and NP or PA proteins. Sequence alignments for HA percent homology were aligned using Clustal Omega v1.2.4. software. For viruses that did not induce robust clinical disease in mice or were not available, similar viral strains with HA sequence homology >95% were chosen to be used (Supplementary Figs. 5–7).Enzyme-linked immunosorbance assays (ELISAs)For cell-based ELISAs, 293Ts were plated in poly-L-lysine-treated 96-well plates and then transfected with the indicated plasmid in OptiMeM™ using Trans-IT LT1 and left to incubate for 24 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Cells were then fixed with 2% PFA, washed with PBS, and then blocked in 3–5% nonfat milk in PBS (w/v). Serial dilutions of sera in nonfat milk in PBS were then added and allowed to incubate, followed by secondary antibody staining (goat anti-mouse HRP (Invitrogen, #A16072, 1:10,000), goat anti-human HRP (Invitrogen, #A18805, 1:10,000) or goat anti-ferret HRP (Novus Biologicals, #NB7224, 1:10,000). Plates were finally washed again before 1-Step TMB ELISA Substrate Solutions (Fisher Scientific, #PI34028) was added. Signal was allowed to develop until the reaction was stopped with 1 M H2SO4. Absorbance of signal at 450 nm was then read on a Varioskan LUX plate reader. The area under the curve (AUC) for each ELISA was calculated using the average of wells with no primary antibody added as the baseline cutoff, using Prism 9 (GraphPad). For non cell-based ELISAs, ImmunoGrade 96-well plates (BrandTech, #781722) were coated with 0.2 μg/well of the target antigen or 1.0 × 105 PFU/well whole virus in coating buffer (PBS with NaHCO3 and Na2CO3) overnight at 4 °C. Plates were then blocked and signal developed using the same protocol described above. For ELISAs using ferret sera, initial sera dilutions in 3% milk were briefly incubated with 293T cells to reduce background reactivity. Cells were pelleted, then mixed with sera dilutions for 10 min, pelleted again, and the supernatant was then used in the rest of the ELISA protocol as described above.Hemagglutinination inhibition assays (HAIs)Sera from vaccinated mice was diluted 1:4 with receptor-destroying enzyme (RDE, Denka Seiken #370013) and incubated for 16–20 h at 37 °C, followed by inactivation of the RDE with incubation at 56 °C for 45 min. Sera was serially diluted in PBS in 96-well V-bottom microplates (Corning, #CLS3897), then mixed with equal volume of standardized virus dilution (2 HA units) and allowed to incubate at room temperature for 15 min. Turkey red blood cells were then diluted 1:40 in PBS and added to each well of sera/virus mixture. Plates were covered and left to incubate at 4 °C overnight before HAI titers were recorded. HAI titers were calculated as the reciprocal of the last dilution of sera that inhibited hemagglutination, indicated by a clear red blood cell pellet.Enzyme-linked lectin assays (ELLAs) and neuraminidase inhibition assays (NAIs)For both ELLA assays and NAI assays, immuno-grade 96-well plates were coated with 100 μL 25 mg/mL fetuin (Sigma #F3385) in 1x coating buffer (KPL coating buffer #50-84-10) for at least 24 h at 4 °C before the experiment was conducted. Fetuin-coated plates which were thoroughly washed with PBS-T (0.05% Tween-20). For ELLA assays to detect neuraminidase activity, 293T cells were transfected with plasmids using LipofectamineTM 3000 and left to incubate at 37 °C. At 24 h post transfection, cells were resuspended in OptiMeM™ supplemented with 0.35% BSA, 0.01% FBS and 5% penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were counted and all samples were normalized to the same cell concentration. Samples were added to fetuin-coated plates, firmly sealed, and incubated at 37 °C for 18 h. Plates were thoroughly washed with PBS-T, then peroxidase conjugated-peanut agglutinin-HRPO (1 mg/mL, Sigma #L7759, 1:1000) was diluted in sample buffer and added to each well and left to incubate for 2 h in the dark at room temperature. Plates were washed again with PBS-T then signal was developed as previously described for ELISAs. To assess NAI using ELLAs, RDE-treated sera from vaccinated mice were serially diluted in sample buffer (Dulbecco’s PBS with CaCl2 and MgCl2, Gibco, with 0.5% Tween-20) and added to fetuin-coated plates. Recombinant N2 (Sino Biologicals, #40017-VNAHC-800) was diluted in sample buffer and added to each well (except for a no N2 control). Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 18 h, and signal was developed as previously described for ELLAs. NA activity was calculated as the following percentage: ((serum absorbance-mean background absorbance)/(mean positive control absorbance-mean background absorbance))*100. NAI titer is reported as the reciprocal of the lowest dilution of sera that inhibited greater than or equal to 50% NA activity.Microneutralization assays (MN50)RDE-treated sera from vaccinated mice were serially diluted in 96-well microplates in sample diluent (PBS/BSA with 0.1% TPCK-trypsin (Thermo #20233)). Each plate also included virus positive control wells and uninfected negative control wells. Virus suspension was prepared in sample diluent and an equal volume (containing 32,000 PFU A/Tasmania/503/2020 virus) was added to each well containing sera dilutions except the uninfected control wells. The virus-serum mixtures were allowed to incubate at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 1 h, before an equal volume of MDCK cells (containing 1 × 104 cells) was added to each well on top of the virus-serum mixtures. Plates were incubated for 20 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2, and then were fixed with 4% PFA. Plates were thoroughly washed with wash buffer (PBS + 0.3% Tween-20), then monoclonal human-anti influenza HA-stalk antibody (CR9114) was diluted 1:4000 in antibody diluent (wash buffer + 5% nonfat milk) and added to each well for overnight incubation at 4 °C. Plates were washed with wash buffer then goat-anti human-HRP secondary antibody (1:10,000) was diluted 1:5000 in antibody diluent and added to each well for 1 h at room temperature. Plates were washed with wash buffer a final time, and signal was developed as previously described for ELISAs. The reaction was stopped using 1 M H2SO4 and plates’ absorbances at 450 nm were read using a Varioskan LUX plate reader. In calculating the half-maximal inhibitory titer (MN50), the virus control wells for each plate were set to 100% and the uninfected negative controls were set to 0%. A four-parameter nonlinear regression was then applied to each plate individually using Prism 9 (GraphPad), and the MN50 was interpreted as the log 10 of the lowest dilution of sera that inhibited virus greater than or equal to 50% of control viral infection.Plaque-reduction neutralization assays (PRNT50)RDE-treated sera were serially diluted in PBS/BSA, then each dilution was mixed with standardized virus suspension and allowed to incubate for 45 min at room temperature. Confluent 6-well plates of MDCK cells were washed with PBS then infected with the virus/sera mixtures for 1 hour at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Virus/sera mixtures were then removed and replaced with an agar overlay supplemented with TPCK-trypsin. PRNTs were left to incubate for 48–72 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2 until plaques were visible. PRNTs were then fixed for at least 3 hours at room temperature with 4% PFA, before the agar overlay was removed and replaced with CR9114 antibody diluted in antibody dilution buffer (5% nonfat dried milk, 0.05% Tween-20 in PBS, 1:1000) overnight at 4 °C. PRNTs were then washed with PBS and incubated with goat anti-human HRP diluted in antibody dilution buffer for 1 h at room temperature (1:4000). Finally, PRNTs were washed again and stained with KPL TrueBlueTM peroxidase substrate (SeraCare, #95059–168). PRNTs were then dried, and plaques were counted. PRNT50 titer is reported as the reciprocal of the lowest dilution of sera that inhibited greater than or equal to 50% the number of plaques as the no antibody, infected control.qRT-PCRViral RNA was isolated from ferret oral swabs throughout infection using the Qiagen QIAmp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Cat #52904). Purified RNA extracted from 140 μL of oral swab was then stored at −80 °C until further use. For samples with limited oral swab volume, RNA was extracted from 70 μL of sample and then 2x the measured RNA value was used in subsequent analyses. One-step qRT-PCR was then performed using EXPRESS One-Step Superscript qRT-PCR kit (Invitrogen, #11781200) on an Applied Biosystems QuantStudio 3 Real-Time PCR System. Custom TaqMan probes synthesized by IDT were used to target the viral RNA of the A/Hawaii/70/2019 NP segment (Forward primer: 5′-CAGTGAGTACCCTTCCCTTTC-3′,reverse primer:5′-CTGAGAGGATCAGTTGCACATA-3′,Probe:5′-/56-FAM/TGTGTGTAT/ZEN/GGGCTTGCAGTAGCA/3IABkFQ/-3′). Endogenous eukaryotic 18S rRNA (Applied Biosystems, #4319413E) was also targeted as an endogenous control.Influenza HA productionRecombinant HA (rHA) were purchased from Sino Biological, the IRR, the Duke CIVICs Reagent Core, or produced by GenScript as indicated in Supplementary Table 1. For rHA produced by Genscript, the soluble full-length ectodomains for the HAs of the influenza strains cloned into pFastBac expression constructs containing a T3-fribitin (FoldOn) trimerization domain and C-terminal hexa-His tag as described78. Baculoviruses from Sf9-transfected cells were used to infect Sf9 cells cultured in Sf-900TM II SFM medium (Life Technologies, #10902104). Three days post-infection, the rHA were purified by Ni-NTA column.Multiplex HA binding assaysrHA or BSA (Sigma – negative control) were conjugated to magnetic microspheres (Luminex Corp.) by carbodiimide coupling using the manufacturer’s protocol. rHA- and BSA-conjugated microspheres (1500 of each) were mixed with 10-fold serially-diluted samples diluted 1:100 to 1:10,000,000 in PBS, 1% BSA pH = 7.4 (assay buffer; bioWorld), incubated for 60 min at room temperature on an orbital shaker and then washed in assay buffer. Microspheres were incubated with 10 μg/mL phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated goat anti-ferret IgG heavy & light chains (Abcam #ab112768 conjugated to PE using a Lightning-Link labeling kit (Abcam)) for 30 min, washed in assay buffer, and the PE median fluorescence intensity (MFI) of each microsphere population measured using an Intelliflex DR-SE bead reader (Luminex). Data were analyzed using Bio-Plex Manager v.6.2. Different HAs exhibited parallelism and dilutional linearity at different sample dilutions, and so for each HA, the raw result was calculated as the average background-corrected MFI from duplicate wells at the first dilution at which the data appeared parallel and linear for all samples. These MFI values were then each normalized to the values of luciferase mRNA-LNP vaccinated animals within each HA, then log transformed to obtain the reported values. These normalized MFI values are shown individually for each animal. HAs for which neither four mRNA-LNP- nor Flulaval-vaccinated animals had a statistically significantly higher normalized MFI value compared to luciferase mRNA-LNP-vaccinated animals are not reported.Graphing and statistical analysesExperiments were graphed using Prism 9 (GraphPad Software) and all statistical analysis was performed using R statistical software (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). Initially, comparaisons of more than two groups were performed using a Kruskal–Wallis test. If the resulting p < 0.05, a Wilcoxon rank-sum test was performed to compare each pairs of groups. The Benjamini–Hochberg procedure was applied within each figure panel to control the false discovery rate (FDR) for multiple comparaisons. All tests were two-sided, with an alpha level of 0.05. All experiments were performed in two independent experiments unless otherwise noted. For data in which groups were overlapping over the same values, groups were nudged apart vertically or horizontally to help distinguish groups. For sample groups that yielded values below/above the LOD in their assays, groups were assigned an arbitrary value below the LOD to be included in the graph and in statistical analysis. Schematics featured in figures were created using BioRender.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.

(Getty Images) Pasteurization appears to kill the virus present in milk, but raw products may pose an infection risk The University of Georgia is partnering with the Food and Drug Administration to test U.S. dairy supplies for avian influenza. UGA is one of five institutions nationwide helping to ensure the safety of dairy products during the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza A (H5N1) outbreak to reduce the threat of avian influenza to human and animal health. The UGA Center for Influenza Disease and Emergence Research, a Center of Excellence in Influenza Research and Response, will lead the university’s efforts. Funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (CEIRR No. 202175N93021C00018), the center is one of only six such institutions focusing on the history, transmission and progression of influenza nationwide. S. Mark Tompkins “This virus and its spread are concerning,” said S. Mark Tompkins, director and principal investigator of the UGA center. “I worry about the changing ecology of this virus, the sustained spread of H5N1 across dairy farms, and our ability to take the steps to address it.” Avian influenza virus detected in U.S. dairy supply Commonly known as bird flu, H5N1 is found in wild aquatic birds across the globe and can cause outbreaks and disease in poultry. In recent years, the virus has evolved to infect more than 100 mammalian species, including bears, foxes and even a dolphin. It can also infect people. While extremely rare, avian influenza can spread from person to person. H5N1 was detected in U.S. dairy cattle for the first time this year, prompting concerns about the safety of the country’s dairy supply. We have the potential of people becoming infected through consumption of unpasteurized milk, cheese or other dairy products.” — S. Mark Tompkins, College of Veterinary Medicine While the virus has been detected in raw milk from infected cows, pasteurization appears to kill H5N1, which makes it unlikely to infect people through consumption. Raw dairy products, however, are another story. “The concern is that there is a substantial population that prefers unpasteurized dairy products,” said Tompkins, who also serves as a professor of virology and immunology in UGA’s College of Veterinary Medicine. “The risk of falling ill from salmonella or listeria contamination of raw dairy products has been recognized for many years. “Now, with the possibility of contamination of the milk supply with H5N1 influenza virus, we have the potential of people becoming infected through consumption of unpasteurized milk, cheese or other dairy products. Those infections provide an opportunity for the virus to gain a foothold and spread in humans.” Center for Influenza Disease and Emergence Research College of Veterinary Medicine Columns Research FacebookXPinterestLinkedIn You may also like Campus News Challenges in global health discussed during 2024… Campus News Experience the magic at UGA’s State Botanical Garden… Campus News A shared harvest Campus News College of Education, Boys and Girls Club host… Campus News CAES researchers prepare students to address complex… Campus News Graduate programs administrator keeps students on the… The online newspaper for the University of Georgia community Research news from across the University of Georgia Events More EventsArchives Archives Select Month November 2024 October 2024 September 2024 August 2024 July 2024 June 2024 May 2024 April 2024 March 2024 February 2024 January 2024 December 2023 November 2023 October 2023 September 2023 August 2023 July 2023 June 2023 May 2023 April 2023 March 2023 February 2023 January 2023 December 2022 November 2022 October 2022 September 2022 August 2022 July 2022 June 2022 May 2022 April 2022 March 2022 February 2022 January 2022 December 2021 November 2021 October 2021 September 2021 August 2021 July 2021 June 2021 May 2021 April 2021 March 2021 February 2021 January 2021 December 2020 November 2020 October 2020 September 2020 August 2020 July 2020 June 2020 May 2020 April 2020 March 2020 February 2020 January 2020 December 2019 November 2019 October 2019 September 2019 August 2019 July 2019 June 2019 May 2019 April 2019 March 2019 February 2019 January 2019 December 2018 November 2018 October 2018 September 2018 August 2018 July 2018 June 2018 May 2018 April 2018 March 2018 February 2018 January 2018 December 2017 November 2017 October 2017 September 2017 August 2017 July 2017 June 2017 May 2017 April 2017 March 2017 February 2017 January 2017 December 2016 November 2016 October 2016 September 2016 August 2016 July 2016 June 2016 May 2016 April 2016 March 2016 February 2016 January 2016 December 2015 November 2015 October 2015 September 2015 August 2015 July 2015 June 2015 May 2015 April 2015 March 2015 February 2015 January 2015 December 2014 November 2014 October 2014 September 2014 August 2014 July 2014 June 2014 May 2014 April 2014 March 2014 February 2014 January 2014 December 2013 November 2013 October 2013 September 2013 August 2013 July 2013 June 2013 May 2013 April 2013 March 2013 February 2013 January 2013 December 2012 November 2012 October 2012 September 2012 August 2012 July 2012 June 2012 May 2012 April 2012 March 2012 February 2012 January 2012 December 2011 November 2011 October 2011 September 2011 August 2011 July 2011 June 2011 May 2011 April 2011 March 2011 February 2011 January 2011 December 2010 November 2010 October 2010 September 2010 August 2010 July 2010 June 2010 May 2010 April 2010 March 2010 February 2010 January 2010 December 2009 November 2009 October 2009 September 2009 August 2009 July 2009 June 2009 May 2009 April 2009 March 2009 February 2009 January 2009 December 2008 November 2008 October 2008 September 2008 August 2008 July 2008 June 2008 May 2008 April 2008 March 2008 February 2008 January 2008 December 2007 November 2007 October 2007 September 2007 August 2007 July 2007 June 2007 May 2007 April 2007 March 2007 February 2007 January 2007 December 2006 November 2006 October 2006 September 2006 August 2006 July 2006 June 2006 May 2006 April 2006 March 2006 February 2006 January 2006 December 2005 November 2005 October 2005 September 2005 August 2005 July 2005 June 2005 May 2005 April 2005 March 2005 February 2005 January 2005 December 2004 November 2004 October 2004 September 2004 August 2004 July 2004 June 2004 May 2004 April 2004 March 2004 February 2004 January 2004 December 2003 November 2003 October 2003 September 2003 August 2003 July 2003 June 2003 May 2003 April 2003 March 2003 February 2003 January 2003 University of Georgia Schools and Colleges Directory MyUGA Employment Opportunities Copyright and Trademarks Privacy Website Feedback #UGA on © University of Georgia, Athens, GA 30602 706‑542‑3000CDC: 35% flu vaccine efficacy in South America may predict similar for US season | CIDRAP Skip to main content University of Minnesota Main navigationMain content University of Minnesotahttp:/win-cities.umn.edu/612-625-5000 Go to the U of M home page Main navigation News Antimicrobial Resistance COVID-19 Chronic Wasting Disease Influenza Mpox All Topics A-Z Resilient Drug Supply Influenza Vaccines Roadmap CIDRAP Leadership Forum Roadmap Development Coronavirus Vaccines Roadmap . .

On August 29, the CDC forecasted that the upcoming flu season "will be similar to or lower than that of the 2023-2024 season rate of 8.9 weekly laboratory-confirmed hospitalizations per 100,000, with moderate confidence," it wrote. "However, past seasons have varied widely in the number of illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths, depending on the subtypes circulating, population immunity to different subtypes, and vaccine effectiveness against circulating subtypes."Campaign targeted high-risk groupsThe researchers used a test-negative, case-control design to analyze data from a multinational surveillance network to generate estimates of interim vaccine effectiveness (VE) against hospitalization with flu-related severe acute respiratory illness (SARI).The study population was made up of 11,751 SARI patients from three Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) vaccination target groups: young children (58.3%), older children and people with underlying medical conditions (14.5%), and older adults (27.2%). Case-patients had SARI and tested positive for flu, while control patients had SARI and tested negative for flu and COVID-19. Data were pooled from 30 hospitals in Argentina, 2,477 in Brazil, 13 in Chile, 5 in Paraguay, and 10 in Uruguay beginning 2 weeks after each country's flu vaccination campaign. Vaccination status was confirmed using national electronic vaccination records.All countries used World Health Organization (WHO)–recommended egg-based Southern Hemisphere formulations. Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Uruguay used trivalent (three-strain) vaccines containing antigens from A/Victoria/4897/2022 (H1N1)pdm09–like virus, A/Thailand/8/2022 (H3N2)–like virus, and B/Austria/1359417/2021 (B/Victoria lineage)–like virus, while Paraguay used quadrivalent (four-strain) vaccines that also contained the B/Yamagata lineage–like virus.Vaccination rate lower than prepandemic normsThe five countries reported 11,751 flu-related SARI cases and an average low seasonal flu vaccination rate. "The documented influenza vaccination coverage levels (21.3%) were below pre–COVID-19 norms," the researchers wrote. "This finding is consistent with postpandemic declines in vaccination coverage across the Americas associated with vaccine misinformation, hesitancy, and disruptions in routine immunization services, prevalent during the COVID-19 pandemic." The vaccine effectiveness estimated is within the confidence interval of prior H3N2 (34%–53%) and H1N1 (18%–56%) for this Southern Hemisphere network. Erica Zeno, PhD The adjusted VE was 34.5% against hospitalization, 36.5% against the predominant A(H3N2) influenza substrain, and 37.1% against the A(H1N1)pdm09 substrain. VE was 58.7% among patients with chronic conditions, 39.0% among young children, and 31.2% among older adults."The vaccine effectiveness estimated is within the confidence interval of prior H3N2 (34%–53%) and H1N1 (18%–56%) for this Southern Hemisphere network," Zeno said. "It is lower than what was observed in the United States last season, but that was on the high-end of the historic range."As of July 19, too few influenza B cases were available to estimate VE, the authors said. Adjusted VE against SARI from any flu virus was 42.2% in Argentina, 30.3% in Brazil, 56.9% in Chile, and 61.0% in Uruguay; VE was not calculated for Paraguay because of insufficient data. A sensitivity analysis excluding Brazil estimated an adjusted VE of 56.5%.In total, 32.7% of SARI patients tested positive for flu, and 98.6% of identified viruses were influenza A. Only 0.7% of patients were infected with influenza B, all of which were of the B/Victoria lineage. Of 61.9% of subtyped influenza A viruses, 68.3% were A(H3N2), and 31.7% were A(H1N1)pdm09. Most (59.2%) of the case-patients were older adults, followed by people with chronic conditions (50.4%), and the lowest proportion of cases (16.0%) occurred among young children.Vaccination can reduce illness severity, death"While flu vaccine effectiveness can vary from season to season, we know that influenza vaccination can offer significant protection for people who get vaccinated and is the best protection against influenza," Zeno said. "Importantly, influenza vaccination also can reduce severity of illness in people who get vaccinated but still get sick." To enhance this year’s modest influenza vaccine protection against hospitalization, providers should treat patients with suspected or confirmed influenza as soon as possible with antivirals. Vaccination is one of the most effective interventions to prevent flu-related complications, including death, the authors said. "Annual influenza vaccination should be encouraged for young children, persons with comorbidities, and older adults," the authors wrote. "To enhance this year’s modest influenza vaccine protection against hospitalization, providers should treat patients with suspected or confirmed influenza as soon as possible with antivirals.""Influenza vaccine postintroduction evaluations and knowledge, attitudes, and practices surveys might identify additional reasons for low coverage and strategies for improved coverage for the next Southern Hemisphere season," they added.

Flu Vaccine Facts It takes about 2 weeks for protection to develop after vaccination. Influenza vaccine does not cause flu. Influenza vaccine may be given at the same time as other vaccines, including the COVID-19 vaccine. With rare exceptions, everyone 6 months of age and older should get an annual flu vaccine by the end of October. Flu Vaccine Benefits Reduces risk of flu illness Reduces visits to the doctor Reduces hospitalizations and deaths related to flu illness A new CDC study found that people who had received a flu vaccine were half as likely to be hospitalized with flu compared to people who had not been vaccinated. Who Should Get the Flu Vaccine? Everyone 6 months or older High-risk groups: Adults 65 and older Adults with chronic conditions People who are pregnant People with disabilities People living with HIV Cancer patients and survivors Racial and ethnic minority groups Healthcare workers Caregivers for people in high-risk groups or for infants younger than 6 months old Flu Vaccine and COVID-19 The influenza vaccination will not prevent COVID-19, but it is the best way to minimize the risk of flu. COVID-19 is caused by infection with the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and flu is caused by infection with influenza viruses. Flu and COVID-19 disease share many of the same symptoms --- fever, headache, sore throat, muscle aches, and fatigue. These similarities may make illnesses more difficult to diagnose and treat. Getting a flu vaccine will reduce the chances of possible misdiagnosis and getting both diseases at the same time. It's safe to get the flu vaccine and the COVID-19 vaccine at the same time.

The first flu virus isolated from pigs was influenza A H1N1 in 1930. This virus is a subtype of influenza that is named for the composition of the proteins hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) that form its viral coat. Since the 1930s three other subtypes of flu viruses also have been isolated from pigs, including H1N2, H3N1, and H3N2. The emergence of H3N2 in pigs occurred in the late 1990s and is suspected of having been transmitted to pigs from humans. Although swine influenza viruses are similar to the influenza viruses that circulate among humans, swine viruses possess distinct antigens (molecules that induce an immune response). Symptoms and transmission Between 25 and 30 percent of pigs worldwide carry antibodies to swine influenza viruses, which indicates that these animals have been exposed to swine flu. The disease is endemic in pigs in the United States, and in some regions of that country more than 50 percent of pigs carry antibodies to swine influenza viruses. Infection with any of these viruses causes a flulike illness in pigs, which typically occurs in the fall and early winter. Symptoms of infection include coughing (barking), fever, and nasal discharge, and illness generally lasts about a week. The virus is spread rapidly among pigs and is easily spread to birds and humans who come into contact with the pigs or contaminated food or bedding or who inhale infectious particles in the air. Humans infected with swine influenza virus may experience fever and mild respiratory symptoms, such as coughing, runny nose, and congestion. Some persons experience diarrhea, chills, and vomiting. Swine influenza virus rarely causes death in humans. Britannica Quiz 44 Questions from Britannica’s Most Popular Health and Medicine Quizzes A well-documented outbreak of swine flu in humans occurred in 1976 in New Jersey, U.S., at Fort Dix army base, where severe respiratory illness was observed in a small group of recruits and caused one death. Although the virus isolated from the recruits was identified as swine influenza, the origin of the virus was unknown. Treatment and prevention There are no specific drugs available for swine flu in pigs, and treatment is thus supportive. Providing a clean and dry environment and keeping infected pigs separate from healthy pigs are essential approaches to controlling the disease. In many cases, antibiotics are administered to prevent the emergence of bacterial infection. Outbreaks of swine flu in pigs can be prevented through vaccination against the viruses. The spread of the virus among pigs also can be controlled through sanitary practices, such as disinfecting areas that were occupied by infected pigs, disposing of contaminated bedding, and washing hands after handling infected animals.Kara RogersUS study uncovers antiviral resistance in swine-origin influenza, urging enhanced pandemic surveillance Skip to content Menu Medical Home Life Sciences Home Become a Member Search Medical Home Life Sciences Home About COVID-19 News Health A-Z Drugs Medical Devices Interviews White Papers More...

Chaphalkar, PhD.Reviewed by Susha Cheriyedath, M.Sc.Oct 9 2024 Swine-origin influenza viruses show mutations that resist antiviral drugs, posing a pandemic risk and highlighting the urgent need for ongoing surveillance and updated treatment strategies. Study: Antiviral Susceptibility of Swine-Origin Influenza A Viruses Isolated from Humans, United States. Image Credit: NIAID In a recent study published in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases, researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States of America (US) analyzed genome sequences of swine-origin influenza A viruses. They conducted phenotypic assays to establish subtype-specific susceptibility baselines for antiviral drugs. The findings contribute significantly to ongoing pandemic preparedness efforts, highlighting the need for vigilant monitoring of swine-origin influenza A viruses, which pose a continuous threat of reassortment and the potential for new pandemic strains. They found that nearly all viruses had the S31N M2 resistance marker, two showed baloxavir resistance-related substitution mutations, and only the I38M substitution significantly reduced baloxavir susceptibility by 27-fold. These results underscore the importance of understanding antiviral resistance patterns in swine-origin viruses, as genetic mutations and reassortments could reduce the effectiveness of current antiviral treatments. Background Swine-origin influenza viruses (S-OIVs) are enzootic in pig populations worldwide, making pigs a key "mixing vessel" where human, bird, and pig influenza viruses can combine, increasing pandemic risks. Swine influenza A viruses, consisting of H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2 subtypes, are enzootic globally and can mix with human and avian viruses, leading to reassortments with pandemic potential. Since the late 1990s, North American swine viruses have acquired a triple-reassortment internal gene (TRIG) cassette from human, avian, and classical swine viruses. The 2009 pandemic A(H1N1)pdm09 virus emerged from such reassortment and has since been reintroduced into pigs, increasing viral diversity. The continuing introduction of human pandemic strains back into swine populations creates opportunities for further reassortment, which complicates public health preparedness efforts and highlights the zoonotic threat posed by these viruses. Variant swine-origin viruses are monitored under the World Health Organization’s (WHO’s) International Health Regulations due to their potential for generating new pandemic strains. Influenza antiviral drugs face challenges from genetic mutations, reassortments, and antiviral resistance, especially for matrix-2 (M2) blockers. Resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors and the continuing threat of antiviral-resistant strains highlight the need for ongoing surveillance and risk assessment of swine-origin influenza viruses. In particular, the study provides critical data on subtype-specific baselines for drug susceptibility, a key step in refining global antiviral susceptibility testing methodologies. About the study Swine flu symptoms in humans resemble typical influenza, including fever, cough, and muscle pains, but swine influenza viruses have a higher potential for reassortment due to genetic diversity. All the procedures were conducted in enhanced Biosafety Level 2 laboratories. Various reagents and methodologies were employed to test variant influenza viruses. Neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) such as oseltamivir, zanamivir, peramivir, and laninamivir were dissolved in sterile distilled water, while baloxavir acid was prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide. Broadly cross-reactive monoclonal antibodies FI6v3 and CR9114 were used for neutralization assessments, and antiserum from ferrets was treated with a receptor-destroying enzyme prior to use. The study revealed a wide range of neutralization activity for these antibodies across subtypes, with some variant viruses showing low or no neutralization even at high antibody concentrations. This variability underscores the challenges in developing monoclonal antibody therapies against swine-origin influenza viruses, as antigenic differences outside known epitopes may reduce their effectiveness. Control experiments utilized CDC antiviral susceptibility reference virus panels. For genetic analysis, whole-genome sequences were generated and analyzed. Results and Discussion From January 2013 to April 2024, 167 human infections caused by variant influenza viruses were reported across 22 US states, including A(H1N1)v, A(H1N2)v, and A(H3N2)v cases. Genetic analysis of 147 variant viruses identified molecular markers related to antiviral resistance. All except one variant had a resistance-conferring substitution (S31N) in the M2 protein, while no known markers for neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) were detected. The study provides critical insights into antiviral resistance mechanisms, emphasizing the importance of molecular surveillance in identifying markers that could affect treatment outcomes. However, A/Iowa/02/2021 (H1N1)v had the S247N substitution, which reduces oseltamivir inhibition for A(H5N1). A few substitutions linked to reduced baloxavir susceptibility were also found in the polymerase acidic protein. Susceptibility assessments showed that all variant viruses retained susceptibility to NAIs, with most displaying potent inhibition by oseltamivir, zanamivir, peramivir, and laninamivir. A(H1N2)v exhibited higher half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values compared to the other subtypes. For baloxavir, A/Iowa/33/2017 (H1N1)v showed 27-fold lower susceptibility due to the I38M substitution, while other viruses did not show any effect. This significant reduction in baloxavir susceptibility highlights the potential for resistance mutations to compromise antiviral efficacy, particularly in swine-origin viruses. Antigenic analysis indicated that recent variant viruses showed reduced reactivity to candidate vaccine viruses, pointing to antigenic evolution in swine-origin influenza viruses. Neutralization assays using human monoclonal antibodies targeting hemagglutinin (HA) revealed varying neutralization efficacy across subtypes, with CR9114 being slightly more effective against A(H1)v. However, the broad variability in neutralization efficacy suggests that current vaccine candidates may require updating to keep pace with the antigenic changes observed in swine-origin viruses. Overall, the study highlights the need for continuous monitoring of antiviral susceptibility in variant influenza viruses to ensure that therapeutic strategies remain effective against emerging strains. While the study improves our understanding of the epidemiology, susceptibility, and potential threat of variant influenza viruses, it is limited by incomplete virus testing, challenges in interpreting phenotypic data, and assay-dependent variability in antiviral susceptibility results. The study notes that phenotypic data interpretation is particularly challenging due to the lack of standardized correlates for clinically relevant resistance and assay variability. The findings underscore the importance of establishing subtype-specific baselines and harmonizing laboratory methodologies to improve the accuracy of antiviral susceptibility assessments. Conclusion In conclusion, the study provides an approach to standardizing testing methodologies for swine-origin influenza viruses and improving the interpretation of laboratory results, ultimately enhancing our understanding of viruses that present a potential pandemic threat. By refining antiviral susceptibility testing and tracking antigenic evolution in swine-origin viruses, the research offers vital insights into public health preparedness and pandemic risk assessment.

Conroy, M.D., Chair, American Hospital Association Autumn is here, and that means cooler weather and also the start of flu season.We know the best way to prevent influenza is to get a flu vaccine. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that everyone age 6 months or older get vaccinated, with rare exceptions, to help reduce the risk of flu and avoid serious, flu-related illnesses, hospitalization and even death. All U.S. flu vaccines will be trivalent for the 2024–2025 season, protecting against three different influenza viruses. The AHA is once again collaborating with national partners in leading the United Against the Flu campaign to encourage the public to get vaccinated. Visit AHA.org/flu for helpful information and resources, including the CDC’s flu shot finder and promotional messaging. Beginning this month through mid-March, the AHA team will create monthly social media kits with shareable posts that your teams can use to spread the word across your organization’s social channels.Flu is not our only nemesis as fall and winter weather sets in. COVID-19 and RSV also are prevalent. Staying up to date and protected against these viruses is important. So when people get vaccinated against the flu, the CDC encourages getting other vaccinations — like the COVID-19 or RSV vaccine — if the timing is right and their health provider recommends it.The adage that “the best defense is a good offense” aptly describes getting vaccinated. Getting the flu, COVID-19 and other recommended vaccines helps protect ourselves, our loved ones and our communities. It’s a winning strategy for staying healthy.

Chaphalkar, PhD.Reviewed by Susha Cheriyedath, M.Sc.Oct 9 2024 Swine-origin influenza viruses show mutations that resist antiviral drugs, posing a pandemic risk and highlighting the urgent need for ongoing surveillance and updated treatment strategies. Study: Antiviral Susceptibility of Swine-Origin Influenza A Viruses Isolated from Humans, United States. Image Credit: NIAID In a recent study published in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases, researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States of America (US) analyzed genome sequences of swine-origin influenza A viruses. They conducted phenotypic assays to establish subtype-specific susceptibility baselines for antiviral drugs. The findings contribute significantly to ongoing pandemic preparedness efforts, highlighting the need for vigilant monitoring of swine-origin influenza A viruses, which pose a continuous threat of reassortment and the potential for new pandemic strains. They found that nearly all viruses had the S31N M2 resistance marker, two showed baloxavir resistance-related substitution mutations, and only the I38M substitution significantly reduced baloxavir susceptibility by 27-fold. These results underscore the importance of understanding antiviral resistance patterns in swine-origin viruses, as genetic mutations and reassortments could reduce the effectiveness of current antiviral treatments. Background Swine-origin influenza viruses (S-OIVs) are enzootic in pig populations worldwide, making pigs a key "mixing vessel" where human, bird, and pig influenza viruses can combine, increasing pandemic risks. Swine influenza A viruses, consisting of H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2 subtypes, are enzootic globally and can mix with human and avian viruses, leading to reassortments with pandemic potential. Since the late 1990s, North American swine viruses have acquired a triple-reassortment internal gene (TRIG) cassette from human, avian, and classical swine viruses. The 2009 pandemic A(H1N1)pdm09 virus emerged from such reassortment and has since been reintroduced into pigs, increasing viral diversity. The continuing introduction of human pandemic strains back into swine populations creates opportunities for further reassortment, which complicates public health preparedness efforts and highlights the zoonotic threat posed by these viruses. Variant swine-origin viruses are monitored under the World Health Organization’s (WHO’s) International Health Regulations due to their potential for generating new pandemic strains. Influenza antiviral drugs face challenges from genetic mutations, reassortments, and antiviral resistance, especially for matrix-2 (M2) blockers. Resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors and the continuing threat of antiviral-resistant strains highlight the need for ongoing surveillance and risk assessment of swine-origin influenza viruses. In particular, the study provides critical data on subtype-specific baselines for drug susceptibility, a key step in refining global antiviral susceptibility testing methodologies. About the study Swine flu symptoms in humans resemble typical influenza, including fever, cough, and muscle pains, but swine influenza viruses have a higher potential for reassortment due to genetic diversity. All the procedures were conducted in enhanced Biosafety Level 2 laboratories. Various reagents and methodologies were employed to test variant influenza viruses. Neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) such as oseltamivir, zanamivir, peramivir, and laninamivir were dissolved in sterile distilled water, while baloxavir acid was prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide. Broadly cross-reactive monoclonal antibodies FI6v3 and CR9114 were used for neutralization assessments, and antiserum from ferrets was treated with a receptor-destroying enzyme prior to use. The study revealed a wide range of neutralization activity for these antibodies across subtypes, with some variant viruses showing low or no neutralization even at high antibody concentrations. This variability underscores the challenges in developing monoclonal antibody therapies against swine-origin influenza viruses, as antigenic differences outside known epitopes may reduce their effectiveness. Control experiments utilized CDC antiviral susceptibility reference virus panels. For genetic analysis, whole-genome sequences were generated and analyzed. Results and Discussion From January 2013 to April 2024, 167 human infections caused by variant influenza viruses were reported across 22 US states, including A(H1N1)v, A(H1N2)v, and A(H3N2)v cases. Genetic analysis of 147 variant viruses identified molecular markers related to antiviral resistance. All except one variant had a resistance-conferring substitution (S31N) in the M2 protein, while no known markers for neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) were detected. The study provides critical insights into antiviral resistance mechanisms, emphasizing the importance of molecular surveillance in identifying markers that could affect treatment outcomes. However, A/Iowa/02/2021 (H1N1)v had the S247N substitution, which reduces oseltamivir inhibition for A(H5N1). A few substitutions linked to reduced baloxavir susceptibility were also found in the polymerase acidic protein. Susceptibility assessments showed that all variant viruses retained susceptibility to NAIs, with most displaying potent inhibition by oseltamivir, zanamivir, peramivir, and laninamivir. A(H1N2)v exhibited higher half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values compared to the other subtypes. For baloxavir, A/Iowa/33/2017 (H1N1)v showed 27-fold lower susceptibility due to the I38M substitution, while other viruses did not show any effect. This significant reduction in baloxavir susceptibility highlights the potential for resistance mutations to compromise antiviral efficacy, particularly in swine-origin viruses. Antigenic analysis indicated that recent variant viruses showed reduced reactivity to candidate vaccine viruses, pointing to antigenic evolution in swine-origin influenza viruses. Neutralization assays using human monoclonal antibodies targeting hemagglutinin (HA) revealed varying neutralization efficacy across subtypes, with CR9114 being slightly more effective against A(H1)v. However, the broad variability in neutralization efficacy suggests that current vaccine candidates may require updating to keep pace with the antigenic changes observed in swine-origin viruses. Overall, the study highlights the need for continuous monitoring of antiviral susceptibility in variant influenza viruses to ensure that therapeutic strategies remain effective against emerging strains. While the study improves our understanding of the epidemiology, susceptibility, and potential threat of variant influenza viruses, it is limited by incomplete virus testing, challenges in interpreting phenotypic data, and assay-dependent variability in antiviral susceptibility results. The study notes that phenotypic data interpretation is particularly challenging due to the lack of standardized correlates for clinically relevant resistance and assay variability. The findings underscore the importance of establishing subtype-specific baselines and harmonizing laboratory methodologies to improve the accuracy of antiviral susceptibility assessments. Conclusion In conclusion, the study provides an approach to standardizing testing methodologies for swine-origin influenza viruses and improving the interpretation of laboratory results, ultimately enhancing our understanding of viruses that present a potential pandemic threat. By refining antiviral susceptibility testing and tracking antigenic evolution in swine-origin viruses, the research offers vital insights into public health preparedness and pandemic risk assessment.

Those are a few developments as, notably this fall, “Flu shots here” sandwich boards begin to compete with election signs. Within the past year, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved RSV vaccines produced by a handful of biopharmaceutical companies that are for people 60 and over. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that adults 75 and older, and adults 60 to 74 who are at higher risk, receive a single dose of the RSV vaccine. “We already have evidence that that’s reducing the number of RSV infections, which is great news,” said Jenna Guthmiller, PhD, assistant professor of immunology and microbiology at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. “Secondly, there was (FDA) approval for a monoclonal antibody against RSV that is being given to newborns, and it can provide protection for about six months … It could really be the difference between your kid getting RSV and not.” In the following Q&A, Guthmiller explains the new trivalent flu vaccine, talks about the combination mRNA coronavirus-flu vaccine on the horizon, and shares tips on other ways to protect against getting the flu virus in the months ahead. Recently, 2021-22 saw a long flu season in the United States. Do you have a sense on the type of flu season, possibly severe, we might face this year? Yes, but severity and longevity of the season are two different things. Longevity-wise, the last few years have been pretty standard flu seasons. It typically begins late in December with peak months being January and February and then cases coming down. One thing to note, though, is that the season typically lasts between December and the end of April. But what’s quite interesting about that is there are two types of influenza that circulate in humans – influenza A and influenza B. Influenza A is the one that peaks first, while influenza B tends to be on the back end of the season, peaking around late February and into March, then going into April. COVID cases have surged in late summer and into fall. Is this trend expected to continue, and will it adversely impact the flu season? That’s kind of a difficult question, and I think there are a few ways you can look at it. Does the fact that there’s an outbreak of COVID impact the severity of flu? The answer to that is no. These are two different viruses. It’s not common to get infected with more than one virus at a time, so there aren’t really concerns on that front. The bigger concern is you get infected with one and then a few weeks later you get infected by the other one, which certainly is not uncommon and makes for an unhappy person. It’s not necessarily going to make your flu infection worse or make your COVID infection worse that they’re co-circulating together. It’s just that you could potentially get two respiratory viruses in a relatively short amount of time that may make you not feel great. The other thing, from a healthcare standpoint, is we certainly know that these respiratory infection seasons can be very draining on hospital resources, beds, things of that nature. Getting a flu vaccination is a great way to help prevent yourself from being hospitalized and contributing to that surge. Moderna is working on a vaccine that the company says will offer, in a single shot, protection against both the coronavirus and influenza viruses. What do you think of this development? So currently, with the clinical trials of at least the flu vaccine – the one using Moderna’s mRNA technology – there’s really not any difference in the efficacy compared to the standard-of-care flu vaccines that we receive. But where it can be very attractive is that it’s one shot – you don’t have to get multiple injections, especially if you’re afraid of needles. It also simplifies booking because you’ve just got to book one vaccine, one trip. It’s more convenient, and the immunity you get from it is going to be similar to getting the vaccines separately. Is there any benefit to getting the COVID booster and the flu shot at the same time? The recommendation is that you get both, and the CDC says that there’s no problem with getting them at the same time. For convenience, I would definitely recommend just going and getting them at the same time. Why is the flu vaccine formulated as a trivalent this year, as opposed to the quadrivalent of recent years? So, it means it’s going to be for H1N1 and H3N2, which are strains of influenza A, and then one for the influenza B virus. Pre-COVID, we had two distinct lineages of influenza B viruses – one was B/Yamagata lineage and the other was B/Victoria lineage. The B/Yamagata lineage has not been observed since March 2020, so people in the flu field are very optimistic that, because of the COVID precautions put in place, the virus ended up going extinct. And importantly, influenza B is only in humans, and so if it’s not in us, then it likely has gone extinct. So, people are quite excited about that. Just to note, if you looked at the ratios of influenza B infections pre-COVID, it was 90 to 95% B/Victoria lineage and only about 5% B/Yamagata. So, because it was already a small amount, those precautions were put in place and now we think it’s gone extinct. It takes a lot of time to grow these viruses to make the vaccines, so (by dropping the B/Yamagata strain), it’s going to decrease the amount of time it takes to make these vaccines. It’s going to decrease the price because (the formulation) is three-quarters of what it used to be. In the last decade, the B/Yamagata strain also evolved very slowly, and we don’t have any evidence that it’s still around, so why keep it in the vaccine? What are some general practices that people can do to avoid getting the flu during the respiratory virus season? So, the main one, of course, is to get the flu vaccine. Also, wash your hands frequently, especially during flu season, and try to avoid touching things like your face. Also, it’s important to be aware of situations where you’re around people who could be infected. If you’re going to the doctor’s office, it’s not a bad idea to put on a mask, especially during respiratory season. Similarly, if you are going to the clinic because you’re not feeling well, just wear a mask. Try to prevent that onward transmission. There is an analogy of the flu vaccine being like a seatbelt. To a degree, it can prevent you from getting infected, but it can’t completely stop you from getting in a car crash. You’re going to get exposed to these things, and it can help you try to avoid getting really sick, or injured in the case of a seatbelt.

Since 2020, the world has experienced an unprecedented H5 HPAI in animal populations. Countries across Africa, the Americas, Antarctica and Eurasia have been affected by the disease, including at least twenty countries and territories reporting H5 HPAI for the first time. Moreover, human cases have been confirmed positive for HPAI A(H5N1) virus, with exposure to dairy cattle. FAO has been a trusted partner in supporting pandemic prevention and preparedness for zoonotic influenza. It regularly collaborates with the WHO Global Influenza Programme, contributing with information sharing on animal influenza surveillance, participating in risk assessments (e.g. TIPRA), and supporting the WHO bi-annual influenza vaccine composition meetings with information provided through the joint WOAH-FAO scientific network on animal influenza (OFFLU) network of expertise on animal influenzas. These global efforts have created improved detection and response capacities in many countries. Considering the alarming spread of HPAI and the evolution of avian influenza in the wild birds and mammals, FAO in Geneva is organizing this FAO One Health Briefing on Avian Influenza: Update and Coordinated Response, to inform partners and permanent missions in Geneva of the latest scientific findings and knowledge to support development and implementation of disease prevention and control strategies and policies with focus on the animal health sector, as well as FAO and partners’ contribution to global efforts towards reducing pandemic risk.Programme:TimeDescription5 minWelcome remarks by Dominique Burgeon, Director of FAO Liaison Office in Geneva15 minFAO’s contribution to global efforts on avian influenza by Madhur Dhingra, Senior Animal Health Officer (Lead, Animal Health Prevention, Preparedness and Rapid Response Cluster), FAO20 minRemarks by WHO, WOAH and UNEP - Maria Van Kerkhove, Director of Epidemic and Pandemic Preparedness and Prevention Department (EPP), WHO - Gounalan Pavade, Scientific Coordinator, Science Department of World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) - Ruth Cromie, Coordinator of Task Force on AI and Wildlife & Dagmar Zikova, Scientific Adviser, Convention on Migratory Species of UNEP15 minQ&A discussion session facilitated by Julio Pinto, Animal Health Officer (One Health), FAO5 minClosing remarks by Thanawat Tiensin, Assistant Director-General (ADG), FAO For more information, please contact [email protected] or [email protected] Register Contact Julio Pinto, Animal Health Officer[email protected]Xiaoyi Wang, Liaison Specialist[email protected] WeChat Follow us on FAO Organizational Chart Worldwide offices Regional Office for Africa Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific Regional Office for Europe and Central Asia Regional Office for Latin America and the Caribbean Regional Office for the Near East and North Africa Country Offices Jobs Contact us Terms and Conditions Data protection and privacy Scam Alert Report Misconduct Transparency and accountability © FAO 2024WHO Releases Influenza Vaccine Recommendations for the 2025 Southern Hemisphere Season Subscribe to Newsletter Discovery & Development Drug Delivery The Changing Face of Influenza Vaccination Flu changes, ever so slightly, year by year and region by region. The vaccine manufacturing industry must bring changes of its own. Rob Coker | 10/08/2024 | News Credit: AdobeStock.comThe WHO has released its recommendations for the composition of influenza vaccines for the 2025 Southern Hemisphere season. This guidance is based on global influenza surveillance data collected from February to August 2024, which showed varying levels of influenza activity across different regions. The report highlighted that influenza activity was higher than the same period in 2023, with the Americas experiencing particularly high detections. The most common viruses across most regions were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2). In Asia, influenza B/Victoria lineage viruses were prevalent early in the year, followed by a rise in Influenza A detections. In Africa and Oceania, an array of subtypes was observed, each with specific regional patterns of spread. Based on these trends, the WHO recommends manufacturers prepare the following virus strains for inclusion in the 2025 Southern Hemisphere influenza vaccines:Egg-based Vaccines:A/Victoria/4897/2022 (H1N1)pdm09-like virusA/Croatia/10136RV/2023 (H3N2)-like virusB/Austria/1359417/2021 (B/Victoria lineage)-like virusCell Culture-, Recombinant Protein-, or Nucleic Acid-based Vaccines:A/Wisconsin/67/2022 (H1N1)pdm09-like virusA/District of Columbia/27/2023 (H3N2)-like virusB/Austria/1359417/2021 (B/Victoria lineage)-like virus The recommendations also include a B/Yamagata lineage component for quadrivalent vaccines, although its necessity is questioned because of the absence of B/Yamagata virus detections since March 2020.Reports suggest the number of US citizens accepting an annual flu vaccination has dropped from 194 million during the 2020-2021 influenza season, to 173 million in 2022-2023. The CDC estimated between 27 million and 54 million illnesses due to the virus, so the FDA has urged a Fall flu shot to help bring these numbers down. However, not everybody is au fait with having needles in their arms at a clinic, so what might the industry do to improve vaccination rates at home?AstraZeneca offers one option: FluMist, which is now approved by the FDA for home use in children as young as two and adults up to 49 years. As we await further reports on the efficacy – and popularity – of this method, it would be interesting to see the new, similar means of improving vaccination rates generated by the industry.

Vaccination remains the most effective way to prevent infection; however, due to the persistence of antigenic drift, vaccines must be updated annually. The selection of vaccine strains occurs months in advance of the influenza season to allow adequate time for production in eggs. RNA vaccines offer the potential to accelerate production and improve efficacy of influenza vaccines. We leveraged the nucleoside-modified RNA (modRNA) platform technology and lipid nanoparticle formulation process of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (BNT162b2; Comirnaty®) to create modRNA vaccines encoding hemagglutinin (HA) (modRNA-HA) for seasonal human influenza strains and evaluated their preclinical immunogenicity and toxicity. In mice, a monovalent modRNA vaccine encoding an H1 HA demonstrated robust antibody responses, HA-specific Th1-type CD4+ T cell responses, and HA-specific CD8+ T cell responses. In rhesus and cynomolgus macaques, the vaccine exhibited durable functional antibody responses and HA-specific IFN-γ+ CD4+ T cell responses. Immunization of mice with monovalent, trivalent, and quadrivalent modRNA-HA vaccines generated functional antibody responses targeting the seasonal influenza virus(es) encoded in the vaccines that were greater than, or similar to, those of a licensed quadrivalent influenza vaccine. Monovalent and quadrivalent modRNA-HA vaccines were well-tolerated by Wistar Han rats, with no evidence of systemic toxicity. These nonclinical immunogenicity and safety data support further evaluation of the modRNA-HA vaccines in clinical studies.

In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that influenza epidemics have resulted in 9.4 to 41 million illnesses, 100,000 to 710,000 hospitalizations, and 4900 to 52,000 deaths annually between 2010 and 20223. Vaccination is the foremost public health strategy to combat the annual disease burden and economic costs associated with seasonal influenza4,5. Licensed seasonal influenza vaccines target up to four influenza strains: two influenza A subtypes (H1N1 and H3N2) and two influenza B lineages (B/Yamagata and B/Victoria). The World Health Organization (WHO) and the United States Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) recently recommended the removal of the B/Yamagata lineage from seasonal influenza vaccines due to the lack of recent circulation of these viruses6,7Influenza hemagglutinin (HA) is the most abundant glycoprotein on the surface of influenza A and B viruses (IAV and IBV, respectively). The HA protein is responsible for recognition and attachment of the virus to sialic acid receptors and mediating virus entry into host cells8. Thus, HA is a major target of virus neutralizing antibodies and is a key antigen for influenza vaccine development. Small changes can occur in the influenza virus genome over time which lead to changes in the HA surface protein, known as antigenic drift. Annual updates to seasonal influenza vaccines are necessary to improve immune responses to new antigenic variants that have emerged since the previous season.Most licensed seasonal influenza vaccines rely on traditional egg-based manufacturing processes, which allow for large-scale production but are slow to respond to dynamic virus evolution9. Additionally, the egg-based manufacturing process may introduce adaptive mutations that result in antigenic differences between the vaccine-encoded strain and circulating virus strains which could negatively impact vaccine effectiveness10. Cell- and recombinant-based seasonal influenza vaccines do not require eggs for manufacturing and, therefore, avoid the risk of egg-based adaptation and egg supply shortages during avian influenza outbreaks11; however, they are significantly more expensive to produce12,13.Alternatively, nucleoside-modified mRNA (modRNA) vaccines allow for faster and more cost-effective manufacturing. The cell-free in vitro transcription process enables the production of large numbers of vaccine doses within a shorter time period than can be achieved with conventional vaccine platforms14. This capability has been proven with the modRNA vaccines used to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. It took only a few weeks from when the genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was made public (January 2020) to when the first doses of SARS-CoV-2 modRNA vaccines were manufactured for clinical testing (February 2020)15. modRNA vaccine technology, if applied to influenza, has the potential to enable efficient delivery of a seasonally updated vaccine while minimizing the risk of vaccine mismatch.For the first time, we describe the preclinical immunogenicity and safety of influenza modRNA vaccines (IRV), encoding full-length HA from seasonal human influenza strains, that utilize the modRNA platform technology and LNP formulation of the COVID-19 modRNA vaccine (BNT162b2; Comirnaty®) developed by Pfizer and BioNTech. This platform has a large database of information on different SARS-CoV-2 strains and has consistently been shown to be safe, well tolerated, immunogenic, and efficacious in the prevention of COVID-1916,17,18,19. Formulations of monovalent (mIRV), trivalent (tIRV), and quadrivalent (qIRV) modRNA-HA vaccines were tested for in vitro expression and immunogenicity in multiple animal species (mice, rhesus and cynomolgus macaques). Additionally, safety of both mIRV and qIRV was assessed in Wistar Han rats.ResultsMonovalent, trivalent, and quadrivalent modRNA-HA efficiently express IAV and IBV HA proteins in vitromodRNA constructs encoding codon-optimized, full-length HA proteins derived from A/Wisconsin/588/2019 (H1N1), A/Darwin/6/2021 (H3N2), B/Austria/1359417/2021 (B/Victoria), and B/Phuket/3073/2013 (B/Yamagata) were designed, synthesized, and encapsulated in LNPs. Expression of IAV and IBV HA from LNP-formulated mIRV, tIRV, and qIRV was confirmed in vitro. Influenza HA protein was expressed in HEK-293T cells in a dose-dependent manner from modRNA encoding the strain-specific HA antigen, as measured by flow cytometry (Supplementary Fig. 1A–D). The data demonstrate that the HA protein can be efficiently expressed from modRNA-HA vaccines regardless of valency (mIRV, tIRV, qIRV) or HA type (IAV or IBV).Mice immunized with mIRV exhibit higher functional antibody responses and polyfunctional T cell responses post-boost as compared to an adjuvanted inactivated QIVTo evaluate immunogenicity of a monovalent modRNA-HA vaccine, mice (10 animals/group) were immunized with two doses of mIRV encoding the HA antigen from A/Wisconsin/588/2019 (H1N1) or a licensed adjuvanted QIV comparator (Fluad®) delivered 28 days apart. Sera were collected at immunologically relevant timepoints for evaluation of the magnitude and functionality of humoral responses. HA-specific antibody titers were measured by a hemagglutination inhibition assay (HAI) (Fig. 1a) and a microneutralization assay test (MNT) (Fig. 1b). Three weeks after the first dose (Day 21), mIRV and the QIV comparator induced similar HAI and MNT titers against A/Wisconsin/588/2019 (H1N1), however, mIRV induced statistically significantly higher HAI and MNT titers after the second dose compared to QIV. Two weeks after the second dose of mIRV (Day 42), HAI titers increased more than 6-fold (Fig. 1a) and MNT titers increased 68-fold (Fig. 1b) above titers obtained after the first dose (Day 21).Fig. 1: Influenza modRNA-HA vaccination elicits robust antibody and polyfunctional T cell responses in mice.Female naïve BALB/c mice were immunized IM with two doses (prime + boost) of a monovalent modRNA-HA (H1) vaccine (mIRV; 0.2 μg; 10/group), a QIV comparator (Fluad®; 2.4 μg; 10/group), or saline (5/group). Functional antibody and virus neutralization responses against the mIRV strain A/Wisconsin/588/2019 (H1N1) were measured by HAI (a) and 50% MNT (b), respectively, on Days 21 (3 weeks post-prime) and 42 (2 weeks post-boost). Titers in (a, b) are reported as GMT with 95% CI. Each data point represents one animal. Statistical comparisons were performed using an independent sample t-test, ***p ≤ 0.0001. In the same study, T cell responses were analyzed by ICS using an HA peptide pool to stimulate T cells ex vivo using splenocytes harvested on Day 42. ICS assay results are expressed as mean ± SEM of the % of IFN-γ+ CD4+ T cells (c), IL-4+ CD4+ T cells (d), polyfunctional (IFN-γ+, IL-2+, TNF-α+, CD154+) CD4+ T cells (e), IFN-γ+ CD8+ T cells (f), and polyfunctional (IFN-γ+, TNF-α+, CD107a+) CD8+ T cells (g). Each data point represents one mouse.

Immunization with two doses of mIRV induced a higher percentage of IFN-γ-producing CD4+ T cells than IL-4-producing CD4+ T cells (Fig. 1c), indicative of a Th1-biased response, whereas two doses of QIV induced a higher percentage of IL-4+ CD4+ T cells than IFN-γ+ CD4+ T cells (Fig. 1d), indicative of a Th2-biased response. A strong polyfunctional (IFN-γ+, IL-2+, TNF-α+, CD154+) CD4+ T cell response was also observed with the mIRV vaccine, but not with QIV (Fig. 1e). In addition, immunization with mIRV induced higher levels of IFN-γ+ CD8+ T cells (Fig. 1f) and polyfunctional (IFN-γ+, TNF-α+, CD107a+) CD8+ T cells (Fig. 1g) compared to QIV.Rhesus and cynomolgus macaques immunized with mIRV exhibit durable functional antibody responses and polyfunctional T cell responsesTo evaluate durability of the modRNA platform, immunogenicity of mIRV was evaluated in two species of NHPs, rhesus and cynomolgus macaques, for approximately 5 months following vaccination. A licensed comparator was not included in this study to limit animal numbers. Previously published studies have characterized the immune response to inactivated influenza vaccines, demonstrating induction of vaccine-specific antibody responses and variable cellular immune responses20,21,22,23,24,25. A total of three animals per group were immunized with two doses of mIRV (H1) 28 days apart. HA-specific antibodies were measured by HAI (Fig. 2a, b) and MNT (Fig. 2c, d). Vaccination with one dose of mIRV elicited a consistent pattern of HA-specific antibody responses against the homologous vaccine strain (A/Wisconsin/588/2019), inducing both HAI and neutralizing antibodies at three and four weeks after the first dose (Day 21 and Day 28) (Fig. 2a–d). Following the second immunization, HA-specific antibody levels peaked at one week after the second dose (Day 35) and then waned over the measured period of 19 weeks but stayed above baseline levels (Day -7). HAI and MNT titers plateaued from Day 105 through Day 168 of the study, maintaining levels comparable to those measured after the first dose (Day 21). T cell immunity was quantified by measuring cytokine-expressing peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T cells after ex vivo stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with HA peptide pools derived from the H1N1 vaccine strain (Fig. 2e, f). Immunization with mIRV induced IFN-γ-expressing CD4+ T cells with responses peaking approximately one week after the second dose (Day 35) and returning to baseline levels by Day 105 for both species. No change in peripheral CD8+ T cells was detected in either species after immunization (data not shown). Overall, the data provide evidence that an HA-containing modRNA vaccine elicits robust and durable humoral and cellular immune responses.Fig. 2: Influenza modRNA-HA vaccination elicits robust and durable antibody responses and CD4+ T cell responses in nonhuman primates.Rhesus and cynomolgus macaques were immunized IM with two doses (prime + boost) of a monovalent modRNA-HA (H1) vaccine (mIRV; 30 μg; 3/group). Functional antibody and virus neutralization responses against the mIRV strain A/Wisconsin/588/2019 (H1N1) were measured by HAI (a, b) and 50% MNT (c, d) 7 days before immunization (D-7); 7, 21, and 28 days after the prime; and 7, 14, 49, 77, 105, and 140 days after the boost (D35, D42, D77, D105, D133, and D168, respectively). Titer results are shown for rhesus (a, c) and cynomolgus (b, d) macaques. Each data point represents an individual NHP and the bar depicts the GMT of the 3 NHPs per group with 95% CI. In the same study, T cell responses were analyzed by ICS using an HA peptide pool to stimulate T cells ex vivo using PBMCs collected on D-7, D7, D35, D42, D77, D105, D133, and D168. ICS assay results are plotted as the % of IFN-γ+ cells within CD4+ T cell subsets for rhesus (e) and cynomolgus (f) macaques. Each data point represents an individual NHP and the bar depicts the median of the 3 NHPs per group with 95% CI.

The qIRV encoded HAs from the WHO-recommended influenza strains for cell culture- or recombinant-based vaccines for use in the 2021–2022 northern hemisphere influenza season: A/Wisconsin/588/2019 (H1N1), A/Cambodia/e0826360/2020 (H3N2), B/Washington/02/2019 (B/Victoria), and B/Phuket/3073/2013 (B/Yamagata)26. Mice were immunized with two doses of qIRV or licensed adjuvanted QIV 28 days apart. Two weeks after the second immunization, functional antibodies against each of the four strains encoded by the vaccines were measured by HAI (Fig. 3a) and MNT (Fig. 3b). Immunization with qIRV induced statistically significant higher HAI and MNT titers against H1N1 and H3N2, and similar HAI and MNT titers against B/Victoria and B/Yamagata compared to QIV (Fig. 3a, b).Fig. 3: Quadrivalent influenza modRNA-HA vaccination elicits antibody responses to all four strains in mice.Female naïve BALB/c mice were immunized IM with two doses (prime + boost) of a quadrivalent modRNA-HA vaccine (qIRV; 0.8 μg (0.2 μg/HA); 10/group), a QIV comparator (Fluad®; 2.4 μg; 10/group), or saline (10/group). Functional antibody and virus neutralization responses against each of the four qIRV strains, A/Wisconsin/588/2019 (H1N1), A/Cambodia/e0826360/2020 (H3N2), B/Washington/02/2019 (B/Victoria), and B/Phuket/3073/2013 (B/Yamagata), were measured by HAI (a) and 50% MNT (b), respectively, on Day 42 (2 weeks post-boost). Due to reagent limitations, mouse sera from all groups (n = 10) were pooled in pairs for analysis and were not tested individually. All titers are reported as GMT with 95% CI. Each data point represents two paired animals. Statistical comparisons were performed using an independent sample t-test, ***, p ≤ 0.0001; ns not significant.

To assess if a trivalent (tIRV) modRNA vaccine could perform as well as a qIRV modRNA vaccine for the three shared vaccine strains, we compared the immunogenicity of tIRV and qIRV to one another and to licensed adjuvanted QIV in mice. mIRVs targeting the individual vaccine strains were evaluated in parallel to assess any possible interference between IAV and IBV components of the multivalent IRVs that could result in lower immunogenicity. In this study, the modRNA-HA vaccines encoded HAs from the WHO-recommended influenza strains for cell culture- or recombinant-based vaccines for use in the 2022–2023 northern hemisphere influenza season: A/Wisconsin/588/2019 (H1N1), A/Darwin/6/2021 (H3N2), B/Austria/1359417/2021 (B/Victoria), B/Phuket/3073/2013 (B/Yamagata)27. Two weeks after the second immunization, virus neutralization titers against the vaccine-matched strains were measured by MNT (Fig. 4). Neutralization titers elicited by mIRV, tIRV, or qIRV against the shared vaccine strains (H1N1, H3N2, and B/Vic) were not statistically different (Fig. 4a–c) indicating an absence of interference. Neutralization titers against B/Yamagata elicited by mIRV and qIRV were also not statistically different (Fig. 4d). Notably, all three modRNA-HA vaccine formulations induced statistically significantly higher virus neutralizing titers against H1N1 (Fig. 4a) and B/Victoria (Fig. 4c) than the licensed QIV comparator. Neutralization titers against H3N2 (Fig. 4b) and B/Yamagata (Fig. 4d) were similar between the modRNA-HA vaccine formulations and the QIV control.Fig. 4: Virus neutralization titers elicited by monovalent, trivalent, and quadrivalent influenza modRNA-HA vaccines in mice.Female naïve BALB/c mice were immunized IM with two doses (prime + boost) of a monovalent (mIRV; 0.2 μg; 10/group), trivalent (tIRV; 0.6 μg (0.2 μg/HA); 10/group), or quadrivalent (qIRV; 0.8 μg (0.2 μg/HA); 10/group) modRNA-HA vaccine, a QIV comparator (Fluad; 2.4 μg; 10/group), or saline (10/group). Virus neutralization responses against each of the IRV-targeted strains (a) A/Wisconsin/588/2019 (H1N1), (b) A/Darwin/6/2021 (H3N2), (c) B/Austria/1359417/2021 (B/Victoria), and (d) B/Phuket/3073/2013 (B/Yamagata), were measured by 50% MNT on Day 42 (2 weeks post-boost). All titers are reported as GMT with 95% CI. Each data point represents one animal. Statistical comparisons were performed using an ANOVA and Tukey’s multiple comparisons test, ***, p ≤ 0.0001; ns not significant.

Briefly, male and female Wistar Han rats were administered 2 doses of mIRV or qIRV two weeks apart (Days 1 and 15). Dosing phase animals were euthanized two days after the second dose (Day 17) while recovery phase animals were euthanized approximately three weeks following the second dose (Day 38–39).In-life findingsIn the repeat-dose toxicity studies, administration of mIRV and qIRV was tolerated without evidence of systemic toxicity. There were no vaccine-related mortalities, clinical signs, or effects on injection site dermal scores or ophthalmoscopic parameters. Transiently higher mean body temperature was observed for both mIRV (both sexes) (Supplementary Fig. 2A) and qIRV (males only) (Supplementary Fig. 2B) on Days 1 (1.01x–1.03x controls; 38.65 °C: p < 0.01 and 37.75 °C: p < 0.05, respectively) and 15 (1.01–1.02x controls; 38.71 °C: p = 0.05 females and 37.15 °C–38.14 °C: p < 0.01 males). Vaccine-related transiently lower mean body weight was observed for both mIRV and qIRV in males only on Day 4 (0.96x control; p < 0.05) (Supplementary Fig. 2C, D) due to body weight loss and an associated decrease in mean food consumption (0.85x–0.84x controls; p < 0.01) and recovered by Day 8. Transiently lower mean food consumption was also observed on Day 4 (0.89x control; p < 0.01) in the female group administered qIRV, with recovery by Day 8 (Supplementary Fig. 2D). Transient slightly lower mean body weight and food consumption effects were associated with the observed acute phase protein response (higher A2M and A1AGP). There was no effect on mean body weight or food consumption in the recovery phase for either vaccine. The effects on body weight and body temperature were similar to findings reported with COVID-19 modRNA vaccines28.SerologyTo confirm immunogenicity of both vaccine formulations administered in rats, functional antibodies titers were measured by HAI. An HAI response was detected in rats at the end of the dosing and recovery phases for all strains encoded by mIRV (Supplementary Fig. 3) and qIRV (Supplementary Fig. 4). Hemagglutinin inhibition was not observed in the saline control animals.Clinical pathologyKey clinical pathology observations in rats were similar for both mIRV and qIRV and reflected the expected immune response following vaccination. Hematology findings were consistent with an inflammatory leukogram and included higher neutrophil counts on Days 3 and 17; a higher incidence of hyper-segmented neutrophils on Day 17; and higher monocytes, eosinophils, and/or large unstained cells on Days 3 and 17 (Fig. 5a, Supplementary Table 1). Findings consistent with an acute phase response were also noted for both vaccines and included higher fibrinogen on Day 17; higher globulin and/or lower albumin on Days 3 and 17; and higher alpha-2 macroglobulin (A2M) and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (A1AGP) on Days 3 and 17 (Fig. 5b–d, Supplementary Table 1). All clinical pathology changes recovered by the end of the recovery phase except for higher globulin and/or lower albumin (Supplementary Table 1). In addition, transient, slightly lower reticulocyte and/or platelet counts on Day 3 and a nominal prolongation in prothrombin time (PT) on Day 17 were observed for both vaccines (Supplementary Table 1), a spectrum of findings consistent with immune activation29,30,31 and similar to observations with COVID-19 modRNA vaccines28.Fig. 5: Clinical pathology and acute phase proteins in rats following vaccination with monovalent or quadrivalent influenza modRNA-HA.Neutrophil counts (a), fibrinogen concentrations (b), A2M concentrations (c), and A1AGP concentrations (d) in male (M) and female (F) Wistar Han rats immunized IM with two doses of mIRV (34 μg; 15/sex/group), qIRV (30 μg; 7.5 μg/HA; 15/sex/group), or saline (control). Blood samples were collected on Dosing Phase Days 3 and/or 17 and/or 39 (D3, D17, and D39, respectively). Box-and-whisker plots represent group medians (middle line), 25th and 75th percentiles (box), and min and max (lower and upper whiskers). All saline groups depicted in (a–d) are shown in black. A2M, alpha-2 macroglobulin; A1AGP, alpha-1-acid glycoprotein; IM, intramuscular.Full size imageAnatomic pathologyHistopathologic features were comparable between mIRV and qIRV vaccines, with similar non-adverse vaccine-related microscopic findings at the injection site and in the draining (iliac) and inguinal lymph nodes, spleen, bone marrow, thymus, and liver. Vaccine-related cell inflammation and edema ranging from minimal to mild were observed at the injection site (Fig. 6a, b). These findings are typically associated with the IM administration of LNP-encapsulated mRNA vaccines28,32 and correlated with macroscopic observations of abnormal color (dark). At the end of the recovery phase, full recovery of edema and dark injection site and partial recovery of inflammation (minimal) at the injection site was observed (Fig. 6c, d).Fig. 6: Histopathologic features of injection site, lymph node, and liver in rats following vaccination with monovalent influenza modRNA-HA.a Injection site section of mIRV (H1) immunized animals euthanized 2 days after the third dose (Day 17) showing inflammatory cells (arrows) admixed with pale eosinophilic fluid (edema) (black asterisk) infiltrating and expanding subcutaneous tissue and connective tissue of skeletal muscle. b 20x magnification of (a) showing inflammatory cells (mainly neutrophils with fewer plasma cells, macrophages, and lymphocytes) (arrows) and edema fluid (asterisk) surrounding myofibers. c Injection site section of mIRV immunized animals euthanized after a 3-week recovery showing fewer inflammatory cells infiltrating and expanding subcutaneous tissue and spaces around skeletal myofibers (arrows). d 20x magnification of (c) showing inflammatory cells (fewer plasma cells and lymphocytes) surrounding myofibers (arrows). e Lymph node sections of mIRV immunized animals showing prominent germinal centers (GC) and inflammatory cells (predominantly plasma cells) expanding sinuses (inset). f Liver sections of mIRV immunized animals euthanized 2 days after the third dose (Day 17) showing hepatocytes containing small clear round membrane bound structures within cytoplasm (black arrowheads).Full size imageVaccine-related findings in the draining lymph nodes (increased cellularity of plasma cells and germinal centers) (Fig. 6e), spleen (increased cellularity of hematopoietic cells and germinal centers) (Supplementary Fig. 5A), and bone marrow (increased cellularity of hematopoietic cells) (Supplementary Fig. 5B) were secondary to immune activation and/or inflammation at the injection site, as reported previously for the COVID-19 modRNA vaccine28. The presence of plasma cells in the draining and inguinal lymph nodes was interpreted to reflect a robust immunological response to the vaccines and correlated with enlarged draining lymph nodes after vaccine administration. Microscopic observations in the spleen correlated with increased splenic weights (Supplementary Table 2) and macroscopically enlarged spleens. At the end of the recovery phase, full recovery occurred for enlarged spleen, higher spleen weights, increased cellularity of hematopoietic cells in the spleen and bone marrow, and increased cellularity of germinal centers in the spleen. Partial recovery occurred for enlarged draining lymph nodes and increased cellularity of plasma cells and germinal centers in the draining and inguinal lymph nodes. An infiltration of macrophages in the draining and inguinal lymph nodes was observed with mIRV at the end of the recovery phase and was considered indicative of a reparative process (phagocytosis of material draining to the lymph node from the injection site).A microscopic finding of minimal decreased lymphocyte cellularity in the thymus was observed for mIRV and was considered secondary to stress (indicated by a slight decrease in body weight or food consumption or a slight increase in body temperature) and not directly related to the vaccine33. Decreased lymphocyte cellularity correlated with lower thymic weights (Supplementary Table 2). At the end of recovery phase, these findings were completely recovered.Microscopic findings of minimal periportal hepatocyte vacuolation were observed for both vaccines at the end of the dosing phase (Fig. 6f). This was not associated with microscopic or biochemical evidence of hepatocyte damage (no increases in ALT or AST) and was interpreted to reflect hepatocyte uptake of the LNP lipids, as observed previously28,34. At the end of the recovery phase, this finding was completely recovered.DiscussionEgg-based influenza vaccines comprise the majority of the influenza vaccine global market16. While egg-based manufacturing can support the production of large volumes at a low cost, the process takes approximately six months and can be impacted by egg supply shortages. Furthermore, passaging influenza viruses in eggs during manufacturing can introduce egg-specific mutations that alter the antigenicity of the virus leading to mismatch between the vaccine strain and circulating viruses that may reduce vaccine efficacy as was seen for the H3N2 vaccine strain in the 2012–2013 influenza season35.Alternatively, modRNA vaccines have emerged as a powerful tool for the prevention of infectious diseases as evidenced by the critical role they played in the COVID-19 pandemic response. modRNA vaccine technologies offer the ability to rapidly produce large numbers of vaccine doses without the risk of mismatch associated with egg-based manufacturing, and at a lower cost than cell-based influenza vaccines13. The shorter production time can also help to mitigate impacts of viral evolution and antigenic drift on vaccine efficacy. In preclinical studies, influenza mRNA-LNP vaccines targeting HA have demonstrated robust antibody induction and T cell responses36,37, as well as protective efficacy against influenza virus challenge in multiple animal models38,39,40,41,42,43. Our studies described here support these prior preclinical observations and provide further evidence that modRNA-HA vaccines targeting seasonal influenza strains are immunogenic.Here, a modRNA-LNP platform16,17,18,19 was leveraged to develop seasonal influenza vaccines. HA antigens administered in monovalent and multivalent (tIRV, qIRV) formulations in equal doses per antigen exhibited consistent antibody responses specific to each HA subtype in mice, demonstrating that potency of modRNA-HA vaccines is preserved when multiple antigens are targeted. Studies in both mice and NHPs demonstrated that influenza modRNA-HA vaccines elicit a multi-faceted immune response characterized by strong HA-specific functional and neutralizing antibody responses as well as cell-mediated immune responses. Unadjuvanted monovalent and quadrivalent modRNA-HA vaccines induced similar or better HAI titers compared to an adjuvanted licensed QIV vaccine. An HAI titer of ≥1:40 is an accepted immunological correlate of protection against influenza infection in humans44,45.Influenza modRNA-HA vaccines induced robust T cell responses in mice and NHPs. In mice, modRNA-HA vaccination induced Th1-type CD4+ and IFN-γ+ CD8+ T cell responses, whereas vaccination with the licensed QIV comparator induced a Th2-type CD4+ T cell response and a minimal IFN-γ+ CD8+ T cell response. modRNA-HA vaccination also induced a Th1-type CD4+ T cell response in NHPs. Though a licensed inactivated influenza vaccine comparator was not evaluated in the NHP study, a prior study by Carroll et. al. evaluated the T cell response in rhesus macaques following vaccination with a licensed inactivated influenza vaccine (Fluzone®)22. Fluzone®-vaccinated NHPs mounted a CD4+ T cell response consisting of a higher proportion of influenza-specific IL-2- and TNF-secreting CD4+ T cells and a smaller proportion of influenza-specific IFN-γ-secreting CD4+ T cells; however, animals failed to retain the IFN-γ+ CD4+ T cells two weeks post-boost22. In contrast, in our study, modRNA-HA induced IFN-γ-expressing CD4+ T cells that peaked one week post-boost with measurable responses detected until Day 105 when levels returned to baseline.In the study by Carroll et al., influenza-specific IFN-γ+ CD8+ T cells were detectable in Fluzone®-vaccinated macaques, but only in a subset of animals22. In our study, IFNγ+ CD8+ T cell responses were observed in mice but not NHPs following modRNA-HA vaccination. The lack of CD8+ T cell activity observed in modRNA-HA-vaccinated NHPs is similar to observations from NHP studies of a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine46; however, vaccination of humans with COVID-19 mRNA vaccines has been shown to elicit durable CD8+ T cell responses47,48. In summary, T cell responses to influenza vaccines in NHPs may vary based on vaccine platform, use of adjuvant, route of administration, and animal species, and may not be fully predictive of responses in humans.The immune response elicited by the influenza modRNA-HA vaccines in preclinical animal studies aligns with clinical data from both SARS-CoV-2 and influenza modRNA vaccines. Data from a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of the BNT162b2 COVID-19 modRNA vaccine (NCT04368728) demonstrated that vaccination induced high levels of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titers as well as antigen-specific CD8+ and Th1-type CD4+ T cell responses19. Preliminary data from a Phase 2 trial of a quadrivalent influenza modRNA-HA vaccine (NCT05052697) also demonstrated the ability of modRNA vaccines to induce both neutralizing antibody responses and strain-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses49. The induction of influenza-specific T cell immunity has been associated with reduced disease severity and viral shedding as well as broadly protective heterosubtypic immunity50. Thus, the modRNA platform may provide benefits over currently licensed seasonal influenza vaccines which induce limited T cell immunity51,52,53. Studies to investigate the HA trimers produced from modRNA-HA and to further characterize the types of antibodies elicited following vaccination are ongoing or planned, and are beyond the scope of the current manuscript.Nonclinical toxicity of the modRNA-LNP platform has previously been assessed in rats using the BNT162 vaccine candidates BNT162b1, BNT162b2, and BNT162b3 which were tolerated at doses up to 100 µg without any evidence of systemic toxicity28. As demonstrated here, both monovalent and quadrivalent modRNA-HA influenza vaccines using the same LNP platform were also well tolerated and shared similar non-adverse findings and expected inflammatory responses to those seen after administration of the BNT162 modRNA vaccine candidates28. The reproducible, consistent toxicology findings observed between the COVID-19 and influenza modRNA vaccines support the consideration of modRNA-LNP as a safe and tolerable vaccine platform technology that could be utilized to target a new viral variant or pathogen by changing the RNA-encoded target antigen.Altogether, the data presented here demonstrate the ability of modRNA vaccines to induce robust, balanced humoral and cellular immune responses to influenza with a tolerable nonclinical safety profile. This data, along with platform biodistribution data from the COVID-19 vaccine program, were used to support a first-in-human (FIH) Phase 1 trial of Pfizer’s modRNA influenza vaccines (NCT05052697) which have since advanced to Phase 3 testing (NCT05540522). modRNA vaccines represent a promising approach for improving influenza vaccine efficacy to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with seasonal influenza epidemics.MethodsFormulation of the monovalent, trivalent, and quadrivalent modRNA-HA vaccinesModRNA-HA vaccines encoding full-length HA proteins of WHO-recommended strains for cell culture- or recombinant-based vaccines for use in either the 2021–2022 (A/Wisconsin/588/2019 (H1N1), A/Cambodia/e0826360/2020 (H3N2), B/Washington/02/2019 (B/Victoria), and B/Phuket/3073/2013 (B/Yamagata))26 or 2022–2023 (A/Wisconsin/588/2019 (H1N1), A/Darwin/6/2021 (H3N2), B/Austria/1359417/2021 (B/Victoria), and B/Phuket/3073/2013 (B/Yamagata))27 northern hemisphere influenza seasons were individually formulated and prepared as either monovalent, trivalent, or quadrivalent formulations as previously described for the BNT162b2 modRNA vaccine17. Stock concentrations of modRNA-HA were diluted in saline to achieve the desired dose for vaccine administration in animals.In vitro expression of HA from the influenza modRNA-HA vaccineIndividually LNP-formulated modRNAs encoding full-length HA from H1N1, H3N2, B/Victoria, or B/Yamagata strains were diluted in Opti-MEM (Thermo Fisher, Cat #31985062) and directly added to a HEK-293T (CRL-3216, ATCC) cell monolayer at four RNA dose levels (62.5, 31.1, 15.6, and 7.8 ng/well). The input amount of mRNA encoding the strain-specific HA was the same between modRNA formulations (e.g., different amounts of mIRV and qIRV were applied to cells to achieve a final concentration of 62.5 ng/well of mRNA encoding the B/Phuket/3073/2013 HA). Opti-MEM media alone was used as a negative control. Protein expression was measured with a flow cytometer (BD FACS Fortessa) using in-house generated rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against each of the following strains: A/Wisconsin/588/2019 (H1N1), A/Darwin/6/2021 (H3N2), B/Austria/1359417/2021 (B/Victoria), or B/Phuket/3073/2013 (B/Yamagata), followed by a secondary anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to Alexa-Fluor 488 (Invitrogen, Cat # A-11008). The percentage of live cells expressing the strain-specific HA protein was enumerated and expression was measured by quantifying the number of live cells that had a positive signal for bound anti-HA antibody.AnimalsMouse immunogenicity studies utilized female BALB/c mice (The Jackson Laboratory) that were first immunized between 7-13 weeks of age. NHP immunization studies utilized female rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) and cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fasicularis) from the Pfizer colony at Pearl River, NY that were co-housed in standard quad caging. Rhesus and cynomolgus macaques were immunized at 5.5 and 13.5–15.5 years of age, respectively. Animal studies were performed at Pfizer, Pearl River, NY, which is accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC).For mIRV and qIRV toxicology studies, male and female Wistar Han rats, 11 weeks of age at the dosing study start, were supplied by Charles River Laboratories. Toxicology studies were conducted at Pfizer, Groton, CT according to GLP and OECD guidelines. Animals were offered Certified Irradiated Rodent Diet 2916 C (Envigo Teklad Global Diet) and locally sourced water ad libitum, except when fasting was conducted prior to clinical pathology collections or euthanasia. Animals were socially housed throughout the study in ventilated Tecniplast double decker polyphenylsulfone cages with Enrich-n’Pure® (The AndersonsP, Inc.). Environmental conditions across studies were set to maintain relative humidity ranging from 30% to 70% and temperature ranging from 68 °F to 79 °F with room lighting set to provide a 12-h light/dark cycle.All procedures performed on animals were in accordance with regulations and established guidelines and were reviewed and approved by an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.Mouse immunization study designExperimental vaccine groups each contained 10 female BALB/c mice. Control groups consisted of 5 or 10 female BALB/c mice that were administered 50 µL of saline intramuscularly (IM). For all studies, mice were immunized IM twice, on Days 0 and 28. Groups receiving modRNA-HA vaccines received 0.2 µg of each mRNA HA construct. Thus, mIRV vaccines were administered at a 0.2 µg dose in a 50 µL volume; tIRV was administered at a 0.6 µg dose (0.2 µg/HA) in a 50 µL volume; and qIRV vaccines were administered at a 0.8 µg dose (0.2 µg /HA) in a 50 µL volume. An undiluted comparator QIV (Fluad®) was administered IM at a final concentration of 2.4 µg in a 20 µL dose volume (1/25th of the human dose), also on Days 0 and 28. Whole blood was collected on Day 21 (3 weeks post-dose 1) and Day 42 (2 weeks post-dose 2) and evaluated for levels of functional anti-HA antibodies by serology. Splenocytes were isolated on Day 42 (study end) to measure the T cell-mediated immune response following immunization.NHP immunization study designRhesus and cynomolgus macaques (3 animals/group) were each immunized IM with a 30 µg dose of mIRV (A/Wisconsin/588/2019) in a 0.5 mL total volume. Whole blood was collected on Days -7 (pre-vaccination), 7, 21, 28, 35, 42, 77, 105, 133, and 168 and evaluated for levels of functional anti-HA antibodies by serology. PBMCs were isolated on Days -7 (pre-vaccination), 7, 35, 42, 77, 105, 133 and 168 to measure T cell responses following immunization.Toxicology study designFor both toxicology studies, male and female Wistar Han rats (15/sex/group) were randomly assigned to Groups 1 or 2, and doses were administered IM by 2 separate injections on Days 1 and 15. Group 1 was administered sterile saline. Group 2 was administered with either 34 µg mIRV or 30 µg qIRV (7.5 µg/HA). A subset of animals (10/sex/group) was euthanized 2 days after the second dose (Day 17), while the remaining animals (5/sex/group) underwent an approximate 3-week recovery and then were euthanized (Day 38–39). Serum samples were collected from each animal prior to dose initiation and on Day 17 (dosing phase) and Day 21 (recovery phase) for analysis of hemagglutination inhibition, to confirm in parallel functional immunogenicity of the mIRV and qIRV under toxicological observation.Samples for clinical pathology analysis in toxicology studies (hematology, coagulation, clinical chemistry, acute phase proteins and urinalysis) were collected on Days 3 (nonterminal; hematology, clinical chemistry, and acute phase proteins A1AGP and A2M only), 17 (terminal), and 39 (terminal), from overnight fasted animals. For non-terminal collections, hematology was assessed in the first 7 animals/sex/group and clinical chemistry was assessed in the last 8 animals/sex/group. Phlebotomy sites included the jugular vein (non-terminal bleed) or aorta under isoflurane anesthesia followed by exsanguination (terminal bleed). Blood samples were collected into appropriate tubes (K2EDTA for hematology, 3.2% sodium citrate for coagulation, serum separator for clinical chemistry and acute phase proteins).Animal blood collection and splenocyte isolationFor mouse immunization studies, the interim bleed was conducted using a submandibular bleeding technique. At the study end, blood was collected via cardiac puncture (terminal bleed). Whole blood tubes remained at room temperature (RT) for at least 30 min prior to centrifuging at 10,000 RPM for 3 min for sera collection. Samples for HAI and MNT assays were treated using a receptor destroying enzyme (RDE) kit (Accurate Chemical), heat inactivated and pre-adsorbed with turkey red blood cells (RBCs). Samples were stored at −80 °C until testing. At the study end, spleens were collected from 5 mice per group and separately placed in a 70 µm cell strainer (Fisher) immersed in 7 mL of complete RPMI (cRPMI: 10% FBS/RPMI; Pen-Strep; Sodium pyruvate; HEPES; MEM-NEAA; Amphotericin B) per well of a 6-well plate. Plates were maintained on ice during transit and before processing for single cell suspension. Spleens were homogenized, subjected to RBC lysis, and passed through a cell strainer to remove RBCs and clumps.For NHP immunization studies, blood for serum and PBMC isolation was collected in BD Vacutainer® SST™ tubes and K2 EDTA 5.4 mg tubes, respectively, while animals were safely restrained. Whole blood samples were centrifuged at 3000 RPM for 10 min and sera were collected and stored at −80 °C until testing. Blood for PBMC isolation were retained at RT until processed. Diluted whole blood was layered on 90% Ficoll (GE Healthcare) to isolate PBMCs via density gradient centrifugation at 800 × g. PBMCs were then frozen in Gibco Recovery™ Cell Culture Freezing Medium at 5 × 106 cells/vial and stored in liquid nitrogen until analysis.VirusesAll viruses used for testing were rescued using a reverse genetics system similar to one previously described54. In brief, an eight-plasmid system was applied for virus rescue. Each bidirectional plasmid encoded one of the eight segmented genes of influenza virus. The sequences for HA and NA genes were strain-specific and the six influenza backbone genes were subtype-specific (IAV or IBV). For IAV, sequences for the backbone genes of PA, PB2, NP, NS, and M were from the A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) (PR8) strain while PB1 sequence was from the A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) strain. For IBV, all six backbone genes were from B/Brisbane/60/2008 (B/Vic). The pool of 2 µg of each plasmid in OptiMEM medium (Gibco # 31985) was co-transfected into a co-culture of HEK-293T and MDCK cells (1:1 ratio) with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) for 4 h at 37 °C followed by replacement of media with OptiMEM supplemented with 1 µg/mL of TPCK-treated trypsin. The viruses were harvested at 72-h post-transfection and propagated twice in MDCK cells with multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.001–0.01 for passage 1 and MOI of 0.0001–0.001 for passage 2. Passage 1 viruses served as virus seeds and passage 2 viruses served as viral stocks for HAI and MNT assay testing, described below.Hemagglutination inhibition assay (HAI)modRNA-HA vaccine-induced functional anti-HA antibodies that prevent HA-mediated agglutination of RBCs were measured using the hemagglutination inhibition assay (HAI). All sera were pre-treated with RDE, heat-inactivated, and then pre-adsorbed with appropriate RBCs to remove any non-specific agglutinins. 2-fold serial dilutions of mouse or NHP sera, tested in duplicate, in PBS were mixed with the vaccine matched influenza virus strain on a shaker for 5 min then left to incubate for 30 min at RT. The neutralization reaction was then mixed with either turkey or guinea pig RBCs (Lampire Biological Laboratories) and incubated an additional 30 or 60 min, respectively, at RT. Assay plates were imaged on a FluHema (SciRobotics). The HAI titer was reported as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution resulting in loss of HA activity, visualized as a full smear reaching the bottom of the well with substantial footing when the microtiter plate was tilted 60° for 30 s, when using turkey RBCs. If guinea pig RBCs were used, loss of HA activity was observed as a pellet on the microtiter plate without tilting. All samples were run in duplicate.For the toxicity studies, the HAI assay was conducted by VisMederi (Siena, Italy). In the VisMederi HAI assay, sera collected from mIRV and qIRV immunized rats were pre-treated with RDE, heat-inactivated and then pre-adsorbed with appropriate RBCs to remove any non-specific agglutinins. The treated serum, tested in duplicate per sample, was serially titrated two-fold in a dilution plate starting at a 1:10 dilution. An equal volume of standardized influenza antigen, obtained from Francis Crick Institute (London, UK) and propagated by VisMederi Research (Siena, Italy), was added to the serum samples and the plates were incubated 60 min at RT. RBCs were then added to all wells, and plates were incubated further for 60 min at RT. Following the last incubation, the plates were tilted, and the titer was determined as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution in which agglutination was still completely inhibited. The geometric mean of four titers per sample (two analysts + two readers) was reported for each influenza vaccine antigen.Microneutralization test (MNT)Anti-HA neutralizing antibody responses following vaccination were measured using a 1-day microneutralization assay (MNT). Sera were pre-treated with RDE and heat-activated prior to use in the MNT assay. Serial dilutions of either mouse or NHP sera were incubated in a flat bottom 96-well plate with the vaccine matched influenza virus strain for 1 h at 37 °C/5% CO2. Adherent MDCK cells (MDCK NBL-2, ATCC CCL-34) were added in suspension on top of the neutralization reaction and incubated at 37 °C/5% CO2 for 18–20 h. Cells were then fixed with methanol and stained with either Polyclonal Rabbit IgG Anti-Influenza A NP or Anti-Influenza B NP (Invitrogen) primary antibody followed by AlexaFluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG H + L (Life Technologies) secondary antibody. Infected cells were counted using a CTL ImmunoSpot S6 Universal-V Analyzer with ImmunoCapture Software (Cellular Technology Ltd). MNT titers were reported as the reciprocal of the dilution that resulted in 50% reduction in infection when compared to a no serum control. All samples were run in duplicate.Intracellular cytokine staining assayVaccine-induced T cell responses to influenza were measured by flow cytometry-based intracellular cytokine staining assay (ICS). In mouse studies, freshly-isolated splenocytes (2 × 106 cells/well) were cultured in cRPMI with media containing DMSO only (unstimulated) or a specific peptide pool representing HA sequences of the A/Wisconsin/588/2019 (H1N1) influenza virus strain (Mimotopes) for 5 h at 37 °C in the presence of protein transport inhibitors, GolgiPlug and GolgiStop. Following stimulation, cells were stained for surface and intracellular markers to identify activated and/or cytokine-expressing T cell types (CD3+ cells for CD4 vs CD8), activation markers (CD154/CD40L), and cytokines (IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-4, TNF-α, CD154, and CD107a). The eBioscience™ fixable viability dye eFluor 506 (Invitrogen) was used prior to surface staining, per manufacturer’s instructions, to exclude dead cells. After staining, the cells were washed and resuspended in flow cytometry buffer (2% FBS/PBS). Cells were acquired on a BD LSR Fortessa and data were analyzed using BD FlowJo™ software. Results are background (media - DMSO) subtracted and shown as a percentage of CD4+ T cells or CD8+ T cells.In NHP studies, the ex vivo stimulation with HA peptides was performed as described above, using PBMCs collected at different timepoints in place of splenocytes. Frozen PBMCs were thawed and rested for the ICS assay. Following stimulation, PBMCs were stained for surface and intracellular markers to identify IFN-γ-expressing T cells for both species (rhesus and cynomolgus macaques). Acquired data were analyzed as described above. The T cell gating strategy used for all species is shown in Supplementary Fig. 6A, B.Toxicology observations and measurementsFor in-life assessments, during the Dosing Phase all animals were weighed twice prior to the initiation of dosing (PID) on Days 1 and 7, prior to dosing on Days 1 and 15, and on non-dosing Days 4, 8, and 11, and a fasted weight was collected just prior to scheduled necropsy. Body weights were collected on Recovery Phase Days 1, 8, 15, and 21. Clinical observations occurred at least once daily prior to the initiation of dosing, at least twice daily on non-dosing days and during the recovery phase, and prior to and after each dose on dosing days. Body temperatures were collected on all animals on Dosing Phase Days 1 and 15 prior to dosing and at approximately 4- and 24-h post-dose. Injection sites were observed on Dosing Phase Days 1 and 15 prior to dosing and approximately 4- and 24-h post-dose on all animals.Hematology was evaluated using a Siemens Advia 2120i analyzer (Siemens Healthineers Tarrytown, NY, USA). Fibrinogen activated partial thromboplastin time, and prothrombin time was evaluated on the Diagnostic Stago STA-R evaluation coagulation analyzer (Diagnostic Stago, Parsippany, NJ, USA). Blood smears were prepared for the first 7 animals on Day 3 and all animals on Day 17 and Day 39. Blood cell morphology was evaluated microscopically on 5 animals of each sex from all groups at both scheduled necropsies (i.e., at dosing and recovery phases). Routine clinical chemistry parameters were evaluated using a Siemens Advia 1800 clinical chemistry analyzer (Siemens Healthineers, Tarrytown, NY, USA). Acute phase proteins alpha-2 macroglobulin (A2M) and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (A1AGP) were measured using the rat MSD Acute Phase Protein Panel 1 on the MSD SECTOR S 600 Analyzer (Meso Scale Design). Routine urinalysis parameters were measured, and a microscopic examination of sediment for formed elements was performed on 5 animals of each sex from all dose groups at both scheduled necropsies (i.e., dosing and recovery phases).For post-mortem analysis, complete necropsies, tissue collection, organ weights, and macroscopic tissue evaluation were performed on all animals. Animals were euthanized by gas anesthesia (isoflurane) followed by exsanguination on Dosing Phase Day 17 (2 days after the last dose) or on Recovery Phase Day 22, the last day of the Recovery Phase (surviving animals). Necropsy, tissue collection, organ weights, macroscopic tissue evaluation, and microscopic examination were performed. Anatomic pathology analysis was completed at Pfizer DSRD, Groton, CT, and microscopic examination and peer review were completed at Pfizer DSRD, Pearl River, NY.Statistical analysisAnimal immunogenicity data was analyzed using GraphPad PRISM software. GMTs of the immune responses for vaccine groups and strains were calculated and are displayed in each bar chart. An independent two sample t-test was performed to compare immune responses of two groups between mIRV or qIRV and QIV (Fluad®). An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted to compare immune responses among mIRV, tIRV, qIRV, and QIV (Fluad®). All pairwise comparisons of the four groups were performed and Tukey’s test was applied to adjust for multiple comparisons. All tests were two-tailed. A p value less than 0.01 was considered statistically significant and is marked with asterisk(s) in the bar charts.Statistical analysis of body weight, body weight change, food consumption, and body temperature were conducted. Descriptive statistics were generated for each parameter and group at each scheduled sampling time or each time interval. Analysis of body temperature was based on the maximum body temperature post injection for each animal. A nonparametric (rank-transform) one-way ANOVA was conducted, with a 2-sided pairwise comparison of each dose group to the reference group (saline control) using Dunnett’s test. Average ranks were assigned to ties. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant and is marked with asterisk(s) in the bar charts.

Overview RESP-NET is made up of three networks that monitor laboratory-confirmed hospitalizations associated with influenza (FluSurv-NET), COVID-19 (COVID-NET), and RSV (RSV-NET). RESP-NET Interactive Dashboard The rates presented on the RESP-NET interactive dashboard can be used to follow trends and comparisons of influenza, COVID-19, and RSV-associated hospitalizations in different demographic groups and over time. How to use the RESP-NET interactive dashboard‎ 1. Select a topic of interestTo use the RESP-NET interactive dashboard, select a topic to see specific data trends. Topics include rates by season, site, age group, sex, or race and ethnicity. Hospitalizations can be viewed as weekly, monthly, or cumulative rates. 2. Select a filter of interestTopics of interest can be filtered by season, site, age group, sex, and race and ethnicity. Filters vary by topic, as not all topics have filters available.3. Select other ways to viewThe data can be displayed in a graph or as a table. Right click anywhere in the graph for a tabular view. Hovering your mouse over or selecting a data point or bar in the graph will display detailed information. Some graphs allow you to hide or show data from the legend for detailed analysis. This dashboard is updated weekly. Data are preliminary and subject to change as more data become available. Rates for recent hospital admissions are subject to reporting delays that might increase around holidays or during periods of increased hospital utilization. As new data are received each week, previous rates are updated accordingly. Why RESP-NET data are important COVID-19, RSV, and influenza-associated hospitalization rates are used to understand trends in virus circulation, estimate disease burden, and respond to outbreaks. Demographic and detailed clinical information, including underlying conditions, allow CDC to better understand hospitalization trends and determine who is most at risk. Key Concept‎ Population-based surveillance is the active collection, analysis, and interpretation of data on a population in a specified geographic area. RESP-NET does not collect data on all hospitalizations caused by respiratory illnesses, but it can describe hospitalizations caused by three viruses that account for a large proportion of these hospitalizations. Surveillance is conducted through a network of acute care hospitals in select counties or county equivalents in: 14 states for influenza surveillance. 13 states for COVID-19 surveillance. 13 states for RSV surveillance. These surveillance platforms cover more than 30 million people and include an estimated 10% of the U.S. population. The surveillance platforms for these viruses are FluSurv-NET, COVID-NET, and RSV-NET. Rates presented on the RESP-NET interactive dashboard can be used to follow trends and compare COVID-19, influenza, and RSV-associated hospitalization rates in different demographic groups. This includes data by age, sex, and race and ethnicity, and across seasons and states. Surveillance in RESP-NET for these viruses relies on clinical testing ordered by a healthcare provider. Hospitalization rates are unadjusted and do not account for undertesting, differing provider or facility testing practices, and diagnostic test sensitivity. The true burden of hospitalizations associated with these viruses in the United States may be greater than what is shown by these numbers.

Currently, five genetic lineages of IDV have been described, but their evolutionary dynamics have not been studied. Although IDV was first identified in 2011, our comprehensive analysis of all known IDV genomes suggests that the earliest ancestors of IDV likely to have evolved towards the end of the 20th century and D/OK lineage appears to have emerged in 2005. We confirmed a significantly higher substitution rate in IDV than in Influenza C virus, which is consistent with their global distribution and multi-host tropism. We identified multiple sub-populations within the D/OK lineage, highlighting extensive diversification and dissemination. Other findings are evidence for potential reassortment among IDV strains in the USA and transboundary circulation of IDV in Europe with introductions into Danish cattle, some of which potentially originated from France. IDV, an emerging virus with a higher rate of evolution and uncontrolled circulation, could facilitate its adaptation to humans. Our findings underscore the importance of targeted surveillance for IDV in humans and at-risk animal populations.

Since 2011, IDV has been detected in cattle3,4, pigs5, goats6, giraffe and wildebeest7; IDV-seropositivity was confirmed in multiple species including sheep8, horses9, camels10 and white-tailed deer11. IDV has been reported from various countries including, France3, Mexico4, Italy5, Japan12, China6,13, Ireland14, U.K15, Canada16, Denmark17, Luxembourg18, South Korea19, Turkey20, Australia21 and Namibia7, Morocco, Togo, Benin, Kenya10, and Ethiopia22. Cattle serves as the primary reservoir host for IDV and has been implicated with Bovine Respiratory Disease Complex (BRDC). IDV was found in co-infections with other respiratory viruses, including Influenza C virus (ICV), Bovine Herpesvirus type 1 (BHV-1), Bovine Respiratory Syncytial Virus (BRSV), Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus types 1 and 2 (BVDV1 and BVDV2), Bovine Parainfluenza Virus 3 (BPIV3) and Bovine Coronavirus (BCoV) in cattle with BRDC4,23,24. Both serological evidence of IDV exposure and IDV genome detection in nasal cavities of humans25,26,27,28 indicate the zoonotic potential and possible animal to human transmission of IDV. The IDV replication and productive infection was also confirmed in differentiated human airway epithelial cell culture29.IDV genome consists of seven negative-sense single-stranded RNA segments that share ~ 50% amino acid identity with ICV, another member of Orthomyxoviridae family (Gammainfluenzavirus genus)1. Similar to ICV, the hemagglutinin-esterase fusion (HEF) protein of IDV is primarily involved in receptor binding, determinant of antigenicity and the target for neutralizing antibodies. The polymerase complex of IDV consists of polymerase subunits PB2, PB1 and P3 which in combination with nucleoprotein (NP) and viral RNA (vRNA) forms the vRNPs; necessary for replication and transcription of the vRNA30,31. The P42 gene (segment six) encodes for M1 and DM2, of which the former aids in virus assembly and the latter is an ion channel protein that facilitates release of vRNP into the cytoplasm during the IDV entry32. The seventh segment (NS) leads to production of two non-structural proteins (NS1 and NS2) by alternate splicing30. NS1 counteracts host interferon response33. Recent studies have indicated the presence of three nuclear export signals (NES) in non-structural 2 (NS2) protein that aid in nuclear export activity (NEA) of IDV viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs) and position specific mutations in these NES can lead to loss of NEA activity of vRNPs34.Based on the divergence of the HEF nucleotide sequence, IDV is currently classified into five distinct lineages, namely, D/OK, D/660, D/Yama2016, D/Yama2019 and D/CA201935,36,37,38. The D/OK lineage has been isolated in Americas, Europe, Asia and Africa3,4,5,6,7,12,14,15,16,17,18, whereas, the D/660 lineage is found in Americas and Europe3,4,5,14,15,16,17,18. There has been evidence of multiple and frequent reassortment events amongst these two (D/OK and D/660) lineages16,35,39 and their widespread distribution may have been due to the extensive cattle trade. These frequent reassortment events have led to the emergence of multiple lineages in the last few years wherein two lineages of IDV (D/Yama2016 and D/Yama2019) have emerged in Japan37,38 that are distinct from those isolated in other countries. Of the two novel lineages identified in Japan, the D/Yama2019 has also been reported from China40, South Korea19 and Australia21. The highly antigenically diverse lineage (D/CA2019) was reported in California, USA, wherein the P3 gene of D/OK lineage reassorted with the genome segments of D/660 lineage and the anti-sera against D/CA2019 effectively recognized D/OK and D/660 lineages, thus exhibiting broader antigenicity36. A server based on alignment-free algorithm for typing of IDV isolates using sequences of HEF gene has been developed recently by our group and can be accessed online at https://bioinfo.unipune.ac.in/IDV/home.html41 .While IDV has been implicated in respiratory disease in cattle, it has not been recognized as clinically significant in cattle or any other species. Consequently, no routine testing is carried out anywhere in the world, raising concerns about the silent spread of this zoonotic virus and the risk of the emergence of novel variants. Studies showed a significant proportion (47.7 – 84.6%) of US cattle may be carrying IDV. Notably, multi-host viruses – in particular zoonotic viruses shared between humans and animals – have caused most recent infectious disease outbreaks in domestic animals42,43 and humans44,45. Therefore, it is critical to investigate the evolutionary dynamics and population stratification of IDV. Hence, we conducted a comprehensive evolutionary analysis and a segment-specific spatiotemporal clustering of all available IDV genome sequences to characterize their global emergence.ResultsThe gene-based datasets were compiled for IDV and are listed in Table 1. The nucleotide variations as well as the corresponding amino acid substitutions in every gene dataset were extracted. Recombination analysis of every dataset confirmed absence of recombination events.Table 1 IDV Genes and number of entries retrievedFull size tablePhylogeny and evolutionary dynamic analysisThe best fit Nucleotide Substitution Model (NSM) obtained for each dataset has been reported in Table 2. Maximum-Likelihood (ML) based phylogenetic trees were generated for all the aligned datasets. The ML tree of the HEF gene dataset was generated using TVM + F + G4 as the best-fit NSM (Fig. 1) and the bootstrap values supporting diversifying tree topology are displayed on the respective branches. The generated ML tree shows clustering of entries into 5 main lineages (D/OK, D/660, D/Yama2016, D/Yama2019 and D/CA2019). The D/OK lineage could be differentiated into the European, China and USA clusters. The isolates from Italy, UK, France, Luxembourg and Denmark belonged to the European cluster. The isolates from the USA formed multiple independent clusters whereas a single isolate from Mexico clustered with the USA isolates. Similarly, the Lineage D/660 comprised multiple clusters wherein isolates from USA formed independent clusters as well clustered with isolates from Canada, Mexico and few from Denmark. Most of the Denmark isolates are clustered with isolates from Italy. The remaining three clusters comprised of lineages D/Yama2016 (Japan), D/Yama2019 (Japan and China) and D/CA2019 (USA: California).Table 2 Gene-specific nucleotide substitution model (NSM), molecular clock, mean nucleotide substitution rate (NSR), NSR (95% HPD) and tMRCAFull size tableFig. 1: ML-based phylogenetic tree of HEF gene sequences.The lineages D/OK, D/660, D/Yama2016, D/Yama2019 and D/CA2019 are highlighted in , , , , and , respectively.Full size imageML-based trees of gene segments PB2, PB1, P3, NP, P42, NS, NS1 and NS2 indicated presence of multiple clusters wherein isolates of D/OK and D/660 lineage clustered together. This indicates absence of independent clusters of D/OK and D/660 lineage isolates as seen in the phylogenetic tree of HEF gene. Also, the PB2, NP, P42 and NS2 of D/CA2019 lineage clustered with isolates of D/660; whereas PB1, P3, NS and NS1 of D/CA2019 isolates clustered with isolates of D/OK lineage (Supplementary Fig. 1 (a-h)).Evolutionary analysis of all the coding segments of IDV was carried out and the results of nucleotide substitution model and molecular clock are indicated in Table 2. Positive correlation between root-to-tip distance and time of isolation for all segments indicated presence of molecular clock behavior. The mean NSR for all the segments was calculated using constant growth model and it was found to be in the range of 1.16 × 10−3 (PB1)–1.66 × 10−3 (HEF) substitutions per site per year (subs/site/year) and the time to Most Recent Common Ancestor (tMRCA) was in the range of 1997.04–2003.16 (Table 2).The Maximum Clade Credibility (MCC) tree derived using the HEF gene dataset (Fig. 2) helped to understand lineage specific evolution of IDV. The NSR for HEF gene of IDV was calculated to be 1.66 × 10−3 subs/site/year (95% HPD: 1.4047 × 10−3–2.0118 × 10−3) whereas the tMRCA was around 1996.09 (first week of February). The lineage D/OK was the earliest to be sampled around 2005.68 (first week of September) followed by D/660 (2008.25; first week of April), D/Yama2016 (2014.38; third week of May), D/Yama2019 (2017.18; first week of March) and D/CA2019 (2017.93; first week of December) (Table 3). The mean NSR was found to be highest for D/Yama2019 at 2.01 × 10−3 subs/site/year (95% HPD: 0.54–3.44 × 10−3) and least for D/Yama2016 at 1.79 × 10−3 subs/site/year (95% HPD: 0.52–3.26 × 10−3). PB1 gene was reported to have the lowest NSR amongst all the segments indicating higher constraints on its evolution.Fig. 2: MCC tree of IDV HEF dataset constructed using TVM + F + G4 model with Uncorrelated relaxed Clock Lognormal Distribution and constant growth model for MCMC run of 1 × 108.The lineages D/OK, D/660, D/Yama2016, D/Yama2019 and D/CA2019 are highlighted in , , , , and .Full size imageTable 3 Lineage-specific mean NSR, NSR (95% HPD) and tMRCA based on HEF sequencesFull size tableMutations and selection pressure analysisThe outcome of the selection pressure analysis of the respective genes is tabulated in Table 4. The cap-binding domain (CBD) (331 - 439 aa) of PB2 is involved in capture of 5’-methylated cap of host messenger RNA31. The residues 434 and 439 of CPD are found to be under positive selection; R434S substitution is seen in the IDV sequence (GenBank: OM763674) isolated from China (2021) which belongs to D/Yama2019 lineage whereas K439R/A substitution was found in Japanese isolates belonging to the 2 Japanese lineages (D/Yama2016 and D/Yama2019). The positive selection sites in PB1 are part of the N-terminal (5 aa) and C-terminal (663, 687 and 744 aa) domain. The PB1 residues K37, Y38, Y238, K239, R240 and W386 are involved in recognition of 5’-terminal vRNA31. The substitution A384E was found in isolates from Mexico (D/660), A384T found in few isolates from USA (D/OK and D/660) and Canada (D/660) and A384V found in four isolates from USA (D/660). Another substitution D388N which is in proximity to W386 was found in isolates from USA (D/660) and all 3 isolates belonging to D/CA2019 lineage isolated from USA. The substitution L553V which is in close proximity to anchoring residues (554 and 557) is found in a few isolates from USA (D/OK and D/660) and all 3 isolates from USA belonging to D/CA2019. The site L203S was found to be under positive selection in one isolate from Japan (D/Yama2016) and is part of the linker domain of P3.Table 4 Codon sites of IDV identified to be under positive selection using different methodsFull size tableThe numbering in the structure of HEF protein (PDB ID: 5e66) starts from the first amino acid whose corresponding position in sequence is 17 (assuming that mature protein forms after cleavage of 1st 16 residues that form signal peptide)46. The numbering mentioned henceforth for HEF is denoted as sequence position (structure position). The residues F143 (F127), W201 (W185), F245 (F229), Y247 (Y231) and F313 (F297) that are part of the secondary structures 170-loop, 190-loop, 230-helix, and 270-loop, respectively, constitute the receptor binding sites of IDV HEF30,46. Substitution A203D (A188D), observed in all the sequences from D/Yama2019 lineage (Japan and China) was in close proximity to W201(W185). The residues T255 (T239) and A289 (A273) are unable to form salt bridge interaction like the one seen in Influenza C virus (ICV) HEF sequence (K251 (K235) – D285 (D269))30,46. Substitutions A289S (A273S) was observed in all D/660 lineage isolates whereas A289V (A273V) substitution was found in most isolates from Europe of D/OK lineage (74/87 isolates). Residue 286 which is in close proximity is considered to be site under positive selection wherein multiple substitution were found (I286A/K/T); I286A was observed in two USA isolates (D/OK lineage, isolated in 2013), I286K in another two USA isolates (D/OK lineage, isolated in 2019) and I286T in six isolates from Europe and Japan (Italy–4, Denmark–1 of D/OK lineage; Japan–1 of D/Yama2016 lineage). Substitution T255A (T239A) was found only in isolates from D/Yama2016 lineage. The residue F256 which is adjacent to T255, undergoes positive selection (F256L) in 47/49 isolates of D/660 lineage. The IDV HEF consists of five glycosylation sites N28 (N12), N249 (N233), N346 (N330), N513 (HEF2: N58) and N562 (HEF2: N107)30. Substitution N249S (N233S) results in the loss of one N-linked glycosylated site in isolates from Japan of D/Yama2016 lineage.The NS2 segment consists of three NESs namely, NES1: 66LRNQLTALRI75, NES2: 97LLLPLMRNLEM107 and NES3: 136LVSLIRLKSKL14634. The residues L70, L73 and I75 from NES1 were critical for nuclear export activity (NEA). Substitutions T71I (11 Italy isolates, D/OK lineage), A72T (four USA isolates, D/660 lineage) and R74K (12 Denmark isolates, D/OK lineage) were observed in NES1.Population stratification based on HEF genePopulation stratification studies based on the HEF gene enable us to elucidate the genetic diversity and geographic distribution of IDV, facilitating the identification of distinct lineages and sub-populations within the viral population. A total of 354 Pi sites were identified in the dataset containing 146 sequences (Dataset_4_unique) with low linkage disequilibrium (ISA = 0.0756) which justifies the use of the STRUCTURE program to infer the genetic diversity of the population. The optimal peak (Kopt) was obtained at K = 2 followed by two minor peaks at K = 5 and 8 (Fig. 3).Fig. 3: The plot of K versus ΔK to determine the optimum number of clusters present in global isolates of IDV based on the HEF gene.‘K’ represents the number of clusters. ‘ΔK’ represents the rate of change of posterior probability of the data given K. The optimum number of clusters (Kopt) for 146 global IDV isolates based on HEF-gene sequences is determined from the plot. A major peak for ΔK at K = 2 (D/OK and D/660 form 2 major clusters) and two minor peaks at K = 5 and 8 were observed.Full size imageA varying degree of admixture was present in isolates belonging to every cluster and based on the major membership score (≥ 0.8) the isolates of a lineage were identified to be a member of specific cluster. At K = 2 (Supplementary Fig. 2a), two major clusters (C1 and C2) were observed wherein C1 constituted of isolates from D/OK lineage and isolates of D/660 lineage formed C2. The isolates from D/Yama2016, D/Yama2019 and D/CA2019 were found to be admixed between C1 and C2. At K = 5 (G1-G5) (Supplementary Fig. 2b), isolates from lineage D/OK belonged to G1 (29 isolates - USA and China) and G4 (61 isolates - Italy, France, UK, Denmark and Luxembourg), isolates from lineage D/660 belonged to G2 (40 isolates -USA, Mexico, Italy, Canada and Denmark), the isolates of lineages D/Yama2016 and D/CA2019 formed the cluster G3 (four isolates from Japan and 3 isolates from USA) and lineage D/Yama2019 isolates formed G5 (two isolates each from Japan and China). Peak at K = 8 (Supplementary Fig. 2c) further stratified the isolates into 8 populations (P1-P8) wherein isolates from lineage D/OK differentiated into 4 populations namely, P4: USA (18 isolates); P5: Italy, France, UK, Denmark, and Luxembourg (61 isolates); P6: USA (2 isolates); P7: China (9 isolates). All the 40 isolates of lineage D/660 isolates formed a single population (P8: USA, Mexico, Italy, Canada and Denmark). Lineages D/Yama2016 (four isolates), D/Yama2019 (four isolates) and D/CA2019 (three isolates) formed three individual population groups P1, P3 and P2 respectively. A single isolate of D/660 lineage was observed to have mixed ancestry amongst D/OK and D/660 lineage and five isolates (from USA) of D/OK lineage had ancestry to two different clusters of D/OK lineage.As lineage D/OK forms four different populations, stratification studies of D/OK lineage were carried out separately. A total of 158 Pi was identified for 94 sequences (Dataset_4.1) and Pi site analysis revealed low linkage disequilibrium (ISA = 0.0623). The optimal peak (Kopt) was obtained at K = 2 followed by two minor peaks at K = 4 and 7 (Fig. 4).Fig. 4: The plot of K versus ΔK to determine the optimum number of clusters present in global isolates of IDV belonging to the D/OK lineage based on the HEF gene.‘K’ represents the number of clusters. ‘ΔK’ represents the rate of change of posterior probability of the data given K. The optimum number of clusters (Kopt) for 94 global IDV isolates of D/OK lineage based on HEF-gene sequences is determined from the plot. A major peak for ΔK at K = 2 and two minor peaks at K = 4 and 7 were observed.Full size imageBased on the major membership score (≥0.8) the isolates of a D/OK lineage were identified to be a member of a specific cluster. At major peak K = 2, two clusters (K1 and K2) were observed, wherein, cluster K1 comprised isolates from USA and China whereas K2 cluster comprised isolates from Italy, France, UK, Denmark and Luxembourg. At the first minor peak (K = 4), cluster M1 comprises isolates from Italy, France, UK, Denmark and Luxembourg. Isolates from China formed cluster M2 whereas isolates from the USA diverged into two clusters (M3 and M4). A further stratification is indicated by another peak at K = 7 (N1-N7) (Supplementary Fig. 3), wherein, isolates from Denmark form N2, USA isolates diverge into 3 clusters (N1, N5 and N7), whereas isolates from China form N3 cluster. N4 cluster comprises of isolates from UK, Italy, Luxembourg and N6 comprises isolates from Denmark, France and Italy.DiscussionIDV is novel and possibly zoonotic cattle flu virus that is known to infect a wide range of animals. Since its initial discovery in Oklahoma, USA, IDV has been prevalent in numerous countries worldwide3,4,5,6,7,10,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,22. Though cattle are considered as the primary host of IDV, the virus is reported to infect other animals such as horses, pigs, camels and small ruminants. Recently antibodies against IDV were detected in farm workers in the USA25 and IDV was detected in humans from Malaysia using qRT-PCR28 indicating its zoonotic potential.Our analysis confirmed five distinct lineages of IDV circulating in different countries and multiple reassortments between IDV isolates of D/OK and D/660 lineages, as previously reported16,35,36,39.The D/OK and D/660 lineages were prevalent across multiple countries3,4,5,6,7,12,14,15,16,17,18 whereas the D/Yama2016 and D/Yama2019 lineages were considered to be circulating only in Japan37,38 until the detection of D/Yama2019 lineage in China in late 202140 from South Korea in 202219 and from Australia21 in 2023. The D/Yama2016 and D/Yama2019 lineages formed independent clusters within close proximity of each other (for all gene segments) indicating high similarity between the two lineages and a significant genetic and antigenic divergence from IDV circulating around the world12,37,47.Population stratification studies based on the HEF gene indicated the diversifying nature of IDV into multiple subpopulations. We identified 8 clusters, with D/OK isolates found in 4 clusters. Among these, 2 clusters included isolates from the USA, 1 from China, and 1 with isolates from Europe (Italy, France, UK, Denmark, and Luxembourg). On the other hand, D/660, D/Yama2016, D/Yama2019 and D/CA2019 separated into single independent clusters indicating the presence of conservation within the lineages. A further stratification study of only D/OK lineage provided a similar picture wherein 4 clusters (as earlier) were observed which later diversified into 7 clusters. The isolates from China continued to form a single cluster indicating conservation amongst them. A few isolates from Denmark clustered with UK, Italy and Luxembourg, a few with France and Italy and the rest of Denmark isolates formed an independent cluster. This indicates multiple introductions of IDV into Denmark cattle with one of the origins from France17. The three independent clusters of USA isolates indicate high variability amongst USA isolates which can arise due to reassortment events amongst D/OK, D/660 and D/CA2019 isolates. These reassortments can help in increased transmissibility and antigenic variation of virus and therefore, a more comprehensive classification of IDV, especially of D/OK lineage needs to be worked out.We found a much higher substitution rate in the IDV HEF gene (1.66×10−3 subs/site/year) than the earlier reports (1.37 × 10−3 to 1.54 × 10−3 subs/site/year)30,39,48,49. Notably, the substitution rate in IDV HEF is higher than the HEF of another closely related orthomyxovirus ICV (5.9×10−4 subs/site/year; 95% HPD: 5.33–6.46 × 10−4 subs/site/year)50. Notably, the IDV HEF substitution rate is lower than that of the surface glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA) of Influenza A virus (IAV)51,52,53 and Influenza B virus (IBV)54. These observations are consistent with the broader host tropism and circulation of IDV compared to ICV. The higher substitution rate in IDV also explains genetic variability among the novel IDV lineages, D/CA2019, D/Yama2016 and D/Yama2019.The isolates of D/Yama2019 lineage from China might have evolved from the D/Yama2019 isolate/s from Hokkaido, Japan (2020), as this isolate (Accession ID: LC565478) is observed to be an intermediate between the D/Yama2019 isolates from Japan (2019) and the isolates from China (2021). The decrease in the NSR of D/Yama2019 HEF from 2.3 × 10−3 (Japan, 2019) to 1.5 × 10−3 (China, 2021) subs/site/year might suggest the stabilization of the virus in Chinese cattle. Similarly, circulation of D/OK lineage in China was observed between 2014–2018 but isolates from 2021 clustered with D/Yama2019 lineage40 which might be a result of decreasing NSR of D/OK (China) from 2 × 10−3 to 1.3 × 10−3 subs/site/year and a slightly higher NSR (1.5 × 10−3 subs/site/year) of D/Yama2019 (China). The tMRCA of IDV HEF indicated that the earliest ancestors of IDV might have evolved towards the end of the 20th century but the emergence of D/OK lineage might have been around 1st week of September 2005 (2005.68) whereas that of D/660 lineage was around 1st week of April 2008 which is earlier than previously reported48,49. The D/Yama2019 emerged in Japan during the circulation of the D/Yama2016 lineage and since then has been in circulation in Japan and spread to China indicating the adaption of the D/Yama2019 lineage. These findings offer crucial insights into the evolutionary dynamics and potential transmission pathways of IDV lineages between Japan and China, highlighting the importance of ongoing surveillance and research efforts in understanding the spread and adaptation of this emerging virus.Recognition of vRNA is an important precursor in the replication process which is facilitated by the binding of the 3’ and 5’ terminus of vRNA to residues within the P3 and PB1 subunits31. We found a substitution of A384V in USA isolates of both D/OK and D/660 lineages D/OK isolates from China. We also found D388N and L553V substitutions in all the IDV isolates of D/CA2019 lineage. These substitutions are in close proximity to W386 and Q554 involved in interaction with the bases of vRNA necessary for its stabilization and can thus affect the vRNA recognition by polymerases.The five residues of HEF (F143, W201, F245, Y247 and F313) are involved in receptor binding whereas two of the positive selected amino acid residues (F256 and I286) are present in the globular head. Alanine 203 (close proximity of W201) was substituted by a larger Aspartic acid in all the D/Yama2019 lineages and may affect the receptor binding interaction of W201. Similarly, the loss of salt-bridge in HEF of IDV as compared to the one reported in ICV HEF (residues T255 and A289) implies the formation of an open channel potentially contributing to the altered host tropism for IDV30,46.We also found several mutations in the HEF protein that may affect the receptor binding tropism of IDV. The substitution of T255 with a smaller amino acid such as Alanine was observed in D/Yama2016 isolates and a positively selected site F256, which undergoes substitution to replace Phenylalanine with smaller size Leucine in D/660 isolates. As reported earlier48, substitution of A289 by larger amino acids like Threonine, Serine and Valine might lead to formation of hydrogen bonds with T255. Replacement of Isoleucine with smaller residues like Alanine and Threonine at positively selected site I286 might also provide the structure with increased flexibility whereas the substitution of Alanine with Lysine might decrease the structural flexibility due to its longer side chain. The access of HEF to its receptor might be limited due to the glycosylation site N249 but a deletion might help the virus acquire broader cell tropism as seen in case of H5N1 of IAV30,55. Substitution N249S in D/Yama2016 isolates results in the glycosylation site. These substitutions might therefore lead to regulation of receptor binding affinity of IDV HEF by narrowing the open channel whereas substitutions at 249 and 255 might open up the HEF channel in D/Yama2016 isolates.The NS2 protein plays a crucial role in nucleocytoplasmic transport of vRNPs for IDV packaging34. Three NES regions (NES1, NES2, and NES3) are essential for nuclear export activity (NEA), with critical residues including L70, L73, I75 in NES1, and L98 in NES2. Substitutions at T71 (Italy), A72 (USA), and R74 (Denmark) may affect NEA of IDV NS2 and potentially impact viral fitness and adaptation mechanisms.Although serological and qPCR evidence supports the potential for IDV infection in humans, complete viral sequences have not been identified in these cases, nor has replication competent IDV been isolated from such samples56. Our study delves into the evolutionary dynamics and population stratification of IDV; future research could explore the mechanisms underlying interspecies transmission and the zoonotic potential of this novel virus. Investigating the factors driving the higher substitution rate in IDV HEF compared to other orthomyxoviruses and the implications of these substitutions for viral fitness and host tropism represents an intriguing area for exploration. Additionally, elucidating the role of specific mutations in the receptor binding affinity of IDV HEF could provide valuable insights into viral pathogenesis and transmission dynamics. The rapid evolution of IDV, characterized by multiple reassortments and lineage diversification, underscores the urgency for further research and vigilance in monitoring its spread and potential zoonotic transmission.Materials and methodsData curation and recombination analysisThe coding sequences of the reference entries of the 7 gene segments for IDV (PB2: NC_036616.1, PB1: NC_0.6615.1, P3: NC_036619.1, HEF: NC_036618.1, NP: NC_036617.1, P42: NC_036620.1 and NS: NC_036621.1) were obtained from NCBI GenBank and were individually used as query to perform BLAST searches against NCBI non-redundant nucleotide database. The results obtained were filtered to retain the sequences with query coverage of ≥90%. The set of sequences compiled for each query sequence representing 7 genes were downloaded from NCBI GenBank and saved independently as Dataset_1 to Dataset_7 (PB2 - NS). The GenBank accession IDs of entries constituting individual datasets (1 to 7) are available as Supplementary Data 1. As the NS gene undergoes alternative splicing to produce two products NS1 and NS2, the sequences for NS1 and NS2 were extracted from the NS dataset (Dataset_7) and saved Dataset_7.1 (NS1) and Dataset_7.2 (NS2). Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of each dataset was carried out using the MAFFT57 algorithm implemented in SEED 258 software. The aligned datasets were translated to their corresponding amino acid sequences and the variable (V) sites for each dataset were extracted using MEGAX59 software. Recombination detection analysis of each dataset was carried out in RDP560 software with a p-value cutoff of 0.005 and at least 3 methods providing positive prediction.Phylogeny and evolutionary dynamic analysis of IDV gene segmentsIQ-Tree webserver61 was used for identifying nucleotide substitution model (NSM) on the basis of Bayesian information criterion (BIC) and for generating Maximum-Likelihood (ML) based phylogenetic tree (1000 bootstrap replicates) using the NSM estimated for each dataset. The resultant trees were annotated using ITOL (Interactive Tree of Life) server62. Molecular clock behavior and root-to-tip distance for each dataset were evaluated in TempEst63 software.Lineage information was assigned to a total of 186/188 HEF gene entries based on published literature whereas remaining 2/188 entries (GenBank ID: MZ264979 and OM763677) were assigned lineage based on their clustering proximity in the phylogenetic tree.The best-fit NSM and Constant size growth model (demographic model) was used based on earlier studies49 to estimate the nucleotide substitution rates (NSR) for each dataset in BEAST v1.10.464. Marginal likelihood estimates were generated by Path Sampling (PS)/Stepping Stone (SS) analysis (implemented in BEAST v1.10.4) and used to calculate the Bayes Factor (BF) which was used to select the most favorable molecular clock model (strict clock, relaxed clock with lognormal distribution and relaxed clock with exponential distribution) for the dataset. A total of 108 simulation runs of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) were run with sampling at every 10,000 steps. Convergence was assessed using Tracer v1.765 and Figtree v1.4.4 (https://github.comambaut/figtreeeleases) was used to visualize the Maximum Clade Credibility (MCC) tree.Mutation and Selection pressure analysisSelection pressure analysis was carried out for the datasets (Dataset_1 to Dataset_6, Dataset_7.1 and 7.2) using FEL66 and MEME67 with a p-value cutoff set at 0.05. The FUBAR68 method was used with a posterior probability of 0.9. The variable and positively selected sites assessed for their functional implications.Population stratification studies based on HEF geneThe HEF dataset was filtered to only retain sequences with ≥ 99% query length compared to reference (NC_036618.1). CD-HIT69,70 standalone version was used to obtain a set of non-redundant sequences which were subsequently aligned using MAFFT57 available in SEED 258, which is designated as Dataset_4_unique. The leading and trailing gaps in Dataset_4_unique were trimmed and parsimoniously informative (Pi) sites along with lineage information were extracted using MEGAX59. LIAN71 package was used to calculate linkage disequilibrium with 10,000 replicates. Population stratification studies were carried out using the STRUCTURE72 program with previously described protocols73,74,75. Five sets of burnin and MCMC runs (20,000-100,000 with increments of 20,000) were used and STRUCTURE HARVESTER76 webserver, implementing Evanno’s method77 (numerical source data available as Supplementary Data 2 and 3), was used for choosing optimal clusters (Kopt).The D/OK lineage sequences were extracted from Dataset_4_unique, re-aligned using MAFFT57 (Dataset_4.1). The above-mentioned protocol of Pi site extraction and population stratification was also repeated to analyze Dataset_4.1.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.

Summary What CDC knows Each year, respiratory viruses are responsible for millions of illnesses and thousands of hospitalizations and deaths in the United States. Staying up to date with your recommended immunizations can reduce the risk of severe disease, hospitalization, and death. It is especially important for those at higher risk of severe illness from respiratory viruses to stay up to date on recommended immunizations. What CDC is doing CDC plays an important role in keeping people healthy by providing guidance on vaccines and making sure routine vaccines are available for everyone. CDC tracks how well vaccines work, and monitors disease spread to keep the public informed. During public health emergencies, CDC helps with quickly developing and distributing vaccines to control outbreaks. Its efforts ensure that everyone has access to vaccines, reducing illness and saving lives while building public trust in immunization. Recommended immunizations protect people and save lives During 2023-2024, CDC estimates: Flu vaccination prevented: At least 7 million influenza illnesses 3.7 million influenza-associated medical visits 105,000 influenza-associated hospitalizations 3,500 influenza-associated deaths in the United States COVID-19 vaccines: Reduced the risk of severe COVID-19 by about half. RSV immunizations: Reduced the risk of RSV-associated hospitalization by 75% among adults ages 60 years and older. Were 90% effective against RSV-associated hospitalization in infants during their first RSV season. Immunizations help your body defend itself against viruses Immunizations help prepare your body to defend itself from viruses and their potentially severe complications by strengthening your defenses. Most immunizations work by showing your body a harmless form or part of a virus. Your body will then make proteins called antibodies that will fight that virus if it encounters it again. Memory B cells will remember how to produce specific antibodies and T cells that can directly attack infected cells. Other immunizations work by directly providing you with antibodies. Once your immune system is prepared like this, it can quickly react to a virus before you become unwell. An immunized person is far less likely to die or become seriously ill than someone whose immune system is unprepared to fight an infection. Even with immunizations, you can still become infected. However, you are less likely to become infected, develop symptoms, become seriously ill or die compared with someone who has not been immunized. There may be side effects after vaccination The process of building an immune defense can cause some side effects. That is a normal part of the immune response and the side effects generally go away in a few days. Side effects can vary from person to person. Common side effects include: Pain, swelling, and redness on the arm where the shot was given Tiredness, headache, muscle pain Chills Nausea Fever People sometimes faint after medical procedures, including vaccination. If you feel dizzy, have vision changes, or ringing in your ears, tell your doctor. As with any medicine, there is a very remote chance of vaccination causing a severe allergic reaction, other serious injury, or death. Stay up to date on your recommended immunizations Flu CDC recommends everyone 6 months of age and older, with rare exceptions like having had a severe allergic reaction to flu vaccine in the past, receive an updated 2024-2025 flu vaccine to reduce the risk of influenza and its potentially serious complications. Ideally, everyone should be vaccinated by the end of October. Pregnant people can get the flu vaccine at any time during pregnancy, before and during the flu season. Early vaccination (like during July and August) can be considered for people who are in the third trimester because this can help provide protection to the infant during the first months of life when they are too young to be vaccinated. COVID-19 CDC recommends everyone ages 6 months and older receive an updated 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccine to protect against the potentially serious outcomes of COVID-19 whether or not they have ever previously been vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine. Pregnant people can help protect both themselves and their infants younger than 6 months old, who are too young to be vaccinated, from COVID-19 associated hospitalization by getting their COVID-19 vaccine. RSV Some older adults are eligible for RSV immunization. CDC recommends everyone ages 75 and older get an RSV vaccine, as well as adults ages 60 through 74 years who are at increased risk of severe RSV disease. If you have already gotten an RSV vaccine, you do not need to get another one at this time. CDC recommends all babies be protected from severe RSV by one of two immunization options, vaccination during pregnancy or infant immunization after birth. Most babies do not need both options. RSV vaccination during pregnancy involves giving an RSV vaccine (Pfizer's Abrysvo) to the pregnant person during weeks 32 through 36 of pregnancy. Maternal antibodies from this vaccine cross the placenta and can protect the baby for approximately 6 months after birth. RSV immunization involves giving an RSV antibody (nirsevimab) to babies or some toddlers. Nirsevimab should be given to babies shortly before the RSV season or within 1 week after birth if born shortly before or during the RSV season. Nirsevimab is given during October to March in most of the United States, but the timing of nirsevimab administration may differ in certain areas. Nirsevimab is also recommended for a small group of young children 8 through 19 months who are at increased risk for severe RSV. These children should receive nirsevimab shortly before the RSV season. This antibody protects against RSV and lasts at least five months. You can get your flu, COVID-19, and RSV vaccines at the same visit. View Larger Immunizations can protect against severe RSV. Use this chart to find out about RSV immunization eligibility, timing and more. There are considerations for people who are at higher risk for severe outcomes Some groups of people are at a higher risk for severe outcomes due to infection with respiratory viruses and may be recommended additional or higher dose vaccines. Flu People ages 65 years and older are recommended to use the higher dose flu vaccines (including high-dose inactivated and recombinant) or adjuvanted inactivated flu vaccine over standard-dose unadjuvanted flu vaccines. If none of these three vaccines is available at an opportunity for vaccine administration, then they can receive any other age-appropriate influenza vaccine. Children 6 months through 8 years of age who have not previously received 2 doses of flu vaccine or whose vaccination history is not known need 2 doses during a single respiratory virus season. COVID-19 Children ages 6 months to 4 years need more than one dose of COVID-19 vaccine, including at least one dose of the 2024-2025 vaccine, to be up to date. People who are moderately or severely immunocompromised and who have not received a COVID-19 vaccine before should get 2 or 3 doses of the same brand of updated COVID-19 vaccine. They also may be able to get additional doses. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) plans to meet on October 23 and 24, 2024 to review scientific data and vote on vaccine recommendations. There may be changes to the immunization recommendations for certain groups following this meeting. These meetings are open to the public and available online via live webcast.

Agoti1,5 Show authors Scientific Reports volume 14, Article number: 23426 (2024) Cite this article 437 Accesses 7 Altmetric Metrics details Subjects Molecular evolutionPhylogenetics AbstractThe patterns of spread of influenza A viruses in local populations in tropical and sub-tropical regions are unclear due to sparsity of representative spatiotemporal sequence data. We sequenced and analyzed 58 influenza A(H3N2) virus genomes sampled between December 2015 and December 2016 from nine health facilities within the Kilifi Health and Demographic Surveillance System (KHDSS), a predominantly rural region, covering approximately 891 km2 along the Kenyan coastline. The genomes were compared with 1571 contemporaneous global sequences from 75 countries. We observed at least five independent introductions of A(H3N2) viruses into the region during the one-year period, with the importations originating from Africa, Europe, and North America. We also inferred 23 virus location transition events between the nine facilities included in the study. International virus imports into the study area were captured at the facilities of Chasimba, Matsangoni, Mtondia, and Mavueni, while all four exports from the region were captured from the Chasimba facility, all occurring to Africa destinations. A strong spatial clustering of virus strains at all locations was observed associated with local evolution. Our study shows that influenza A(H3N2) virus epidemics in local populations appear to be characterized by limited introductions followed by significant local spread and evolution. Knowledge of the viral lineages that circulate within specific populations in understudied tropical and subtropical regions is required to understand the full diversity and global ecology of influenza viruses and to inform vaccination strategies within these populations.

However, the Yamagata lineage has not been detected since the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, raising speculation about its possible extinction5,6. The World Health Organization (WHO) and other public health agencies have not formally declared it extinct. These viruses belong to the family Orthomyxoviridae, which are enveloped, negative-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses with segmented genomes7. IAVs evolve rapidly and undergo immune driven selection through accumulation of amino acid changes, especially at antigenic sites of hemagglutinin (HA) glycoproteins8,9,10. These amino acid sequence drifts on HA are observed more frequently in A(H3N2) virus than A(H1N1)pdm09 virus11,12. Since 2009, antigenic drift of A(H3N2) viruses has resulted in emergence of several genetic groups (i.e., clades, subclades, and subgroups) globally, for example, clade 1–7 viruses13. Clade 3 viruses are the most genetically diverse and are divided into several genetic groups: subclades 3A, 3B, and 3C; and subgroups 3C.1, 3C.2, 3C.2a, 3C.3, and 3C.3a. We recently characterized A(H3N2) viruses that circulated in coastal Kenya between 2009 and 2017 and revealed co-circulation of multiple A(H3N2) virus genetic groups among hospitalized patients and outpatients5.While the global spread of seasonal influenza viruses has been studied intensively using phylogenetic and phylogeographic approaches14,15,16,17,18,19,20, their local patterns of spread remain less clear21, especially at city-wide or town scale. Although it is important to understand how diseases spread around the globe, local spread is most often the main driver of novel cases of respiratory diseases such as COVID-19 or influenza21. Transmission patterns have been recorded at different levels of human social clustering. Household studies have been performed to investigate person-to-person influenza transmission22. Studies of college campuses using phylogenetic methods have revealed extensive mixing of influenza virus strains among college students23. City-wide and countrywide, transmission of influenza in a season is characterized by majorly multiple virus introductions into cities21 and countries24,25,26; viruses then spread from multiple geographical locations to multiple geographical destinations following introduction24,25,26. However, there is a paucity of studies that describe the patterns of spread of influenza on a local scale (city or town) due to sparsity of representative spatiotemporal sequence data from defined sub-populations residing in the same geography within a country21,27. Knowledge of the viral lineages that circulate within specific localities in understudied tropical and subtropical regions is required to understand the full diversity and global ecology of influenza viruses in humans and to inform vaccination strategies within these regions.Given this gap in knowledge, we studied the patterns of spread of A(H3N2) virus in coastal Kenya using virus next generation sequencing (NGS) data collected over a one-year period between December 2015 and December 2016, along with 1571 global A(H3N2) virus sequence data from 75 countries to provide a phylogenetic context.Materials and methodsStudy designThe samples analysed in this study were collected from nine health facilities within the Kilifi Health and Demographic Surveillance System (KHDSS)28,29. The KHDSS, in Kilifi County, is a predominantly rural location along the Kenyan coastline covering an area of 891 km2; Fig. 1, Panel A. The KHDSS monitors a population of approximately 296,000 residents (2016 census) through household enumeration visits conducted every 4 months29. The KHDSS area has 21 public health facilities (including Kilifi County Hospital (KCH)) that receives outpatients and operates under the Kenya Ministry of Health. In total, nine of these facilities, spread throughout the KHDSS, were selected for this study: Matsangoni, Ngerenya, Mtondia, Sokoke, Mavueni, Jaribuni, Chasimba, Pingilikani, and Junju, Fig. 1, Panel A. Non-residents and residents of the KHDSS presenting to these facilities were included. A total of 5796 nasopharyngeal (NP) swab samples were taken from outpatients across all age groups presenting with acute respiratory illness (ARI), defined as patients presenting with symptoms of cough, sneezing, nasal congestion, difficulty breathing, or increased respiratory rate for age (as defined by the World Health Organization). A comprehensive description of the study area and ARI surveillance at the KHDSS outpatient health facilities has been provided in our previous publications28,29.Fig. 1Study locations, A(H3N2) virus detections in the enrolled health facilities, and distribution of detected A(H3N2) virus genetic groups by health facility in Kilifi, Kenya.

KHDSS, Kilifi Health and Demographic Surveillance System; IAV, influenza A virus.Full size imageSample handling and molecular screeningNP samples were stored in viral transport medium (VTM) at − 80 °C prior to molecular screening and subsequent laboratory processing29,30. Samples were screened for a range of respiratory viruses, including IAV, using a multiplex (MPX) reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assay employing Qiagen QuantiFast multiplex RT-PCR kit (https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/discovery-and-translational-research/pcr-qpcr-dpcreal-time-pcr-enzymes-and-kits/probe-based-one-step-qrt-pcr/quantifast-multiplex-rt-pcr-kits); a real-time PCR cycle threshold (Ct) of < 35.0 was used to define virus-positive samples30. A total of 97 IAV positive specimens were available for genome sequencing from the KHDSS facilities.RNA extraction and multi-segment real-time PCR (M-RTPCR)Viral nucleic acid extraction from IAV positive samples was performed using QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen). Extracted RNA was reverse transcribed, and the entire IAV genome amplified in a single M-RTPCR reaction using the Uni/Inf primer set31. Successful amplification was evaluated by running the products on a 2% agarose gel and visualized on a UV transilluminator after staining with RedSafe Nucleic Acid Staining solution (iNtRON Biotechnology Inc.,).IAV next generation sequencing and genome assemblyFollowing M-RTPCR, amplicon purification and library preparation was conducted as previously described5. Libraries were then diluted to 2 nmol/L, pooled, denatured, diluted to 12.5 pmol/L and sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq using 2 × 250 bp paired-end reads using the MiSeq v2 500 cycle kit with 5% Phi-X (Illumina) spike-in. Sequence assembly was performed using the Iterative Refinement Meta-Assembler (IRMA)32 in EDGE Bioinformatics environment33 using IRMA default settings: median read Q-score filter of 30; minimum read length of 125; frequency threshold for insertion and deletion refinement of 0.25 and 0.6, respectively; Smith-Waterman mismatch penalty of 5; and gap opening penalty of 10.Collation of contemporaneous global sequence datasetGlobal comparison datasets for A(H3N2) virus were retrieved from the GISAID EpiFlu™ database (https://platform.gisaid.org/epi3/cfrontend). The datasets were prepared to determine the relatedness of the viruses in this study to those circulating around the world thus understand their global context. Data processing included removal of duplicate sequences, sequences with missing dates (collection date and month), incomplete sequences, and sequences with ambiguous nucleotides (N). The data were organized into a Microsoft Excel database which also stored the associated metadata (country of origin, date of isolation, subtype, and sequence length per segment). In-house python scripts were used in the extraction and manipulation of the data. Additionally, sequences were binned by calendar year for temporal analysis. A final dataset of 1571 global sequences sampled between January 2014 and December 2016 was available (numbers in parenthesis indicate number of sequences): Africa (281); Asia (250); Europe (250); North America (250); South America (290); and Oceania (250); Figure S1. The accession numbers for the global genomes are available in the study’s GitHub repository, (https://github.com/DCollinsOwuor/H3N2_Kilifi_Kenya_molecular_epidemiology_2015-16/blob/main/H3N2_global_WGS_genome_details_2010-2016.txt).Phylogenetic analysisConsensus nucleotide sequences were aligned by pairwise alignment using MUSCLE program (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/muscle/) and translated in AliView v1.2634. The individual genome segments were concatenated into codon-complete genomes using SequenceMatrix v1.835. The full-length hemagglutinin (HA) sequences of all viruses were used to characterize A(H3N2) virus strains into genetic groups using Phylogenetic Clustering using Linear Integer Programming (PhyCLIP)36 and the European CDC Guidelines13. Maximum-likelihood (ML) phylogenetic trees of A(H3N2) virus sequences from Kilifi and global contemporaneous sequences were reconstructed using IQTREE v2.0.7, based on general time-reversible (GTR) model and bootstrap method. The software initiates tree reconstruction after assessment and selection of the best model of nucleotide substitution for alignment. The ML trees were linked to various metadata in R programming software v4.0.2 and visualized using R ggtree v2.4.237. TempEst v1.5.3 was used to assess the presence of a molecular clock signal in the analyzed data, and linear regression of root-to-tip genetic distances against sampling dates were reconstructed (Figure S2). A total of 15 outliers were excluded from the downstream analyses.Reassortment analysisThe concatenated codon-complete genomes based on sequences of all the eight individual gene segments of A(H3N2) viruses from Kilifi, were used to reconstruct a full-length phylogenetic tree then annotated by genetic group using ggtree v2.4.237. Reassortment events were assessed computationally using the Graph-incompatibility-based Reassortment Finder (GiRaF) tool38. The concatenated genome tree was used to infer the clustering patterns of each gene segment, show lineage classification of all eight individual gene segments, and detect reassortment events.Estimating A(H3N2) virus imports and exportsThe ML tree topology based on Kilifi and global sequences was used to estimate the number of viral transmission events between Kilifi and the rest of the world. TreeTime39 was used to transform the ML tree topology into a dated tree. Outlier sequences were identified by TreeTime and excluded during the process. A migration model was henceforth fitted to the resulting time-scaled phylogenetic tree from TreeTime, mapping the location status of the genomes from the nine health facilities at both the tip and internal nodes. Using the date and location annotated tree topology, the number of transitions between and within Kilifi and the rest of the world were counted and plotted using ggplot2 v3.3.3.Bayesian tip-association significance (BaTS) testThe strength of geographical clustering among the Kilifi viruses was assessed using the phylogeny-trait association test implemented in the BaTS package40. Each virus genome sequence was assigned a geographic code reflecting its place of sampling within the KHDSS. The overall statistical significance of geographical clustering of all Kilifi sequences was determined by calculating observed and expected association index and parsimony score statistics, where the null hypothesis is that clustering by geographical location is not more than that expected by chance. Additionally, the maximum clade statistic was used to compare the strength of clustering at each of the KHDSS location by calculating the expected and observed mean clade size from each of the nine outpatient locations. A significance level of p ≤ 0.05 was used in all scenarios.EthicsEthical clearance for the study was granted by the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI)—Scientific and Ethical Review Unit (SERU# 3103) and the University of Warwick Biomedical and Scientific Research Ethics Committee (BSREC# REGO-2015-6102). Informed consent was sought and received from the study participants for the study. All research was performed in accordance with relevant guidelines.ResultsIAV genome sequencing and assemblyAmong the 97 IAV positive specimens that were available from the KHDSS, 72 (74.2%) that passed pre-sequencing quality control checks were loaded onto the Illumina MiSeq. A total of 63 (87.5%) codon-complete genomes were successfully assembled following sequencing: 58 (92.1%) A(H3N2) virus and 5 (7.9%) A(H1N1)pdm09 virus sequences, respectively; only the 58 A(H3N2) virus genomes were included in the analysis. The 58 genomes comprised 4 genetic groups: clade 3C.2A (n = 34, 58.6%), subclade 3C.2A2 (n = 3, 5.2%), subclade 3C.2A3 (n = 1, 1.7%), and subgroup 3C.2A1b (n = 20, 34.5%). The socio-demographic characteristics of the patients whose samples were analyzed in this report are shown in Table 1.Table 1 Socio-demographic characteristics of Kilifi Health and demographic surveillance system (KHDSS) outpatients whose samples were successfully sequenced and passed quality control checks.Full size tableSpatiotemporal representativeness of sequenced samplesIAV was detected throughout the surveillance period in coastal Kenya (except in July, August, and September 2016) with the number of observed cases fluctuating from month-to-month (Fig. 1, Panel B). The proportion of samples from each health facility that were sequenced roughly reflected the overall distribution of positives that were detected in the specific health facilities (Fig. 1, Panel B). Clade 3C.2A and subgroup 3C.2A1b viruses were detected in most of the facilities (8 and 6 of the 9 health facilities, respectively), which suggests that A(H3N2) viruses were in circulation in most locations in Kilifi without geographical restriction to a particular lineage during 2015–16, Fig. 1, Panel C. Subclade 3C.2A2 and subclade 3C.2A3 viruses were characterized by three and one virus detection, respectively consistent with limited spread.Reassortment analysisThe concatenated codon-complete phylogenetic tree of Kilifi viruses revealed a topology in which the detected A(H3N2) virus genetic groups had consistent lineage classification for each of the eight gene segments, which occurs in the absence of reassortment, Figure S3. These findings were verified computationally using the GiRaF reassortment analysis tool, which showed no evidence of reassortment in any of the A(H3N2) viruses. The full-length codon-complete sequences, which provide a greater phylogenetic resolution, were therefore analyzed to understand the patterns of spread of A(H3N2) virus in Kilifi.A(H3N2) virus diversity in Kilifi and viral imports and exportsWe first assessed how the 58 A(H3N2) virus genomes from Kilifi compared to 1571 genomes sampled from around the world by inferring their phylogenies. The Kilifi genomes span the existing global diversity (Fig. 2A), which suggests exchange (most likely introductions into Kilifi) of viruses with other areas around the globe. We then used ancestral location state reconstruction of the dated phylogeny (Fig. 2A) to infer the number of viral imports and exports. We inferred five importations originating from outside the region (two from Europe, two from Africa, and one from North America), which represent five independent introductions into Kilifi from areas outside the region (Fig. 2B). We also inferred a total of 23 virus location transition events between the nine health facilities, Fig. 2B. International virus imports into the study area were captured at the facilities of Chasimba (n = 13, 56.5%), Matsangoni (n = 6, 26.1%), Mtondia (n = 2, 8.7%), and Mavueni (n = 2, 8.7%), while all four virus exports from the region were captured from Chasimba facility, all occurring to Africa destinations (Fig. 2B).Fig. 2(A) Time-resolved global phylogeny that combined 58 A(H3N2) virus sequences from Kilifi and 1571 global reference sequences. The Kilifi sequences are indicated with filled circles colored by health facility. (B) The number of viral imports and exports from Kilifi shown as alluvium plot.Full size imagePhylogeographic structure of A(H3N2) virus in coastal KenyaTo determine the phylogeographic structure in the Kilifi sequence data using a statistical approach, phylogeny-trait association tests were conducted to determine phylogenetic association with sampling location (health facility), Table 2. For strains from Kilifi, the results confirmed a stronger spatial clustering of sequences at all locations (p < 0.001), which is also evident in the time-resolved tree of Kilifi sequences, Figure S4. Additionally, the maximum clade statistic was significant (p ≤ 0.05) in most locations (6 out of 9 locations) reflecting predominantly local evolution in most locations. The estimated differences in observed and expected maximum clade values tentatively suggested that Pingilikani and Sokoke exhibited the least spatial structure (i.e., most mixing; difference < 0) while Matsangoni exhibited the strongest spatial structure (difference of 4).Table 2 Bayesian tip-association significance testing results.Full size tableDiscussionOwing to the paucity of studies that describe the patterns of spread of influenza on a local scale (city or town) due to sparsity of representative spatiotemporal sequence data from defined sub-populations residing in the same geography within a country, we sought to understand the transmission dynamics of influenza in a local community in coastal Kenya. We observed at least five independent introductions of A(H3N2) viruses into the region during the one-year period, with the importations originating from Africa, Europe, and North America. Additionally, we inferred 23 virus location transition events between the nine facilities included in the study. International virus imports into the study area were captured at the facilities of Chasimba, Matsangoni, Mtondia, and Mavueni, while all four exports from the region were captured from the Chasimba facility, all occurring to Africa destinations. Chasimba borders other coastal counties, most of which are major global tourist destination sites in the country. We also observed a strong spatial clustering of virus strains at all locations, which was associated with local evolution. A major analysis of virus sequences collected from inpatient and community participants from this population revealed co-circulation of multiple genetic groups of influenza viruses, with divergence from vaccine strains associated with virus evolution3. The current study aimed to understand the patterns of introduction and spread of influenza A(H3N2) virus in a local community over a one-year period.On a global scale, annual influenza A(H3N2) virus epidemics are proposed to result from the introduction of new genetic variants from East or Southeast Asia, where viruses circulate through a network of temporally overlapping epidemics14,19 or from temporally migrating metapopulations of influenza viruses that seed global epidemics18. Here, we show that the spread of influenza A(H3N2) virus in a local community in coastal Kenya was characterized by a few virus introductions over a one-year period, followed by frequent inter-facility populations transmission. We have previously reported up to 29 IBV introductions in this population in an epidemic year predominated by IBV in 20166. This reveals that repeated introductions of A(H3N2) virus and IBV into the local population drove the influenza season in 2015–16. However, unlike the IBV epidemic, only a few introductions of A(H3N2) virus instigated the 2015–16 season, which was then sustained through local spread and evolution of circulating viruses. Therefore, the seasonal dynamics of influenza are far more complex. Wider and deeper sampling of viruses from understudied tropical and sub-tropical regions is required for a more complete understanding of the local, regional, and global spread of influenza viruses27,41.The genetic diversity of A(H3N2) virus in specific regions arising from multiple virus importations and subsequent local evolution, as shown in our study, could lead to predominance of circulating viruses that are not closely matched to previously selected vaccine strains. In countries like Kenya, where virus circulation is year-round42, there also exists unpredictability of which genetic strain may predominate and when. Influenza vaccines with broad coverage (“universal” vaccines) could be key to managing the disease burden in such settings. Currently, Kenya does not have a national influenza vaccination policy43, but it would be important to consider deployment of trivalent influenza vaccines with representative A(H3N2) virus, A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, and B/Victoria for optimal vaccine effectiveness. It will also be important to investigate further whether the use of southern hemisphere or northern hemisphere formulated vaccines could have a place in tropical regions like in Kenya, where virus importations from both hemispheres are common. However, the genetic strains reported in Kenya during one-year study period were reported in other African countries44,45 and in Asia46. Thus, the continuing evolution of A(H3N2) in Kilifi is in part due to the global circulation of the virus.Inclusion of regional and global sequences deposited in GISAID significantly improved the power of our phylogenomic analyses, which showed that the Kilifi diversity was part of the global continuum. For example, we showed extensive geographical mixing of local strains with global strains from Europe and North America. The use of NGS technology to generate virus sequence data from Kilifi enables further scrutiny of the available data to answer other key molecular epidemiological questions. For example, the sequencing depth achieved with NGS may allow for further analysis of minority variant populations. These might be evolving locally in coastal Kenya region thus undermining the assumption that vaccines matched to globally dominant strains in trivalent/quadrivalent vaccines may necessarily protect against these local strains in a local population. Additionally, we have demonstrated the utility of NGS data analysis to investigate reassortment events in influenza viruses.The study had some limitations. First, the study utilized samples collected from outpatients only, but would have benefitted from additional analysis of samples collected from hospitalized patients to investigate the patterns of spread of A(H3N2) virus in Kilifi. Second, the prioritized samples were selected based on anticipated probability of successful sequencing inferred from the sample’s viral load as indicated by the diagnosis Ct value. This strategy ultimately avoided NGS of some samples that may have been critical in reconstructing the patterns of spread and transmission clusters of A(H3N2) virus in coastal Kenya. Third, the KHDSS outpatient facilities surveillance collected a maximum of fifteen samples per week per site. This paucity of sequence data from some locations may have introduced bias in inference of the phylogeographic structure of A(H3N2) virus in coastal Kenya.In conclusion, although there is paucity of studies that describe the patterns of spread of influenza on a local scale (city or town), our findings suggest that considerable influenza virus diversity circulates within defined sub-populations residing in the same geography within a country, including virus lineages that are unique to those locales, as reported for Kilifi. These lineages may be capable of dissemination to other populations through virus location transition events. Further knowledge of the viral lineages that circulate in specific locales is required to understand the main drivers of novel cases of respiratory diseases and to inform vaccination strategies within these populations.

Also today, the CDC shared the latest findings from genetic sequencing, which so far show no worrying changes.Two patients worked on the same farmMost of the earlier patients infected at California farms were from different facilities, but CDPH said two of the workers are from the same Central Valley farm. Both of them were exposed to infected cows, suggesting that only animal-to-human transmission is occurring in California.The CDC said in an update today that the two people from the same farm worked on different parts of the farm, and aren’t close contacts of each other. All six patients have experienced mild symptoms, including conjunctivitis. All were treated based on CDC guidance, and none were hospitalized.CDPH added a seventh possible human case has been reported from the Central Valley and the specimen has been sent to the CDC for confirmation testing.The new confirmations push the national total of H5 cases this year to 20. All but one are related to contact with sick cows and poultry. Health officials are still investigating the source of a human H5 infection in Missouri and whether illness symptoms in seven contacts, one household member and six healthcare workers.No red flags in latest CDC sequencing findingsThe CDC said it has now sequenced viruses from three patients, and all are closely related to viruses in dairy cattle.Though the hemagglutinin of the three sequenced viruses has new amino acid changes compared to closely related candidate vaccine viruses, none are linked to increased infectivity or transmissibility among humans.Also, sequencing hasn’t found any changes that suggest reduced susceptibility to antiviral treatments or any changes in other gene segments that would suggest mammalian adaptation.CDC scientists successfully isolated the virus from California’s first two confirmed cases, and results are pending for similar work on other samples.Dairy farm outbreaks reach 100 in CaliforniaIn a related development, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Inspection (APHIS) confirmed one more H5N1 outbreak in a California dairy herd, raising the state’s total since late August to 100, and the national total to 300 from 14 states.California is the nation’s biggest dairy producer. The state has more than 1,100 dairy farms that house 1.72 million milk cows, according to the California Milk Advisory Board.

FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. – As highly pathogenic avian influenza continues to infect more than just birds, scientists and industry professionals want to prevent it from infecting more species and continuing to impact animal and human health, the environment and the economy. The four-day International Avian Influenza and One Health Emerging Issues Summit hosted by the Center of Excellence for Poultry Science had a total of 1,270 registered participants from 51 countries, in-person and virtually, to share and learn more about HPAI, or highly pathogenic avian influenza, and other diseases impacting animals and humans. Guillermo Tellez-Isaias, the chairman of the summit and retired research professor for the Center of Excellence for Poultry Science and the Arkansas Agricultural Experiment Station, says there are other threats to animal and human health in addition to the bird flu. "The highly pathogenic avian influenza virus has naturally been able to adapt to species that it never infected before. If it fully adapts to humans, COVID-19 will look like a small cold compared to what this virus could cause," Tellez-Isaias said, comparing its threat to the Spanish flu in 1918. "So, that's why we wanted to have this summit, to create awareness for people worldwide." Tellez-Isaias said participants at the summit will produce a document with guidelines and recommendations for national and international health authorities, based on group discussions and expert presentations, to help guide future efforts in combating highly pathogenic avian influenza and other emerging health threats. The Center of Excellence for Poultry Science is part of the University of Arkansas System Division of Agriculture and the University of Arkansas Dale Bumpers College of Agricultural, Food and Life Sciences. The center performs the three land grant missions of teaching — carried out through Bumpers College — and research and extension through the Division of Agriculture's Arkansas Agricultural Experiment Station and Cooperative Extension Service. After a successful inaugural event in 2023, Tellez-Isaias said, organizers expanded the scope in the second year to include other emerging issues affecting cattle, swine, bees, humans and more as part of the One Health concept, which emphasizes that animal, human and environmental health are all interconnected. "The first two days, we focused on highly pathogenic avian influenza, but not only in poultry. We extended it to wild and commercial animals, including dairy," Tellez-Isaias said. "And we discussed avian influenza and other diseases, including exotic diseases like the African swine fever, which is already in our backyard in the Dominican Republic. It's something we are keeping an eye on." Urgency of collaboration Tellez-Isaias says it's urgent to focus on these diseases globally, as bird flu has spread to different species in all continents including Antarctica. "These diseases know no borders," he said. Members of industry, governmental and regulatory agencies, and scientists from around the world presented their work at the summit. Tellez-Isaias said their findings could improve animal health overall and potentially contribute to minimizing the impacts of bird flu and other viruses. From the Division of Agriculture, Sami Dridi, professor of poultry science, talked about poultry production sustainability, specifically heat stress challenges and potential mechanism-based strategies. Dridi's research includes working with chickens bred to conserve water while maintaining growth under heat stress. He found that water efficiency is improving with each new generation and has the potential to expand with application to other poultry operations, such as turkeys and ducks. Tomi Obe, assistant professor with the Center of Excellence for Poultry Science and the poultry science department, presented research on pre- and post-harvest strategies for salmonella control in poultry production. She discussed different methods to consider at feed mills, farms and the processors. Obe is also part of the Arkansas Center for Food Safety within the food science department. Jada Thompson, assistant professor in the agricultural economics and agribusiness department, talked about the economic impacts of highly pathogenic avian influenza, including how the disease impacts producers and consumers. Bill Potter, associate professor and extension poultry specialist with the Division of Agriculture, discussed One Health strategies to optimize poultry intestinal integrity and pre-harvest food safety. He discussed proposed regulations around salmonella and shared research showing the efficacy of implementing vaccines in poultry. Adnan Alrubaye, assistant professor of poultry science, talked about management practices to mitigate lameness in broiler chickens caused by specific bacteria. Those attending the summit included both international and local researchers, veterinarians and private sector professionals. Amanda Bray, a poultry science alumna and co-owner of Northwest Arkansas Veterinary Services in Springdale, said staying informed on industry trends domestically and internationally helps her learn what services to offer. "Our primary focus is the poultry and dairy industries," Bray said. "And [bird flu] is a very big problem. So, the more knowledge I have, the better I know how to support others in the industry and what tests we need to develop and offer." United front for global health Liliana Monroy is founder and CEO of Natural Animal Health, a company providing gut health products to producers. Monroy said she has garnered a long-trusting relationship with researchers with the Division of Agriculture, and that "collaboration is vital" to fight highly pathogenic avian influenza. "If you want to be successful, you have to go to the people who know more," Monroy said. "And you need to work very closely with professors and researchers. We cannot work in silos. Since we come from different backgrounds, we need to unite efforts with doctors, environmental entities, leaders in the private sector, and so on, to stop what's going on." Monroy, who also presented during the conference, says biosecurity protocols, although crucial to preventing the spread of bird flu, have also created many roadblocks for businesses and producers. The International Avian Influenza Summit was hosted by the University of Arkansas System Division of Agriculture, the Dale Bumpers College of Agricultural, Food and Life Sciences, and the Center of Excellence for Poultry Science. The American College of Poultry Veterinarians and the American Veterinary Medical Association approved the conference for continuing education credits with 23 and 26 CE credits respectively and the Professional Animal Auditor Certification Organization with 12 CE credits. The event was held at the Don Tyson Center for Agricultural Sciences in Fayetteville, Sept. 30 through Oct. 3.

In an effort to increase uptake, the study authors designed six electronic letters to be sent to patients emphasizing benefits of vaccination. In total, 299,881 Danish patients aged 18 to 64 years with chronic diseases were included in the study. The main outcome was receipt of seasonal flu vaccine by January 2024.Influenza vaccination rates were higher among those receiving any intervention letter (39.6%) compared to the standard care of no letter (27.9%). A letter emphasizing the benefits of vaccination for cardiac health was most effective, with 39.8% vaccinated compared to 27.9% in standard care.The results of this study suggest that simple, scalable, and cost-efficient electronic letter strategies may have substantial public health implications."The results of this study suggest that simple, scalable, and cost-efficient electronic letter strategies may have substantial public health implications," the authors concluded. Marburg infects 3 more in Rwanda; most outbreak cases tied to hospital clusters News brief Lisa Schnirring Topics Marburg Viral Hemorrhagic Fever After 2 days with no new Marburg virus cases, Rwanda’s health ministry today reported three new infections and one more death from the disease, raising the outbreak total to 61 cases, 14 of them fatal. NIAID/Flickr cc The ministry said all new cases reported since its initial announcement have been within a hospital cluster in Kigali and their contacts. Thirty one people remain in isolation and treatment, and 16 people have recovered from their illnesses.Vaccination using an experimental Marburg vaccine from the Sabin Vaccine Institute launched last weekend, and 501 people at high risk have now been immunized.WHO weighs in on outbreak developments, travel advisoriesIn a related development, the World Health Organization (WHO) posted an update on Rwanda’s update, its first, noting that the vast majority of cases are from three districts within Kigali. All new cases confirmed in the past week are associated with two hospital clusters in Kigali, the country’s capital.So far, more than 700 contacts have been identified and are under monitoring. The contact who is known to have traveled to Germany is still being monitored by local health officials, and a contact who traveled to Belgium has completed the 21-day monitoring period.Separately, the WHO issued a statement yesterday that said travel and trade restrictions are ineffective for controlling the ongoing Marburg outbreak in Rwanda, and can hurt affected countries and discourage countries from rapidly sharing data. It noted that several countries have introduced travel-related measures, including temporarily discouraging travel to Rwanda. The United States recently upgraded its travel advisory for Rwanda, recommending against nonessential travel, and announced that health screening for inbound travelers from Rwanda will begin on October 14. US COVID levels drop, with few flu detections News brief Lisa Schnirring Topics COVID-19 Influenza, General COVID activity in the United States continues to decline, and seasonal flu markers show no upticks, according to the latest respiratory disease updates today from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Jernej Furman/Flickr cc For COVID, test positivity has declined to 7.7% nationally, but is a little higher in the Western region that includes the Dakotas, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, and Utah. Emergency department visits for COVID continue to decline. Hospitalizations remain on a downward trend. Deaths also declined, though CDC provisional data show 424 people died from their COVID infections last week.CDC SARS-CoV-2 detections drop to low levelCDC wastewater detections have now declined to low, with levels in the West a bit higher than other regions. Tracking from WastewaterSCAN, a national wastewater monitoring system based at Stanford University in partnership with Emory University, shows that SARS-CoV-2 detections are at the medium level nationally, with a 3-week downward trend. The South is now at the low level. For flu, activity is still at the low level, and of the few viruses reported by public health labs last week, 55.8% were the 2009 H1N1 strain and 42.2% were H3N2, the CDC in its latest weekly FluView report. EPA to review resistance risks of antibacterial, antifungal pesticides News brief Chris Dall, MA Topics Antimicrobial Stewardship The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) this week finalized its framework for expanding federal collaboration on the review of antibacterial and antifungal pesticides.The framework establishes a process through which the EPA will consider expert input from other federal agencies when evaluating whether use of antibacterial or antifungal pesticides may result in the development or spread of antibacterial or antifungal resistance. It was developed in coordination with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the US Department of Agriculture (USDA).Farmers use antibacterial and antifungal pesticides to treat crop diseases such as apple scab, citrus greening, fire blight, and gray mold. But there is concern that widespread use of these pesticides, which share characteristics or modes of action with antibiotics and antifungals used in human and animal medicine, could promote the development of resistance to those drugs, potentially reducing their effectiveness.Balancing risks, benefitsThe EPA says the framework is designed to recognize the benefits of these pesticides to agriculture while minimizing their impact on human and animal health and considering the issue through a One Health approach."This framework will strengthen the shared goals of EPA, HHS, USDA, and the White House in protecting relevant human and animal drugs while ensuring growers can continue to have access to important tools to protect their crops from fungal and bacterial diseases," Ed Messina, JD, director of EPA’s Office of Pesticide Programs, said in an agency press release. New polio cases recorded in 4 countries News brief Stephanie Soucheray, MA Topics Polio Four countries have new polio cases this week, including Pakistan with four more wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases and Angola, Nigeria, and South Sudan with vaccine-derived cases, according to the weekly report from the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI).Also noted in the report, Spain has its first positive environmental sample, from Barcelona, and French Guiana has multiple positive environmental samples. Pakistan now has 28 cases of WPV1 this year. The new cases all experienced paralysis onset in September, and were located in Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Sindh provinces.In Angola, the new detection of a circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) case raises the year’s total to seven. Nigeria now has 61 cVDPV2 cases for 2024 after this week’s four cases, and South Sudan now has nine. First environmental sample detected in Spain Two countries reported environmental samples of vaccine-derived polio for the first time this week."One cVDPV2-positive environmental sample has been reported this week, from the Barcelona metropolitan area, Catalonia, with collection in September," the GPEI said. "This is the first time cVDPV2 has been reported in Spain."This is the first time cVDPV2 has been reported in Spain.Similarly, French Guianareported three circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 3-positive environmental samples collected in Cayenne province in May, June, and August. CEPI announces $3.2 million toward CIDRAP's roadmap News brief Stephanie Soucheray, MA Topics COVID-19 MERS-CoV vladans / iStock Today the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) announced it has awarded $3.2 million to the Center of Infectious Diseases Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, which publishes CIDRAP News. The funds will be distributed over a 3-year period.The award will advance CIDRAP’s Coronavirus Vaccines Research and Development (R&D) Roadmap, an open access tool started in 2022 aimed at developing vaccines to target coronaviruses, including COVID-19, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), or future viruses that could cause pandemics.“CEPI’s support and collaboration with CIDRAP will fast forward our efforts at creating broadly protective coronavirus vaccines,” said Michael T. Osterholm, regents professor at the University of Minnesota and director of CIDRAP, in a press release from CEPI.Online summary of trials The roadmap, created under the guidance of 50 scientific leaders, will offer an online summary of all broadly protective coronavirus vaccines in preclinical and clinical development and an online dashboard tracking funding and investment. The original roadmap received financial support from The Rockefeller and Gates Foundations.COVID-19 was the third new coronavirus to strike in the past 20 years, portending the emergence of further novel coronaviruses with epidemic and pandemic potential."COVID-19 was the third new coronavirus to strike in the past 20 years, portending the emergence of further novel coronaviruses with epidemic and pandemic potential," said Kent Kester, MD, executive director of vaccine R&D at CEPI. "Having the latest information on vaccine research and progress within coronavirus vaccine R&D readily and openly available in CIDRAP’s roadmap will enhance the approach being pursued by CEPI and other scientific investigators around the world to develop vaccines that could confer protection against multiple coronaviruses at the same time."

If confirmed, the illness would mark the third recent H5 infection in a California dairy worker.The CDPH said there is no known link to the two recent cases, and that all three patients had contact with infected animals at three different farms. Like the first two cases, the most recent probable patient had mild symptoms that included conjunctivitis. None of the patients were hospitalized.If confirmed by the CDC, the latest illness would push the nation’s human H5 case count since the first of the year to 17. All but one—which involves a patient from Missouri—have been connected to contact with sick cows or poultry.H5N1 infects more dairy cows in CaliforniaIn related developments, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has confirmed 26 more H5N1 outbreaks in cows at California dairy farms, pushing the national total to 282 across 14 states.The latest confirmations make California the hardest hit state, with 82 outbreaks reported so far. California, which has ramped up surveillance around affected farms with weekly bulk-milk testing, now has the most outbreaks of any state, despite the fact that it reported its first outbreaks in cows at the end of August. California is the nation’s largest dairy producer.

As it does every year, the CDC recommends everyone 6 months or older receive the updated flu vaccine, with rare exceptions.1 But this year, the influenza vaccine is different from the one last season: COVID-19 has become a major player alongside influenza, and patients may be asking about a new virus strain. Read on for the latest information.Change from quadrivalent to trivalent vaccinesIn March 2024, the FDA recommended influenza virus strains with a trivalent vaccine composition for use in the upcoming 2024-2025 flu season; last season, a quadrivalent vaccine was used. These trivalent seasonal influenza vaccines include 2 influenza A viruses (H1N1) and 1 influenza B virus.The FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) recommended that the trivalent formulation of egg-based influenza vaccines contain the following2:an A/Victoria/4897/2022 (H1N1)pdm09–like virus;an A/Thailand/8/2022 (H3N2)–like virus; anda B/Austria/1359417/2021 (B/Victoria lineage)–like virus.For the trivalent formulation of cell- or recombinant-based influenza vaccine, the committee recommended the following2:an A/Wisconsin/67/2022 (H1N1)pdm09–like virus;an A/Massachusetts/18/2022 (H3N2)–like virus; anda B/Austria/1359417/2021 (B/Victoria lineage)–like virus.As to which strain might be more severe, Jane M. Carnazzo, MD, FAAP, a pediatrician with Children’s Physicians in Omaha, Nebraska, noted, “Typically, influenza A is more severe than influenza B, but there [have] been years where I’ve seen B just as virulent as A. This year, it’s kind of anybody’s guess.”Why the change from the quadrivalent to the trivalent formulation for this season? “One of the strains that had been circulating—the B/Yamagata—has been dormant since 2020,” explained Rebecca Snead, RPh, senior director, strategic initiatives and long-term care division, at the National Community Pharmacists Association. “[VRBPAC], back in October 2023, had signaled that since the strain has been dormant, perhaps we could drop it because there’s no sense in getting vaccinated against something that is not being seen. So, we’re going back to the trivalent [composition], which has historically always been the flu vaccine.”But, Snead added, some challenges may lie ahead when it comes to public messaging. “Some people might not understand the messaging and think because we are going from a quadrivalent to a trivalent vaccine, that maybe the flu is not so bad now,” she explained. “I think as health care providers, we need to be educated and tell our patients that the trivalent vaccine is what is needed to protect the public, and it is absolutely full protection.”There is also a nasal spray vaccination option, but that comes with its own brand of skepticism. “Often with children, the nasal spray vaccine, which is a live attenuated vaccine, works better than the shot,” Carnazzo said. “But I have heard people say, ‘Oh, I got the [nasal spray] vaccine, and then I got flu, so I never got the vaccine again.’ It’s important to let patients know that they cannot get the flu from the nasal spray. Because it’s an attenuated live vaccine, there is a small chance of getting a little nasal congestion or something like that, but they won’t get influenza from it.”How COVID-19 affects flu seasonCOVID-19 has permanently changed the landscape of flu season. Today, preparing for this highly contagious period means getting vaccinated for both viruses. “This year is going to be the first season where the COVID-19 vaccines are going to be available [when] or very soon after the flu vaccine is available,” Snead said. “And we can begin conditioning the American public to get their COVID-19 vaccine as well, just like every other respiratory virus vaccine.”Following its Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices meeting in June, the CDC recommended both the updated 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccine and the updated 2024-2025 flu vaccine to prevent severe cases of COVID-19 and influenza this fall and winter.1When should patients be vaccinated?Snead, who has spoken with manufacturers of this year’s vaccines, said, “There should be ample supply and very timely access to influenza vaccines this year. There are not any unexpected hiccups at this point. Typically [the vaccines] start arriving in early August.”When should the public expect to get their vaccine? “Timing [is] something we as pharmacists need to keep in mind,” Snead explained. “If you [as a pharmacist] get the vaccine in late July or August, go ahead and vaccinate pregnant people in their third trimester to help them and to protect the baby." Added Carnazzo, “For [those of] us in pediatrics, you get them when you can get them. Vaccinating patients from mid-September to mid-October is the sweet spot.”And don’t forget individuals who have had a solid organ transplant. “They need a higher dose of the vaccine. There is a higher concentration of vaccination for this population group, and it’s important that they get vaccinated as well,” Carnazzo said.The bird flu questionAvian influenza, also called bird flu, has been on the public radar since April 2024, when an individual in Texas became the first human infected with novel avian influenza A(H5N1).3 Since then, additional cases have been confirmed in multiple US states, although the CDC’s human health risk assessment for the public remains low.Although public risk is low, the World Health Organization “is operating in a constant state of readiness for a potential influenza pandemic,” said Maria Van Kerkhove, PhD, head of epidemic and pandemic preparedness and prevention at the World Health Organization, in an article published in Nature.4At the time of publication, there have been only 9 cases of avian influenza in the US this year: 4 following exposures to dairy cows, and 5 following exposures to poultry.5 “Right now, the bird flu is still considered to be an extremely low risk. It is being monitored very closely,” Snead said. “But this is a question that pharmacists may get asked when they are administering the flu vaccine: ‘Will this protect me against bird flu?’ And the answer is no. However, the United States has invested in developing a vaccine for the bird flu, just in case it becomes necessary. But it’s not a worry at this point.”Editor’s note: This article was originally published by our sister publication Drug Topics.A previous version of this article stated "Children 18 years and younger need 2 doses, so if you have the vaccine early, and you have a child and parent in your pharmacy, you want that child to [receive] that first dose of the flu vaccine in August," however, it should be "children 6-months through 8-years-old (up to their 9th birthday) need 2 doses of the Flu vaccine the first year they receive it."References:1.

Plus, we’re seeing sports injuries on top of that right now – fractures and concussions. No surge of any specific thing, which is kind of unusual for this time of the year. We had a surge of asthmatic patients, but that went away, and we’re not seeing a lot of flu or RSV or respiratory viruses.”Dr. Luda Khait-Vlisides -- Emergency Physician, DMC Sinai-Grace Hospital“Flu A and Flu B, I’ve seen a couple now – that’s early, and some adenovirus and upper respiratory viruses. I usually don’t get my flu shot until the end of October, but I got mine last week. Not as much COVID as we had been seeing. Strep is on the downtrend, too.”Dr. Jennifer Stevenson -- Emergency Department, Henry Ford Medical Center Fairlane“This is that tricky time of year when the seasons change from hot to cold. We’re seeing more chronic pain flare-ups, headaches, and lots of falls. Plus, asthma and COPD flare-ups are also affecting a lot of people.”Trinity Health Livonia Emergency Department“We are still seeing a slight increase with COVID patients and viral respiratory issues.”Oakland County – Hand, foot & mouth disease, COVID, asthma flare-ups, stomach viruses, strep throat, fall allergiesDr. Steve McGraw -- Emergency Department, Henry Ford Providence Southfield Hospital “We’re seeing a rise in COVID cases, asthma flare-ups due to the weather, strep throat, and other fall viruses like gastroenteritis and hand, foot & mouth disease. With the sun setting earlier, be extra cautious about kids on bikes, and make sure they’re wearing helmets.”Dr. Evelyn Laskowski -- Division Chief, Corewell Health Children’s in Royal Oak“We are seeing a slight uptick in viral illnesses. We are also starting to see more asthma exacerbations. There have been lots of patients with rhinovirus/enterovirus, which is like the common cold. It can cause breathing problems in some individuals.”Dr. Parag Patel -- Primary Care Physician, Corewell Health Beaumont Troy Hospital“We are seeing quite a few patients with allergies. Also, upper respiratory infections lead to ear and sinus infections. We have also started to see strep in school-age kids.”Dr. Rena Daiza -- Primary Care Physician, Henry Ford Medical Center Bloomfield Twp.“Viruses are definitely making the rounds, and that includes hand, foot & mouth disease. It’s pretty common in children, causing mouth sores and rashes on the hands and feet. If your child shows any of these symptoms, it’s important to get them checked out since it’s highly contagious. Also, just a reminder to stay up to date with vaccinations—many viral symptoms can be prevented.”Henry Ford West Bloomfield Hospital Emergency Department“We’re seeing quite a few patients coming in with pain in different areas, including the chest, and some with stroke-like symptoms.“Washtenaw County – Respiratory illnesses, outdoor injuries, upper respiratory infections, COVID, strep throat, influenzaDr. Marisa Louie -- Medical Director of Children’s Emergency Services, Michigan Medicine“Still a good number of respiratory illnesses, though they are trending down. We saw a lot of injuries with the beautiful weather last weekend.”Dr. Brad Uren -- Clinical Associate Professor of Emergency Medicine, Michigan Medicine“We’re still seeing some COVID but there are more COVID negative URIs and occasional strep this week.”Washtenaw County Health Department“Influenza cases in Washtenaw County residents are currently at low levels. Sporadic cases of influenza A and influenza B are being reported. Most influenza cases being reported in Washtenaw county are influenza B. Influenza wastewater detection is currently at low levels in both Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti.”Monroe County – Breathing problems, stomach pain, dizziness, fall allergiesProMedica Monroe Regional Hospital Emergency Center“We are experiencing patients coming in with respiratory symptoms, abdominal pain, and complaints of dizziness.”Macomb County – Upper respiratory infections, stomach viruses, outdoor injuries, COVID, sore throats, strep throatDr. Ali Saad -- Emergency Physician at McLaren Macomb“Upper respiratory infections and symptoms of congestion, slight fever, and cough, along with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea symptomatic of gastroenteritis, have noticeably increased. Patients testing positive for COVID-19 have been trending down over the past week, with patients mainly being discharged from the ER following treatment. Orthopedic and soft tissue injuries continue to be treated in high volumes at the emergency and trauma center.”Dr. Maria Samuel -- Primary Care Physician, Henry Ford Medical Center Sterling Heights“Right now, we’re getting a lot of patients testing positive for COVID, as well as dealing with viral sore throats, colds, and strep throat. “Livingston County -- Respiratory viruses, fall allergies, COVIDTrinity Health Livingston Emergency Department“Slight bump in COVID cases in Livingston.

None of the individuals has been hospitalized,” the CDPH said.At a briefing last week, federal health officials commended California for actively monitoring workers and quickly identifying and following up on people with symptoms.If the CDC confirms that state’s two latest cases, the national total would rise to 19 since the first of the year. Except for a patient in Missouri, all infections were linked to contact with sick cows or poultry.H5N1 strikes 13 more California dairy farmsThe US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has confirmed 13 more H5N1 avian flu outbreaks in California’s dairy cows, bringing the state’s total since late August to 96.The first outbreak in the state was reported in September, and the rapid pace of spread in California—the nation’s largest dairy producer—has already made it the hardest-hit state.The new outbreaks push the national total to 296 across 14 states.Wild bird positive from outbreak areaAs the investigation continues into how the virus is spreading among California’s farms, recent sampling from harvested wild birds in one of the affected Central Valley counties has turned up positive H5N1 findings.According to the APHIS wild bird confirmation list, the five birds that tested positive in Tulare County were sampled between September 17 and 21. Species included starlings, blackbirds, and a dove.In other developments, USDA APHIS confirmed one more H5N1 outbreak in poultry, which involves a location in Miami-Dade County that has 70 birds. The report didn’t note the type of facility that housed the birds, but many of the of the state’s recent outbreaks in Miami-Dade involved live bird markets.

Its spread poses a significant threat to poultry farming, food security and the livelihoods of millions of people, affecting poorer populations the most. While some countries have used vaccination to control the disease, others have yet to do so or need to improve their vaccination programmes for better prevention.In this context, the FAO Virtual Learning Centers developed an online course,Vaccine stewardship in prevention and control of highly pathogenic avian influenza, which was piloted in Asia and the Pacific region between June and July 2024. This course aimed to provide countries with practical guidance on HPAI vaccination strategies, covering the twelve principles of avian influenza vaccination stewardship, decision-making on vaccination use, and how to implement effective vaccination programmes. Experts Leslie Sims and David E. Swayne, who contributed to the development of this course, share their insights on the role of vaccine stewardship to control HPAI.What is vaccine stewardship? Can it benefit both endemic and avian influenza-free countries?Many countries are expressing interest in using vaccination as an additional tool to help control and prevent HPAI. The concept of avian influenza vaccination stewardship was developed to help countries make decisions on whether vaccination can be of benefit and, if so, build appropriate vaccination programmes against HPAI that generate sustained high levels of immunity in the vaccinated population. If this cannot be achieved, there is a risk of infection occurring in vaccinated flocks and driving changes in the virus that allow it to resist the immunity produced.The course also built on successful experiences with vaccination, such as programmes introduced to update vaccines when needed in China, Indonesia, Viet Nam and Mexico.A vaccination programme should be comprehensive, use the latest scientific knowledge, and be well-designed for the individual country's poultry production system and based on the risks of the poultry species and geographical area. It should be applicable to the control of HPAI in endemic countries and usable as prevention in emergency programmes in countries at risk of introduction or imminent introduction in poultry.Can vaccine stewardship be a tool for veterinary services to overcome avian influenza? Why might it be preferable to use this approach?Vaccination stewardship helps veterinary services to develop appropriate vaccination programmes that produce sustained high-level immunity in vaccinated poultry. Every country using vaccination should adopt the principles of avian influenza vaccination stewardship.Can vaccination alone control the disease? What other measures can be effective in controlling avian influenza?One of the key points we emphasize is that vaccination alone does not resolve the problems of avian influenza. It must be combined with and added to existing and, preferably, enhanced biosecurity measures. It also must be subject to appropriate surveillance to identify infections, if any, in the vaccinated population.What outcomes can be expected from the training in terms of improved control measures?The main objective of the course is to provide participants with the knowledge needed to develop and implement appropriate avian influenza vaccination programmes. Although we focus on a single disease – HPAI – the approach varies from country to country. We are already seeing increasing uptake of systematic preventive vaccination against avian influenza and the course can help countries in this process.Many countries have used vaccines, but avian influenza is still endemic in their territory; why is it difficult to eradicate the disease?Vaccination was introduced in countries like China, Viet Nam, Egypt and Indonesia because the virus was already endemic. For a variety of reasons, it has not been possible to eliminate the virus by stamping-out methods. In Viet Nam, about 30 million poultry were destroyed in 2004, but it has not yet been possible to eliminate the virus or prevent severe cases of disease in humans. Vaccination has been successfully added as an additional measure to reduce the effects of the disease and largely prevent serious human infections. Repeated incursions of HPAI introduced from wild birds and subsequent spread to poultry have occurred in several countries. The cost of these outbreaks is remarkably high, and preventive vaccination should be considered in all countries with repeated and costly outbreaks. Vaccination stewardship helps countries where the virus is still present to explore ways to improve disease control. We recommend annual reviews of vaccination programmes to assess whether the goals of the vaccination programme are being met and whether changes to the programme are needed (changes in areas where vaccine is used, in vaccines, in the target population, and even changes in the way poultry is raised and sold).A major misconception about vaccination is that it has led or will lead to endemic infection, when in fact it has been a response to endemic infection. We have good examples where vaccination has been used successfully as a preventive measure and endemic infection in poultry has not occurred. About the experts Leslie SimsLeslie Sims has been involved in the prevention and control of HPAI since 1985, both as a government veterinarian and an FAO consultant for19 years. In 1997, he was working in Hong Kong when the first HPAI cases were identified, spearheading local efforts to eradicate the virus and prevent the recurrence of the disease. Recognizing the limitations of movement control and biosecurity, he became a strong advocate for vaccination as an additional measure to prevent HPAI. David E. SwayneDavid E. Swayne has been at the forefront of avian influenza research and control of avian influenza since 1987, starting as a faculty member at the College of Veterinary Medicine at The Ohio State University. From 1994 to 2022, he directed the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Southeast Poultry National Viral Disease Research Laboratory, focusing on HPAI, Newcastle disease, and other avian viral diseases. Since 2023, he has served as a private veterinarian, advising organic and poultry production companies, as well as national and global poultry industry groups. He also works with FAO and the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) on HPAI prevention and control.

(WHSV) - In 2024, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention has noted 17 cases of avian influenza in humans.Avian influenza is typically found in dairy cows, poultry and other animals.The CDC recommends everyone six months or older get their flu vaccine. Central Shenandoah Health District Director Dr. Allison Baroco said folks who work in agriculture could especially benefit from getting the vaccine.“It’s possible that if somebody were to get seasonal flu and then they were exposed to H5N1, [the avian flu,] those viruses could mix in their body and potentially mutate and cause problems,” Dr. Baroco said.Dr. Baroco said there has not been any cases of the viruses combining and mutating.Flu season can peak at different times of the year, especially around the holidays.“The [seasonal] influenza virus causes fevers, body aches, muscle aches,” Dr. Baroco said. “It can make people sick enough to want to stay in bed, especially those who aren’t vaccinated.”Dr. Baroco said there are avian influenza cases in Missouri that are being investigated. There is concern that there was possible human-to-human transmission but that has not been confirmed.“I think there have not been enough cases to know the severity in the general population of what being exposed to the avian influenza is compared to the seasonal flu,” Dr. Baroco said.The CDC recommends everyone 6 months or older should get the flu vaccine, preferably before Oct. 31, so communities can create herd immunity.Copyright 2024 WHSV.

Everything You Need to Know By Kelly Burch Updated on October 09, 2024 Medically reviewed by Jenny Sweigard, MD Print Table of Contents View All Table of Contents Flu Transmission Explained When You’re Contagious Flu Prevention Close Influenza, more commonly known as the flu, is most often spread when a person comes into contact with droplets or aerosols that contain mucus from an infected person. But is the flue airborne? Some research shows that approximately half of flu cases may stem from airborne transmission. It can also be spread from surfaces. Knowing how the flu is spread can help you prevent infection and minimize your risk. Hiraman / Getty Images Flu Transmission Explained The flu is a virus that is most often spread when someone comes into contact with droplets from an infected person. These droplets are produced when a person with the flu coughs or sneezes, spreading infected mucus around them for up to 6 feet. Droplets vs. Aerosols Droplets are heavy. They generally sink to the ground within about 6 feet of the infected person. That means if you stay more than 6 feet away, you are less likely to become infected. Scientists believe that most flu transmission happens when a person inhales these droplets or enters their eye, nose, or mouth. Aerosols are produced by coughing or sneezing, just like droplets. However, they are smaller and lighter, so they float in the air longer. If the flu is airborne, that means the infectious virus can spread even if you stay more than six feet away. Researchers are still unclear about how much of the flu is spread via airborne transmission, but one study indicates that at least half of transmission happens via airborne particles. Through Human Contact When you’re close to someone, you’re more likely to come into contact with their respiratory secretions, such as mucus from the upper respiratory tract. The flu virus can also live on the skin of someone who has the virus, when these respiratory droplets or other bodily fluids fall to the skin. When you come into contact with these fluids, you can be exposed to the flu virus and contract influenza. On Surfaces Occasionally, the flu can be spread when you touch a surface that has the virus on it, and then touch your own eyes, nose, or mouth, allowing the virus to enter your body. This is called surface transmission. The flu can survive for up to 48 hours on hard objects like doorknobs. It survives for a shorter time on cloth and other porous surfaces. When You’re Contagious After you’ve come into contact with the virus, you can develop symptoms anywhere from one to four days later. You can begin spreading the flu one day before symptoms appear. You’re contagious for up to seven days, but most likely to infect someone else in the first three to four days of illness. Flu Prevention The best way to prevent the flu is by getting vaccinated with a flu vaccine and practicing good hygiene, including washing your hands frequently. Getting the seasonal flu vaccine reduces your risk of contracting the flu by 40%-60%, depending on the year. It also reduces your risk of hospitalization or death from the flu. All Americans who are 6 months or older unless advised otherwise by their healthcare provider can get the flu vaccine to reduce their risk of contracting the flu. To reduce your chances of contracting the flu: Get vaccinated annually.Wash your hands frequently.Minimize contact with infected people, where possible; wear a mask if contact is unavoidable.Stay home when you are sick, and wear a mask if you must go out.Avoid touching your nose, mouth, or eyes, particularly in public.Lead an overall healthy lifestyle. Flu Season and COVID Prevention During the early years of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a dramatic decrease in flu cases, especially during the 2020-2021 flu season. Researchers believe that this was largely due to COVID-related precautions including social distancing affecting flu rates. Flu activity rose during the 2021-2022 flu season, but preliminary estimates from the CDC show that there were fewer hospitalizations and deaths than in previous flu seasons. The 2022-2023 year was similar to flu seasons prior to the pandemic. It also peaked earlier in the season than previous years. Classified as moderately severe, the season resulted in an estimated 31 million symptomatic illnesses, 360,000 hospitalizations, and 21,000 deaths due to the flu. The 2023-2024 season closely mimicked the year before. As some of the COVID-related precautions have been lowered since then, researchers predict upcoming flu seasons to be more severe. Summary Influenza is primarily spread through airborne transmission via aerosols. These tiny particles are released when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks and can float through the air for a long time. However, research indicates that some transmission of the flu happens from coming into contact with an infected surface. Many of the same precautions that people have adopted to prevent the spread of COVID can also reduce your risk of spreading or contracting influenza, such as getting vaccinated and frequently washing your hands. Scientists are still studying how, precisely, the flu is spread. However, they know that 10 Sources Verywell Health uses only high-quality sources, including peer-reviewed studies, to support the facts within our articles.

Rapid communication: Effectiveness of influenza vaccines in children aged 6 to 59 months: a test-negative case–control study at primary care and hospital level, Spain 2023/24. Image Credit: Billion Photos / Shutterstock A Spanish study investigating the effectiveness of influenza vaccination in children finds that the vaccine is highly effective in preventing influenza infection and related hospitalization. The study is published in the journal Eurosurveillance. Background Global estimates indicate that influenza infections affect 109 million infants aged 0 to 59 months yearly. Both younger and older age groups are highly susceptible to developing severe influenza infections. Comparison to international data: The study’s findings are comparable with interim results from the 2023/24 flu season in Europe and North America, where similar effectiveness was observed against A(H1N1)pdm09, although the effectiveness against H3N2 was consistently low across regions In Spain, children under five and older adults aged 65 years or above have the highest rates of influenza-related hospitalization. Regarding virus transmission, evidence indicates that children play a key role in the community circulation of the virus and in the amplification of influenza epidemics. For the first time at the national level, influenza vaccination has been recommended for all children aged 6 to 59 months during the 2023-2024 season. In this study, scientists estimated the effectiveness of influenza vaccination against acute respiratory infection in children attending primary care or against severe acute respiratory infections in hospitalized children. Study Design The study analyzed data collected from the Surveillance System of Acute Respiratory Infections in Spain (SiVIRA), which monitors acute respiratory infections at the primary care level and severe acute respiratory infections at the hospital level. This test-negative case-control study analyzed SiVIRA data from 12 regions and 27 hospitals in Spain. Children who tested positive for the influenza virus were regarded as cases, and test-negative children were regarded as controls. Important Observations The study population included a total of 244 cases and 1,120 controls in primary care and 48 cases and 254 controls in hospitals. The influenza vaccination coverage was significantly higher among controls compared to that among cases in primary care. In both primary care and hospitals, influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 was the dominant subtype, followed by the influenza A (H3N2) subtype. Influenza B had very low circulation, reducing the ability to estimate vaccine effectiveness for this virus. Effectiveness of Influenza Vaccination The effectiveness of influenza vaccination was estimated by virus type, subtype, or clade. Potential confounding factors, including sex, age, epidemiological week, presence of chronic conditions, and region or hospital for acute or severe respiratory infections, were adjusted in the analysis. Number of paediatric cases and controlsa selected in the study by week and type/subtype of influenza among A) patients from primary care with acute respiratory infections (ARI), and B) hospitalised patients with severe ARI (SARI), and by age in months among C) ARI and D) SARI, Spain, September 2023–June 2024 (n = 27 hospitals in 12 regions) The effectiveness of influenza vaccination was estimated to be 70% against any influenza infection among children with acute respiratory infections in primary care. The vaccine efficacy against the influenza A H1N1 pdm09 subtype and the clade 5a.2a was 77% and 96%, respectively. However, no significant protective efficacy was observed against the influenza A H3N2 subtype or other clades, which could be attributed to the limited number of cases and the extremely wide confidence interval (the range of probable values of a given parameter). The effectiveness of influenza vaccination was estimated to be 77% against any influenza infection among hospitalized children with severe acute respiratory infections. The study was unable to accurately estimate vaccine efficacy by subtype or clade among hospitalized children because of an insufficient sample size, particularly for H3N2, which led to imprecise estimates. A sensitivity analysis was conducted including controls positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). This changed the vaccine efficacy to 68% against any influenza infection, 76% against the influenza A H1N1 pdm09 subtype, and 2% against the influenza A H3N2 subtype in primary care. In hospitals, the vaccine efficacy changed to 76%, 78%, and 19% against any influenza infection, influenza A H1N1 pdm09 subtype, and influenza A H3N2 subtype, respectively. In this analysis, the low efficacy against H3N2 remained, further emphasizing the challenges in drawing firm conclusions for this subtype due to the small sample size. Another set of sensitivity analyses was conducted by categorizing unknown vaccination status as unvaccinated. This changed the vaccine efficacy in hospitals to 86% and 76% against any influenza infection and influenza A H1N1 pdm09 subtype, respectively. The vaccine efficacy against influenza A H3N2 subtype became negative (-7%). This negative result highlights the difficulties in interpreting vaccine effectiveness when dealing with small sample sizes and low circulation of specific subtypes, like H3N2. In the second sensitivity analysis, no change in vaccine efficacy was observed in primary care settings. Study Significance The study finds that influenza vaccination is highly effective in preventing influenza infection and related hospitalization among children aged 6 to 59 months. However, the study acknowledges the limitations in the precision of its findings, particularly regarding the influenza A H3N2 subtype and the influenza B virus, which had very low circulation. The study finds a relatively lower vaccine efficacy against the clade 5a.2a.1. Existing evidence indicates that a mutation in the 2023-2024 clade 5a.2a.1 vaccine high-growth reassortant may be responsible for reduced vaccine efficacy. This mutation has been found to affect only the high-growth reassortant used for egg-based vaccines. This indicates that comparing vaccine efficacy between different vaccine brands against the same clade could provide more information. Considering the study observations, scientists highlight the need for continuous efforts to increase influenza vaccine coverage in future seasons among children belonging to this age group.

Avian influenza A H5N1 viruses under an electron microscope. Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images CNN — A third farmworker has tested positive for bird flu in California, according to the state’s health department. If confirmed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, this would be the 17th human case of H5N1 flu in the US since March, when the virus was first detected in cows. It comes as farmers and veterinarians in California are warning that the infection seems to be striking herds more severely than it has in other states, leading to higher percentages of sick and dead cows in affected herds. There are no signs of more serious illness in people. Like the first two human cases in California, this third case involves a farmworker who was in contact with sick dairy cattle. Investigators don’t see any connections between the most recent case and either of the first two, suggesting that this is another instance of animal-to-human transmission, the California Department of Public Health said in a news release. In all three cases, symptoms were mild and involved red, bloodshot eyes, a sign of conjunctivitis. Avian influenza research DigicomPhoto/Science Photo Library/Getty Images Related article Colorado bird flu cases show how extreme heat may be complicating efforts to control the virus The CDC’s principal deputy director, Dr. Nirav Shah, said Friday that these cases were not a surprise. “Additional cases may continue to be found as additional herds continue to test positive,” Shah said. While public health officials are taking the infections in stride, outside experts say each new human infection is a sign that the outbreak is not under control and that the people who are working with cattle and other sick animals are not being adequately protected. “These reports only increase my worries that this virus, if left unchecked will cause severe harms to human health,” said Dr. Jennifer Nuzzo, who directs the Pandemic Center at Brown University. “Many people have been far too dismissive of the threat posed by H5N1 on farms, wrongly assured by a handful of cases that have been mild. But epidemiologists know that the more people who become infected, the more likely we will see severe outcomes,” Nuzzo wrote in an email. “I have seen little that abates my worry that this virus will eventually cause hospitalizations or deaths,” she added Dozens of California herds affected Since late August, more than 80 herds in California have been affected by bird flu, according to the latest update from US Department of Agriculture. California is the nation’s largest milk producer. The California Department of Food and Agriculture has been conducting bulk milk tank sampling in areas where herds test positive. As in Colorado, where bulk milk tank testing was mandated by the state, the testing has helped quickly identify more affected herds, said Dr. Eric Deeble, acting senior adviser for the USDA’s H5N1 response. H5N1 bird flu has been identified in a farmworker in California for the first time. CDC/NIAID Related article Two California farmworkers test positive for bird flu Deeble said the USDA has sent a strike team to help California track the outbreak as it expands, and the state is looking for ways to expand its milk testing beyond the areas with known infections. Even as investigators are ramping up their efforts to follow the spread of the virus in California, farmers there are warning that the H5N1 infection in their herds is more severe than previously reported. In other states, about 10% of cows in an affected herd have shown symptoms, resulting in the death of less than 2% of the animals, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association. In contrast, dairy farms in California are reporting that the virus is infecting 50% to 60% of their herds, and 10% to 15% of the cows are dying from their infections, according to the California Dairy Quality Assurance Program. The higher infection and fatality rates in California were first reported by the Los Angeles Times. The increase in severity of cases has raised questions for scientists who are wondering whether environmental factors, such as heat, may be playing a role or if maybe the virus is changing as it adapts to cows and is causing more severe infections. Scientists would better be able to tell if genetic changes to the virus might be playing a role, they say, if state and federal officials would publicly share more information about the genetics of the viruses they’re finding and do it more quickly. The first infected herds in California were found in late August. On Monday, the CDC shared the gene sequences of viruses isolated from the first two farm workers in the state to test positive to a widely used data sharing site called GISAID.

In the same database, there are also what seem to be recently shared sequences from dairy cattle in the United States, shared by the USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, but these sequences are missing vital information needed to place them in the context of the larger outbreak, including what state they came from and the date they were collected. The USDA says it continues to follow the same process it has throughout the outbreak, uploading raw sequences on Fridays, as they become available and often within two weeks of the sample’s collection. The agency adds more information about the sample, including the state where it was collected and the collection date, after the epidemiological investigation has been completed, about six weeks later. Other countries, including some in Africa, operating with basic equipment and minimal resources, share the sequences of viruses within days and usually with more information than is being provided by the USDA, a spokesperson for GISAID told CNN. Without this information, it’s difficult for scientists to be able to follow the evolution of the virus and understand whether it is changing to become a more serious threat.

(Photo by Stephen Ausmus/Animal Research Services, USDA) WASHINGTON — The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention should have results later this month that provide more insight into how a Missouri resident, who hadn’t had any contact with infected animals or food, contracted a case of highly pathogenic avian influenza. Demetre Daskalakis, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the CDC, said on a call with reporters Friday the agency is working through its investigation of that bird flu case, while providing several more details. “As we previously reported, CDC would be able to perform partial sequencing of the avian influenza H5 virus from the case in Missouri, despite a nearly undetectable level of viral RNA in the patient sample,” Daskalakis said. That process is complex and time-consuming, in part because the patient had rather small amounts of the virus in their system when the test was taken. Another contributing factor, he said, is “that the virus has two potentially important mutations, meaning two amino acid differences, in comparison with the viruses previously characterized during this event that could affect antigenicity.” Daskalakis explained that antigenicity is when someone is able to produce “a specific immune response, such as creation of specific antibodies.” Both the mutations and small sample size have presented challenges for the CDC, but the agency expects to announce results of the test later this month after completing the complicated lab process, he said. Two cases in California The Missouri case is the only bird flu diagnosis in the United States this year where the person hadn’t had direct contact with infected poultry or dairy cattle. The remainder of the 16 people diagnosed with H5N1 during this calendar year had direct contact with farm animals, with nine of those cases linked to poultry and six related to dairy cows. One of those cases was diagnosed in Texas, two in Michigan, two in California just this week and 10 in Colorado. Public health officials on the call emphasized that the risk to the general public remains low and that several studies undertaken by the Food and Drug Administration show pasteurized dairy products as well as other foods remain safe to eat. Since February, the CDC has tested more than 50,000 samples that would have “detected Influenza A, H5 or other novel influenza viruses,” Daskalakis said. The Missouri case was the first case of bird flu detected through that influenza surveillance system, he said. Public health officials at the state and federal level have been trying to determine how the Missouri patient, who officials are not identifying for their privacy, contracted the virus through a series of “intense interviews,” Daskalakis said. That is how they learned someone living in the same house had been symptomatic with various gastrointestinal issues at the same time the patient had been ill. That simultaneous onset of symptoms implied “a common exposure, rather than human-to-human transmission,” Daskalakis said, before reinforcing that the second person never tested positive for the virus and isn’t considered a case of bird flu. “At the time of the interview, the household contact had also completely recovered and had not been tested for influenza while they were sick,” he said. “To be clear, there is only one case of H5N1 influenza detected in Missouri.” Because the person living in the same house as the Missouri patient had been symptom-free for more than 10 days when they were interviewed by public health officials, Daskalakis said there was “no utility in testing the contact for acute influenza.” Instead, officials in Missouri took blood samples from the two people so the CDC could test for “antibodies against H5 to assess for possible infection with this virus,” he said. A separate investigation was taken at the hospital where the Missouri patient had been diagnosed to see if any health care workers had contracted H5N1. Out of 118 health care workers who interacted with the patient in some way, 18 had higher-risk interactions before the patient was diagnosed and began using what Daskalakis referred to as “droplet precautions.” Six of those health care workers later developed respiratory symptoms, though only one of them had symptoms by the time the public health investigation had begun retroactively, he said. That one person’s PCR test for acute influenza came back negative and the other five health care workers, who had recovered, did not require a PCR test, he said. “Since exposures could only be assessed retrospectively, Missouri has also obtained blood specimens from these individuals for antibody or serology testing at CDC to search for any evidence to support the unlikely possibility that their symptoms were related to H5 infection resulting from their interaction with the patient,” Daskalakis said. “Despite the low risk, this testing is important to complete the public health investigation of this case.” The CDC began working on that serology testing in mid-September when it received the samples from Missouri, though the complicated process likely won’t conclude until later in October. “For serology testing to be conclusive, it needs to be done using a virus that is genetically identical to the one obtained from the human case from Missouri or there is a risk of a false negative test,” Daskalakis said. “Since this H5 virus was not recoverable, we could not grow it because there was not enough for the Missouri specimen.” The CDC, he explained, has to “create the right virus for the test using reverse genetics to match the one from Missouri, so that we can use it in these serology tests.” “We realize people, including all of us at CDC, are anxious to see results from this testing,” he said. “CDC is moving at a very accelerated pace while conducting rigorous science to assure the validity of these results.” Poultry, dairy cases In addition to human cases, bird flu continues to infect poultry flocks and dairy herds within the United States. While the poultry industry has had years of experience supplying its workers with personal protective equipment and culling affected farms, the dairy industry has had to figure out how to address the virus this year. Eric Deeble, deputy under secretary for marketing and regulatory programs at USDA, said on the call Friday that Colorado’s mandatory testing program of bulk milk tanks, which began in July, offered a hopeful case study for ridding farms throughout the country of H5N1. “Initially, this revealed a significant local prevalence, about 72% of dairies, centered in Weld County,” Deeble said. But following months of hard work by farmers and public health officials, Colorado has just one dairy herd that’s currently affected by H5N1 out of 86 dairy herds within the state, he said. “Mandatory surveillance in the state allows for continuous monitoring of herds and helps detect any instances of non-negative results early on, ensuring timely intervention,” Deeble said. “This decrease in Colorado cases, even in the absence of a vaccine, gives us further confidence that H5N1 can be eliminated in the national herd, even in places where we have seen an initial rapid increase in cases.” Data from the USDA show that during the past month, three dairy herds in Idaho and 53 in California have tested positive for H5N1.

Comparative study on epidemic characteristics, clinical features and costs of cases who infected RSV alone and influenza alone were conducted.ResultsAmong 1,894 cases included, the RSV positivity rate was 5.91% during the 2023–2024 winter-spring season, while the influenza positivity rate was 9.61%. RSV-B was the predominant subtype of RSV, and influenza A (primarily H3N2) was the dominant strain among the influenza-positive cases. Compared with cases infected influenza virus alone, those infected RSV alone had lower occurrence frequency of fever (18.8% vs. 35.7%, P = 0.004), higher occurrence frequency of complications of lower respiratory tract infections (70.8% vs. 54.8%, P = 0.011), higher direct medical costs ($996.2 vs. $841.1, P = 0.017) and total costs ($1019.7 vs. $888.1, P = 0.036). RSV single infection is more common in female cases (P = 0.007) and diabetic cases (P = 0.007) than influenza virus single infection.ConclusionsDuring the winter and spring months, RSV is the second most common pathogen after influenza virus among older adults hospitalized for respiratory infections in Suzhou, China. Patients infected RSV are more likely to develop complications with lower respiratory tract infections and have higher medical costs than the influenza. RSV infection in the elderly should be emphasized, especially in female patients and diabetic patients. Peer Review reports Introduction Acute respiratory infection (ARI) is a syndrome characterized by fever, cough, sore throat, and other symptoms of respiratory tract infection. Influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are common pathogens [1, 2]. RSV is a pathogen that primarily affects the respiratory system, causing upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) and lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). Among these, lower respiratory tract infections include pneumonia, bronchitis, and bronchiectasis [3]. Children, individuals aged 60 and older, and those with compromised immune systems are more susceptible to RSV lower respiratory infections, which can be severe and even fatal. However, RSV, known primarily for its high prevalence in infants and young children, has received less attention in the elderly [4, 5]. Its impact on the elderly has not been emphasized until recent years, although it is now increasingly recognized as an important pathogen causing severe respiratory disease in the elderly and those with underlying comorbidities [6]. Globally, the severity and disease burden of RSV in older adults can be comparable to that of influenza [7, 8]. However, epidemiologic data for the elderly population are very limited compared to the extensive RSV-related literature for infants and young children. Notably, misdiagnosed or unrecognized RSV infections may lead to an underestimation of the RSV burden due to the similarity of the clinical manifestations of RSV and influenza. Studies have noted that 10-31% of adult RSV patients require intensive care, 3-17% require mechanical ventilation, and mortality can be 6-8% [9]. In a population-based study examining the proportion of acute respiratory illnesses caused by RSV and estimating the burden of disease in older adults, Nicholson et al. calculated that the incidence of wintertime respiratory illnesses caused by RSV exceeded that of nonpandemic influenza [10, 11]. These findings underscore the urgency of increased attention to RSV infection in older adults.Therefore, this study conducted a 6-month pathogen surveillance of respiratory tract infections in the elderly in Suzhou City, China, to investigate the prevalence characteristics and proportion of RSV infections among the elderly, compare RSV and influenza virus infections in terms of clinical characteristics and disease burden, elucidate the hazards of RSV-associated respiratory infections on the health of the elderly population, and provide a basis for the development of RSV-associated preventive strategies.Materials and methodsSurveillance and case definitionIn this study, we collected clinical data from elderly patients aged 60 years and older who were hospitalized due to ARI at five hospitals in Suzhou City (Suzhou Ninth People’s Hospital, The People’s Hospital of SND, Suzhou Changshu Xinzhuang People’s Hospital, Zhangjiagang Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, and The First People’s Hospital of Kunshan) and conducted pathogenicity testing from December 1, 2023, to May 31, 2024. The WHO and European case definitions of ARI for RSV infection surveillance were used: acute onset (within 10 days) with symptoms of respiratory infection (at least one symptom: cough, sore throat, shortness of breath, or runny nose) [12, 13]. MethodsStudy design and data collectionThis study was a prospective, multicenter study employing stratified whole cluster sampling. Stratified sampling was conducted by county and district, involving 3 counties in Suzhou (Zhangjiagang City, Changshu City, and Kunshan City) and 2 districts (Wujiang and Huqiu). Hospital-level stratified sampling included 3 tertiary hospitals: Suzhou Ninth People’s Hospital, Zhangjiagang Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, and The First People’s Hospital of Kunshan; and 2 secondary hospitals: The People’s Hospital of SND and Suzhou Changshu Xinzhuang People’s Hospital. The sampled hospitals collected and sent samples for testing from all elderly patients hospitalized for acute respiratory infections. See Fig. 1.Fig. 1Flowchart of the studyFull size imageThe study used a self-designed survey form to collect case information, including: (1) demographic information (age, gender); (2) clinical information: clinical symptoms, underlying diseases, date of admission, date of discharge, discharge diagnosis, and hospitalization costs; (3) patient outcomes: including whether the patient died during the hospitalization period, time of death, whether they were admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU), and time of ICU admission; and (4) economic burden: including direct medical costs (comprehensive medical services, diagnosis, treatment, medication, and consumables), direct non-medical costs (transportation and escort costs), and indirect costs (lost labor costs due to patient and family accompaniment). These data were obtained through the hospital information system and patient questionnaires. The questionnaire was developed specifically for this study to assess the epidemiological characteristics, clinical characteristics and disease burden of RSV and influenza in older adults (see Supplementary Material 1 and Supplementary Material 2 for the English version).Sample collection and laboratory testsRespiratory samples (nasal swabs) were collected by local hospital professionals during the study participants’ visits to the clinic or hospitalization, following standard sampling procedures. The samples were placed in tubes containing viral sampling solution and stored in a refrigerator at 2–8℃ (for up to 48 h) or at -20℃ (for up to 1 week). Influenza Novel Coronavirus Respiratory 13 Pathogen Nucleic Acid Test Kit (Fluorescent PCR method) (Jiangsu Bioperfectus Technologies Co., Ltd.) and real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR were used to detect pathogens such as Respiratory syncytial virus, Influenza virus, Human adenovirus (HAdV), Human rhinovirus (HRV), Human parainfluenza virus (HPIV), Human coronavirus (HCoV, Not including COVID-19), Human metapneumovirus (HMPV), Chlamydia pneumoniae (CP), Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP), Human bocavirus (HBoV), Enterovirus (EV), and other pathogens. RSV-positive specimens were subtyped using the Duplex Real-Time PCR Diagnostic Kit for Rapid Detection of respiratory syncytial viruses A/B (Beijing Zhuocheng Huisheng Biotechnology Co.). Similarly, Influenza A-positive specimens were subtyped using the Duplex Real-Time PCR Diagnostic Kit for Rapid Subtyping of Human Influenza A Viruses (Beijing Zhuocheng Huisheng Biotechnology Co.).Statistical methodsExcel 2019 software was used to summarize the data, and R 4.3.1 software was applied to process and analyze the data. The study subjects were divided into RSV single and influenza single infection groups for comparison. Continuous variables are presented in mean and standard deviation (SD) and compared by independent-samples t-test. Counting variables are presented in medians and interquartile ranges (IQR) and analyzed by Nonparametric test. The chi-square (χ2) test or Fisher’s exact test was used for count data. A P-value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.ResultsPathogen infections of respiratory tract infections in the elderlyRSV and influenza infections in the elderlyFrom December 1, 2023, to May 31, 2024, a total of 1,894 cases of respiratory infections were investigated among the elderly in Suzhou City, with 455 testing positive for pathogens, yielding a positivity rate of 24.0%. Of these, 409 were infected with one pathogen, 42 with two, and four with three. The five pathogens with the highest detection rates were influenza virus (9.61%, 182/1,894), RSV (5.91%, 112/1,894), HRV (3.12%, 59/1,894), SP (2.96%, 56/1,894), and HMVP (1.58%, 30/1,894) (see Fig. 2). Influenza virus accounted for the highest percentage of positive pathogens (36.0%, 182/505), followed by RSV (22.2%, 112/505), HRV (11.7%, 59/505), SP (11.1%, 56/505), and HMVP (5.9%, 30/505) (see Fig. 2).Fig. 2Proportion of pathogenic infections and positive detection of common pathogens of respiratory tract infections among the elderly in Suzhou City, ChinaFull size imageAmong influenza virus infections, single infection accounted for 86.3% (157/182), double infections for 12.1% (22/182), and multiple infections for 1.6% (3/182). For RSV infections, single infection comprised 85.7% (96/112), double infections 11.6% (13/112), and multiple infections 2.7% (3/112) (see Fig. 3). Among influenza virus infections, influenza A accounted for 76.4% (139/182) and influenza B for 23.6% (43/182). Of the influenza A cases, 9.4% (n = 13) were H1N1, and 88.5% (n = 123) were H3N2, with no subtyping data available for 3 isolates. For RSV infections, subtypes were identified in 49.1% of patients (55/112). Among those with identified subtypes, RSV-A accounted for 18.2% (10/55) and RSV-B for 81.8% (45/55) (see Fig. 3). Fig. 3Types of Influenza and RSV infection, and pathogen typing in elderly people in Suzhou City, ChinaFull size imageRSV and influenza epidemic characteristicsInfluenza positivity was highest in December and then showed a significant month-to-month decline (χ2trend = 101.27, P < 0.05). RSV positivity was significantly lower than influenza in December, but spiked to a peak in January and then declined month-to-month (χ2trend = 9.84, P < 0.05). Overall, influenza positivity rates were higher than RSV positivity rates from December to February, but from March to May, RSV positivity rates were higher than influenza positivity rates (see Fig. 4). Fig. 4Distribution of the time of onset of RSV and influenza virus-associated respiratory infections in older adultsFull size imageComparison of the basic information of RSV single and influenza virus single infection casesThe patients in both groups were mainly concentrated in the age group of 70–79 years. The mean age of those infected with RSV alone was 75.4 ± 7.6 years, while that of those infected with influenza virus alone was 75.7 ± 8.1 years.RSV infections were 43.8% (42/96) in males and 56.2% (64/96) in females; influenza infections were 61.1% (96/157) in males and 38.9% (61/157) in females. The proportion of females infected with RSV was greater than that of influenza, and the difference was statistically significant (P = 0.007). RSV infections were more prevalent in the county-level city than influenza (69.8% vs. 56.7%), and the difference was statistically significant (P = 0.038).Among the underlying diseases, 20.8% (20/96) of RSV-infected and 8.9% (14/157) of influenza-infected patients had diabetes, a difference that was statistically significant (P = 0.007). The difference between the two groups was not statistically significant for cardiovascular disease (62.5% vs. 57.3%), chronic respiratory disease (50.0% vs. 40.8%), and cancer (6.3% vs. 1.3%) (see Table 1). Table 1 Basic characteristics of cases of respiratory syncytial virus and influenza virus-associated respiratory infections in the elderly [n (%)]Full size tableComparison of the clinical features of RSV single and influenza virus single infection casesThe most common symptoms of RSV infection in elderly patients infected with RSV alone at the time of admission were cough (96.9%), followed by sputum production (62.5%), dyspnea (29.2%), fever (18.8%), shortness of breath (18.8%), wheezing (15.6%), runny nose (11.5%), and sore throat (10.4%). The most common symptom of influenza virus infection was cough (94.3%), followed by sputum production (52.9%), fever (35.7%), dyspnea (24.2%), wheezing (21.7%), shortness of breath (14.6%), sore throat (14.0%), and runny nose (13.4%). The proportion of fever was lower in RSV-infected elderly patients (18.8%) compared to those with influenza virus infection (35.7%) (P = 0.003). RSV infection led to LRTI complications (pneumonia, bronchiolitis) in 70.8% (68/96) of cases, while influenza virus infection led to LRTI complications in 54.8% (86/157) of cases, and the difference was statistically significant (P = 0.011) (see Table 2). Table 2 Comparison of clinical characteristics of hospitalized cases of respiratory syncytial virus and influenza virus-associated respiratory infections in the elderly [n (%)]Full size tableThere was no statistically significant difference between RSV-infected cases and those with influenza virus infection in terms of oxygen saturation, ICU admissions, days of hospitalization, and discharge outcomes (see Table 2).Comparison of the economic burden of disease in RSV single and influenza virus single infection casesThe direct medical costs were $996.2 (792.0-1324.7) for RSV-infected cases and $841.1(574.5-1335.9) for influenza virus-infected cases, which was statistically higher for RSV infection than for influenza virus infection (P = 0.017). The difference in direct non-medical costs and indirect costs of RSV infection compared to influenza virus infection was not statistically significant (see Table 3). Table 3 Comparison of hospitalization costs for hospitalized cases of respiratory syncytial virus and influenza virus-associated respiratory infections in the elderly [M(IQR), $]Full size tableThe total economic burden of RSV infection was higher than influenza virus infection ($1019.7 vs. $888.1), and the difference was statistically significant (P = 0.036) (see Table 3).DiscussionDuring the winter and spring seasons of 2023–2024, respiratory infections among older adults in Suzhou City, China, were predominantly caused by single-pathogen infections, with influenza virus being the most common. Influenza A was the main pathogen, with H3N2 identified as the dominant subtype. This aligns with findings by André Almeida et al., who reported H3N2 as the predominant influenza A subtype in elderly populations [14]. Similarly, a study by Sara Carazo et al. found that influenza A (H3N2) was associated with a higher risk of hospitalization compared to influenza A (H1N1) and influenza B [15]. Therefore, subtype surveillance is crucial for monitoring influenza infections in the elderly. After the COVID-19 pandemic onset and the introduction of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) there was evidence of the absolute predominance of RSV-A [16]. However, in the present study, RSV-B emerged as the dominant subtype, potentially signaling a return to the previous pattern of co-circulation of RSV-A and RSV-B.Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the implementation of corresponding NPIs, the rate of respiratory pathogen infections has been significantly impacted [17]. RSV has been found to be more susceptible to NPIs than influenza viruses [17]. One study showed that the incidence of RSV infections was significantly lower during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the pre-pandemic period [18]. The RSV positivity rate among older adults in Beijing, China, decreased significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic, reaching its lowest level in 9 years [19]. In Shenzhen, China, the RSV positivity rate in January 2023 was even 0% [20]. However, after the end of the COVID-19 pandemic, RSV positivity among older adults in Beijing exceeded both pre-pandemic and pandemic levels, peaking in December 2023 at its highest level in 9 years [19]. This study also found that the RSV positivity rate in the Suzhou area peaked in January 2024 and lasted longer compared to influenza. Although both positivity rates declined after the winter peak, the decrease in RSV was more gradual, and its positivity rate exceeded that of influenza from March to May. These findings suggest that following the COVID-19 pandemic and the lifting of NPIs, RSV has resumed its typical transmission pattern.This study of respiratory pathogen surveillance in older adults over a 6-month period suggests that the health risks of RSV infection in this population cannot be ignored. Results from a population-wide ARI prospective surveillance in China, conducted from 2009 to 2019, showed that RSV ranked 5th among the 8 pathogens monitored, with a det ection rate of 7.4% [21]. Among the pathogens monitored in our study, the detection percentage of RSV ranked 2nd, only behind influenza, and was higher than in the 2009–2019 study. This suggests that RSV constitutes a significant proportion of respiratory infections in elderly individuals in Suzhou and is one of the most important pathogens causing respiratory infections in this population.Clinical symptom of RSV infection are similar to those of other viral respiratory pathogens and include cough (more than 90%), nasal congestion and runny nose (22-78%), sore throat (16-64%), and dyspnea (51-93%) [22]. Differentiating RSV infection from influenza virus infection can be challenging without laboratory pathogenetic tests. Although there is significant symptom overlap, studies have found that influenza virus infections are more likely to present with fever (temperature ≥ 38℃) [23], whereas RSV infections are often non-febrile or present with only a low-grade fever [24]. Additionally, RSV infections are more commonly associated with symptoms of runny nose and wheezing compared to influenza, while fever over 38℃ is more frequently observed in influenza infections [13, 25,26,27]. This study did not find any significant difference between RSV and influenza in terms of symptoms such as runny nose and wheezing. However, a notable difference was observed regarding fever. Fewer individuals with RSV infection experienced fever compared to those with influenza virus infection, and RSV infections more commonly presented with a low-grade fever. This characteristic may be useful for differentiating between RSV and influenza virus infections.An interesting finding in this study is that the proportion of females infected with RSV is higher than that of females infected with influenza. A related study indicated that the risk of RSV infection in females may be greater compared to influenza [28]. This may be due to females spending more time with young children, who have a high prevalence of RSV, thereby indirectly increasing the risk of infection. Additionally, previous studies have shown that gender plays a key role in the incidence, immune response, and severity of ARI [29,30,31]. Therefore, the impact of RSV infection in females warrants particular attention.The study reported by Hakan Sivgin et al. revealed that heart failure, hypertension, and diabetes were the underlying conditions associated with the highest risk of RSV hospitalization, with all severe cases in their study involving patients with diabetes [32]. Diabetes and hypertension are established risk factors for RSV, as reported in several prior studies [33,34,35]. Additionally, previous research has shown that adults hospitalized for RSV tend to be slightly older and have a higher prevalence of underlying medical conditions, particularly cardiopulmonary diseases, compared to those hospitalized for influenza virus infection [36,37,38]. Our study also found that a higher proportion of patients with diabetes were infected with RSV compared to those infected with influenza virus. Although no significant differences were observed between RSV and influenza in patients with hypertension and chronic respiratory disease, a higher proportion of patients hospitalized with RSV had hypertension (62.5% vs. 57.3%) and chronic respiratory disease (50.0% vs. 40.8%) compared to those hospitalized with influenza. Therefore, greater attention should be given to RSV patients with underlying conditions, especially those with diabetes.Our study found that the length of hospitalization for RSV was similar to that for influenza, consistent with previous research [36, 37]. Despite similar hospitalization durations, the financial burden for older patients hospitalized with RSV was higher than for those with influenza. This finding is mentioned in a study by Bradley Ackerson et al., which reported that the medical costs for hospitalized RSV infected cases in individuals over 60 years of age were higher than those for influenza infected cases ($16,034 versus $15,163) [39]. RSV has long been recognized as a significant cause of severe illness in children, but many healthcare professionals may not fully appreciate that RSV is also a major pathogen responsible for the hospitalization of elderly patients with respiratory tract infections [22, 40, 41]. Both RSV and influenza virus infections exhibit seasonal epidemics during winter and spring, with overlapping time frames [42, 43]. The seasonal overlap, coupled with the infrequent use of RSV pathogen testing in clinical settings, likely contributes to the under-recognition of RSV infection risk among the elderly in previous studies. Unlike viruses for which effective vaccines and specific antiviral medicine are available, such as the influenza virus [44], there are currently no specific and effective treatments or interventions for RSV infection in China. This may partly explain why the disease burden of hospitalized elderly patients with RSV infection was higher than that of influenza virus infection in this study. Therefore, the significant disease burden of RSV infection in the elderly should not be overlooked.RSV can cause severe lower respiratory tract infections in the elderly, potentially leading to respiratory failure and high mortality. Studies have shown that over 70% of RSV patients experience severe lower respiratory complications, including pneumonia and acute bronchitis [45, 46]. Our study also found that 70.8% of RSV-infected patients developed LRTI complications. An observational, retrospective cohort study by Ackerson et al. compared mortality and morbidity among adults aged ≥ 60 years hospitalized for RSV infection (n = 645) versus influenza (n = 1,878). The study found that RSV-infected individuals had a 2.7-fold higher risk of pneumonia (P < 0.001) compared to those with influenza, along with longer hospital stays and higher mortality rates [38]. A study by Ann R. Falsey et al. demonstrated that RSV positivity was more likely to result in hospitalization compared to other viral respiratory infections [13]. Similarly, Lee et al. found that hospitalized patients with RSV in Hong Kong were more likely to develop LRTI than those with influenza [37]. This finding is consistent with our study, which observed a higher proportion of LRTI complications among RSV-infected older adults (70.8%) compared to those with influenza (54.7%). Thus, RSV infection in the elderly may lead to more severe disease outcomes, which helps explain the higher economic burden of RSV compared to influenza in this study.This study has several limitations. First, monitoring was conducted over a six-month period, and a full year of data collection has yet to be completed. Second, the study population included only individuals aged 60 years and older, excluding those under 60 years. We will continue monitoring to achieve a full year of surveillance and plan to conduct population-wide RSV surveillance in the future.ConclusionsThe RSV epidemic in older adults in Suzhou City, China, occurs around the similar time as influenza and accounts for a significant proportion of respiratory infections in this population, with an economic burden comparable to that of influenza virus infection. RSV infections are more likely to lead to more serious lower respiratory complications than influenza infections. Therefore, establishing an RSV surveillance system should be prioritized to better monitor RSV infection in the elderly, particularly those with underlying conditions.

Virology Volume 15 - 2024 | https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2024.1482785 Ruhao Dashi granules exert therapeutic effects on H1N1 influenza virus infection by altering intestinal microflora composition Wei Pan†Rui Wu†Qianyun ZhangYuan MaJinxiang XiangJingbo Wang*Jing Chen* College of Life Science, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, China Objective: Antiviral medications for influenza could be ineffective due to the emergence of resistant influenza virus strains. Ruhao Dashi (RHDS) granules possess anti-inflammatory and antibacterial effects. The present study aimed to determine the efficacy of RHDS granules in treating influenza-infected mice and the mechanism underlying this treatment as well as its effect on the intestinal flora composition of the infected mice. Methods: The HPLC-UV method was used to identify the active components of RHDS granules. ICR mice were infected with influenza A virus (IAV) H1N1 subtype through a nasal drip. After the influenza mice model was successfully established, the pathological changes in the lungs were observed for 5 days after gavage treatment with 0.9% sterile saline and low, medium, and high doses (0.07, 0.14, and 0.28 g/mL, respectively) of RHDS granules. The serum levels of the cytokines IL-6 and TNF-α and sIgA were detected by ELISA. Real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR and western blotting assay were performed to determine the expression levels of the tight junction (TJ) proteins claudin-1, occludin, and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) in colon tissues. Furthermore, 16S rRNA gene sequencing of feces samples was conducted to assess the effect of RHDS granules on the gut microbiota. Results: RHDS granules exerted a protective effect on the lung tissues of IAV-infected mice; moreover, the granules reduced the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines and increased the relative expression levels of claudin-1, occludin, and ZO-1 in colon tissues. Furthermore, RHDS granule treatment increased the relative abundance of Lactobacillus, Akkermansia, and Faecalibaculum and decreased the relative abundance of Muribaculaceae; thus, RHDS granules could stabilize the intestinal microbiota to some extent. Conclusion: RHDS granules exert a therapeutic effect on IAV-infected mice probably by modifying the structural composition of their intestinal microbiota. 1 Introduction Influenza is a communicable respiratory tract infection caused by airborne influenza viruses and frequently occurs between the seasons of fall and early spring. The influenza virus causes mild to severe symptoms and is highly contagious (Keilman, 2019). Similar to acute febrile illness, influenza manifests as a range of systemic and respiratory symptoms such as runny nose, cough, chills, sore throat, malaise, and headache (Clohisey and Baillie, 2019). Influenza viruses evolve mainly through two mechanisms: antigenic transfer and antigenic drift. Co-infection of the same cells in an individual by two genetically distinct influenza virus strains results in swapping of their genomic segments. This recombination may lead to changes in the antigenic characteristics of the surface glycoproteins neuraminidase (NA) and hemagglutinin (HA); this phenomenon is referred to antigenic transfer (Kumari et al., 2023). In contrast, antigenic drift is a protracted process caused by the accumulation of mutations in viral surface proteins (Chen et al., 2022). HA, the most prevalent glycoprotein on the surface of influenza viruses, constantly undergoes changes to escape herd immunity induced by vaccination and spontaneous infection (Wu and Wilson, 2020; Wu and Wilson, 2017). NA inhibitors such as zanamivir and oseltamivir are frequently used to treat influenza. Although antiviral medications are the cornerstone of clinical treatment for influenza, their efficacy may be reduced or they may be rendered ineffective following the emergence of drug-resistant influenza viruses (Holmes et al., 2021). Hence, the development of strong antiviral medications is crucial to prevent and treat both seasonal and pandemic influenza virus infections. Each person has a unique gut microbiota, which makes it a complex ecological system (Altieri et al., 2023). The gut-lung axis, which implies a significant relationship between the gut microbiota and the lungs, has been reported by recent research (Zhang et al., 2020). Current studies on influenza virus medications have focused on developing new NA inhibitors and HA blockers. Some studies have shown that mice infected with the influenza virus exhibit substantial intestinal inflammation and damage of their gut barriers (Guo et al., 2024). Furthermore, previous studies have also shown that the dysregulation of the intestinal flora impairs the ability of mice to mount an effective immune response; moreover, the intestinal flora can mitigate the immunological damage sustained by mice after receiving antibiotics through the Toll-like receptor 7 signaling pathway (Ichinohe et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2013). Elevated levels of colonic MUC5AC and fecal lipid transport protein-2 following viral lung infections suggest low-grade intestinal inflammation (Groves et al., 2018). Therefore, the use of the enteropulmonary axis as an additional treatment approach for influenza could be a novel and potentially beneficial strategy. Ruhaodashi (RHDS) granules contain Moslae Herba, Amomum tsao-ko Crevost et Lemarié, Magnolia officinalis Rehd. et Wils, Lonicerae japonicae flos, Artemisia annua L., and Atractylodes Lancea (Thunb.) DC (Patent No. 202010234178.8). RHDS granules effectively disperse heat, generate moisture, and extract toxins. In clinical practice, therapy with RHDS granules has been shown to exert positive anti-inflammatory and antibacterial effects (Yi et al., 2023). However, it remains unknown whether RHDS granules can treat influenza by altering the intestinal flora. Therefore, in the present study, by using a pneumonia mice model infected with influenza A virus (IAV) subtype H1N1, we investigated how RHDS granules treat influenza by affecting the ecology and composition of the gut microbiota. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Materials 2.1.1 Experimental animals and viruses Fifty-six male ICR mice, weighing 18 ± 2 g, were purchased from Hangzhou Medical College, with a laboratory animal production license number SYXK (zhe) 2021–0001. The IAV strain A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) was donated by the Institute of Basic Medical Sciences and Oncology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and its 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) is 10–3.4. To avoid damage of the virus activity, the strain was stored properly at −80°C. Before each experiment, the appropriate amount of sample was removed as required to avoid repeated freezing and thawing. 2.1.2 Medicines and reagents RHDS granules were prepared by Harvest Pharmaceuticals Limited as packets containing 8 g of granules per packet. The granules were mixed with double-distilled water at a mass concentration of 10 mg/mL to form a stock solution. Bacterial contamination was removed by filtering the stock solution through a 0.22-μm filter membrane, and the filtered solution was stored at 4°C for later use. The remaining herbs and reagents are shown in Table 1. Table 1 Table 1. Experimental reagents and drugs. 2.1.3 Equipment The following equipment were used in this study: CFX384 multiplex qRT-PCR instrument (Bio-Rad, USA); low-temperature, high-speed freezing centrifuge (Eppendorf, Germany); ultraviolet spectrophotometer (Beckman, USA); protein electrophoresis and transfer system (Bio-Rad); 7890B GC system for gas chromatography (Agilent); 5977B MSD mass spectrometer (Agilent); QT-1 vortex tester (Shanghai Qite Analytical Instruments Co., Ltd.). UltiMate 3,000 high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system (including quaternary pump, injector, column oven, and UV detector; Thermo Scientific); Eclipse C18 column (4.6 × 150 mm, 5 μm, Agilent); electronic balance ME204E/02 (Mettler Toledo Instruments [SHANGHAI]); and KQ5200DE CNC ultrasonic cleaner (Kunshan Ultrasonic Instrument Co., Ltd.). 2.2 Methods 2.2.1 Particle liquid chromatography of RHDS granules 2.2.1.1 Chromatographic conditions The following chromatographic conditions were applied: column: Eclipse C18 column; mobile phase: 0.1% phosphoric acid-water (A)-acetonitrile (B); gradient elution: (0 ~ 10 min, 10% → 20% B; 10 ~ 35 min, 20% → 55% B; 35 ~ 50 min, 55% → 90% B; 50 ~ 60 min, 90% B; 60 ~ 61 min, 90% → 10% B; 61 ~ 70 min, 10% B); wavelength: 280 nm; column temperature: 25°C; flow rate: 0.7 mL/min; injection volume: 10 μL. 2.2.1.2 Preparation of mixed reference solutions Reference standards of chlorogenic acid, 3,5-O-dicaffeoylquinic acid, 4,5-di-O-caffeoylquinic acid, honokiol, magnolol, and atractylodin were weighed, and 75% methanol was added to each of them to dissolve and prepare mixed reference solutions with mass concentrations of 300, 600, 200, 600, 200, and 100 μg/mL, respectively. 2.2.1.3 Preparation of test solution Wet granules (0.75 g) containing Elsholtzia and Artemisia were weighed, and 25 mL of 75% methanol was added. After ultrasonic extraction for 1 h, the mixture was left to cool. The loss in the weight of the mixture was compensated with 75% methanol. The renewed filtrate was passed through a 0.22-μm microporous filtration membrane to obtain the test solution. 2.2.2 Subgroups, modeling, and interventions Mice were randomly assigned to the following treatment groups comprising 8 mice each: control; model; Tamiflu; Shuanghuanglian (SHL); and RHDS low, medium, and high dose (RHDS-L, RHDS-M, and RHDS-H, respectively). Except for the control group, mice in the other groups were anesthetized using a gas anesthesia machine with 20 mL isoflurane. The mice were challenged intranasally with 10 times the median lethal dose (MLD50) of IAV (Zhang et al., 2018). None of the infected mice died. The RHDS granule dose was 9.1fold that of the clinical dose used in humans (converted according to the average body surface area assuming a body mass of 70 kg) as determined by performing calculations based on the difference in body weight between humans and mice. The low, medium, and high doses of RHDS granules were set as 0.07, 0.14, and 0.28 g/mL, respectively. These doses were administered to the infected mice through gavage at 24 h after IAV infection. The treatment group received one gavage per day for 5 days. An equal amount of saline was administered to the control and model groups simultaneously. These treatment regimens were continuously administered throughout the experiment. 2.2.3 General observation and changes in lung and splenic indices Each day, the mice were monitored for signs of infection, food and water intake, hair color, and activity. Five days after the final treatment, the mice were sacrificed, and their lungs and spleen were collected; these were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, dried on filter paper, and weighed. The lung and splenic indices were calculated as follows: Lung index = weight of the lung ÷ body weight × 100 % . Splenic index = weight of the spleen ÷ body weight × 100 % . 2.2.4 Pathological changes in lung tissues Fresh lung tissues were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, dehydrated, paraffin-embedded, and cut into 4-μm-thick serial sections. The tissues were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), and the pathological changes in these tissues were observed under a light microscope. 2.2.5 ELISA for quantifying serum levels of the cytokines IL-6 and TNF-α and sIgA Mice blood samples were collected in endotoxin-and pyrogen-free tubes and allowed to clot for 30 min at room temperature. The samples were then centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min, and the serum was carefully separated. Next, 50 μL of standard and diluted samples was added to each microtiter well of a pre-coated enzyme plate. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated detection antibodies were then added to each well, and the plate was incubated for 60 min at room temperature. Subsequently, the wells were washed, a chromogenic substrate was added, and the plate was incubated for 15 min in the dark. Finally, color development was terminated, and the absorbance was measured at 450 nm within 30 min following the addition of the termination solution. 2.2.6 qRT-PCR for detecting the degree of change in viral titer in the lung tissue of mice infected with the IAV influenza virus To obtain a homogenate of lung tissue, a part of the tissue was ground, and the mixture was then centrifuged at 4,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C. Using GAPDH as the internal reference, the RNA concentration was ascertained and then computed using the 2-ΔΔCt technique by the directions of the Hifair® II 1st Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (see Table 2). Table 2 Table 2. Sequences of primers for viral titers. 2.2.7 qRT-PCR for determining the mRNA expression levels of the TJ proteins claudin-1, occludin, and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) in mucosal tissues To obtain the colon homogenate, a portion of the colon tissue was grounded and centrifuged at 4,000 g for 15 min at 4°C. In accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions, total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent, reverse transcribed into cDNA, and subjected to PCR amplification (PCR conditions: 95°C for 2 min, 95°C for 15 s, 62°C for 30 s, 72°C for 30 s, ×40 cycles). Each sample was analyzed in triplicate. GAPDH was used as the internal reference gene, and target gene expression was calculated relative to GAPDH expression by using the 2−ΔΔCt method. The primers are shown in Table 3. Table 3 Table 3. Primers for qRT-PCR. 2.2.8 Western blotting assay for measuring the relative expression levels of claudin-1, occludin, and ZO-1 in mucosal tissues A portion of mouse colon tissue was harvested and grounded by adding RIPA buffer. The grounded sample was centrifuged, and the supernatant was used as the total protein solution. The total protein extraction kit (containing a protease inhibitor cocktail) was used to extract the total protein. After measuring the protein concentration using the BCA kit, equal amounts of proteins (25 μg) were taken and separated by 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The separated proteins were then transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5% skimmed milk for 1 h at room temperature. Subsequently, the membrane was incubated with primary antibodies against occludin (1:1,000), claudin-1 (1:2,000), ZO-1 (1:500), and β-actin (1:10,000) at 4°C overnight. The membrane was then incubated with HRP-conjugated sheep anti-rabbit and sheep anti-mouse IgG secondary antibodies (1:5,000) for 1 h at room temperature. Subsequently, the enhanced chemiluminescence kit was used for color development, and the gray value of each band was measured by Image J software. The expression level of each target protein was calculated relative to that of β-actin as the internal reference protein. 2.2.9 High-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA gene sequences in enteric bacteria The colonic feces of each group were collected and stored in a refrigerator at −80°C. The 16S rRNA V3 ~ V4 regions were sequenced by Illumina MiSeq sequencing technology at Shanghai Parsonage Biotechnology Co. Alpha diversity analysis (Chao1 index, Shannon index, Simpson index, and Observed_species index), beta diversity analysis (distance matrix with principal coordinate analysis [PCoA] and non-metric multidimensional scaling [NMDS] analysis), and other analytical methods were used to obtain relevant information regarding changes in the gut microbiota composition. 2.3 Statistical analysis GraphPad Prism 8.0.1 and SPSS 22.0 were used for statistical analysis. The group comparisons were operated by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and T-test. p-value <0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. 3 Results 3.1 Particle liquid chromatography of RHDS granules Ten microliters of each of the control and test solutions were taken and injected into the sample, and the chromatogram was then recorded. The results showed that the retention time of the six components in the test solution was consistent with that of the control (Figure 1). The separation from the adjacent peaks was >1.0 under the condition, and the theoretical plate number was not less than 17,000 according to chlorogenic acid. Figure 1 Figure 1. HPLC plots of the test solution (A) and mixed control solution (B). 1: Chlorogenic acid; 2: 3,5-O-Dicaffeoylquinic acid; 3: 4,5-Di-O-caffeoylquinic acid; 4: Honokiol; 5: Magnolol; 6: Atractylodin. 3.2 Effects of RHDS granules on the general health state of mice and lung indices Mice in the control group had shiny coats, were energetic and mentally healthy, and had gained weight naturally. Within 1–2 days of IAV infection, mice in the infection group showed classic influenza symptoms, such as dull fur, arched backs, curled bodies, shortness of breath, and steady weight loss. Compared to the model group, the Tamiflu, RHDS-L, and RHDS-M groups exhibited a significant decrease in the symptoms of arched backs, shortness of breath, and dull fur. The differences in the body weight of mice in each group are shown in Figure 2A. Compared to the control group, the model group showed a significant increase in the lung index (p < 0.05) and a significant decrease in the splenic index (p < 0.05). Furthermore, compared to the model group, the SHL, Tamiflu, RHDS-L, and RHDS-M groups showed a significant decrease in the lung index (p < 0.05, p < 0.01, p < 0.01, and p < 0.01, respectively) and a significant increase in the splenic index (p < 0.01). As can be seen from the graph, RHDS with Tamiflu works better. Therefore, in this study, the Tamiflu and RHDS treatment groups were also statistically analyzed. The results of this study concluded that the RHDS low-dose group was closest to the Tamiflu group. (Figures 2B,C). Statistical analyses were conducted on the Tamiflu treatment group and the RHDS treatment group. The results of the study showed that the effect of the RHDS low-dose treatment group was closest to that of the Tamiflu treatment group.The results are shown in (Figures 2D,E). Figure 2 Figure 2.

The results of the study showed that the effect of the RHDS low-dose treatment group was closest to that of the Tamiflu treatment group (D,E).#p < 0.05 vs. control group, *p < 0.05 vs. model group, **p < 0.01 vs. model group, *p < 0.05 vs. Tamiflu group, **p < 0.01 vs. Tamiflu group. 3.3 Effects of RHDS granules on histopathological changes in mice lungs As shown by H&E staining, the lung tissues of mice in the control group had a clean and intact alveolar structure, with thin alveolar walls, no inflammatory secretions in the alveolar lumen, and no infiltration of inflammatory cells. Compared to the control group mice, the model group mice exhibited a greater quantity of inflammatory cells in the alveolar lumen, together with thickening of the alveolar septum and hemorrhage. All mice groups treated with RHDS showed a reduction in the inflammatory infiltration in lung tissues. However, localized infiltration of inflammatory cells was still noted, along with alveolar wall weakening, minimal alveolar wall congestion, and no appreciable thickening of the alveolar septa. Although the Tamiflu group showed fewer alveolar wall septa, some alveoli were still infiltrated with a small number of inflammatory cells. In the SHL group, focal areas of solid lesions were infiltrated with inflammatory cells, and solid areas with structurally intact alveoli were absent. This finding suggests that RHDS has a therapeutic effect on the lungs of mice with influenza (see Figure 3). Figure 3 Figure 3. Photographs of pathological changes in the lungs of mice infected with IAV for 5 days. The lungs of the control group were structurally intact with no inflammatory cell infiltration (A). The model group showed a large number of inflammatory cell infiltration and alveolar congestion in the lungs (B). The SHL group had focal areas of solid lesions infiltrated with inflammatory cells in the lungs (C). The Tamiflu group showed infiltration of a small number of inflammatory cells in the lungs (D). Inflammatory cell infiltration in the lung tissues of all RHDS groups was ameliorated to varying degrees (E–G). 3.4 Effect of RHDS granules on the serum levels of IL-6, TNF-α, and sIgA The ELISA results showed a significant increase in IL-6 and TNF-α levels and a significant decrease in sIgA levels in the model group as compared to those in the control group (p < 0.05). Furthermore, compared to the control group, the SHL, Tamiflu, and RHDS groups showed a significant reduction in IL-6 levels (p < 0.01). The slgA levels were significantly increased in the Tamiflu and RHDS groups (p < 0.01). Moreover, the TNF-α levels were highly significantly reduced in the SHL, Tamiflu, and RHDS-L groups (p < 0.01) and significantly decreased in the RHDS-M and RHDS-H groups (p < 0.05) (see Figure 4). Figure 4 Figure 4. Serum levels of IL-6, TNF-α, and sIgA as determined by ELISA (A–C). The ELISA results showed significantly higher levels of TNF-α and IL-6 and significantly lower levels of sIgA in the model group as compared to those in the control group. The Tamiflu and RHDS-L groups exhibited significantly lower levels of IL-6 and TNF-α and significantly higher levels of sIgA. #p < 0.05 vs. control group, *p < 0.05 vs. model group, **p < 0.01 vs. model group. 3.5 Variations in viral titers determined via RHDS in the lung tissue of IAV influenza virus-infected mice According to the qRT-PCR results, the control mice did not exhibit any viral detection. The model group’s mice’s lung tissues had a considerably greater viral titer of IAV (p < 0.01) than the animals in the control group (Figure 5A). The low-dosage group of RHDS had the greatest effect among all the dose groups, and the results are displayed in Figure 5. Compared with the model group, the viral titer reduced dramatically in both the positive drug group and the administered group (Figure 5B). Figure 5 Figure 5. Variation in the viral titer level in IAV mouse lung tissues. IAV viral titers in the lung tissue of the model group of mice were significantly elevated, while RHDS in all dose groups and the positive treatment group’s lung tissue had significantly lower levels of viral titers., **p < 0.01. 3.6 Effects of RHDS granules on the mRNA and protein expression levels of claudin-1, occludin, and ZO-1 Based on the qRT-PCR results, the model group showed significantly lower mRNA expression levels of claudin-1, occludin, and ZO-1 in their colon tissues as compared to the control group (p < 0.05). The mRNA expression levels of these proteins were significantly higher in the colon tissues of the SHL, Tamiflu, and RHDS-L group than in the colon tissues of the model group (p < 0.01). The RHDS-M group showed a significant increase in the mRNA expression levels of occludin and ZO-1 (p < 0.01). Western blotting assay revealed lower protein expression levels of claudin-1, occludin, and ZO-1 in the colon tissues of model group mice than in the colon tissues of control group mice (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the protein expression levels of claudin-1, occludin, and ZO-1 were significantly higher in the colon tissues of mice in the RHDS, SHL, and Tamiflu groups than in the colon tissues of model group mice (p < 0.01) (Figure 6). Figure 6 Figure 6. The mRNA expression levels of claudin-1, occludin, and ZO-1 were measured by qRT-PCR in the colon tissues (A–C). Protein expression levels of claudin-1, occludin, and ZO-1 were measured by western blotting assay in the colon (D–G). (D) Shows an image of the bands in the western blotting assay from top to bottom for claudin-1, occludin, ZO-1, and the internal reference. The mRNA and protein expression levels of claudin-1, occludin, and ZO-1 were significantly lower in the model group than in the control group, while they were significantly higher in the RHDS treatment groups. #p < 0.05 vs. control group, **p < 0.01 vs. model group. 3.7 Analysis of the intestinal microflora composition The structural composition of bacterial colonies isolated from mouse colonic fecal samples was analyzed at the phylum and genus levels by using QIIME software. Figure 7A shows the categorical bar clustering of species composition for each group at the phylum level. The mouse intestinal microbiota comprised 10 phyla, including Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Verrucomicrobiota, Actinobacteriota, Desulfobacterota, Campylobacterota, Proteobacteria, Patescibacteria, Cyanobacteria, and Desferriobacteria. Of these, the phyla Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes showed the highest abundance. The relative abundance of Firmicutes and Verrucomicrobiota tended to increase in the model group as compared to that in the control group. Furthermore, compared to the model group, the RHDS-L and RHDS-H groups showed significantly lower relative abundance of Firmicutes (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively), and the RHDS-H group exhibited significantly higher relative abundance of Verrucomicrobiota (p < 0.05). The relative abundance of Actinobacteriota was significantly higher in the model group than in the control group (p < 0.05). Compared to the model group, the relative abundance of the SHL group, Tamiflu group, RHDS-M group, and RHDS-H group were significantly decreased (p < 0.05). The relative abundance of the RHDS-L group was highly significantly decreased (p < 0.01) The results are shown in (Figures 7B–E). Figure 8A shows the top 20 genera for each group. The relative abundance of Muribaculaceae was significantly higher, while that of Faecalibaculum and Lactobacillus was significantly lower (p < 0.05) in the model group as compared to those in the control group. Furthermore, compared to the model group, the SHL, Tamiflu, and RHDS groups exhibited significantly lower relative abundance of Muribaculaceae (p < 0.01), the RHDS-H group showed significantly higher relative abundance of Akkermansia (p < 0.01), and all the RHDS groups displayed an increasing trend in the relative abundance of Faecalibaculum and Lactobacillus. The results are shown in Figures 8B–E. Figure 7 Figure 7. The composition of the intestinal microflora of mice was analyzed at the phylum level (A). (B–E) Represent Bacteroidetes, Verrucomicrobiota, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteriota, respectively. Compared to the model group, the RHDS-L and RHDS-H groups showed a significant decrease in the relative abundance of Firmicutes, and the RHDS-H group exhibited a significant increase in the relative abundance of Verrucomicrobiota. The relative abundance of Actinobacteriota was significantly decreased in the SHL, Tamiflu, RHDS-M, and RHDS-H groups. #p < 0.05 vs. control group, **p < 0.01 vs. model group. Figure 8 Figure 8. Analysis of the mice colonic microflora at the genus level (A). Compared to the control group, the model group showed a significant increase in the relative abundance of Muribaculaceae (B) and a significant decrease in the relative abundance of Faecalibaculum (D) and Akkermansia (E). The relative abundance of Lactobacillus (C) increased significantly and that of Muribaculaceae decreased significantly in the RHDS-H group as compared to those in the model group. #p < 0.05 vs. control group, **p < 0.01 vs. model group. 3.8 Analysis of the intestinal microflora composition and differential species analysis at the phylum and genus levels Alpha diversity and beta diversity indices are used to characterize the diversity of microbial species within and between habitats, respectively, to comprehensively evaluate their overall diversity. Alpha diversity is mainly reflected by the Chao1 index, Shannon index, Simpson index, and Observed_species index. As shown in Figure 9A, Chao1, Shannon, and Observed_species indices were significantly lower in the model group than in the control group (p < 0.01, p < 0.05, and p < 0.01, respectively), and the Simpson index was significantly higher (p < 0.01). Compared to the model group, the Tamiflu group showed significantly higher Chao1 index, Shannon index, and Observed_species index (p < 0.01, p < 0.05, and p < 0.01, respectively), and the RHDS-L group showed significantly higher Observed_species index (p < 0.05). These results showed that the abundance and diversity of the intestinal microflora were significantly reduced in IAV mice, and RHDS improved the imbalance of the intestinal microflora and increased its diversity in mice with influenza. Figure 9 Figure 9. Alpha diversity and beta diversity analyses of the mouse intestinal flora. Alpha diversity analyses included the results for Chao1 index, Shannon index, Simpson index, and Observed_species index (A). Compared to the control group, the model group showed significantly lower Chao1, Shannon, and Observed_species indices and significantly higher Simpson index. Furthermore, compared to the model group, the Tamiflu group showed significantly higher Chao1, Shannon, and Observed_species indices, and the RHDS-L group showed significantly higher Observed_species index. **P / ***p < 0.01 vs. control group, * P/ **p < 0.01 vs. model group. Beta diversity analyses (B,C) showed that the control group was clearly separated from the model group, the RHDS-M group tended to move closer to the control group along the PCo2 axis, and RHDS granule treatment reduced the variation in the composition of the intestinal microflora between IAV-infected mice and control mice. The samples were also analyzed by distance matrix with PCoA and NMDS analysis, and the results are shown in Figures 9B,C. According to the PCoA results, the control group was separated from the model group along the PCo2 axis, and the RHDS-M group tended to converge toward the control group along the PCo2 axis. The stress value was 0.125 in the NMDS analysis. This finding suggests a partial difference in the gut microbial composition between the control and model groups; furthermore, RHDS could reduce variability between the gut flora of IAV-infected mice and control mice. 4 Discussion Influenza is an acute respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses. It poses a substantial risk to human health as it can develop into a severe illness in susceptible individuals (Li and Cao, 2017). NA inhibitors and influenza vaccination are the two primary treatment approaches used to treat influenza patients. The development of vaccines for influenza is challenging and constrained because influenza viruses are constantly evolving through mutations; thus, novel anti-influenza medications need to be developed despite the potential side effects and drug resistance of NA inhibitors. In a healthy intestinal environment, the intestinal flora maintains a dynamic balance. However, the defenses of the intestinal flora are compromised under certain conditions that interfere with this balance; this increases intestinal permeability, leading to immunological diseases of the intestinal tissues (Wedgwood et al., 2020). Intricate bidirectional lymphatic and blood exchange between the lungs and the gut creates an intrapulmonary axis that interacts with factors responsible for illness development (Bingula et al., 2017). Increased amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the bloodstream are thought to modify the gut microbiota and jeopardize the intestinal epithelium’s integrity. As a result, the patient develops a “leaky gut, “which allows intestinal bacterial products and antigens to enter the bloodstream and exacerbate the illness (Sun et al., 2022). Bacterial metabolites and debris can enter the bloodstream and travel to distant organs when the intestinal barrier’s permeability is compromised, potentially affecting immune cells (Damiani et al., 2023). Thus, it is anticipated that a thorough investigation of the composition and activities of the gut microbiota will play a significant role in the search for novel therapeutic approaches for respiratory disorders (Hong, 2023). This indicates that targeting the lung-gut axis could open up a new approach to preventing and treating influenza. Therefore, the current study proposed that RHDS could potentially alleviate influenza through the use of the gut microbiota. In this study, the nasal drip model was used to infect mice with IAV. The results demonstrated that IAV-infected mice showed depression, emaciation, and weight loss. Several cytokines, including interferons, proinflammatory factors, and chemokines, are produced following the penetration of the mucosal barrier by the influenza virus, adsorption of the virus on the cells, and its invasion of the respiratory epithelial cells (Sato and Kiyono, 2012). In the present study, the results for the pulmonary splenic index, pathological changes in treated and untreated mice, and ELISA demonstrated that the IL-6 and TNF-α levels were significantly increased in IAV-infected mice and significantly decreased in RHDS granule-treated mice. These findings suggest that RHDS could inhibit the production of proinflammatory cytokines, thereby alleviating lung inflammation and reducing the immunological damage caused by influenza viruses. The TJ, which is formed by interactions between claudin, ZO-1, and members of the tight junction-associated marvel protein family, is a protein complex that plays a role in the first line of mucosal defense, i.e., the epithelial barrier (Kuo et al., 2022). The structure and function of the TJ largely depend on the claudin family of proteins, and higher expression of claudin-1 in this area suggests higher expression of inflammatory markers (Pope et al., 2014; Weber et al., 2008). Pathogens or antigenic components of pathogens cannot penetrate the gut’s lamina propria while the mucosal barrier is intact, and both humans and animals require a balanced intestinal microbiological environment to preserve homeostasis (Wang et al., 2022). The results of the present study indicate that RHDS treatment can mitigate the damage caused by the influenza virus to colonic tissues and exert a protective effect on the mucosal barrier. Specifically, the expression levels of claudin-1, occludin, and ZO-1 were significantly decreased in the colonic tissues of IAV-infected mice and increased to varying degrees in the RHDS dose groups. The present study also found that abnormalities in the composition of intestinal microbiota were mostly manifested in the model group in terms of increase in the abundance of harmful bacteria such as Muribaculaceae and a decrease in the abundance of beneficial bacteria such as Lactobacillus, Faecalibaculum, and Akkermansia. Probiotic use is a preventive or therapeutic strategy for autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases, as certain probiotic bacteria in the gut can alleviate these conditions (Green et al., 2020). Akkermansia muciniphila produces acetate and propionate; furthermore, a recent study revealed that Amuc_2109, an enzyme secreted by A. muciniphila, attenuates dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis, increases TJ protein expression, and decreases NLRP3 inflammatory vesicle expression in mice (Rodrigues et al., 2022; Qian et al., 2022). Faecalibaculum rodentium, a recently identified antitumor strain, can inhibit the growth of tumor cells and activate calmodulin phosphatase by reducing NFATc3 during the initial stages of tumor development. Thus, this strain could be a possible biomarker for the early detection of tumors (Zagato et al., 2020). Probiotic strains belonging to the Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium genera are the most frequently reported to offer protection against influenza infection (Groeger et al., 2020). These probiotic strains protect mice from influenza infection and have anti-inflammatory properties (Kato et al., 2023). Treatment with Lactobacillus can enhance animal health, alleviate clinical symptoms, lower lung viral load, and increase patient survival (Lehtoranta et al., 2014). A previous study reported that oral treatment with Lactobacillus YYC-3 suspension suppressed the NF-κB signaling pathway and downregulated the expression levels of inflammatory factors (Yue et al., 2020). 5 Conclusion The present study found that treatment with RHDS granules can minimize the immunological damage caused by influenza viruses to the body, prevent the emergence of IAV-induced lung inflammation, and suppress the production of proinflammatory cytokines. These effects could be accomplished by modifying the composition of the gut microbiota. Thus, this study indicates that RHDS granules have anti-influenza virus properties and that one of the mechanisms underlying these antiviral effects may be through the regulation of the intestinal microbiota composition by RHDS granules.

Awarded $3.3M NIH SBIR Grant for Developing MACH-1™ Enhanced Seasonal Influenza Vaccine October 10, 2024 | 3 min read Twitter LinkedIn Facebook Email Print SEATTLE, Oct. 10, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Orlance, Inc., an advancing biotech company based in Seattle, has been awarded National Institutions of Health (NIH) Fast Track Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant R44AI186932 to develop an Enhanced Seasonal Influenza Vaccine. This vaccine is intended to provide better protection against disease even in years when predicted vs. actual circulating strains are highly mismatched. The award includes $300,000 for Phase 1, with the total funding for the Phase 1 and 2 combined program amounting to $3.3 million. This Fast Track SBIR grant will enable Orlance to leverage its innovative MACH-1 powdered vaccine and immunotherapy platform to address both seasonally-changing and highly-conserved influenza immunogens in ways not possible with other platforms. The project aims to address the limitations of current flu vaccines by broadening the number of influenza strains that can be targeted within one vaccine, enabling vaccine production to occur closer to influenza season and achieve a better match between predicted and actual circulating strains, and by stimulating more diverse types of immune responses both in systemic and localized cells. Specifically, this program builds upon Orlance’s universal influenza vaccine, which targets conserved antigens that remain consistent across multiple virus lineages, and adds seasonally changing influenza antigens to maximize protection. The MACH-1 platform is a high-performance microparticle ‘gene gun’ technology that efficiently and uniquely delivers DNA or RNA vaccine-coated microparticles directly into cells in the epidermis, the uppermost layer of the skin. The epidermis is rich in immune stimulating cells. MACH-1 delivery harnesses this environment and the natural machinery of its immune cells to deliver DNA and RNA vaccines encoding proteins that trigger potent immunity including antibodies to block an infection and T cells that can eliminate infected cells. Unlike currently licensed mRNA vaccines, MACH-1-delivered vaccines are stable at room temperature and are painless and needle-free. Orlance MACH-1 vaccines also trigger protective levels of immunity with the smallest doses yet achieved within the field. “The unique properties of MACH-1 delivery into the highly immune competent epidermis that generates potent systemic and local respiratory mucosal antibody- and T cell-mediated immunity, coupled with the large payload capacity of DNA vaccines, may allow for Orlance’s universal influenza vaccine to excel where other universal vaccines have failed,” explains Orlance Head of Research and Development and Principal Investigator, Kenneth Bagley, PhD. “NIH’s continued funding support of the MACH-1 platform including this enhanced seasonal influenza vaccine reinforces the potential impact and significant step forward MACH-1 can bring to vaccine technology,” adds Kristyn Aalto, Orlance CEO. This award brings Orlance’s SBIR funding total to $16.8M to advance next generation DNA and RNA vaccines and therapeutics. The company’s ongoing research and development efforts continue to push the boundaries of what is possible in both vaccine and cancer immunotherapy science, with the ultimate goal of improving global health access and outcomes. Orlance was founded as a University of Washington spinout company in 2016 to develop the MACH-1 platform based on technology invented by Deborah Fuller, PhD, Professor of Microbiology at the University of Washington School of Medicine. Orlance plans to initiate Phase 1 clinical trials in 2026.

It is essential to routinely protect ourselves and those around us. On 9 October 2024, WHO/Europe is launching the “No one knows your risk like you do” campaign, encouraging people, especially the vulnerable, to assess their risks and take simple protective measures against respiratory viruses. While aimed at individuals, the campaign reiterates that health authorities play a key role in protecting their populations, including by continuing to provide timely health information and advice. Public health advice on COVID-19, influenza and other respiratory virusesThis autumn and winter, as respiratory viruses co-circulate across European and central Asian countries, it is important to be aware of your risk and take steps to protect yourself and the most vulnerable. Influenza and COVID-19 can affect everyone, but they can lead to severe illness in certain individuals, including older people, pregnant women, those with weakened immune systems and people with chronic conditions. If you belong to one of these groups, take extra care to stay protected. Here are 5 simple actions you can take to reduce your risk of getting ill and developing severe disease: get vaccinated stay at home if sick wear a mask in crowds clean your hands ventilate your space. Vaccination remains essential if you have never had COVID-19 or have not been vaccinated yet, especially if you are at higher risk. WHO/Europe advises getting the vaccine when it is offered to you. Wearing a mask in crowds is also still recommended, particularly if you belong to a group at higher risk of severe COVID-19, and to protect others around you.For more information on how to stay protected from respiratory viruses, see the leaflet with all the details. The concept behind WHO/Europe’s campaignThe new WHO/Europe campaign is being launched at a pivotal moment, marking the long transition from COVID-19 as an acute emergency to an ongoing risk. Reflecting societal lessons, it broadens the focus to preventing respiratory diseases, making protection a normalized part of daily life. “This year’s campaign, ‘No one knows your risk like you do’, encourages individuals to assess their personal risks, fostering trust in their ability to make responsible choices for themselves and their community,” says Cristiana Salvi, Regional Adviser for Risk Communication, Community Engagement and Infodemic Management (RCCE-IM) at WHO/Europe. The campaign's call to action – Take care #LikeOnlyYouCan – encourages proactive health measures, promoting community solidarity and ownership. Targeted submessages for vulnerable groups remind them of their heightened risk and actions to protect themselves, while the hashtag #LikeOnlyYouCan emphasizes personal decision-making, linking empowerment with responsibility. As part of the shared responsibility, the role of government authorities remains crucial. They must enable and empower individuals to make informed decisions that protect their health and that of the most vulnerable members of society.

Sixteen human bird flu cases have been reported in the United States this year, including the two workers who tested positive in California. Fifteen of those cases were in farm workers at infected poultry or dairy farms. Public health officials say the risk to the general public frombird flu is low. The sick workers had only conjunctivitis, or pink eye, and did not report respiratory symptoms, Nirav Shah, principal deputy director at CDC, said on a Friday press call. More than 250 dairy herds in 14 states have tested positive for bird flu this year, including 56 in California, according to the US Department of Agriculture. The CDC is continuing to investigate whether any healthcare workers may have been infected with bird flu after one person tested positive in Missouri, Shah said. The agency’s testing of seven blood samples from healthcare workers who were exposed to the sick person, which would indicate whether they had previously contracted the virus, could take another two weeks, he said. The bird flu strain detected on the two California farms is the same as has been detected on dairy farms in other states and the affected farms are quarantined, Eric Deeble, deputy under secretary for marketing and regulatory programs at USDA, said on the call. Colorado, which in the spring was a hot spot for bird flu spread on dairy farms, now has just one positive herd, indicating success of the state’s mandatory bulk milk testing, Deeble said. Pasteurized dairy products remain safe to consume, Steve Grube, chief medical officer at the Food and Drug Administration’s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, said on the call. The FDA said on Thursday that it will soon launch a study of raw cow’s milk at some dairy plants to better understand the prevalence of thebird flu virus in the milk supply.

(John Bazemore, AP Photo, File) (John Bazemore, AP Photo, File) Share BY MARK JONES KSLTV.com TAYLORSVILLE — The Utah Department of Agriculture and Food confirmed Saturday a diagnosis of highly pathogenic avian influenza, also known as bird flu, in a commercial poultry flock in northern Utah. “Our State Veterinarian’s office was notified of symptomatic birds in Cache County and our team was immediately dispatched to assess the situation,” said Utah State Veterinarian Dr. Daniel Christensen in a news release. “Proper steps are being taken to prevent further spread of the disease.” According to the release, the location of the birds has been quarantined. The release further states that birds infected will be “depopulated” to help reduce the further spread of the disease. Officials from the UDAF and U.S. Department of Agriculture will be monitoring the area around the infected flock, and will be conducting additional testing. The UDAF is urging poultry owners to closely watch their flocks for symptoms of the disease. Symptoms of the disease include the following: Nasal discharge Decreased appetite or water consumption Lack of coordination If you have birds that are showing any of those symptoms, you are asked to contact the state veterinarian at statevet@utah.gov. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the disease does not pose an immediate health threat for humans. However, safety precautions are still highly recommended. “As a reminder, the proper handling and cooking of all poultry and eggs to an internal temperature of 165 (degrees) is recommended as a general food safety precaution,” the release stated.

View all partners Email X (Twitter) Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger A scratchy, sore throat, a relentless fever, a pounding head and a nasty cough – these symptoms all scream upper respiratory illness. But which one? Many of the viruses that cause upper respiratory infections such as influenza A or B and the virus that causes COVID-19 all employ similar tactics. They target the same areas in your body – primarily the upper and lower airways – and this shared battleground triggers a similar response from your immune system. Overlapping symptoms – fever, cough, fatigue, aches and pains – make it difficult to determine what may be the underlying cause. Now, at-home rapid tests can simultaneously determine whether someone has COVID-19 or the flu. Thanks in part to the National Institutes of Health’s Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics, or RADx, program, the Food and Drug Administration has provided emergency use authorization for seven at-home rapid tests that can distinguish between COVID-19, influenza A and influenza B. Our team in Atlanta – composed of biomedical engineers, clinicians and researchers at Emory University, Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta and Georgia Institute of Technology – is part of the RADx Test Verification Core. We closely collaborate with other institutions and agencies to determine whether and how well COVID-19 and influenza diagnostics work, effectively testing the tests. Our center has worked with almost every COVID and flu diagnostic on the market, and our data helped inform the instructions you might see in many of the home test kits on the market. While no test is perfect, to now be able to test for certain viruses at home when symptoms begin can help patients and their doctors come up with appropriate care plans sooner. A new era of at-home tests Traditionally, identifying the virus causing upper respiratory illness symptoms required going to a clinic or hospital for a trained medical professional to collect a nasopharyngeal sample. This involves inserting a long, fiber-tipped swab that looks like a skinny Q-tip into one of your nostrils and all the way to the back of your nose and throat to collect virus-containing secretions. The sample is then typically sent to a lab for analysis, which could take hours to days for results. The COVID-19 pandemic made over-the-counter tests for respiratory illnesses commonplace. DuKai/Moment via Getty Images Thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic, the possibility of using over-the-counter tests to diagnose respiratory illnesses at home became a reality. These tests used a much gentler and less invasive nasal swab and could also be done by anyone, anytime and in their own home. However, these tests were designed to diagnose only COVID-19 and could not distinguish between other types of illnesses. Since then, researchers have developed over-the-counter multiplex tests that can screen for more than one respiratory infection at once. In 2023, Pfizer’s Lucira test became the first at-home diagnostic test for both COVID-19 and influenza to gain emergency use authorization. What are multiplex rapid tests? There are two primary forms of at-home COVID-19 and COVID-19/flu combination tests: molecular tests such as PCR that detect genetic material from the virus, and antigen tests – commonly referred to as rapid tests – that detect proteins called antigens from the virus. The majority of over-the-counter COVID-19 and COVID-19/flu tests on the market are antigen tests. They detect the presence of antigens in your nasal secretions that act as a biological signature for a specific virus. If viral antigens are present, that means you’re likely infected. Respiratory illnesses such as flu, COVID-19 and RSV can be hard to tell apart. To detect these antigens, rapid tests have paper-like strips coated with specially engineered antibodies that function like a molecular Velcro, sticking only to a specific antigen. Scientists design and manufacture specialized strips to recognize specific viral antigens, like those belonging to influenza A, influenza B or the virus that causes COVID-19. The antibodies for these viral targets are placed on the strip, and when someone’s nasal sample has viral proteins that are applied to the test strip, a line will appear for that virus in particular. Advancing rapid antigen tests Like all technologies, rapid antigen tests have limitations. Compared with lab-based PCR tests that can detect the presence of small amounts of pathogen by amplifying them, antigen tests are typically less sensitive than PCR and could miss an infection in some cases. All at-home COVID-19 and COVID-19/flu antigen tests are authorized for repeat use. This means if someone is experiencing symptoms – or has been exposed to someone with COVID-19 but is not experiencing symptoms – and has a negative result for their first test, they should retest 48 hours later. Another limitation to rapid antigen tests is that currently they are designed to test only for COVID-19, influenza A and influenza B. Currently available over-the-counter tests aren’t able to detect illnesses from pathogens that look like these viruses and cause similar symptoms, such as adenovirus or strep. Because multiplex texts can detect several different viruses, they can also produce findings that are more complex to interpret than tests for single viruses. This may increase the risk of a patient incorrectly interpreting their results, misreading one infection for another. Researchers are actively developing even more sophisticated tests that are more sensitive and can simultaneously screen for a wider range of viruses or even bacterial infections. Scientists are also examining the potential of using saliva samples in tests for bacterial or viral infections. Additionally, scientists are exploring integrating multiplex tests with smartphones for rapid at-home diagnosis and reporting to health care providers. This may increase the accessibility of these tests for people with vision impairment, low dexterity or other challenges with conducting and interpreting at-home tests. Faster and more accurate diagnoses lead to more targeted and effective treatment plans, potentially reducing unnecessary antibiotic use and improving patient outcomes. The ability to rapidly identify and track outbreaks can also empower public health officials to better mitigate the spread of infectious diseases.

The Allegheny County Health Department launched a new online respiratory virus dashboard Monday. The tool provides data on local cases of COVID-19, respiratory syncytial virus or RSV and influenza.The interactive platform tracks reported infections, emergency room visits, hospitalizations and deaths associated with the three viruses. The tool launches as the respiratory virus season gets underway: cases of the flu, COVID-19 and RSV typically increase during the fall and winter.Officials said the dashboard will help residents stay informed about how viruses are spreading locally.“The dashboard is a great way to check what is happening right now in the county with regard to COVID, flu, and RSV,” said Dr. Kristen Mertz, a medical epidemiologist with the health department. The tool and other guidance and information can be accessed through the county’s website. WESA Inbox Edition Newsletter Do you like science, health and tech stories?

Though it’s hard to capture a full picture of the rate of these viruses, as many cases go unreported, officials have said the data can help residents follow trends and take precautions when infections are on the rise.The data stretches back to 2019 and can be broken down into age group, race, ethnicity and sex.The health department also issued a statement Monday advising residents to get updated respiratory virus vaccines. The county’s immunization clinic recently received a supply of the updated COVID-19 vaccine and is offering free shots for residents without insurance.Officials said residents over the age of six months should get an updated vaccine “regardless of whether they have previously been vaccinated against COVID-19.”That’s because previous vaccines have proven to be less effective against the current most common strain of the virus."The COVID-19 virus continues to evolve, and vaccine protection can diminish over time," said Dr. Barbara Nightingale, the health department’s deputy director for clinical services. "Getting an updated COVID-19 vaccine can restore immunity and provide enhanced protection against the variants that are currently responsible for most infections and hospitalizations.”In 2023, Allegheny County reported 355 COVID-19-related deaths and more than 5,000 hospitalizations.Officials are also urging residents to get vaccinated against the flu and for more vulnerable residents to get the RSV vaccine. The RSV antibody injection was in short supply last year. But the county said those shots are now available for older adults, infants and pregnant people.“The CDC recommends the RSV vaccine for everyone 75 years and older and for certain adults aged 60 to 74 who are at risk for severe RSV,” said Dr. Nightingale. “Pregnant people may receive the vaccine late in their pregnancy, or infants can receive a long-acting antibody injection to protect them against RSV.” Tags Health, Science & Tech Top Story Facebook LinkedIn Email Kiley Koscinski Kiley Koscinski covers health and science.

Question Has influenza season started yet in Eastern Idaho? Answer While influenza season in eastern Idaho hasn’t become widespread yet in our area, it is imminent. Influenza, commonly known as the flu, is a highly contagious respiratory illness that can affect people of all ages, but children, particularly those under 5 years old, are more vulnerable because their immune systems are still developing. Symptoms of the flu in children often include fever, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, body aches, and fatigue. It’s important to recognize these symptoms early on and seek medical attention promptly to prevent complications and ensure a speedy recovery for your child. It is also important to know that vomiting/diarrhea illnesses are commonly misnamed as “the flu.” Children, especially those under 5, are at higher risk of severe flu-related complications. These can include: pneumonia, dehydration, worsening of chronic medical conditions such as asthma and sinus or ear infections. In some cases, flu complications in children can lead to hospitalization or, rarely, death. Children under 2 years old are particularly vulnerable to getting more severe illness. It was reported that there were 200 pediatric deaths linked to influenza during the 2023-2024 flu season. The most effective way to protect children from the flu is through annual vaccination. The CDC recommends that children 6 months and older receive a flu vaccine every year. Vaccination can reduce the risk of flu illness, hospitalization, and complications. Other preventive measures include: hand washing, avoiding contact with sick individuals, and proper cover technique for coughing and sneezing. If a child contracts the flu, antiviral medications (like oseltamivir or Tamiflu) can be prescribed, especially if given early in the illness. These medications may help reduce the severity and duration of symptoms. Parents should monitor symptoms, and seek medical attention if their child experiences trouble breathing, high fever, lethargy, or other severe symptoms.

Dr. Monalisa Tailor, a primary care physician with Norton Community Medical Associates in Louisville, explained during a recent press conference that the U.S. looks to the Southern Hemisphere countries as an indicator of how this year’s flu season and vaccine might fare, since its winter happens during the Northern Hemisphere’s summer. According to a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the flu shot appeared to be 34.5 percent effective at preventing hospitalizations this year in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay. That’s down from about 52% effective during the 2023 flu season in the same countries. (Photo from KHN) Tailor said news like that is sure to make people wonder why they should even get a flu vaccine this year, but it’s important to remember that a flu vaccine that is 35% effective means that it reduces the risk of severe illness and hospitalization by 35% — and that makes it worth getting. “When it comes to my patients… they might be older with multiple other medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, autoimmune conditions or even cancer, and if I could keep them out of the hospital because of flu, that would be a win, especially for my older folks,” she said. Further, she said, that while the flu vaccine’s effectiveness is less than last year, it’s still on par with the previous six years. To find a place to get your flu shot, the CDC offers an interactive “flu vaccine finder” that allows you to type in your ZIP code to find nearby locations. Local health departments also offer the vaccine. This year’s flu season will be the first time that people in the U.S. will be able to administer their own flu vaccines at home, without the aid of a health care provider. Last month, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved a nasal spray called FluMist as the first self-administered flu vaccine for individuals aged 2 through 49 years of age. Vaccine hesitancy Asked about vaccine hesitancy, Tailor said she tells her patients it’s important to get vaccinated, whether for the flu or other diseases, because it offers protection against the disease and gives our bodies a blueprint for how to fight them. “So that way, your symptoms are not as severe as what they would have been otherwise,” she said. Flu can be life-threatening, she said, especially for high-risk groups such as the elderly, people with certain chronic medical conditions, and small children. According to the CDC, an estimated 75 million people in the U.S. got the flu during last year’s flu season, resulting in 900,000 hospitalizations and between 17,000 and 100,000 deaths, including 200 children. “So regardless of how old you are, it is important to get a vaccine to help make your body smarter, help your body fight off these illnesses because they can be life-threatening,” she said. When should you get the flu vaccine? Tailor recommended getting a flu shot sometime in the next five weeks to allow for maximum protection during the holidays and the cold, winter months when people tend to congregate indoors. Health officials encourage everyone six months and older to get a flu shot, because it’s the best defense in fighting the flu. Asked about taking the flu vaccine and the Covid-19 vaccine at the same time, Tailor said that while it is safe to take them together, it’s important to think about how you’ve reacted to the vaccines in the past when you make this decision. For example, she said, if one or both of the shots have historically made you feel bad for a few days after getting them, you might consider spacing them out.

Footage obtained by Newsweek from a California veterinarian shows dead dairy cows infected with avian influenza piled by the roadside without any biosecurity measures or warning signs.The vet fears the dead animals could further spread the H5 bird flu outbreak which continues to ravage California cattle farms, with 100 herds affected, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).The videos, captured on Oct. 8 by veterinarian Crystal Heath, shows the pile of deceased dairy cows outside Mendonsa Farms, just south of Tulare, California.These cows, confirmed to have been infected with avian influenza (H5N1), were left exposed without any warning signs or biosecurity precautions. The footage was deemed too graphic for publication."What was so shocking was that there was so little signage around anywhere telling the public about avian influenza and warning them of the biosecurity risks," Heath told Newsweek."I'm worried that wildlife could come into contact with them. We know that cats are susceptible to avian influenza; the first sign that a farm has an infection is often when cats end up dying after they've drunk raw milk."Anja Raudabaugh, CEO of Western United Dairies—the trade organization representing Mendonsa Farms—confirmed that the dead cattle had succumbed to bird flu."These cattle have passed away from avian influenza under quarantine procedures. They must be removed from the healthy herd and separated," Raudabaugh told Newsweek, acknowledging that the handling of the carcasses in this case was not standard practice. Dairy cattle feed at a farm on March 31, 2017. Footage obtained by Newsweek shows infected cow carcasses piled up at the side of the road with no biosecurity measures in place. Dairy cattle feed at a farm on March 31, 2017. Footage obtained by Newsweek shows infected cow carcasses piled up at the side of the road with no biosecurity measures in place. Rodrigo Abd/AP Raudabaugh added, "There are so many cattle passing away from avian influenza that the rendering trucks are backed up, which is why [the cattle] had been left there for a period of time."She called for more resources to help deal with the outbreak. "We are desperately overwhelmed at this point."Heath also captured footage of more cow carcasses left exposed outside another nearby farm."These bodies just being left out there is concerning," Heath said. "It wasn't hard to stumble across these cows, and given now there's now 100 farms affected and we're seeing a higher rate of mortality in these cows in California[...]you can only imagine how many bodies there could be." In addition to her veterinary work, Heath serves as the executive director of Our Honor, a nonprofit advocating for better biosecurity measures, including mandatory milk testing, public awareness campaigns, and flu vaccinations for workers to prevent coinfections with H5N1 and seasonal flu.On Oct. 9, the CDC confirmed a third human case of H5 bird flu in California, all linked to exposure to infected dairy cows. The three cases occurred in workers from different farms with no known contact, suggesting cow-to-human transmission, the CDC said."The current bird flu situation in the U.S. is quite disturbing and odd," Jeremy Rossman, senior lecturer in virology at the University of Kent, U.K., previously told Newsweek following the announcement from the CDC that two human cases had been confirmed in California."I do not think they are doing a good job at containing the outbreak, and put simply, they are not containing the outbreak."The concern, of course is that ongoing transmission within cattle will allow the virus to mutate to a form that spreads well in the air between mammals. If that happens and the virus maintains a high case-fatality rate, as bird flu is known for, the result could be catastrophic."So far, no human-to-human transmission of bird flu has been detected, and infections have typically been mild."However, we just don't know for certain right now, and the risks are considerable with insufficient action being taken to prevent this," Rossman said.To date, livestock outbreaks have affected 14 states, with 300 herds testing positive. California has been one of the hardest-hit, with 100 herds infected.Is there a health problem that's worrying you? Let us know via health@newsweek.com.

But experts warn that without more surveillance, cases will slip through the cracks – if they haven’t already – which raises the risk of the virus spurring a pandemic in people. Since 2003, roughly 900 people worldwide are reported to have had H5N1, around half of whom died of the infection.

Like the two cases in that state confirmed last week, the person reported occupational exposure to infected dairy cows. To date, all three California cases occurred in dairy workers from three different affected farms with no known contact with each other, suggesting animal-to-human spread. Also consistent with the two previous California cases, the person experienced mild symptoms, including eye redness or discharge (conjunctivitis). None of the three cases has been hospitalized. The identification of H5 in people with exposure to infected animals is not unexpected and does not change CDC's risk assessment for the general public, which continues to be low. Including this most recent case, 18 human cases of H5 bird flu have now been reported in the United States since 2022; 17 cases during 2024. CDC is awaiting 2 additional presumptive positive specimens from California for confirmatory testing. CDC Lab Update on First Two California Cases Sequences from the first two cases in California confirmed these are clade 2.3.4.4b A(H5N1) viruses closely related to viruses detected in dairy cattle. The whole genome was sequenced from one of the two cases (A/California/135/2024) and was confirmed to be a B3.13 genotype virus. There were no genetic changes observed that are known to be associated with an increased ability to infect or spread between people or known to reduce susceptibility to antiviral medications. These sequences have been publicly posted in GISAID and have been submitted to GenBank. Sequencing from the third confirmed case is underway. CDC continues to underscore the importance of recommended precautions for people with exposure to infected or potentially infected animals. People with close or prolonged, unprotected exposures to infected birds or other animals (including livestock), or to environments contaminated by infected birds or other animals, are at greater risk of infection. ### U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Whether diseases start at home or abroad, are curable or preventable, chronic or acute, or from human activity or deliberate attack, CDCâs world-leading experts protect lives and livelihoods, national security and the U.S. economy by providing timely, commonsense information, and rapidly identifying and responding to diseases, including outbreaks and illnesses.

Patel, MDOctober 7, 2024Every fall and winter, that familiar feeling seems to creep up at least once: a slight tickle in your throat, congestion in your nose, or an annoying cough that just won’t quit. Usually, that means you’re sick with something—probably a cold or the flu.It’s not surprising if you’re not sure what you’ve caught, considering how often we often lump cold and flu into the same general category. Yes, they’re both caused by viruses and tend to trigger similar symptoms, but they’re also very different illnesses.Cold vs. flu and stomach flu | Cold and flu symptoms | How long does a cold or the flu last? | Cold and flu medicine and treatments | When to see a doctor | Cold and flu preventionGiacomo GambineriCold vs. flu and the stomach fluYou’ve probably endured many colds in your lifetime, as this viral infection affects millions of people every year in the US, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).Common colds are caused by “one of many respiratory viruses, such as parainfluenza, rhinovirus, and coronaviruses,” Dawn Nolt, MD, MPH, a professor specializing in pediatric infectious diseases at Oregon Health & Science University, tells SELF. Rhinoviruses are by far the most common to cause colds, but human coronaviruses are also a likely culprit (though that does not include the coronaviruses that cause COVID-19, SARS, or MERS).1The flu, which is short for influenza, is also a common infectious disease; it affects an average of 8% of people in the US every year, per the CDC. There are only three viruses that can cause the flu in people: influenza A, B, or C. While influenza C usually leads to mild cases of the flu, both influenza A and B are the viruses responsible for causing the “flu season” we prepare for every fall and winter, per the CDC.Once a person has a cold or the flu, they are contagious and can spread it to other people, mainly via respiratory droplets that spread through coughing, sneezing, or talking. It’s also possible for a person to catch a cold or flu by touching a contaminated surface, like a germy doorknob, and then touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.Colds tend to be mild, and you can usually recover at home without needing any treatment. The flu, on the other hand, can lead to potentially serious complications in high-risk people, including infants, pregnant people, immunocompromised people, and older adults.The term “stomach flu” is a bit confusing, however, because it isn’t actually caused by influenza, a virus that only affects your respiratory system, according to the Mayo Clinic. “Stomach flu is a common name for gastroenteritis, which is an infection of the stomach and intestines,” Omer Eugene Beaird, MD, an assistant clinical professor of infectious diseases at the UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine, tells SELF. Stomach flu symptoms tend to affect the digestive tract more prominently, often setting off cramping, diarrhea, vomiting, and nausea, in addition to muscle aches and a low-grade fever. “Most cases of gastroenteritis are caused by norovirus and enteroviruses,” Dr. Beaird says.Back to topCold and FluWhat Your Snot Color Can Tell You About Your Health, According to DoctorsIt could be a cold, allergies, or something else.By Amy Marturana Winderl, C.P.T. and ​Jessica MigalaMedically reviewed by Mathew Devine, DOCold and FluNow’s a Great Time to Get Your Annual Flu ShotExperts say the 2022-2023 season may be especially bad.By Maggie O'NeillCold and Flu3 Ways to Stop a Runny Nose ASAPIt’ll depend on whether you have allergies, a cold, or something else.By Katie BowlesMedically reviewed by Mathew Devine, DOCold and FluThe US Is Expecting a Rough Flu Season—Here's How Long Symptoms Usually LastPlus, why some people get sicker than others.By Maggie O'NeillCold and Flu10 Flu Vaccine Side Effects That Are Totally NormalIt’s not too late to get vaccinated!By Beth KrietschMedically reviewed by Scott Braunstein, MDChevronChevronCommon cold and flu symptomsIt can sometimes be hard to tell whether you’ve caught a cold or come down with the flu, but there are usually a few signs you have one or the other, according to the CDC.When you have a cold, you might notice that symptoms are more gradual; they may develop over the course of a day or a few days. You’re likely to have more uncomfortable upper respiratory symptoms than anything else, which can include a sore throat, cough, lots of snot and sneezing, and blocked sinuses. While it’s possible for a cold to cause a fever and body aches, these signs are not as common.When you have the flu, the symptoms usually hit you pretty quickly: We’re talking body aches at noon with a full-blown fever by that evening. Fever and chills, muscle pain, and dreadful fatigue are all extremely common with the flu. You probably won’t notice as many chest and sinus-related symptoms as with a cold, but it is still possible to develop a cough or headache.3Back to topHow long does a cold or flu last for most people?When you’re stuck in bed sneezing into your tissues or fighting off a fever, it can feel like it’s taking forever to recover. But for most people, “forever” is really about a week—the average amount of time it takes for a generally healthy person to get over a nasty cold or mild flu.More specifically, the common cold usually lasts anywhere between 7 and 10 days, per the CDC, as long as you haven’t developed another condition, like bronchitis (inflammation in your lungs). The flu usually lasts about three to seven days, unless you fall into a high-risk group; in this case, it may take up to two weeks, sometimes longer, to fully recover, according to the CDC.Back to topCold and flu medicine and treatmentsIt can feel downright miserable to be stuck in bed, sipping on soup and water, but this is exactly what you should be doing to feel better faster, per the CDC. Antibiotics don't work against viruses, so they won’t treat a common cold or the flu. Instead, the best thing you can do is give your body the time it needs to heal. “Supportive care is the foundation of treating respiratory illnesses,” Dr. Nolt stresses. “This includes taking medication to reduce fever, staying well hydrated, and rest.”OTC medications that can help alleviate icky cold symptoms include pain relievers for things like muscle aches, throat lozenges for sore throat, saline nasal drops for congestion, and general cold medications that treat various symptoms at once, among others.2As for treating the flu, an antiviral may help if your doctor recommends it. “These are prescription medications, such as oseltamivir and baloxavir, that can shorten the time of illness,” Dr. Beaird says. For anyone who faces a higher risk of potential complications, like pneumonia, antivirals4 are always recommended, he says. Back to topWhen should you see a doctor?Usually, a cold or flu will run its course and can be managed with home care, but it’s important to keep an eye out for symptoms of a serious infection or potential complications. “Regardless of which virus is causing the illness, signs that people should seek medical attention include difficulty breathing, pain in the chest, severe muscle pain, not urinating for many hours, or if pre-existing medical conditions become worse,” Dr. Nolt says.Otherwise, take the time to rest, hydrate, binge-watch that show you’ve been meaning to get to, or whatever else it takes to get you back to feeling a bit more like yourself.Back to topCold and flu preventionYou can’t always prevent a cold or the flu, but there are some things you can do to reduce your chances of getting sick. There is no vaccine for the common cold, so you’ll want to practice good habits to prevent the spread of this infectious disease, per the CDC:Get your yearly flu vaccine.Wash your hands thoroughly and frequently. Hand sanitizer helps in a pinch.Cover your nose and mouth when you sneeze or cough, ideally with a tissue or the crook of your elbow.Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.Stay home when you’re sick, if you can.Wear a face mask in public if you’re unsure what you’re sick with.Avoid close contact with people who are sick or appear to be unwell.Frequently clean high-touch surfaces and objects in your home.All of those tips are useful for preventing the flu too, but you do have one other powerful tool: the annual flu vaccine. “Vaccines are a way to give our immune system memory of viruses before we’ve been infected by them,” Dr. Beaird explains. This means that when you do encounter that same virus in the future, your body is better prepared to fight it off.5You should aim to get your flu vaccine by the end of October since it takes a couple of weeks for your body to build up the necessary antibodies. Getting your flu shot, in addition to the steps above, can help you stay as healthy as possible during the colder months.Back to topSources:StatPearls, Upper Respiratory InfectionStatPearls, InfluenzaAmerican Family Physician, Treatment of the Common ColdJAMA Network Open, Comparison of Antiviral Agents for Seasonal Influenza Outcomes in Healthy Adults and ChildrenThe Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Vaccines for Preventing Influenza in the ElderlyRSVRespiratory Syncytial Virus Is the Flu-Like Illness You Haven’t Heard AboutHere’s what to look out for.By Korin Miller and Ashley AbramsonHealth3 Ways to Unclog a Miserably Stuffy NoseIf allergies, a cold, or something else has you blocked, don’t just try to blow through it.By Alexis BergerMedically reviewed by Aaron N.

High pathogenicity avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs) have caused major epizootics in the last years with devastating consequences for poultry and wildlife worldwide. Domestic and wild ducks can be highly susceptible to HPAIVs, and infection leads to efficient viral replication and massive shedding (high titers for an extended time), contributing to widespread viral dissemination. Ducks are known to shed high amounts of virus in the earliest phase of infection, but the dynamics and impact of environmental contamination in the epidemiology of HPAIV outbreaks is poorly understood. In a study, we monitored mule ducks experimentally infected with two H5N8 clade 2.3.4.4b HPAIVs sampled in France in the 2016-2017 and 2020-2021 epizootics. We investigated viral shedding dynamics in oropharynx, cloaca, conjunctiva, and feathers; bird-to-bird viral transmission; and the role of the environment in viral spread and as sampling strategy for early detection and surveillance. Our findings confirmed that viral shedding started before the onset of clinical signs; as early as one day post-inoculation (dpi) or post-contact exposure, then peaked at 4 dpi, and lasted for 14 dpi. Detection of viral RNA in aerosols, dust, and water samples mirrored viral shedding dynamics, and viral isolation from these environmental samples was successful all throughout the experiment. Our results confirmed that mule ducks can shed high HPAIV titers through various excretion routes while being asymptomatic, and that environmental sampling could be a non-invasive tool for early viral RNA detection in HPAIV infected farms. Dust sampling for HPAI There are many possible lines of research to improve the efficiency of dust sampling: one of the main drawbacks is that dust may contain organic substances that can inhibit RT-qPCR reactions. To limit this inhibition, we tested the use of bovine serum albumin (BSA), a molecule known to facilitate DNA polymerization in the presence of numerous inhibitors, including those from feces, litter or food. Dust samples were collected on 107 farms localized in areas affected by epizootics of clade 2.3.4.4b HPAIV H5N8. Our results indicate that the addition of BSA to the RT-qPCR reaction mix improved significantly the sensitivity of the method. The use of BSA could be routinely implemented in HPAIV dust monitoring RT-qPCR protocols. These results, combined with previous field observations, suggest that dust sampling may represent a relevant alternative to tracheal or cloacal swabbing, as it is cheap, non-invasive for animals, simpler and quicker to carry out.

The influenza vaccination - required for all active duty military personnel, selected Reservists and healthcare workers - shot exercise for tenant commands will be held October 21-22, 2024, at NHB’s Health and Education Center (BHEC), 2850 Thresher Ave, Naval Base Kitsap Bangor, from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. The annual influenza vaccination for all eligible family members of active duty and retirees will take place October 23-27, 2024, also at NHB’s BHEC, Wednesday-Friday, from 1 p.m. to 6 p.m., and Saturday and Sunday, from noon until 5 p.m. There has already been an increase of positive influenza cases of late. Dr. Dan Frederick, NHB Population Health Officer, emphasizes that immunization remains the primary method of reducing seasonal influenza illness and any potential associated complications. Being vaccinated against the viral threat not only helps protect vaccinated individuals but can assist in protecting family and co-workers by helping reduce the spread of the disease. “Getting the flu shot helps protect someone once the flu season starts in their community. The vaccination can reduce flu illnesses, doctors' visits, and missed work and school due to the illness,” Frederick said. Frederick also emphasizes that just as it is important for military personnel who live and work in close quarters to receive the vaccine, it is also highly recommended for school-aged children. “Influenza is not the common cold. It can be a life-threatening disease that especially can put specific groups in jeopardy,” explained Frederick. “While certainly people with respiratory conditions, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), are at increased risk, those over 65, young children, and pregnant women would be at the top of my list.” For those who opt to receive their influenza vaccination elsewhere, there are a number of outlets in the surrounding community that accept TRICARE. NHB requests for those who do get their flu shot out in town – especially active duty, selected reserve, and healthcare workers - to provide documentation of receipt to their medical staff, provider, or directly to NHB Immunizations Clinic to update their medical record. As a contagious respiratory illness, the flu has varying degrees of symptoms, ranging from no symptoms (asymptomatic) to severe symptoms which can develop from one to four days after infection and include such signs as: • Fever or feeling feverish/chills. • Cough • Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing • Fatigue (tiredness) • Sore throat • Runny or stuffy nose • Muscle pain or body aches • Headache • Some people may have vomiting and diarrhea, though more common in children. There are [also] a number of daily measures which anyone can implement to help protect themselves during cold and flu season. According to the CDC, along with getting vaccinated, there are a few healthy habits to protect against flu,” said Lt. Anurag Sharma, NHB Preventive Medicine department head and environmental health officer. “Personal hygiene by routinely washing hands thoroughly and appropriately. Avoid close contact. Stay home when sick. Cover your mouth and nose if ill and when coughing or sneezing and avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth.” NEWS INFO Date Taken: 10.10.2024 Date Posted: 10.10.2024 12:44 Story ID: 482921 Location: BREMERTON , WASHINGTON, US Web Views: 154 Downloads: 0 PUBLIC DOMAIN This work, Naval Hospital Bremerton sticklers for annual Flu Vaccine, by Douglas Stutz, identified by DVIDS, must comply with the restrictions shown on https://www.dvidshub.net/about/copyright.

Top 14 Natural Flu Remedies, Including Best Foods By Dr. Josh Axe, DC, DNM, CN October 10, 2024 Dr. Axe on Facebook 5319 Dr. Axe on Twitter 58 Dr. Axe on Instagram Dr. Axe on Google Plus Dr. Axe on Youtube Dr. Axe on Pintrest 499 Share on Email Print Article What is the flu?Flu vs. the common coldNatural flu remediesConventional treatmentRisks and side effects Each season, the flu affects about 8 percent of the United States population, on average. Those numbers may be even higher for asymptomatic people, leading many to search for natural flu remedies (which often double as natural cold remedies). Children are most likely to become sick from the flu, or influenza, but people with a depressed immune system or nutrient deficiencies may also be more prone to catching the virus. Stress, lack of sleep and exposure to toxins can worsen flu symptoms. Fortunately, there are natural flu remedies that can help boost your immune system to fight off the flu or relieve symptoms. What is the flu? The flu is a contagious respiratory illness caused by the influenza virus. These viruses spread through the air from person to person. Signs and symptoms of flu may include:Ad Fever Cough Runny nose Muscle or body aches Sore throat Headaches Fatigue Vomiting Diarrhea The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that although anyone can get the flu, young children are affected by the virus most often. Pregnant women and adults 65 years old and older are at greater risk of developing serious flu-related complications because of their suppressed immune systems. Flu vs. the common cold The flu and the common cold are both respiratory illnesses with similar symptoms, but they are caused by different viruses. Sometimes, it can be difficult to tell the difference between the flu and a cold, but usually influenza symptoms are much more intense. With a cold, it’s common to experience mild cold symptoms, like a runny nose and congestion. The flu is more likely to cause body aches, fever and headache, and it may cause serious health problems, like bacterial infections, pneumonia and even hospitalization. Natural flu remedies So, how do you get rid of the flu naturally? Home remedies for the flu include vitamins C and D, herbal supplements, essential oils, probiotics, and eating healthy. Try these natural flu remedies to help relieve your symptoms: 1. Vitamin C (1,000 mg 3–4x daily) Vitamin C helps with immune function and boosts white blood cells. Research shows that vitamin C can shortened the duration of colds and decrease the number of colds in physically active people. Take 1,000 milligrams of vitamin C daily to ward off a cold or the flu and up to 4,000 milligrams daily when you are experiencing symptoms. For the most dietary vitamin C, eat whole fruits and vegetables. 2. Vitamin D3 (2,000 IU daily) Vitamin D is produced in the body by sunlight and regulates the expression of more than 2,000 genes, including those of the immune system. Unfortunately, a large percentage of people are deficient in vitamin D. Recent research suggests that low vitamin D levels are linked to higher rates of cold, flu and respiratory infections. Many physicians believe that current recommended daily amounts of vitamin D are far too low, and 2,000 units rather than 200–400 units per day is a better choice. You can also order home testing kits to test your vitamin D levels. 3. Echinacea (1,000 mg 2–3x daily) This herb can help your body fight off infections, but it is best to take it at the first sign of illness. An extract of echinacea was tested in a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial in 2013. Researchers found that the echinacea effectively treated respiratory tract infections in the short and long term, and it didn’t cause the same resistance as a popular flu medication, oseltamivir, often causes when treating this illness. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in 2000 indicated that drinking five to six cups of echinacea tea per day as soon as upper respiratory symptoms developed, and reducing the number to one cup of tea over a five-day period, was effective for relieving cold and flu symptoms. Echinacea also acts as an anti-inflammatory, which can help reduce bronchial symptoms of cold and flu. It directly attacks yeast and other kinds of fungus. Different preparations have different concentrations of echinacea. Some common preparations and dosages include:Ad Tablets containing 6.78 milligrams of echinacea extract, two tablets three times a day 900 milligrams of echinacea root tincture daily Five to six cups of echinacea tea on the first day of symptoms and then one cup a day thereafter 4. Elderberry (10 mL daily) It is believed that this herb can deactivate the flu virus and naturally boost immunity. The flowers and berries of elderberry are said to boost immunity, treat the flu and relieve sinus pain. Elderberry does seem to attack flu viruses and reduce bronchial inflammation. A preliminary study found that when 15 milliliters of elderberry syrup was taken four times daily for a five-day period, it relieved symptoms of influenza an average of four days earlier than those taking a placebo. 5. Oregano oil (500 mg 2x daily) Oregano oil has a powerful antiviral effect. I like to use oregano oil to fight viral infections, and although there aren’t studies evaluating the efficacy of oregano on influenza specifically, there is research that indicates the powerful antiviral properties of the essential oil. 6. Zinc (50–100 mg daily) Zinc has been shown to support immune function because of its antiviral effects. It works best when taken at the first sign of illness. Zinc may lessen the symptoms of the cold virus, but excessive amounts aren’t good for you. Zinc pills and sprays do not seem to be effective. Take 50–100 milligrams of zinc daily to ward off or treat cold and flu symptoms. 7. Brewer’s yeast This popular supplement contains B vitamins, chromium and protein. Research in Science Direct describes that it’s used for cold, flu and other respiratory tract infections. In fish, brewer’s yeast stimulates immunity by positively influence the microbiome, which may also improve digestive function. Research conducted at the University of Michigan Medical Center found that a yeast supplement was able to reduce cold and flu symptom severity, and it led to significantly shorter duration of symptoms in patients. 8. Essential oils for flu Rubbing peppermint and frankincense essential oil into the neck and bottoms of the feet can naturally support the body’s natural defenses, as indicated in studies. I also like to use clove oil to protect my body against infection and speed recovery from the flu. Research confirms that clove oil has antimicrobial and antioxidant properties. 9. Chiropractic care for flu prevention During the 1918 flu epidemic, flu patients that received chiropractic care survived much more readily than those that didn’t. This is because chiropractic care focuses on the health of your nervous system, which can help boost your immunity. A 2011 study showed some promise for chiropractic adjustments and their potential to help boost immunity. 10. Probiotics Restoring the beneficial bacteria in your gut can help boost your immune system considerably. A lab study conducted in 2017 showed that a particular strain of probiotics, Bacillus bacteria, demonstrated anti-influenza activity, with complete inhibition of the influenza virus. A 2017 systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials evaluated the effects of probiotics and prebiotics on the immune response to the influenza vaccination. The results indicated that participants who took probiotics and prebiotics showed significant improvements in the H1N1 and H3N2 strain protection rates. This suggests that taking probiotics may elevate your immunity. 11. Get fresh air Indoor winter environments can be a source of concentrated toxins and germs. The dry air we inhale as we heat our homes during the winter makes airways more reactive and sensitive to viruses. An added bonus to time spent outdoors in the winter is the extra bit of sunlight you receive. 12. Get enough rest Studies highlight that sleep and immunity and linked. Sleep affects the body’s defense system, and enhancing sleep while fighting an infection can promote your natural defense mechanisms and improve infection outcome. Plus, a stimulation of the immune system triggers a natural inflammatory response, which can induce an increase in sleep duration and intensity. Basically, your body needs the extra sleep to do its work. 13. Stay hydrated Reports actually show that respiratory infections may not directly lead to dehydration, contrary to popular belief. However, even mild dehydration can cause fatigue, headaches and weakness. Sometimes when we are sick and congested, we are less likely to ingest enough fluids. Fluid helps your body to flush bacteria and viruses from your system. Drink approximately half your body weight in ounces daily of either spring water or reverse osmosis filtered water. Warm water can also be soothing to your throat. Herbal teas, like green and black teas, are potent immune system boosters and antioxidants. Try to drink at least eight ounces every two hours. 14. Top foods for flu recovery Also, these are the best foods to consume while you recover from the flu: Light, easy-to-digest foods: Include soups with bone broth, cooked vegetables or herbal teas to help with digestion. Don’t force yourself to eat. Water: Adequate hydration is the key to flushing out the virus from your system. Hot water with lemon, honey and cinnamon: Honey and cinnamon help prevent mucus buildup and keeps you hydrated. Ginger: Make a ginger tea, and add raw honey. Garlic and onions: Both of these vegetable help boost immune function. Conventional treatment Conventional flu treatment includes antiviral drugs and vaccines. The CDC recommends injectable influenza vaccines for everyone over 6 months. Vaccine injections are available as an inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) and a recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV). There are a few things you should know about the flu vaccine ahead of time. For one thing, it doesn’t work right away. It takes about two weeks before it is effective. This is why the CDC recommends getting the vaccine in the fall, before the flu season is at its worst. Another thing you need to know is that you can still get the flu even though you’ve been vaccinated. The virus that’s used to make the vaccine does not always “match” the virus that is circulating the community. The effectiveness of the flu vaccine varies from year to year because flu viruses are constantly changing, which is called antigenic drift, and experts do their best to pick the viruses to include in the vaccine many months before flu season begins. It’s not possible to be 100 percent sure which flu viruses will be most prominent in any given season, so the protection of a flu vaccine is not guaranteed. There are also side effects from getting the flu shot, such as soreness or swelling at the site of the injection, body aches, and fever. The CDC recently made some additions to protect oneself and others against the flu. Some of the recommendations include: Staying home when you’re sick. Staying home if you’ve been exposed to a sick family or household member. Covering your coughs and sneezes with a tissue. Washing your hands or using hand sanitizer. Covering your nose or mouth with a mask or cloth if you are sick and have to be around others at a community gathering of people. Implementing these behaviors can help stop the spread of flu. Risks and side effects If you or a loved one experience complications from the flu, such as pneumonia, or have a high fever that won’t go down, contact your healthcare provider right away. If you catch the flu and you have a chronic condition, such as asthma, or you are pregnant, see your doctor. Also keep in mind that some symptoms of flu and COVID-19 are similar, which makes it hard to tell the difference between the two viruses. For this reason, it’s a good idea to call your healthcare provider and tell him or her about your symptoms over the phone. You will then be advised about what to do next. Most people recover from the flu within a few days to less than two weeks. If you’re still experiencing symptoms after two weeks, contact your healthcare provider. There is the risk of developing complications or a co-infection from the virus and bacteria. Final thoughts The flu is a contagious respiratory illness caused by the influenza virus. The symptoms are typically more severe than the common cold and include body aches, fatigue and headaches. Conventional flu treatment includes antiviral drugs and vaccines, although they are not 100 percent effective. Try natural flu remedies to help relieve your symptoms. Contact your doctor right away if you get the flu and you have a chronic medical condition or you are pregnant. Also, get medical care if you experience flu complications, such as pneumonia.

As respiratory illness season approaches, health experts remind the community that immunization is the best way to prevent serious illness from influenza, COVID-19 and respiratory syncytial virus or RSV. (WVU Photo/Davidson Chan) Download full-size As cooler temperatures arrive and the landscape changes across the region, West Virginia University health experts and care providers encourage residents to practice prevention to promote health and safety in communities statewide in preparation for respiratory illness season. Influenza, COVID-19 and respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, are common, especially in the fall and winter, and vaccination is recommended to help prevent serious illness from all three viruses, reduce widespread illness and lessen the burden on the health care system. Vaccinations for flu, COVID-19 and RSV are currently available and are the best way to prevent severe illness. To ensure protection throughout respiratory illness season, individuals should complete vaccination by the end of October. However, it is important to protect against illness at any time and vaccination later in the season is still recommended. It takes approximately two weeks following vaccination for antibodies to develop and provide protection against infection. “The best way to protect yourself, your loved ones and your community against viruses and other illnesses is to get vaccinated,” Dr. Carmen Burrell, medical director of WVU Student Health Services and Urgent Care, said. “The flu vaccine is one of the most effective ways to reduce the severity of illness, hospitalizations and death, particularly in those who are vulnerable.” Widespread flu vaccination has been utilized as an important public health intervention in the United States for more than 75 years. Each year, the vaccine is updated to protect against the virus strains that are expected to circulate and cause illness in the upcoming season. Annual flu vaccination is recommended for everyone six months and older, with rare exceptions, and it is particularly important for individuals with conditions that could put them at higher risk for serious complications. For the 2023-24 flu season, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported a record number of pediatric deaths attributed to influenza. Similar to the annual flu vaccine formulation, the COVID-19 vaccine is updated to protect against current variants of the virus. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved a newly updated vaccine in August. COVID-19 vaccination is recommended for everyone six months and older, with rare exceptions. In addition to protection against severe disease, hospitalization and death, vaccination helps lower the risk of long COVID. Last year, the FDA approved use of the first RSV vaccine for people 60 years and older and individuals who are pregnant. In addition, an injectable monoclonal antibody that protects against severe RSV is recommended for infants and certain young children. Medical experts in the WVU Pediatric Research Unit were involved in clinical trials to support its development. The vaccine and monoclonal antibody medication protect individuals who are at high risk for severe disease caused by RSV, including life-threatening pneumonia and bronchiolitis. The RSV vaccine is currently not an annual vaccine, meaning older individuals who received the vaccine last year do not need to get another dose at this time. “As a pediatrician and a parent myself, I want to underscore how important it is to make sure your child receives all age-appropriate immunizations,” Dr. Lisa Costello, a WVU Medicine pediatrician and assistant professor in the WVU School of Medicine Department of Pediatrics, said. “Getting all immunizations when due protects our children and our community of parents, grandparents, teachers and caregivers.” Individuals with questions regarding vaccines should communicate with their health care provider. WVU students can reach out to Student Health at 304-285-7200. WVU Medicine Urgent Care offers flu and COVID-19 vaccination opportunities on a walk-in basis. Individuals can also find many walk-in and appointment-based opportunities for all three vaccines in their local community, including primary care providers, local pharmacies and community clinics. To ensure vaccine availability, such as the high-dose influenza vaccine intended for individuals ages 65 and older, individuals may want to call ahead. To receive a flu vaccine, the campus community can visit an upcoming campus clinic from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Wednesday (Oct. 9), Oct. 16 and Oct. 30 in the Student Rec Center or Thursday (Oct. 10), Oct. 17 and Oct. 29 in the Mountainlair Shenandoah Room or WVU Student Health Services located on the Evansdale area of campus during normal operating hours. In addition to vaccination, individuals should follow best practices to prevent all three respiratory illnesses, including: • Wash your hands often with soap and water for 20 seconds or use alcohol-based hand sanitizer. • Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth. Germs are often spread when a person touches something that is contaminated with germs and then touches the eyes, nose or mouth. • Cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue, or the bend of your elbow, not your hands. • Wear a mask to help lower the risk of respiratory virus transmission. • Avoid contact with individuals who are sick, when possible. Following these tips and getting all recommended immunizations when due is the best way to protect yourself and our communities this respiratory illness season. -WVU- ds/jw/10/8/24 MEDIA CONTACT: Jessica WilmothSenior Communications SpecialistWVU Health Sciences Communications and Marketing304-293-9528; Jessica.Wilmoth@mail.wvu.edu Call 1-855-WVU-NEWS for the latest West Virginia University news and information from WVUToday.

(WPTA) - Since the COVID-19 pandemic, immunization rates have decreased on a nation-wide scale. As cold and flu season approaches during this time of year, officials recommend for people to protect themselves and those around them with the annual influenza vaccination.Local entities in Allen County are dedicated to ensuring that residents have access to the flu shot to decrease the impact of illness. Super Shot leaders of Fort Wayne said approximately 40% of people in Allen County are receiving their flu shots, which is low in comparison to years prior. The Allen County Public Library and Super Shot have partnered together since 2021. This year, they are working together to make the flu vaccination more accessible to the public with a series of clinics hosted during October. The vaccines are available at all nine of their library branches for patients 6 months and older. This is the first year that the vaccination clinics are hosted at each library site, which leaders said is effective for keeping the community safe and providing efficient ways for people to receive their seasonal shot. Super Shot partners with Allen County Public Health to hold the community accountable for bringing flu vaccination records up from previous years with their Healthy Hoosiers campaign. The campaign is a community flu challenge throughout the Allen County to record the number of people across the county that are receiving their shot this season. Each week, Super Shot and Allen County Public Health receive the totals to add to their goal of vaccinating 150,000 patrons with the flu shot. Those receiving their annual flu shot need a form of identification and their health insurance card. If anyone receiving their shot does not have health insurance, they will have to pay a $15 vaccination fee for each shot, but officials said they will not turn anyone away for an inability to pay. Super Shot does not require any scheduled appointments for vaccinations. Call their office number at 260-424-SHOT (7468) or head to their website for an appointment or more information.

Join the upcoming 2024 Avian Influenza Summit where global experts will discuss integrated risk management against emerging highly pathogenic strains compromising welfare and profitability in your operation:Risk factors & epidemiological updates.Effective governmental policies. Integrated risk management.Best practices with vaccination.Since 2005, Avian Influenza has caused over 500 million birds lost globally. Its devastating impact extends beyond domestic and wild birds, threatening livelihoods, food security and public health. The recent shift in the disease’s ecology is also triggering unusual die-offs in wild birds and led to an alarming increase in mammalian cases. The rapidly evolving nature of avian influenza and changes in its patterns of spread require a review of existing prevention and control strategies. To effectively contain the disease, protect the economic sustainability of the poultry sector and reduce potential pandemic risks, all available tools must be reconsidered including vaccination.1A recent research project funded by EU, namely DELTA-FLU, a 5-year pan-European study to determine the key viral, host-related, and environmental factors that determine the dynamics of avian influenza (AI) in poultry and other host species. The research showed the new cases of bird flu are frequently due to human activity, rather than direct infection from the wild birds. 2 People carry the virus into premises on contaminated shoes, clothes, machines, animal feed and bedding.3When it comes to vaccination, antigenic distance between vaccines and field strains is essential, requiring rapid updates of vaccines to match circulating strains. Planning vaccination requires selecting the most adequate vaccine type and vaccination scheme. Preventive vaccination should prioritise achieving the highest protection, especially for the most susceptible species in high-risk transmission areas.4 In this context, discussing best practices are the foundation to effectively tackle these major viruses compromising food security and public health globally.REFERENCES1.

Search form Search New vaccine available for the 2024-25 flu season A new vaccine that fights three strains of influenza is now available from health care providers across the U.S. The most effective way to fight the flu is to get vaccinated, says the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). While the virus can spread among the population during the entire year, the flu season is generally in the fall and winter. The peak months for the flu are December through February. While the CDC recommends you get an annual flu vaccine by the end of October, any time you get it before the peak months will help. Everyone 6 months of age and older should receive the vaccine to reduce their risk of getting influenza and decrease the flu’s potentially serious complications. The following groups have a higher risk of developing serious flu-related complications, so vaccination is especially important: Adults 65-years and older Adults with certain chronic health conditions, such as asthma, heart disease and stroke, diabetes and chronic kidney disease Pregnant women - changes to the immune system, heart and lungs during pregnancy make people more susceptible to potentially serious flu complications. Flu may also be harmful to a developing baby. When you get vaccinated, you reduce your risk of getting sick with flu and possibly being hospitalized due to serious complications. Most people need only one dose of the flu vaccine each season, but children aged 6 months to 8 years may need two doses. These children include: Children getting vaccinated for the first time Those who have only previously received one dose of flu vaccine Those whose flu vaccination history is unknown It is recommended they get the first dose as soon as the vaccine is available, because the second dose needs to be given at least four weeks after the first. In addition, pregnant women in their third trimester should get vaccinated to protect their baby during flu season. Consult your health care provider for specific recommendations about this year’s flu vaccine. For more information on the 2024 flu vaccines, visit Seasonal Flu Vaccines | CDC.

Research Letter: Influenza A(H5N1) Virus Resilience in Milk after Thermal Inactivation. Image Credit: Lik Studio / Shutterstock In a recent study published in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases, researchers evaluated the resilience of the highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) virus in milk under pasteurization-like temperatures and assessed the effectiveness of thermal inactivation. Background H5N1 influenza is enzootic in many bird populations and can infect mammals, including humans, leading to severe or fatal outcomes in some cases. The detection of H5N1 virus in United States (U.S.) dairy cows has raised significant public health concerns. Pasteurization, a widely used method to ensure milk safety, involves heating milk to eliminate harmful bacteria. In the U.S., low-temperature long-time (LTLT) and high-temperature short-time (HTST) pasteurization are common processes. However, recent studies have shown conflicting results regarding the efficacy of pasteurization-like conditions, indicating that unpasteurized milk from H5N1-infected cows may contain sufficient virus to infect susceptible animals. These findings highlight the potential risk to human health, and further research is needed to fully understand the virus's resilience and improve safety measures. About the study Researchers evaluated the effects of different temperatures on influenza virus viability in milk. It is important to note that the test tube conditions used in the experiment do not precisely replicate actual pasteurization processes in the dairy industry, and this presents a key limitation of the study. Four influenza virus strains were used in the study: one laboratory-adapted strain (PR8) and three H5N1 strains. Commercially available pasteurized whole milk (3.25% fat) was spiked with virus strains at a concentration of 108 50% tissue culture infectious dose/mL of milk or Optimized Minimum Essential Medium (Opti-MEM) control media. The samples were subjected to three distinct heat treatments: 63°C for 30 minutes, 72°C for 20 seconds, and 91°C for 20 seconds. Different volumes of the spiked samples (200 μL, 20 μL, and 2 μL) were used to assess how volume might influence the effectiveness of heat treatments. Additionally, the PR8 strain was tested in both pasteurized and unpasteurized milk to examine the impact of preheating milk at 37°C for 1 minute before exposure to HTST conditions. After the heat treatments, the samples were adjusted to a final volume of 200 μL and titrated to determine viral viability. Study results Human-to-human transmission of H5N1 remains rare, but the virus is regarded as a significant pandemic threat. The researchers found no significant difference in viral titers between influenza viruses diluted in control media and those diluted in milk. All three viruses tested- PR8, VN/04 ΔH5N1, and ty/IN/22- behaved similarly. However, it is essential to emphasize that these findings are based on controlled laboratory settings, which may not fully capture the complexities of real-world dairy processing. Heat treatment at 63°C for 30 minutes effectively decreased viral viability below the limit of detection. At 72°C for 20 seconds, titer reduction was inversely proportional to the sample volume, with a non-significant decrease in 200 μL samples, but significant reduction in 20 μL and 2 μL samples. A similar trend was observed with treatment at 91°C for 20 seconds, where smaller sample volumes showed greater viral inactivation. Preheating the samples to 37°C for 1 minute before applying HTST conditions accelerated viral inactivation, particularly in smaller volumes. The study further explored the impact of different types of milk and storage temperatures on virus stability. Pasteurized, unpasteurized colostrum and mature milk were spiked with viruses and stored at different temperatures for up to four days. The viruses remained infectious for more than four days in unpasteurized milk at temperatures below 63°C, where viral inactivation occurred within 24 hours. Unpasteurized colostrum milk showed enhanced viral inactivation, possibly due to the presence of immunoglobulins, which provide a natural defense. Stability of influenza A in retail and unpasteurized milk. We diluted influenza A viruses in either Opti-Mem control media (Fisher Scientific, https://www.fishersci.com) (A), retail off-the-shelf pasteurized whole milk (B), or 2 different sources of unpasteurized milk: colostrum milk (C) or mature milk (D). We then incubated 200-μL samples for several days at various temperatures, as shown. We subsequently titrated samples by TCID50 in MDCK cells. We tested 3 strains: PR8 (H1N1), ty/IN/22 (H5N1), and the reverse genetics version of TX/24 (H5N1). Unpasteurized colostrum milk produced during the first few days after birth contains high levels of immunoglobulins and antimicrobial peptides that might have had an effect in decreasing virus survival. PR8 (H1N1), wild-type strain A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1); RT, room temperature; TCID50, 50% tissue culture infectious dose; TX/24, wild-type strain A/Texas/37/2024 (H5N1); ty/IN/22, wild-type highly pathogenic strain Aurkey/Indiana/3707-003/2022 (H5N1). Nevertheless, a critical limitation is that spiking viruses into milk does not fully replicate the dynamics of a natural infection scenario. Enveloped viruses, such as influenza, are generally less stable than non-enveloped viruses, which have been more thoroughly studied in similar settings. This limitation underscores the need for further investigation into how viral inactivation in milk behaves under real-world conditions. Despite these findings, it is important to recognize that the presence of viral Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) in milk samples without viable viruses may be due to the sensitivity of modern detection methods rather than actual risk. Previous studies investigating HTST-like temperature conditions have produced mixed results. For instance, one study found that complete viral inactivation occurred only at 105°C, whereas another study demonstrated total inactivation using HTST conditions. These conflicting results highlight the complexity of viral resilience under varying thermal conditions. The current study adds valuable insight but must be interpreted in the context of these prior findings, emphasizing the importance of further research in this area. The evidence indicates that HTST pasteurization can effectively inactivate the influenza virus, reducing the risk in milk supplies. However, due to the experimental limitations discussed earlier, caution is still warranted, and definitively ruling out the presence of live virus may require multiple blind passages in eggs, as is standard in surveillance studies. The study’s findings, particularly with the PR8 strain, could serve as a valuable reference for evaluating commercial pasteurization processes. Nonetheless, the study highlights that further real-world testing is essential to ensure the robustness of these processes under industry conditions. Understanding the factors influencing virus survival in milk will help guide interventions to improve milk safety and address concerns about emerging viral threats. Conclusions To summarize, the study demonstrates that pasteurization at standard temperatures, such as 63°C for 30 minutes and 72°C for 20 seconds, can reduce the viability of H5N1 in milk, particularly in smaller volumes. However, the study’s limitations regarding experimental conditions and previous conflicting data must be considered. Viral inactivation was more pronounced in smaller sample volumes and enhanced by preheating. Additionally, the resilience of the virus in unpasteurized milk underscores the importance of vigilant heat treatment processes in commercial dairy practices.

Opens in a new tab or window email article The first two human cases of H5N1 avian influenza in California were confirmed by CDC testing of specimens submitted by the state on Thursday, and a California-led investigation is underway. At the same time, testing for antibodies that would confirm spread among contacts of an unusual case in Missouri will begin soon, with results expected in mid- to late October. On a press call Friday morning, CDC officials explained why this case is taking time to investigate. First Human Cases in California California reported its first H5N1 outbreaks in dairy cows in August. The two infected humans confirmed in the state on Thursday brings the total to 16 cases nationally this year, said Nirav Shah, MD, JD, principal deputy director of the CDC, during a call with reporters on Friday. Demetre Daskalakis, MD, MPH, the director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases who was also on the call, explained that six of the 16 cases -- including the two newly reported cases in California -- have been tied to outbreaks in dairy cows. Nine cases linked back to "poultry depopulation activities" in Colorado were reported in July. The Missouri case has an unknown origin. According to Shah, the California patients were farm workers at two separate dairy farms already known to have outbreaks of avian influenza among their cattle. The cases were discovered through "active symptom monitoring," which is a strategy California and its local county health departments are continuing for exposed workers where outbreaks have been detected, he added. Both of the individuals with confirmed H5N1 experienced mild symptoms, including conjunctivitis; neither reported respiratory issues, and neither individual was hospitalized. One individual said they believed they might have had a fever, Shah noted. "Both individuals were tested, offered antiviral treatment, and are recovering," he added. In the meantime, a public health investigation is underway. The CDC will work alongside California's public health officials to investigate the two confirmed cases and monitor for other possible cases. Household contacts -- other dairy workers -- have been contacted by public health officials or will be contacted for follow-up interviews, Shah said. "There is no known epidemiological link between these two cases, and thus, based on what we know right now, these cases are separate instances of animal-to-human spread of the virus," Shah said. He stressed that the discovery of these two cases was "not unexpected" and that the CDC's risk assessment for the general public "continues to be low." Two weeks ago, California had 16 positive cattle herds; today it has 56, he said. "If there are more herds that test positive, there are more workers who are exposed. And where there are more workers who are exposed, the chances of human infection increase," he said. Mystery Case in Missouri Meanwhile, investigators continue to explore another human case identified in Missouri on September 6, with no known exposure to either an infected animal or animal products. The public health response included "intensive interviews" of the patient and their household contacts as well as an infection control investigation at the hospital where the patient was admitted. The interviews did not identify a known source of exposure to the H5N1 virus, but did find a household contact who had been sick with similar symptoms to the identified case and experienced symptoms simultaneously, "implying a common exposure rather than human-to-human transmission," Daskalakis said. Missouri public health officials also conducted a retrospective investigation at the hospital, which identified 112 healthcare workers who interacted with the patient. Six of the 112 healthcare workers reported respiratory symptoms. One had been given an influenza PCR test, which was negative. The other five had recovered, and didn't have PCR testing. Missouri obtained blood specimens for each of these individuals to conduct antibody testing by the CDC to investigate "the unlikely possibility that their symptoms were related to H5 infection resulting from their interaction with the patient," Daskalakis said. Antibody tests for H5 aren't commercially available. For 3 weeks, the CDC has been developing a specific antibody test to match the Missouri virus, which is part of the reason serology testing has required more time, Daskalakis said. The process is expected to be completed by Monday, at which point serology testing of samples will begin. Conclusive serology testing results are expected by mid- to late October, Daskalakis said. "CDC is moving at a very accelerated pace, while conducting rigorous science to assure the validity of these results," he said. CDC is also revising its H5 protocol to address evidence of "cross-reactivity" between seasonal H1 antibodies and H5N1 viruses, which is one more step being taken to ensure the test's accuracy and avoid a false positive result, he said.

Ogden mother Erika Carr dies after raising $1M for her children’s future UDAF officials are working with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Inspection Service (APHIS) in their response to the situation. There will reportedly be additional surveillance and testing in areas around the affected flock. “Poultry owners should vigilantly watch their flocks for symptoms of HPAI, which include high death loss among flocks, nasal discharge, decreased appetite or water consumption, and lack of coordination in birds,” a press release from the UDAF states. “If birds are experiencing any of these symptoms, please contact the State Veterinarian’s office immediately at statevet@utah.gov.” The recent HPAI detections do not pose an immediate public health concern, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Officials are reminding the public that “proper handling and cooking of all poultry and eggs to an internal temperature of 165˚F is recommended as a general food safety precaution.” Anyone involved in poultry production of any size should review the health of their birds and implement the proper precautions to ensure their safety, according to the UDAF. Information about biosecurity, including videos, checklists, and a toolkit, is available on the UDAF website. No further information is available at this time. Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc.

How well do they work?Oct. 10, 2024Media ContactJacob GnieskiAsc. Dir., Media Relations & Health Sciences CommunicationsGet ready for this year’s respiratory virus season with combination flu and COVID-19 tests, now widely available. Learn more about how these tests could impact your family’s health this flu season.— Getty ImagesAs respiratory virus season arrives in the U.S., a new tool could be a game-changer for families: over-the-counter combination tests that can detect both flu and COVID-19 with a single sample. These tests became available last year, but this is the first flu season where this type of test will be widely available.The combination tests offer a convenient way to quickly check for both viruses at home, but how reliable are they and how should they be used?Here in Atlanta, researchers at Emory University, Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta, Georgia Institute of Technology and Grady Health System have played a pivotal role in evaluating these combination tests through the National Institutes of Health’s (NIH) Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics (RADx) and Independent Test Assessment Programs (ITAP), which select and test the most promising diagnostic tools and then help them move quickly through the development, approval and commercialization pipeline.Greg Martin, MD, MSc The Atlanta Center for Microsystems Engineered Point-of-Care Technologies (ACME POCT), led by researchers at Emory University, helped test seven of the eight combination tests for flu and COVID-19 that are now available on store shelves. Almost every test on the market went through Emory channels, making the university a key contributor in bringing these products to the public. Greg Martin, MD, MSc, a principal investigator in the ACME/RADx initiative at Emory and director of pulmonary and critical care medicine, shares insights into how these tests work, their reliability, and what to expect as respiratory viruses circulate. Having directly evaluated these combination tests, Martin offers valuable firsthand knowledge that families can use to prepare.Q: What can we expect from this year’s respiratory virus season?Dr. Martin: It’s difficult to predict exactly how the season will play out, but we do know that the flu will circulate starting this fall, as it does every year. On average, the flu causes 30,000-50,000 deaths in the U.S. annually, so it’s important to remember that it’s not just a mild illness — it can be deadly. Here in Atlanta, we can expect that tens of thousands of people will get the flu. Some may have mild cases, especially if they’ve been vaccinated, but it will still impact a significant portion of our community.Q: Can I test myself for COVID-19 and the flu at the same time?Dr. Martin: For the first time this flu season, you’ll have access to eight different over-the-counter (OTC) combination tests that you can use to test yourself and your family for both COVID-19 and the flu at home. These tests can differentiate between influenza A, influenza B and COVID-19, all from a single nasal swab. It’s a convenient way to get quick results and determine which virus you or your family members may have.Q: Can you explain why the new combination tests are significant for consumers, especially during respiratory virus season?Dr. Martin: The significance of these tests lies in their ability to help you differentiate what’s causing your illness. This is especially valuable during cold and flu season, when many respiratory viruses have similar symptoms. Once you know the cause of your illness, you can take the appropriate next steps, like contacting your doctor for treatment options. Both COVID-19 and flu have antiviral treatments that work best when started early, so finding out early which virus you have can help you get the right care quickly.It’s also important to follow the instructions closely for the most accurate results. Depending on the test, results are typically ready for interpretation within 10-30 minutes, so make sure you check the timing guidelines provided in the instructions.Q: Who can use these combination tests?Dr. Martin: These tests are designed for both kids and adults. Parents can perform the test on children as young as two years old, while anyone 14 and older can test themselves. It's important to refer to the specific instructions provided with the test to ensure proper use, as instructions and applicable ages will vary slightly by manufacturer.Q: Where can I get the tests, and how much do they cost?Dr. Martin: The combination tests are readily available at common places like CVS, Walgreens and other local pharmacies. You can also find them online at retailers like Amazon or Walmart.The Healgen Rapid Check COVID-19/Flu A&B Antigen Test is one of eight combination tests currently available.HealgenIn terms of cost, most of these tests are priced similarly, around $10-12 per test. Some may be sold in packs of two or four, but when you break it down, it averages about $10-$12 per individual test. They are typically purchased out-of-pocket. However, if you have a health savings account (HSA) or a flexible spending account (FSA), you can use those to reimburse the cost, as these are considered health-related expenses.Q: How accurate are the combination tests?Dr. Martin: All these tests have gone through the same rigorous approval process, which means they meet a certain threshold for accuracy that is established by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). They are all held to the same standards, so their effectiveness is similar across the board. Over the past few years, the performance of these types of tests has improved, so you can feel confident that they provide reliable results for both COVID-19 and flu detection.Q: When should I use the combination test?Dr. Martin: The best time to use a combination test is during cold and flu season, when multiple viruses like COVID-19, influenza A and influenza B are circulating. If you have respiratory symptoms, it’s a good idea to use a combo test to determine whether you have COVID-19 or the flu, especially since the symptoms can overlap. However, there are some situations where a single COVID-19 test might make sense, like if you’ve been directly exposed to someone with known COVID-19 and you start developing symptoms. That said, the cost difference between combination tests and single COVID-19 tests is usually minimal, so I tend to favor having the combination test on hand.It’s important to use these tests early in the course of your symptoms, ideally within the first few days, because treatments for both COVID-19 and the flu are most effective when started early.Q: What should I do if I test positive for COVID-19 or the flu?Dr. Martin: If you test positive for either COVID-19 or the flu, the first thing to do is take precautions to prevent spreading it to others. Practice good hygiene, isolate as much as possible from others in your home, and follow general cleaning practices to reduce the risk of transmission to your family.It’s also important to contact your health care provider, especially if you have risk factors for severe illness. Conditions like chronic lung disease, heart disease, cancer, diabetes, high blood pressure, being overweight or simply being older can increase your risk, so it’s important to let your health care provider know you’ve tested positive. They can guide you on next steps, which may include antiviral treatments that are most effective when started early.I also recommend checking the latest CDC guidelines for specific recommendations, as they can change depending on current data.If you test negative, the FDA recommends repeat testing 48 hours following a negative result whether or not you have COVID-19 symptoms. A follow-up test can give you extra reassurance that it’s not COVID-19 or the flu, reducing the risk of missing someone who may be positive for COVID-19 or flu.Q: What types of testing and resources are available at Emory, and how can people access these services?Dr. Martin: As a national test verification center, Emory offers both the Atlanta community and surrounding areas access to valuable testing resources. We validate and verify the performance of new diagnostic tests, but we also provide free testing services to the public for COVID-19, flu and RSV. If you’re interested in getting tested, you can visit our website and sign up for an appointment. We’ll test you for these viruses, or if you're curious about using the latest at-home tests, you can even help evaluate those new tests. This is a free service, and we often compensate people for their time when they participate in our project to validate the latest tests.To participate or learn more about these services, you can sign up at our website: Emory ­­RADx COVID-19, Flu and RSV Test Research Study.Skip sidebar content PrintRelated StoriesEmory receives $15.4 million NIH grant to see if COVID tests detect variantsJan. 31, 2022Subscribe to Emory NewsTagsHealth CoronavirusInfluenzaResearchPublic HealthDept. of Pulmonary, Allergy, Critical Care and Sleep MedicineSchool of MedicineWoodruff Health Sciences CenterRecent NewsDownload Emory News PhotoBy downloading Emory news media, you agree to the following terms of use:Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public LicenseBy exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License ("Public License").

IDWeek will take place in-person in Los Angeles, California from Oct. 16-19, 2024. Despite the development of antibiotics in the last century, AMR continues to pose a threat to patient health with millions of deaths each year globally. Combatting and eliminating AMR requires innovation beyond antibiotics. Longhorn is developing LHNVD-303 as an approach that prevents treatment-resistant bacteria strains through a targeted cocktail of lipoteichoic acid, lipopolysaccharide and peptidoglycan. The company will present the following posters: Poster Title: A Single Composite Peptide Vaccine Comprising Conserved Influenza Epitopes Formulated with ALFQ Adjuvant Induced Broadly Reactive Antibodies to Human, Avian, and Swine Influenza Viruses Presenter: Clara J.

Lackey Shaffer Oct 10, 2024 Oct 10, 2024 Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email “Getting your flu shot is crucial this year,” says Dr. Jeffery Davies, medical director of the emergency department at Dignity Health - St. John’s Hospitals. (Submitted) Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save Flu season is nearly upon us. Cases of influenza tend to peak between December and February, but cases are frequently seen as early as October. Which is why Dignity Health, which operates St. John’s Regional Medical Center in Oxnard as well as St. John’s Hospital Camarillo, is dedicated to keeping Ventura County residents informed and, hopefully, healthy.Prevention is worth a pound of cure, it is said, and thus Dignity Health physicians are urging everyone to “take proactive steps to protect themselves and their loved ones against influenza,” the organization stated via press release.According to Dr. Jeffery Davies, medical director of the emergency department at Dignity Health - St. John’s Hospitals, vaccination is the best defense. “Getting your flu shot is crucial this year,” Davies said. “The flu is a serious illness, especially for the elderly and those who are immunocompromised, like cancer or transplant patients. It can lead to severe complications and even death, with up to 50,000 fatalities annually.” Furthermore, Davies emphasized the importance of early vaccination.In addition to vaccination, Dignity Health experts recommend the following preventive measures:• Practice good hand hygiene by washing hands frequently. • Avoid close contact with sick individuals.• Stay home if you’re feeling unwell to prevent spreading illness.• Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your elbow when coughing or sneezing.All of these habits are healthy ones, whether it is flu season or not, and can help people avoid other illnesses as well as influenza. But for the flu itself, Dignity Health physicians reiterated that the flu vaccine plays a pivotal role in preventing significant flu-related illnesses, including hospitalization and death.“The vaccine is your best shot at reducing your risk of ending up in the hospital or worse,” Davies said. “Together, we can work to reduce the impact of flu season in our community.”Dignity Health – St. John’s Regional Medical Center, DignityHealth.org/StJohnsRegional.

Nova Scotians are now able to book appointments for the flu and COVID-19 vaccines. (Communications Nova Scotia / File) Nova Scotians can now book appointments for the COVID-19 and influenza vaccines. These safe, effective and free vaccines are recommended for everyone aged six months and older. “Getting vaccinated against respiratory illnesses like influenza and COVID-19 can help prevent serious illness and unnecessary hospital visits,” said Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia’s Chief Medical Officer of Health. “It is particularly important for people at increased risk of severe disease to get vaccinated, including older adults, young infants and toddlers, and people with chronic health conditions. Anyone who is in regular contact with someone from any of these groups should also get vaccinated.” Nova Scotians can get the influenza and COVID-19 vaccines from participating family doctors, nurse practitioners, family practice nurses, pharmacies, public health offices and mobile units. People have several options for booking an appointment: online at: https:/ovascotia.ca/vaccination through the YourHealthNS app by calling 1-833-797-7772 by calling their primary care provider. This year, family booking is available, which allows someone to book up to six people for a single appointment. If people find their preferred time and location are not available, they are encouraged to check back in a few days, as appointments will be added regularly. People using the toll-free number in the next few days should also be aware that there may be a wait because of large call volumes. During this respiratory illness season, Nova Scotia has additional focus on older adults. An enhanced influenza vaccine, which is shown to provide better protection for older adults, is available to people aged 65 and older. And in November, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccines will be available to Nova Scotians aged 60 and older living in licensed long-term care facilities, as well as hospital inpatients that age who are awaiting placement in long-term care. This fall, COVID-19 testing guidance is changing to align with eligibility for COVID-19 medications, which benefit people at higher risk for severe disease or hospitalization. Both polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and rapid testing will be focused on those at higher risk, such as people who are 65 years of age and older or immunocompromised. People at higher risk can access rapid and PCR tests by booking an appointment online at https://covidbooking.nshealth.ca or by calling 1-833-797-7772. Full details of the testing eligibility criteria and availability can be found at: https://www.nshealth.ca/coronavirustesting Influenza and COVID-19 symptoms can include a sudden high fever, headache, general aches and pains, fatigue and weakness, a runny, stuffy nose, sneezing and sore throat. Quotes: “Now that COVID-19 is part of our everyday lives, we need to prioritize testing and treatment for those who need it most, as we do with all infectious diseases. The goal is to reduce the number of vulnerable patients seeking primary care, visiting emergency departments and needing hospitalization. People who need a test will be able to access them, but for most people, having COVID-19 should be treated like any other respiratory virus.” — Dr. Shelly McNeil, Medical Director, Emerging and Re-Emerging Infections Network (ERIN), Nova Scotia Health Quick Facts: the influenza and COVID-19 vaccines are updated annually to protect against the latest strains of influenza and COVID-19 children younger than nine years old who have never had an influenza vaccine should receive two doses four weeks apart it is recommended to wait six months after having a COVID-19 infection or vaccine before receiving the updated vaccine, though people may get it after three months if they wish Nova Scotians can access their vaccine records via the YourHealthNS app and online at https://vaxrecordns.nshealth.ca Additional Resources: More information on vaccines and bookings for both influenza and COVID-19 is available at: https://www.nshealth.ca/seasonal-vaccines More information on influenza: https:/ovascotia.ca/flu More information on COVID-19 and testing: https://www.nshealth.ca/coronavirusvaccine Other than cropping, CNS photos are not to be altered in any way Follow Us Twitter Facebook YouTube All government social media accounts Footer Privacy Terms Crown copyright © Government of Nova ScotiaGenetic Tests Are Detecting Prevalence of Bird Flu Virus in US Wastewater and Allowing Officials to Track its Spread - Dark Daily About Dark Daily Contact Us Subscribe to E-Briefings Search for: News, Analysis, Trends, Management Innovations for Clinical Laboratories and Pathology Groups Hosted by Robert Michel HOME DARK REPORT RESOURCE FINDER SPECIAL REPORTS EBRIEFINGS WEBINAR WHITE PAPERS STAFF TRAINING LEAD GENERATION PRESS SIGN IN ABOUT DARK DAILY CONTACT US JOIN News, Analysis, Trends, Management Innovations for Clinical Laboratories and Pathology Groups Hosted by Robert Michel HOME DARK REPORT RESOURCE FINDER SPECIAL REPORTS EBRIEFINGS WEBINARS WHITE PAPERS STAFF TRAINING LEAD GENERATION PRESS SIGN IN Genetic Tests Are Detecting Prevalence of Bird Flu Virus in US Wastewater and Allowing Officials to Track its Spread Oct 7, 2024 | Laboratory Pathology, Laboratory Resources, Laboratory Testing, Molecular Diagnostics, Genetic Testing, Whole Gene Sequencing, Precision Medicine Though PCR clinical laboratory testing is widely used, some scientists are concerned its specificity may limit the ability to identify all variants of bird flu in wastewaterWastewater testing of infectious agents appears to be here to stay. At the same time, there are differences of opinion about which methodologies and clinical laboratory tests are best suited to screen for specific contagions in wastewater. One such contagion is avian influenza, the virus that causes bird flu.Wastewater testing by public health officials became a valuable tool during the COVID-19 pandemic and has now become a common method for detecting other diseases as well. For example, earlier this year, scientists used wastewater testing to learn how the H5N1 variant of the bird flu virus was advancing among dairy herds across the country.In late March, the bird flu was first detected in dairy cattle in Texas, prompting scientists to begin examining wastewater samples to track the virus. Some researchers, however, expressed concerns about the ability of sewage test assays to detect all variants of certain diseases.“Right now we are using these sort of broad tests to test for influenza A viruses,” Denis Nash, PhD, Distinguished Professor of Epidemiology at City University of New York (CUNY) and Executive Director of CUNY’s Institute for Implementation Science in Population Health (SPH), told the Los Angeles Times. “It’s possible there are some locations around the country where the primers being used in these tests might not work for H5N1.” Clinical laboratory PCR genetic testing is most commonly used to screen for viruses in wastewater. (Photo copyright: CUNY SPH.)Effectiveness of PCR Wastewater TestingPolymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests are most commonly used to distinguish genetic material related to a specific illness such as the flu virus. For PCR tests to correctly identify a virus, the tests must be designed to look for a specific subtype. The two most prevalent human influenza A viruses are known as H1N1 (swine flu) and H3N2, which was responsible for the 1968 pandemic that killed a million people worldwide. The “H” stands for hemagglutinin and the “N” for neuraminidase.Hemagglutinin is a glycoprotein that assists the virus to attach to and infect host cells. Neuraminidase is an enzyme found in many pathogenic or symbiotic microorganisms that separates the links between neuraminic acids in various molecules.Avian flu is also an influenza A virus, but it has the subtype H5N1. Although human and bird flu viruses both contain the N1 signal, they do not share an H. Some scientists fear that—in cases where a PCR test only looks for H1 and H3 in wastewater—that test could miss the bird flu altogether.“We don’t have any evidence of that. It does seem like we’re at a broad enough level that we don’t have any evidence that we would not pick up H5,” Jonathan Yoder, Deputy Director, Infectious Disease Readiness and Innovation at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) told the Los Angeles Times.The CDC asserts current genetic testing methods are standardized and will detect the bird flu. Yoder also affirmed the tests being used at all the testing sites are the same assay, based on information the CDC has published regarding testing for influenza A viruses. Genetic Sequencing Finds H5N1 in Texas WastewaterIn an article published on the preprint server medRxiv titled, “Virome Sequencing Identifies H5N1 Avian Influenza in Wastewater from Nine Cities,” the authors wrote, “using an agnostic, hybrid-capture sequencing approach, we report the detection of H5N1 in wastewater in nine Texas cities, with a total catchment area population in the millions, over a two-month period from March 4th to April 25th, 2024.”The authors added, “Although human to human transmission is rare, infection has been fatal in nearly half of patients who have contracted the virus in past outbreaks. The increasing presence of the virus in domesticated animals raises substantial concerns that viral adaptation to immunologically naïve humans may result in the next flu pandemic.”“So, it’s not just targeting one virus—or one of several viruses—as one does with PCR testing,” Eric Boerwinkle, PhD, Dean of the UTHealth Houston School of Public Health told the LA Times. “We’re actually in a very complex mixture, which is wastewater, pulling down viruses and sequencing them. What’s critical here is it’s very specific to H5N1.”Epidemiologist Blake Hanson, PhD, Assistant Professor, Department of Epidemiology, Human Genetics, and Environmental Sciences at the UT Health Houston Graduate School of Biomedical Science, agreed with Boerwinkle that though the PCR-based methodology is highly effective at detecting avian flu in wastewater samples, the testing can do more.“We have the ability to look at the representation of the entire genome, not just a marker component of it. And so that has allowed us to look at H5N1, differentiate it from some of our seasonal fluids like H1N1 and H3N2,” Hanson told the LA Times. “It’s what gave us high confidence that it is entirely H5N1, whereas the other papers are using a part of the H5 gene as a marker for H5.”Human or Animal SourcesBoth Boerwinkle and Hanson are epidemiologists in the team studying wastewater samples for H5N1 in Texas. They are not sure where the virus originated but are fairly certain it did not come from humans.“Texas is really a confluence of a couple of different flyways for migratory birds, and Texas is also an agricultural state, despite having quite large cities,” Boerwinkle noted. “It’s probably correct that if you had to put your dime and gamble what was happening, it’s probably coming from not just one source but from multiple sources. We have no reason to think that one source is more likely any one of those things.”“Because we are looking at the entirety of the genome, when we look at the single human H5N1 case, the genomic sequence has a hallmark amino acid change, compared to all of the cattle from that same time point,” Hanson said. “We do not see that hallmark amino acid present in any of our sequencing data. And we’ve looked very carefully for that, which gives us some confidence that we’re not seeing human-human transmission.”CDC Updates on Bird FluIn its weekly updates on the bird flu situation, the CDC reported that 48 states have outbreaks in poultry and 14 states have avian flu outbreaks in dairy cows. More than 238 dairy herds have been affected and, as of September 20, over 100 million poultry have been affected by the disease.In addition, the CDC monitored more than 4,900 people who came into contact with an infected animal. Though about 230 of those individuals have been tested for the disease, there have only been a total of 14 reported human cases in the US.The CDC posts information specifically for laboratory workers, healthcare providers, and veterinarians on its website.The CDC also states that the threat from avian flu to the general public is low. Individuals at an increased risk for infection include people who work around infected animals and those who consume products containing raw, unpasteurized cow’s milk.Symptoms of H5N1 in humans may include fever or chills, cough, headaches, muscle or body aches, runny or stuffy nose, tiredness and shortness of breath. Symptoms typically surface two to eight days after exposure.Scientists and researchers have been seeking a reliable clinical laboratory test for disease organisms in a fast, accurate, and cost-effective manner. Wastewater testing of infectious agents could fulfill those goals and appears to be a technology that will continue to be used for tracking disease.—JP SchlingmanRelated Information:As National Wastewater Testing Expands, Texas Researchers Identify Bird Flu in Nine CitiesExperts Blast CDC over Failure to Test Sewage for Signs of H5N1 Bird Flu VirusFrom Sewage to Safety: Hospital Wastewater Surveillance as a Beacon for Defense Against H5N1 Bird FluThe Bird Flu Outbreak Has Spread to Humans: Are We Too Late to Prevent the Next Pandemic?Detection of Hemagglutinin H5 Influenza A Virus Sequence in Municipal Wastewater Solids at Wastewater Treatment Plants with Increases in Influenza A in Spring, 2024Virome Sequencing Identifies H5N1 Avian Influenza in Wastewater from Nine CitiesWastewater Analysis Continues to Be an Effective Tool for Tracking Deadly Infectious Diseases in Human CommunitiesGenetic Testing of Wastewater Now Common in Detecting New Strains of COVID-19 and Other Infectious DiseasesSan Francisco International Airport First in the Nation to Test Wastewater for SARS-CoV-2 CoronavirusNew, Cryptic COVID-19 Lineage Found in Ohio Wastewater by Molecular Virologist Tracking Spread of SARS-CoV-2 Variants Lab Resources CategoriesLaboratory Resources Clinical Laboratory Compliance Consultants Clinical Laboratory/ Pathology Coding, Billing, and Collection Resources Clinical Laboratory/Pathology Automation, Analyzers, Testing Systems Clinical Laboratory/Pathology Management Consultants Clinical Laboratory/Pathology Management Recruiters & Staffing Resources Lab and Pathology Mergers, Acquisitions, Valuations Lean Six Sigma, ISO 15189, Quality Management Consultants Molecular Diagnostics, Genetic Testing, Whole Gene Sequencing The Dark Intelligence Group 21806 Briarcliff Dr. Spicewood, TX 78669 Email: info@darkreport.com Phone: 512-264-7103 Fax: 512-264-0969 PRODUCTSWEBINARS E-BRIEFINGS WHITE PAPERS SPECIAL REPORTS RESOURCESABOUT US PRIVACY POLICY LAB RESOURCES LEAD GENERATION PRESS RELEASE EmailFacebookLinkedInTwitterTHE DARK REPORT EXECUTIVE WAR COLLEGE PRECISION MEDICINE INSTITUTE SIGN IN © 2022 · The Dark Intelligence Group, Inc.

The patient was not known to have had contact with livestock or other animals, raising the possibility of human-to-human spread. Only one healthcare worker was tested for the H5N1 bird flu virus, but the results were negative. All of the healthcare workers provided blood samples to test for bird flu antibodies, but the results of those tests are not known. The CDC characterises the risk to the public at present to be low. Influenza (or flu) is a common respiratory infection caused by a group of viruses called the paramyxoviruses. These types of viruses have a genome that is made of RNA, which is vulnerable to mutation. This matters because changes in genetic material can change the characteristics of a virus, making it, say, more or less transmissible or more or less pathogenic (able to cause harm). There are four types of influenza virus: A, B, C and D. Influenza A is known to infect humans and other animals, including birds. Bird flu is type A. The different strains are denoted by receptor combinations on the viral surface called hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) and these are defined by different numbers, such as H1N1 or H2N1. One strain of bird flu, H5N1, has been circulating since 1997, when it was first noted. However, it was particularly active in the UK between October 2021 and September 2022, causing disease in both wild and domestic birds. In 2023, the H5N1 virus was detected in 37 countries with over 50 million birds culled, according to the European Food Standards agency. The virus is continuing to affect birds and has been observed in various mammals, including foxes and otters in the UK. The detection of the H5N1 virus in these mammals is not believed to be directly due to infection, but more likely due to the consumption of dead birds that had succumbed to the infection. There are no reported cases of transmission between mammals in the wild. Although, recently, there have been a handful of H5N1 cases in humans, they have been very mild cases. It should be noted that from 2003 to April 2024 there have been 463 deaths, globally. However, when compared with deaths recorded in humans annually from seasonal flu, the number of deaths caused by H5N1 in human beings is extremely small. Luckily, not adapted to mammalsThe World Health Organization reports the number of human cases of H5N1 globally (24 countries reporting) from 2003 to July 2024 came to 896 cases. What this data shows is that the virus can cause disease in humans, but is not effective at transmission between humans. For effective human-to-human transmission, genetic reassortment is needed for the virus to adapt to the human host. However, the virus is currently adapted to an avian host, not a mammalian one. However, if a human-adapted influenza virus infected a human host alongside avian H5N1 virus, the viruses potentially could swap RNA in a "reassortment event" that might allow the bird flu virus (H5N1) to become more adapted to the human host. This is similar to what happened with H1N1 (swine flu), in which the virus developed genetic properties that allowed it to infect humans. So what can be done to protect humans? For one, annual flu vaccines should be updated to provide protection against H5N1, too. There also needs to be continued monitoring of how the virus is evolving to inform potential control measures and monitor any genetic changes within the virus that might permit spread into other non-avian hosts.There is no evidence that there are genetic changes in the virus that will allow it to establish an effective presence in humans, but scientists will continue to monitor the virus. The risk of infection developing and being sustained in the human population remains low. However, vigilance is required to ensure this situation remains the same.

Here's an overview of how we're working to keep the nation informed and protected. Laboratory surveillance NHS and UKHSA laboratories across England, provide weekly data on major respiratory viruses. Using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing, we track not just influenza, but also SARS-CoV-2, rhinovirus, parainfluenza, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). This system allows us to calculate the proportion of samples positive for each virus, what is called a pseudoprevalence indicator. This metric is particularly valuable as it is less prone to fluctuations caused by changes in testing patterns than case counts. 2. Primary care surveillance The Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Weekly Returns Service, operational since 1966, now encompasses around 1,900 GP practices across England. This network provides crucial data on consultation rates for influenza-like illness (ILI), acute bronchitis, pneumonia, and COVID-19-like symptoms. To standardise reporting across the UK, we've adopted the Moving Epidemic Method (MEM), which uses historical data to evaluate the timing and intensity of influenza activity through a series of thresholds. This allows for more meaningful comparisons both within the UK and with other European countries. 3. Secondary care surveillance Our Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI-Watch) system collects data on laboratory-confirmed influenza, COVID-19, and RSV hospital admissions. Data reported reflects local testing practices within NHS trusts that participate in this surveillance. 4. Internet-based surveillance We employ several cutting-edge methods to detect early signs of outbreaks: FluSurvey: This online platform allows individuals to report symptoms weekly, providing real-time monitoring of ILI and COVID-19 symptoms in the population. Google Health Trends API: We analyse daily search query frequencies related to COVID-19 symptoms and generic coronavirus queries. FluDetector: Developed in collaboration with University College London, this tool uses natural language processing and machine learning to produce real-time ILI estimates based on internet searches. 5. Mortality surveillance We monitor excess all-cause mortality using the EuroMOMO model, allowing for comparison across European countries. Additionally, we continue to use a statistical model that was developed to monitor excess mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic. 6. Microbiological surveillance Our work extends beyond detection. We characterise flu viruses through genome sequencing and compare circulating strains to vaccine strains. We also screen for antiviral resistance and monitor antimicrobial susceptibility in key bacterial pathogens often associated with secondary infections. 7. International vigilance We maintain a global perspective, monitoring the international situation through WHO and ECDC reports, as well as other countries' national surveillance data. This includes keeping a close eye on emerging threats like avian influenza and MERS-CoV. This intricate web of surveillance systems allows UKHSA to provide nuanced, data-driven guidance to healthcare providers, policymakers, and the public. As we face another winter season, our multifaceted approach to disease surveillance is keeping the UK informed and protected. If you’re interested in diving deeper into our surveillance methods and findings, we’d encourage you to explore our weekly national flu and COVID-19 surveillance reports and the UKHSA data dashboard.

State reports 100% negative results for Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza in dairy herds Earlier this year, a nationwide outbreak of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza in cows caused panic for dairy farmers everywhere. Now, Massachusetts has become the only state to test all of its dairy herds and achieve 100% negative results for the virus. STAFF FILE PHOTO/PAUL FRANZ By MARA MELLITS For the Athol Daily News Published: 10-11-2024 5:00 PM Agriculture animals FARMING Massachusetts facebook Earlier this year, a nationwide outbreak of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza in cows caused panic for dairy farmers everywhere. Now, Massachusetts has become the only state to test all of its dairy herds, from 95 farms, and achieve 100% negative results for the virus. Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza, also known as bird or avian flu, often results in death for poultry. According to the Massachusetts Department of Agricultural Resources, cows that contract the virus exhibit lethargy and show reduced milk production for a few weeks. There have also been several cases of dairy farm workers who have contracted the virus and experienced flu-like symptoms from coming into contact with unpasteurized milk. The virus was first detected back in March in dairy cows in Texas. According to MDAR, it spread to herds in at least 14 states after that. “It’s so new this year that they’re still figuring out what the ideal host is and how it’s spreading,” said MDAR Commissioner Ashley Randle. “It’s hard to say how common it is.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the state Department of Public Health consider the public health risk to be low, but are preparing in case that changes. MDAR collaborated with DPH, the Massachusetts Association of Dairy Farmers and the Broad Institute to fight the outbreak. “We as an organization really want to make sure that we’re all in this together. And there’s a certain risk to everybody,” said Mark Duffy, who serves on the board of Massachusetts Association of Dairy Farmers and operates Great Brook Farm in Carlisle. “In the scheme of things, we are all family dairy farms in Massachusetts.” Massachusetts is the only state in the country to yield a 100% negative result, however, despite the result, testing is ongoing, Randle said. MDAR is still testing herds and will continue to test this month, at no cost to the farmers. “We must remain vigilant and continue monitoring farms across the state to protect animal and public health,” DPH Commissioner Dr. Robert Goldstein said in a statement. “This is a great example of how collaboration across government and with communities can result in better health and maintain the integrity of the local dairy industry.” Article continues after... Yesterday's Most Read Articles Your Daily Puzzles Cross|Word Flipart Typeshift SpellTower Really Bad Chess Randle said MDAR is working with the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to have a national model that states can follow. “It does take quite a bit of staff time and capacity to travel to all the herds and do testing,” Randle said. “We’re hoping that the processors will be able to assist when they’re picking up milk from the farms, to be able to take the samples as well.” Duffy said state milk inspectors come in and pull samples out of the tank where the milk is stored. “We really stress that the milk supply is safe,” Duffy said. “This is to prevent it from spreading in the dairy herd, which, if it was to occur, and it has not occurred, would have an impact on our cows.” Andrea O’Brien of O’Brien Farm in Orange said because her farm produces raw milk, she’s already used to the milk getting tested every month, so it didn’t have an impact on her farm. Yet, O’Brien said because of the size of her farm, she knows right away when something isn’t normal. “If we have a sick cow, we know right away, whereas if you’re milking 10,000, you don’t have the same sort of management,” O’Brien said. Peter Reed Laznicka and Kat Chang Laznicka operate Reed Farm in Sunderland, a small-scale poultry farm and processor. They have to take strict biosecurity measures to ensure their 10,000 chickens don’t get sick. Chang Laznicka said the two are always thinking about preventing illness. They take measures to make sure they are not cross-contaminating and keeping the area clean. “We’re just very careful. We make sure any birds that show up are healthy,” Reed Laznicka said. Randle said the virus in cattle spreads when moving in between herds. She said the size of the herds doesn’t matter but the movement of the cattle and the hygiene of the equipment is what counts. She said the virus was first detected in cows in Texas due to animals that had moved from one farm to another. “All it takes is one animal to move that has the presence of the virus, or workers that may be working on different dairy farms, or going from a poultry operation to a dairy and back again,” Randle said. Randle said because Massachusetts was the first state to yield a 100% negative result, it set a model for other states to follow. She attributed success to starting a partnership with farmers and public health officials early and keeping all lines of communication open.

This vaccine is designed for people aged 65 and older, as well as clinically at-risk individuals aged 60 to 64. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has recommended QIV-HD, and it is reimbursed by the NHS. The vaccine is now available for pre-order for the 2025/26 flu season. Dr Yassir Javaid, a General Practitioner with a Special Interest in Cardiology, highlighted the importance of this development. “Flu can be a potentially devastating multi-system disease. The elderly are at greatest risk of severe complications, associated with high rates of hospitalisation and mortality. “We are practicing in an evidence based world where, as far as possible, our treatment decisions should be based on high quality evidence and data. It is exciting to see the introduction of vaccines designed to address immunosenescence in older adults, irrespective of the season and circulating strain,” he added. The high-dose vaccine has shown increased effectiveness compared to standard-dose vaccines. Over a decade of data, including randomised studies, supports its use. Sanofi manufactures and distributes over 250 million doses of influenza vaccines globally each year. QIV-HD is the quadrivalent version of the high-dose trivalent influenza vaccine (HD-TIV). In a clinical trial with 31,989 participants aged over 65, HD-TIV was 24.2% more effective than standard-dose vaccines in preventing lab-confirmed influenza. These results have been inferred to QIV-HD through an immunobridging approach. A meta-analysis of 21 studies involving over 45 million people aged 65 and over found that high-dose influenza vaccines reduce serious complications. These include a 27.8% reduction in pneumonia hospitalisations and a 16.7% reduction in cardiorespiratory hospitalisations compared to standard-dose vaccines.

Ⓒ 2024 Dotdash Media, Inc. — All rights reserved Cold & Flu Can You Get Sick From Cold Weather? By Patty Weasler, RN, BSN Published on October 09, 2024 Medically reviewed by Jane Kim, MD Print Close Cold temperatures are associated with colds, the flu, and runny noses, but cold air does not make you sick. If you find yourself getting sicker during the cooler months, this could be because of the lack of air humidity and the increase in indoor gatherings. Johner Images / Getty Images Being Sick From the Cold: What’s True? A common misconception is that cold weather causes illness. In reality, it's germs like bacteria and viruses that cause infections. This misconception tends to be due to the rise in influenza and other communicable respiratory infections in the colder months. Research theorizes that the cooler months are related to an increase in illness for several reasons: Respiratory droplets move farther and stay longer in the air: Cold air tends to be dry and low in humidity, allowing respiratory droplets to stay longer. When air is warm and humid, the moisture from the air causes the droplets to fall to the ground faster. Dryness weakens the body's ability to defend against germs: Dry air during cold months decreases moisture on the skin and inside the nose and mouth. When the inside of the nose is dry, it limits the body's ability to defend itself against intruding germs. Indoor gatherings increase contact with germs: People tend to gather inside to stay warm as the weather gets colder. Closer contact with more people inside increases contact with potentially infectious respiratory droplets from others. Lower vitamin D: Vitamin D is involved with immunity and is produced by UV radiation. Researchers theorize that during the colder months, when UV radiation is lower and vitamin D production is down, this could increase influenza epidemics. Exacerbated Conditions and Symptoms Most people will recover from viral illnesses on their own within two weeks. However, people with chronic conditions or who are immunocompromised may develop serious symptoms. Viral infections like influenza can cause serious complications like pneumonia from the influenza virus or an opportunistic infection from bacteria. Other serious symptoms and infections caused by viral illnesses include: Myocarditis Encephalitis Myositis Sepsis Viral infections can also make chronic conditions like asthma, diabetes, and chronic heart disease worse. People who are 65 years and older, pregnant, or young children are also at risk for serious complications. How to Boost Immunity and Stay Warm There is no one way to boost immunity, but there are several ways to help support the immune system and potentially prevent illness when it is cold outside. One of the best ways to prevent certain illnesses is to get vaccines when available. The flu vaccine and pneumonia vaccine can help prevent infection and complications related to the condition. Other ways to boost immunity include: Avoid smokingExercise regularlyLessen stressEat a healthy dietMaintain a healthy weight Though many stores sell immune-boosting supplements and powders, research has not found that these supplements provide enough of an immune boost to prevent infection or disease. If someone feels that they are not getting enough nutrients in their diet, then a multivitamin or mineral supplement can provide benefits. Benefits of Fresh Air Going outside and getting some fresh air can have health benefits. Going outside will help increase vitamin D levels with exposure to UV light, and the outdoors can improve mood and make people happier. Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) increases during colder winter months, and a little outdoor time can help manage it. A Word From Verywell Although we can't prevent every cold or respiratory illness, we do have tools to prevent some of the most significant ones. Vaccinations are available for influenza, COVID, pneumococcal pneumonia, and RSV. Talk with your doctor to see which ones would be appropriate for you. — JANE KIM, MD, MEDICAL EXPERT BOARD Summary When cold weather arrives, it brings along runny noses, colds, and the flu. But these illnesses are not caused by the cold. They are caused by an increase in gathering indoors and lower humidity. Make sure to wash your hands, cover your mouth when coughing and sneezing, and get the flu vaccine where available. 5 Sources Verywell Health uses only high-quality sources, including peer-reviewed studies, to support the facts within our articles.

(AP Photo/Rodrigo Abd, File) National News University of Georgia partnering with FDA to test U.S. dairy for avian influenza by: Eric Dorsch Posted: Oct 8, 2024 / 09:59 AM EDT Updated: Oct 8, 2024 / 09:59 AM EDT (AP Photo/Rodrigo Abd, File) by: Eric Dorsch Posted: Oct 8, 2024 / 09:59 AM EDT Updated: Oct 8, 2024 / 09:59 AM EDT SHARE ATHENS, Ga. (WSAV) – The University of Georgia (UGA) has announced that it will be partnering with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to test U.S. dairy supplies for avian influenza. Testing is being done to help reduce the threat of avian influenza due to the recent Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza A (H5N1) outbreak. The UGA Center for Influenza Disease and Emergence Research will lead the university’s efforts. UGA is one of five institutions nationwide that are currently helping to ensure the safety of dairy products. “This virus and its spread are concerning,” said S. Mark Tompkins, director and principal investigator of the UGA center. “I worry about the changing ecology of this virus, the sustained spread of H5N1 across dairy farms, and our ability to take the steps to address it.” H5N1, more commonly known as “Bird Flu”, is found in wild aquatic birds across the globe and can cause outbreaks and disease in poultry. In recent years, the virus has evolved to infect more than 100 species. While extremely rare, avian influenza can spread from person to person. H5N1 was detected in U.S. dairy cattle for the first time this year, prompting concerns about the safety of the country’s dairy supply. The virus has been detected in raw milk from infected cows but at this time pasteurization appears to kill H5N1. So it is unlikely to infect people through consumption though raw dairy products are another story. “The concern is that there is a substantial population that prefers unpasteurized dairy products,” said Tompkins, who also serves as a professor of virology and immunology in UGA’s College of Veterinary Medicine. “The risk of falling ill from salmonella or listeria contamination of raw dairy products has been recognized for many years. “Now, with the possibility of contamination of the milk supply with H5N1 influenza virus, we have the potential of people becoming infected through consumption of unpasteurized milk, cheese or other dairy products. Those infections provide an opportunity for the virus to gain a foothold and spread in humans.” Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

This seasonal movement of birds can exacerbate outbreaks, impacting both wild and domestic bird populations globally. PDF FILE As autumn approaches, the migration of wild birds poses a significant threat to the spread of avian influenza, particularly the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus. This seasonal movement of birds can exacerbate outbreaks, impacting both wild and domestic bird populations globally. The role of migration in Avian Influenza spread Wild birds, especially waterfowl, are natural reservoirs for avian influenza viruses. During migration, these birds travel long distances, often crossing continents, and can carry the virus to new regions. The HPAI virus, particularly the H5N1 strain, has been a major concern due to its high mortality rate in birds and potential to infect humans. In recent years, the spread of H5N1 has been documented across various continents. For instance, the virus has been detected in multiple bird species in Antarctica, including brown skuas and black-browed albatrosses. This intercontinental spread highlights the role of migratory birds in transporting the virus over vast distances. Impact on poultry industry The poultry industry is particularly vulnerable to avian influenza outbreaks. In the United States, the autumn migration coincides with increased risks of infection in poultry farms. The 2022-2024 outbreaks led to the culling of over 100 million chickens and turkeys, causing significant economic losses. Farmers are advocating for the use of vaccines to protect their flocks, although there are challenges related to vaccine deployment and international trade restrictions. Preventative measuresContinue after advertising. Countries are ramping up their biosecurity measures to mitigate the risk of avian influenza during migration periods. For example, France has increased its vaccine program, purchasing millions of doses to protect poultry. Additionally, farms are implementing strict biosecurity protocols, such as keeping poultry indoors during migration seasons and enhancing sanitation practices. Climate change and Avian Influenza Climate change is also influencing the spread of avian influenza. Warmer winters and earlier springs can alter migration patterns and extend the survival of the virus in the environment. This can lead to more frequent and severe outbreaks, as seen in recent years. In North America, warmer winters and the earlier onset of spring that global warming is causing could allow some moisture-dependent pathogens to survive and spread more easily. Meanwhile, colder and wetter conditions may increase the survival of influenza viruses in bird droppings and contaminated water. Conclusion The autumn migration of wild birds significantly increases the risk of avian influenza outbreaks. The global spread of the H5N1 virus underscores the need for robust surveillance and biosecurity measures. As climate change continues to impact migration patterns, the threat of avian influenza is likely to persist, necessitating ongoing efforts to protect both wild and domestic bird populations.

The 2009 H1N1 or ‘swine flu’ pandemic emerged as a result of a triple reassortment between avian, swine, and human influenza viruses, which led to a new variant which was able to spread rapidly, contributing to the deaths of an estimated quarter of a million people and infecting between 11 and 21 per cent of the global population. The conditions for a reassortment event may be even better today, scientists argue.Reassortment through coinfectionEarly evidence suggests the effectiveness of the 2024 seasonal flu vaccine might be as low as 35 per cent, studies by the US Centre for Disease Control (CDC) of the recent flu season in the Southern Hemisphere have shown. Coupled with a low uptake of the vaccine, which would leave more people at risk of catching the flu, these factors raise the risk of reassortment taking place, said Connor Browne, a biorisk consultant. “The combination of a lower-than-expected efficacy for this year’s flu vaccine and the likelihood that uptake of the vaccine could well be lower than in previous years increases the chances of a H5N1 reassortment event occurring through coinfection,” he said on Twitter.At least 19 people have been infected with H5N1 in the US this year – almost all of them poultry or dairy workers who had direct contact with sick animals.But one case – a patient in Missouri – had no known contact with animals at all.At least seven people who had contact with that patient came down with flu-like symptoms at a similar time, raising concerns the virus could be already spreading between people.The CDC are investigating the potential cluster, but have not said whether or not they were infected with H5N1.Experts have long considered avian influenza a top global health threat and have urged governments worldwide to fortify their pandemic preparedness plans in case the virus begins to spread between humans, something the World Health Organization has repeatedly stressed would be of “enormous concern”.Dr Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organisation, told a press conference on Thursday that the US needs to focus on “access to testing, getting vaccines to people with high-risk occupational exposure, and answer some of the basic science questions – like how the virus is being transmitted between cows”.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Join the conversation Show comments The Telegraph values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

(Numstocker/Shutterstock)Social SharingA team of Canadian and American researchers says their method of forecasting the rate of transmission of infectious diseases is predicting an earlier spike in influenza cases this year.Using mathematics and machine learning, the researchers analyzed data from late 2015 to September 2024, incorporating weather conditions, policy choices and movement patterns (drawn from cell phones) to predict how diseases like influenza and COVID-19 might spread. The team expects there will be more than 1,600 new flu cases confirmed each day in U.S. laboratories by the end of November, nearly double the number of cases during the same time period last year."For the prediction in this report, we applied U.S. data, but I think we would state that if we used Canadian data, similar conclusions would be drawn," said Hao Wang, director of the Interdisciplinary Lab for Mathematical Ecology and Epidemiology at the University of Alberta. Wang, who is also a full professor and Tier 1 Canada Research Chair in mathematical biosciences, said the team has predicted the initial surge of flu cases this year will come a month earlier than it did last year. He said he hopes this information informs public health officials."We hope we can make some impact on the decision making," he said. Bookings open for COVID-19, flu and RSV shots for AlbertansAlberta to cover pricey RSV vaccine for some older peopleWang said he and his colleagues have published multiple papers about their novel forecasting approach. Last year, he and Xiunan Wang, an assistant professor in the department of mathematics at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, published a paper about it in the peer-reviewed SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics.Junling Ma, a full professor in the department of mathematics and statistics at the University of Victoria, who was not involved in the U of A team's research, said he has not examined influenza patterns in recent years but is familiar with the model and thinks it is suitable for capturing the key features of influenza."I think if it happens, their model should be able to capture the feature that it goes up faster and earlier this year, so I would trust their result at this stage" he said.University of Alberta professor Hao Wang predicts Canada and the U.S. will see an earlier surge in flu cases this year. (Submitted by Hao Wang)He said public health officials could prepare for an earlier flu surge by ensuring enough hospital beds are available and encouraging people to get flu shots sooner.According to the federal government, influenza is among the top 10 leading causes of death in Canada and it causes thousands of hospitalizations every year. Last year, less than a quarter of Albertans received the flu shot and the province saw its deadliest flu season in 15 years.The provincial government announced Monday that flu shot appointments will be available starting October 15.Health Minister Adriana LaGrange said during a news conference that the government is anticipating a flu season very similar to last year."There's procedures in place, policy in place to ensure that we have the capacity that we need," she said.André Gagnon, a spokesperson for the Public Health Agency of Canada, said in a statement that it's difficult to predict how influenza will behave, but flu season tends to begin in mid-November, peak in late December to February and end by late May.Gagnon said the public health agency does not use artificial intelligence in its forecasting to predict transmission rates."There is currently no indication that influenza cases are increasing earlier than we would expect, but PHAC will continue to monitor and report weekly," he said.Ghada Haggag, a pharmacist who owns and manages All Care Pharmacy in Edmonton's Capilano neighbourhood, said there has been strong demand for flu and COVID-19 shots this year — far more than in 2023.She said last year people may have been experiencing vaccine fatigue, but many seniors in the area have made two immunization appointments this fall — one for COVID-19 and the flu and the other for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).RSV vaccines are given two weeks before or after COVID-19 and flu immunization vaccines.ABOUT THE AUTHORMadeleine CummingsReporterMadeleine Cummings is a reporter with CBC Edmonton.

(Photo by Jared Strong/Iowa Capital Dispatch) A group of Midwest egg suppliers are embroiled in litigation over egg prices, with an Iowa company arguing it shouldn’t be forced to disclose its pricing information. A central element of the case is whether a fabricated claim of a bird flu outbreak is to blame for one supplier raising its egg prices and canceling orders. Grand Prairie Foods of South Dakota, which supplies hotels and convenience stores with breakfast sandwiches, is suing Echo Lake Foods, a Wisconsin company that manufactures precooked egg entrees, for breach of contract and unjust enrichment. At the same time, a third company, Oskaloosa Food Products in Iowa, is attempting to quash a subpoena for company records related to its pricing. Court records indicate Grand Prairie has purchased egg patties and other products from Echo Lake since at least 2005. In early 2022, Echo Lake’s supplier of raw eggs experienced an outbreak of avian influenza, commonly known as the bird flu, resulting in the destruction of more than 6 million laying hens. GET THE MORNING HEADLINES. SUBSCRIBE Echo Lake then notified its customers, including Grand Prairie, that existing purchase orders for egg patties and other egg products would have to be revised to reflect increased pricing. According to Grand Prairie’s lawsuit, Echo Lake Foods then doubled the price of its egg patties, and while the nationwide market price of eggs eventually decreased, Echo Lake allegedly refused to reduce the price of its egg patties. Court exhibits show that on July 12, 2022, Grand Prairie’s president, Kurt Loudenback, e-mailed Echo Lake’s director of national sales, Justin Milbradt, writing, “Justin – I don’t understand why we continue to see these high prices,” noting that Grand Prairie could purchase eggs from other suppliers at a significantly lower price. “I’m sure you buy WAY more eggs than we do,” Loudenback added. The next day, Loudenback emailed Echo Lake again, proposing that his company sell tankers of whole eggs to Echo Lake for $1.28 per pound – significantly less than the $3.60 per pound Echo Lake was charging Grand Prairie for its finished egg products. “Just trying to get your eggs at (a) lower price to lower my cost,” Loudenback explained in his email. “$3.60 seems pretty high for a $1.28 input cost.” The two companies eventually agreed on an arrangement whereby Grand Prairie would sell two truckloads of raw eggs each week to Echo Lake. Court records show Echo Lake agreed to pay a “premium price,” $1.70 per pound, for the raw eggs from Grand Prairie. In return, the records show, Echo Lake would sell the finished, processed eggs back to Grand Prairie for $3.60 per pound — the same price Grand Prairie had previously objected to as being out of line with market prices. Within a few months, however, Grand Prairie told Echo Lake that an avian flu outbreak had affected its egg supplier, Oskaloosa Food Products, and so Grand Prairie would have to raise its prices. A few weeks later, Grand Prairie said it was unable to find a new supplier and wouldn’t be able to fulfill Echo Lake’s orders. Echo Lake then began acquiring eggs elsewhere – but at a higher price. In court documents, Echo Lake says Grand Prairie’s failure to deliver eggs at the promised price cost Echo Lake more than $1.1 million. Court exhibits show that in an effort to offset the added expense, Echo Lake withheld payments to Grand Prairie totaling $567,460. Grand Prairie then sued Echo Lake to recover the $567,460 it was owed, alleging breach of contract and unjust enrichment. Echo Lake countersued, claiming Grand Prairie had breached the contract. Was company’s bird-flu claim false? Recently filed court records show that attorneys for Echo Lake are questioning Grand Prairie’s stated rationale for its price hike and the eventual cancellation of orders – an avian flu outbreak that affected the Oskaloosa plant. In July, an Echo Lake attorney wrote to a lawyer for Oskaloosa Food Products, stating that while “Grand Prairie claims it had no choice other than to cancel the remaining purchase orders because of an outbreak of avian influenza among its suppliers, including Oskaloosa,” an independent investigation had concluded Oskaloosa reported no such outbreak at that time, despite legal requirements for such reporting. In addition, the lawyer wrote, the chief operating officer of the Oskaloosa plant had confirmed for Echo Lake that “Oskaloosa did not experience the Al outbreak described by Grand Prairie.” In late May, Echo Lake subpoenaed Oskaloosa Food Products to obtain access to the contract between Grand Prairie and the Oskaloosa company. Oskaloosa has since filed a motion to quash that subpoena, arguing the agreement includes trade secrets. Echo Lake has responded in court by arguing that the price of eggs is not a trade secret. That issue is now before a judge in the U.S. District Court for Southern Iowa, while the underlying lawsuit between Grand Prairie and Echo Lake continues to move forward in South Dakota federal court.

SUPPORT XEgg suppliers battle over pricing, claims of bird flu outbreak by Clark Kauffman, Iowa Capital Dispatch October 11, 2024 Egg suppliers battle over pricing, claims of bird flu outbreak by Clark Kauffman, Iowa Capital Dispatch October 11, 2024 A group of Midwest egg suppliers are embroiled in litigation over egg prices, with an Iowa company arguing it shouldn’t be forced to disclose its pricing information. A central element of the case is whether a fabricated claim of a bird flu outbreak is to blame for one supplier raising its egg prices and canceling orders. Grand Prairie Foods of South Dakota, which supplies hotels and convenience stores with breakfast sandwiches, is suing Echo Lake Foods, a Wisconsin company that manufactures precooked egg entrees, for breach of contract and unjust enrichment. At the same time, a third company, Oskaloosa Food Products in Iowa, is attempting to quash a subpoena for company records related to its pricing. Court records indicate Grand Prairie has purchased egg patties and other products from Echo Lake since at least 2005. In early 2022, Echo Lake’s supplier of raw eggs experienced an outbreak of avian influenza, commonly known as the bird flu, resulting in the destruction of more than 6 million laying hens. GET THE MORNING HEADLINES. SUBSCRIBE Echo Lake then notified its customers, including Grand Prairie, that existing purchase orders for egg patties and other egg products would have to be revised to reflect increased pricing. According to Grand Prairie’s lawsuit, Echo Lake Foods then doubled the price of its egg patties, and while the nationwide market price of eggs eventually decreased, Echo Lake allegedly refused to reduce the price of its egg patties. Court exhibits show that on July 12, 2022, Grand Prairie’s president, Kurt Loudenback, e-mailed Echo Lake’s director of national sales, Justin Milbradt, writing, “Justin – I don’t understand why we continue to see these high prices,” noting that Grand Prairie could purchase eggs from other suppliers at a significantly lower price. “I’m sure you buy WAY more eggs than we do,” Loudenback added. The next day, Loudenback emailed Echo Lake again, proposing that his company sell tankers of whole eggs to Echo Lake for $1.28 per pound – significantly less than the $3.60 per pound Echo Lake was charging Grand Prairie for its finished egg products. “Just trying to get your eggs at (a) lower price to lower my cost,” Loudenback explained in his email. “$3.60 seems pretty high for a $1.28 input cost.” The two companies eventually agreed on an arrangement whereby Grand Prairie would sell two truckloads of raw eggs each week to Echo Lake. Court records show Echo Lake agreed to pay a “premium price,” $1.70 per pound, for the raw eggs from Grand Prairie. In return, the records show, Echo Lake would sell the finished, processed eggs back to Grand Prairie for $3.60 per pound — the same price Grand Prairie had previously objected to as being out of line with market prices. Within a few months, however, Grand Prairie told Echo Lake that an avian flu outbreak had affected its egg supplier, Oskaloosa Food Products, and so Grand Prairie would have to raise its prices. A few weeks later, Grand Prairie said it was unable to find a new supplier and wouldn’t be able to fulfill Echo Lake’s orders. Echo Lake then began acquiring eggs elsewhere – but at a higher price. In court documents, Echo Lake says Grand Prairie’s failure to deliver eggs at the promised price cost Echo Lake more than $1.1 million. Court exhibits show that in an effort to offset the added expense, Echo Lake withheld payments to Grand Prairie totaling $567,460. Grand Prairie then sued Echo Lake to recover the $567,460 it was owed, alleging breach of contract and unjust enrichment. Echo Lake countersued, claiming Grand Prairie had breached the contract.

By Dr Jeremy Quah As we celebrate World Heart Day (29 September) and the International Day of Older Persons (1 October) recently, I would like to highlight the importance of preventing influenza, particularly among older adults and those with heart disease. These groups face heightened risks, especially since influenza can trigger severe complications, including heart attacks. Moreover, there is significant overlap amongst these high-risk groups. Influenza can trigger individual first heart attack For instance, influenza can trigger an individual’s first heart attack – amongst adults over 40 years old, published data recorded a 10x increase in first heart attack rates among patients who had contracted influenza. Meanwhile, many of my older patients are accompanied by their adult children, who have a sincere desire to keep their parents safe from harm, especially those who are frail and in poor health. This often involves asking them to limit their activities to prevent illness or injury. Despite their best intentions however, staying safe should not come at the expense of living a full life. In your golden years, being surrounded by loved ones and engaging in activities that bring you joy—whether it’s line dancing, traveling, or celebrating special moments with friends—truly enriches your life. After decades of hard work and raising a family, embracing this vibrant phase as a retiree, mentor, parent, grandparent, and cherished friend is what quality of life is all about. I deeply believe in the importance of older adults staying active and enjoying a fulfilling life, free from the burdens of illness. One vital yet often overlooked aspect of health protection is the annual influenza vaccination. This vaccine is not just a precaution; it’s a key safeguard against the many risks and complications that can arise from influenza, helping to ensure you can continue to embrace life’s joyful moments. Precious protection: Why it’s needed As we age, our immune systems naturally weaken, making us more susceptible to infectious diseases like influenza. This risk is further compounded for many with chronic conditions, such as heart disease, which can significantly amplify the impact of an infection. Research indicates that a staggering 90% of influenza-related deaths occur in individuals aged 65 and older. The risk of dying from influenza is five times greater for those with heart disease and 20 times higher for individuals with both heart and pulmonary conditions. Even for those who recover, the consequences can be severe, often leading to loss of function or disability. In simple terms, the combination of aging, chronic health issues and influenza places older adults at a higher risk of serious illness, complications, and extended hospital stays. This is particularly evident among heart patients, where influenza has been acknowledged as a standalone risk factor for increased mortality, poor clinical outcomes, and longer hospital stays for those hospitalized with heart failure due to infection. It has also been noted that more major cardiovascular events occur following influenza outbreaks. Thankfully, there is also a comprehensive body of research that highlights the protective benefits of influenza vaccines, which could help to reduce the risk of death by 48% among older persons. A recent study also found a 41% reduction in CV mortality among those who received the influenza vaccination within 72 hours of a coronary procedure or hospitalisation. As we approach the season of year-end travels and festive gatherings, let us be mindful that the influenza virus is easily passed from person to person, especially among the same household and in crowded conditions, which increase potential exposure and spread of the virus. With Malaysia now officially an ageing nation with 2.5 million (7.4%) individuals aged 65 and older, we urgently need greater awareness on the elevated risk faced by older persons, so that we can make influenza vaccinations a priority for this vulnerable group. In closing, I sincerely encourage all older adults to value your health and recognize its importance. A single influenza infection can have serious, irreversible consequences. Please prioritize your well-being by getting your influenza vaccine—it’s a vital step to help you stay healthy and fully enjoy all the wonderful moments life has to offer. -- BERNAMA Dr Jeremy Quah is a Consultant Cardiologist with National Heart Institute (IJN) (The views expressed in this article are those of the author(s) and do not reflect the official policy or position of BERNAMA) Keywords influenzaolder adults heart diseaseprotectionprecaution Related Article Recommended AGE BY CHOICE: UNLOCKING ACTIVE AGEING BEYOND CHRONOLOGICAL YEARS YOUR DENTIST, YOUR FRIEND WHY AND HOW BLOCKCHAIN CAN SHAKE UP THE ACADEMIC LANDSCAPE Copyright © 2024 BERNAMA ThoughtsExpert Systems Celebrates Milestone in Clinical Development of Tivoxavir Marboxil, Potential One-Time Influenza Treatment | TRAW Stock News STOCK TITAN Login Sign up Login Please enter your login and password Wrong username or password.

Search jobs 10-Oct-2024 Pediatric Influenza Treatment Market to Reach USD 847.7 Million by 2032, Growing at a CAGR of 3.5% Global Pediatric Influenza Treatment Market The global pediatric influenza treatment market is set to experience steady growth over the next decade, with market size expected to rise from USD 578.2 million in 2022 to USD 847.7 million by 2032. This expansion represents a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.5% during the forecast period from 2022 to 2032, according to the latest industry forecasts. The increasing incidence of pediatric influenza, alongside heightened awareness about the importance of timely treatment, is driving the demand for pediatric influenza treatments. Influenza, commonly known as the flu, poses a significant risk to children, particularly those under the age of five, and can lead to severe complications if left untreated. Key Factors Driving Market Growth: Rising Influenza Cases Among Children: The growing prevalence of influenza among children, particularly in developing and densely populated regions, is boosting demand for effective treatment options. Increased Awareness: Parents and healthcare providers are becoming more aware of the potential dangers of pediatric influenza, leading to a higher demand for antiviral medications and vaccines. Advances in Influenza Vaccines: Ongoing advancements in influenza vaccine development are improving the efficacy of treatments, contributing to market growth. Industry Outlook: The pediatric influenza treatment market is expected to benefit from increased healthcare spending and government initiatives aimed at controlling influenza outbreaks. Collaboration between pharmaceutical companies, healthcare providers, and governments will play a crucial role in enhancing access to pediatric influenza treatments worldwide. Influenza is also known as the flu. It is a sickness caused by a respiratory infection. The disease can spread quickly through groups as the infection is passed from individual to individual, especially children. Mainly caused by influenza A or influenza B virus, which happens in outbreaks worldwide consistently, primarily during the winter seasons in calm atmospheres. The disease goes ahead quick and is more exceptional than a cold. Children tend to feel more uncomfortable during the initial 2 or 3 days they’re affected. Symptoms include high-grade fever up to 104 degrees F, chills and shakes during fever, extreme tiredness, headache and body aches, dry, hacking cough, vomiting and belly pain, and other symptoms. Flu causes an obvious infection trouble (e.g. school and expanded recurrence of outpatient therapeutic visits), and youngsters are critical vectors for the spread of ailment. Immunization is an essential general well-being measure for the anticipation of flu disease. However, professionally prescribed medications or antiviral medications additionally might be utilized for counteractive action in high-hazard patients who have not been inoculated or who may have an imperfect reaction to the immunization and can be utilized to treat flu or to prevent the flu in the pediatric influenza treatment market. Treatment with antiviral therapeutic drugs may lessen additional serious influenza-related complications like pneumonia and hospitalizations. People can opt for approved antiviral medicines such as oseltamivir (Tamiflu) or zanamivir (Relenza). Other treatments proposed by healthcare professionals include plenty of rest, plenty of fluids, and usage of acetaminophen or ibuprofen to lower fever and ease aches. Global Paediatric Influenza Treatment Industry: Drivers and Restraints Antiviral prescriptions are viable for the counteractive action of flu, and, when utilized for treatment, can diminish the span and seriousness of the disease. Early antiviral treatment can decrease the danger of serious illness or death identified with flu. In any case, the development of imperviousness to at least one of the four authorized antiviral specialists (oseltamivir, zanamivir, amantadine, and rimantadine) among some flowing flu infection strains during the previous 5 years has confounded antiviral treatment and chemoprophylaxis suggestions. Expanding indications of flu between the age group of 1 to 9 years coupled with a rise in the usage of antiviral drugs have added a major contribution to the overall growth of the market. Also rising approvals for medications such as Mainly three influenza antiviral medicines approved by the U.S. (FDA) are prescribed for use in the U.S. during the 2016-2017 flu season: oral oseltamivir (accessible as a generic drug or under the exchange name Tamiflu), zanamivir ( Relenza – trade name) and intravenous peramivir (trade name Rapivab). These medications are artificially related antiviral drugs known as neuraminidase inhibitors that have action against both influenza A and B infections. Late innovative headways in restorative antiviral drugs for treating different types of this sickness have additionally caused an expanded request worldwide, which will keep on contributing towards the development of pediatric influenza treatment during the forecast period. However, there are factors such as a limited number of treatment options in developing economies coupled with the high very high cost of branded drugs, expensiveness, and inefficient usage of low-cost non-prescribed drugs, less availability of antiviral drugs with improper guidelines in various regions, and monopoly of few players, which have impeded the growth of the market. Pediatric Influenza Treatment Industry: Region-Wise Outlook North America region is expected to witness faster revenue growth in comparison with markets in other regions. The reasons for the same are higher infection rates amongst children, higher cost of antiviral drugs, and a large population of patients of young age (1-9 years) suffering from pediatric influenza. Higher awareness levels among physicians and frequent publication of results of upcoming treatments tend to create a positive sentiment in the region, which is absent in other regions such as the Middle East Africa, and Asia. Considerable research efforts toward the development of novel vaccines/drugs and innovative medication regimens are factors expected to aid the revenue growth of the market over the forecast years.

LUIS ROBAYO/AFP/Getty Images Plus Share this:EmailFacebookTwitterPinterestRedditGoogle ClassroomPrint By Tina Hesman Saey, Erin Garcia de Jesús and Janet Raloff October 10, 2024 at 6:30 am News reports of bird flu striking huge flocks of birds — including farmed poultry — have been ongoing for more than two years. Still, “most people have no idea that we are in the middle of a wildlife emergency — an animal pandemic,” says Michelle Wille. A viral ecologist, she works at the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity in Melbourne, Australia.

Classroom Questions Power Words Readability Score: 6.8 Read another version of this article at Science News She’s been studying bird flu. And the current panzootic — the animal equivalent to a human pandemic — is “very concerning,” she says. This new variant of bird flu is what’s called highly pathogenic avian influenza, or HPAI. That means this virus is especially deadly to birds. Water birds, such as ducks, naturally carry avian flu with little or no or sign of sickness. But when flu viruses shuffle between farmed poultry and waterfowl, viral variants can emerge and spread. These may now make the virus super lethal to birds. Explainer: Virus variants and strains That appears to be what’s behind the new flu variants spreading around the globe. And birds are not the only victims. Indeed, since the current outbreak emerged in Europe three years ago, bird flu has shown up in at least 50 mammal species around the globe. That’s far more than the dozen or so kinds of mammals that bird flu is known to have sickened during previous outbreaks. Infected mammals A variety of mammals across the United States have tested positive for avian flu. Each symbol represents counties that have reported cases. State colors indicate the routes birds take, called flyways, as they migrate south for the winter or north for the summer. Detection of the new H5N1 bird flu variant in U.S. mammals, 2022–2023 Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service/USDAAnimal and Plant Health Inspection Service/USDA Infections are hitting some animals so badly and in such large numbers, Wille says, “that this may be the nail in the coffin for some species.” By that, she means they could die out. Influenza viruses come in many types. These are designated by numbers. This one is H5N1. Each numbered virus can evolve into a range of variants, too. Variants can differ greatly in how they spread, which animals they’ll sicken, how sick they’ll make their victims and more. When a variant behaves in a very new way, scientists refer to it as a new strain. And although H5N1 has grabbed headlines throughout 2024, the current variant actually emerged in Europe four years ago. It didn’t really become a big global threat until late 2021. Since then, though, it’s thought to have killed millions of wild birds. In Peru alone, more than 100,000 wild birds have died. Russia and Canada have documented tens of thousands more bird deaths. In the United States, roughly 10,000 wild birds have tested positive for avian flu. And in October 2023, H5N1 arrived in the Antarctic region for the first time. It killed a type of seabird — skuas — in the Falkland Islands there, as well as albatrosses and gentoo penguins. A deadly version of avian influenza is behind an outbreak in wild birds, including pelicans in Lima, Peru (shown), and domestic poultry. The virus has also been detected in mammals, although there is no evidence of widespread transmission in animals other than birds.ERNESTO BENAVIDES/AFP via Getty Images Beyond birds, a polar bear on the North Slope of Alaska, way above the Arctic Circle, died from this flu late in 2023. Last December, the state’s veterinarian confirmed it had H5N1. That same month, news came of a devastating die-off of southern elephant seal pups in Argentina. Researchers had collected data on three beaches where the seals haul out to calve. Most of the babies died from bird flu. Indeed, by the end of November 2023, only five in every 100 pups were still alive. If this same rate of losses from H5N1 happened throughout the regional population last year, the researchers noted, “it is estimated that more than 17,400 [pups] may have died in this epidemic.” Since then, H5N1 infections have been hitting poultry farms, dairy cattle — and the occasional farmer. And then there’s felines. Cats big and small have sometimes died. For instance, the virus has killed at least 22 mountain lions. It also sickened at least 10 bobcats, killing at least seven of them. Other big cats to die of this virus: a captive leopard in New York and a captive tiger in Nebraska. Here, we answer some questions about how worried we should be as this virus continues to wend its way through animals around the globe. Cats are well-known predators of birds. But catching a wild bird may expose kitty to H5N1 bird flu, which can be deadly to them.Mariia Siurtukova/moment/getty images plus If cows are infected, can we get bird flu from drinking the milk or eating cheese? Traces of bird flu virus have been showing up in milk on U.S. grocery shelves. That’s led many people to wonder: Can drinking that milk make me sick? And the short answer is no. Here’s why. This past spring, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) sampled grocery store milk in regions where infected cows had turned up. And FDA did find H5N1 viral fragments in about 1 in every 5 samples of the milk it tested. Those fragments were viral RNA. That doesn’t mean the whole virus was present, notes Michael Osterholm. He directs the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. It’s in Minneapolis. Raw milk — meaning it is unpasteurized — could host the virus. But grocery store milk has been heat-treated to a temperature that will kill bacteria and viruses. So it’s not surprising to find genetic remains of the flu virus in this milk, Osterholm says. This also means, he says, “we don’t have to be concerned about ‘Are we ingesting infective material?’” Dairy farms in at least 13 states have reported cases of bird flu in cattle, and four people exposed to an infected cow have developed symptoms (usually mild, such as pinkeye or a cough). The risk to people remains low, but cow-to-cow spread appears likely, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association.Dusty Pixel photography/Getty Images What’s more, H5N1 is an “enveloped” virus. This type wraps itself in a blanket borrowed from the membrane of a cell from its host animal. These viruses are “just a little bit wimpier than non-enveloped viruses,” says Meghan Davis. And that makes them “a little bit easier to inactivate.” It also means “there’s some reassurance that pasteurization ought to be working,” she says. Davis is an environmental epidemiologist, or disease detective. She works at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, Md. All this explains why experts warn that people should not drink unpasteurized (raw) milk. It might still have infectious bird flu virus in it.

There was a problem signing you up. If chickens are getting infected, is it safe to eat their meat — or that of turkeys and ducks? And what about eggs? People will not get bird flu by eating properly prepared poultry, according to the FDA. The first step: Always cook both the eggs and the meat of these birds to temperatures that will kill off germs. Next, make sure to wash hands with warm water and soap for at least 20 seconds before and after touching eggs or raw poultry. Similarly, counters, knives and cutting boards — or any kitchen equipment that touches eggs and raw meat — should be washed thoroughly with soap and water. To curb the U.S. spread of the H5N1 bird flu in 2024, farmers killed millions of their chickens. But scientists worry that this culling could slow the development of vaccines against the virus. Why? Because chicken eggs are used to grow the virus used to make most flu vaccines today. Keep in mind, most birds harbor some germs. So these safe-handling rules will help keep other commonly found germs, too, from sickening cooks and diners. Those germs include Salmonella, E. coli and Campylobacter. Also, because flu-sickened birds show symptoms swiftly, “the chance of infected poultry or eggs entering the food [supply] is extremely low,” according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). Farmers will see their animals are sick and cull them. But it’s not just up to farmers. USDA also tests flocks for signs of infection. It sends inspectors to farms and to shops where birds are slaughtered to make sure all recommended steps to limit the risk of infection are being taken. For years, researchers and farmers around the world have been monitoring for bird flu on farms. They’re trying to scout early threats to their livestock. Here, Kooiker Teun de Vaal of the Netherlands uses a cotton swab to test one of his ducks on January 12, 2022.SANDER KONING/ANP/AFP via Getty Images Is there a vaccine for this virus like there is for the COVID virus? Over the past few years, three companies have developed vaccines for use against the H5N1 virus. All three received FDA approval to limit or prevent disease. So far this type of flu hasn’t posed a huge risk to people. But if things change, these human vaccines can be rolled out for widespread release. Explainer: What is a vaccine? One concern: Scientists note it could be hard to make a lot of vaccine quickly. The virus used in making a vaccine is usually grown in chicken eggs. But when bird flu is especially widespread, farmers may kill off many chickens that are sick or have been exposed to this virus. That can limit the availability of eggs for vaccine production. Some companies are working to develop vaccines that could be made more quickly. These shots use the same technology that the COVID-19 vaccine does. But they are far from being ready to use in people. Scientists are testing vaccines to curb H5N1 transmission in people. For now, few people other than workers on farms with infected livestock appear to face much of a risk of infection. If I get bird flu, how sick will it make me? In general, H5N1 is very deadly to birds, such as chickens. But so far, it’s sickened few people. Right now, people working with animals that might be infected are at highest risk. Four farmers with infected dairy cows got sick. So did nine workers who had contact with infected chickens or turkeys. One person in Missouri got H5N1 despite having no contact with cows or poultry. Someone that person lives with also got sick. So did two health care workers who had contact with that first Missouri person. These others hadn’t been formally tested for bird flu. As of late September, they were due to get tests for antibodies that should show whether they, too, had bird flu. Do you have a science question? We can help! Submit your question here, and we might answer it an upcoming issue of Science News Explores Starting in March 2024, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, set up a national program to watch for signs of human risk from the H5N1 virus. As of mid-September, it had monitored more than 4,800 people. It tested more than 240 who had been exposed to infected animals. Of those, it found only 14 cases in people. Worldwide, only 29 human cases have turned up across nine countries. Seven people have died. By comparison, seasonal flu kills an estimated 300,000 people or more each year. Some bird flu infections are mild. You might have no symptoms. But if you do get sick, you might have a cough, sore throat, pinkeye (conjunctivitis), a runny or stuffy nose, headaches or body aches. You might find yourself short of breath. Some people develop a fever and get very tired. More severe cases may cause diarrhea, vomiting, pneumonia — even seizures. But the important thing to keep in mind is that so far, there’s been no sign of person-to-person spread of H5N1.

The term may also be applied to the sudden emergence of devastating natural phenomena, such as earthquakes or tornadoes. pandemic: An outbreak of disease that affects a large proportion of the population across much or most of the world. Among the most notable in recent decades was the years-long global COVID-19 pandemic, which was formally proclaimed by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. pneumonia: A lung disease in which infection by a virus or bacterium causes inflammation and tissue damage. Sometimes the lungs fill with fluid or mucus. Symptoms include fever, chills, cough and trouble breathing. policy: A plan, stated guidelines or agreed-upon rules of action to apply in certain specific circumstances. For instance, a school could have a policy on when to permit snow days or how many excused absences it would allow a student in a given year. population: (in biology) A group of individuals (belonging to the same species) that lives in a given area. poultry: Chickens, ducks, geese, pheasants and turkeys that are raised by people. In the wild, these same birds are referred to as fowl. pup: A term given to the young of many animals, from dogs and mice to seals. range: The full extent or distribution of something. For instance, a plant or animal’s range is the area over which it naturally exists. (in math or for measurements) The extent to which values can vary (such as the highest to lowest temperatures). Also, the distance within which something can be reached or perceived. risk: The chance or mathematical likelihood that some bad thing might happen. For instance, exposure to radiation poses a risk of cancer. Or the hazard — or peril — itself. (For instance: Among cancer risks that the people faced were radiation and drinking water tainted with arsenic.) RNA: A molecule that helps “read” the genetic information contained in DNA. A cell’s molecular machinery reads DNA to create RNA, and then reads RNA to create proteins. Salmonella: A genus of bacteria that can cause disease in people and animals. seizure: A sudden and fleeting uncontrolled “storm” in the brain. While underway, it alters the brain’s electrical and chemical activity. It can change someone’s movements, behaviors — even whether they’re conscious. Some people are aware as they are having seizure; others won’t remember it once it ends. Someone with recurring seizures is usually diagnosed with epilepsy. species: A group of similar organisms capable of producing offspring that can survive and reproduce. strain: (in biology) Organisms that belong to the same species that share some small but definable characteristics. For example, biologists breed certain strains of mice that may have a particular susceptibility to disease. Certain bacteria or viruses may develop one or more mutations that turn them into a strain that is immune to the ordinarily lethal effect of one or more drugs. symptom: A physical or mental indicator generally regarded to be characteristic of a disease. Sometimes a single symptom — especially a general one, such as fever or pain — can be a sign of any of many different types of injury or disease. vaccine: (v. vaccinate) A biological mixture that resembles a disease-causing agent. It is given to help the body create immunity to a particular disease. The injections used to administer most vaccines are known as vaccinations. variant: A version of something that may come in different forms. (in biology) Members of a species that possess some feature (size, coloration or lifespan, for example) that make them distinct. (in genetics) A gene having a slight mutation that may have left its host species somewhat better adapted for its environment. veterinarian: A doctor who studies or treats animals (not humans). virus: Tiny infectious particles consisting of genetic material (RNA or DNA) surrounded by protein. Viruses can reproduce only by injecting their genetic material into the cells of living creatures. Although scientists frequently refer to viruses as live or dead, in fact many scientists argue that no virus is truly alive. It doesn’t eat like animals do, or make its own food the way plants do. It must hijack the cellular machinery of a living cell in order to survive. Citations Report: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. CDC A(H5N1) bird flu response update. September 20, 2024.

He also provided an update about vaccine availability for COVID-19, influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).Social SharingAppointments to get vaccinated for influenza and COVID-19 are now available in Nova Scotia. People can get vaccinated by booking online, calling 1-833-797-7772 or using the YourHealthNS app. People can also get the shots from family doctors, nurse practitioners and mobile clinics. Nova Scotia Health recommended everyone aged six months and older get vaccinated to prevent the spread of these respiratory viruses. Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia's chief medical officer of health, said the first appointments will be on Oct. 12 for influenza and Oct. 18 for COVID-19. "We are starting to see some cases of influenza and [respiratory syncytial virus] RSV, so those viruses are starting to emerge in Nova Scotia," he said, noting this is not uncommon, with the typical surges in those viruses happening in December and into January and February. Unlike other years, patients do not have the option of what brand of COVID-19 vaccine they get. People over 65 will have access to an enhanced influenza vaccine. New COVID-19 testing requirementsAdditionally, the COVID-19 testing requirements have changed. With polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and rapid tests in short supply, the province is limiting their use to those who are high-risk and have symptoms. Both influenza and COVID-19 have symptoms such as high fever, headaches, general pain, fatigue, a runny nose, sneezing and a sore throat.Last summer, Nova Scotia saw a surge of COVID-19, with 746 new cases and 21 long-term care outbreaks reported from July 21 to Aug. 24Strang said if you have symptoms but are not a high-risk individual, you should stay home until the acute symptoms pass to avoid exposing others and, if that is not possible, wear a mask. "We really ask the public that, if you're not in one of the groups that actually needs a rapid test to know if you have COVID or not, please do not take rapid tests out in the community. Leave them for those who need them," he said. Shelly McNeil, medical director at Nova Scotia Health's emerging and re-emerging infections network, said take-home tests will still be available for high-risk people who cannot access testing facilities.MORE STORIES:14-year-old girl pleads guilty to manslaughter in Halifax teen's stabbing deathHalifax lawyer who died was accused of extorting explicit photos from troubled clients'Aggressive' water company appeals N.S. government's decision to cancel permitMan charged with 2nd-degree murder in East Preston homicideThat crinkly medical exam paper?

US/World Flu Shots Less Effective In South: Why CDC Urges Vaccination Despite Similar U.S. Forecast Published Oct 07, 2024 1:51 AM EDT By Suneeta Sunny Apart from vaccination, for high-risk groups, the CDC further recommends the use of antiviral treatments to reduce the severity of infections and prevent complications. Image by wayhomestudio on Freepik Share on Twitter Share on Facebook Share on Pocket The influenza vaccine has been less effective in the southern hemisphere this year, a recent report from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention,(CDC) revealed.The flu shot reduced the risk of hospitalization among high-risk groups by 35% in five South American countries, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay, according to the interim vaccine effectiveness report by the CDC. High-risk individuals include young children, older adults, and those with pre-existing conditions.Although the vaccine effectiveness rate is still significant, it is a notable drop from last year's 51.9% in these countries. The CDC warns that similar results are expected in the U.S. this winter if A(H3N2) viruses dominate the 2024-25 flu season. Every year, influenza results in 716,000–829,000 hospitalizations and 41,007–71,710 deaths in the Americas.However, the current vaccine effectiveness estimate highlights the need to boost vaccination rates, as getting the flu shot still remains crucial for protecting high-risk groups from serious complications, according to the CDC."These interim vaccine effectiveness estimates suggest that although the proportion of hospitalized patients who were vaccinated was modest, vaccination with the Southern Hemisphere influenza vaccine significantly lowered the risk of hospitalization. Northern Hemisphere countries should, therefore, anticipate the need for robust influenza vaccination campaigns and early antiviral treatment to achieve optimal protection against influenza-associated complications," the CDC report said."This evaluation suggests that while only one in five SARI patients had received the 2024 influenza vaccine, those who were vaccinated were at significantly lower risk for hospitalization from any influenza virus infection, including the predominant influenza A(H3N2) and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 subtypes," the report stated.This year, the flu shots are targeted to protect against widely circulating strains of H1N1, H3N2, and influenza B virus. The CDC strongly advises everyone aged 6 months and older who is eligible to get the seasonal influenza vaccine in the U.S.According to a CDC spokesperson, the effectiveness of the vaccine against the H1N1 strain is still "within the range" of previous seasons."Overall, flu vaccination reduced the risk of hospitalization by about one-third, which would have a significant impact on disease burden. Receiving a flu vaccine can offer significant protection against severe outcomes," David Daigle, the CDC spokesperson told CBS News.Apart from vaccination, for high-risk groups, the CDC further recommends using antiviral treatments to reduce the severity of infections and prevent complications. Meanwhile, the public is also urged to use nonpharmaceutical measures, such as hand washing and masks to reduce the risk of contracting the virus.
