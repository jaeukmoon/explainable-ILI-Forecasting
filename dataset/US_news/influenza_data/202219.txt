Here, we analyze both the first 1918 IAV genomes from Europe and the first from samples prior to the autumn peak. 1918 IAV genomic diversity is consistent with a combination of local transmission and long-distance dispersal events. Comparison of genomes before and during the pandemic peak shows variation at two sites in the nucleoprotein gene associated with resistance to host antiviral response, pointing at a possible adaptation of 1918 IAV to humans. Finally, local molecular clock modeling suggests a pure pandemic descent of seasonal H1N1 IAV as an alternative to the hypothesis of origination through an intrasubtype reassortment.

Medical and historical reports from that period have long represented the only direct source of information on this event, which caused the death of 50–100 million people worldwide1. Based on these, we know that the disease was recognized nearly simultaneously across continents in the summer of 1918, peaked in the autumn of 1918 and continued through the winter of 1919. While young children and the elderly were severely affected, the 1918 pandemic stood out as causing exceptionally high mortality in healthy 20–40 years-old people. Its duration, high death toll and unusual epidemiology all contributed to its profound impact on societies of that time2.That the pandemic was caused by a virus was already speculated in 19183, but only finally proven in the 1930s, when evidence of disease associated with influenza viruses was obtained. The characterization of viruses from the 1918 pandemic only began much later once suitable molecular analysis tools were developed. In the late 1990s, studies on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue blocks and permafrost-preserved bodies from victims of the 1918 pandemic ascertained that the causative agent was an influenza A virus (IAV) of the H1N1 subtype4,5. Since then, two complete IAV genomes have been reconstructed from victims who died in September 1918 at Camp Upton, New York (hereafter CU)6 and in November 1918 at Brevig Mission, Alaska (hereafter BM)7. In addition, 15 partial and one complete sequence of the hemagglutinin (HA) gene have been obtained from other influenza victims who succumbed between May 1918 and February 1919 in the USA (n = 14) and the UK (n = 2)8,9.These sequences offered some insights into the origins and aftermaths of the pandemic, as well as into the virus phenotype. At least seven segments (all except HA) harbored by the 1918 virus appeared to be drawn from the diversity of IAV strains circulating in an avian reservoir and these were passed on to seasonal H1N1 influenza viruses10,11. The reconstruction of an infectious 1918 virus based on the BM genome sequence showed that the HA and polymerase complex genes were likely major determinants of this virus pathogenicity12,13. Yet, many questions remain unaddressed or are still debated, largely as a result of the paucity of sequence information. For example, how much genomic diversity was generated during the pandemic? Was the change in severity observed between the pre- and pandemic peak periods ascribable to distinct viral genetic features? And, what was the origin of HA in subsequent seasonal H1N1 viruses?Obtaining a large collection of genomes is likely beyond reach since permafrost-preserved bodies and pathology specimens of victims of the pandemic are rare. While the few sequences we might be in the position to generate may well be insufficient to comprehensively answer the aforementioned questions, they may still offer new valuable insights if representative of key timepoints and locations in the epidemic. Therefore, we applied recent advances in nucleic acid recovery from archival samples6,14 to as-yet unexplored European pathology collection material, including the medical archive started by Rudolf Virchow in mid 1800s Germany15. This enabled us to sequence two partial and one complete 1918 influenza virus genomes from specimens sampled in Berlin and Munich, two of which derive from the pre-pandemic peak period, which we used to start revisiting a number of hypotheses about the 1918 influenza virus.Results and discussion1918 influenza virus genomes from Munich and BerlinTo explore the emergence, pandemic and post-pandemic periods, we selected 13 formalin-fixed lung specimens dated between 1900 and 1931, preserved within the Berlin Museum of Medical History at the Charité (Berlin, Germany, n = 11) and the pathology collection (Narrenturm) of the Natural History Museum in Vienna, Austria (n = 2). This set included six specimens collected during pandemic years in Europe (n = 4 in 1918, n = 2 in 1919). Details about all specimens, including initial diagnosis, are presented in Table 1 and in the Methods section. For each specimen, we heat treated 200 mg of formalin-fixed lung tissue to reverse macromolecule cross-links induced by formalin16, then performed nucleic acid extraction. Following DNase treatment and ribosomal RNA depletion, we built high-throughput sequencing libraries and shotgun sequenced them on Illumina® platforms.Table 1 Details on the archival samples used in this study.Full size tableWe identified IAV reads in libraries from 3 of 13 specimens, all of which date to 1918 and were associated with histopathological findings of bronchopneumonia (Fig. 1a; Supplementary Note 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1). Viral RNA preservation was generally good, as shown by median fragment lengths well above 100 nucleotides and the lack of any obvious damage pattern (Supplementary Figs. 2–3). Human RNA fragments were on average shorter, possibly indicating better protection of viral RNA inside virions (Supplementary Note 2). We did not detect any other viral agent likely to be involved in severe respiratory disease, but identified a number of bacteria which have been previously associated with respiratory diseases (e.g. Mycobacterium kansasii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in specimens that did not produce influenza reads) and with 1918 influenza (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pasteurella multocida, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae); in 2 specimens bacterial colonization was also evident from histopathology (Supplementary Note 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1).Fig. 1: Positive specimens and influenza A virus genomic coverage.Specimens positive for influenza A virus (a) and comparison of all available 1918 influenza A virus genomes (b). We identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the new genomes using BM as a reference; for BM and CU, we plotted SNPs unique to these genomes. Missing information represents areas where we did not get any coverage or this was lower than our consensus calling criteria.Full size imageIncreased sequencing efforts for the three influenza-positive samples MU-162 (Munich), BE-572 and BE-576 (Berlin) yielded 40.133.161, 31.989.479 and 14.965.377 high quality reads, respectively. Of these, 55.5%, 0.33% and 0.1% mapped to the influenza A/Brevig Mission/1/1918 virus, which allowed us to reconstruct a complete 1918 influenza virus genome at a 1944x average coverage depth for MU-162, as well as significant portions of the genomes for BE-572 and BE-576 (89.3% and 57.2%, at an average coverage depth of 53x and 9x, respectively).Genomic variation of 1918 viruses and potential impact on polymerase complex activityTogether with the available BM and CU sequences, we first used these German influenza genomes to assess the genomic diversity of strains sampled in different geographical locations and months. A genomic map summarizing all nucleotide differences is presented in Fig. 1b (detailed discussion in Supplementary Note 3). The two partial genomes from Berlin sampled in June 1918 differed at a maximum of two sites, in HA (Supplementary Fig. 4), suggesting that within-outbreak variability may have been negligible at this location and timepoint. We acknowledge that this comparison was based on only a third of the viral genome, potentially representing an underestimation of local diversity. When comparing the nearly complete BE-572 genome to the other German sequence from Munich (MU-162), 22 SNPs were identified, resembling the difference previously reported for the two North American genomes6. Comparison between European and North American genomes revealed 22-43 SNPs. Finally, when comparing the pre-pandemic peak (June 1918) European BE-572 genome with pandemic peak genomes CU (September 1918) and BM (November 1918), we identified 22 and 29 SNPs, respectively. Overall, these comparisons show that measurable genomic variability was present, and that genomes sampled on the same continents (0.11-0.16%) and during the same period of the pandemic (0.11%) exhibited lower overall divergence than genomes sampled on different continents (0.16-0.32%), and during different periods (0.16-0.21%). This pattern is compatible with spatio-temporal effects of local transmission.To evaluate whether the genomic differences observed may have had a phenotypic impact, we conducted exploratory investigations in vitro. To the best of our knowledge, no such comparisons have been made between the genomes from North America. We focused on the MU-162 virus, for which we obtained a high-quality complete genome sequence, and on the BM virus, the only 1918 IAV ever reconstructed and characterized phenotypically12. Since the polymerase complex contained most of the coding mutations found in MU-162 (4 in PB2, 2 in PB1, 3 in PA and 1 in NP proteins, Supplementary Fig. 4), and is a major pathogenicity factor for BM, we resynthesized viral genes and performed a functional comparison of the activity of BM and MU-162 polymerases after reconstitution in transfected cells. Using reporter assays, dose response curves revealed a two-fold higher activity of BM compared to MU-162 polymerase (Fig. 2a).Fig. 2: In vitro activity of reconstituted BM and MU-162 polymerases by mini-genome reporter assay.a Dose response of transfected MU-162 (here referred to as MU) polymerase in comparison to BM activity, arbitrarily set to 100%. b Effect of whole segment swapping. Comparative analysis of BM and MU-162 polymerase complexes expressed as wild type (wt) or as reassorted 3 + 1 combinations. c Effect of single BM-to-MU-162 aa changes in the context of the BM polymerase. Each assay was conducted in n = 3 independent replicates with experimental triplicates. Values are means ± SD. Significance was determined by nested ANOVA. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ****P < 0.0001. All three lower panels depict the expression levels of polymerase subunits by immunoblot analyses. A representative result of n = 3 independent assays is shown. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageTo identify the subunit(s) responsible for this difference, we determined the effect of swapping single polymerase subunits between BM and MU-162 (Fig. 2b). The introduction of PA from MU-162 into the BM polymerase complex caused a 1.7-fold reduction of its activity (Fig. 2b, P < 0.0001). In line with this finding, BM PA increased the activity of the MU-162 polymerase by 1.7-fold (P < 0.0001). Exchange of PB1 and PB2 subunits caused a similar, but more modest impact on activity. No effect was recorded upon exchange of NP proteins.To more precisely pinpoint the genetic determinants of the observed phenotypic differences, we generated BM point mutants, each carrying one of the amino acid (aa) changes identified in the MU-162 virus. Five mutations distributed across PA (3), PB1 (1) and PB2 (1) significantly reduced the activity of the polymerase compared to BMwt (Fig. 2c). These results indicate that, in vitro, amino acid changes differentiating MU-162 and BM affect the activity of the viral RNA polymerase complex, which has a critical role in balancing viral virulence17.Assessing whether the observed differences would translate into distinct phenotypes comes with a lot of uncertainty. Similar fold differences observed for other highly pathogenic IAVs isolated from humans have been associated with an increase in virus replication and virulence18. Yet, it is also known that polymerase activity and viral virulence are not always linearly correlated17,19. In addition, our analyses also pinpointed the uncertain origin of a mutation found in BM PA (Supplementary Note 3). With these caveats in mind, we conclude that if our findings do not necessarily predict functional differences in vivo, they are, at this stage, compatible with the notion of phenotypically polymorphic 1918 influenza viruses and should encourage future research on the question, using more viral sequences and possibly reconstructed viruses.Geographic spread and functional evolution of the 1918 virus during the pandemicTo investigate to what extent the collective evidence generated thus far informs us about how the pandemic unfolded, we combined the newly generated genomes with previously published 1918 sequences. We first focused on the question of the geographic spread of the 1918 virus. For this, we took advantage of the availability of a total of 21 HA sequences sampled in Europe and North America before and during the pandemic period to infer a time-scaled evolutionary history in a Bayesian phylogenetic framework20. This reconstruction showed the interspersed clustering of the three German sequences with the North American ones, suggesting no geographic segregation between continents (Fig. 3). Similarly, two sequences sampled three months apart in London during the 1918-1919 pandemic winter (November 1918 and February 1919, respectively) clustered separately, albeit with moderate support (posterior probability 0.88, Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 5). Models in which monophyletic clustering was enforced on the European lineages showed a decisively lower model fit (ln Bayes factor [BF] ≥ 8.9, Supplementary Note 4), supporting the hypothesis of transatlantic movement of pandemic viruses, in line with the historical context of human movement near the end of World War I. Altogether, genomic data support a scenario of predominantly local transmission with frequent long-distance dispersal events.Fig. 3: Time-scaled phylogeny reconstructed based on HA sequences from 1918 flu strains.US sequences are in gray, European sequences are in dark red (Germany) and dark green (UK). Dashed rectangles highlight clades comprising strains from different continents and with posterior support ≥0.75; for these clades posterior probabilities are reported above stem branches. The season column indicates from which season the samples originate, with light gray for the pre-pandemic peak period (spring and summer) and dark gray for the pandemic peak period (autumn and winter). The amino acid residues at HA position 222 and NP positions 16 and 283 are also indicated. ‘?’ indicate the absence of information. Numbers between brackets next to the root node indicate the 95% Highest Posterior Density (HPD) of its estimated age. The BE-576 consensus genome with ambiguities was used in this analysis; an equivalent reconstruction using majority rule consensus base calling can be found in Supplementary Fig. 5.Full size imageNext, we focused on the evolutionary relationships between viruses of the different periods of the 1918 pandemic. For this, we used the same HA sequence dataset, this time to assess whether pandemic peak viruses descended from a single global replacement of pre-pandemic peak viruses. Under such a scenario, the pandemic peak viruses should constitute a single monophyletic lineage. However, the data strongly support the alternative scenario (ln BF support ≥ 10.1), where multiple pre-pandemic peak lineages survived into the following pandemic months. Both the lack of strong geographical stratification, and the survival of initial lineages over a time frame covering pre- and post-pandemic peak periods (280 days) are dynamics shared with the 2009 H1N1 pandemic (Supplementary Note 4).We then specifically searched for potential adaptations of the virus that could have arisen between the pre- and pandemic peak period and might have contributed to the increased severity of the latter2. The presence of the aa residue G222 in the receptor binding domain of the H1 subtype HA protein has already been discussed in this context8. This residue confers a binding affinity for both avian and human glycans, while the human-like D222 only efficiently binds human glycans21,22. In a recent study, three of four pre-pandemic peak sequences presented G222 in contrast to only two of nine pandemic peak sequences (all other sequences presented D222)8. The three German HA sequenced here carried the human-like D222, which reduces the likelihood that the frequency of the two variants varied significantly between the pre- and pandemic peak periods.The availability of genome-wide information about two 1918 summer strains allowed us to identify two other aa changes that potentially mark an important difference between pre- and pandemic peak periods. We found that pre-peak strains BE-572 and BE-576 carried avian-like residues at position 16 (G) and 283 (L) of NP, whereas the peak strains and MU-162 (unknown sampling date) carried D16 and P283, as found in most human H1N1 strains with the exception of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus (see references23,24,25,26 and Supplementary Fig. 6). These two sites are known to influence host range and susceptibilityesistance to the interferon-induced MxA antiviral protein23,24,27: position 283 is located in the body of NP, and a proline at this site confers resistance to the human MxA protein, to which D16 also contributes, albeit to a lower extent24,26. These mutations may represent hallmarks of early adaptation to humans: during the first months of their spread, 1918 influenza viruses may have evolved a better capacity to evade the innate interferon response, which is an important aspect of influenza virus pathogenicity.1918 influenza viruses and the origin of human seasonal H1N1 influenza virusesThe sequencing of BM offered the opportunity to test for a pandemic origin of seasonal H1N1 segments. It is to be expected that in phylogenetic trees the pandemic origin of a segment should translate into BM being basal to seasonal influenza, and that in time-scaled phylogenetic trees their most recent common ancestor (MRCA) should then date back to or shortly precede pandemic years. Multiple modeling approaches have been implemented to investigate the question and their output have been interpreted as supporting different scenarios5,11. The latest of these efforts made use of molecular clock models allowing for host-specific rates of nucleotide evolution (thereafter host-specific local clocks; HSLC). These suggested that seven seasonal H1N1 segments originated in birds, while the eighth (HA) arose from a co-circulating homosubtypic H1 IAV through intrasubtype reassortment, in agreement with other non-genetic information11.We revisited this hypothesis with our extended sequence data set, that now comprised multiple 1918 virus sequences for all segments, using approaches incorporating or not a molecular clock model. Non-clock maximum likelihood (ML) reconstructions indicated that human seasonal H1N1 and 1918 pandemic viruses cluster together with reasonably high bootstrap support, with the seasonal lineage nested within the 1918 pandemic variants for all segments but PB2 (Supplementary Fig. 7). Time-measured phylogenetic inference using a HSLC model found that for all internal gene segments the human seasonal lineage nests within pandemic flu diversity, while for HA and NA pandemic viruses form a monophyletic cluster with swine influenza viruses, which is positioned as a sister lineage to human seasonal lineage11 (Fig. 4a vs b, Supplementary Fig. 8).Fig. 4: Time-measured phylogenetic patterns and evolutionary rates estimated using Bayesian molecular clock modeling.a The phylogenetic pattern for HA and NA inferred using a standard host-specific local clock (HSLC) model. b A monophyletic cluster for human pandemic and seasonal viruses estimated for HA and NA using an extended HSLC model (and using either model for all other segments). The star denotes the branch that is allowed to have a separate evolutionary rate in the HSLCext model. c Evolutionary rate estimates for the human lineage (first box) and the seasonal ancestral branch (second box) under the extended HSLC model for each segment ordered according to difference in these two rates. The boxes are colored according to the dN/dS estimate for the human lineage and the seasonal ancestral branch in each segment. The horizontal line in the whisker plots represents the mean. The lower and upper bounds of the boxes indicate the first and third quartile, respectively. Vertical lines are the upper and lower whisker representing the minimum of the largest value and 1.5 times the inter quartile distance, respectively the maximum of the smallest value and 1.5 times the inter quartile distance. Sample size from the MCMC chain is 2702 for NA and 4502 for all other segments. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageBecause of the apparent conflict between the HA and NA phylogenies inferred with both approaches (Fig. 4a, Supplementary Fig. 9), we explored an alternative scenario that allows for a higher evolutionary rate on the branch ancestral to the seasonal lineage. Such a scenario would result in considerably higher divergence between pandemic and seasonal viruses for H1 and N1 than would be expected under a strict clock, and could therefore induce a sister lineage pattern with a relatively deep MRCA under the HSLC model - which assumes a different but constant rate of evolution in each of the host-specific lineages. We ran simulations that showed that if the rate is elevated on the relevant branch, and this is not accounted for in the clock model, the HSLC inference generally fails to recover the seasonal lineage as a direct descendant of the pandemic virus (Supplementary Fig. 10). Fitting an extended HSLC model that allows for a separate rate on the relevant branch inferred the seasonal lineage as a descendant of the pandemic virus in both HA and NA, consistent with the non-clock trees.Across segments, this model resulted in consistently higher posterior mean rates on the seasonal ancestral branch compared to the seasonal clade rates (Fig. 4), but with a variability that largely reflected the variation in selective constraints on the segments. Less stringent purifying selection in HA and NA, as reflected in higher nonsynonymous/synonymous substitution rate ratios (Fig. 4c), accompanied by a stronger rate acceleration potentially explains the observed patterns. To investigate whether variation in selection pressures could explain the acceleration on the branch leading to the seasonal lineage, we performed selection analyses using codon substitution models. These models did not identify diversifying episodic selection or relaxed selective constraints on this branch in any of the segments, implying that only mutation rate/generation time effects may explain the branch-specific elevated rate. Interestingly, a higher mutation rate for the seasonal predecessor (due to a higher replication rate) has indeed been suggested by some experimental evidence comparing BM to seasonal strains12,28.Altogether, these new analyses are compatible with the scenario of a pure pandemic origin of seasonal H1N1 viruses. However, the essentially phenomenological nature of our modeling approach does not, for now, allow us to definitely favor it over the alternative scenario of a homosubtypic reassortment.In general, we acknowledge that, due to our very small sample size (three complete and two partial genomes), all findings reported here remain preliminary. Additional genomes from archival samples surrounding the pandemic period, as well as phenotypic characterization of multiple 1918 viruses in vitro and in vivo, will undoubtedly provide the opportunity for more robust tests of our hypotheses. The fact that three out of the six archival samples we analyzed from pandemic years yielded good quality viral RNA underscores the enormous potential of genomic research of medical collections, which can now be considered a low risk-high gain enterprise. Therefore, we anticipate that the main obstacle to a better understanding of the evolution of 1918 flu viruses will lie in the identification of preserved pathological specimens. Unfortunately, such specimens are rare and hard to localize, which highlights the importance of long-neglected museum activities29. Guaranteeing proper long-term storage conditions of biological specimens, as well as digitizing and transcribing the associated written sources (e.g. dissection protocols), are essential steps to take to preserve and use the remaining sparse collections still holding substantial archival material.MethodsSamplesEthics approval was obtained from the ethics committee of the Charité (Berlin, Germany) under the reference number EA4/212/19. We obtained 11 lung samples from formalin-fixed specimens identified in the collection of the Berlin Museum of Medical History at the Charité (Berlin, Germany). Sample 447/1913 (sample ID/year of collection) was taken from a 21-year-old (yo) male with a pathological report of fresh confluent pneumonia of the lower lung lobes. Sample 876/1913 was taken from a 45-yo male with a pathological report of calluses on the pleura. Samples 1150/1914 and 928/1915 were taken from a 16-yo and 9½ month-old male, respectively, with a pathological report of tuberculosis. Sample MU-162 was taken from a 17-yo female who died of influenza-related pneumonia in Munich in 1918. The exact collection date was not reported. The pathological finding reported the presence of purulent bronchitis, bronchiolitis and bi-lateral confluent bronchopneumonia. Sample BE-572 was taken from a 18-yo male soldier who died in Berlin on June 27th 1918. The pathological findings were severe purulent pseudomembranous tracheobronchitis and purulent hemorrhagic bronchopneumonia. Sample BE-576 was taken from a 17-yo male soldier who died of influenza in Berlin on June 27th 1918. The pathological findings were fibrinous bronchitis and purulent hemorrhagic bronchopneumonia. Sample 1068/1918 was taken from a 13-yo female. The main pathological finding was fibrinous pseudomembranous bronchitis. Sample 84/1919 was taken from a 55-yo male who died with a caseous pneumonia of the left pulmonary lobe. Sample 247/1919 was taken from a 32-yo woman with tuberculosis who died in Munich. Pathological findings included chronic lung tuberculosis with bronchiectasis, typical lung cavernae and pneumonia. Sample 112/1920 was taken from a 6-month-old individual (gender not reported) who died of influenza. The pathological report included purulent bronchitis and bronchopneumonia, double-sided empyema and collapse of both lungs. Since the exact composition and concentration of the formalin fixative was unknown, we stored the lung samples in PBS to avoid further damage to nucleic acids by adding fresh formalin. Our sample set was further expanded with two formalin-fixed lung specimens preserved within the pathology collection (Narrenturm) of the Natural History Museum in Vienna, Austria, cataloged as influenza-related pneumonia. Sample 18.560/684 originated from the Spital Rudolfstiftung in Vienna and was taken from a child who died on January 6th 1900 with a diagnosis of influenza-related pneumonia. Sample 15.929 originated from the University of Graz and was taken from a 23-yo man who died in 1931. The pathological findings were confluent influenza-related pneumonia with gangrenous cavernae and acute empyema. After sampling, the specimens from the Narrenturm were preserved dry.Sample preparationTo minimize contamination, all steps prior to sequencing were performed in an ancient DNA laboratory.RNA extractionTo maximize chances of viral RNA recovery, we performed 8 separate total nucleic acid extractions from different areas of the lung using the DNeasy® Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen) with modifications for formalin-fixed samples, that has been demonstrated to effectively recover both RNA and DNA from such samples30. For each separate extraction, a pea-sized piece (ca. 25 mg) of lung was washed in 1 ml PBS to remove residual fixative. The washed tissue was cut into smaller pieces using sterile scissors and added to bead tubes containing tissue lysis buffer (ATL). To reverse formalin-induced crosslinking16, the tissue was heated to 98 °C for 15 min. To facilitate lysis, the tissue was homogenized by bead beating with a Fast Prep® (MP Biomedicals). We added 20 µl Proteinase K and kept the homogenate at 56 °C until the tissue was completely lysed (ca. 1 h). Subsequent steps were performed according to protocol and nucleic acid was eluted in 35 µl elution buffer (AE).Library preparationTo maximize viral RNA in the final sequencing libraries, we removed DNA and ribosomal RNA from the nucleic acid extracts before conversion to double-stranded cDNA. For DNase treatment we used the TURBO DNA-free™ Kit (Ambion). To reduce costs for rRNA depletion, 4 DNase-treated extracts were pooled and concentrated using RNA Clean & Concentrator-5 Kit (Zymo Research) and eluted in 13 µl nuclease free water as input for one ribosomal RNA depletion reaction. The other 4 extracts were treated separately. We performed ribosomal RNA depletion and clean-up using the NEBNext® rRNA Depletion Kit (Human/Mouse/Rat) with RNA Sample Purification Beads (New England Biolabs) according to protocol. Following bead clean-up RNA was eluted in 12 µl nuclease free water. We performed cDNA synthesis, using the SuperScript™ IV First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen) and converted cDNA into ds DNA with the NEBNEXT® mRNA Second Strand Synthesis Module (New England Biolabs). Double-stranded DNA was purified using MagSi-NGSprep Plus Beads (Steinbrenner Laborsysteme) and eluted in 50 µl TET. We prepared 5 separate libraries with the NEBNext® Ultra™ II DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina® (New England Biolabs) without prior fragmentation of double-stranded cDNA and without size-selection upon adapter ligation. All clean-up steps during the library preparation were conducted with MagSi-NGSprep Plus Beads (Steinbrenner Laborsysteme). The libraries were dual indexed with NEBNext® Multiplex Oligos for Illumina® (New England Biolabs), quantified using the KAPA Library Quantification Illumina Universal Kit (Roche), amplified with the KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix (Roche) and Illumina adapter-specific primers, and diluted to a concentration of 4 nM for sequencing.SequencingLibraries were sequenced on an Illumina® MiSeq platform using the v3 chemistry (2 × 300-cycle) and on the Illumina® NextSeq platform using v2 chemistry (2 × 150-cycle).NGS data analysesRaw reads were pre-processed using Trimmomatic31, with the following settings: LEADING:30 TRAILING:30 SLIDINGWINDOW:4:40 MINLEN:40. Reads were initially classified using Kraken232. Trimmed reads were then mapped to the A/Brevig Mission/1/1918 (BM) reference genome (GenBank accession numbers AY130766, AF333238, AF250356, AF116575, AY744935, DQ208309-11) using BWA-MEM33. Upon detection of influenza reads in sample MU-162, we proceeded with de novo assembly using metaSPAdes34. Scaffolds greater than 750 bp (the smallest BM segment is 830 bp) were blasted against a database of influenza virus sequences and all 8 viral segments were identified. The 8 segments resulting from the de novo assembly were then used as a reference for reference-based mapping of reads generated from sample MU-162 and all other samples included in this study. To minimize the effects of cross-library sequence bleed-through, we discarded data where samples were co-sequenced with MU-162. Upon trimming, paired end reads were merged using the Clip&Merge tools from EAGER35. We sorted mapping files and removed duplicates using the SortSam and MarkDuplicates tools from Picard (http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard). We assessed RNA damage using mapDamage v236. Base calling for MU-162 was set to 20 reads and 95% agreement whereas for BE-572 and BE-576 to 3 reads and 50% agreement. Recombination analyses for the PA segment were run in Rdp4 using the PA dataset assembled by Worobey et al.10 We reduced the dataset to unique sequences using FaBox37 and then chose the 99 most ancient ones to analyze with the MU-162 sequence. We ran Rdp438 with all methods (changing the settings of the bootscan approach to a window size of 100). Geneconv, bootscan, lard and 3seq identified Brevig as a recombinant (MU-162 backbone with a ca. 100 bp originating in another virus). PhyML39 was finally run on the backbone and recombinant region.The influenza positive samples were analyzed for human RNA preservation. The sequencing data was processed using EAGER35. Sequencing reads were inspected with FastQC before merging and adapter trimming with AdapterRemoval V2.2.1a. Pre-processed reads were then aligned to the human transcriptome reference (Gencode, Release 34), using BWA with a minimum quality score of 0 and a maximum edit distance of 0.01. The MarkDuplicates method was used for duplicate processing (Broad Institute) as well as DamageProfiler v0.3.8 and Qualimap40 to investigate the read length distribution and the damage patterns.In agreement with the ethics committee of the Charité, Berlin, human reads were removed from the sequencing files prior to uploading them to the European Nucleotide Archive. Filtered reads were mapped to the human RefSeq genome assembly GRCh38.p13 (GCF_000001405.39) using BWA-MEM33. Unmapped reads were extracted using SAMtools41 v1.3.1 and then extracted by name from the original fastq files using seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk).Evolutionary analyses and simulationsDatasetsFor the HA and NA segments, the newly generated pandemic H1N1 sequence data were complemented with the collection of human, swine and avian H1 and N1 sequences previously used by Worobey et al.11. The A/London/1/1919 isolate9 was also added to the HA data. The newly sequenced samples from Berlin differ from each other in HA at two positions (alignment positions 356 and 1600). BE-576 is polymorphic at these positions with ~40% of the reads exactly matching the BE-572 HA sequence. It can hence not be excluded that BE-576 is identical to BE-572, and that the majority rule consensus base calls at these positions reflect the amplification of potential RNA damages/RT or PCR errors. For this reason, all HA analyses were run in duplicate, once with the majority rule consensus sequence, and once with these positions represented by the appropriate ambiguity code. For the other segments, except for NS, the new 1918 pandemic flu data were complemented with the human H1N1 viruses, the classical swine flu strains and Eastern plus Western avian lineages from the final datasets used by Worobey et al.10 downloaded from Dryad. For NS, all human and swine lineages selected by Worobey et al.10 were used, but only a subset of the avian taxa was taken along to not have to enforce monophyly constraints on the human seasonal and pandemic lineages when accounting for the host-specific evolutionary rates (see below). The region in PA identified as of uncertain origin in the Brevig Mission sequence was not included (masked) for analysis.Evolutionary analysesSequences were aligned with MAFFT v7.31342 and Aliview v1.1943 was used for manual refinement of the alignments. Maximum likelihood (ML) trees for all datasets were reconstructed using IQTREE 2.044 with a general time-reversible (GTR) nucleotide substitution model45 and a discretized gamma distribution to model among-site rate heterogeneity. Bootstrap support was estimated using the ultra-fast bootstrap procedure with 1000 pseudo-replicates46. Time-measured phylogenies were estimated using BEAST v1.1020 with the same substitution model settings as for the ML trees. The skygrid model was used as a flexible demographic tree prior47. To accommodate host-specific rates in the estimation of divergence times, we employed a molecular clock model that allows for different evolutionary rates in lineages of different host species10. The standard host-specific local clock (HSLCstd) model specifies the avian influenza virus rate as the background rate, and assumes a different rate for the human (and swine) lineage, and yet another separate rate for the swine lineage specifically. To keep the model identifiable, we constrain a monophyletic cluster for the human and swine lineage as well as a monophyletic cluster for the swine lineage specifically within this cluster. For this specification it remains unclear which rate to assign to the branch ancestral to the human (and swine) lineage (avian or human) and to the branch ancestral to swine lineage (human or swine). Therefore, we integrate over both alternatives for each branch using a stochastic variable selection procedure48. To reconcile the time-measured phylogenetic reconstructions with the non-clock ML tree reconstructions for the HA and NA segment, we also extend this model to allow for a separate evolutionary rate along the branch ancestral to the human seasonal lineage. We refer to this model as the extended host-specific local clock (HSLCext). We used BEAGLE 349 for efficient likelihood computation and simulate the MCMC chains sufficiently long to ensure stationarity and mixing as diagnosed using Tracer v1.7.050. We summarized posterior tree distributions in the form of maximum clade credibility (MCC) trees and visualize these trees using FigTree (http:/ree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/). Selection analyses were performed using codon substitution model approaches implemented in HyPhy51. Specifically, we tested for episodic (diversifying) selection and relaxed selection along the branch ancestral to human seasonal viruses in the human H1N1 lineage using aBSREL52 and RELAX53 respectively. For this purpose, we used the human lineage subtrees extracted from the BEAST MCC trees estimated using the HSLCext model.SimulationsWe performed two sets of sequence simulations. First, we simulated sequence data according to the BEAST estimate obtained under the HSLCstd model. We simulated 20 replicate data sets under this scenario (with the same size as the HA data set) and then evaluated the performance of both non-clock maximum likelihood reconstruction and BEAST estimation using the extended HSLC model. Second, we simulated sequence data using the same procedure, but now according to the BEAST estimate obtained under the HSLCext model and evaluated the performance of both non-clock maximum likelihood reconstruction and BEAST estimation using the standard HSLC model. Simulations were performed using piBUSS54.Functional analysesPlasmidsComplete cDNAs of influenza virus genomic segments derived from sample MU-162 or of strain A/Brevig Mission/1/1918 (H1N1, BM) were commercially synthesized. Point mutations were introduced into BM segments with the Quikchange II Site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Coding sequences of polymerase and NP proteins were amplified by PCR with the Phusion Green Hot Start II High Fidelity DNA polymerase (ThermoFisher). PCR products for PB2, PA and NP were cloned into the BsaI sites of vector pCAGGS∆Bsa-Blue55. PB1, which contains internal BsaI sites, was cloned into the BsmBI sites of a modified version of the pCAGGS plasmid. All constructs were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Primers used for cloning and mutagenesis are listed in table S1.Polymerase activity assayTrypsinized 293 T cell cultures were transiently transfected in suspension in 12 wells using lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) with 50 ng of each pCAGGS-pol plasmid, 100 ng pCAGGS-NP plasmid, and 125 ng of pPolI-NS-Luc, expressing an influenza virus-like RNA encoding a firefly luciferase17. Transfection was normalized by the constitutively expressed Renilla luciferase encoded on plasmid pTK-RL (10 ng; Promega, Madison, WI, USA). For titration experiments, a range from 12.5 to 200 ng of each pCAGGS-pol construct was used, with respective double amounts of corresponding NP plasmid, while luciferase plasmids were kept constant. Total DNA amount was equalized in every sample with pCAGGS. At 24 h post transfection, luciferase activity was measured with the Dual-Luciferase® Reporter Assays System (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) on a Tristar LB 941 luminometer (Berthold Technologies, Bad Wildbad, Germany) according to manufacturers’ instructions.ImmunoblottingEqual amounts of cell lysates from luciferase assay replicates were pooled, denatured in reducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer for 5 min at 95 °C, separated on 8% SDS gels, subjected to immunoblotting with antibodies against PB2 (rabbit, ThermoFisher/Pierce, #PAS-32221), PB1 (rabbit, ThermoFisher/Pierce, #PAS34914), PA (rabbit, GeneTex, #125932), NP (mouse, Acris, #AM00929PU-N) and actin (mouse, Sigma, #A2228), respectively and detected with HRP-labeled anti-mouse (DAKO, #P0260) or anti-rabbit antibodies (DAKO, #P0217), respectively.Statistical analysisAll values are expressed as mean, error bars indicate standard deviations of three independent biological experiments performed in technical triplicates. For multiple comparisons of several groups of a single variable (polymerase subunit exchange in Fig. 2b, mutant analysis in Fig. 2c), nested one-way ANOVA was used and P-values were corrected for multiple testing with Sidak’s method. For multiple comparisons of three or more groups with two independent variables (titration of polymerase activity as a function of plasmid concentration in Fig. 2a), nested two-way ANOVA was used and P-values were corrected for multiple testing with Sidak’s method. Curve fitting was done with regression analysis using 3rd order polynominal equations. Calculations were performed with GraphPad Prism, version 8.1.2.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.

Saving Lives, Protecting People Search Submit Influenza (Flu) Forecasts of Flu Hospitalizations May 9, 2022 Updated May 10, 2022 Minus Related Pages Reported and forecasted new influenza hospitalizations as of May 9, 2022. Interpretation of National Forecasts of New Hospitalizations This week’s ensemble predicts that the number of new weekly confirmed influenza hospital admissions will remain stable or have an uncertain trend nationally, with 1,800 to 4,600 new confirmed influenza hospital admissions likely reported in the week ending June 4, 2022. This week, 16 modeling groups contributed one or more forecasts that were eligible for inclusion in the new hospitalization ensemble forecasts for at least one jurisdiction. Contributing teams are listed below. Ensemble forecasts combine diverse independent team forecasts into one forecast. They have been among the most reliable forecasts in performance for previous influenza and COVID-19 forecasts, but even the ensemble forecasts may not reliably predict rapid changes in the trends. The figure shows the number of new confirmed influenza hospital admissions reported in the United States each week from September 26 through May 7 and forecasted new influenza hospital admissions per week over the next 4 weeks, through June 4. Effective February 2, 2022, hospitals are required to report laboratory-confirmed influenza hospitalizations to HHS Protect daily. Prior to this update, reporting influenza hospitalizations was optional (noted as grey in the above figure). See COVID-19 Guidance for Hospital Reporting and FAQs for additional details on this guidance. Download all national data [XLS – 10 KB] State Forecasts State-level forecasts show the predicted number of new influenza hospital admissions per week for the next 4 weeks by state. Each state forecast figure uses a different scale due to differences in the number of new influenza hospital admissions per week between states and only forecasts included in the ensemble are shown.

(May 11, 2022)—Federal laboratory testing confirmed cases of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza (HPAI) in samples taken from black vultures initially found sick and dead on April 22 in Harford County, Maryland. Following an investigation by the Maryland Departments of Agriculture and Natural Resources (MDA, DNR) and the U.S Department of Agriculture (USDA) Wildlife Services, the USDA National Veterinary Services Laboratory confirmed samples submitted from the dead birds tested positive for HPAI. These detections mark the Delmarva region’s first confirmation of HPAI in wild birds since February 17, when the virus was found through wildlife surveillance in a Canada goose in Kent County, Delaware. HPAI is known to be carried by wild birds, especially waterfowl, raptors, and vultures. Avian influenza is a highly contagious airborne respiratory virus that spreads quickly among birds through nasal and eye secretions and manure. As scavengers, vultures will feed on dead wildlife, including other wild birds. If they ingest the virus, they can get sick and die. It is believed the vultures contracted the virus from eating infected migratory bird species. Even with the ongoing detections of HPAI in poultry and wild birds in the United States, continuing testing of people in close contact with infected poultry indicates a low risk to the general public’s health. This H5N1 virus has not shown an ability to infect and be transmitted between people. Avian influenza does not affect poultry meat or egg products, which remain safe to eat. Properly cooking poultry and eggs to 165 degrees Fahrenheit will kill viruses or bacteria. Since the initial detection in Harford County, more than 100 black vultures have died from the disease. A total count cannot be confirmed because wild birds often get sick and die where people cannot see them. Black vultures are also known to fly long distances, which means infected vultures may die in other locations and transmit the virus to other birds, including poultry. Six farms on Maryland’s Eastern Shore and Delaware were identified as impacted by HPAI between February 23 and March 18, 2022. With the first confirmation in a commercial poultry farm, a state-federal response was initiated between the Delaware Department of Agriculture (DDA), MDA, and USDA. Considering the ongoing detections in the black vulture population, all poultry owners need to continue with increased vigilance in protecting their flocks from contracting avian influenza. Follow these steps to help manage wildlife and keep avian influenza off your farm: • Cover waste. Keep mortality and compost piles covered at all times. The recommendation is one part mortalities to two parts litter, with birds in layers no more than 5 inches deep and not placed next to sidewalls. Cover mortalities daily with litter. If vultures are still an issue, cover the bins with netting or a screen. • Remove standing water adjacent to poultry houses. Grade property to avoid pooling water. Fill or grade areas where water stands for more than 48 hours after heavy rainfall. Don’t walk or move equipment through or near standing water – this could track wildlife fecal matter or other contaminants with the virus into your barns. Never use untreated surface water for watering birds, cleaning poultry barns, or other facilities. • Manage ponds and basins on poultry farms. Prune or remove plants from banks of artificial water structures. Use wire grids, predator decoys, and scare devices to keep waterfowl away. Use fencing to separate natural ponds from the active area around barns. • Secure buildings. Regularly check and repair damaged screens on windows and doors and holes in barn walls. Install netting or screens and use repellent gel or bird spikes to deter perching. Wash away or remove old nests before each nesting season. It is unlawful to remove nests with eggs or young birds in them. • Reduce food sources. Don’t feed wildlife. Remove spilled or uneaten feed immediately and ensure feed storage units are secure and free of holes. Wild birds can carry HPAI. • Use decoys. Install decoys and scare devices and move them often so wildlife doesn’t get used to them. If you have sick poultry or experience increased mortality in your flock: • Commercial poultry producers should contact the company they grow for when they notice signs of disease. • Backyard flock owners who notice any signs of HPAI in their flock should contact: o In Delaware, email the Delaware Poultry Health Hotline at poultry.health@delaware.gov or call 302-698-4507 and provide your contact information, size of flock, location, and concerns. o In Maryland, report any unusual or sudden increases in sick birds to the MDA Animal Health Program at 410-841-5810. Commercial chicken growers and backyard flock owners can email questions about the outbreak to Birdflu@maryland.gov. If you see sick or dead wild birds, do not handle or move them.

High Path Avian Influenza Confirmed In Black Vultures, Poultry Producers Encouraged To Take Precautions Department of Agriculture | Date Posted: Wednesday, May 11, 2022 Listen DOVER, Del. (May 11, 2022)—Federal laboratory testing confirmed cases of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza (HPAI) in samples taken from black vultures initially found sick and dead on April 22 in Harford County, Maryland. Following an investigation by the Maryland Departments of Agriculture and Natural Resources (MDA, DNR) and the U.S Department of Agriculture (USDA) Wildlife Services, the USDA National Veterinary Services Laboratory confirmed samples submitted from the dead birds tested positive for HPAI. These detections mark the Delmarva region’s first confirmation of HPAI in wild birds since February 17, when the virus was found through wildlife surveillance in a Canada goose in Kent County, Delaware. HPAI is known to be carried by wild birds, especially waterfowl, raptors, and vultures. Avian influenza is a highly contagious airborne respiratory virus that spreads quickly among birds through nasal and eye secretions and manure. As scavengers, vultures will feed on dead wildlife, including other wild birds. If they ingest the virus, they can get sick and die. It is believed the vultures contracted the virus from eating infected migratory bird species. Even with the ongoing detections of HPAI in poultry and wild birds in the United States, continuing testing of people in close contact with infected poultry indicates a low risk to the general public’s health. This H5N1 virus has not shown an ability to infect and be transmitted between people. Avian influenza does not affect poultry meat or egg products, which remain safe to eat. Properly cooking poultry and eggs to 165 degrees Fahrenheit will kill viruses or bacteria. Since the initial detection in Harford County, more than 100 black vultures have died from the disease. A total count cannot be confirmed because wild birds often get sick and die where people cannot see them. Black vultures are also known to fly long distances, which means infected vultures may die in other locations and transmit the virus to other birds, including poultry. Six farms on Maryland’s Eastern Shore and Delaware were identified as impacted by HPAI between February 23 and March 18, 2022.

A new preprint reports the effectiveness of influenza vaccination in this light. Study: Effectiveness of influenza vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers in Qatar. Image Credit: BlurryMe/Shutterstock This news article was a review of a preliminary scientific report that had not undergone peer-review at the time of publication. Since its initial publication, the scientific report has now been peer reviewed and accepted for publication in a Scientific Journal. Links to the preliminary and peer-reviewed reports are available in the Sources section at the bottom of this article. View Sources Introduction The influenza vaccine is protective against the influenza virus, reducing the number of cases and deaths that occur with this seasonal pathogen. Flu shots are a high priority for older adults and healthcare workers (HCWs) at a greater risk of infection and complications. Earlier research suggests a link between SARS-CoV-2 infection/adverse COVID-19 outcomes and prior influenza vaccination. There was a need to make sure that this was not because flu shots are more likely to be taken by the health-conscious, who are also more compliant with protective health behaviors against COVID-19. This is called the healthy user effect and is a potential source of bias in such studies. The current study, which appears on the medRxiv* preprint server, was performed in Qatar, including over 30,000 healthcare workers vaccinated against influenza during the period between September 17, 2020, and December 31, 2020, when the annual flu shots are usually given. Significantly, this was before the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines. The vaccinated participants had a median age of 36 years, while a control group had a slightly lower median age of 35. All participants received the quadrivalent Influvac Tetra vaccine (Abbott). Cases and controls were in a ratio of 1:5. The subjects were tested for the virus by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test at a median of 1.5 months from vaccination. Of over 30,000 HCWs, over 12,000 were tested, with nearly 600 testing positive and 10,000 always tested negative. About two-thirds underwent testing because of COVID-19-like symptoms. What did the study show? The results showed that the flu shots reduced the risk of SARS-CoV-2 over the next two weeks by 30%. Conversely, they reduced the risk of severe or fatal COVID-19 by 90%. Of nearly 130 individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR after taking the flu shot, one developed severe COVID-19 (requiring hospitalization), and none progressed to critical or fatal disease. In contrast, among nearly 400 unvaccinated patients who tested positive, there were 17 severe and 2 critical cases, though no deaths occurred. Related StoriesSeasonal influenza adapted and evolved during the COVID-19 pandemicSARS-CoV-2 hijacks host proteins to escape immune clearanceCanada’s proactive policies reduce drug shortages far more effectively than the U.S.“Recent influenza vaccination is associated with an appreciable reduction in the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity.” Striking though this statement is, it must be noted that the study included small numbers of severe cases. Nonetheless, the evidence supports the reported effectiveness of the influenza vaccine against both infection with and COVID-19 disease as a result of SARS-CoV-2. The protection mechanism is as yet unexplained but could be due to a general rise in immunologic responsiveness enhancing nonspecific immunity or trained specific immunity. The former does not usually last beyond some weeks, and given that even specific COVID-19 vaccines are known to wane in efficacy quite rapidly, it may not play a long-term role in protection. Trained immunity is the response of the innate immune system, the first line of defense, whereby immune memory is formed to provide long-term protection against foreign antigens. Another effect could be due to bystander immunity, a process whereby infection and inflammation stimulate a prolonged response that exposes autoantigens to the host immune system. More importantly, the study is not generalizable because it includes mostly young, healthy HCWs. However, this negates the healthy user bias. Overall, therefore, “The findings support benefits for influenza vaccination that extend beyond protection against influenza infection and severe disease.” This news article was a review of a preliminary scientific report that had not undergone peer-review at the time of publication.

(May 11, 2022)—Federal laboratory testing confirmed cases of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza (HPAI) in samples taken from black vultures initially found sick and dead on April 22 in Harford County, Maryland. Following an investigation by the Maryland Departments of Agriculture and Natural Resources (MDA, DNR) and the U.S Department of Agriculture (USDA) Wildlife Services, the USDA National Veterinary Services Laboratory confirmed samples submitted from the dead birds tested positive for HPAI. These detections mark the Delmarva region’s first confirmation of HPAI in wild birds since February 17, when the virus was found through wildlife surveillance in a Canada goose in Kent County, Delaware.

A total count cannot be confirmed because wild birds often get sick and die where people cannot see them. Black vultures are also known to fly long distances, which means infected vultures may die in other locations and transmit the virus to other birds, including poultry. Six farms on Maryland’s Eastern Shore and Delaware were identified as impacted by HPAI between February 23 and March 18, 2022. With the first confirmation in a commercial poultry farm, a state-federal response was initiated between the Delaware Department of Agriculture (DDA), MDA, and USDA. Considering the ongoing detections in the black vulture population, all poultry owners need to continue with increased vigilance in protecting their flocks from contracting avian influenza. Follow these steps to help manage wildlife and keep avian influenza off your farm: Cover waste. Keep mortality and compost piles covered at all times. The recommendation is one part mortalities to two parts litter, with birds in layers no more than 5 inches deep and not placed next to sidewalls. Cover mortalities daily with litter. If vultures are still an issue, cover the bins with netting or a screen. Remove standing water adjacent to poultry houses. Grade property to avoid pooling water. Fill or grade areas where water stands for more than 48 hours after heavy rainfall. Don’t walk or move equipment through or near standing water – this could track wildlife fecal matter or other contaminants with the virus into your barns. Never use untreated surface water for watering birds, cleaning poultry barns, or other facilities. Manage ponds and basins on poultry farms. Prune or remove plants from banks of artificial water structures. Use wire grids, predator decoys, and scare devices to keep waterfowl away. Use fencing to separate natural ponds from the active area around barns. Secure buildings. Regularly check and repair damaged screens on windows and doors and holes in barn walls. Install netting or screens and use repellent gel or bird spikes to deter perching. Wash away or remove old nests before each nesting season. It is unlawful to remove nests with eggs or young birds in them. Reduce food sources. Don’t feed wildlife. Remove spilled or uneaten feed immediately and ensure feed storage units are secure and free of holes. Wild birds can carry HPAI. Use decoys. Install decoys and scare devices and move them often so wildlife doesn’t get used to them. If you have sick poultry or experience increased mortality in your flock: Commercial poultry producers should contact the company they grow for when they notice signs of disease. Backyard flock owners who notice any signs of HPAI in their flock should contact: In Delaware, email the Delaware Poultry Health Hotline at poultry.health@delaware.gov or call 302-698-4507 and provide your contact information, size of flock, location, and concerns. In Maryland, report any unusual or sudden increases in sick birds to the MDA Animal Health Program at 410-841-5810. Commercial chicken growers and backyard flock owners can email questions about the outbreak to Birdflu@maryland.gov. If you see sick or dead wild birds, do not handle or move them.

A total of 15,122 adult volunteers with a median age of 32 wore commercial sensors between Oct 1, 2018, and Jun 30, 2019, as part of their involvement with the Achievement application from Evidation Health, Inc., which tracks healthy habits, including minute-level steps.The participants were mostly White (86.9%) and female (86.7%), and almost all (99.3%) had at least a high school diploma.Every 2 weeks, the authors of the study had participants fill out a survey asking them to report any ILI in the previous 14 days. If participants reported symptoms, they were prompted to share specific details of symptoms, date of symptom onset, recovery date, healthcare-seeking behavior, diagnosis of ILI, lost workdays, household illness, and vaccination history days.For all ILI events reported, 18.8% participants sought medical attention, and 61 (0.4%) were hospitalized.From the first day of ILI symptoms through day 10, steps differences were notable and significant between sick and healthy participants, with a mean of 924 steps lost on the worst day of an ILI event. Over the course of the ILI (days 0 to 10), the mean cumulative loss was 4,437 steps, while steps did not change significantly during control periods.Using weighted modeling to approximate the US population, the authors concluded that a total of 255.2 billion steps were lost during ILI events in the United States during the study period."This finding reflects significant changes in routines, mobility, and employment and is equivalent to 15% of the active US population becoming completely immobilized for 1 day," they wrote.Age, education level affected activity levelRace and sex of participants did not affect activity levels as much as age and education levels, the authors found. Both older age and higher education level were correlated with more loss of daily steps, as were visiting a physician and missing work during the ILI period.Although the study was completed before the COVID-19 pandemic and before many people were able to work remotely, the authors said the findings are useful as America navigates a postpandemic world."The same approach could also be applied to quantifying the burden of other chronic diseases, including COVID-19 postviral syndrome (long COVID-19) or seasonal disorders," the authors concluded.

That pandemic was the deadliest disease outbreak of the last century, infecting a third of the world’s population and causing up to 100 million deaths. For comparison, the current covid-19 pandemic is thought to have resulted in 15 million deaths by the end of last year. Much about the 1918 pathogen is still mysterious: scientists only demonstrated that flu was caused by a virus in the 1930s, and few samples of the pandemic virus remain. Some of those we do have come from bodies buried in the Alaskan permafrost that remained frozen until they were dug up in the 1990s.Advertisement Now, more light has been shed by Thorsten Wolff at the Robert Koch Institute in Berlin, Germany, and his colleagues. The team genetically sequenced viruses from 13 lung samples stored in museums in Berlin and Vienna, Austria, that came from people who died from lung infections between 1901 and 1931. Three of the samples were from people who died in 1918, and two of these samples were collected before the pandemic peak in the final months of 1918. By comparing the viruses from the 1918 samples with modern-day seasonal flu viruses, Wolff’s team found that modern viruses could have descended from the 1918 virus. The researchers also compared the two samples of virus taken over the first few months of the 1918 pandemic with two previously sequenced pandemic viruses that had infected people later in 1918 as the pandemic peaked. They found there had been changes in a gene that encodes the nucleoprotein, a protein that surrounds the virus’s genetic material. Previous work on cells suggests these mutations could help the virus evade human immune system defences triggered by chemicals called interferons, which target the nucleoprotein. This suggests the virus evolved to better dodge the immune system, says Wolff. “We know that this was a really virulent virus,” he says. For the decade or so following the 1918 pandemic, deaths from flu reduced markedly, which could have been due to greater population immunity or the virus becoming less virulent, says Wolff.

Soon thereafter, HPAI cases were confirmed at commercial operations growing broilers (chickens grown for meat), turkeys, and egg-layers. Because HPAI can spread quickly, USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) depopulates flocks at operations where infections have been detected. Though the outbreak spread slowly in February, the number of HPAI cases increased rapidly in March, just ahead of Easter, when U.S. egg producers often expand their flocks to meet the demand for the upcoming holiday. As of May 2, HPAI outbreaks have been reported in 164 commercial poultry operations, including 18 egg-laying facilities. Commercial egg-laying hens represent a majority of the birds affected. On April 1, the U.S. table-egg layer flock was estimated at 305.2 million, reflecting, in part, the 16.9 million birds lost to HPAI in March 2022. APHIS reported that an additional 10.7 million layers were affected in April 2022. As of May 2, more than 29 million layers had been lost to HPAI. During the largest U.S. HPAI outbreak, in 2014–15, the industry lost 43 million egg layers. At the time the first major cases of the 2022 outbreak in commercial egg layers were confirmed, flock sizes were already smaller than in previous years, including their 2017–19 pre-pandemic levels.

"We're on the late side of things," said Dr. Carrie Horn, the chief medical officer at National Jewish Health in Denver. "But they're not so high that we're saying that there's a flu epidemic."It will be the first time since 1982 that such an increase has occurred so late in the typical flu season, said Lynnette Brammer, the head of the CDC's domestic influenza surveillance team. "We aren't used to thinking of flu in May, but it's definitely still out there," Brammer said, adding that it's possible rates could rise more this season.While this season has had far fewer cases than past seasons, the late-season uptick has brought positivity rates closer to where they would be at the end of a typical flu season.So far this season, the CDC reported, there have been at least 5.7 million cases of flu and an estimated 59,000 hospitalizations. About 3,600 people have died, including 24 children.Respiratory illnesses are spiking in New Mexico and Colorado in particular, according to the latest CDC flu data.Doctors there say patients are coming in with fever, cough, body aches — which could signal the flu, Covid-19 or a number of other respiratory viruses."Almost daily, I see at least one person with a case of something that we have to sort out," said Dr. Melissa Martinez, a professor of internal medicine at University of New Mexico Health Sciences. But it's indeed the flu that's proving to be behind a number of the current respiratory illnesses, Martinez said. Within the past few weeks, the proportion of positive Covid tests within the UNM Health Sciences system has hovered around 4 percent, she said, while the proportion of positive flu tests are up to 17 percent.The timing of flu cases is unusual, Martinez said. "To see an uptick in influenza this late in the season is really odd."Flu generally spreads through respiratory droplets when a person sneezes, coughs or even talks. The uptick has coincided as Covid-19 masking has largely fallen to a minimum nationwide. Despite the increases in flu cases, Martinez said, the overall number of influenza cases is low compared to previous seasons."It's a drop in the bucket compared to what we've seen in other years," she said.While the current season's test positivity rate hasn't exceeded 10 percent yet, previous seasons in the recent past peaked at upwards of 30 percent.The dominant strain this year has been H3N2, which experts say tends to be more virulent and often causes more severe illness.Because cases are peaking so late in the season, there is still time to get a flu shot, Brammer said, even though the vaccine is a less than ideal match for the current strain that's circulating. Testing to determine the cause of a respiratory illness — whether it's the flu or Covid — is critical, Martinez said. Antiviral treatments specific to both viruses are available, but they work best when they are given early on in the course of disease."We really want to start them on the correct treatment as soon as possible," she said.

The case was confirmed in a fox kit earlier this week, the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources said. Last week, two red fox kits from Ontario, Canada tested positive for HPAI. So far, HPAI has been confirmed in nearly 200 wild birds, including 19 species of birds and raptors in the state. Nationally, the highly contagious virus has culled 37 million chickens and turkeys in U.S. farms since February. It's also having an alarming effect on bald eagles, causing them to feel unsteady on their talons and render them unable to fly. This year's strain is more aggressive than the previous 2015 strain, the Minnesota DNR says. "Wild animals can sometimes transmit diseases to humans, and while we typically think of rabies or other well-known diseases as the primary concerns, this shows that there are other risks to keep in mind as well," said Dr. Joni Scheftel, state public health veterinarian with the Minnesota Department of Health. "The best advice we have for Minnesotans is to avoid contact with wildlife that appear to be sick or injured." Minnesotans who find sick or dead birds or raptors should contact the DNR.

They sell newly-hatched poultry and waterfowl to commercial operations and people with flocks in their backyards or hobby farms.Abendroth said the outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza in the state this spring has divided their customers into two camps.“Either a person’s really skeptical about getting new birds because they’re afraid of it, and other people are like, they don’t even believe it exists,” he said.

As of Friday, there have been 16 confirmed cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza in the state this year according to the state Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection. Ten of those cases have been non-commercial owners, from a backyard flock of 15 birds in Sheboygan County to 222 birds in Oconto County.It’s a much higher number of non-commercial cases than in 2015 when the state experienced its last outbreak of the highly contagious virus. That year there were only 10 cases of avian flu, which included one backyard flock.State Veterinarian Dr. Darlene Konkle said there are several factors that could influence why more small flock owners have been affected this year. The virus itself is a different strain than what was seen in 2015, but she said both strains spread quickly and cause birds to die quickly. Konkle said officials have seen more detections of the flu in wild bird populations this year, which is likely how the disease is spreading around the state.“With potentially more virus out there in the environment this time and a late spring kind of delaying the warm-up and the drying out of the environment, we just may be having a little bit more opportunity for that virus to get into different flocks,” she said.Konkle said officials hope backyard flock owners are also more aware of the threat of avian flu and what signs to look for that indicate an outbreak. She said DATCP has tried to educate poultry owners and encourage them to report possible cases.Rick Abendroth also thinks there’s more awareness about the presence of avian flu than there was back in 2015, in part because news of outbreaks at large commercial facilities is more available.“Back then, there was a lot of cases that nobody knew about,” Abendroth said. “When someone broke out, no one wanted to talk about it because they didn’t want that associated with them. And now information is so easily transmitted, that it doesn’t matter. If you want it or not, they’re going to find out.”Abendroth said his family’s hatchery already had biosecurity measures in place before the first case of avian flu showed up in Wisconsin in March. They stopped allowing in-person pick up of birds at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and have continued to restrict who can enter their facility.He said the outbreak of the virus this year hasn’t affected the number of birds they expect to sell. For customers that are nervous, Abendroth said he’s spent more time answering their questions over the phone, but most still buy new birds to add to their flocks. And he’s hopeful the worst of this year’s outbreak has passed.“I feel like we’re past the tipping point because it is warming up. Those birds are migrating that are carrying it, they are leaving. So it’s going to become less and less throughout the year,” he said.Konkle is also hopeful the end of the annual waterfowl migration will bring an end to new infections in the state and DATCP will be able to end its ban on poultry fairs, exhibitions and swaps that’s currently in place until the end of May. “We’re hoping that by the time fair season, the exhibition season really gets going more towards this summer in June and July that we’ll be able to have those again. But we’ll have to continue to reevaluate as we’re still going through this outbreak,” she said.DATCP recommends that poultry owners continue to follow prevention measures like handwashing, disinfecting equipment and restricting access to their birds. Officials also recommend that new birds are separated from existing flocks for at least 30 days and all birds should be kept indoors if possible.

The fox kits, collected between April 1 and April 14, came from three separate dens in Lapeer, Macomb and St. Clair counties. The DNR had received a report from a wildlife rehabilitator in southeastern Michigan about the fox kits exhibiting neurologic signs of HPAI before death. The kits were observed circling, tremoring and seizing. Two of the three died within hours of intake, while one appeared to respond to supportive therapy but then died in care. Interestingly, an additional kit that was a sibling of the Macomb County kit did survive, but developed blindness, making her non-releasable. This kit will be housed at a local nature center. Highly pathogenic avian influenza is a virus known to affect birds throughout North America, with detections in backyard flocks and commercial poultry facilities, to date, in 34 states and detections in wild birds in 35 states. HPAI is highly contagious and poultry are especially vulnerable. In addition, this viral strain also affects waterfowl, raptors and scavengers (like turkey vultures, eagles and crows). In Michigan, HPAI has been confirmed in 69 wild birds, with the outbreak continuing to spread throughout North America. Follow the current status of HPAI in Michigan at Michigan.gov/BirdFlu and Avian influenza updates (Michigan.gov). The three fox kits were sampled for HPAI at the DNR Wildlife Disease Lab and submitted to the Michigan State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory for testing. All three kits tested “non-negative” (presumptive positive) on May 6 and were confirmed positive by the National Veterinary Services Lab in Ames, Iowa, on May 11. The virus was detected in swabs collected from the nose, mouth, throat and brain tissue of all three kits, and a full postmortem examination was conducted to aid in learning more about this disease in foxes. The DNR Wildlife Division continues to collaborate with many partners within the state and across agencies to share findings. HPAI in red foxes outside Michigan These cases in Michigan are not the first confirmed detections of HPAI in red foxes: A recent article in Emerging Infectious Diseases demonstrated H5N1 virus detection in wild red fox kits at a rehabilitation center in the Netherlands in May 2021, during an outbreak of HPAI in wild birds. In North America, the first report of HPAI H5N1 in wild mammals occurred in Canada May 2, 2022, when two wild fox kits in Ontario tested positive for the virus. One of the kits was found dead and the other displayed severe neurologic signs before dying at a rehabilitation center. Virus was detected in brain tissue, and sequencing results indicate that it is the same strain of HPAI found in the current North American outbreak (H5N1 A/goose/Guangdong/1996 (Gs/GD) lineage). The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources on Wednesday reported that state’s first confirmed case of HPAI in a wild mammal, a wild fox kit from Anoka County. “HPAI H5N1 viruses may occasionally transmit from birds to mammals, as occurred in these cases, and there may be additional detections in other mammals during this outbreak, but they likely will be isolated cases,” said Megan Moriarty, the state wildlife veterinarian with the DNR. “At this point, it is unclear how the fox kits became infected, but it’s possible that they were exposed by consuming infected birds, such as waterfowl.” Reporting sick or dead wildlife Anyone who notices what appears to be unusual or unexplained deaths among wild birds or sick, dead or neurologically abnormal foxes is asked to report the information by: Calling the DNR Wildlife Disease Laboratory at 517-336-5030. Calling a local DNR field office to speak to a field biologist. Using the DNR’s Eyes in the Field app. Choose the “diseased wildlife” reporting option. Moriarty encouraged the public to continue sharing such wildlife observations, even though the DNR will be unable to respond to every person submitting a report. “We greatly appreciate the effort to report instances of animals that are sick or appear to have unusual or unexplained deaths, because those tips often lead to important information,” said Moriarty. “Every bird or animal reported may not be tested for HPAI, but all observations are important.” Highly pathogenic avian influenza primarily affects birds, but it is important to remember that it can be a zoonotic disease (one that has the potential to be transmitted from domestic or wild animals to humans). According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the public health risk associated with HPAI remains low, but advises people to avoid handling any sick or dead wild birds. If it is necessary to move a dead bird, use a plastic bag or shovel to do so and thoroughly wash your hands afterward. HPAI in domestic flocks Highly pathogenic avian influenza is highly contagious and can be spread to domestic flocks by wild birds, through contact with infected poultry, by equipment, and on the clothing and shoes of caretakers. Make sure domestic poultry (e.g., chickens, turkeys, geese and ducks raised for the production of meat or eggs) is separate from and has no contact with wild birds. The Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development stated that no birds or bird products infected with HPAI will enter the food chain. As a reminder, all poultry and eggs should be handled and cooked properly, with a safe cooking temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit. Domestic bird owners and caretakers should watch for unusual deaths, a drop in egg production, a significant decrease in water consumption or an increase in sick birds. If avian influenza is suspected, immediately contact MDARD at 800-292-3939 (daytime) or 517-373-0440 (after hours).

Therefore, it makes sense to take udder wipes for diagnostics as even suckling piglets can shed the virus. - Photo: Ronald HissinkThe first episode in this two-part series showed that influenza viruses are circulating in a large proportion of the pig herd in Europe. This article describes how pig vaccination could help avert the next global influenza pandemic.While sows make up only about 10% of the total pig population on-farm, their non-vaccinated offspring represent a vulnerable group of animals that can keep virus circulating. Maternally derived antibodies that piglets receive from their vaccinated mothers are able to protect piglets from clinical signs, but infection still occurs. Vaccination strategies implemented on-farm should therefore also include piglets and fatteners: not only can they be a source of reassortment, but infection also causes huge economic impact due to reduced daily weight gain and increased use of medication.Trials have shown that vaccination is effective in preventing clinical disease from all the circulating swine flu strains. However, to protect against most lineages of influenza A circulating in pigs in Europe, a combination of two vaccines – a trivalent covering H1N1, H1N2 and H3N2 and a vaccine with H1N1 pandemic strain – is required.While it is true that vaccines cannot totally eliminate virus, they prevent clinical disease and significantly reduce the amount of virus in circulation, thereby reducing the opportunity for viruses to mix, exchange genetic material and emerge as new, potentially pandemic strains. Vaccines against swine flu for pigs are much more effective in preventing clinical disease than flu vaccines used in people. It is therefore ironic that the widespread use of the vaccines in people is widely accepted, while the use of much more effective vaccines in pigs is sometimes questioned.Increasing efficacy of flu vaccinesSeveral strategies can be used to further increase the efficacy of swine flu vaccines used in pigs. All pig vaccines against swine flu licensed in Europe include the use of adjuvants in the vaccine composition. Adjuvants are certain types of chemicals that specifically stimulate the immune system and may potentiate vaccine efficacy.The disadvantage of adjuvants is that they may cause more local reactions, such as swelling at the site of injection, and also short-lived systemic reactions, such as fever or pain. For that reason, adjuvants are not often used in most human flu vaccines. Only in exceptional cases, an adjuvant could be used because immune responses of older people are generally weaker than those of younger people.Most influenza vaccines for use in people contain small fragments of virus particles from a number of different strains. Trivalent or, increasingly, tetravalent vaccines, containing viral particles from three or four different strains, are most commonly used throughout the world. In contrast, pig vaccines are made from whole, inactivated viruses: Ceva’s RespiporcFLU3 vaccine contains whole inactivated viruses of three strains of swine flu virus which between them cover three of the four major lineages of influenza A virus; ResiporcFLUpanH1N1 contains whole inactivated virus from a strain originally isolated from a human case of influenza. So, while the human vaccines mostly contain just the viral proteins that are the major determinants that induce protective immunity, the pig vaccines contain the full range of viral structural proteins. Some of those additional proteins may also induce immunity and thereby boost the efficacy of the vaccines, and may also provide broader protection against a wider range of strains.New seasonal flu vaccinesEach year, new seasonal flu vaccines are produced for people which are designed to closely match the influenza strains circulating that year. The regulatory authorities allow human vaccine manufacturers to replace the stains included in annual flu vaccines based on the recommended strains, providing certain standard procedures are followed. Current regulations controlling the use of veterinary vaccines in Europe preclude that option: changing the strains used in the currently licensed pig vaccines would necessitate a mandatory and lengthy approval process which would be impractical and uneconomic for vaccine manufacturers.As noted previously, pigs can become infected with swine flu strains from other pigs, birds and people. Of those, people are likely to be the major source of infection: although the disease is called “swine flu”, from a pig’s perspective it would actually be human flu. For that reason, pig farmers and other people who come into contact with pigs should be encouraged to have their annual flu vaccination.In addition to vaccination of pigs and people, adoption of effective biosecurity measures can help to prevent virus circulation between pigs and also reduce the incidence of secondary bacterial infections, as the influenza virus and other pathogens can adhere to any surface and be transmitted by both inanimate and animate vectors. Measures include:All-in, all-out rearing systems for piglets;Deep cleans between batches;Avoiding crossing walkways;Clothes and shoe changing when staff move between production stages;Colour-coded equipment for individual areas.Changing attitudes post-CovidCovid-19 has very clearly demonstrated the enormous economic and human cost associated with a global pandemic of a respiratory virus. The global population of pigs has grown steadily over the past decades, from around 400 million in the early 1960s to close to one billion today. At the same time, the average size of pig farms has also increased. Throughout the world, small, backyard pig production has given way to large, commercial pig units.Whereas in the 1990s a large pig farm would have 200 breeding sows, now many farms have thousands or even tens of thousands of sows. These changes in the way pigs are reared, combined with the fact that pigs serve as very efficient hosts for influenza viruses from pigs, birds and people to mix and swap genetic material, make it increasingly likely that the next global influenza pandemic will arise in pigs.Animals vaccinated with the trivalent vaccine have shown reduced shedding and reduced clinical signs after infection with an H1N1 virus that emerged in 2010. That was shown by a team of researchers led by Álvaro López-Valiñas, attached to the Catalan research institute CReSA-IRTA in 2021. Even more important was the finding that vaccinated animals reduced the probability of the production of new reassortants. The authors stated: “Stricter vaccination schedules should be carried out on farms to avoid maximum SIV [swine influenza viruses] circulation, increasing the current percentage of swine population vaccinated against SIV in Europe (10–20%).”Reducing disease and boosting productivityMass vaccination of sows and their offspring against swine flu would deliver direct benefits to pig farmers – reducing disease and boosting productivity in ways that are highly cost-effective. If such a strategy could also avert the next global pandemic, the return on investment would be incalculable, not to mention the human suffering prevented and lives saved.Now, therefore, appears to be a very good time to make vets, pig farmers and public health authorities aware of the potential benefits of vaccinating pig herds. The big question that still needs answering, however – as is the case with all diseases that can spread from animals to people – is who pays and who benefits? It is to be hoped that the world’s public health and veterinary authorities can answer that question before the next global pandemic strikes.By Kathrin Lillie-Jaschniski, DVM, PhD, and Friederike Schmelz, DVM, PhD, Ceva Santé AnimaleThe previous article in this series was published in Pig Progress 38.02.

In New South Wales, they have doubled in a week: the state reported 2,000 cases in the week to 7 May, compared with 1,024 the week before.The latest data from the FluTracking surveillance network – which monitors for respiratory symptoms each week in more than 60,000 volunteers across Australia – found that respiratory illness levels are trending upwards, particularly in children aged 17 and under.The network asks participants to log symptoms including fever, cough, sore throat, headache and runny nose, and tracks the proportion of symptomatic people who test positive for Covid or influenza.Flu predicted to roar back during Australia’s winter after two-year reprieveRead moreOf people who were symptomatic in the week to 8 May, more than half tested positive for Covid.“We think that the second Omicron wave has peaked,” says the FluTracking creator Craig Dalton, a conjoint associate professor at the University of Newcastle.Dalton says there has been a rapid rise in influenza cases in children under five. “Some of them would not have seen flu at all in their lives.“This is a common occurrence in infectious diseases where there is some immune protection … that comes with age – that you had time to encounter a range of different diseases and develop immunity.”Flu cases in people over 65 were “sitting pretty flat”, Dalton says. “That could be a combination of [high] vaccination in the elderly, and prior immune response.”In addition to influenza, there’s also transmission of rhinovirus – the common cold virus. “It hasn’t taken off. In fact, it was higher about a month ago, but it’s still there,” Dalton says. “About about one in four to one in three people who are tested for the common cold virus are positive at the moment.”How bad will the flu season be?“The biggest reason to have a big flu year is a change in the actual virus,” Dalton says. “It’s too early to say at this stage.”The last pre-pandemic flu season in Australia, in 2019, saw 313,033 laboratory-confirmed cases and 953 deaths.“This year is going to look really bad because of the increased testing,” Dalton says. “Lots of people who go and get a Covid test at a drive-through [clinic] will also now be getting a flu test. That increased testing will lead to a massive increase in detection of flu.”Experts will then need to look at the proportion of flu tests that come back positive to determine whether higher figures are just due to increased testing, or if flu activity is truly higher compared with previous years.How common is ‘flurona’?“Flurona” refers to infection with both Covid and influenza at the same time and does not mean the viruses have merged. Co-infection is possible but uncommon – it affects an estimated less than 1% of people with Covid in the general population.Nigel Stocks, a professor of general practice at the University of Adelaide, previously told Guardian Australia that the risk of co-infection with two viruses existed prior to the pandemic.“In the past it was influenza and respiratory syncytial virus or rhinovirus,” Stocks said. “Some unlucky people can be infected with both [influenza] A and B at the same time, but that’s very unusual.”Australia Weekend signupCo-infection with both Covid and the flu can increase the severity of symptoms. One study of more than 212,000 people in the UK of people admitted to hospital for Covid found that those co-infected with influenza had four times greater odds of being put on mechanical ventilation, and twice the odds of dying in hospital.Flu shots free for high-risk groupsExperts have been warning for weeks against complacency around influenza vaccines this winter.Influenza vaccine coverage in Australia dropped last year compared with 2020. According to an Atagi statement published in December, there was an estimated 20% reduction in flu vaccination uptake in young people aged five to 14.Influenza vaccinations are free for groups at highest risk, including children aged six months to five years, and people who are over 65, pregnant or have chronic health conditions.Quick GuideHow to get the latest news from Guardian AustraliaShow Email: sign up for our daily morning and afternoon email newslettersApp: download our free app and never miss the biggest storiesSocial: follow us on YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Facebook or TwitterPodcast: listen to our daily episodes on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or search "Full Story" in your favourite appPhotograph: Tim Robberts/Stone RFWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The flu shot and Covid-19 booster can be administered on the same day.“My recommendation is that you get each vaccine in a separate arm, so if you do get a sore arm you know which vaccine has caused that particular side-effect,” Australia’s deputy chief medical officer, Prof Michael Kidd, said last month.“If you have had a particularly rough time after one of your Covid-19 vaccines or after a previous influenza vaccine, you may choose to space out getting the vaccines.”Explore more on these topicsHealthCoronavirusInfectious diseasesexplainersShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveTax strategyFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInXNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

But once drivers unload and are ready to leave the farm, they should shut their trailers’ front vents, lower side curtains, or put boards in place. “As much as possible, we want to keep debris from blowing off those trailers until you’re able to get to the closest truck wash,” Brightbill said.Twelve premises with about 4 million birds have been depopulated because of avian influenza in Pennsylvania, according to USDA.Eight farms are in Lancaster County, four in Berks County. Egg layer, duck and broiler houses have been affected.All but one of the infected farms have finished disposal, and each of the completed farms has composted the birds, Brightbill said.Avian influenza cases peaked nationally in early April and have since been falling gradually. The risk should decline as warm, sunny weather arrives and wild birds finish migrating at the end of the month.“We’re not out of the woods yet, but we’re certainly making dramatic progress,” Brightbill said.Participants have indicated that Pennsylvania’s avian influenza response has been a good collaboration between the state, USDA, academia and industry, but the past month hasn’t been easy for those involved.Brightbill said many staff have worked 28 days straight for up to 16 hours a day.“We will continue to work hard to ensure the future of the industry, our farms and our families, are protected,” he said.In Pennsylvania, sick or dead captive birds, whether commercial or backyard fowl, should be reported to the Department of Agriculture at 717-772-2852.Lancaster Farming offers a printable one-page handout with biosecurity recommendations, avian influenza symptoms and numbers to call for reporting a suspected outbreak.

It could. And the manufacturer isn’t required to tell you. BySusan Thixton Published May 10, 2022 The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) is reporting that 34 US states have seen outbreaks of avian flu in poultry flocks. Since this outbreak began in January 2022 (as of May 9, 2022) more than 37 million birds in the US have been killed (termed as depopulated) due to the virus. The big questions for pet owners: how are those millions of poultry carcasses disposed of? Will they end up in pet food? The USDA has a document specific to the depopulation of avian flu poultry and the disposal of those birds. The USDA allows avian flu poultry to be disposed of by “composting, burial, incineration, rendering, and landfilling“, and states that “depending on the situation” all of the available disposal options will be used. This means—with certainty—some of the depopulated avian influenza poultry will end up as rendered ingredients in pet food. The USDA document explains the rendering depopulation method as: “This involves processing carcasses until they are reduced to water, fat or tallow, and meat or bone meal.” This tells us that the avian flu depopulated poultry will become the commonly used pet food ingredients chicken meal, turkey meal, chicken by-product meal, turkey by-product meal, and chicken fat. The FDA does NOT require pet food manufacturers to disclose if any ingredient was sourced from avian flu depopulated poultry. Could rendered ingredients be contaminated with avian flu? Absolutely yes. The goal of any heat step such as rendering is to destroy all pathogens. As many pathogenic bacteria pet food recalls evidence, pathogens often survive the rendering of ingredients and/or the pet food cooking process. Specific to avian flu and rendered ingredients, the USDA states rendering sick birds “is very effective but requires added safety precautions to make sure the virus does not become aerosolized and dispersed throughout the rendering plant.” One mistake, one lax safety precaution could result in the virus being spread to millions/billions of pounds of rendered ingredients. Dogs and cats are susceptible to avian influenza, however cats appear to be more susceptible. The New York Health Department stated: “In 2016, over 100 cats and one person in NYC tested positive for a low pathogenic avian influenza known as H7N2.” The current outbreak of avian influenza is considered “highly pathogenic“. The other issue of concern is how avian flu infected flocks of poultry are depopulated, and would depopulation methods be a risk in rendered ingredients? The USDA document (linked above) states that the common methods “to depopulate HPAI-affected flocks: water-based foam for floor-raised birds and carbon dioxide gas for caged birds.” No authority (FDA or USDA) provides assurances to pet owners that foam killed or carbon dioxide killed flu infected birds are safe for pets to consume. Pet owners are caught in the middle of government agency jurisdiction. The USDA has jurisdiction over the depopulation methods, the sick birds and the rendering facilities that would process the sick poultry. But the USDA has no jurisdiction over the pet food ingredients that are produced by the rendering process. All pet food ingredients fall into FDA jurisdiction. In other words, the risk to pets consuming depopulated avian flu infected poultry is not considered by USDA. USDA can decide how best to depopulate 37+ million of poultry giving (hopefully) some respect to end of life for the poultry—but they make those decisions without one concern to the pet edible product (allowed by FDA) produced through depopulation. On the other side of things, the FDA allows these ingredients to be used in pet food with no regulatory ‘say’ in safe for pets to consume methods for depopulation. Are these ingredients safe? We don’t know. But we do know that no authority is providing pet owners with assurances that the sick birds or the depopulation methods result in safe for pets to consume ingredients. We have sent questions to FDA Center for Veterinary Medicine asking if FDA has directly allowed rendered depopulated avian flu birds into pet food and we asked if FDA believes pet owners should be informed what they are purchasing (with a disclosure on the label). We don’t expect to hear back from FDA CVM anytime soon, it often takes months for them to respond to our questions. Waste—such as the rendered carcasses of foam or carbon dioxide depopulated avian flu infected poultry, 37 million carcasses—is an ugly truth of pet food. An ugly truth that no one of authority wants to talk about. But…it HAS TO BE publicly discussed and disclosed on pet food labels (if they are going to continue to allow waste to be disposed of into pet food). To keep this ugly truth silent, is deceiving millions of pet owners and potentially putting millions of pets at risk. Please send a message to FDA Center for Veterinary Medicine, asking them if they are allowing rendered avian flu infected depopulated poultry to be processed into pet food. Ask them for FDA assurance that the sick birds and the depopulation methods used are safe for pets to consume. Ask them to issue a public statement alerting pet owners that depopulated avian flu infected poultry are being processed into pet food, and to publicly provide scientific evidence these rendered ingredients are safe for pets to consume. Email FDA CVM at: AskCVM@fda.hhs.gov. If your pet’s food or treat contains the ingredients chicken meal, turkey meal, chicken by-product meal, turkey by-product meal, poultry fat or chicken fat – ask the manufacturer for a written guarantee the ingredient is not sourced from avian flu depopulated poultry.

However the majority of pathogenic bacteria pet food recalls over the past ten years have been in cooked pet foods. Stating “zero danger” is not accurate. Reply Kathy May 10, 2022 at 6:56 pm Even if your statement was correct, all pet food isn’t cooked. I for one feed raw, so saying there’s “zero danger to any pet dog or cat at all” isn’t true.

Your shared research permits us to make educated choices for our families – thank you for helping us to feed properly with peace of mind Susan! Reply Margo May 10, 2022 at 4:36 pm A major poultry operation that kills thousands upon thousands of birds in hours will take DAYS to remove the dead birds from their huge barns. Especially during warm and hot days these birds are going to decompose long before they reach a rendering plant. Since a single “positive” PCR test, the same test the FDA removed from the market for human covid testing, is enough “proof”, I see the actual virus as a fairly small threat when compared to the chemicals used to kill the birds and most likely advanced decomposition and probably massive contamination with fecal matter and soiled barn bedding. Reply Susan Thixton May 10, 2022 at 5:20 pm I agree with you Margo. While a pet could acquire the virus, the risks from depopulation are much greater. Reply Audree Berg May 10, 2022 at 8:02 pm Two questions – If cooking kills the pathogens (let’s say for argument’s sake that it does), will the virus potentially be present in raw or gently cooked diets? Is there a list of manufacturer’s that confirm that they test for AF in their testing protocols. Thanks Susan (and the TAPF community) Reply Lise Petroski June 3, 2022 at 7:57 am Thanks Susan.

On Wednesday, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) confirmed that a small poultry flock in the Comox Valley tested positive for the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus. “The infected premises has been placed under quarantine by the CFIA, and BC’s Ministry of Agriculture and Food has notified producers within a 12-kilometre radius about the positive test results,” the CFIA said. That brings the total number of small or backyard flocks in BC to contract the virus up to seven, presumably through contact with infected wild migrating birds. Since April, flocks have tested positive for avian influenza in Kelowna, Richmond, Armstrong and the central Kootenays. It’s prompting officials to enact an order requiring commercial poultry producers with 100 or more birds to keep them indoors until June 13th. Small or backyard flock owners are urged to stay vigilant and have appropriate preventative measures in place, including reducing human access to flocks and increasing cleaning, disinfection and sanitization. The CFIA says avian flu is a federally regulated disease and notes its team is leading the investigation and response with provincial support for testing, mapping, surveillance and disposal. “Wild birds have also tested positive for H5 strains of avian influenza in or near 100 Mile House, Bowen Island, Chilliwack, Kelowna, Metro Vancouver, Vanderhoof and Williams Lake,” the CFIA added. Sick or dead wild bird sightings can be reported to the Wild Bird Mortality Investigation Program toll-free hotline at 1 (866) 431-2473.

It's estimated that between 20 per cent and 40 per cent of the entire world's population became sick. (Alamy)Scientists analysed 13 lung specimens collected from different people between 1901 and 1931 and carefully stored in historical archives of museums in Germany and Austria.The century-old specimens included six samples taken from Spanish Flu victims in 1918 and 1919, during the peak of the killer pandemic.In the peer-reviewed study published on Wednesday in Nature Communications, researchers conducted molecular clock modelling, a method which allows evolutionary timescales to be estimated, and suggested that all genomic segments of the seasonal H1N1 flu could be directly descended from the initial 1918 pandemic strain.This finding, scientists said, contradicted earlier thinking that H1N1 emerged through a process of reassortment, a phenomenon which involves the exchange of genomic segments between different viruses.READ MORE: Soaring cost of meat and vegies predicted to continueScientists analysed 13 lung specimens stored in German and Austrian museums, including six samples collected in 1918 and 1919 during the peak of the Spanish Flu pandemic.
