Her memories form part of a collection published by South African historian Howard Phillips on the centenary of that disaster. It’s not the only one. Another collection published around the same time by New Zealand historian Geoffrey Rice is also littered with references to long-term symptoms of that flu—from “loss of muscular energy” to “nervous complications.” Some convalescents, recalled a Dr. Jamieson who worked at a hospital in Nelson, on New Zealand’s South Island, “passed through a period of apathy and depression,” or experienced tremor, restlessness, or sleeplessness.What’s striking about reading these accounts ten months into a new pandemic, is the historical echo they provide of “Long Covid”—that mysterious affliction, or afflictions, that dogs some patients who were infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus long after any initial symptoms have subsided, and apparently long after the virus has left their body. “Day 163 post Covid,” tweeted one Long Covid sufferer on Sept. 16. “I managed to walk for 20 mins without chest pain while keeping my heart rate below 120.”One definition of Long Covid is “not recovering [for] several weeks or months following the start of symptoms that were suggestive of Covid, whether you were tested or not.” It’s an unavoidably woolly definition, until research elucidates the various post-COVID-19 syndromes that Long Covid almost certainly comprises. But in the meantime, it does the job of giving sufferers a label, so that they are more likely to be taken seriously and treated—to the extent that medicine has any treatment to offer them—and which recognises that the the virus can cause chronic symptoms that are distinct from the indirect impact on health of the pandemic’s social or economic fallout.Research into Long Covid is getting underway—belatedly, because some sufferers were never hospitalized, not having experienced the severe respiratory symptoms that can characterise the acute disease—but for now there are more questions about it than answers. Nobody knows what proportion of those infected with the virus experience lingering symptoms, for example, and the bewildering diversity of those symptoms is only now becoming apparent. Profound fatigue is probably the most common, but others include breathlessness, aches, palpitations, rashes, and pins and needles. No tissue or organ seems to be spared—something that comes as no surprise to Debby van Riel.A virologist at Erasmus University in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, van Riel has spent years studying how flu causes ravages beyond the respiratory tract. She has done so in human cells grown in a dish, in animal models and in patients—trying to capture, from the different angles these offer, the complex cascade of biochemical events that infection with various subtypes of the influenza A virus sets off in the body’s tissues.Her subjects have included H5N1, the aggressive “bird” flu that—until last year—was considered a leading candidate for the cause of the next pandemic, the H1N1 “swine” flu that caused the most recent flu pandemic, in 2009, and the mother of them all, the virus that caused the so-called “Spanish” flu pandemic of 1918. Earlier this year, van Riel switched her attention to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and saw that—though it behaves differently from flu—it too has effects far beyond the respiratory tract. “At least in its severe form, we should consider COVID-19 a systemic disease,” she says—something that is also true of flu.Given these similarities, perhaps history can offer us some insights into what to expect from Long Covid. “The incapacity caused by the flu and its after-effects seriously affected the country’s economy for some time,” wrote Phillips in 1990, in Black October, his comprehensive study of the 1918 epidemic in South Africa. In what is now Tanzania, to the north, post-viral syndrome has been blamed for triggering the worst famine in a century—the so-called “famine of corms”—after debilitating lethargy prevented flu survivors from planting when the rains came at the end of 1918. “Agriculture suffered particular disruption because, not only did the epidemic coincide with the planting season in some parts of the country, but in others it came at the time for harvesting and sheep-shearing.” Kathleen Brant, who lived on a farm in Taranaki, New Zealand, told Rice, the historian, about the “legion” problems farmers in her district encountered following the pandemic, even though all patients survived: “The effects of loss of production were felt for a long time.”A century ago, a greater proportion of the world’s economy was derived from agriculture, but it wasn’t only agriculture that was affected. Phillips recounts the case of a train driver who was involved in an accident in 1919 who later explained that he suffered a blackout while at the controls: “He claimed that this was the after-effect of an attack of Spanish flu the previous year, which had left him ‘never… quite the same since.’” Similar reports came from all over the world. British doctors noted that cases of nervous disorders including “melancholia”—what we would call depression—showed a marked increase in 1919 and 1920. Schoolteachers lamented that it would take their pupils months or years to recover lost ground.The trouble with discussing the 1918 pandemic is that it overlapped with World War I, making it difficult if not impossible to determine the relative contributions of the two disasters to any subsequent wave of lethargy or mental illness (the pandemic – like today’s – might also have had indirect effects on health, due to the bereavement and social upheaval it brought in its wake). Studies from countries that were neutral in the war, such as Norway, are therefore invaluable, since they afford a glimpse of the impact of the pandemic that is uncomplicated by that of the war. Norwegian demographer Svenn-Erik Mamelund provided such evidence when he combed the records of psychiatric institutions in his country to show that the average number of admissions showed a seven-fold increase in each of the six years following the pandemic, compared to earlier, non-pandemic years.As precious as such findings are, we need to be cautious in interpreting them. For one thing, there’s no way of demonstrating, retrospectively, a causal link between the flu and the psychiatric illnesses those patients were suffering from. For another, the taboos around mental illness, as strong if not stronger then than now, mean the numbers may not accurately reflect the extent of the phenomenon. Although it’s almost impossible to gauge how common “Long Flu” was in the years after 1918, the working assumption is that it affected only a small proportion of survivors—and this is also the working assumption regarding Long Covid, on the basis of still-sketchy data.Nevertheless, given the tens of millions who have already been infected by SARS-CoV-2, even a small minority could amount to substantial misery, not to mention social and economic fallout—as it did 100 years ago. That’s reason enough, says psychiatrist Simon Wessely of King’s College London, “to investigate the Long Covid cases with the same rigour and vigour that studies like PHOSP-COVID are investigating the hospitalised cases.”More Must-Reads from TIMEHow Donald Trump WonThe Best Inventions of 2024Why Sleep Is the Key to Living LongerRobert Zemeckis Just Wants to Move YouHow to Break 8 Toxic Communication HabitsNicola Coughlan Bet on Herself—And WonWhy Vinegar Is So Good for YouMeet TIME's Newest Class of Next Generation LeadersContact us at letters@time.comTIME Ideas hosts the world's leading voices, providing commentary on events in news, society, and culture.

Totten A Tidal Wave of Death The 1918 Spanish flu was a killer of historic proportions. / Health Care, Health Care December 30, 2020 / Share / From the Magazine / Health Care, Health Care Autumn 2020 / Share In 1918 and 1919, the novel H1N1 “Spanish flu” virus killed between 50 million and 100 million people—as much as 5 percent of the world’s population—mostly within a few months, making the contemporaneous mass murder of World War I look like a bagatelle. The pandemic was, Laura Spinney writes in her book Pale Rider: The Spanish Flu of 1918 and How It Changed the World, “the greatest tidal wave of death since the Black Death, perhaps in the whole of human history.” No one knows for sure where it started. There was no ground zero, no “Wuhan.” It may have begun in Europe or in East Asia, but the first confirmed cases appeared in rural Haskell County, Kansas, with the first large and verified outbreak erupting at an army base there. Soldiers traveling to World War I battlefields then spread it to Europe; and from there, it encircled the globe. The H1N1 virus of 1918 was roughly 25 times more lethal than the seasonal flu and also more deadly than the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus that causes Covid-19, especially as the latter’s mortality rate is declining now that we’re better able to treat it. It killed an estimated 2.5 percent of its victims. Life expectancy in the United States plunged by more than ten years. This was partly due to the flu itself—at its peak, it killed more people than everything else combined—and partly because it knocked hospitals out of commission almost everywhere, preventing doctors and nurses from treating much else. “They called the plague of 1918 influenza,” Gina Kolata writes in her book Flu: The Story of the Great Influenza Pandemic of 1918 and the Search for the Virus That Caused It, “but it was like no influenza ever seen before. It was more like a biblical prophecy come true, something from Revelations that predicted that first the world was to be struck by war, then famine, and then, with the breaking of the fourth seal of the scroll foretelling the future, the appearance of a horse, ‘deathly pale, and its rider was called Plague, and Hades followed at its heels.’ ” Coronaviruses emerge from bats, flu viruses from birds. Bats and birds have adapted to these viruses so perfectly that they don’t even get sick when they carry them. The overwhelming majority of the millions of viruses that infect animals around the world have no effect on humans. Before a zoonotic virus can infect a person, it must transform itself either through mutation or, more likely, through genetic recombination that becomes possible when it first jumps to an intermediate species. Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), for instance, is caused by a bat coronavirus that can leap to humans after infecting a camel. (It kills 20 percent of its victims; thankfully, it isn’t very contagious.) Novel flu viruses often leap from birds to pigs, whose immune systems closely resemble our own. If a flu virus manages to modify itself well enough to survive in a pig, or if it combines itself inside a pig’s body with an endemic flu virus that can already infect humans, a brand-new virus, to which no one on earth has immunity, can emerge. It has happened repeatedly; it happened in 1918, and it is sure to happen again. The novel coronavirus that causes Covid-19 is a big bomb with a long fuse. It can take two weeks for a person to test positive for it after exposure and then several more weeks or even another month or longer to die from it. The 1918 flu virus was different. “The strongest, the healthiest, the most robust people in the county,” John Barry writes in The Great Influenza, “were being struck down as suddenly as if they had been shot.” That sounds strange, even impossible. It takes time for any disease to establish a foothold and spread throughout the body after initial exposure. But viruses don’t multiply in the body in a linear fashion—especially not the 1918 virus. Each virus that invaded and hijacked a human cell made hundreds of thousands of copies of itself inside that cell over a ten-hour period. Then each of those hundreds of thousands of viruses burst forth at the same time and went on to hijack more cells and make millions more copies. So every ten hours, the flu became hundreds of thousands of times stronger. The number of viruses produced after several ten-hour generations can stagger the minds even of mathematical geniuses. (How many viruses is five hundred thousand times five hundred thousand?) So yes, people literally collapsed while walking down the street, as if shot. Some died within hours. Victims were so starved of oxygen that their faces and bodies turned black-and-blue. Blood poured from their noses, mouths, eyes, and even their ears. Lungs were so ravaged that doctors had seen such destruction only in the victims of poison gas attacks in the trenches of Europe and those killed by the pneumonic plague, the respiratory version of the Black Death. “Although about 20 percent of its victims had a mild disease and recovered without incident,” Kolata writes, “the rest had one of two terrifying illnesses. Some almost immediately became deathly ill, unable to get enough oxygen because their lungs had filled with fluid. They died in days, or even hours, delirious with a high fever, gasping for breath, lapsing at last into unconsciousness. In others, the illness began as an ordinary flu, with chills, fever, and muscle aches, but no untoward symptoms. By the fourth or fifth day of the illness, however, bacteria would swarm into their injured lungs and they would develop pneumonia that would either kill them or lead to a long period of convalescence.” Barry writes of how people were “terrified that, no matter how mild the symptoms seemed at first, within them moved an alien force, a seething, spreading infection, a live thing with a will that was taking over their bodies.” The staggering 100 million death toll was bad enough, but it came with an especially cruel twist: the disease was especially lethal to young people. Those in their prime, in their twenties and thirties, were by far the most likely to die. And among that group, pregnant women were even more vulnerable. As many as 10 percent of young adults worldwide were cut down. Hospitals strangely reported few extreme cases in elderly people, with the vast majority of those who died younger than 40. Various theories attempt to explain why. The most convincing is that many young adults suffered a “cytokine storm,” the immune system’s hydrogen bomb—a dramatic overreaction to an otherwise moderate infection that kills healthy cells along with the pathogen that it has been unleashed to destroy. Elderly people in 1918 rarely suffered such a cytokine storm. Their aging immune systems weren’t strong enough to mount one. And children often fare better with diseases than adults, anyway, from the so-called childhood diseases like measles and chicken pox to Covid-19. But young adults in 1918 were felled as if that were the pandemic’s purpose. Flu viruses mutate constantly, especially the antigen, the part of a pathogen that the immune system recognizes and binds to when it fights back. A viral antigen functions almost like a flag or a military uniform identifying it as a known enemy. When the antigen mutates, the immune system no longer recognizes the invader, so it fails to wage an effective defense before the disease can establish a foothold. Flu antigens are unstable and constantly changing, which is why we need a new vaccine every year that includes antigens of the viruses currently circulating. There’s a difference, though, between “antigenic drift” and “antigenic shift.” If a flu virus antigen mutates a little bit, the immune system can still mount an effective, if belated, defense, reducing the severity of the disease. Antigenic shift is worse—the stuff of an epidemiologist’s nightmares. That’s when the antigen changes so completely that nobody can recognize it, leaving the entire human race exposed and defenseless. This is what makes novel pandemic viruses so much more dangerous than endemic seasonal viruses. With a novel pandemic virus, no herd immunity exists, and the virus can wash over the entire human race like a tsunami. But there was still some immune-system resistance in some parts of the world to the 1918 virus, mostly among Europeans, Asians, and their descendants, whose ancestors had survived repeated flu pandemics in decades and centuries past. “Survivors of plagues,” Kolata writes, “were the genetically lucky ones who had inherited a resistance to the disease-causing organisms. Even in the most extreme plagues, there are resistant people who either do not become infected, no matter how many times they are exposed to the sickness, or who get only a mild disease and recover. When everyone else is dying, the resistant people will be the ones who remain to propagate. Their genes will begin to predominate. And those who were genetically susceptible to the devastating illnesses would lose out in the great Darwinian struggle.” People in Africa, the South Pacific, and the Arctic were more vulnerable. And they died in much larger numbers. So while the flu killed “only” 1 percent or 2 percent of its victims in the Western world, 3 percent to 6 percent of Africa’s population died in a few weeks. Some villages were annihilated down to the last child. In Fiji, 14 percent of the entire population was killed in just 16 days. “It was as if the virus were a hunter,” Barry writes. “It was hunting mankind. It found man in the cities easily, but it was not satisfied. It followed him into towns, then villages, then individual homes. It searched for him in the most distant corners of the earth. It hunted him in the forests, tracked him into jungles, pursued him onto the ice. And in those most distant corners of the earth, in those places so inhospitable that they barely allowed man to live, in those places where man was almost wholly innocent of civilization, man was not safer from the virus. He was more vulnerable.” The virus killed up to one-third of the entire population of Canada’s northern Labrador region. In some Alaska villages, as many as 90 percent of adults perished. Up there especially, it looked and felt like the end of the world. Victor Vaughan at the Council of National Defense wrote that “if the epidemic continues its mathematical rate of acceleration, civilization could easily disappear . . . from the face of the earth within a matter of a few more weeks.” The pandemic came in three distinct waves. The first, which began in Kansas, was the equivalent of a bad seasonal flu in a normal year. Then it quieted down during the summer, as seasonal flus always do, but it returned in a second wave during the fall, and the second wave was apocalyptic. When it had smoldered largely undetected during the summer, the virus had mutated into a perfect killing machine. It exploded with the suddenness of a meteor strike and infected staggering numbers of people in a wide area more or less simultaneously. Barry likens it to the process of a pot of water coming to a boil. “First an isolated bubble releases from the bottom and rises to the surface,” he writes. “Then another. Then two or three simultaneously. Then half a dozen. But unless the heat is turned down, soon enough all the water within the pot is in motion, the surface a roiling violent chaos.” It hit Philadelphia particularly hard. Local officials wouldn’t even consider imposing social distancing recommendations. Ignoring warnings by local doctors, they refused to cancel an upcoming Liberty Loan parade, even after a nearby military base experienced a surge of infections. So tens of thousands of people who had no idea that they were in danger gathered in one place, jam-packed together for hours. Some of them—soldiers from the base, probably—were infected and didn’t know it. They spread the disease during their brief pre-symptomatic period, and the pandemic established a foothold in the city. It didn’t relent until it ran out of victims. Three days after the parade, every bed in the city’s hospitals was full. Hundreds of people died daily. Local officials finally closed businesses and schools; but by then, it was too late. Hundreds of thousands were already sick, and they had all fallen ill at the same time. The flu killed 11,000 people in Philadelphia in a single month. HISTORICAL MEDICAL LIBRARY OF THE COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS OF PHILADELPHIA/THE NEW YORK TIMES/REDUX The health-care system collapsed: not only were the hospitals out of beds; there were no tables in morgues and no coffins for the cemeteries. “Corpses,” Barry writes, “had backed up in homes. They lay on porches, in closets, in corners of the floor, on beds. Children would sneak away from adults to stare at them, to touch them; a wife would lie next to a dead husband, unwilling to move him or leave him. The corpses, reminders of death and bringers of terror or grief, lay under ice at Indian-summer temperatures. Their presence was constant, a horror demoralizing the city.” Then the city, he writes, “began to implode in chaos and fear.” Priests drove wagons down residential streets and told the living to bring out their dead. And what happened in Philadelphia was soon happening everywhere, not just in America but around the world. The pandemic exploded amid World War I, after President Woodrow Wilson had already imposed a Fidel Castro–style censorship regime that suppressed criticism of the government or any other writing or speech that might hurt wartime morale. Wilson’s Sedition Act of 1918 criminalized “disloyal, profane, scurrilous, or abusive language” and punished offenders with up to 20 years in prison. Newspapers and magazines considered “unpatriotic” were canceled, as we would say today. Dissenting civilians were intimidated, and sometimes worse. The government spied on private citizens and arrested them even for casual offhand remarks. These efforts were bolstered by the American Protective League, a secret police network staffed by 250,000 employees who spied on citizens in 600 cities and towns. They implanted themselves as undercover agents in places like factories, where they could listen to conversations. They inspired schoolboys to form their own informant organization, the Anti–Yellow Dog League. “Everywhere,” Barry writes, the APL “spied on neighbors, investigated ‘slackers’ and ‘food hoarders,’ demanded to know why people didn’t buy—or didn’t buy more—Liberty Bonds.” Government posters and ads encouraged friends and neighbors to turn in their own friends and neighbors. Wilson was a Democrat and a leading light of the progressive movement, but not even his political opposition in the Republican Party complained about any of this. Republicans backed the White House’s police state wholeheartedly. Newspapers, either terrified of or in league with the White House, lied about the pandemic daily, even as it scythed through the American population. It’s just the flu, the papers said; calm down. Conspiracy theorists accused the Germans of creating the virus in a lab. The same thing happened in Europe. “Further from the theatre of war,” Spinney writes, “people followed the time-honoured rules of epidemic nomenclature and blamed the obvious other. In Senegal it was the Brazilian flu and in Brazil the German flu, while the Danes thought it ‘came from the south.’ The Poles called it the Bolshevik disease, the Persians blamed the British.” Most European countries likewise imposed wartime censorship regimes no less extreme than Wilson’s. Spain was an exception. A neutral in the war, Spain still had a free press. Spanish journalists were still more or less free to write whatever they wanted. “When the flu arrived in Spain in May,” Spinney writes, “most Spanish people, like most people in general, assumed that it had come from beyond their own borders. In their case, they were right. It had been in America for two months already, and France for a matter of weeks at least. Spaniards didn’t know that, however, because news of the flu was censored in the warring nations.” So when free Spanish journalists published newspaper articles about a terrifying wave of influenza, it appeared that Spain was the only country on earth suffering from this strange new disease. That’s how what could have been called the Kansas flu became the Spanish flu. Thanks to Wilson and his censorship regime, American citizens, including government officials, were living deep inside an informational black hole when the pandemic struck. The government did not fill the void. There was no pandemic task force, no press conferences, no trusted medical experts informing the public via newspaper or radio interviews. There was no plan. There was nothing. Wilson never spoke about the disease publicly. According to Barry, there is no evidence that he even spoke about it privately or asked a single person what might be done about it. He utterly ignored it and abandoned the country, even as the death toll exceeded the number of dead from every war in American history combined. American public health officials hardly did anything to stop the spread in 1918. Some cities closed businesses like movie theaters for a few days, but that was about it. Many cities didn’t even do that much. The pandemic killed 675,000 Americans, the population-adjusted equivalent of roughly 2 million Americans today, but Rupert Blue, Wilson’s man at the Public Health Service, actively sabotaged research into the disease by refusing to fund it. Some governors begged for assistance, but little help arrived, and most local governments abdicated responsibility, just as the federal government did. Most of them, too, behaved as though the pandemic didn’t exist, including Thomas B. Smith, mayor of Philadelphia, America’s hardest-hit city. Like Wilson, he never mentioned it once. Journalists failed as spectacularly as the government. “As terrifying as the disease was,” Barry writes, “the press made it more so. They terrified by making little of it, for what officials and the press said bore no relationship to what people saw and touched and smelled and endured. People could not trust what they read. Uncertainty follows distrust, fear follows uncertainty, and, under conditions such as these, terror follows fear.” Officials and journalists who did bother to say anything insisted that the terror sweeping the country was more dangerous than the flu. The more they lied, the more terrified people became. San Francisco was an exception. It fared better during the brutal second wave than any other major American city—partly, Barry thinks, because of its experience with a historic and devastating earthquake 12 years earlier. The city had already gone through a large-scale disaster that required mass mobilization and the building of a more robust public-health network. Local officials were frank about the threat, and they closed businesses and urged everyone to wear masks. “In San Francisco,” Barry writes, “people felt a sense of control.” As with Covid-19 a century later, public officials in 1918 closed businesses and urged people to wear masks. (ATOMIC/ALAMY STOCK PHOTO) The failures in managing the illness were not uniquely American—they were civilization-wide. “The major Italian newspaper the Corriere della Sera took an original stance in reporting daily death tolls from flu,” Spinney writes, “until civil authorities forced it to stop doing so on the grounds that it was stirring up anxiety among the citizenry. . . . The authorities don’t seem to have realised that the paper’s ensuing silence on the matter bred even greater anxiety.” As Barry wrote in 2004: “Those in authority must retain the public’s trust. The way to do that is to distort nothing, to put the best face on nothing, to try to manipulate no one. Lincoln said that first, and best. A leader must make whatever horror exists concrete. Only then will people be able to break it apart.” The Spanish flu pandemic lasted a year and a half, with different parts of the world hardest hit at different times. The virus couldn’t last a year and a half everywhere: it was so ferociously infectious that it exploded throughout a given population until a critical mass of people were either dead or immune. When it ran out of victims in one place, it moved on to pulverize somewhere else. The third and final wave wasn’t as virulent as the second. The virus had mutated into a somewhat less lethal form, though it was still vicious—if the third wave were treated as its own isolated outbreak, it would have registered as the second-deadliest pandemic in history. Australia managed to avoid the second wave entirely by walling itself off from the rest of the world, but the surprise third wave pierced the country’s defenses, and the terror and death that swept through its cities and towns was described as if it were the bubonic plague. Elsewhere, many who had been infected by the second wave got sick again in the third wave, but the disease was milder for them because they had partial immunity from their earlier exposure. Having been spared the second wave, Australians had no such protection. Roughly a year and a half after it appeared, the pandemic finally subsided. The virus still lurked, but it infected people far less frequently, and those who did fall ill were more likely to survive. So many had already been infected that a degree of herd immunity had been achieved; there simply weren’t as many potential victims or as many potential spreaders. As American virologist Jeffery Taubenberger explained to Kolata: “A flu that is so freakishly perfect for killing people is far out on the edge of what is possible for influenza viruses, meaning that any mutations will make it less deadly.” It is a virus in “perfect balance,” Taubenberger said, “and it is a balance that will tip toward the more mundane type of flu with the tiniest nudge.” The virus had checkmated itself. That, rather than science and medicine, is what ended the 1918 pandemic. This is not likely to happen with the novel coronavirus. Unlike flu viruses, it’s relatively stable. It mutates more slowly. And unlike the 1918 flu virus, in particular, the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is not the most efficient killer that a coronavirus possibly can be. The original SARS killed roughly 10 percent of its victims before testing, contact tracing, and isolation forced it into extinction, and MERS kills roughly 20 percent. Fortunately for the world, the coronaviruses that cause those diseases are much less transmissible than the youngest member of that murderous family. While governments in 1918 failed largely through negligence and denial, medical scientists dedicated every waking moment to treating patients and searching for the pathogen so that they could develop a cure or vaccine. They failed heroically. Science simply hadn’t advanced far enough. Doctors weren’t sure if the disease was caused by bacteria or a virus, and viruses are so small that no one ever saw one until more than a decade later, with the invention of the electron microscope. Creating a vaccine back then wasn’t possible. Nature itself saved us—but only after running its course. The novel coronavirus is not as deadly as the 1918 flu virus, but it could still kill millions of people. The difference is that this time we are willing—and able—to fight back. Michael J.

By Hayley Sugg Published on December 30, 2020 As the novel coronavirus continues to spread across the globe, it's hard to not look back at humanity's most recent pandemic, the 1918 flu, and draw comparisons. Today, people are facing product shortages, looking to healthier food options, and avoiding crowded restaurants, all predicaments which are mirrored from a century ago. So how exactly did these major changes impact the eating habits of your average American in 1918? We turned to Lora Vogt, Curator of Education at the National WWI Museum and Memorial, for some answers and interesting facts about this tumultuous time in our nation's history. An advertisement for OXO's Fluid Beef product, said to help with resistance against "the attacks of the influenza organism.". The National WWI Museum and Memorial New Nutrition Nutrition was a relatively new field at the time of the flu pandemic. "Late 1800s and early 1900s, there is this real big push of home economics and the science of nutrition," says Vogt. "There are minerals, there are calories, there are vitamins. These are all relatively newer discoveries in this time frame." And with this new focus on nutrition, it made citizens more interested than ever about how what they eat could impact their susceptibility to influenza. This burgeoning curiosity prompted some companies, such as OXO with their "fluid beef" ad, to make health claims about boosting vitality and increasing resistance to illness. There was a push to focus on consuming "perfect" foods with lots of nutritional value, such as whole eggs or milk. It was also thought at the time that the less components a dish had the better it was for you. "There's a concept that if you had too many ingredients in one food it might be hard for your body to digest it," says Vogt. "Clearly that's not science. They were getting there." And as interest in the science of nutrition increased, so did the amount of "fad" nutrition advice, most of which made no actual impact on consumer's health. Vogt says that some ingredients, such as vinegar or onions, were viewed as potential cures or preventatives for the influenza. But in reality, it's probable that dishes like onion soup (recipe below) made people feel better by simply being a nutrient-rich and warming meal. Of all the ingredients to gain traction during the 1918 flu pandemic, sugar was the biggest contender. "The Food Administrators urged state representatives to make sure that flu victims got extra sugar to help boost their energy," says Vogt. Just like sugar was used to fuel troops on the frontlines of WWI, it was also used to invigorate those suffering from influenza.

Allied Cookery / The National WWI Museum and Memorial Restaurants of the Time Just as the novel coronavirus has people avoiding packed restaurants today, so did the 1918 flu to some extent. "This is a disease from being around other people who had it," says Vogt. "So there was absolutely an encouragement to stay away from others, avoid crowded spaces." She goes on to reveal that some of the common advice about eating at restaurants during the time included avoiding sharing mugs or canteens, to not overeat, and "be fussy about the quality of your eats and drinks." While it's possible that some establishments shut down, it seems many restaurants stayed open (at least in major cities) as essential businesses during the pandemic to cater to kitchen-less apartment dwellers. Cincinnati Museum Center / Getty Images The War's Impact Even though there was no government-mandated rationing during WWI, reducing consumption of goods like meat, wheat flour, and fats was considered a supportive act that could help fuel American troops on the front lines. This mindset didn't necessarily end with the Armistice of November 11, 1918 and blurred over into the flu pandemic. "We changed our relationship with the food for patriotic reasons with the war, but then because of the flu, we also have this shift as well," says Vogt. The war also had a direct impact on consumers, tangling up products in route to grocery stores. "There are some shortages, but they come in many ways the same way our shortages occurred [now]. Not because we didn't have the things, it's not because there was a blight to the crops, it was because of supply chain," says Vogt. As millions of soldiers and volunteers travelled across the country for training, shipping out, and returning to U.S. soil, more passenger trains took over the rails, meaning less products were carried across the states. Vogt expands upon how both the combination of a pandemic and major war changed America, "There's even a greater impact on the nation with the flu in some ways, there were more deaths attributed to that than necessarily for Americans in combat. So that all kind of mixes into one pot. In some ways similar to today." Then and Now As we all continue to grapple with today's challenges, from the coronavirus pandemic to political elections to a dwindling economy, it's important to remember we're not the first (nor are we likely to be the last) timeframe of Americans to face these issues. Something as simple as knowing that people a century ago were also serving up soup to nourish sick loved ones can be a comfort. "There are so many great stories and it's complicated, and complicated time frames are the most helpful to be reading about to understand," says Vogt. "To help not only inform our present and our future, but also help kind of create this enduring impact."

Cases had dropped by the winter of 1919. Dr. Charles V. Chapin was a Brown University graduate and a pioneer in public health in Providence and the nation. He wrote a column for The Journal in January 1921 with a hopeful prediction that the influenza would not return. By then, all kinds of elixirs with very dubious properties were being advertised to help people stay healthy.

Read our privacy policyEarlier this year, as the world came to terms with the coronavirus pandemic, a letter purporting to have been written by F Scott Fitzgerald in the midst of the 1918 flu pandemic did the rounds on the internet. It was, of course, a parody, but the writing style and notes to his pal Ernest Hemingway meant the letter – unless you’re a Fitzgerald expert – was pretty convincing.“At this time, it seems very poignant to avoid all public spaces,” it reads. “Even the bars, as I told Hemingway, but to that he punched me in the stomach, to which I asked if he had washed his hands. He hadn’t. He is much the denier, that one. Why, he considers the virus to be just influenza. I’m curious of his sources.”Its real author, Nick Farriella, had expertly muddied the tone of Fitzgerald’s language with some contemporary, 21st-century concerns, and a dash of the cliched image of the character we’ve come to know as “Hemingway” – something of a macho bore, brawler and liar.It’s an unfortunate but sometimes well-deserved persona, as I have come to know intimately whilst doing research for a new book examining Hemingway’s often ignored, shadowy time spent in London and Europe before and after D-Day.RecommendedWoman, 102, who survived cancer and Spanish Flu beats Covid – twiceThis was an arguably defining time in his life and career, when he was possibly the best-known living writer in the world and something of a one-man global commercial brand. Even then, I discovered that when he was in the company of undercover spies and authors (sometimes both, as in the case of Roald Dahl) he could be, by turns, thoughtful, loving, brilliant, brave, embarrassing, abusive and downright nasty.For some, the tone of the parody pandemic letter was a brief moment of entertainment because it was the return of the cartoonish wild-eyed and comical version of Hemingway from Woody Allen’s Midnight in Paris. For others, who knew a little more about Hemingway, it was yet another simplistic attempt to besmirch his deeply complex legacy – fake news, you might say.Hemingway and the factsIn reality, Hemingway’s response to the pandemic of 1918-19 – and later waves too – was very different from the parody. The truth is effortlessly stranger and more enigmatic than any fiction. Of course, Hemingway was guilty of hyping facts to meet his mantra that fiction could be truer than the truth, but that didn’t change his basic respect for scientific facts and the natural world.open image in galleryHemingway in Milan in 1918 (John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum, Boston)He was, after all, the dutiful son of a doctor from Oak Park, Illinois, and had witnessed first-hand his father’s work, using the experiences in his later fictional works. Hemingway scholar Susan Beegel has shown how serious illness, disease, and sudden and prolonged death were nothing new to him. He was aware, in humans and animals, of the fragility of life.The GP’s son later had his own appalling experiences in the First World War, when he volunteered for the Red Cross. Bad eyesight meant normal duty was out of the question, but a determined Hemingway used the Red Cross to get to the Italian front line instead.Within hours of arriving in Italy, Hemingway was tasked with cleaning up the body parts of victims of shelling, a sight that both fascinated and horrified him and which he recounted in his controversial short story A Natural History of the Dead. Within weeks he would be pulled off a battlefield himself, a bloodied wreck more dead than alive, with 228 pieces of shrapnel embedded in his legs. Long days and painful nights of touch-and-go recuperation followed.After shadowing Red Cross nurses, Hemingway wrote about the worst death he ever saw. It hadn’t been from a bomb or a bullet: “The only natural death I've ever seen, outside of loss of blood, which isn't bad, was death from Spanish influenza. In this you drown in mucus, choking, and how you know the patient’s dead is: at the end he turns to be a little child again, though with his manly force, and fills the sheets as full as any diaper with one vast, final, yellow cataract that flows and dribbles on after he's gone.”This horrendous scene was common amidst a global pandemic that had claimed 50 million people by December 1919. There was no coordinated national and international research as we would know it, no effective treatment, and certainly no vaccine on the way. Soldiers and volunteers like Hemingway were swimming in the virus.Dodging diseaseFor a while, quarantining was all very jolly. By day, Hemingway dedicated himself to editing corrections to his soon-to-be bestseller ‘The Sun Also Rises’Yet Hemingway dodged the peaks of the 1918-19 pandemic waves by weeks, sometimes days, as he convalesced in Italy, and then returned to the US. Once home, he discovered family and friends had perished from it. Despite youthful public insouciance, all these experiences privately scarred him, and that dying soldier in Italy was never far from his mind.According to his masterful biographer Michael Reynolds, Hemingway’s superstition around death meant that “the slightest possibility of flu often sent him scurrying for healthier conditions, for he had a particular horror of drowning in his own fluids”. Consequently, in 1926 and now living in Paris, when his young son Jack, nicknamed “Bumby”, developed a “hacking cough”, Hemingway immediately sent him and his wife, Hadley, off to the clean air and sunshine of the Riviera to recover, while he went solo to Spain to work.Hadley and Bumby Hemingway arrived in Antibes on 26 May 1926, and the child was immediately diagnosed with the infectious – and potentially fatal – whooping cough. Quarantine was called for, so both were summarily housed by their hosts, the ever-generous patrons of the arts Sara and Gerald Murphy, in a small dwelling near their own 14-roomed Villa America.One week later they were moved again, under quarantine conditions, to a hastily vacated Villa Paquita at Juan-les-Pins, previously inhabited by Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, who had zipped off to the safety of another coastal retreat. To complicate matters, Hemingway’s mistress Pauline Pfeiffer, a chic editor at Vogue magazine, arrived from Paris, and within 48 hours, they were joined fresh from Madrid by the central figure in this peculiar set-up, Hemingway himself.For a while, quarantining was all very jolly. By day, Hemingway dedicated himself to editing corrections to his soon-to-be bestseller The Sun Also Rises. By evening, everyone gathered for socially distanced cocktails with the Murphys and Fitzgeralds, who stayed outside the garden fence. Empty bottles, drained and upended, were mounted like heads on the spiked fence. Each one marked another day of quarantine for the Hemingway child.It worked – to an extent.Quarantine ended when his son got better, though as a precaution, Bumby and his nanny were housed nearby, leaving Hemingway in a nice hotel with the two women. He pretended he was happy, but inevitably the post-lockdown arrangement slid into emotional anarchy. He and Hadley argued, while Pfeiffer hung on for the prize she wanted most – Hemingway himself. It stayed that way as everyone decamped from the Riviera to Pamplona in Spain for the annual fiesta.Within a year of that quarantined summer, the Hemingways were divorced.Eleven years later, in 1937, despite quarantining in the village of Saranac Lake, in upstate New York, the Murphys’ 16-year-old son, Patrick, died from tuberculosis.RecommendedNewspaper apologises for decades of racist coverageThe story behind the ramshackle Paris bookshop beloved by HemingwayFrom Hemingway to HG Wells: The books banned and burnt by the NazisHemingway rose at dawn on 2 July 1961 in Idaho and took his own life.Jack Hemingway had a happier outcome than most in his family.

There are many similarities between the Spanish flu and the COVID-19 pandemic. (SRH Whitehead)Social SharingWhen historian Ruth Holmes Whitehead started research in 2017 for a book looking at the Spanish flu outbreak in Nova Scotia a century prior, she had no idea she'd end up living in a pandemic."It's awful because you sort of automatically have this [bad] feeling ... how this is going to turn out," said the author of Nova Scotia and the Great Influenza Pandemic, 1918-1920, which was published last November.An estimated 50-100 million people died from the Spanish flu around the world, while in Nova Scotia, there were an estimated 2,200 deaths.To date, there have been 65 deaths due to COVID-19 in Nova Scotia and more than 1.8 million globally.Much like COVID-19 today, the Spanish flu originally found its way into the province through travel and then spread from there. This included troops returning overseas from the First World War, Massachusetts fishermen who landed here to sell fish and gear, and even American military ships headed to Europe who unloaded their sick before they trekked across the Atlantic for the Great War.Men in Alberta wear masks, likely made of cheesecloth and twine, during the Spanish influenza epidemic. Masks have long been worn to help prevent transmission of viruses. (Library and Archives Canada / PA-025025)Spread was also fuelled by gathering in crowds. One such instance was a church service in Goshen, Guysborough County. The word didn't exist then, but it would be called a superspreader event today.Holmes Whitehead said the Goshen Baptist Church burned down in August 1918 after it was struck by lightning, so parishioners started meeting in a tiny schoolroom in neighbouring Eight Island Lake. A minister from Antigonish, N.S., conducted one of the services in the packed room.A century after the Spanish flu hit N.S., historians now chronicling the impact"Before he left, he had infected the whole congregation of about 50 people and he'd also infected everybody in the house that was hosting him ... the death records say only three people died — a young farmer, an older married woman and a baby — but that doesn't tell us anything about the number of people in that general area that got sick from this one person and this one crowded situation," said Holmes Whitehead, who has worked for the Nova Scotia Museum for almost 50 years.Her research on the Spanish flu was used for an online museum exhibit to mark the pandemic's 100th anniversary, but there was so much additional information she had gathered that a book was a better fit for all of it.Some of the symptoms of Spanish flu could be particularly gruesome."It presents with a high fever and a feeling of terrible pain in all your joints and what was described as having a wedge hammered into your head, right behind your eyes, and people began bleeding from their noses, ears and eyes," said Holmes Whitehead.U.S. soldiers are shown in Liverpool, England, on Aug. 11, 1918. Troops heading overseas from the U.S. to fight in the First World War helped bring the Spanish flu to Nova Scotia as ships with infected people were diverted to the province to get medical care. (NAID 86697765/National Archives and Records Administration)"They were basically just out of their minds with pain and the lungs filled up and they drowned in their own bodily fluids and their bodies were so reduced in oxygen that often their hands and feet would turn blue," she said."And some people turned blue all over, a really dark blue, just because all the blood in their body was empty of oxygen."In the 100 years that separate both the Spanish flu and COVID-19, little has changed in terms of how society responds to them, such as wearing masks to help prevent transmission.Nurses care for victims of a Spanish influenza epidemic outdoors amid canvas tents in Lawrence, Mass., in this undated photo from 1918. Fishermen from Massachusetts were one of the sources of Nova Scotia's Spanish flu outbreak. (Getty Images)"Our tools are not that much different," said Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia's chief medical officer of health."We close things down. We restrict public activities. We tell people to stay home. We may have lots more fancy, modern medical tools, but at the end of the day when it comes to something like a pandemic, it's basic core public health, which hasn't changed for 100 years and probably won't change for the next 100 years, which is somewhat humbling."Holmes Whitehead said that besides being able to test for COVID-19, one other difference today is there are so many platforms to communicate to people about what's happening and what they should do."And if you keep drilling it into their heads, maybe some of it will sink in," she said.Two men in Paris wear flu masks on March 1, 1919, and carry signs advocating for the use of the mask as a means of prevention from the Spanish flu epidemic. (Getty Images)In the midst of the second wave, Holmes Whitehead continues to hunker down at her Halifax apartment to ride out the coronavirus pandemic — and she has a message for people."Stay inside and wear your mask and wash your hands and don't be stupid," said Holmes Whitehead. "You know, this is not a picnic, it's not like the flu, it's really horrible. It can have lasting physiological, neurological effects that you really don't want to go there."Please stay safe."MORE TOP STORIESTown of Mulgrave hopes to hire new CAO in JanuaryN.S. man donates parcel of land to mark 50 years since immigrating to CanadaVideo7-year-old teaches Mi'kmaw quillwork, a skill she learned from her momNova Scotia microbreweries raise a toast to home deliveries amid pandemicWith files from Kayla HounsellCBC's Journalistic Standards and Practices|About CBC NewsCorrections and clarifications|Submit a news tip|Report errorFooter LinksMy AccountProfileCBC GemNewslettersAbout CBC AccountsConnect with CBCFacebookXYouTubeInstagramMobileRSSPodcastsContact CBCSubmit FeedbackHelp CentreAudience Relations, CBC P.O.

The hotel and stores were closed. Bags of unsorted mail piled up in the shuttered post office.In larger cities, people were dying in such large numbers that they couldn’t be interred as usual. Montreal ran out of coffins and used delivery wagons as makeshift hearses. In Toronto, bodies piled up in cemetery vaults, awaiting burial.On the East Coast, the Cape Breton village of Marble Mountain also looked deserted. “The village store is left wide open, and those who are physically able serve themselves as no clerks are now available.”Those details appeared a century ago in The Globe, the newspaper that would become The Globe and Mail. The full force of the Spanish influenza had reached North America just in the last months of the First World War, in a pandemic that eventually killed 50,000 Canadians and 50 million people around the world.The reports in The Globe from 1918 contain eerie similarities with today’s pandemic.When will Canadians get COVID-19 vaccines? The federal and provincial rollout plans so farAuthorities banned public gatherings and shut down businesses. Some people complained about having to wear masks. The Stanley Cup finals were disrupted. The U.S. president, Woodrow Wilson, and Canadian prime minister Robert Borden both caught the flu.There were differences, too. There was little co-ordination from Ottawa or provincial governments, leaving local officials to fend for themselves. Little attention was paid to the economic toll or how governments could help. Unlike COVID-19, the Spanish flu hit children and young adults the hardest.We read more than two years of coverage in The Globe to see how it covered that crisis. Here’s what the Spanish flu looked like to readers of the time. Page seven of The Globe’s edition of Sept. 19, 1918, included this report on a Spanish influenza outbreak at a camp for army volunteers near Niagara-on-the-Lake. HOW IT ARRIVEDResearchers now believe that the pandemic started in the spring of 1918, in a “herald wave” that wasn’t very lethal. In Canada, it went largely unnoticed.In April, Dr. Charles Hastings, then Toronto’s medical officer of health, was asked about the city’s numerous cases of pneumonia and influenza. “Dr. Hastings laid the blame partly on the season and partly on the prevalence of dust,” The Globe reported. “The mucous membranes are sensitive this time of the year.”The first public notice of a large-scale problem emerged from Spain, giving the illness its name, though it didn’t originate there. “A strange illness that resembles the flu” emptied Madrid’s theatres and sickened many Spaniards, The Globe published in May. By the summer, military camps in the United States suffered outbreaks affecting thousands.Then the second wave struck, arriving in Canada in mid-September, when 150 became sick and three died at an army camp for Polish American volunteers near Niagara-on-the-Lake. Major Thomas Morrison, a camp official, predicted the outbreak would end soon “with the advent of a few fine days.”Unreported in The Globe was the flu’s first outbreak among civilians, in the Quebec town of Victoriaville, after the Sept. 15 end of a Roman Catholic eucharistic congress that drew 40,000 faithful. The final day of the event included a mass at a local boarding school, the Sacré-Coeur college. Right afterward, teaching brothers and students at the college started to get sick and die.Open this photo in gallery:A masked boy stands outside Toronto's closed Royal Alexandra Theatre in 1918.City of Toronto ArchivesSHUTDOWNS AND LOCKDOWNSTroubling news came from Sydney, N.S., where a ship landed on Sept. 21 with 500 ailing American soldiers. Within days, eight died. A curling rink and church halls became hospitals. Theatres, dance halls and schools closed.Near Montreal, soldiers became sick at a depot in Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu. The conscription crisis might have contributed to the contagion when military police detained suspected draft dodgers who later fell ill. On Oct. 7, Montreal ordered schools, theatres and dance halls to close.Ontario still hadn’t fully grasped the threat. On Page 8, The Globe buried a story with the headline “Spanish Flu Invades City,” where Dr. Hastings assured that the “outbreak is little different to that of other fall seasons, except, if anything, it is a little milder.” The Globe reported that authorities felt “no alarm.”Then infections skyrocketed. The death toll, reported in daily summaries, climbed steadily. Factories reported severe shortages of workers. Funeral directors could not keep up with the dead. Hospitals overflowed as doctors and nurses fell ill.Toronto eventually followed other cities in shutting down public activities. Dr. Hastings advised people to shop by telephone and walk to work. Hotels were turned into makeshift hospitals. Court witnesses no longer had to kiss the Bible when taking an oath.Conventions and other gatherings were banned, followed by the closure of theatres, libraries and pool halls. Churches cancelled Sunday services or held shorter ones. “Toronto woke yesterday morning to a silent Sabbath, very few church bells called people to worship and a hush seemed to fall upon the whole city,” The Globe reported.The flu then reached the western provinces. Alberta made face coverings compulsory while outdoors. “Everyone in Edmonton had to wear a mask; you could not ride on a streetcar without it,” one resident told The Globe.Lethbridge was quarantined. Trains were locked down when they neared the city. In other Prairie towns along the rail lines, “guards are placed at the depots, and intending visitors are informed that they can enter the town only if prepared to remain until the epidemic has abated.”Almost as soon as officials ordered widespread closings, their thoughts turned to when they could lift those restrictions, expecting the outbreaks would be over in just days or weeks.By early November, cities across Ontario and Quebec lifted their orders. Dr. Hastings announced that “the bottom has dropped out of the influenza epidemic.”This created a pattern, alternating between outbreaks and periods of calm, shutdowns and reopenings, as cases repeatedly flared again into 1920.Some members of the public pushed back against the medical restrictions.The priest at a church in Quebec defied orders to close and officials promised legal consequence. In Alberta, there were grumbles in local newspapers about the provincial order to cover faces when outdoors.Globe readers found the restrictions confusing and contradictory. One letter to the editor asked why theatres and churches had to close, while streetcars remained crowded. “Did the Medical Health Officer ever ride downtown at 8 o’clock in the morning on a Dundas car? If not, he better put on a ‘flu’ mask and take the trip for once. … The danger to health from riding to and from work under such conditions is infinitely greater than sitting quietly in a well-ventilated church.”Open this photo in gallery:A Globe headline from Oct. 15, 1918, notes new public-health orders from Charles Hastings, Toronto's top public health official.The Globe and MailDR. HASTINGSLike contemporary public-health officers who have become household names, the Spanish flu gave prominence to the early pioneers of preventive medicine such as Dr. Hastings.He is recognized today as a key figure who improved the city’s sanitation in the early 20th century, reducing infant mortality and eradicating typhoid and tuberculosis.Near retirement as a hospital physician, he turned to public health, spurred by the memory of a daughter who died of typhoid fever after she drank tainted raw milk. He started campaigning for pasteurization and better inspections of milk.He became Toronto’s medical health officer in 1910, saying on his appointment that “I am anxious to make Toronto the banner city of the Dominion in the matter of health.”He held the post for two decades. He advocated medical inspections at school to contain diphtheria and scarlet fever. Seeing that city officials revamped plumbing systems but still let sewage disposal taint the water supply, he complained in a speech that “they strain at a gnat and swallow a camel”Like some other prominent Canadians at the time, he believed in eugenics. He warned that “the subnormal are producing two or three times as rapidly as the mentally normal,” and wanted to prevent “the spread and multiplication of worthless members of society.”He retired in 1931, hailed as a man who had made Toronto more salubrious. But despite his skills, his handling of the Spanish flu was limited by the knowledge of the time. A front-page Globe story on Oct. 21, 1918, announces the debut of a University of Toronto lab’s flu vaccine, which Ontario hospitals were already beginning to use. They developed the vaccine with samples of the virus obtained from New York and Boston health officials. CURES AND VACCINESAlthough Dr. Hastings warned people against squandering money on remedies of dubious value against the flu, stores ran out of menthol, camphor and lozenges. Makers of syrups, laxative, quinine tablets or meat extracts also claimed their products helped ward the flu.During the war, the sale of spirits was restricted in much of Canada. One exception was liquor prescribed for medical reasons. By 1919, Ontario doctors had penned more than half a million prescriptions for whiskey. Police had to keep order as people lined up outside dispensaries selling liquor.Meanwhile, Canadian researchers were part of the worldwide effort to isolate the flu strain and immunize the population.A Queen’s University bacteriologist, Guilford Reed, tested a vaccine on 200 volunteers. The Connaught Laboratories, then part of the University of Toronto, produced another vaccine and shipped out thousands of doses to hospitals and the military.The Globe described those scientists as “working for humanity.”“In the solitude of their laboratories, they labour with germs and poisons,” The Globe reported. “They do this for no personal reward. Their discoveries never yield them great riches. … But they carry on that life may be safer and better for those about them, and for those who come after them.”Those vaccines had a key shortcoming: Scientists at the time didn’t know that a virus, rather than larger bacteria, caused influenza. Nevertheless, modern researchers say those vaccines helped by reducing lethal bacterial complications in flu patients. The Globe published this lecture for volunteer nurses written by Margaret Patterson, a Toronto doctor who led the training of volunteers across the province. SISTERS OF SERVICEAs flu cases spiked up, it became clear the health care system would not be able to cope. Many nurses and doctors were overseas for the war. Others became sick, leaving hospitals short staffed. Many victims died at home without ever receiving medical care.The Ontario government responded by mobilizing volunteer nurses as part of a new organization: Sisters of Service, or S.O.S. An Oct. 15 story announced a “new army to fight the flu,” with 60 women signing up during the first meeting at the legislature. As many as 2,000 volunteer nurses eventually joined the fight.Margaret Patterson, a Toronto doctor who recently returned from fighting the bubonic plague in India, led the training effort. She held daily lectures and pamphlets with her lessons were distributed across the province.Three of her lectures were printed in The Globe, addressed “to young lady volunteers.” They detailed instructions on monitoring and treating the symptoms, using household materials. “We are called upon to meet an emergency, a very old disease that is comparatively new to the present generation,” one of the lectures said.Sisters of Service was part of a network of women’s organizations that rallied to respond to the Spanish flu, providing nursing services, making supplies such as pneumonia jackets to keep patients’ lungs warm and cooking for the sick. Those groups also included the Imperial Order Daughters of the Empire, who still operate today as IODE Canada.Open this photo in gallery:Residents of Okak, an Inuit community on Labrador's northern coast, are shown circa 1908.

One child was already dead. The other was gravely ill and died in hospital.An earlier Globe article in November described another Indigenous woman who also came to Chapleau with two flu-stricken children. The woman, who was sick herself, had to portage her canoe for 10 kilometres with children in tow. She said she had left behind another woman and her two ailing children. They were later found dead.The news from Brunswick House and other First Nations showed the reach of the flu in Indigenous communities, with fatality rates in some areas that were 10 times higher than nearby cities and towns.One article reported that 86 out of 100 Inuit died at the Hebron mission in northern Labrador. Weakened survivors gathered together and left the dead in the other huts. They later discovered that the sled dogs had eaten the bodies. They had to kill the dogs and buried the remains of the dead in a hole cut in the frozen sea.The flu also hit Indigenous communities in the west very hard, particularly in Manitoba. On the Cross Lake First Nation, nearly everyone was infected and 130 died out of a population of 500. The flu killed 120 of the Norway House Cree Nation – one in six residents. “It was something terrible, whole families wiped right out,” a Globe story read.Open this photo in gallery:Telephone operators in High River, Alta., wear masks to protect themselves from the flu in 1918.Glenbow ArchivesWHAT WE MISSEDWhile The Globe already billed itself “Canada’s national Newspaper,” its coverage of the Spanish flu often focused on Toronto and Ontario. There were updates about Quebec, but, beyond that, only occasional dispatches from the East Coast and Western Canada.Even in Toronto, the coverage was often sporadic and tucked deep into the paper, drowned out by news from the war in Europe, which neared its end just when infections in Canada reached their peak. A Globe headline from April 2, 1919, notes an outbreak among the Montreal Canadiens hockey team, who were in Seattle to play. THE LAST WAVEA lasting legacy of the pandemic was the creation of the federal Health Department. The idea of a national health ministry had been around for years, though largely discussed as a way to prevent venereal diseases. The ravages of the Spanish flu propelled the idea forward.“The epidemic which is now ravaging Canada has brought the question up again in urgent form before the government,” The Globe reported.Another wave of the flu in the spring of 1919 forced the finals of the Stanley Cup to be called off after five games between the Seattle Metropolitans and the Montreal Canadiens. Five players for the Habs became sick and one, Joe Hall, later died. Team manager George Kennedy also caught the flu and never fully recovered, dying two years later.In many countries, the Spanish flu faded away by 1919. However, in Canada, there was a final wave in early 1920.It struck Lieutenant-Colonel Dick Worrall, a picaresque figure who rose from private to commanding a battalion during the war. Born in England, he lied about his age to enlist at 16 in a British infantry regiment in 1906. He later enrolled in the U.S. Army, where he was garrisoned on an island when war started in 1914. He deserted, swam ashore then jumped onto a freight train to Quebec to join the Royal Montreal Regiment.After the Armistice, he settled in Montreal and married Lorraine Welch, a war widow whose first husband, Captain Charles Crowdy, died from German shelling.In February, 1920, Welch became ill with the flu. Her husband also contracted the disease while looking after her.Worrall, who had survived the German gas attacks at Ypres and led night patrols in no man’s land, died shortly after midnight following nine days at Royal Victoria Hospital.As one Globe article noted during the pandemic, “Never since the black death has such a plague swept the world.”Sign up for the Coronavirus Update newsletter to read the day’s essential coronavirus news, features and explainers written by Globe reporters.Please enable JavaScript to view this content.Report an editorial errorReport a technical issueEditorial code of conductFollow related authors and topicsTu Thanh HaJames KellerAuthors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following.Interact with The GlobeTrendingOpinionI served in Afghanistan.

ARTICLE BY Staff Reporter PUBLISHED 28 Dec 2020 ARTICLE BY Staff Reporter PUBLISHED 28 Dec 2020 UPDATED: 22 Dec 2023, 5:43 am The Municipal Affairs Bureau (IAM) has been paying close attention to a human case of avian influenza A H5N6 that was confirmed in Hunan province earlier this month, pledging that it will maintain “good” communication with its counterparts in the mainland with the aim of protecting Macao from the avian influenza risk. In a statement on Saturday, the bureau urged local residents to avoid going to places where live poultry and birds are sold or displayed when travelling outside Macao. Macao has banned the import and sale of live poultry since May 2017. According to mainland media reports, the case involved a 54-year-old woman who tested positive for H5N6 on 19 December. The woman was believed to have contracted the virus at a live poultry market in Ningyuan county in Yongzhou city after having been in contact with live chicken. She was hospitalised on 13 December after developing symptoms. “As the season changes, there is now an increased risk of avian influenza cases being reported in neighbouring regions, a situation to which the Municipal Affairs Bureau will be constantly paying attention,” the IAM statement said. Apart from maintaining “good” communication with the mainland authorities, the Municipal Affairs Bureau will review its avian flu prevention and control measures and contingency plans in response to the possibility of Macao confirming avian influenza cases, the statement said, pointing out that Macao currently does not import any poultry products and eggs from Yongzhou. The statement said that IAM officials will continue their routine tests of samples taken from the city’s migratory bird habitats and zoos as well as from wild bird carcasses. Including the latest case, 26 human cases of H5N6 avian influenza have been reported by the mainland health authorities since 2014.

The reason on Thursday was confirmed as cases of Avian Flu. Rajasthan: Bird flu confirmed in Jhalawar, Sec 144 imposed Written by Satata Karmakar |Updated : January 1, 2021 10:32 AM IST At a time when coronavirus is still wreaking havoc across the country, a high alert has been sounded across Rajasthan after Avian Influenza was confirmed in the samples of around 100 crows that were found dead in Jhalawar. The same samples have been sent to Bhopal for further testing. According to the reports, the Jhalawar district administration has imposed Section 144 in the affected area in Radi, Rajasthan.What is Avian Flu or Bird Flu?Avian influenza is a disease caused by infection with avian (bird) influenza (flu) Type A viruses. These viruses occur naturally among wild aquatic birds worldwide and can infect domestic poultry and other bird and animal species. Avian flu viruses do not normally infect humans. However, sporadic human infections with avian flu viruses have occurred.

Officials said they suspect water contamination as one of the reasons for the deaths but were awaiting viscera test reports. The Beginning Of The Avian Flu or Bird FluOn December 27, around 100 crows were found dead in a local temple situated in Jhalawar, which is an erstwhile princely state situated in the southeast corner of Rajasthan. The city is 341km from the state capital here.On testing their samples tested positive for avian influenza, forest officials stated.

In most cases, they resemble those of conventional influenza, including:-Cough-Fever-Sore throat-Muscle aches-Headache-Shortness of breathSome people also experience nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. And in a few cases, a mild eye infection (conjunctivitis) is the only indication of the disease.The bird flu, also known as H5N1 virus, is a viral infection spread from bird to bird. H5N1 virus can infect people but no human bird flu case has ever been recorded in India despite several outbreaks among birds.According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), avian influenzas do not easily infect humans, and it's unusual for them to spread from person to person.
