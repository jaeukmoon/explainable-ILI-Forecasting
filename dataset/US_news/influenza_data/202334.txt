Routine annual influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons aged ≥6 months who do not have contraindications. All seasonal influenza vaccines expected to be available in the United States for the 2023–24 season are quadrivalent, containing hemagglutinin (HA) derived from one influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, one influenza A(H3N2) virus, one influenza B/Victoria lineage virus, and one influenza B/Yamagata lineage virus. Inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV4s), recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV4), and live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV4) are expected to be available. For most persons who need only 1 dose of influenza vaccine for the season, vaccination should ideally be offered during September or October. However, vaccination should continue after October and throughout the season as long as influenza viruses are circulating and unexpired vaccine is available. Influenza vaccines might be available as early as July or August, but for most adults (particularly adults aged ≥65 years) and for pregnant persons in the first or second trimester, vaccination during July and August should be avoided unless there is concern that vaccination later in the season might not be possible. Certain children aged 6 months through 8 years need 2 doses; these children should receive the first dose as soon as possible after vaccine is available, including during July and August. Vaccination during July and August can be considered for children of any age who need only 1 dose for the season and for pregnant persons who are in the third trimester during these months if vaccine is available. ACIP recommends that all persons aged ≥6 months who do not have contraindications receive a licensed and age-appropriate seasonal influenza vaccine. With the exception of vaccination for adults aged ≥65 years, ACIP makes no preferential recommendation for a specific vaccine when more than one licensed, recommended, and age-appropriate vaccine is available. ACIP recommends that adults aged ≥65 years preferentially receive any one of the following higher dose or adjuvanted influenza vaccines: quadrivalent high-dose inactivated influenza vaccine (HD-IIV4), quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV4), or quadrivalent adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine (aIIV4). If none of these three vaccines is available at an opportunity for vaccine administration, then any other age-appropriate influenza vaccine should be used. Primary updates to this report include the following two topics: 1) the composition of 2023–24 U.S. seasonal influenza vaccines and 2) updated recommendations regarding influenza vaccination of persons with egg allergy. First, the composition of 2023–24 U.S. influenza vaccines includes an update to the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 component. U.S.-licensed influenza vaccines will contain HA derived from 1) an influenza A/Victoria/4897/2022 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus (for egg-based vaccines) or an influenza A/Wisconsin/67/2022 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus (for cell culture-based and recombinant vaccines); 2) an influenza A/Darwin/9/2021 (H3N2)-like virus (for egg-based vaccines) or an influenza A/Darwin/6/2021 (H3N2)-like virus (for cell culture-based and recombinant vaccines); 3) an influenza B/Austria/1359417/2021 (Victoria lineage)-like virus; and 4) an influenza B/Phuket/3073/2013 (Yamagata lineage)-like virus. Second, ACIP recommends that all persons aged ≥6 months with egg allergy should receive influenza vaccine. Any influenza vaccine (egg based or nonegg based) that is otherwise appropriate for the recipient’s age and health status can be used. It is no longer recommended that persons who have had an allergic reaction to egg involving symptoms other than urticaria should be vaccinated in an inpatient or outpatient medical setting supervised by a health care provider who is able to recognize and manage severe allergic reactions if an egg-based vaccine is used. Egg allergy alone necessitates no additional safety measures for influenza vaccination beyond those recommended for any recipient of any vaccine, regardless of severity of previous reaction to egg. All vaccines should be administered in settings in which personnel and equipment needed for rapid recognition and treatment of acute hypersensitivity reactions are available. This report focuses on recommendations for the use of vaccines for the prevention and control of seasonal influenza during the 2023–24 influenza season in the United States. A brief summary of the recommendations and a link to the most recent Background Document containing additional information are available at: https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/vacc-specific/flu.html. These recommendations apply to U.S.-licensed influenza vaccines used according to Food and Drug Administration–licensed indications. Updates and other information are available from CDC’s influenza website (https://www.cdc.gov/flu). Vaccination and health care providers should check this site periodically for additional information. TopView LargerCloseDownload Image[JPG] Top Introduction Influenza viruses typically circulate annually in the United States, most commonly from the late fall through the early spring. Most persons who become ill after influenza virus infection recover without serious complications or sequelae. However, influenza can be associated with serious illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths, particularly among older adults, very young children, pregnant persons, and persons of all ages with certain chronic medical conditions (1–7). Influenza also is an important cause of missed work and school (8–10). Routine annual influenza vaccination for all persons aged ≥6 months who do not have contraindications has been recommended by CDC and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) since 2010 (11). Vaccination provides important protection from influenza illness and its potential complications. The effectiveness of influenza vaccination varies depending on multiple factors, such as the age and health of the recipient; the type of vaccine administered; the types, subtypes (for influenza A), and lineages (for influenza B) of circulating influenza viruses; and the degree of similarity between circulating viruses and those included in the vaccine (12). During each of the six influenza seasons from 2010–11 through 2015–16, influenza vaccination prevented an estimated 1.6–6.7 million illnesses, 790,000–3.1 million outpatient medical visits, 39,000–87,000 hospitalizations, and 3,000–10,000 respiratory and circulatory deaths each season in the United States (13). During the severe 2017–18 season, notable for an unusually long duration of widespread high influenza activity throughout the United States and higher rates of outpatient visits and hospitalizations compared with recent seasons, vaccination prevented an estimated 7.1 million illnesses, 3.7 million medical visits, 109,000 hospitalizations, and 8,000 deaths (14), despite an overall estimated vaccine effectiveness of 38% (62% against influenza A[H1N1]pdm09 viruses, 22% against influenza A[H3N2] viruses, and 50% against influenza B viruses) (14). Influenza circulated at historically low levels in the United States and globally during the 2020–21 influenza season, coincident with widespread implementation of nonpharmaceutical interventions (e.g., masking, social distancing, and suspension of in-person work and school) intended to prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) (15). The 2021–22 influenza season saw increased activity compared with 2020–21, with influenza activity remaining elevated later into the spring than any previous season for which data are available (16). The 2022–23 season was marked by early influenza activity peaking in late November to early December (17). The timing, intensity, and severity of the 2023–24 influenza season cannot be predicted. Influenza vaccination remains an important tool for the prevention of potentially severe respiratory illness. This report updates the 2022–23 ACIP recommendations regarding the use of seasonal influenza vaccines (18) and provides recommendations and guidance for vaccination providers regarding the use of influenza vaccines in the United States for the 2023–24 season. Various formulations of influenza vaccines are available (Table 1). Contraindications and precautions for the use of influenza vaccines are summarized (Tables 2 and 3). Abbreviations are used in this report to denote the various types of vaccines (Box). A summary of these recommendations and a Background Document containing additional information on influenza, influenza-associated illness, and influenza vaccines are available at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/vacc-specific/flu.html. Top Methods ACIP provides annual recommendations for the use of influenza vaccines for the prevention and control of seasonal influenza in the United States. The ACIP Influenza Work Group meets by teleconference once to twice per month throughout the year. Work Group membership includes multiple voting members of ACIP, representatives of ACIP liaison organizations, and consultants. Discussions include topics such as influenza surveillance, vaccine effectiveness and safety, vaccination coverage, program feasibility, cost effectiveness, and vaccine supply. Presentations are requested from invited experts and published and unpublished data are discussed. The Background Document that supplements this report contains literature related to recommendations made in previous seasons. The information included in the Background Document for such topics is not a systematic review; it is intended to provide an overview of background literature and is periodically updated with articles being identified primarily through a broad search for English-language articles on influenza and influenza vaccines. In general, longstanding recommendations in this document that were made in previous seasons reflect expert opinion, and systematic review and assessment of evidence was not performed. Systematic review and evidence assessment are not performed for minor wording changes to existing recommendations, changes in the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–recommended viral antigen composition of seasonal influenza vaccines, and minor changes in guidance for the use of influenza vaccines (e.g., guidance for timing of vaccination and other programmatic issues, guidance for dosage in specific populations, guidance for selection of vaccines for specific populations that are already recommended for vaccination, and changes that reflect use that is consistent with FDA-licensed indications and prescribing information). Typically, systematic review and evaluation of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach (19) are performed for new recommendations or substantial changes in the current recommendations (e.g., expansion of the recommendation for influenza vaccination to new populations not previously recommended for vaccination or potential preferential recommendations for specific vaccines). Evidence is reviewed with the ACIP influenza Work Group, and Work Group considerations are included within the ACIP Evidence to Recommendations framework (EtR) (20) to inform the development of recommendations that are proposed for vote by the ACIP. Systematic review, GRADE, and the ACIP EtR framework were used in the development of the updated recommendations for influenza vaccination of persons with egg allergy discussed in this report. Top Primary Changes and Updates Primary changes and updates to the recommendations described in this report include 1) the composition of 2023–24 U.S. seasonal influenza vaccines; 2) updated recommendations regarding influenza vaccination of persons with egg allergy. Information relevant to these changes includes the following: The composition of the 2023–24 U.S. seasonal influenza vaccines includes an update to the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 component. For the 2023–24 season, U.S.-licensed influenza vaccines will contain hemagglutinin (HA) derived from 1) an influenza A/Victoria/4897/2022 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus (for egg-based vaccines) or an influenza A/Wisconsin/67/2022 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus (for cell culture-based and recombinant vaccines); 2) an influenza A/Darwin/9/2021 (H3N2)-like virus (for egg-based vaccines) or an influenza A/Darwin/6/2021 (H3N2)-like virus (for cell culture-based and recombinant vaccines); 3) an influenza B/Austria/1359417/2021 (Victoria lineage)-like virus; and 4) an influenza B/Phuket/3073/2013 (Yamagata lineage)-like virus. Recommendations for the composition of Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccines are made by the World Health Organization (WHO), which organizes a consultation, usually in February of each year. Surveillance data are reviewed and candidate vaccine viruses are discussed. Information about the WHO meeting of February 2023 for selection of the 2023–24 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccine composition is available at https://www.who.int/publications/m/itemecommended-composition-of-influenza-virus-vaccines-for-use-in-the-2023-2024-northern-hemisphere-influenza-season. Subsequently, FDA, which has regulatory authority over vaccines in the United States, convenes a meeting of its Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC). This committee considers the recommendations of WHO, reviews and discusses similar data, and makes a final decision regarding the composition of influenza vaccines licensed and marketed in the United States. Materials from the VRBPAC discussion on March 7, 2023, during which the composition of the 2023–24 U.S. influenza vaccines was discussed, are available at https://www.fda.gov/advisory-committees/advisory-committee-calendar/vaccines-and-related-biological-products-advisory-committee-march-7-2023-meeting-announcement. Regarding influenza vaccination of persons with egg allergy, ACIP recommends that all persons aged ≥6 months with egg allergy should receive influenza vaccine. Any influenza vaccine (egg based or nonegg based) that is otherwise appropriate for the recipient’s age and health status can be used. It is no longer recommended that persons who have had an allergic reaction to egg involving symptoms other than urticaria should be vaccinated in an inpatient or outpatient medical setting supervised by a health care provider who is able to recognize and manage severe allergic reactions if an egg-based vaccine is used. Egg allergy alone necessitates no additional safety measures for influenza vaccination beyond those recommended for any recipient of any vaccine, regardless of severity of previous reaction to egg. All vaccines should be administered in settings in which personnel and equipment needed for rapid recognition and treatment of acute hypersensitivity reactions are available. To inform this recommendation, a systematic review and GRADE of evidence concerning safety of influenza vaccination for egg-allergic persons was conducted. A summary of this review and the GRADE evidence tables is available at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acipecs/grade/influenza-egg-allergy.html. A summary of the ACIP EtR framework is available at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acipecs/grade/influenza-egg-allergy-etr.html. Top Recommendations for the Use of Influenza Vaccines, 2023–24 Groups Recommended for Vaccination Routine annual influenza vaccination of all persons aged ≥6 months who do not have contraindications continues to be recommended. Influenza vaccines expected to be available for the 2023–24 season, their age indications, and their presentations are described (Table 1). Available influenza vaccines and age indications are expected to be similar to those of the 2022–23 season. Recommendations regarding timing of vaccination, considerations for specific populations, the use of specific vaccines, and contraindications and precautions are summarized in the sections that follow. Timing of Vaccination Because timing of the onset, peak, and decline of influenza activity varies the ideal time to start vaccinating cannot be predicted each season. Decisions about timing necessitate balancing considerations regarding this unpredictability of the influenza season, possible waning of vaccine-induced immunity over the course of a season, and programmatic considerations. For most persons who need only 1 dose of influenza vaccine for the season, vaccination should ideally be offered during September or October. However, vaccination should continue after October and throughout the influenza season as long as influenza viruses are circulating and unexpired vaccine is available. Influenza vaccines might be available as early as July or August; however, vaccination during these months is not recommended for most groups because of the possible waning of immunity over the course of the influenza season (21–37). However, vaccination of such persons during July and August can be considered in instances where there is concern that the recipient will not be vaccinated at a later date. Considerations for timing of vaccination include the following: For most adults (particularly adults aged ≥65 years) and for pregnant persons in the first or second trimester: Vaccination during July and August should be avoided unless there is concern that vaccination later in the season might not be possible. Children who require 2 doses: Certain children aged 6 months through 8 years require 2 doses of influenza vaccine for the season (see Children Aged 6 Months Through 8 Years: Number of Influenza Vaccine Doses) (Figure). These children should receive their first dose as soon as possible (including during July and August, if vaccine is available) to allow the second dose (which must be administered ≥4 weeks later) to be received, ideally, by the end of October. Children who require only 1 dose: Vaccination during July and August can be considered for children of any age who need only 1 dose of influenza vaccine for the season. Although waning of immunity after vaccination over the course of the season has been observed among all age groups (21–37), there are fewer published studies reporting results specifically among children (21,30,32,33,37). Moreover, children in this group might visit health care providers during the late summer months for medical examinations before the start of school. Vaccination can be considered at this time because it represents a vaccination opportunity. Pregnant persons in the third trimester: Vaccination during July and August can be considered for pregnant persons who are in the third trimester during these months because vaccination has been associated in multiple studies with reduced risk for influenza illness in their infants during the first months after birth, when they are too young to receive influenza vaccine (38–41). For pregnant persons in the first or second trimester during July and August, waiting to vaccinate until September or October is preferable, unless there is concern that later vaccination might not be possible. Community vaccination programs should balance maximizing the likelihood of persistence of vaccine-induced protection through the season with avoiding missed opportunities to vaccinate or vaccinating after onset of influenza circulation occurs. Efforts should be structured to optimize vaccination coverage before influenza activity in the community begins. Vaccination should continue to be offered as long as influenza viruses are circulating and unexpired vaccine is available. To avoid missed opportunities for vaccination, providers should offer vaccination during routine health care visits and hospitalizations. No recommendation is made for revaccination (i.e., providing a booster dose) later in the season of persons who have been fully vaccinated for the season, regardless of when the current season vaccine was received. Optimally, vaccination should occur before onset of influenza activity in the community. However, because timing of the onset, peak, and decline of influenza activity varies, the ideal time to start vaccinating cannot be predicted each season. Moreover, more than one outbreak might occur in a community in a single season. In the United States, localized outbreaks indicating the start of seasonal influenza activity can occur as early as October. However, in 30 (77%) of 39 influenza seasons from 1982–83 through 2021–22, peak influenza activity did not occur until January or later, and in 24 (62%) seasons, the peak was in February or later (42). Activity peaked in February in 17 (44%) of these seasons (42). An increasing number of observational studies (21–37) have reported decreases in vaccine effectiveness with increasing time postvaccination within a single influenza season. Waning effects have not been observed consistently across age groups, influenza viruses (types, subtypes, and lineages), or seasons. Certain studies suggest waning occurs to a greater degree against influenza A(H3N2) viruses than against influenza A(H1N1) or influenza B viruses (25,31,35). This effect also might vary with recipient age; in certain studies, waning was more pronounced among older adults (21,22,24,31,34) and younger children (21). Relatively fewer reports include results specific to children (21,30,32,33,37); findings suggestive of waning have been reported in certain studies (21,32,33,37) but not others (30). Rates of decline in vaccine effectiveness also varied. A multiseason (2011–12 through 2014–15) analysis from the U.S. Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness (U.S. Flu VE) Network found that vaccine effectiveness decreased by approximately 7% per month for influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B and 6%–11% per month for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (23). A prospective test-negative case control study of the 2015–16 through 2019–20 seasons observed an average decline in vaccine effectiveness against influenza-associated hospitalizations of 1.3% per month among children aged ≤8 years and 4.7% per month among those aged 9 through 17 years (37). In the Hospitalized Adult Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network (HAIVEN) during the 2015–16 through 2018–19 seasons, vaccine effectiveness against influenza-associated hospitalizations declined by approximately 8%–9% per month for all adults and approximately 10%–11% per month for those aged ≥65 years (24). An analysis of the 2010–11 through 2013–14 seasons noted estimated effectiveness ranging from 54% to 67% during days 0–180 postvaccination; estimated vaccine effectiveness was not significant during the period between days 181 and 365 (32). A multiseason analysis (2010–11 through 2014–15) conducted in Europe noted a decline in vaccine effectiveness to 0% at 111 days postvaccination against influenza A(H3N2) viruses. Vaccine effectiveness against influenza B viruses decreased more slowly, and vaccine effectiveness against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses remained roughly stable at 50%–55% throughout the influenza season (25). A meta-analysis of 14 studies examining waning of influenza vaccine effectiveness using the test-negative design found a significant decline in effectiveness within 180 days after vaccination against influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B but not against influenza A(H1N1) (43). In addition to the factors observed to be associated with waning immunity across studies, observed decreases in protection might be at least in part attributable to bias, unmeasured confounding, or the late-season emergence of antigenic drift variants of influenza viruses that are less well-matched to the vaccine viruses. Varying data concerning the presence and rate of waning immunity after influenza vaccination, coupled with the unpredictable timing of the influenza season each year, prevent determination of an optimal time to vaccinate each season. Programmatic issues also are a consideration. Although delaying vaccination might result in greater immunity later in the season, deferral also might result in missed opportunities to vaccinate as well as difficulties in vaccinating a population within a more constrained period. The potential contributions of these factors among persons aged ≥65 years have been assessed using a simulated mathematical model examining various scenarios of vaccination timing, timing of onset of the influenza season, vaccine effectiveness, and rate of waning (44). In this model, during an influenza season beginning in October and peaking in January, delaying vaccination until October resulted in more hospitalizations if >14% of persons aged ≥65 years who would have been vaccinated in August or September did not get vaccinated. However, these predictions varied considerably with assumed timing of season onset, rate of waning immunity, and vaccine effectiveness. Vaccination efforts should continue throughout the season because the duration of the influenza season varies, and influenza activity might not occur in certain communities until February, March, or later (17). Providers should offer influenza vaccine at healthcare visits to those not yet vaccinated, and organized vaccination campaigns should continue throughout the influenza season, including after influenza activity has begun in the community. Although vaccination by the end of October is recommended, vaccine administered in December or later, even if influenza activity has already begun, might be beneficial in most influenza seasons. Providers should offer influenza vaccination to unvaccinated persons who have already become ill with influenza during the season because the vaccine might protect them against other circulating influenza viruses. Guidance for Influenza Vaccination in Specific Populations and Situations Populations at Higher Risk for Medical Complications Attributable to Severe Influenza All persons aged ≥6 months who do not have contraindications should be vaccinated annually. However, vaccination to prevent influenza is particularly important for persons who are at increased risk for severe illness and complications from influenza and for influenza-related outpatient, emergency department, or hospital visits. When vaccine supply is limited, vaccination efforts should focus on vaccination of persons at higher risk for medical complications attributable to severe influenza who do not have contraindications. These persons include the following (order of listing does not imply hierarchy or prioritization among these populations): All children aged 6 through 59 months. All persons aged ≥50 years. Adults and children who have chronic pulmonary (including asthma), cardiovascular (excluding isolated hypertension), renal, hepatic, neurologic, hematologic, or metabolic disorders (including diabetes mellitus). Persons who are immunocompromised due to any cause (including but not limited to immunosuppression caused by medications or HIV infection). Persons who are or will be pregnant during the influenza season. Children and adolescents (aged 6 months through 18 years) who are receiving aspirin- or salicylate-containing medications and who might be at risk for experiencing Reye syndrome after influenza virus infection. Residents of nursing homes and other long-term care facilities. American Indian or Alaska Native persons. Persons who are extremely obese (body mass index ≥40 for adults). An age-appropriate IIV4 or RIV4 is suitable for all persons recommended for vaccination, including those in the risk groups listed. LAIV4 is not recommended for certain populations, including certain of these listed groups. Contraindications and precautions for the use of LAIV4 are noted (Table 2). Persons Who Live with or Care for Persons at Higher Risk for Influenza-Related Complications All persons aged ≥6 months without contraindications should be vaccinated annually. However, emphasis also should be placed on vaccination of persons who live with or care for those who are at increased risk for medical complications attributable to severe influenza. When vaccine supply is limited, vaccination efforts should focus on administering vaccination to persons at higher risk for influenza-related complications as well as persons who live with or care for such persons, including the following: Health care personnel, including all paid and unpaid persons working in health care settings who have the potential for exposure to patients or to infectious materials. These personnel might include but are not limited to physicians, nurses, nursing assistants, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, therapists, technicians, emergency medical service personnel, dental personnel, pharmacists, laboratory personnel, autopsy personnel, students and trainees, contractual staff members, and others not directly involved in patient care but who might be exposed to infectious agents (e.g., clerical, dietary, housekeeping, laundry, security, maintenance, administrative, and billing staff members and volunteers). ACIP guidance for vaccination of health care personnel has been published previously (45). Household contacts (including children aged ≥6 months) and caregivers of children aged ≤59 months (<5 years) and adults aged ≥50 years, particularly contacts of children aged <6 months. Household contacts (including children aged ≥6 months) and caregivers of persons with medical conditions that put them at higher risk for severe complications from influenza. Health care personnel and persons who are contacts of persons in these groups (with the exception of contacts of severely immunocompromised persons who require a protected environment) may receive any influenza vaccine that is otherwise indicated. Persons who care for severely immunocompromised persons requiring a protected environment should not receive LAIV4. ACIP and the Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC) have previously recommended that health care personnel who receive LAIV should avoid providing care for severely immunocompromised persons requiring a protected environment for 7 days after vaccination and that hospital visitors who have received LAIV should avoid contact with such persons for 7 days after vaccination (46). However, such persons need not be restricted from caring for or visiting less severely immunocompromised persons. Influenza Vaccination of Persons with COVID-19 Specific data concerning the optimal timing of influenza vaccination of persons with COVID-19 illness are not available. For those who have moderate or severe COVID-19, vaccination should usually be deferred until they have recovered from the acute illness, consistent with General Best Practice Guidelines for Immunization (47). For those with mild or asymptomatic COVID-19, further deferral might be considered to avoid confusing COVID-19 symptoms with potential postvaccination reactions. Other considerations for determination of when to vaccinate include current local influenza activity, the recipient’s individual risk for severe influenza illness, current or recent use of immunosuppressive therapeutic agents that might blunt immune response to vaccines, and risk for exposing others in the vaccination setting to COVID-19. Information concerning precautions for persons with COVID-19 is available at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/duration-isolation.html. Children Aged 6 Through 35 Months: Influenza Vaccine Dose Volumes Five IIV4s are approved for children aged ≥6 months (Table 1). Four of these vaccines are egg based (Afluria Quadrivalent, Fluarix Quadrivalent, FluLaval Quadrivalent, and Fluzone Quadrivalent), and one is cell culture–based (Flucelvax Quadrivalent). For these vaccines, the approved dose volumes for children aged 6 through 35 months are as follows (Table 4): Afluria Quadrivalent: 0.25 mL per dose. However, 0.25-mL prefilled syringes are no longer available. For children aged 6 through 35 months, a 0.25-mL dose must be obtained from a multidose vial (48). Fluarix Quadrivalent: 0.5 mL per dose (49). Flucelvax Quadrivalent: 0.5 mL per dose (50). FluLaval Quadrivalent: 0.5 mL per dose (51). Fluzone Quadrivalent: Either 0.25 mL or 0.5 mL per dose. Per the package insert, each dose may be given at either volume (52); however, 0.25-mL prefilled syringes are no longer available. For all of these IIV4s, persons aged ≥36 months (≥3 years) should receive 0.5 mL per dose. Alternatively, healthy children aged ≥24 months (≥2 years) can receive LAIV4, 0.2 mL intranasally (0.1 mL in each nostril) (53). LAIV4 is not recommended for certain populations and is not approved for children aged <2 years or adults >49 years (see Contraindications and Precautions for the Use of LAIV4) (Table 2). RIV4 is not approved for children aged <18 years (54). High-dose inactivated influenza vaccine (HD-IIV4) (55) and adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine (aIIV4) (56) are not approved for persons aged <65 years. Care should be taken to administer an age-appropriate vaccine at the appropriate volume for each dose. For IIV4s, the recommended volume may be administered from a prefilled syringe containing the appropriate volume (as supplied by the manufacturer), a single-dose vial, or a multidose vial. Single-dose vials should be used for only 1 dose, and multidose vials should be used only for the maximum number of doses specified in the package insert. Any vaccine remaining in a vial after the maximum number of doses has been removed should be discarded, regardless of the volume of the doses obtained or any remaining volume in the vial. Children Aged 6 Months Through 8 Years: Number of Influenza Vaccine Doses Children aged 6 months through 8 years require 2 doses of influenza vaccine administered a minimum of 4 weeks apart during their first season of vaccination for optimal protection (57–60). Determination of the number of doses needed is based on 1) the child’s age at the time of the first dose of 2023–24 influenza vaccine and 2) the number of doses of influenza vaccine received in previous influenza seasons. For children aged 6 months through 8 years, the number of doses of influenza vaccine needed for the 2023–24 influenza season is determined as follows (Figure): Those who have previously received ≥2 total doses of trivalent or quadrivalent influenza vaccine ≥4 weeks apart before July 1, 2023, require only 1 dose for the 2023–24 season. The previous 2 doses of influenza vaccine do not need to have been received in the same season or consecutive seasons. Those who have not previously received ≥2 doses of trivalent or quadrivalent influenza vaccine ≥4 weeks apart before July 1, 2023, or whose previous influenza vaccination history is unknown, require 2 doses for the 2023–24 season. The interval between the 2 doses should be ≥4 weeks. Children aged 6 months through 8 years who require 2 doses of influenza vaccine should receive their first dose as soon as possible (including during July and August, if vaccine is available) to allow the second dose (which must be administered ≥4 weeks later) to be received, ideally, by the end of October. For children aged 8 years who require 2 doses of vaccine, both doses should be administered even if the child turns age 9 years between receipt of dose 1 and dose 2. Adults and children aged ≥9 years need only 1 dose of influenza vaccine for the 2023–24 season. Pregnant Persons Pregnant and postpartum persons have been observed to be at higher risk for severe illness and complications from influenza, particularly during the second and third trimesters. Influenza vaccination during pregnancy is associated with reduced risk for respiratory illness and influenza among pregnant and postpartum persons as well as infants during the first months of life (38–41,61). ACIP and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend that persons who are pregnant or who might be pregnant or postpartum during the influenza season receive influenza vaccine (62). Any licensed, recommended, and age-appropriate IIV4 or RIV4 may be used. LAIV4 should not be used during pregnancy but can be used postpartum. Influenza vaccine can be administered at any time during pregnancy (i.e., during any trimester), before and during the influenza season. Early vaccination (i.e., during July and August) can be considered for persons who are in the third trimester during these months if vaccine is available because this can provide protection for the infant during the first months of life when they are too young to be vaccinated (38–41,61). Although experience with the use of IIVs during pregnancy is substantial, data specifically reflecting administration of influenza vaccines during the first trimester are limited. Most studies have not noted an association between influenza vaccination and adverse pregnancy outcomes, including spontaneous abortion (miscarriage) (63–73). One observational Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) study conducted during the 2010–11 and 2011–12 seasons noted an association between receipt of IIV containing influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and risk for miscarriage in the 28 days after receipt of IIV, when an H1N1pdm09-containing vaccine also had been received the previous season (74). However, in a larger VSD follow-up study, IIV was not associated with an increased risk for miscarriage during the 2012–13, 2013–14, and 2014–15 seasons, regardless of previous season vaccination (75). There is less experience with the use of more recently licensed influenza vaccines (e.g., quadrivalent, cell culture-based, and recombinant vaccines) during pregnancy compared with previously available products. For ccIIV, a review of Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) reports from 2013 through 2020 (76) and a prospective cohort study conducted from 2017 through 2020 (77) did not reveal unexpected safety events among pregnant persons. Data from a randomized clinical trial conducted at Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment (CISA) Project sites comparing the safety of RIV4 versus IIV4 in 382 pregnant persons supported the safety of RIV4 in pregnancy (78). Pregnancy registries and surveillance studies exist for certain products, for which information can be found in package inserts. Older Adults ACIP recommends that adults aged ≥65 years preferentially receive any one of the following higher dose or adjuvanted influenza vaccines: quadrivalent high-dose inactivated influenza vaccine (HD-IIV4), quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV4), or quadrivalent adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine (aIIV4). If none of these three vaccines is available at an opportunity for vaccine administration, then any other age-appropriate influenza vaccine should be administered (79,80). Older adults (aged ≥65 years) are at increased risk for severe influenza-associated illness, hospitalization, and death compared with younger persons (4,17,81). Influenza vaccines are often less effective in this population (82). HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV have been evaluated in comparison with nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs in this age group. Two of these vaccines, HD-IIV and RIV, are higher dose vaccines, which contain an increased dose of HA antigen per virus compared with nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs (60 μg for HD-IIV4 and 45 μg for RIV4, compared with 15 μg for standard-dose inactivated vaccines). The adjuvanted vaccine contains 15 μg of HA per virus, similarly to nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs, but contains the adjuvant MF59. HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV have shown relative benefit compared with SD-IIVs in certain studies, with the most evidence available for HD-IIV3. Randomized efficacy studies comparing these vaccines with nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs against laboratory-confirmed influenza outcomes are few in number (83–85) and cover few influenza seasons. Observational studies, predominantly retrospective cohort studies using diagnostic code–defined (rather than laboratory-confirmed) influenza outcomes, are more numerous and include more influenza seasons (86–96). Certain observational studies have reported relative benefit for HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV in comparison with nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs, particularly in prevention of influenza-associated hospitalizations. The size of this relative benefit has varied from season to season and is not observed in all studies in all seasons, making it difficult to generalize the findings to all or most seasons. Studies directly comparing HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV with one another are few and do not support a conclusion that any one of these vaccines is consistently superior to the others across seasons (86–88,91,97,98). During the 2020–21 season, quadrivalent formulations of high-dose (HD-IIV4) and adjuvanted (aIIV4) influenza vaccines were introduced. Trivalent formulations of these vaccines are no longer available. Data summarizing comparisons of these newer quadrivalent formulations relative to nonadjuvanted SD-IIV4s are limited. In a pragmatic randomized open-label feasibility study of HD-IIV4 compared with SD-IIV4 conducted in Denmark among persons aged 65 through 79 years during the 2021–22 influenza season that collected data from health registries, HD-IIV4 was associated with lower risk for diagnostic code–defined pneumonia and influenza hospitalizations (relative vaccine effectiveness 64.4; 95% CI = 24.4–84.6) (99). Immunocompromised Persons ACIP recommends that persons with compromised immunity (including but not limited to persons with congenital and acquired immunodeficiency states, persons who are immunocompromised due to medications, and persons with anatomic and functional asplenia) should receive an age-appropriate IIV4 or RIV4. ACIP recommends that LAIV4 not be used for these groups because of the uncertain but biologically plausible risk for disease attributable to the live vaccine virus. Use of LAIV4 in persons with these and other conditions is discussed in more detail (see Dosage, Administration, Contraindications, and Precautions) (Table 2). Immunocompromised states comprise a heterogeneous range of conditions with varying risks for severe infections. In many instances, limited data are available regarding the effectiveness of influenza vaccines in the setting of specific immunocompromised states (100). Timing of vaccination might be a consideration (e.g., vaccinating during a period either before or after an immunocompromising intervention). The Infectious Diseases Society of America has published detailed guidance for the selection and timing of vaccines for persons with specific immunocompromising conditions (101). Immune response to influenza vaccines might be blunted in persons with certain conditions, such as congenital immune deficiencies, and in persons receiving cancer chemotherapy, posttransplant regimens, or immunosuppressive medications. Persons with a History of Guillain-Barré Syndrome After Influenza Vaccination A history of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) within 6 weeks of a previous dose of any type of influenza vaccine is considered a precaution for influenza vaccination (Table 2). Persons who are not at higher risk for severe influenza complications (see Populations at Higher Risk for Medical Complications Attributable to Severe Influenza) and who are known to have experienced GBS within 6 weeks of a previous influenza vaccination typically should not be vaccinated. As an alternative to vaccination, providers might consider using influenza antiviral chemoprophylaxis for these persons (102). However, the benefits of influenza vaccination might outweigh the possible risks for certain persons who have a history of GBS within 6 weeks after receipt of influenza vaccine and who also are at higher risk for severe complications from influenza. Persons with a History of Egg Allergy ACIP recommends that all persons aged ≥6 months with egg allergy should receive influenza vaccine. Any influenza vaccine (egg based or nonegg based) that is otherwise appropriate for the recipient’s age and health status can be used (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acipecs/grade/influenza-egg-allergy.html; https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acipecs/grade/influenza-egg-allergy-etr.html). It is no longer recommended that persons who have had an allergic reaction to egg involving symptoms other than urticaria should be vaccinated in an inpatient or outpatient medical setting supervised by a health care provider who is able to recognize and manage severe allergic reactions if an egg-based vaccine is used. Egg allergy alone necessitates no additional safety measures for influenza vaccination beyond those recommended for any recipient of any vaccine, regardless of severity of previous reaction to egg. All vaccines should be administered in settings in which personnel and equipment needed for rapid recognition and treatment of acute hypersensitivity reactions are available. Most available influenza vaccines, with the exceptions of RIV4 (Flublok Quadrivalent, licensed for persons aged ≥18 years) and ccIIV4 (Flucelvax Quadrivalent, licensed for persons aged ≥6 months), are prepared by propagation of virus in embryonated eggs and might contain trace amounts of egg proteins, such as ovalbumin. Among those U.S.-licensed influenza vaccines for which ovalbumin content is reported, quantities are generally small (≤1 μg/0.5mL dose) (Table 1). The Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (AAAAI) and the American College of Allergy, Asthma, & Immunology (ACAAI) have recommended that administration of influenza vaccine to egg allergic persons requires no additional precautions other than those recommended for administration of any vaccine to any individual (103). Since the 2016–17 influenza season, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has recommended that no additional precautionary measures are needed when administering influenza vaccine to egg-allergic persons (104). A review of 20 studies (16 of IIVs, one of virosomal influenza vaccine, and three of LAIV) that examined reactions after administration of seasonal influenza vaccines to egg-allergic persons via either full single-dose or split-dose administration protocols (of which 13 reported inclusion of persons with a history of severe reaction or anaphylaxis to egg) included no reports of anaphylaxis (certainty level: very low) (105–122). Less severe reactions not described as anaphylaxis but involving cardiovascular symptoms, respiratory symptoms, angioedema, or generalized urticaria, or which involved treatment with medications or outpatient or emergency department attention occurred with low frequency (<1%). A similar profile was noted among 13 studies of monovalent H1N1pdm09 influenza vaccine, with no reported instances of anaphylaxis; frequency of reactions involving cardiovascular symptoms, respiratory symptoms, angioedema, or generalized urticaria events of <1%, and of events involving treatment with medications or outpatient or emergency department attention of approximately 1.5% (certainty level: very low) (114,115,123–132). One instance of anaphylaxis meeting a surveillance case definition (i.e., Brighton Level 1 criteria) in a person with possible egg allergy was noted in a summary of VAERS reports after administration of monovalent H1N1pdm09 influenza vaccine during the 2009–10 influenza season; no denominator of doses administered was available but it was noted that approximately 127 million doses of monovalent IIV were distributed in the United States that season (133). Of note, severe allergic reactions after administration of the egg-free vaccine RIV to egg-allergic persons have been noted in VAERS reports (134–136). These reports highlight both the possibility that observed reactions after egg-based influenza vaccines might be caused by substances other than egg proteins and the importance of being prepared to recognize and manage serious hypersensitivity reactions when administering any vaccine to any recipient (regardless of allergy history). Severe and life-threatening reactions to vaccines can rarely occur with any vaccine and in any vaccine recipient, regardless of allergy history. Providers are reminded that all vaccines should be administered in settings in which personnel and equipment needed for rapid recognition and treatment of acute hypersensitivity reactions are available. All vaccination providers should be familiar with their office emergency plan and be certified in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (47). No postvaccination observation period is recommended specifically for egg-allergic persons. However, ACIP recommends that vaccination providers consider observing patients (seated or supine) for 15 minutes after administration of any vaccine to decrease the risk for injury should syncope occur (47). Although egg allergy is neither a contraindication nor precaution to the use of any influenza vaccine, there are contraindications and precautions related to allergies to vaccine components other than egg and to previous allergic reactions to influenza vaccines (see Persons with Previous Allergic Reactions to Influenza Vaccines and Dosage, Administration, Contraindications, and Precautions) (Tables 2 and 3). Persons with Previous Allergic Reactions to Influenza Vaccines As is the case for all vaccines, influenza vaccines contain various components that might cause allergic and anaphylactic reactions. Most influenza vaccine package inserts list among contraindications to their use a history of previous severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component of the vaccine or to a previous dose of any influenza vaccine (48,49,51–53,55,56). For ccIIV4 and RIV4, a history of a severe allergic reaction to any vaccine component is listed as a contraindication; no labeled contraindication is specified for a history of allergic reaction to any other influenza vaccine (50,54). However, severe allergic reactions, although rare, can occur after influenza vaccination, even among persons with no previous reactions or known allergies. Vaccine components and excipients can be found in package inserts. However, identifying the causative agent without further evaluation (i.e., through evaluation and testing for specific allergies) can be difficult. Severe allergic reactions after vaccination with an RIV have been reported to VAERS, certain of which have occurred among persons reporting previous allergic reactions to egg or to influenza vaccines and that might represent a predisposition to development of allergic manifestations in affected persons (134–136). Because these rare but severe allergic reactions can occur, ACIP recommends the following for persons with a history of severe allergic reaction to a previous dose of an influenza vaccine (Table 3): For egg-based IIV4s and LAIV4: A history of severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any influenza vaccine (i.e., any egg-based IIV, ccIIV, RIV, or LAIV of any valency) is a contraindication to future receipt of all egg-based IIV4s and LAIV4. Each individual egg-based IIV4 and LAIV4 is also contraindicated for persons who have had a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component of that vaccine (excluding egg; see Persons with a History of Egg Allergy). For ccIIV4: A history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any egg-based IIV, RIV, or LAIV of any valency is a precaution for the use of ccIIV4. If ccIIV4 is administered in such instances, vaccination should occur in an inpatient or outpatient medical setting and should be supervised by a health care provider who is able to recognize and manage severe allergic reactions. Providers also can consider consultation with an allergist to help determine the vaccine component responsible for the allergic reaction. A history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any ccIIV of any valency or to any component of ccIIV4 is a contraindication to future receipt of ccIIV4. For RIV4: A history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any egg-based IIV, ccIIV, or LAIV of any valency is a precaution for the use of RIV4. If RIV4 is administered in such instances, vaccination should occur in an inpatient or outpatient medical setting and should be supervised by a health care provider who is able to recognize and manage severe allergic reactions. Providers can also consider consultation with an allergist to help determine the vaccine component responsible for the allergic reaction. A history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any RIV of any valency or to any component of RIV4 is a contraindication to future receipt of RIV4. Vaccination Issues for Travelers In temperate climate regions of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, influenza activity is seasonal, occurring during approximately October–May in the Northern Hemisphere and April–September in the Southern Hemisphere. In the tropics, influenza might occur throughout the year (137). The timing of influenza activity and predominant types and subtypes of influenza viruses in circulation vary by geographic region (138). Travelers can be exposed to influenza when traveling to an area where influenza is circulating or when traveling as part of large tourist groups (e.g., on cruise ships) that include persons from areas of the world where influenza viruses are circulating (139–142). Travelers who want to reduce their risk for influenza should consider influenza vaccination, preferably at least 2 weeks before departure. In particular, persons who live in the United States and are at higher risk for influenza complications and who were not vaccinated with influenza vaccine during the previous Northern Hemisphere fall or winter should consider receiving influenza vaccination before departure if they plan to travel to the tropics, to the Southern Hemisphere during the Southern Hemisphere influenza season (April–September), or with organized tourist groups or on cruise ships to any location. Persons at higher risk who received the previous season’s influenza vaccine before travel should consult with their health care provider to discuss the risk for influenza and other travel-related diseases before embarking on travel during the summer. All persons (regardless of risk status) who are vaccinated in preparation for travel before the upcoming influenza season’s vaccine is available, or who received the immediately preceding Southern Hemisphere influenza vaccine, should receive the current U.S. seasonal influenza vaccine the following fall or winter. Influenza vaccine formulated for the Southern Hemisphere might differ in viral composition from the Northern Hemisphere vaccine. For persons traveling to the Southern Hemisphere during the Southern Hemisphere influenza season, receipt of a current U.S.-licensed Southern Hemisphere influenza vaccine formulation before departure might be reasonable but might not be feasible because of limited access to or unavailability of Southern Hemisphere formulations in the United States. Most Southern Hemisphere influenza vaccine formulations are not licensed in the United States, and they are typically not commercially available. More information on influenza vaccines and travel is available at https://wwwnc.cdc.govravel/diseases/influenza-seasonal-zoonotic-and-pandemic. Additional information on global influenza surveillance by region is available at https://www.who.intools/flunet. Use of Influenza Antiviral Medications Administration of any IIV4 or RIV4 to persons receiving influenza antiviral medications for treatment or chemoprophylaxis of influenza is acceptable. Data concerning vaccination with LAIV4 in the setting of influenza antiviral use are not available. However, influenza antiviral medications might interfere with the action of LAIV4 because this vaccine contains live influenza viruses. The package insert for LAIV4 notes that influenza antiviral agents might reduce the effectiveness of the vaccine if administered within the interval from 48 hours before to 14 days after vaccination (53). However, the newer influenza antivirals peramivir and baloxavir have longer half-lives than oseltamivir and zanamivir, approximately 20 hours for peramivir (143) and 79 hours for baloxavir (144), and could interfere with the replication of LAIV4, if administered >48 hours before vaccination. Potential interactions between influenza antivirals and LAIV4 have not been studied, and the ideal intervals between administration of these medications and LAIV4 are not known. Assuming a period of at least 5 half-lives for substantial decrease in drug levels (145), a reasonable assumption is that that peramivir might interfere with the mechanism of LAIV4 if administered from 5 days before through 2 weeks after vaccination and baloxavir might interfere if administered from 17 days before through 2 weeks after vaccination. The interval between influenza antiviral receipt and LAIV4 during which interference might occur could be further prolonged in the presence of medical conditions that delay medication clearance (e.g., renal insufficiency). Persons who receive these medications during these periods before or after receipt of LAIV4 should be revaccinated with another appropriate influenza vaccine (e.g., IIV4 or RIV4). Administration of Influenza Vaccines with Other Vaccines IIV4s and RIV4 can be administered simultaneously or sequentially with other inactivated vaccines or live vaccines. Injectable vaccines that are given concomitantly should be administered at separate anatomic sites. COVID-19 vaccines that are administered at the same time as influenza vaccines that might be more likely to be associated with local injection site reactions (e.g., HD-IIV4 and aIIV4) should be given in different limbs, if possible. LAIV4 can be administered simultaneously with other live or inactivated vaccines. However, if two live vaccines are not given simultaneously, at least 4 weeks should pass after administration of one live vaccine (such as LAIV4) before another live vaccine is administered (47). In recent years, multiple vaccines containing nonaluminum adjuvants have been licensed for use in the United States for the prevention of various infectious diseases. Examples include AS01B (in Shingrix, recombinant zoster subunit vaccine) (146), AS01E (in start highlightArexvyend highlight, respiratory syncytial virus vaccine) (147) MF59 (in Fluad Quadrivalent [aIIV4]) (56), and cytosine phosphoguanine oligodeoxynucleotide (in Heplisav-B, a recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen vaccine) (148). Data are limited regarding coadministration of these vaccines with other adjuvanted or nonadjuvanted vaccines, including COVID-19 vaccines. Coadministration of Shingrix with nonadjuvanted IIV4 has been studied, and no evidence of decreased immunogenicity or safety concerns was noted (149). Data on the immunogenicity and safety of simultaneous or sequential administration of two nonaluminum adjuvant–containing vaccines are limited, and the ideal interval between such vaccines when given sequentially is not known. In the study of Shingrix and IIV4 (149), most reactogenicity symptoms resolved within 4 days. Because of the limited data on the safety of simultaneous administration of two or more vaccines containing nonaluminum adjuvants and the availability of nonadjuvanted influenza vaccine options, selection of a nonadjuvanted influenza vaccine may be considered in situations in which influenza vaccine and another vaccine containing a nonaluminum adjuvant are to be administered concomitantly. However, influenza vaccination should not be delayed if a specific vaccine is not available. As recommended for all vaccines, vaccines with nonaluminum adjuvants should be administered at separate anatomic sites from other vaccines that are given concomitantly (47). For more recently introduced and new vaccines (e.g., respiratory syncytial virus [RSV] vaccine) data informing simultaneous administration with influenza vaccines might be limited or evolving. Providers should consult current CDC/ACIP recommendations and guidance for up-to-date information. Top Influenza Vaccine Composition and Available Vaccines Influenza Vaccine Composition for the 2023–24 Season All influenza vaccines licensed in the United States will contain components derived from influenza viruses antigenically similar to those recommended by FDA (https://www.fda.gov/advisory-committees/advisory-committee-calendar/vaccines-and-related-biological-products-advisory-committee-march-7-2023-meeting-announcement). All influenza vaccines expected to be available in the United States for the 2023–24 season will be quadrivalent vaccines. For the 2023–24 season, U.S. egg-based influenza vaccines (i.e., vaccines other than ccIIV4 and RIV4) will contain HA derived from an influenza A/Victoria/4897/2022 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus, an influenza A/Darwin/9/2021 (H3N2)-like virus, an influenza B/Austria/1359417/2021 (Victoria lineage)-like virus, and an influenza B/Phuket/3073/2013 (Yamagata lineage)-like virus. For the 2023–24 season, U.S. cell culture–based inactivated (ccIIV4) and recombinant (RIV4) influenza vaccines will contain HA derived from an influenza A/Wisconsin/67/2022 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus, an influenza A/Darwin/6/2021 (H3N2)-like virus, an influenza B/Austria/1359417/2021 (Victoria lineage)-like virus, and an influenza B/Phuket/3073/2013 (Yamagata lineage)-like virus. Vaccines Available for the 2023–24 Season Availability of specific types and brands of licensed seasonal influenza vaccines in the United States is determined by the manufacturers of the vaccines. Information presented concerning vaccines expected to be available and their approved indications and usage reflects current knowledge and is subject to change. Various influenza vaccines will be available for the 2023–24 season (Table 1). For many vaccine recipients, more than one type or brand of vaccine might be appropriate within approved indications and ACIP recommendations. A licensed influenza vaccine that is appropriate for the recipient’s age and health status should be used. Specific age indications for licensed influenza vaccines are summarized (Table 1). Current prescribing information should be consulted for authoritative, up-to-date information. Contraindications and precautions for the different types of influenza vaccines are summarized (Tables 2 and 3), as are dose volumes (Table 4). Not all influenza vaccines are likely to be uniformly available in any specific practice setting or geographic locality. Vaccination should not be delayed to obtain a specific product when an appropriate one is available. Within these guidelines and approved indications, ACIP makes no preferential recommendation for the use of any one influenza vaccine over another when more than one licensed, recommended, and age-appropriate vaccine is available, with the exception of selection of influenza vaccines for persons aged ≥65 years (see Older Adults). Dosage, Administration, Contraindications, and Precautions Quadrivalent Inactivated Influenza Vaccines (IIV4s) Available Vaccines. As in recent seasons, various inactivated influenza vaccines (IIVs) are expected to be available for 2023–24 (Table 1); all are expected to be quadrivalent (IIV4s). Standard-dose, nonadjuvanted IIV4s are licensed for persons aged as young as 6 months. However, for certain IIV4s, the approved dose volume for children aged 6 through 35 months differs from that for older children and adults (Table 4). Two IIV4s, the MF59-adjuvanted IIV4 (aIIV4) and the high-dose IIV4 (HD-IIV4), are approved only for persons aged ≥65 years. Care should be taken to administer the appropriate dose volume of an age-appropriate vaccine to each recipient. Standard-dose, nonadjuvanted IIV4s contain 15 μg of HA per vaccine virus in a 0.5-mL dose (7.5 μg of HA per vaccine virus in a 0.25-mL dose). For 2023–24, this category is expected to include five different vaccines (Table 1). Four of these are egg-based vaccines, and one is a cell culture–based vaccine (Flucelvax Quadrivalent [ccIIV4]). All are approved for persons aged ≥6 months. Egg-based and cell culture–based vaccines differ in the substrate in which reference vaccine viruses supplied to the manufacturer are propagated in quantities sufficient to produce the needed number of doses of vaccine. For the IIV4s Afluria Quadrivalent (48), Fluarix Quadrivalent (49), FluLaval Quadrivalent (51), and Fluzone Quadrivalent (52), reference vaccine viruses are propagated in eggs. For Flucelvax Quadrivalent (ccIIV4), reference vaccine viruses are propagated in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells instead of eggs (50). Two additional IIV4s that will be available for the 2023–24 season are approved only for persons aged ≥65 years. These vaccines are egg based. Quadrivalent high-dose inactivated influenza vaccine (Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent; HD-IIV4) contains 60 μg of HA per vaccine virus (240 μg total) in a 0.7-mL dose (55). Quadrivalent adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine (Fluad Quadrivalent; aIIV4) contains 15 μg of HA per vaccine virus (60 μg total) and MF59 adjuvant (56). Dosage and Administration. Standard-dose nonadjuvanted IIV4s are approved for children aged as young as 6 months. Certain of these IIV4s are approved at different dose volumes for very young children than for older children and adults. Care should be taken to administer an age-appropriate vaccine at the approved dose volume for each needed dose (see Children Aged 6 Through 35 Months: Influenza Vaccine Dose Volumes) (Tables 1 and 4): Afluria Quadrivalent: The approved dose volume for children aged 6 through 35 months is 0.25 mL per dose. Persons aged ≥36 months (≥3 years) should receive 0.5 mL per dose (48). Fluarix Quadrivalent: The approved dose volume is 0.5 mL per dose for all persons aged ≥6 months (49). Flucelvax Quadrivalent: The approved dose volume is 0.5 mL per dose for all persons aged ≥6 months (50). FluLaval Quadrivalent: The approved dose volume is 0.5 mL per dose for all persons aged ≥6 months (51). Fluzone Quadrivalent: The approved dose volume for children aged 6 through 35 months is either 0.25 mL or 0.5 mL per dose. Persons aged ≥36 months (≥3 years) should receive 0.5 mL per dose (52). If prefilled syringes are not available, the appropriate volume can be administered from a single-dose or multidose vial. If a 0.5-mL single-dose vial is used for a 0.25-mL dose for a child aged 6 through 35 months, only one half of the vial volume should be administered, and the remaining one half should be discarded. Of note, dose volume is distinct from the number of doses. Children in this age group who require 2 doses for 2023–24 need 2 separate doses administered ≥4 weeks apart, regardless of the specific IIV4 used and volume given for each dose (see Children Aged 6 Months Through 8 Years: Number of Influenza Vaccine Doses) (Figure). For children aged 36 months (3 years) through 17 years and adults aged ≥18 years, the dose volume for IIV4s is 0.5 mL per dose, with the exception of Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent (HD-IIV4, licensed for persons aged ≥65 years), for which the correct volume is 0.7 mL per dose. If a smaller vaccine dose (e.g., 0.25 mL) is inadvertently administered to a person aged ≥36 months, the remaining volume needed to make a full dose should be administered during the same vaccination visit or, if measuring the needed remaining volume is a challenge, administering a repeat dose at the full volume is acceptable. If the error is discovered later (after the recipient has left the vaccination setting), a full dose should be administered as soon as the recipient can return. Vaccination with a formulation approved for adult use should be counted as a single dose if inadvertently administered to a child. IIV4s are administered intramuscularly (IM). For adults and older children, the deltoid muscle is the preferred site. Infants and younger children should be vaccinated in the anterolateral thigh. Additional specific guidance regarding site selection and needle length for IM injection is provided in the General Best Practice Guidelines for Immunization (47). One IIV4, Afluria Quadrivalent, is licensed for IM injection via the PharmaJet Stratis jet injector for persons aged 18 through 64 years (48). Persons in this age group may receive Afluria Quadrivalent via either needle and syringe or this specific jet injection device. Children aged 6 months through 17 years and adults aged ≥65 years should receive this vaccine by needle and syringe only. No other IIV4s are licensed for administration by jet injector. Contraindications and Precautions for the Use of IIV4s. Manufacturer package inserts and updated CDC and ACIP guidance should be consulted for information on contraindications and precautions for individual influenza vaccines. Each IIV, whether egg based or cell culture based, has a labeled contraindication for persons with a history of a severe allergic reaction to any component of that vaccine (Tables 2 and 3). However, although egg is a component of all IIV4s other than ccIIV4, ACIP makes specific recommendations for the use of influenza vaccine for persons with egg allergy (see Persons with a History of Egg Allergy). All egg-based IIV4s are contraindicated in persons who have had a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to a previous dose of any influenza vaccine (any egg-based IIV, ccIIV, RIV, or LAIV of any valency). Use of ccIIV4 is contraindicated in persons who have had a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any ccIIV of any valency. A history of severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any other influenza vaccine (i.e., any egg-based IIV, RIV, or LAIV of any valency) is a precaution for the use of ccIIV4 (see Persons with Previous Allergic Reactions to Influenza Vaccines) (Tables 2 and 3). If ccIIV4 is administered in such an instance, vaccination should occur in an inpatient or outpatient medical setting and should be supervised by a health care provider who is able to recognize and manage severe allergic reactions. Providers can also consider consultation with an allergist to help identify the vaccine component responsible for the reaction. Information about vaccine components can be found in the package inserts for each vaccine. Prophylactic use of antiviral agents is an option that can be considered for preventing influenza among persons who cannot receive vaccine, particularly for those who are at higher risk for medical complications attributable to severe influenza (102). Moderate or severe acute illness with or without fever is a general precaution for vaccination (47). A history of GBS within 6 weeks after receipt of a previous dose of influenza vaccine is considered a precaution for the use of all influenza vaccines (Table 2). Quadrivalent Recombinant Influenza Vaccine (RIV4) Available Vaccine. One recombinant influenza vaccine, Flublok Quadrivalent (RIV4), is expected to be available during the 2023–24 influenza season. RIV4 is approved for persons aged ≥18 years. This vaccine contains recombinant HA produced in an insect cell line using genetic sequences from cell-derived influenza viruses and is manufactured without the use of influenza viruses or eggs (54). Dosage and Administration. RIV4 is administered by IM injection via needle and syringe. A 0.5-mL dose contains 45 μg of HA derived from each vaccine virus (180 μg total). Contraindications and Precautions for the Use of RIV4. Manufacturer package inserts and updated CDC and ACIP guidance should be consulted for information on contraindications and precautions for individual influenza vaccines. RIV4 is contraindicated in persons who have had a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to a previous dose of any RIV of any valency or to any component of RIV4. A history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any other influenza vaccine (i.e., any egg-based IIV, ccIIV, or LAIV of any valency) is a precaution for the use of RIV4. If RIV4 is administered in such an instance, vaccination should occur in an inpatient or outpatient medical setting and should be supervised by a health care provider who is able to recognize and manage severe allergic reactions. Providers can also consider consulting with an allergist to help identify the vaccine component responsible for the reaction (Tables 2 and 3). Moderate or severe acute illness with or without fever is a general precaution for vaccination (47). A history of GBS within 6 weeks after receipt of a previous dose of influenza vaccine is considered a precaution for the use of all influenza vaccines (Table 2). RIV4 is not licensed for children aged <18 years. Quadrivalent Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV4) Available Vaccine. One live attenuated influenza vaccine, FluMist Quadrivalent (LAIV4), is expected to be available during the 2023–24 influenza season. LAIV4 is approved for persons aged 2 through 49 years. LAIV4 contains live attenuated influenza viruses that are propagated in eggs. These viruses are cold adapted (so that they replicate efficiently at 25°C [77°F]) and temperature sensitive (so that their replication is restricted at higher temperatures, 39°C [102.2°F] for influenza A viruses and 37°C [98.6°] for influenza B viruses). The live attenuated vaccine viruses replicate in the nasopharynx, which is necessary to promote an immune response (53). No preference is expressed for LAIV4 versus other influenza vaccines used within specified indications. Dosage and Administration. LAIV4 is administered intranasally using the supplied prefilled, single-use sprayer containing 0.2 mL of vaccine. Approximately 0.1 mL (i.e., one half of the total sprayer contents) is sprayed into the first nostril while the recipient is in the upright position. An attached dose-divider clip is removed from the sprayer to permit administration of the second half of the dose into the other nostril. Sniffing of the dose is not necessary. If the recipient sneezes immediately after administration, the dose should not be repeated. However, if nasal congestion is present that might impede delivery of the vaccine to the nasopharyngeal mucosa, deferral of administration should be considered until resolution of the illness, or another appropriate vaccine should be administered instead. Each total dose of 0.2 mL contains 106.5–7.5 fluorescent focus units of each vaccine virus (53). Contraindications and Precautions for the Use of LAIV4. Manufacturer package inserts and updated CDC and ACIP guidance should be consulted for information on contraindications and precautions for individual influenza vaccines. Conditions considered by ACIP to be contraindications and precautions for the use of LAIV4 are summarized (Table 2). These include two labeled contraindications that appear in the package insert (53) and other conditions for which there is either uncertain but biologically plausible potential risk associated with live viruses or limited data for use of LAIV. Contraindications to use of LAIV4 include the following (Tables 2 and 3): Severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component of the vaccine or to a previous dose of any influenza vaccine (i.e., any egg-based IIV, ccIIV, RIV, or LAIV of any valency; a labeled contraindication noted in the package insert). However, although egg is a component of LAIV4, ACIP makes specific recommendations for the use of influenza vaccine for persons with egg allergy (see Persons with a History of Egg Allergy). Children and adolescents receiving concomitant aspirin- or salicylate-containing medications, because of the potential risk for Reye syndrome (a labeled contraindication noted in the package insert). Children aged 2 through 4 years who have received a diagnosis of asthma or whose parents or caregivers report that a health care provider has told them during the preceding 12 months that their child had wheezing or asthma or whose medical record indicates a wheezing episode has occurred during the preceding 12 months. Children and adults who are immunocompromised due to any cause, including but not limited to immunosuppression caused by medications, congenital or acquired immunodeficiency states, HIV infection, anatomic asplenia, or functional asplenia (such as that due to sickle cell anemia). Close contacts and caregivers of severely immunosuppressed persons who require a protected environment. Pregnancy. Persons with active communication between the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the oropharynx, nasopharynx, nose, or ear or any other cranial CSF leak. Persons with cochlear implants, because of the potential for CSF leak that might exist for a period after implantation (providers might consider consultation with a specialist concerning the risk for persistent CSF leak if an age-appropriate inactivated or recombinant vaccine cannot be used). Receipt of influenza antiviral medication within the previous 48 hours for oseltamivir and zanamivir, previous 5 days for peramivir, and previous 17 days for baloxavir. The interval between influenza antiviral receipt and LAIV4 during which interference might potentially occur might be further prolonged in the presence of medical conditions that delay medication clearance (e.g., renal insufficiency). Precautions to the use of LAIV4 include the following (Tables 2 and 3): Moderate or severe acute illness with or without fever. History of GBS within 6 weeks after receipt of any influenza vaccine. Asthma in persons aged ≥5 years. Other underlying medical condition (other than those listed under contraindications) that might predispose to complications after wild-type influenza virus infection (e.g., chronic pulmonary, cardiovascular [except isolated hypertension], renal, hepatic, neurologic, hematologic, or metabolic disorders [including diabetes mellitus]). Top Storage and Handling of Influenza Vaccines In all instances, approved manufacturer packaging information should be consulted for authoritative guidance concerning storage and handling of specific influenza vaccines. Typically, influenza vaccines should be protected from light and stored at temperatures that are recommended in the package insert. Recommended storage temperatures are typically 36°F–46°F (2°C–8°C) and should be maintained at all times with adequate refrigeration and temperature monitoring. Vaccine that has frozen should be discarded. Specific recommendations for appropriate refrigerators and temperature monitoring equipment can be found in the Vaccine Storage and Handling Toolkit, available at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/admin/storageoolkit/index.html. Vaccines should not be used beyond the expiration date on the label. In addition to the expiration date, multidose vials also might have a beyond-use date (BUD), which specifies the number of days the vaccine can be kept once first accessed. After being accessed for the first dose, multidose vials should not be used after the BUD. If no BUD is provided, then the listed expiration date is to be used. Multidose vials should be returned to recommended storage conditions between uses. Package information might also specify a maximum number of doses contained in multidose vials (regardless of remaining volume). No more than the specified number of doses should be removed, and any remainder should be discarded. Single-dose vials should not be accessed for more than 1 dose. Providers should contact the manufacturer for information on permissible temperature excursions and other departures from recommended storage and handling conditions that are not discussed in the package labeling. Top Additional Sources of Information Regarding Influenza and Influenza Vaccines Influenza Surveillance, Prevention, and Control Updated information regarding influenza surveillance, detection, prevention, and control is available at https://www.cdc.gov/flu. U.S. surveillance data are updated weekly throughout the year on FluView (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly) and can be viewed in FluView Interactive (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/fluviewinteractive.htm). In addition, periodic updates regarding influenza are published in MMWR (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/index.html). Additional information regarding influenza and influenza vaccines can be obtained from CDCINFO by calling 1-800-232-4636. State and local health departments should be consulted about availability of influenza vaccines, access to vaccination programs, information related to state or local influenza activity, reporting of influenza outbreaks and influenza-related pediatric deaths, and advice concerning outbreak control. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 requires health care providers to report any adverse event listed by the vaccine manufacturer as a contraindication to future doses of the vaccine or any adverse event listed in the VAERS Table of Reportable Events Following Vaccination (https://vaers.hhs.gov/docs/VAERS_Table_of_Reportable_Events_Following_Vaccination.pdf) that occurs within the specified period after vaccination. In addition to mandated reporting, health care providers are encouraged to report any clinically significant adverse event after vaccination to VAERS. Information on how to report a vaccine adverse event is available at https://vaers.hhs.gov/index.html. National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP), established by the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986, as amended, is a no-fault alternative to the traditional tort system. It provides compensation to people found to be injured by certain vaccines. VICP covers most vaccines routinely given in the United States. The Vaccine Injury Table (https://www.hrsa.gov/sites/default/files/hrsa/vicp/vaccine-injury-table-01-03-2022.pdf) lists the vaccines covered by VICP and the associated injuries and conditions that might receive a legal presumption of causation. If the injury or condition is not in the table or does not meet the requirements in the table, persons must prove that the vaccine caused the injury or condition. Claims must be filed within specified time frames. Persons of all ages who receive a VICP-covered vaccine might be eligible to file a claim. Additional information is available at https://www.hrsa.gov/vaccine-compensation or by calling 1-800-338-2382.

Helen Keipp Talbot reports receiving financial support from CDC. Among Work Group members, Edward Belongia receives support from Seqirus as a co-investigator in a study of influenza vaccine effectiveness. Thomas Boyce receives support from GlaxoSmithKline for work in a study of respiratory syncytial virus epidemiology. No other potential conflicts of interest were disclosed. This report includes discussion of the unlabeled use of influenza vaccines in the instance of influenza vaccination of persons with a history of egg allergy. A history of severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to the vaccine or any of its components (which include egg for certain vaccines) is a labeled contraindication to receipt of most IIV4s and LAIV4. However, ACIP recommends that all persons aged ≥6 months with egg allergy should receive influenza vaccine. Any influenza vaccine (egg based or nonegg based) that is otherwise appropriate for the recipient’s age and health status can be used. Top CDC Adoption of ACIP Recommendations for MMWR Recommendations and Reports, MMWR Policy Notes, and Immunization Schedules (Child/Adolescent, Adult) Recommendations for routine use of vaccines in children, adolescents, and adults are developed by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). ACIP is chartered as a Federal Advisory Committee to provide expert external advice and guidance to the Director of CDC on use of vaccines and related agents for the control of vaccine preventable diseases in the civilian population of the United States. Recommendations for routine use of vaccines in children and adolescents are harmonized to the greatest extent possible with recommendations made by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). Recommendations for routine use of vaccinations in adults are harmonized with recommendations of AAFP, ACOG, and the American College of Physicians (ACP). ACIP recommendations are forwarded to CDC’s Director and once adopted become official CDC policy. These recommendations are then published in CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR).

Providers can consider consultation with an allergist in such cases to assist in identification of the component responsible for the allergic reaction. ** Age-appropriate injectable vaccines are recommended for persons with cochlear implant because of the potential for CSF leak, which might exist for a period after implantation. Providers might consider consultation with a specialist concerning risk for persistent CSF leak if an age-appropriate inactivated or recombinant vaccine cannot be used. †† Use of LAIV4 in context of influenza antivirals has not been studied; however, interference with activity of LAIV4 is biologically plausible, and this possibility is noted in the package insert for LAIV4. In the absence of data supporting an adequate minimum interval between influenza antiviral use and LAIV4 administration, the intervals provided are based on the half-life of each antiviral. The interval between influenza antiviral receipt and LAIV4 for which interference might potentially occur might be further prolonged in the presence of medical conditions that delay medication clearance (e.g., renal insufficiency). Influenza antivirals might also interfere with LAIV4 if initiated within 2 weeks after vaccination. Persons who receive antivirals during the period starting with the specified time before receipt of LAIV4 through 2 weeks after receipt of LAIV4 should be revaccinated with an age-appropriate IIV or RIV4.

Instead, the ability of antibodies to leverage the antiviral power of the innate immune system has been implicated in protection from and clearance of influenza infection. Here, post-hoc analysis of the humoral immune response to influenza is comprehensively profiled in a cohort of vaccinated older adults (65 + ) monitored for influenza infection during the 2012/2013 season in the United States (NCT: 01427309). While robust humoral immune responses arose against the vaccine and circulating strains, influenza-specific antibody effector profiles differed in individuals that later became infected with influenza, who are deficient in NK cell activating antibodies to both hemagglutinin and neuraminidase, compared to individuals who remained uninfected. Furthermore, NK cell activation was strongly associated with the NK cell senescence marker CD57, arguing for the need for selective induction of influenza-specific afucosylated NK activating antibodies in older adults to achieve protection. High dose vaccination, currently used for older adults, was insufficient to generate this NK cell-activating humoral response. Next generation vaccines able to selectively bolster NK cell activating antibodies may be required to achieve protection in the setting of progressively senescent NK cells.

Older adults suffer from a disproportionate burden of severe disease and hospitalization following influenza infection, even in the setting of broad vaccine campaigns2. While seasonal vaccination has resulted in a 40% reduction in hospitalizations in this vulnerable population3, the current vaccines are estimated to provide between 10 and 60% protection annually4. During the 2012-2013 influenza season, the vaccine achieved a respectable 52% protection against medically-attended acute respiratory disease across all age groups, albeit with lower efficacy in people 65 and older5. Correlate analyses observed that hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) accounted for only ~60% of the observed protection6,7,8, pointing to the importance of additional, non-HAI vaccine mechanisms as additional correlates of immunity. Moreover, given the mismatch in the H3N2 vaccine antigen and the circulating strain during the 2012–2013 season9 that resulted in compromised neutralization, it was highly likely that alternate, non-neutralizing, vaccine-induced immune mechanisms played a critical role as contributors to protection. Thus, the 2012-2013 season offered a unique opportunity to define correlates of immunity against influenza beyond neutralization.The identification of broadly reactive monoclonal antibodies, such as CR626110 and CR911411, that provide robust in vivo protection12,13 even in the absence of neutralization have raised the possibility that additional humoral mechanisms beyond neutralization may be critical for immunity against influenza14,15,16. Several antibody-effector functions have been implicated in protection from influenza infection16, including antibody-mediated macrophage phagocytosis17,18, neutrophil activation17, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC)19 by NK cells, monocytes, and neutrophils, and complement-specific lysis18,20,21,22. Hemagglutinin (HA)-specific functional antibodies capable of inducing ADCC arise early following infection and exhibit more breadth of binding compared to neutralizing antibodies23, and have been shown to decrease symptom severity and increase viral clearance24. Furthermore, in older adults, increased ADCC activity correlated with strong HAI responses following vaccination25, although HAI antibodies have been proposed to compete with ADCC antibodies for access to antigenic epitopes26. However, whether ADCC alone is critical for protection, or whether ADCC antibodies work in tandem with other antibody-effector functions to provide maximal protection from infection, remains incompletely understood.To objectively begin to define the functional humoral correlates of immunity against influenza, we deeply profiled the functional humoral immune response to influenza at 28 days post immunization in a unique cohort of vaccinated older adults sampled and monitored during the 2012–2013 season8. Influenza-specific antibody-effector profiles at peak immunogenicity were markedly different between individuals that later became infected with influenza. Individuals who became infected had responses marked by a highly selective deficit of NK cell activating antibodies to both the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) antigens of H3N2 influenza, compared to the individuals who remained uninfected. Linked to the observed progressive loss of ADCC activity in older adults, the data presented here provide strong evidence for a preferential and critical role for Fc-afucosylated NK cell-recruiting antibodies in protection against influenza in the elderly. Thus, next-generation vaccines able to selectively bolster NK cell-activating antibodies may be required to achieve protection in the setting of progressively senescent NK cells.ResultsProtected vaccinees induce coordinated humoral immune responsesOlder adults (≥65 years old) were enrolled in the FIM12 efficacy trial8,27 and immunized with either a regular or high-dose trivalent influenza vaccine in October of 2012. Serum samples were collected 28 days post vaccination. No baseline samples were collected; therefore, all samples reflect both vaccine-induced and previously occurring immunity. All vaccinees were tracked throughout the influenza season, with twice weekly surveillance calls during the peak of the influenza season (January-February 2013), followed by once weekly calls until the end of the season (30 April 2013). Any individuals with respiratory illness were tested for influenza by PCR, culture, or both. The majority of influenza-positive individuals were infected with influenza A subtype H3N2. No individuals with respiratory symptoms who tested negative for influenza were included in this study set. A small number (n = 5) of individuals who displayed respiratory symptoms yet did not meet clinical criteria for influenza-like illness but had influenza viral infections detected by PCR and/or culture were included. Samples from all available cases and a set of controls, matched for age, sex, and vaccine dose, were included in this study8 (Table S1).In line with previous studies pointing to an incomplete association between HAI and protection6,7,8, individuals who did not become infected during the study period (controls) trended toward higher post vaccination and pre-infection HAI titers towards the circulating H3N2 strain compared to the individuals who later became infected (cases), although this difference was not significant (p = 0.075, Fig. 1A). No differences were observed between HAI titers for other vaccine strains (Figure S1A, B). Additionally, no difference was observed in overall serum IgG titers against HA and NA from the circulating H3N2 strain (Fig. 1B). Importantly, differences in the magnitude of the antibody response were noted in overall vaccine-induced profiles across the vaccine antigen and circulating strain antigen (Figure S1C), which differed at three amino acids in the HA protein due to egg adaptation of both the regular and high-dose vaccine during this season9,28, responses were highly correlated across H3N2 vaccine and circulating antigens (Figure S1D). These data suggested that alternate humoral qualities, beyond HAI and HA-specific binding titers, are likely associated with protection.Fig. 1: Protected vaccine recipients show coordinated humoral immune response.Serum samples, day 28 post vaccination, were analyzed for HAI, influenza-specific antibody levels, and influenza-specific antibody-mediated innate immune functionality.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageTo gain a deeper sense of additional antibody correlates of immunity, systems serology29 was utilized to measure antigen-specific antibody-dependent innate immune functions (Antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis, ADCP; Antibody-dependent neutrophil phagocytosis, ADNP; Antibody-dependent complement deposition, ADCD; Antibody-dependent NK cell activation, ADNKA CD107a, IFN-γ, and MIP-1β; and Antibody-dependent DC phagocytosis, ADDCP CD83, and HLA-DR expression), antigen-specific antibody isotype titers, and antigen-specific Fcγ-receptor (FCGR) binding profiles at peak immunogenicity. All samples were profiled under blinded conditions, and researchers were unblinded for analysis once all data was collected. Serum samples from pre-vaccination timepoints were unavailable, thus antibody profiles described here reflect both vaccine-induced and naturally occurring humoral immune responses. Antibody Fc profiling across the cases and controls highlighted significant heterogeneity in vaccine-induced H3- and N2- specific Fc profiles across all vaccine recipients (Fig. 1C), with no two individuals possessing an identical HA- or NA-specific Fc profile.While no single feature was associated with the risk of infection following multiple hypothesis correction, correlational analysis of all H3-specific Fc-effector functions highlighted distinctions between cases and controls (Fig. 1D). Specifically, enhanced coordination was observed in HA-specific antibody functions in the controls. Conversely, increased negatively correlated relationships were observed in the humoral profiles generated in plasma from cases. Cases were marked by the preservation of positive correlations across opsonophagocytic (ADCP, ADNP), complement-fixing (ADCD), and DC activating (ADDCP, HLA-DR, CD83, CD86) antibody functions, but these functions were largely inversely correlated with antibody-mediated NK cell functional antibody responses. These data point to the potential importance of the inclusion of NK cell functions in the protective polyfunctional antibody response to influenza, highlighting a possible role for antibody-mediated NK cell recruitment in protective immunity.Antibody-mediated NK cell activating antibody profiles separate cases from controlsThe observed differences in antibody Fc effector function profiles across cases and controls, as highlighted by the distinct correlation patterns, suggested multivariate, rather than univariate, differences linked to protection from infection. A Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO)-Elastic Net algorithm30,31 was designed to select a minimal set of antibody features that accounted for the greatest variation in antibody profiles across the cases and controls. Features included in this analysis were Fc-mediated innate immune functions by HA- and NA-specific antibodies, FcR binding levels against all tested antibody specificities, antibody isotype levels against all tested antibody specificities, HAI, and NAI. This allowed identification of antibody profiles at peak vaccine-induced immunogenicity prior to exposure that were selectively and uniquely enriched in individuals that either ultimately became infected as compared to those who remained uninfected over the follow-up period. A partial least square discriminant analysis was then used to visualize whether the minimal features could discriminate the groups. Separation was observed in Fc profiles across cases and controls (Fig. 2A, p < 0.01 when compared to both permuted label and random size-matched feature sets, Figure S2A), with the groups separating largely across the x axis, or latent variable 1 (LV1). The LV1 score, which is a composite variable composed of multiple humoral features collapsed into one numeric representation, significantly differed across the cases and controls (Fig. 2B). This indicates that the LV1 variable is a predictive correlate of protection.Fig. 2: Antibody-dependent NK cell activation is a predictor of protection from influenza infection.A Partial least squares discriminant analysis separating cases (individuals who became infected; n = 14, blue) from controls (individuals who remained uninfected; n = 86, yellow) using a robust minimal set of antibody features that contribute to the disease outcome (LASSO-Elastic Net). Latent variables (LVs) describe combinations of humoral features, and scores across LVs indicate the percentage of separation described by that axis. Model is significant (p < 0.01) compared to the accuracy of permuted label and random size-matched models (Mann–Whitney U test). B shows scores for individuals across LV1 with bars at median values for each group (cases n = 14; controls n = 86). Each dot represents an individual.

ADDCP antibody-dependent Dendritic Cell phagocytosis, ADNKA antibody-dependent NK cell activation. See also Figure S2. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageTo understand the features that differed across the groups and begin to untangle their biological importance, the specific humoral measurements used to compose LV1 were ranked in order of their importance in discriminating groups. Four component features of LV1 were enriched in the controls and five features were enriched in the cases (Fig. 2C). IgG3, IgA1, and IgM antibodies directed to both HA and NA antigens were linked to non-protective immunity, suggesting that individuals who ultimately developed influenza symptoms mounted an immune response marked by the generation of de novo (IgM/IgG3) and mucosal (IgA1) humoral responses, which targeted several viral strains including H1N1, H3N2, and B viruses. The IgA1 and IgM signatures were linked to specific HA subtypes (Influenza B and H1N1, respectively), targeting strains that were not in circulation throughout the study32. Because the cases in this study were primarily infected with H3N2, these data suggest that de novo response to non-H3 vaccine strains may result in susceptibility to infection, potentially arising from skewed immunodominance. To determine whether expanded H1N1 responses were related to previous imprinting, given the age of our participants, H1- and N1-specific antibody profiles across cases and controls were directly compared (Figure S2B). While none of the differences between cases and controls reached statistical significance, a trend towards higher H1-specific immunity was observed in cases across all tested strains, pointing towards a potentially skewed humoral immune response among cases compared to controls independently of immune imprinting.The four features enriched in the controls all pointed to a single, specific functional signature. Rather than overall quantitative increases in antibody levels, protected individuals experienced a selective increase in NK cell-activating antibodies directed to both HA and NA, including higher levels of FCGR3A binding and NK cell-activating antibodies. Moreover, deeper analysis of the correlates of the LASSO-selected features highlighted the presence of a large NK cell cluster associated with FCGR3A-binding antibody titers that were enriched in controls, indicating that a broad FCGR3A-binding response was selectively expanded in controls (Figure S2C). Additionally, a broad polyclonal IgG1 response, reactive across HA strains, including binding to both the vaccine subtypes, the infecting subtype, and to heterologous viruses was observed among all study participants (Figure S2D).Emerging data point to a critical role for both conserved HA-stalk and neuraminidase (NA)-specific immunity in protection against influenza33,34,35. Thus, we also examined any univariate differences in stalk or NA-specific responses across the cases and controls. No differences were observed in stalk-specific antibody profiles across the groups, with only a slight enrichment of FCGR2A-binding antibodies in cases (Figure S3A–H). In contrast, a trend towards higher levels of antibodies against N2 A/Hong Kong/4801/2014, N2 A/Texas/50/2012, and H3N2 NAI were observed among the controls, although no differences in N1 A/Belgium/145-MA/2009 were observed across the cases and controls (Figure S3I–L). Taken together, these results suggest that H3- and NA-specific antibodies with the capacity to engage FCGR3A and activate NK cells are associated with lower susceptibility to influenza following vaccination in older adults and mice.Correlation analysis across the antibody subclasses and functions suggested that NK cell activation and FCGR binding were primarily driven by the level of influenza-specific IgG1 levels (Figure S4A). Fc-glycosylation plays a critical role in modulating antibody affinity for Fc-receptors and driving effector function36. Specifically, changes in Fc-fucosylation have been linked to enhanced ADCC37,38. Thus, we next probed the correlation between H3-specific IgG glycosylation and NK cell activation (Fig. 3A). A negative correlation was observed between fucosylated antibodies and NK cell degranulation (CD107a expression), a proxy for ADCC (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, bisecting-n-acetyl glucosamine (GlcNac) and sialylation (S) were also associated with enhanced NK cell degranulation but reduced NK cell cytokine secretion, potentially arguing for an association of particular afucosylated N-glycan structures with NK cell activation. However, to quantitatively explore the role of IgG glycosylation as a correlate of immunity, the levels of fucosylation were compared across cases and controls (Fig. 3B). Significantly increased levels of fucosylation were observed on HA-specific antibodies in cases compared to controls accompanied by increased di-sialylation and no change to bisecting GlcNAc levels (Figure S4B, C). Whether specific afucosylated glycan structures may differ more dramatically across cases and controls on particular epitope-specific antibody subpopulations remains unclear, but could contribute to enhanced NK cell activation and potential control of infection. Thus, while high-resolution glycopeptide analysis of HA-specific antibodies in the future is likely to identify precise N-glycan structures associated with NK cell activation, this data suggests that vaccination may be able to drive NK cell function by tuning antibody glycosylation towards afucosylation, enhancing NK cell activation and thereby conferring enhanced protection.Fig. 3: Antibody Fc glycosylation linked to NK cell activation reflects influenza outcome.Heat map A shows Spearman R correlations between measures of H3 WT-specific NK cell activation (ADNKA) and FCGR3A binding and H3 WT-specific antibody Fc glycoforms.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageHigh-dose vaccination enhances HAI but not the ability of antibodies to activate NK cellsThe administration of higher doses of the influenza vaccine has been successfully utilized as a strategy to drive enhanced immunity in the aging population8. Thus, the impact of high-dose vaccination on specifically tuning the protective signature, NK cell responses, identified in this trial was explored. The impact of regular and high-dose vaccination on NK cell activating antibody levels and glycosylation was examined across cases and controls in each of the dose arms. While dosing improved HAI (Fig. 4A), it did not affect HA-specific antibody levels (Fig. 4B) and did not appear to drive an overall significant pattern of antibody Fc profiles (Fig. 4C). Moreover, closer inspection of NK cell functions and Fc-glycosylation revealed a trend, but not a significant improvement with the increased dose across both circulating HA (Fig. 4D–G) and NA antigen-specific antibodies (Figure S5) after multiple test correction. These data suggest that while high-dose vaccination may increase HAI significantly, dosing alone may be insufficient to fully enhance the level of NK cell-recruiting antibodies. Instead, next-generation strategies using distinct platforms and adjuvants may help improve the quality of vaccine-induced antibody functions, aimed at driving highly protective antibodies against influenza. However, the specific level of NK recruiting antibody required to drive protection in the elderly population remains incompletely understood.Fig. 4: High-dose vaccination enhances HAI but not antibody-mediated NK cell activation.A shows H3N2 A/Victoria/361/2011 HAI titers for regular-dose vaccinees and high-dose vaccinees.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageNK cells in older adults are less responsive to antibody-mediated activationEmerging data point to a gradual exhaustion of the NK cells with age39 that may alter the level of NK cell activating antibodies required to mediate protection. Thus, we finally aimed to determine whether a simple biomarker could be defined to guide next generation vaccine development to induce sufficient levels of ADCC activity to drive protection. Thus, the ability of an ADCC-inducing antibody to activate NK cells was tested in PBMCs from a separate cohort of healthy younger (<40) or older (>65) adults not recently vaccinated for influenza (Fig. 5A). As expected40,41, NK cells from older individuals expressed elevated levels of CD57, possibly a marker of senescence (Fig. 5B). However, limited differences were noted in FCGR3A (CD16) expression on NK cells across the ages (Fig. 5C). To determine whether age-related differences existed in ADCC activity, PBMCs were stimulated with an anti-FCGR3A (anti-CD16) activating antibody, a surrogate of activating ADCC. While NK cell activation was not directly linked to age (for CD107a Spearman’s R = −0.2347, ns; for MIP-1b Spearman’s R = −0.0153, ns), we observed a significant inverse correlation between CD57 expression and the degree of FCGR3A-mediated NK cell degranulation (CD107a), as well as an inverse correlation between CD57 and NK cell functional receptor expression including KIR and the C-type lectin, NKG2C levels (Fig. 5D–F, Figure S6). Thus, in line with our emerging appreciation between the disconnect in numerical and biologic age42,43,44, NK cell senescence, marked by CD57 expression, was linked to defects in NK cell activation via FCGR3A. Conversely, no association with NK cell function or phenotype was observed with BMI or clinical frailty. These data argue that the degree of NK cell senescence, as measured by CD57 but not by age or frailty alone, is a marker of NK cell activatability, providing a biomarker to guide ADCC-inducing vaccine development for aging populations. Thus, enhanced CD57 levels may mark the degree of NK cell senescence and reflect the need for influenza vaccines to induce higher levels of NK cell activating antibodies in older adults to fully harness the NK antiviral activity that may be key to controlling and clearing the virus.Fig. 5: CD57 as a biomarker for aging NK cells less responsive to FCGR3A-mediated stimulation.Density plots A show representative gating for NK cells in Fig. 5.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageDiscussionIn a meta-analysis of 15 publications45, vaccine efficacy increased by approximately 15% with high-dose vaccination, significantly reducing hospitalization in the > 65-year-old age group. While elevated dosing improved HAI and protection8, this study found that dosing did not alter the level of antibodies able to drive NK cell degranulation following vaccination in this population, who already had exposure to influenza through vaccination and natural infection. Similarly, previous efforts to boost immunity with the use of an adjuvant also resulted in enhanced antibody titers and opsonophagocytic functions but led to poor induction of NK cell-activating antibodies46. However, more recent data suggest that distinct adjuvants have the capability of differentially harnessing antibody-effector functions, with the TLR7-agonist AS37, driving the highest levels of NK cell activating antibodies in a COVID-19 vaccine study47. Interestingly, because isotypes changed only marginally across distinct vaccine adjuvants47, these data argue for adjuvant-mediated Fc-glycosylation changes as a key mechanism that may lead to distinct antibody-effector functions48,49. Specifically, here, lower levels of Fc-fucosylation were linked to both enhanced FCGR3A binding and NK cell activation, all of which were enriched in controls compared to cases. Given that dosing did not significantly alter Fc-fucosylation, additional strategies, including the selection of particular adjuvants or novel vaccine platforms may be key to enhancing protection in the aging population. However, whether durable changes in Fc-glycosylation can be induced via vaccination across the ages is unknown but could represent a unique opportunity to shape immunity to influenza and beyond50,51. Further studies will be required to understand these changes, neutralization beyond receptor blocking (HAI), the precise glycan structures required to induce NK cell activation, their durability, whether pre-existing antibody profiles influence the degree or quality of Fc-glycosylation, and how these may be induced preferentially via vaccination, which could not be fully explored in this study lacking baseline and longitudinal samples.A unique observation in this study relates to the emergence of protective ADCC signals against both the influenza HA and NA proteins. While both HA and NA proteins are included in the seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine, only the concentration of HA is controlled at the time of vaccine production. Due at least in part to variability in NA content52,53, typical seasonal influenza vaccination has been linked to lower NA responses, or no NA responses, in healthy adults54. High-dose vaccination, which often but not consistently includes increased NA protein53,54,55, has been shown to induce an anti-NA response in a higher proportion of older adult vaccinees55, as has been observed in mice53. While a significant N2-specific titer enhancement was not observed in this study, significant differences were observed in the N2-specific humoral immune response across cases and controls both in neutralizing and non-neutralizing functions, arguing for a critical role for NA, not just HA, -specific functional immunity in older adults, in concordance with the recent literature56,57,58. Due to the limitations of the study population and small size, we were unable to distinguish whether the binding to precise NAs and HAs may represent antigen binding (Fab) correlates of protection. Instead, here we observed that a combination of broad HA and NA-specific antibody functions and FcR binding profiles, that included circulating forms of the virus, were selectively enriched in individuals that resisted infection. These data suggest that future vaccines able to drive both functional immunity to HA and NA may synergistically improve immunity in older adults. However, future larger correlates studies, linking Fab-specificities with Fc-functionality may ultimately provide mechanistic insights into the precise epitope-specific functional correlates of immunity against influenza.The observed diminished ADCC activity of “aging” NK cells builds on previous literature in older adults, demonstrating NK cell anergy, particularly in the setting of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection40,41. Interestingly, while this defect was not linked to age or frailty, the loss of NK cell degranulation and activation was closely associated with CD57 surface expression, a well-established marker of biological aging. CD57 is a marker of exhausted lymphocytes, particularly NK cells and T cells. While not a signaling molecule, CD57 is a terminally sulfated glycan carbohydrate that is highly expressed on lymphocytes with chronic immune activation59, and expression increases with age60. Future studies will be required to determine if CD57 expression is linked to increased risk or severity of infection, and how the development of FCGR3A-signaling defects is related to this biomarker. Furthermore, additional future studies across populations may provide enhanced resolution on strategies to selectively tune Fc-glycosylation to account for progressive NK cell age and comorbidity-associated senescence.While neutralization and HAI are likely to play a critical role in yearly protection from infection, neutralization and HAI alone represent incomplete metrics of immunity, particularly in older adults6,61. Unlike human challenge studies, individuals in this study were likely exposed to influenza at variable times following peak immunogenicity62, resulting in highly variable immune profiles, particularly among the controls. Yet, despite this heterogeneity in exposure, controls exhibited a more consistent multivariate antibody profile compared to cases, marked by the selective enrichment of FCGR3A and NK cell activating signals in controls. Importantly, NK cells contribute to influenza antiviral control via a diverse set of mechanisms, that extend far beyond simple degranulation of perforin and granzyme63. NK cells can mediate a wide array of critical antiviral functions including the induction of antiviral states via cytokine release, the recruitment of additional effector cells via the secretion of chemokines, and the induction of target cell lysis via the TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) or Fas ligand (FasL)64. Thus, the selective enrichment of HA and NA-specific cytokine activating antibodies in the controls in this study, and not degranulation-biased immune responses, may point to non-granule mediated killing as a key mechanism of protection against influenza. Importantly, depending on the co-ligation of Fc-receptors and additional NK cell receptors, as well as the strength of Fc-receptor binding/signaling by combinations of IgG subclasses/isotypes/Fc-glycans, distinct NK cell functions may be elicited and controlled by future therapeutic and vaccine strategies. Fc-receptor polymorphisms present in the human population also influence the ability of antibodies to drive NK cell activation65. Thus, future in vivo dissection of antibody-mediated cellular functions, particularly within the lung, may reveal the precise mechanism(s) by which NK cells contribute to the control and eradication of Influenza.Given that vaccination remains the most effective approach to prevent influenza infections in older adults66,67,68, strategies are urgently needed to improve both HAI and additional functional correlates of immunity in this population66,67. Novel strategies including adjuvants and new immunogens able to induce ADCC – at the required level marked by CD57 expression - may complement emerging efforts that show elevated HAI activity and breadth69. Future studies will determine whether these novel vaccine technologies, including the newest innovations currently used for SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, will yield superior responses against influenza in high-risk populations by eliciting broadly functional and NK cell-activating polyclonal humoral immune responses.MethodsSamples100 samples drawn 28 days post vaccination from elderly individuals were selected from a previously published clinical trial (NCT: 01427309)8. All participants in the trial provided informed consent. Exclusion criteria, as well as comorbidity information, for this trial can be found in the previous publication8. This trial compared the standard 15 μg per HA dose or high-dose 60 μg per HA Fluzone (Sanofi Pasteur) seasonal influenza vaccines8, so individuals were included who received both doses (n = 50 per vaccine type). These individuals were followed for the duration of the flu season and influenza infection status was confirmed by both PCR and culture. This was not a controlled exposure study, so the influenza exposure status of uninfected individuals is unknown. 14 individuals selected for this study were infected with influenza (any subtype), of which 3 received the high-dose vaccine. Controls were matched for age, gender, and co-morbidities. This study was not pre-specified in the clinical trial protocol. This manuscript represents a post-hoc analysis. For more detail regarding the study population, see Table S1.For comparisons of NK cells from younger and older adults, cryopreserved PMBCs were provided by the University of Connecticut Health Center’s Center on Aging. The original study was approved by the UCHC Institutional Review Board. All participants in the study provided informed consent. For more detail regarding the study population, see Table S2.All studies utilizing human samples reported in this manuscript were additionally approved by the Massachusetts General Hospital Institutional Review Board.Systems serologyFor a summary of antigens assayed in each systems serology assay, see Table S3.Antibody isotyping, subclassing, and FCGR bindingAntigen-specific antibody isotype, subclass, and FCGR binding titers in participant serum were measured using a custom Luminex-based array as previously published70,71,72. Antigens of interest from past, concurrent, and later influenza seasons were coupled to Luminex beads (Luminex Corp.) through carboxyl chemistry. Antigens assayed were: wild type H3 A/Victoria/361/2011, egg adapted H3 A/Victoria/361/2011, H1 stem from H1 A/New Caledonia/20/1999, H1 A/California/07/2009, N1 A/California/07/2009, H1 A/Brisbane/59/2007, H1 A/Chile/1983, H1 A/New Caledonia/20/1999, H3 A/Texas/50/2102, N2 A/Texas/50/2012, H3 A/Brisbane/10/2007, H3 A/Hong Kong/4108/2014, N2 A/Hong Kong/4108/2014, H3 A/Panama/2007/1999, H3 A/Singapore/19/2016, H3 A/Switzerland/9715293/13, HA B/Brisbane/60/2008, HA B/Phuket/3073/2013, HA B/Colorado/06/2017, and ZEBOV GPdTM. All antigens were provided by Sanofi Pasteur except the A/Victoria/361/2011 HAs and H1 stem73 (a group 2 stem was not available at the time of the analysis), which were provided by the Ragon Protein Production Core Facility, and the ZEBOV GPdTM, purchased from Mayflower Biosciences. Antigens were produced in mammalian cells and provided only with negligible endotoxin contamination for in vitro experiments. Antigen-coated beads were incubated with diluted serum overnight at 4 C, shaking. For IgG1 and FCGR detection, samples were diluted to a final concentration of 1:500. For IgG3, IgA1, and IgM detection, samples were diluted to a final concentration of 1:100. Following immune complex formation, beads were washed and incubated with a PE-labeled detection reagent. For antibody isotypes IgG1, IgG3, IgA1, and IgM, PE-labeled detection antibodies were purchased from Southern Biotech (Catalog Nos./Clone Nos. 9052-09/4E3, 9210-09/HP6050, 9130-09/B3506B4, and 9020-09/SA-DA4 respectively) and used at a dilution of 1:160. For FCGRs, FCGR2A (R), FCGR2B, and FCGR3A (V), proteins were acquired from the Duke University Protein Production Facility and incubated at a 4:1 molar ratio with streptavidin-PE (Prozyme) prior to addition to immune complexes at a final concentration of 1 μg/ml. FCGR allotypes that were most common in our population (95% white) were used. After 1 hour incubation at room temperature, excess detector was washed away and labeled immune complexes resuspended in QSol buffer (Intellicyt). Plates were read using an iQue Screener PLUS with Forecyt v7 software (Intellicyt), and antibody levels quantified by PE median fluorescence intensity. All samples were assayed in duplicate and quality control was performed to ensure correlation between sample runs and adequate signal-to-noise ratios.Antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP)Antigens (wild type H3 A/Victoria/361/2011, egg adapted H3 A/Victoria/361/2011, and N2 A/Texas/50/2012) were biotinylated using ezLink NHS-LC-LC-biotin (ThermoFisher) for 30 minutes at room temperature, cleaned up with Zeba spin columns (ThermoFisher), and coupled to Neutravidin fluorescent beads (ThermoFisher) for two hours at 37 °C. Beads were washed repeatedly to eliminate unbound antigen and contaminants. Antigen-coated beads were incubated with diluted serum samples (1:200 dilution for HA antigens and 1:100 dilution for NA antigen) for 2 hours at 37 °C, washed, and incubated overnight with 25,000/well THP-1 monocytes (ATCC Catalog No. TIB-202) to allow for phagocytosis. Cells were washed to remove unphagocytosed immune complexes, then fixed. Plates were read using an iQue Screener PLUS with Forecyt v7 software (Intellicyt). Results are reported as phagocytic scores, which were calculated by multiplying the percentage of monocytes that had undergone phagocytosis by the geometric mean fluorescence intensity of bead-positive monocytes (a proxy for the number of beads phagocytosed by each cell), then dividing by 10,000. All samples were assayed in two independent replicates and quality control was performed to ensure correlation between sample runs and adequate signal-to-noise ratios.Antibody-dependent neutrophil phagocytosis (ADNP)ADNP was assayed as described in ref. 74. Fluorescent beads were coupled to antigens as for ADCP, and incubated with diluted serum samples (1:50 dilution for HA antigens and 1:25 dilution for NA antigen) for 2 hours at 37 °C, washed, and incubated with healthy donor white blood cells isolated by ACK lysis for 1 hour at 37 C. Cells were washed to remove unphagocytosed immune complexes, then stained with CD66b (clone G10F5; BD Catalog No. 561649 or Biolegend Catalog No. 305111) at a dilution of 1:100 to positively identify neutrophils. Cells were fixed and plates were read using an iQue Screener PLUS with Forecyt v7 software (Intellicyt). Results are reported as phagocytic scores, which were calculated by multiplying the percentage of neutrophils that had undergone phagocytosis by the geometric mean fluorescence intensity of bead-positive neutrophils, then dividing by 10,000. All samples were assayed using two independent white blood cell donors and quality control was performed to ensure correlation between sample runs and adequate signal-to-noise ratios.Antibody-dependent dendritic cell phagocytosis (ADDCP)Dendritic cells were derived from blood monocytes isolated from buffy coats (Massachusetts General Hospital Blood Donor Center) by CD14 positive selection (Miltenyi). Following isolation, cells were differentiated in MoDC media (Miltenyi) for 6–7 days. Antigens (wild type H3 A/Victoria/361/2011, egg adapted H3 A/Victoria/361/2011, and N2 A/Texas/50/2012) were coated onto fluorescent beads (ThermoFisher) via carboxy chemistry. Antigen-coated beads were incubated with diluted serum (1:50 dilution for HA antigens and 1:25 dilution for NA antigen) for 2 hours at 37 °C to form immune complexes. Beads were washed and incubated with differentiated DCs for 4 hours at 37 C. DCs were then fixed and stained for cell surface activation makers (HLA-DR (Biolegend Catalog No. 307604/Clone No. L243), CD86 (BD Catalog No. 561128/Clone No. 2331), and CD83 (Biolegend Catalog No. 305330/Clone No. HB15e) all at 0.5 μl/well). Plates were read using an iQue Screener PLUS with Forecyt v7 software (Intellicyt). Results are reported as phagocytic scores, which were calculated by multiplying the percentage of DCs that had undergone phagocytosis by the geometric mean fluorescence intensity of bead-positive neutrophils, then dividing by 10,000, and as percentage of cells that are positive for activation markers. All samples were assayed using two independent DC donors and quality control was performed to ensure correlation between sample runs and adequate signal-to-noise ratios.Antibody-dependent complement deposition (ADCD)ADCD was assayed as described in ref. 75. Fluorescent beads were coupled to antigens as for ADCP, and incubated with diluted serum samples (1:25 dilution for HA antigens and 1:12.5 dilution for NA antigen) for 2 hours at 37 °C, washed, and incubated with purified guinea pig complement (Cedarlane) for 20 minutes at 37 °C. Beads were washed with EDTA-containing buffer, then incubated with anti-C3 fluorescent detection antibody (MP Biomedical Catalog No. 0855385) at 1:100 dilution for 15 minutes at room temperature. Beads were washed and read using an iQue Screener PLUS with Forecyt software (Intellicyt). Results are reported as geometric mean fluorescence intensity of anti-C3 on beads. All samples were assayed in two independent replicates and quality control was performed to ensure correlation between sample runs and adequate signal-to-noise ratios.Antibody-dependent NK cell activation (ADNKA)NK cells were isolated from healthy donor buffy coats (Massachusetts General Hospital Blood Donor Center) using the RosetteSep NK cell enrichment kit (StemCell). Antigens (wild type H3 A/Victoria/361/2011, egg adapted H3 A/Victoria/361/2011, and N2 A/Texas/50/2012) were adsorbed onto 96-well ELISA plates (ThermoFisher), and plates were blocked in 5% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) in PBS (Corning). Coated plates were then incubated with diluted serum samples (1:25 dilution for HA antigens and 1:12.5 dilution for NA antigen) for 2 hours at 37 C, washed, and incubated with purified donor NK cells for 5 hours at 37 C. The NK cells were then removed from antigen-coated plates, fixed, permeabilized, and stained for both cell surface and intracellular markers (CD3 (0.25 μl/well), CD16 (1 μl/well), CD56(1 μl/well), CD107a (2.5 μl/well), MIP-1β (1 μl/well), IFN-γ (3 μl/well); BD Biosciences Catalog Nos./Clone Nos. 558117/UCHT1, 557758/3G8, 557747/B159, 555802/H4A3, 550078/D21-1351, 340449/25723.11, respectively). Cells were analyzed with an iQue Screener PLUS with Forecyt software (Intellicyt). Results are reported as the percent of NK cells (CD3−, CD56/CD16+) positive for each activation marker (CD107a, IFN-ɣ, and MIP-1β). All samples were assayed using two independent NK cell donors and quality control was performed to ensure correlation between sample runs and adequate signal-to-noise ratios.Because PBMCs were not available from the vaccine participants, nor were PBMCs collected for younger individuals, PBMCs from a separate previously established cohort focused on defining immunologic age-related differences in influenza-immunity42,76 were used to compare NK cells from younger and older adults. CD16 antibody (Biolegend Catalog No. 302004) was adsorbed onto 96-well ELISA plates (ThermoFisher), and plates were blocked in 5% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) in PBS (Corning). PBMCs were rapidly thawed, counted, and added to the coated plates, and incubated for 5 hours. The cells were then removed from coated plates, fixed, permeabilized, and stained for live/dead, cell surface, and intracellular markers (CD107a (BD Catalog No. 555802/Clone H4A3 /2.5 μl/well), CD3 (BD Catalog No. 563546/ Clone UCHT1/0.25 μl/well), CD56 (BD Catalog No. 562289/Clone B159/1 μl/well), CD57 (BD Catalog No. 563896/Clone NK-1/1 μl/well), CD14 (BD Catalog No. 563079/Clone MφP9/1 μl/well), CD69 (BD Catalog No. 563835/Clone FN50/1 μl/well), MIP-1b (BD Catalog No. 550078/Clone D21-1351/1 μl/well), CD16 (Biolegend Catalog No. 302006/Clone 3G8/1 μl/well), KIR (Biolegend Catalog Nos. 339512 and 312610/Clones HP-MA4 and CS27/0.5 μl/well each), NKG2D (Biolegend Catalog No. 320832/Clone 1D11/0.5 μl/well), NKp46 (Biolegend Catalog No. 331932/Clone 9E2/0.5 μl/well), Perforin (Biolegend Catalog No. 308130/Clone dG9/1 μl/well), NKG2A (R&D Systems Catalog No. FAB1059S/Clone 131411/0.5 μl/well), and NKG2C(R&D Systems Catalog No. FAB138A/Clone 134591/4 μl/well)). Cells were analyzed on a BD Fortessa 5-laser cytometer with Diva software. Flow cytometry files were analyzed with Flowjo.Antibody glycan analysisSerum samples were heat inactivated at 56o C for one hour, then spun down at >20,000 g to remove debris. Samples were pre-cleared by incubation with streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (NEB) for 1 hour, rotating. Antigens (wild type H3 A/Victoria/361/2011 and N2 A/Texas/50/2012) were biotinylated for ADCP and coupled to streptavidin-coated magnetic beads. Antigen-coated beads and pre-cleared samples were incubated for one hour at 37 C, rotating. Samples were then washed three times and resuspended in IDEZ (NEB) to cleave at the Fc-Fab hinge. Fc glycans were isolated and labeled using the GlycanAssure kit (ThermoFisher) and APTS-labeled glycans were analyzed by capillary electrophoresis on a 3500xL genetic analyzer with GlycanAssure software (ThermoFisher Applied Biosystems, v2). Pre-labeled libraries are used as references. Results are reported for each identified peak as percentage of total isolated glycans, and samples without identifiable traces are excluded from the analysis. Peaks are combined into glycoform groups for visualization and statistical testing (e.g. combining all sialylated glycoforms).Statistical and machine learning analysisUnivariate analyses and visualizations were completed in Prism (Graphpad, v9). Statistical tests are detailed in figure legends.All functional data was averaged across primary cell donors, and no phenotypic and functional differences were observed across neutrophil, NK, or DC donors.HA comparison heat map and correlation heatmaps were created in R (v3.5.1) using the corrplot package (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/corrplot/). Chord diagram was also created in RStudio using the circlize package (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/circlize/index.html). Function heatmaps were created in JMP Pro 14 (SAS) using the hierarchical clustering function.Multivariate and machine learning analyses and visualizations were completed in Matlab R2020a (Mathworks). For Elastic Net-Partial Least Squares analysis of influenza-infected compared to uninfected individuals, a dataset containing antigen-specific antibody isotypes, FCGR binding, neutralization, and antibody-dependent functional data for all 100 study subjects was used. Data were curated prior to multivariate analysis by removing all below or at-background datapoints, as determined by both PBS controls and EBOV-specific (negative control antigen) background levels. Missing datapoints were imputed using K-nearest neighbor and data were normalized using z-scoring to remove spurious comparisons based on different readouts. Elastic Net machine learning was performed in a fivefold cross-validation framework. The Elastic Net lambda coefficient was chosen within this cross-validation framework. A minimum of five antibody features were selected in each replicate. Random size-matched and label-permuted datasets were compared for each model within the cross-validation framework. This analysis was based on a previously published method30. Code for this analysis is provided in Supplementary Software 1.Networks were plotted in Cytoscape v3.8.1 using pairwise correlation data calculated in Matlab.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.

Flucelvax Trivalent is the only cell-based influenza (flu) vaccine in use in the United States. Cell-based flu vaccine 'Cell-based' refers to how the influenza (flu) vaccine is made. Most inactivated flu vaccines are produced by growing flu viruses in eggs. The flu viruses used in the cell-based vaccines are grown in cultured cells of mammalian origin instead of in hen's eggs. Flucelvax is the only influenza vaccine in use in the United States for which the vaccine viruses are grown in a mammalian cell culture. Currently, the recombinant flu vaccine and the cell culture-based flu vaccine are the only egg-free flu vaccines licensed for use in the United States. How cell-based flu vaccines are made‎ Cell-based flu vaccine production does not require chicken eggs because the vaccine viruses used to make vaccine are grown in animal cells. How Influenza (Flu) Vaccines Are Made People who can get Flucelvax Flucelvax is licensed for use in people 6 months and older. People who should not get Flucelvax People who are not within the FDA-approved age range (those younger than 6 months), those who have had severe allergic reactions to any ingredient of the vaccine, or who have had an allergic reaction to a cell-culture based flu vaccine should not get Flucelvax. Advantages of cell-based flu vaccine manufacturing Cell-based flu vaccine production does not use flu viruses grown in eggs and, therefore, is not dependent on the supply of eggs. In addition, use of cell-based candidate vaccine viruses (CVVs) in vaccine production has the potential to offer better protection compared to traditional, egg-based flu vaccines. The viruses used to make cell-based vaccines might be more similar to circulating "wild" flu viruses than the viruses grown in eggs and used to make egg-based vaccines. In one study published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases among Medicare beneficiaries 65 years and older during the 2017–2018 influenza season, cell-based vaccine provided greater protection against flu-related hospitalizations than standard-dose, egg-based vaccine. However, this difference was not seen in similar studies conducted during the 2018–2019 and 2019–2020 flu seasons. Since the 2019–2020 flu season, all flu CVVs used in the Flucelvax are cell-based, making the vaccine egg-free. Cell-based vaccine manufacturing The cell-based vaccine manufacturing process uses mammalian cells (Madin-Darby Canine Kidney, or MDCK cells) to grow flu viruses instead of fertilized hen's eggs. Since the 2019–2020 flu season, all of the CVVs provided to the cell-based vaccine manufacturer are cell-derived rather than egg-derived. Keep Reading: How Influenza (Flu) Vaccines Are Made Significance of FDA approving cell-based candidate vaccine viruses Growing flu viruses in eggs can introduce changes (called egg-adapted changes) that can cause differences between the viruses in the vaccine and the ones that are circulating (‘wild’). These changes may have important implications for the body’s immune response to vaccination. For example, egg-adapted changes could result in production of less effective antibodies by the human immune system, and this can make vaccines less effective at preventing disease caused by the specific flu viruses in circulation. FDA’s approval of cell-based CVVs for use in cell-based flu vaccines could possibly improve the effectiveness of cell-based flu vaccines. Benefits of using cell-based flu vaccines Some observational studies have shown greater protection against flu or flu-like illness among people who received cell-based inactivated influenza vaccines compared with those who received standard-dose egg-based inactivated vaccines. A potential additional advantage of cell-based technology is that it might permit faster start-up of the vaccine manufacturing process in the event of a pandemic. The cells used to manufacture Flucelvax are kept frozen and "banked." Cell banking ensures an adequate supply of cells is readily available for vaccine production. Growing CVVs in cell culture for the manufacture of Flucelvax is not dependent on an egg supply. Cell-based vaccines might be easier to scale up if egg supply is limited. What were the results of the clinical trials using cell-based technology? A clinical trial of the trivalent formulation of Flucelvax demonstrated effectiveness and safety among persons 18 through 49 years old Findings from studies of the trivalent and quadrivalent formulations of Flucelvax in adults aged 50 years and older and in children aged 6 months through 17 years also support the effectiveness and the safety of Flucelvax when used in these populations. Has cell-based technology been used before? Cell culture technology has been used to produce other U.S.-licensed vaccines, including vaccines for rotavirus, polio, smallpox, hepatitis, rubella, and chickenpox. Cell-based flu vaccines have been approved for use in many European countries.

The patients were divided into observation (44 patients) and control (20 patients) groups, based on the presence or absence of concomitant bacterial infection, and clinical data were compared between the groups.ResultsThe mean age in the observation group was 2.71 ± 1.44 years, 42 (95.45%) were aged ≤ 5 years, and 18 (40.9%) had underlying diseases. The mean age in the control group was 4.05 ± 2.21 years, 13 (65%) were aged ≤ 5 years, and 3 (15%) had underlying diseases. There was a statistically significant difference in patient age and the proportion of patients with underlying diseases (P < 0.05). The observation group had higher duration of fever values, a higher number of patients with duration of fever ≥ 7 days, a higher incidence of gasping, and a higher incidence of seizures/consciousness disturbance, and the differences were statistically significant (P < 0.05). Secondary bacterial infections in the observation group were mainly due to gram-negative bacteria, with Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis being the most common pathogens. The observation group had a higher proportion of patients treated in the paediatric intensive care unit and a longer hospital stay, and the differences were statistically significant (P < 0.05).ConclusionSevere influenza virus-associated pneumonia complicated with bacterial infection was more common in children aged ≤ 5 years. Younger patients with underlying diseases were more susceptible to bacterial infection (mainly due to gram-negative bacteria). The timely administration of neuraminidase inhibitors and antibiotics against susceptible bacteria is likely to help improve cure rates. Peer Review reports Influenza, also known as the ‘flu, causes periodic pandemics. It has been estimated that seasonal influenza affects approximately 1 billion people worldwide every year. Among paediatric populations, the influenza infection rate has been reported to be as high as 20–30% [1, 2], which is considerably higher than that in adults. Pneumonia is a common cause of hospitalisation in patients infected with the influenza virus, and infected children have a high tendency to develop severe influenza virus-associated pneumonia, which may be life-threatening [3, 4]. Previous studies have found that patients infected with the influenza virus are prone to developing secondary bacterial infection, which usually occurs within 7 days of influenza virus infection and may aggravate disease severity and affect the prognoses of such patients [5]. This issue is particularly prominent in the paediatric influenza pneumonia population. Given the current lack of studies on severe influenza virus-associated pneumonia complicated with bacterial infection in children in China, we aimed to analyse the clinical characteristics of paediatric patients with concomitant severe influenza virus-associated pneumonia and bacterial infection who had been treated at Xiamen Children’s Hospital, to enhance understanding of this disease and help determine appropriate disease prevention strategies and treatment for clinicians.Patients and methodsPatientsIn this retrospective study, we analysed data concerning hospitalised patients with severe influenza virus-associated pneumonia at Xiamen Children’s Hospital between January 1, 2018 and December 31, 2021. We divided the patients into two groups based on the presence or absence of concomitant bacterial infection. Patients with concomitant bacterial infection were included in an observation group, while those without were assigned to a control group. A diagnosis of severe pneumonia was made if any of the following criteria were met: (i) a poor general condition; (ii) consciousness disturbance; (iii) cyanosis; (iv) rapid breathing (age < 2 months: respiratory rate (RR) ≥ 60 breaths/min; age ≥ 2 months to 1 year: RR ≥ 50 breaths/min; age > 1–5 years: RR ≥ 40 breaths/min; age > 5 years: RR ≥ 30 breaths/min); (v) dyspnoea (moaning, nasal flaring, and the “three depression” sign, i.e., depression of the suprasternal fossa, supraclavicular fossa, and intercostal space); (vi) pulse oxygen saturation ≤ 92%; (vii) refusal to eat or signs of dehydration; (viii) plain chest radiography or computed tomography (CT) scan showing lung infiltration, pneumothorax, lung necrosis, and lung abscess in ≥ two-thirds of one lung, and; (ix) extrapulmonary complications.Inclusion criteria concerning the observation group were as follows: (i) meeting the diagnostic criteria for influenza: presence of epidemiological history, influenza-like symptoms, and at least one positive result for influenza antigen or nucleic acid tests; (ii) meeting the diagnostic criteria for severe pneumonia; (iii) patient age: 1 month–12 years; (iv) clinical manifestations of infection that could not be explained by influenza, namely, elevated leukocytes, C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin during anti-infective treatment; positive blood cultures, positive cerebrospinal fluid, pleural effusion, sputum, and alveolar lavage fluid, with the colony requirements for positive sputum culture being as follows: ≥105 CFU/ml in tracheal aspirate, ≥104 CFU/ml in alveolar lavage fluid; and the presence of bacteria and leukocyte infiltration and phagocytosis under sputum smear microscopy.Exclusion criteria were as follows: (i) incomplete data for statistical analysis; (ii) specimens with contamination or bacterial colonisation; sputum specimens with > 10 squamous epithelial cells/high power field (HPF), and; (iii) < 25 leukocytes/HPF, which were considered unfit for use. If pathogens were isolated from non-sterile sites without imaging or clinical signs of infection, bacterial colonisation was considered present. Other cases of severe influenza virus-associated pneumonia that had not been included in the observation group were included in the control group. The present study was approved by the ethics committee of our hospital (Approval number: XCSER [2022] 38).MethodsData collectionData concerning patients with severe influenza virus-associated pneumonia who had been treated at our hospital between January 1, 2018 and December 31, 2021 were retrieved from the electronic inpatient records system of our hospital. Baseline information in relation to clinical data, symptoms, signs, auxiliary examination results, treatment details, prognoses, and patient outcomes were collected.Pathological examination methodsInfluenza antigen testing was performed using the colloidal gold assay (Standard Diagnostics Inc., South Korea), bacteria were detected using a fully automated microbial mass spectrometer (Microflex LF/SH, Shanghai), and bacterial susceptibility to antibiotics was tested using a fully automated antimicrobial susceptibility testing system (VITEK 2 Compact, France). All methods were carried out accordance with relevant guidelines.Statistical analysisData were statistically analysed using SPSS version 23.0 software. Normally distributed measurement data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD) and compared between groups using a t-test. Non-normally distributed measurement data were expressed as median (interquartile range) [M (P25–P75)] and compared between groups using a Mann-Whitney U test. Count data were expressed as the number (%) of patients and compared between groups using a χ2 test.ResultsGeneral dataIn total, 64 patients with severe influenza virus-associated pneumonia were included in this study. The observation group comprised 44 paediatric patients (boys, n = 32; girls, n = 12). The mean age was 2.71 ± 1.44 years, with 15 (34.1%) patients aged ≤ 2 years, 27 (61.4%) aged 2–5 years, and 2 (4.5%) aged > 5 years. Within the observation group, 35 (79.6%) patients had influenza type A infection and 9 (20.4%) had influenza type B infection. Concomitant infections included Haemophilus influenzae (H. influenzae) infection (n = 18 patients), Moraxella catarrhalis (M. catarrhalis) infection (n = 12 patients), Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection (n = 3 patients), Staphylococcus aureus infection (n = 4 patients), Streptococcus pneumoniae infection (n = 6 patients), and infection due to ≥ 2 types of bacteria in 1 patient. Eighteen (40.9%) patients had underlying diseases, which included febrile seizures (n = 8), congenital heart disease (n = 4), hydrocephalus (n = 1), developmental disorder (n = 1), epilepsy (n = 2), and asthma (n = 2).The control group comprised 20 paediatric patients (boys, n = 13; girls, n = 7). The mean age was 4.05 ± 2.21 years, with 6 (30%) patients aged ≤ 2 years, 7 (35%) aged 2–5 years, and 7 (35%) aged > 5 years. Within the control group, 15 (75%) patients had influenza type A infection, 5 (25%) had influenza type B infection, and 3 (15%) had underlying diseases, including febrile seizures, congenital heart disease, and developmental disorder (1 patient each, respectively). Table 1 shows a comparison of general data between the observation and control groups.Clinical characteristicsAmong the observation group patients, 43 developed pyrexia with a peak temperature of 39.8 °C (range, 39.5–40.08 °C) and a pyrexia duration of 6 (5.25–7) days, and 21 (47.73%) patients had a pyrexia duration of ≥ 7 days. Other clinical symptoms included cough in all patients, gasping in 31 (70.45%), seizures/consciousness disturbance in 26 (59.09%), and audible pulmonary rales in 36 (81.82%) patients. In 23 (52.27%) patients, pulmonary imaging results suggested the presence of pulmonary consolidation and atelectasis. Moreover, 2 patients had respiratory failure, 3 had septic shock, 2 had toxic encephalopathy, 3 had liver injury, 1 had metabolic acidosis, and 1 patient had tracheal stenosis.In the control group, all 20 patients developed pyrexia with a peak temperature of 39.3 °C (range, 39–40.2 °C) and a pyrexia duration of 5 (3–6) days, and 4 (20%) patients had a pyrexia duration of ≥ 7 days. Other clinical symptoms included cough in all patients, gasping in 8 (40%), seizures/consciousness disturbance in 5 (25%), and audible pulmonary rales in 15 (75%) patients. In 10 (50%) patients, pulmonary imaging results suggested the presence of pulmonary consolidation and atelectasis. There was also 1 patient with respiratory failure, 1 in septic shock, 2 with brainstem encephalitis, 1 with liver injury, 1 with myocardial damage, and 2 with agranulocytosis. Table 2 shows a comparison of clinical characteristics between the observation and control groups.Bacterial culture and susceptibility to antibioticsA total of 46 positive culture specimens were collected from the 44 patients in the observation group, of which 44 were oronasal sputum specimens and 2 were alveolar lavage fluid specimens. In 2 patients, positive cultures were detected in both the oronasal sputum and alveolar lavage fluid specimens. All H. influenzae cultures were susceptible to ceftriaxone, cefotaxime sodium, and meropenem, showing resistance rates of 61.7%, 76.6%, 27.7%, and 6.4% to ampicillin, co-trimoxazole, cefuroxime, and ampicillin/sulbactam, respectively. All M. catarrhalis cultures were susceptible to ampicillin/sulbactam, amoxicillin/sulbactam, and ciprofloxacin, and exhibited resistance rates of 59.4% and 13.3% to ampicillin and co-trimoxazole, respectively.Treatment and outcomesThe observation group patients were treated with neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs), with 36 patients having received oseltamivir via oral administrationasal feeding, 6 patients having received peramivir via intravenous infusion, and 2 patients having received oral oseltamivir followed by peramivir via intravenous infusion. In 31 patients, NAIs were used for the first time at > 48 h after disease onset. Antibiotics were administered to all patients over a duration of 7 (range, 5–8) days. Eighteen (40.9%) patients underwent fibreoptic bronchoalveolar lavage therapy and 26 (59.1%) were treated in the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU). The average length of hospital stay in the observation group was 12 (range, 9–14) days. One patient aged ≤ 5 years who had underlying epilepsy died of haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.The control group patients were also treated with NAIs, with 19 patients receiving oseltamivir via oral administrationasal feeding and 1 patient receiving oral oseltamivir followed by peramivir via intravenous infusion. In 12 patients, NAIs were used for the first time at > 48 h after disease onset. Six (30%) patients underwent fibreoptic bronchoalveolar lavage therapy and 5 (25%) were treated in the PICU. The control group had an average length of hospital stay of 7 (range, 6–12.8) days and no patients died.

Table 1 A comparison of general data between the observation and control groupsFull size table Table 2 A comparison of clinical characteristics between the observation and control groupsFull size table Table 3 Comparison of treatment between the observation and control groupsFull size tableDiscussionPneumonia due to influenza virus infection is a common cause of hospitalisation among children. In severe cases, patients may experience respiratory failure, septic shock, or even life-threatening conditions [3, 4, 6]. One study reported that > 10,000 children around the world aged ≤ 5 years die from influenza virus-associated pneumonia annually, with most being paediatric patients with influenza virus-associated pneumonia complicated with bacterial infection [7]. Therefore, clinicians should pay greater attention to concomitant influenza virus-associated pneumonia and bacterial infection in children, particularly in children with severe illness. In our study, the average age of the observation group was significantly lower than that of the control group, indicating that younger age is associated with a higher risk of secondary bacterial infection in severe influenza virus-associated pneumonia. We also found that children aged ≤ 5 years comprised 95.5% (42/44) of the patients in the observation group, which was similar to the findings reported by Zhou et al. [1]. Besides, the observation group had a higher proportion of patients with underlying diseases than the control group. There was also one death in the observation group, which occurred in a patient with a history of epilepsy.Given these findings, the possibility of concomitant bacterial infection in patients aged ≤ 5 years with severe influenza virus-associated pneumonia should be taken seriously. Relevant guidelines developed by experts in China and other countries have stated that children aged ≤ 5 years are not only susceptible to influenza virus infection but are also a high-risk population for secondary bacterial infection [8, 9]. This susceptibility may be explained partly by the fact that influenza virus replication in the respiratory tract reduces ciliary beat frequency in the airway, and the haemagglutinin and neuraminidase proteins of the virus alter the surface protein receptors of infected cells, thereby providing binding sites for bacterial adhesion [10]. Another key cause is immune cell dysfunction induced by the influenza virus or host factors. Previous research has indicated that immune cells such as alveolar macrophages, neutrophils, and natural killer cells form the second line of defence of the human body against bacterial invasion. However, influenza virus infection can destroy this line of defence, resulting in the weakening of phagocytosis, chemotaxis, and intracellular killing; such a mechanism is especially prominent in infected patients with reduced immune function [11]. In addition, these findings also suggest that children with underlying diseases may be more prone to developing concomitant bacterial infection when they have severe influenza, and the presence of underlying diseases is a risk factor for progression to severe disease or even death in paediatric patients with influenza [12]. Therefore, particular attention should be paid to paediatric patients with influenza and underlying diseases in clinical practice.The reported incidence rates of influenza virus infection complicated with bacterial infection have varied over recent years. In a 2009 multicentre study conducted at 17 hospitals in China, 14.0% of children with influenza virus infection had a concomitant bacterial infection [13]. A 2018 study involving 838 paediatric patients with influenza in 35 PICUs in the United States reported the presence of concomitant bacterial infection in 274 (32.7%) patients, [14] a higher incidence rate than that reported in the 2009 study. Our results showed that the proportion of patients with influenza virus infection and with concomitant bacterial infection was 68.74% (44/64), which was higher than the aforementioned incidence rates. Certain biases may exist in our study due to its single-centre design and small sample size; however, the overall increasing trend in the proportion of paediatric patients with severe influenza virus-associated pneumonia complicated with bacterial infection cannot be ignored, especially in severe paediatric cases. We also observed clear changes in the bacterial spectra of patients with concomitant influenza and bacterial infection. The previously mentioned multicentre study concerning patients with influenza and bacterial coinfection in China found that gram-positive bacteria accounted for > 60% of all cases [13]. The results of a meta-analysis of > 3000 cases of influenza and bacterial coinfection in various countries in 2003–2014 also showed that gram-positive bacteria predominated, with Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus infections being the most common [15]. Our results differed from those of the aforementioned studies in that gram-negative bacterial infections accounted for 75% (33/44) of patients with severe influenza virus-associated pneumonia complicated with bacterial infection, with H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis accounting for 40.9% (18/44) and 27.3% (12/44) of patients, respectively. Possible reasons for the predominance of gram-negative bacteria in the present study are as follows. First, in recent years, changes have occurred in the bacterial spectra of lower respiratory tract infections in children, causing the incidence rate of gram-negative bacterial infections to exceed that of gram-positive bacterial infections. A 2015 Chinese study by Li et al. [16] reported that gram-negative bacteria accounted for approximately 74.1% of lower respiratory tract infections in children, which was significantly higher than the incidence rate for gram-positive bacterial infections. In 2019, Lim et al. [17] reported that, in Korea, H. influenzae accounted for 25.6% of cases of community-acquired pneumonia with viral and bacterial coinfection and that the rate of coinfection exhibited an increasing trend, which is consistent with the H. influenzae infection rate of 40.9% (18/44) observed in our study. Second, differences in bacterial strains causing secondary bacterial infections may exist between patients with severe influenza virus-associated pneumonia and those with common influenza virus infection. Kim et al. [18] reported that secondary bacterial infections in mechanically ventilated patients with influenza type A infection were most commonly due to Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which are all gram-negative bacteria. Third, factors such as differences in regional climate and sample size may also affect the conclusions obtained in different studies. Nonetheless, paying attention to changes in the bacterial spectra of concomitant bacterial infection in paediatric influenza virus-associated pneumonia is of practical significance for early diagnosis confirmation and timely administration of targeted antibacterial treatment.Influenza and bacterial coinfection lack specific manifestations in the early stage and can only be confirmed through a combined analysis of clinical symptoms, aetiology, and other laboratory examination results. Our findings showed that patients in the observation group were more prone to longer pyrexia duration and clinical symptoms such as gasping, seizures, and consciousness disturbance than patients in the control group. This suggests that the development of the aforementioned symptoms in children with severe influenza virus-associated pneumonia may serve as a warning sign of the possibility of concomitant bacterial infection. The observation group also exhibited significant increases in inflammatory indicators such as C-reactive protein and procalcitonin levels, indicating that these elevated levels in paediatric patients with severe influenza virus-associated pneumonia may assist in the early identification of bacterial infection. In addition, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels were also significantly elevated in the observation group compared with the control group. A retrospective study of Japanese patients with pneumonia showed that the LDH level can serve as an indicator of lung tissue damage in children [19]. Our study results also suggest that LDH may also be used as a predictive indicator of the presence or absence of concomitant bacterial infection in children with severe influenza virus-associated pneumonia. However, further deliberation is required for the establishment of specific quantitative criteria.In this study, the bacterial species most commonly detected in the patients were H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis. We found that H. influenzae was susceptible to cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, and meropenem but exhibited a resistance rate of 61.7% to ampicillin, which is close to the resistance rate of 69.19% reported by Mai et al. [20]. This result suggests that ampicillin may no longer be considered the drug of choice for the treatment of H. influenzae infection. Third-generation cephalosporins may instead be selected for initial empiric treatment. M. catarrhalis was susceptible to ampicillin/sulbactam, amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium, and ciprofloxacin, and exhibited resistance rates of 59.4% and 13.3% to ampicillin and co-trimoxazole, respectively. Therefore, we recommend the use of penicillin-based compound formulations as first-choice drugs for initial empiric treatment of M. catarrhalis infection in children. Ricketson et al. [21] reported that patients who did not receive standardised antibiotic treatment had a 5.6-fold increase in case fatality rates compared with a standardised treatment group. Similarly, we found that satisfactory therapeutic effects could be achieved with early administration of antibiotics against susceptible bacteria in the observation group.This study had some limitations. First, this was a single-centre retrospective study that included patients from the past four years. Therefore, the data used for analysis were limited and may not fully reflect the characteristics of severe influenza virus-associated pneumonia complicated with bacterial infection in children. Second, all patients included in this study originated from Xiamen, Fujian Province, in Southern China, which may have created certain biases given the existence of genetic variation and differences in prevalent viral and bacterial strains among different geographical regions. In future research, we aim to address these shortcomings and increase the sample size to enhance the accuracy of our results.In conclusion, severe influenza virus-associated pneumonia complicated with bacterial infection was found to be more common in paediatric patients aged ≤ 5 years. Younger patients with underlying diseases were more susceptible to bacterial infection. Secondary bacterial infections were mainly due to gram-negative bacteria, with H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis being the most commonly detected pathogens in the patients. The clinical manifestations of severe influenza virus-associated pneumonia complicated with bacterial infection lacked specificity. However, the following may serve as warning signs of the possibility of concomitant bacterial infection: severe clinical manifestations such as persistent high-grade pyrexia, consciousness disturbance, and gasping during the early stage; elevated C-reactive protein, procalcitonin and LDH levels; and non-improvement of disease condition or relapse following an initial response when antiviral treatment was administered. Once the presence of bacterial infection has been confirmed, empiric antibiotic therapy should be initiated as soon as possible.

Make sure to protect yourself as much as possible by keeping your vaccinations up to date.COVID-19 vaccinesCOVID-19 is a respiratory disease that causes symptoms such as fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Older adults are more likely than younger people to get very sick from COVID-19. The disease can lead to serious illness and death.Studies show that COVID-19 vaccines reduce the risk of getting this disease. The vaccine will also help keep you from getting seriously ill or having to go to the hospital if you do get COVID-19. We are still learning how effective COVID-19 vaccines are against new variants of the virus. Read more about COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that older adults stay up to date with COVID-19 vaccines. Read more about COVID-19 vaccines from the CDC and find out the current vaccine recommendations for older adults.Contact your local health department or visit Vaccines.gov to find out where you can get vaccinated.Flu vaccine for older adultsFlu — short for influenza — is a virus that can cause fever, chills, sore throat, stuffy nose, headache, and muscle aches. Flu is very serious when it gets in your lungs. Older adults are at a higher risk for developing serious complications from the flu, such as pneumonia.The flu is easy to pass from person to person. The virus also changes over time, which means you can get it again. To ensure flu vaccines remain effective, the vaccine is updated every year.Everyone age 6 months and older should get an annual flu vaccine, but the protection from a flu vaccine can lessen with time, especially in older adults. Still, you are less likely to become seriously ill or hospitalized with the flu if you get the vaccine. A flu vaccine is especially important if you have a chronic health condition such as heart disease or diabetes.Ideally, you should get your vaccine by the end of October each year so you are protected when the flu season starts. It takes at least two weeks for the vaccine to be effective. However, if you have not received your flu vaccine by the end of October, it’s not too late — flu season typically peaks in December or January. As long as the flu virus is spreading, getting vaccinated will help protect you.There are flu vaccines designed specifically for older adults. The CDC recommends that people age 65 and older receive a higher-dose flu vaccine or an adjuvanted flu vaccine (one with an additional ingredient called an adjuvant that helps create a stronger immune response). These vaccines are potentially more effective than the standard flu vaccine for people in this age group. Talk with a health care provider or pharmacist about which vaccine is best for you.Medicare will pay for the flu vaccine, and so will private health insurance plans. You can get a flu vaccine at a doctor's office or local health department, as well as at many grocery stores, drug stores, and pharmacies. Flu shots may also be available at other community locations, such as schools, religious centers, and workplaces. The ingredients of a specific vaccine are the same wherever you receive it.RSV vaccine for older adultsRespiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common virus that usually causes mild, cold-like symptoms. However, older adults have a higher risk of developing severe symptoms if they are infected with RSV. The illness can be particularly dangerous for people who have chronic diseases or a weakened immune system. Older adults who get very sick from an RSV infection may need to be hospitalized, and the illness can even be life-threatening.RSV vaccines are available to protect older adults from the serious health problems that can occur with RSV infection. The CDC recommends that adults 60 years and older talk with their health care provider about whether they should receive the RSV vaccine. Like the flu, RSV infections are most common in the fall and winter months, so consider getting vaccinated before RSV season starts. However, you can benefit from the RSV vaccine at any time of year.You can get the RSV vaccine at a doctor’s office, your local health department, and many pharmacies. Medicare Part D and private health insurance plans may pay some or all of the cost. Check with Medicare or your health plan for details about coverage.Vaccines to help prevent pneumoniaPneumococcal disease is a serious infection that spreads from person to person by air. It often causes pneumonia in the lungs and it can affect other parts of the body. Older adults are at higher risk than younger people of getting very sick or dying from pneumococcal disease.The CDC recommends that all adults age 50 and older get pneumococcal vaccination. This vaccine helps protect you from getting a serious infection, including pneumonia. There are multiple forms of the pneumococcal vaccine: Talk to a health care provider to find out which is best for you. You can also visit the CDC’s Pneumococcal Vaccination webpage to learn more about the types of vaccines that are available.Medicare will pay for the pneumococcal vaccine, as will many private insurance plans. You can get the vaccine at a doctor’s office, your local health department, and many pharmacies. Pneumococcal vaccines may also be available at other community locations, such as schools, religious centers, and workplaces.Tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis (whooping cough) vaccinesTetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis are diseases caused by bacteria that can lead to serious illness and death.Tetanus (sometimes called lockjaw) is caused by bacteria found in soil, dust, and manure. It can enter the body through a deep cut or burn.Diphtheria is a serious illness that can affect the tonsils, throat, nose, or skin. It can spread from person to person.Pertussis, also known as whooping cough, causes uncontrollable, violent coughing fits that make it hard to breathe. It can spread from person to person.Getting vaccinated is the best way to prevent tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis. Most people get vaccinated as children, but you also need booster shots as you get older to stay protected against these diseases. The CDC recommends that adults get a Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis) or Td (tetanus, diphtheria) booster shot every 10 years. Ask a health care provider when you need your booster shot.You can get the Tdap or Td vaccine at a doctor’s office, your local health department, and many pharmacies. Medicare Part D and private health insurance plans may pay some or all of the cost. Check with Medicare or your health plan for details about coverage.Shingles vaccine for older adultsShingles is caused by the same virus as chickenpox. If you had chickenpox, the virus is still in your body. As you get older, the virus could become active again and cause shingles. Read and share this infographic about getting a shingles vaccine. Shingles affects the nerves. Common symptoms include burning, shooting pain, tingling, and/or itching, as well as a rash with fluid-filled blisters. Even when the rash disappears, the pain can remain. This is called post-herpetic neuralgia, or PHN.The shingles vaccine is safe, and it may keep you from getting shingles and PHN. Healthy adults age 50 and older should get vaccinated with the shingles vaccine, Shingrix, which is given in two doses. (Zostavax, an earlier shingles vaccine, is no longer available in the United States.)You should get a shingles vaccine even if you’ve already had chickenpox or the chickenpox vaccine, or if you don't remember whether you had chickenpox. You should also get the shingles vaccine if you've already had shingles or received Zostavax. However, you should not get a vaccine if you currently have shingles, are sick or have a fever, have a weakened immune system, or have had an allergic reaction to Shingrix. Check with a health care provider if you are not sure what to do.You can get the shingles vaccine at a doctor’s office, your local health department, and many pharmacies. Medicare Part D and private health insurance plans may pay some or all of the cost. Check with Medicare or your health plan for details about coverage.Travel vaccinesCheck with a doctor, a pharmacist, or your local health department about vaccines you need if you're planning to travel to other countries. The vaccines that are required and recommended are based on your destination, planned activities, and medical history. Sometimes multiple vaccines or doses are needed. It's best to get them at least four to six weeks before you travel to allow time to build up immunity and get the best protection, particularly from those that may require multiple doses.Contact Medicare or your private health insurance plan to find out whether they cover the travel vaccines you need. You may be able to get some travel vaccines from a local health care provider. Others are available from health departments and travel medicine clinics. For more information, visit the CDC Traveler’s Health website or call its information line at 800-232-4636.Vaccine safety and side effectsVaccines are very safe, and they can help keep you from getting serious or life-threatening diseases. The most common side effects for all these vaccines are mild and may include pain, swelling, or redness where the vaccine was given.Before getting any vaccine, talk with a doctor or pharmacist about your health history, including past illnesses and treatments, as well as any allergies. A health care provider can address any concerns you have.It's a good idea to keep your own vaccination record, listing the types and dates of your shots, along with any side effects or problems.Learn more about vaccine safety and side effects.You may also be interested inLearning more about flu and older adultsFinding out about shinglesReading about Long COVID Sign up for e-alerts about healthy aging *Email Address For more information about shots and vaccines Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 800-232-4636 888-232-6348 (TTY) cdcinfo@cdc.gov www.cdc.gov Medicare 800-633-4227 (1-800-MEDICARE) 877-486-2048 (TTY) www.medicare.gov National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases 866-284-4107 800-877-8339 (TTY) ocpostoffice@niaid.nih.gov www.niaid.nih.gov Vaccines.gov 800-232-0233 888-720-7489 (TTY) www.vaccines.gov This content is provided by the NIH National Institute on Aging (NIA).

Hundreds of millions of Americans have safely received flu vaccines over the past 50 years, and there has been extensive research supporting the safety of flu vaccines Flu vaccines cannot cause flu. Side effects of the flu vaccine are generally mild and go away on their own within a few days. Flu vaccine cannot cause flu The vaccines either contain inactivated virus, meaning the viruses are no longer infectious, or a particle designed to look like an influenza virus to your immune system. While the nasal spray flu vaccine does contain a live virus, the viruses are changed so that they cannot give you the flu. Flu vaccine side effects Like any medical product, vaccines can cause side effects. Side effects of the flu vaccine are generally mild and go away on their own within a few days. Common side effects from the flu shot include: Soreness, redness, and/or swelling from the shot Headache Fever Nausea Muscle aches The flu shot, like other injections, can occasionally cause fainting. Keep Reading: Fainting and VaccinesSome studies have found a possible small association of injectable flu vaccine with Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). Overall, these studies estimated the risk for GBS after vaccination as fewer than 1 or 2 cases of GBS per one million people vaccinated. Other studies have not found any association. GBS also, rarely, occurs after flu illness. Even though GBS following flu illness is rare, GBS is more common following flu illness than following flu vaccination. GBS has not been associated with the nasal spray vaccine. Keep Reading: Guillain-Barré Syndrome and Flu Vaccine Concerning signs or symptoms after getting a flu vaccine With any vaccine, look for any unusual conditions, such as a high fever, behavior changes, or signs of a severe allergic reaction after vaccination. Signs of a severe allergic reaction can include: Difficulty breathing Hoarseness or wheezing Swelling around the eyes or lips Hives Paleness Weakness A fast heart beat or dizziness Life threatening allergic reactions to the flu shot are rare. These signs would most likely happen within a few minutes to a few hours after the vaccine is given. Severe reaction to a flu vaccine If you think it is a severe allergic reaction or other emergency that can't wait, call 9-1-1 and get to the nearest hospital. Otherwise, call your doctor. Afterward, the reaction should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Your doctor might file this report, or you can do it yourself through the VAERS website, or by calling 1-800-822-7967. Next steps if you think you have been injured by the flu vaccine If you believe you have been injured by a flu vaccine you may be eligible to receive compensation from the federal government for your injuries if certain criteria are met. To learn more visit the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program website or call 1-800-338-2382. Some should not receive a flu vaccine CDC recommends everyone 6 months of age and older should receive an annual flu vaccination with rare exceptions. Individuals who can't get the flu shot include: Children younger than 6 months, since they are too young to get a flu shot. Individuals with severe, life-threatening allergies to flu vaccine or any ingredient(s) in the vaccine. Individuals should talk with their doctor before getting the flu shot if they: Have had a severe allergy to eggs or any of the ingredients in the vaccine. Special Considerations Regarding Egg Allergy has more information about egg allergies and flu vaccine. Have had Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). Are not feeling well. There are multiple flu vaccines available, and not all flu vaccines can be given to people of all ages.

Keep Reading: Flu Vaccine Safety and Pregnancy Monitoring the safety of flu vaccines CDC and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) closely monitor the safety of vaccines approved for use in the United States. CDC uses two primary systems to monitor the safety of flu vaccines: Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS): an early warning system that helps CDC and FDA monitor problems following vaccination. Anyone can report possible vaccine side effects to VAERS. Generally, VAERS reports cannot determine if an adverse event was caused by a vaccine, but these reports can help determine if further investigations are needed. Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD): A collaboration between CDC and nine health care organizations which allows ongoing monitoring and proactive searches of vaccine-related data. Recommendations for vaccination of people with egg allergy People with egg allergy may get any vaccine (egg-based or non-egg-based) that is otherwise appropriate for their age and health status. Previously, it was recommended that people with severe allergy to egg (those who have had any symptom other than hives with egg exposure) be vaccinated in an inpatient or outpatient medical setting. Beginning with the 2023-2024 season, additional safety measures are no longer recommended for flu vaccination of people with an egg allergy beyond those recommended for receipt of any vaccine, regardless of the severity of previous reaction to egg. All vaccines should be given in settings where allergic reactions can be recognized and treated quickly.

Researchers gathered the data in July as part of the National Poll on Healthy Aging. Findings revealed that 52% had heard of the RSV vaccine, with 21% saying they're very interested in getting it and 43% responding that they're somewhat interested. People who rated their health good to excellent were more likely to have heard about the vaccine, and the team found that overall interest in the vaccine rose by age, which they said corresponds to the rising risk from the virus.Animal health experts yesterday warned about the risk of H5N1 avian flu spread to Antarctica's wildlife populations, as the virus continues to spread southward. A team from the World Organization for Animal Health and the UN Food and Agriculture Organization said the circulating H5N1 clade first turned up in South America in Colombia in October 2022 and has devastated wildlife in countries such as Peru and Chile. In just 3 months, the virus spread to the southern tip of South America, with the southernmost detection recently reported in a sea lion in Chile. The risk is substantial that the virus will continue southward to reach Antarctica and its offshore islands, especially with the spring migration of birds from South America to Antarctica. Though little can be done to stop the virus from spreading, the group urged scientists to document mortality events, limit amplification by removing carcasses, and follow biosecurity practices to reduce the risk of humans spreading the virus among the animal populations.In European avian flu developments, Finland recently reported another H5N1 outbreak at a fur farm, which involved a facility housing blue foxes, raising the number of outbreaks at such farms to 25. Also, the country began culling 120,000 foxes and mink at 13 affected fur farms, according to Agence France-Presse. Elsewhere, Russian veterinary officials have confirmed H5N1 in a seal found dead in Sakhalin oblast, according to an official statement translated and posted by Avian Flu Diary, an infectious disease news blog. Sakhalin oblast is in far eastern Russia, just north of Japan. CDC launches program to boost sepsis care in US hospitals News brief Chris Dall, MA Topics Antimicrobial Stewardship Public Health The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) today announced the launch of a new program to help US hospitals implement, monitor, and optimize programs for sepsis care.Modeled after the CDC's Core Elements of Antibiotic Stewardship, the Hospital Sepsis Program Core Elements aim to help hospitals organize staff, identify resources, and structure their sepsis programs so they can rapidly identify and provide effective care for all types of patients with sepsis, which is a complex condition that can manifest in a variety of ways and isn't easy to recognize.Programs dedicated to the care of patients with sepsis have been successful in saving more lives, reducing the amount of time patients need to stay in the hospital, and cutting healthcare costs.Sepsis occurs when the body overreacts to a bacterial or viral infection, triggering a chain of events that leads to tissue damage, organ failure, and death. The CDC estimates that at least 1.7 million Americans develop sepsis each year, and at least 350,000 adults who develop sepsis during their hospitalization die or are moved into hospice. Survival and recovery from sepsis requires rapid identification, action, and coordination from multiple hospital departments, CDC Director Mandy Cohen, MD, MPH, said at a news briefing."We know that programs dedicated to the care of patients with sepsis have been successful in saving more lives, reducing the amount of time patients need to stay in the hospital, and cutting healthcare costs," Cohen said. "CDC believes that sepsis programs in every hospital, regardless of size, location, and resources, can strengthen the quality of care delivered to these patients and ensure their survival.Only 55% of hospitals provide for sepsis leadershipFindings from a CDC survey published today in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report found that while 73% of US hospitals have a sepsis committee, only 55% provide dedicated time for sepsis program leaders, which Cohen said is an indication that more works needs to be done to help hospitals improve sepsis survival rates."We know there's an opportunity to improve the support and structure of sepsis programs in hospitals across the country, and CDC is ready to help hospitals measure the success of their programs as they implement these core elements," Cohen said. Small study suggests many more people have long COVID than previously believed News brief Mary Van Beusekom, MS Topics COVID-19 A study using SARS-CoV-2 antibody and T-cell tests shows that 41% of 29 patients who developed a postviral syndrome (PVS) showed evidence of a previous COVID-19 infection, suggesting that millions of Americans with long COVID symptoms were exposed to the virus early in the pandemic but couldn't access testing. Northwestern University researchers published the results yesterday in Neurology Neuroimmunology & Neuroinflammation. The team measured SARS-CoV-2 humoral and cell-mediated immune responses against nucleocapsid and spike proteins in 29 PVS patients after suspected COVID-19, 32 age- and sex-matched neurologic long-COVID patients, and 18 uninfected controls. They retrospectively evaluated neurologic signs and symptoms, chronic conditions, quality of life, and cognitive testing data collected at clinic visits. Potentially 4 million hidden long-COVID patients Of 29 PVS patients, 12 (41%) had detectable humoral or cellular immune responses consistent with previous COVID-19 infection. Of the 12, 75% had anti-nucleocapsid responses, 50% had anti-spike responses, and all had similar neurologic symptoms as neurologic long-COVID patients but weren't clinically assessed an average 5.3 months later after symptom onset (10.7 vs 5.4 months). PVS and neurologic long-COVID patients had similarly impaired quality of life, including worse cognitive function and fatigue. PVS patients had similar results in objective cognitive measures of processing speed, attention, and executive function but better working memory than neurologic long-COVID patients. About 70% of post-COVID clinics in the U.S. do not accept people with long COVID symptoms who do not have a positive test result for COVID. The study authors said the results highlight "the importance of multitargeted COVID-19 immunologic evaluation and the limitations of commercially available diagnostic tests." They added that a lack of COVID-19 diagnosis probably delayed care for PVS patients. "Unlike our clinic, about 70% of post-COVID clinics in the U.S. do not accept people with long COVID symptoms who do not have a positive test result for COVID," senior author Igor Koralnik, MD, said in an American Academy of Neurology press release. "Our data suggest that at least four million people with post-viral syndrome similar to long COVID may indeed have detectable immune responses to support a COVID diagnosis," he added. "More research is needed to confirm our findings." West Nile remains most common mosquito-borne disease in US News brief Stephanie Soucheray, MA Topics West Nile CDC / James Gathany Today in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, researchers using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) arthropod-borne disease surveillance data confirm that West Nile virus remains the most common mosquito-borne disease in the United States, with almost 3,000 cases reported in 2021. The surveillance data shows 3,035 cases of domestic arthropod-borne diseases, including 2,911 of West Nile, 40 cases of La Crosse, 32 cases of Jamestown Canyon, 24 cases of Powassan virus, 17 cases of St. Louis encephalitis, 5 cases of eastern equine encephalitis, and 6 cases of an unspecified California serogroup virus. All cases were reported from all states except Hawaii and the District of Columbia, with 16% of all US counties reporting at least one case of arboviral disease. Of the West Nile virus cases noted, 2,008 (69%) were classified as neuroinvasive, which included cases reporting encephalitis (64%), meningitis (30%), and acute flaccid paralysis (2%). Cases were reported from 432 counties in 49 states and the District of Columbia, with most seasonally reported (71%) during July, August, and September. Arizona outbreak increased case counts "Most patients with neuroinvasive disease (1,907; 95%) were hospitalized and 225 (11%) died," the authors wrote. Arizona had the largest number of neuroinvasive cases (1,140), or 57% of all US cases. The activity in Arizona made 2021 the most active year for West Nile in the United States since 2012. "Reasons for the outbreak likely included late-season rain, recent population growth and housing development, and low levels of WNV [West Nile virus] circulation during the preceding year,” the authors wrote. They said continued surveillance is needed, as there are no treatments for West Nile virus. Flu tails off in Southern Hemisphere, rises in some Asian regions News brief Lisa Schnirring Topics Influenza, General Global flu levels remain low, with activity leveling off in many Southern Hemisphere countries, the World Health Organization (WHO) said this week in its latest update, which covers roughly the last week of July and the first week of August. Southeast Asia's flu levels remained elevated, including in Cambodia, Myanmar, and the Philippines, mainly due to a mix of influenza A strains. In South Asia, flu activity remained low in most of the region, except for Bangladesh and Bhutan. In East Asia, Hong Kong's activity remained near the epidemic threshold. However, today Hong Kong's Centre for Health Protection said local activity has increased over the past week, putting levels above the seasonal threshold and marking the start of its summer flu season. In tropical Africa, flu activity increased in Ethiopia and Madagascar, but declined in other countries. Elsewhere, influenza B detections increased in Cuba. Of respiratory samples that tested positive for flu at national flu labs during the surveillance period, 72.7% were influenza A, and of subtyped influenza A samples, 62.4% were the H3N2 strain and 37.6% were 2009 H1N1. Of characterized influenza B samples, all belonged to the Victoria lineage. Study shows artemisinin-resistant malaria is spreading in Uganda News brief Chris Dall, MA Topics Antimicrobial Stewardship Malaria CDC New data from Uganda indicate that artemisinin-resistant malaria is on the rise, researchers report today in the New England Journal of Medicine. For the study, a team of researchers from Uganda and the United States performed annual surveillance among patients who presented with uncomplicated malaria caused by the Plasmodium falciparum parasite at 10 to 16 sites across Uganda from 2016 through 2022. They were looking to assess the prevalence of malaria isolates containing mutations in the kelch protein K13 (pfK13), which mediates partial resistance to artemisinin—the main component of the standard therapy for uncomplicated malaria across Africa. Partial resistance can delay parasite clearance. Artemisinin and artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs) have greatly contributed to reductions in malaria deaths and complications, particularly in Africa, where 95% of malaria cases and deaths occur. The analysis found that, by 2021-2022, the prevalence of parasites with validated or candidate resistance markers reached more than 20% in 11 of the 16 districts where surveillance was conducted. Two pfk13 mutations—469Y and 675V—reached a combined prevalence of 10% to 54% across much of northern Uganda, with spread to other regions, while the 469F mutation reached a prevalence of 38% to 40% in one district in southwestern Uganda in 2021-2022. Two other mutations (561H and 441L) also increased in prevalence in districts in southwestern and western Uganda. Multiple PfK13 mutations, including five candidate or validated resistance markers, have shown increased prevalence and spread over time. "Overall, multiple PfK13 mutations, including five candidate or validated resistance markers, have shown increased prevalence and spread over time," the study authors wrote. Treatment could be compromised The authors add that while the full clinical consequences of these genetic changes are not yet known, the experience in Southeast Asia, where resistance to artemisinin and ACTs has become widespread, suggests that malaria treatment in Uganda may be compromised. "Improved characterization of the emergence and spread of artemisinin resistance and of factors that facilitate spread will assist policymakers in developing strategies to limit the spread and consequences of drug resistance," they wrote.

This story also ran on USA Today. It can be republished for free. Yes, inevitably, it’s time to think about the usual suspects — influenza and covid-19 shots — but also the new kid in town: recently approved vaccines for RSV, short for respiratory syncytial virus. But who should get the various vaccines, and when? “For the eligible populations, all three shots are highly recommended,” said Georges Benjamin, a physician and the executive director of the American Public Health Association. Still, there’s no need to get them all at the same time, and there are reasons to wait a bit for two of them. Some people may also face cost issues. Let’s break this down. Email Sign-Up Subscribe to KFF Health News' free Morning Briefing. Your Email Address Sign Up What’s the Price? It depends on the vaccine — and on your insurance coverage. For covid shots, including the updated ones expected to be available this fall, most people will still be able to get the vaccines for free. People became accustomed to that no-cost availability during the pandemic, but the federal government stopped picking up the entire tab with the end of the public health emergency this spring. Now the actual cost of the vaccine, which manufacturers said could be far higher than what the government paid during the pandemic, will be borne by private insurers and Medicare and Medicaid. For people without insurance, the Biden administration set up the Bridge Access Program, which will make free vaccines available this fall through community health centers and state health departments. Eventually, retail pharmacies may also participate. Pfizer and Moderna, two of the companies producing updated covid vaccines, previously suggested they would charge $110 to $130 per dose, and plan to offer programs for people who cannot afford the vaccines. In July, the Biden administration urged both makers to set a “reasonable” rate for the updated versions. Another company, Novavax, has said it will also have an updated vaccine for the U.S. market. It is still unclear how prices will shake out. In a recent Moderna earnings call, company officials indicated they are negotiating contracts with payers but did not give per-dose figures. The company expects covid vaccine sales worldwide to tally $6 billion to $8 billion this year. The Affordable Care Act says patients don’t have to pay for certain preventive care, including some vaccines. That means flu shots are offered at no cost to people with insurance, including those on Medicare and Medicaid. Those without insurance may be able to land a free or low-cost shot from some health centers and state health departments. The cost of the flu vaccine depends on the type of shot and the pharmacy or medical outlet providing it but can range from $20 to more than $70. Similar rules apply to the new RSV vaccines, which may carry a price tag between $180 and $295 a shot. Because they are recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, they are covered for people with private insurance without a copay. The Inflation Reduction Act did the same for Medicare beneficiaries and provided incentives for states to follow suit with Medicaid. Still, Medicare beneficiaries should note that the RSV vaccine is covered under Part D of the program, so those who have not signed up for the drug benefit may have to pay out-of-pocket. It may take a while for insurers to list the RSV vaccine on their formularies, so patients are advised to check their health plans before making an appointment. The uninsured, however, will need to turn to low-cost clinics or health departments, although those programs may vary. Such lack of access “means we will have another health disparity for people who can’t afford it,” said Benjamin, of the public health association. Luckily, most of those seeking the shot are likely to be on Medicare, which will cover it, he said. “But if you are 60 to 65 and not yet on Medicare, you might have some challenges.” RSV Vaccines The newest of the vaccines target RSV, a common respiratory illness. The season for RSV infections usually begins in the fall and lasts into the spring, potentially peaking in January and February. The CDC estimates that 60,000 to 160,000 people 65 and older are hospitalized because of RSV annually, with approximately 6,000 to 10,000 deaths among that age group. Infants and older adults are most at risk. Risk factors for having a more severe case include increased age, but also underlying conditions like lung diseases, cardiovascular problems like congestive heart failure, diabetes, and kidney and liver disorders, and being immunocompromised. The illness can also aggravate existing conditions such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The two new vaccines have been approved for older adults, with the CDC’s vaccine advisory panel saying people 60 or older should be able to get one of them if they and their doctor or other medical provider agree it would be a good precaution. If you fall into those categories, don’t wait too long, said William Schaffner, a physician and professor of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University. “That’s one you can do and get out of the way right now.” Those who get one of the new RSV vaccines now should take a brief pause of at least two weeks before getting any other vaccination because there isn’t much data on whether they interact with other shots when received concurrently, he said. The effectiveness of the RSV vaccines in preventing severe disease is expected to remain high through this year’s RSV season, and they may also provide some protection the following year, based on information from the clinical trials. In early August a new monoclonal antibody, which contains lab-made antibodies against RSV, was approved for infants under 8 months and certain other young children, and it should be available soon. The shot is similar to a vaccine, but it works faster because it supplies the antibodies itself rather than spurring a baby’s immune system to produce them. Among children under 5, RSV causes 58,000 to 80,000 hospitalizations and 100 to 300 deaths each year, according to the CDC. On Monday, the FDA approved Pfizer’s RSV vaccine to be given during pregnancy to convey protection to infants after they are born until they are 6 months old. It isn’t yet known when the vaccine will become available or the specific recommendations the CDC will make about who should get it. As with any drug or vaccine, side effects are possible with any of the new shots, including pain at the injection site, headache, fatigue, and some other, rarer side effects. “It’s always good to sit down and talk with your doctor. They know your medical history,” said Mahdee Sobhanie, an infectious diseases physician at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. Covid and Influenza Vaccines Both covid and flu shots are worth getting, but it might be a good idea to wait a little bit. One reason is that updated covid shots awaiting approval are formulated to work against strains more commonly circulating now, known as the XBB lineage. The boosters will not directly target the new “Eris” variant currently rising in the U.S., though Eris is considered a descendant of XBB. If approved, the updated vaccines are expected to become available around late September. When to get vaccinated can be confusing, with the seasonality of the illnesses varying a bit. Flu season usually starts in late fall and runs into spring. We have fewer years’ data on covid, but it appears to vary with the seasons, too, with upticks in winter when people gather inside, but also during hot summer months, when people are more likely to seek air-conditioned indoor venues. With the updated covid vaccines expected in the next couple of months, patients should be able to get a covid vaccination and an influenza shot at the same time, said Schaffner. “We have good info they don’t interact,” he said. The influenza vaccine is designed to last through the season, but effectiveness can wane. For that reason, even though you might start seeing ads in August, many experts suggest waiting until the end of September or early October to get a flu shot. “If you get it too early, it might not cover you too well toward the end of the season,” Schaffner said.

Yes, inevitably, it’s time to think about the usual suspects — influenza and covid-19 shots — but also the new kid in town: recently approved vaccines for RSV, short for respiratory syncytial virus. But who should get the various vaccines, and when? “For the eligible populations, all three shots are highly recommended,” said Georges Benjamin, a physician and the executive director of the American Public Health Association. Still, there’s no need to get them all at the same time, and there are reasons to wait a bit for two of them. Some people may also face cost issues. Let’s break this down. What’s the Price? It depends on the vaccine — and on your insurance coverage. For covid shots, including the updated ones expected to be available this fall, most people will still be able to get the vaccines for free. People became accustomed to that no-cost availability during the pandemic, but the federal government stopped picking up the entire tab with the end of the public health emergency this spring. Now the actual cost of the vaccine, which manufacturers said could be far higher than what the government paid during the pandemic, will be borne by private insurers and Medicare and Medicaid. For people without insurance, the Biden administration set up the Bridge Access Program, which will make free vaccines available this fall through community health centers and state health departments. Eventually, retail pharmacies may also participate. Pfizer and Moderna, two of the companies producing updated covid vaccines, previously suggested they would charge $110 to $130 per dose, and plan to offer programs for people who cannot afford the vaccines. In July, the Biden administration urged both makers to set a “reasonable” rate for the updated versions. Another company, Novavax, has said it will also have an updated vaccine for the U.S. market. It is still unclear how prices will shake out. In a recent Moderna earnings call, company officials indicated they are negotiating contracts with payers but did not give per-dose figures. The company expects covid vaccine sales worldwide to tally $6 billion to $8 billion this year. The Affordable Care Act says patients don’t have to pay for certain preventive care, including some vaccines. That means flu shots are offered at no cost to people with insurance, including those on Medicare and Medicaid. Those without insurance may be able to land a free or low-cost shot from some health centers and state health departments. The cost of the flu vaccine depends on the type of shot and the pharmacy or medical outlet providing it but can range from $20 to more than $70. Similar rules apply to the new RSV vaccines, which may carry a price tag between $180 and $295 a shot. Because they are recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, they are covered for people with private insurance without a copay. The Inflation Reduction Act did the same for Medicare beneficiaries and provided incentives for states to follow suit with Medicaid. Still, Medicare beneficiaries should note that the RSV vaccine is covered under Part D of the program, so those who have not signed up for the drug benefit may have to pay out-of-pocket. It may take a while for insurers to list the RSV vaccine on their formularies, so patients are advised to check their health plans before making an appointment. The uninsured, however, will need to turn to low-cost clinics or health departments, although those programs may vary. Such lack of access “means we will have another health disparity for people who can’t afford it,” said Benjamin, of the public health association. Luckily, most of those seeking the shot are likely to be on Medicare, which will cover it, he said. “But if you are 60 to 65 and not yet on Medicare, you might have some challenges.” RSV Vaccines The newest of the vaccines target RSV, a common respiratory illness. The season for RSV infections usually begins in the fall and lasts into the spring, potentially peaking in January and February. The CDC estimates that 60,000 to 160,000 people 65 and older are hospitalized because of RSV annually, with approximately 6,000 to 10,000 deaths among that age group. Infants and older adults are most at risk. Risk factors for having a more severe case include increased age, but also underlying conditions like lung diseases, cardiovascular problems like congestive heart failure, diabetes, and kidney and liver disorders, and being immunocompromised. The illness can also aggravate existing conditions such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The two new vaccines have been approved for older adults, with the CDC’s vaccine advisory panel saying people 60 or older should be able to get one of them if they and their doctor or other medical provider agree it would be a good precaution. If you fall into those categories, don’t wait too long, said William Schaffner, a physician and professor of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University. “That’s one you can do and get out of the way right now.” Those who get one of the new RSV vaccines now should take a brief pause of at least two weeks before getting any other vaccination because there isn’t much data on whether they interact with other shots when received concurrently, he said. The effectiveness of the RSV vaccines in preventing severe disease is expected to remain high through this year’s RSV season, and they may also provide some protection the following year, based on information from the clinical trials. In early August a new monoclonal antibody, which contains lab-made antibodies against RSV, was approved for infants under 8 months and certain other young children, and it should be available soon. The shot is similar to a vaccine, but it works faster because it supplies the antibodies itself rather than spurring a baby’s immune system to produce them. Among children under 5, RSV causes 58,000 to 80,000 hospitalizations and 100 to 300 deaths each year, according to the CDC. On Monday, the FDA approved Pfizer’s RSV vaccine to be given during pregnancy to convey protection to infants after they are born until they are 6 months old. It isn’t yet known when the vaccine will become available or the specific recommendations the CDC will make about who should get it. As with any drug or vaccine, side effects are possible with any of the new shots, including pain at the injection site, headache, fatigue, and some other, rarer side effects. “It’s always good to sit down and talk with your doctor. They know your medical history,” said Mahdee Sobhanie, an infectious diseases physician at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. Covid and Influenza Vaccines Both covid and flu shots are worth getting, but it might be a good idea to wait a little bit. One reason is that updated covid shots awaiting approval are formulated to work against strains more commonly circulating now, known as the XBB lineage. The boosters will not directly target the new “Eris” variant currently rising in the U.S., though Eris is considered a descendant of XBB. If approved, the updated vaccines are expected to become available around late September. When to get vaccinated can be confusing, with the seasonality of the illnesses varying a bit. Flu season usually starts in late fall and runs into spring. We have fewer years’ data on covid, but it appears to vary with the seasons, too, with upticks in winter when people gather inside, but also during hot summer months, when people are more likely to seek air-conditioned indoor venues. With the updated covid vaccines expected in the next couple of months, patients should be able to get a covid vaccination and an influenza shot at the same time, said Schaffner. “We have good info they don’t interact,” he said. The influenza vaccine is designed to last through the season, but effectiveness can wane. For that reason, even though you might start seeing ads in August, many experts suggest waiting until the end of September or early October to get a flu shot. “If you get it too early, it might not cover you too well toward the end of the season,” Schaffner said.

ADVERTISEMENTFinland, Europe's leading producer of fox fur, has begun slaughtering 120,000 foxes and mink to stem an outbreak of avian flu that has hit fur farms, the authorities announced on Wednesday."A culling order has been issued for 13 farms," Tuija Gadd, head of the Finnish food authority's virology unit, told the AFP press agency, adding that "Culling has already been carried out on 10 farms."In June, several outbreaks of H5N1 avian influenza were identified among larids in Finland. The first cases in fur farms were detected in July.Given these findings, the Finnish authorities decided at the beginning of August to cull a large proportion of the animals on farms affected by the epidemic.Stop the spreadSince the end of 2021, Europe has been facing its worst ever outbreak of avian flu, with North and South America also hard hit.In mid-July, the World Health Organisation expressed concern that the increase in cases of avian flu among mammals could make it easier for the virus to spread to humans.Finland has around 400 fur farms, according to Ms Gadd, with a total population 1.3 million animals, mainly mink and foxes.The epidemic seems to be "calming down", she believes, as gulls and seagulls have begun their migration southwards.The increase in the number of cases of avian flu has rekindled calls for a ban on the fur industry in the Nordic country, with Finland producing almost a million pelts each year.During the Covid-19 pandemic, Denmark became embroiled in a political crisis after illegally ordering a mass slaughter of 15 million mink to prevent mutations of the virus.Finland's fur industry has been the subject of increasing criticism in recent years.An investigation last year by animal rights group Oikeutta Elaimille – 'Justice for Animals' – found that many animals being bred for fur suffer in extremely poor conditions, leaving them vulnerable to injury and disease. Some are fattened and bred to grow to several times their normal size.Go to accessibility shortcutsShare this articleComments You might also like Danish PM Frederiksen's COVID-19 mink cull order had

Hutch and Division of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, UW, and colleagues August 21, 2023 • By L Brady Crowded shelters or densely populated living spaces provide the perfect opportunity for transmission of respiratory viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) - a common respiratory pathogen that can lead to severe infection in infants and older adults - putting an already vulnerable population, people experiencing homelessness, at greater risk of infection. Further exacerbating this risk, is the increase of older adults and the higher level of chronic conditions such as asthma and heart disease, conditions that are associated with more severe infection and hospitalization, among this population. âWe know that many people who are experiencing homelessness have limited access to medical care, and often have medical conditions that put them at higher risk for severe infection with respiratory viruses. Furthermore, they may be at higher risk for acquiring infection due to crowded conditions in shelters. In healthy people, RSV is often a minor illness, with cold-like symptoms, but among vulnerable individuals, it can cause severe disease resulting in hospitalization, and even death,â explained Dr. Denise McCulloch, an Assistant Professor in the Fred Hutch Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division. Dr. McCulloch and colleagues conducted a 3-year study to assess RSV in homeless shelters across King County, Washington during RSV season. Their study, recently published in Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses, described RSV cases, symptoms, and crossover with other seasonal respiratory viruses in people experiencing homelessness. The researchers enrolled participants into this study by utilizing the infrastructure of existing larger studies, the Seattle Flu Study, and a randomized controlled trial for influenza testing in shelters. Participants ranged in age from 3 months to 97 years old. Asthma was reported as the most common co-morbidity, and 54% of adult encounters reported tobacco use, an additional risk factor for poorer health outcomes. Of the 35 RSV cases detected, 26% involved co-infection with another respiratory virus, most commonly influenza. Notably, the most frequently reported symptoms for both RSV and influenza were the same, cough and rhinorrhea (runny nose), emphasizing the difficulty in distinguishing between viruses without confirmatory testing. Moreover, many study participants reported how their RSV infection affected their ability to go about their daily activities, with several requiring doctor or emergency room visits. 26% of RSV infections involved co-infection with another respiratory virus. Figure provided by Dr. McCulloch Summarizing how Dr. McCulloch hopes the results from the present study will impact access to future RSV testing for vulnerable populations, she said âour findings underscore the difficulty of clinically distinguishing infections caused by RSV and flu, particularly during the peak winter respiratory virus season, when multiple viruses are circulating. I often see newspaper headlines saying things like, âHow to know if your cold is the fluâ, but in reality, there is so much overlap in the symptoms caused by these viruses, that testing is critical, especially for people most at risk for severe disease. So in the same way that testing for Covid has become more widely available over the past two years, I hope the same will soonÂ be true for RSV.â Going forward Dr. McCulloch and colleagues are focused on improving testing capabilities for vulnerable populations, those most at risk, and their communities. âWe know that timely and accurate testing for respiratory viruses is important. As providers, and as a healthcare system, we are generally pretty good about testing our immunocompromised patients for respiratory viruses, but testing for their families, caregivers, and medical teams is much more limited,â said Dr. McCulloch. âIn the future Iâm interested in exploring how additional testing for the close contacts of immunocompromised patients could be a tool to help protect them from infection and to identify and interrupt outbreaks early in their course,â she concluded.Â This work was funded by support from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Gates Ventures, and theÂ National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the National Institutes of Health.

Rittika Choudhury 24-08- 2023 05:54 PM Pix credit//power.bi.com ACCORDING to reports from The World Health Organisation (WHO), influenza cases have recently been on the rise in Malaysia, raising concerns in particular among people aged 60 and older. Hence, it was reported by the Ministry of Health that 93 influenza clusters were recorded nationwide as of the 23rd Epidemiological Week (4â10 June), a 21 per cent rise from 2022. Based on Datuk Dr. Christopher Lee, a former deputy director general of health (research & technical support), vulnerable populations like the elderly may have more severe effects from influenza. âMany Malaysians lack immunity to the virus, which is contagious all year round. Sadly, a lot of people still believe that immunisations are only for new-borns and very young children. Though adults can also benefit from immunisations, he added, particularly elderly people who may come into contact with their adult children and grandkids can get infected, especially if they share a homeâ. It is reported due to their declining immune system, it makes it more difficult to fight infections, as well as health issues. Additionally, only two to three per cent of Malaysians were said to have received an influenza vaccination. As we all know, getting vaccinated against the flu helps to avoid significant cardiovascular health issues or even death. Therefore, it is crucial for those 60 years of age and older to visit their nearby clinic as soon as possible to obtain their immunisations. Dr. Zaliha Mustafa, the minister of health, stressed the significance of providing free annual influenza vaccinations to protect peopleâs health, especially the elderly, according to NST. At-risk groups, including seniors 60 and older, are already given free influenza vaccines in nations including Singapore, Thailand, and Korea. Moreover, the influenza vaccination has been available for more than 70 years, and substantial study has been done to demonstrate its safety record to the general public, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO). Be cautious of illnesses that may appear to be the typical cold but in reality, is the malicious influenza. For both yourself and a loved one, get immunised sooner rather than later.

SK bioscience is making a comeback in the domestic flu shot market after a two-year hiatus, during which the company focused on producing its Covid-19 vaccine SKYCovione. Now, with flu cases surging across the country in a rare occurrence and the crisis level for Covid-19 set to be further downgraded, things are up and running again on the production lines for SK bioscience’s SKYCellflu, a cell-based quadrivalent influenza vaccine. Pre-filled syringes of SKYCellflu influenza vaccine on the packaging line at SK bioscience’s Andong L House manufacturing plant in North Gyeongsang on Tuesday [SHIN HA-NEE] “While flu season is usually [from November] until April, this season’s influenza activity is still there even in the summer,” Kim Gi-hyeon, head of the medical information team at SK bioscience, told the press on Tuesday at the Andong L House, the company’s vaccine manufacturing center in North Gyeongsang. “Considering this trend, we expect the burden of the disease will continuously grow,” Kim added. The unusual trend for the late spring and summer outbreak is likely due to the removal of the indoor mask mandate. Herd immunity against influenza viruses, usually built during the winter at the peak of flu season, was not sufficiently established this year due to the mask mandate, resulting in weaker immunity against the seasonal flu. When journalists visited the Andong L House on Tuesday, millions of doses of influenza vaccines were being readied for shipment. Five-milliliter syringes filled with SKYCelllflu were waiting on the production line as machines busily ran automated quality checks and packed syringes in boxes. Package after package was being stacked, while employees in clean room garments moved the boxes, each filled with 150,000 doses of flu shots, to prepare them for shipping. SK bioscience's SKYCellflu influenza vaccine [SK BIOSCIENCE] Starting Wednesday, SK bioscience will supply some 5 million doses of SKYCellflu vaccines across the country until October. SKYCellflu, launched in 2016, was granted the World Health Organization's first-ever pre-qualification certification for a cell-cultured quadrivalent influenza vaccine in 2019. It is currently the only cell-based vaccine available in Korea. There are two types of technologies for producing influenza vaccines: Egg-based and cell-based. Traditional egg-based flu vaccines, which take up a majority of the market, are made with fertilized chicken eggs by injecting candidate vaccine viruses before harvesting virus antigens from the egg. Meanwhile, cell-based vaccines are made with cultured animal cells. The cell-based technology could possibly improve the vaccine's effectiveness, as growing influenza viruses in eggs may cause egg-adapted changes that result in a difference between the virus in the vaccine products and the actual flu virus circulating during the season. As such, Britain’s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation suggested in a statement on influenza vaccines for the 2023/24 season that “there is a potential advantage to using influenza vaccines which do not use eggs in the manufacturing process [cell-culture or recombinant] compared with egg-cultured influenza vaccines, due to the possible impact of ‘egg-adaptation’ on the effectiveness of influenza vaccines.” An employee with a syringe of SK bioscience's SKYCellflu influenza vaccine[SK BIOSCIENCE] Moreover, cell-based vaccines are safe for people with egg allergies, and as the production of cell-based vaccines is not dependent on egg supply, aligning production with demand is easier for cell culture vaccines. “Egg-based vaccines are usually referred to as more classic ones, whereas cell-based vaccines are often dubbed the next-generation,” said Lee Sang-gyun, SK bioscience senior vice president and chief of the Andong L House. SK’s SKYCellflu is priced almost on par with the traditional egg-based flu shots in the market, Lee added. SKYCellflu is the leading flu shot market in Korea and received approval from 10 countries including Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore and Mongolia. The Andong L House measures 62,626 square meters (15.5 acres), with a 99,130-square-meter site expansion underway. The plant can produce up to 500 million vaccine doses annually.

An analysis of electronic medical records for more than 45,000 people found that COVID-19 infection was significantly associated with the development of high blood pressure, according to new research published Aug. 21 in Hypertension, an American Heart Association journal. Image courtesy: Getty Images. August 22, 2023 — An analysis of electronic medical records for more than 45,000 people found that COVID-19 infection was significantly associated with the development of high blood pressure, according to newly-published research in Hypertension, an American Heart Association (AHA) journal. An AHA news summary reporting the findings from “Incidence of New-Onset Hypertension Post–COVID-19: Comparison with Influenza,” noted two additional key research highlights: People with COVID-19 infection and no history of high blood pressure were significantly more likely to develop persistent high blood pressure compared to people with the influenza virus; also, notably, people with COVID-19 who are over age 40, men, black adults or those with preexisting conditions, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary artery disease or chronic kidney disease, had an elevated risk of developing high blood pressure, according to the study. “While COVID-19 is typically more severe in patients with preexisting high blood pressure, including higher rates of hospitalization and mortality compared to people with normal blood pressure, it is unknown whether the SARS-CoV-2 virus may trigger the development of high blood pressure or worsen preexisting hypertension,” said senior study author Tim Q. Duong, Ph.D., professor of radiology and vice chair for radiology research and associate director of Integrative Imaging and Data Science at the Center for Health and Data Innovation (CHDI) at Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Montefiore Health System in New York City. “Given the sheer number of people affected by COVID-19 compared to influenza, these statistics are alarming and suggest that many more patients will likely develop high blood pressure in the future, which may present a major public health burden,” Duong said. He added, “These findings should heighten awareness to screen at-risk patients for hypertension after COVID-19 illness to enable earlier identification and treatment for hypertension-related complications, such as cardiovascular and kidney disease.” About the Study This retrospective observational study is the first to investigate the development and risk factors associated with persistent high blood pressure in people with COVID-19 infection compared to influenza, a similar respiratory virus. Health data were analyzed from electronic medical records at the Montefiore Health System in Bronx, New York, which serves a large, racially and ethnically diverse population. The study included 45,398 people with COVID-19 — hospitalized between March 1, 2020 and February 20, 2022 — and 13,864 people with influenza without COVID-19 — hospitalized between January 2018 and February 20, 2022 — who returned to the hospital system for any medical reasons within an average follow-up period of six months. The researchers' analysis also found the following: - 21% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 and 11% of those who were not hospitalized for COVID-19 developed high blood pressure, compared to 16% of people hospitalized with influenza and 4% of those not hospitalized for influenza. - People hospitalized for COVID-19 were more than twice as likely and those not hospitalized are 1.5 times more likely to develop persistent hypertension compared to people hospitalized and non-hospitalized with influenza, respectively. - People infected with SARS-CoV-2 who were over 40 years old, Black adults or those with preexisting conditions, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary artery disease or chronic kidney disease, had an elevated risk of developing high blood pressure. - Persistent high blood pressure was more common among people infected with SARS-CoV-2 who were treated with vasopressor and corticosteroid medications during the pandemic. Analysis and Background The authors noted that the people in the study were primarily from communities with low socioeconomic status, which may increase their susceptibility to developing high blood pressure after COVID-19 infection. Other factors may also have contributed to the development of high blood pressure in the study patients, including the effects of isolation, psychosocial stress, reduced physical activity, unhealthy diet and weight gain during the COVID-19 pandemic. Researchers also noted that longer follow-up studies will be needed to determine whether the effects of COVID-19-related complications on the heart and blood pressure regulation may resolve on their own, or if there may be long-lasting effects on patients’ cardiovascular systems. Additional background was reported in the news summary, including: Participants included 45,398 COVID-19 patients hospitalized between March 2020 to August 2022 and 13,864 influenza patients hospitalized between January 2018 to August 2022 without a history of hypertension. Health data came from the Montefiore Health System, which includes multiple hospitals located in New York Metropolitan area in the Bronx and surrounding communities that serves a large, diverse patient population, including many patients with lower social economic status. The Bronx and the greater New York City boroughs were an epicenter of SARS-CoV-2 infection early in the pandemic. Data was collected upon COVID-19 hospital admission and at follow-up. The follow-up was within 3 and 9 months after COVID-19 or influenza positive test, with the one closest to 6 months taken for both COVID-19 and influenza patients. Co-authors with Duong include Vincent Zhang, Molly Fisher, DO, Wei Hou, Lili Zhang, MD, Department of Medicine, Division of Cardiology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York. According to the 2017 ACC/AHA Guideline for the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Management of High Blood Pressure in Adults, hypertension is classified as having top and bottom numbers greater than or equal to 130/80 mm Hg.

A SK bioscience employee packing SKY Cellflu Quadrivalent Prefilled Syringe at the company’s Andong L House in Andong, North Gyeongsang Province, Tuesday. (credit: SK bioscience) SK bioscience had previously suspended production of SKY Cellflu for the past two years to ensure a smooth supply of SKYCovione, its Covid-19 vaccines. However, with the Covid-19 outbreak entering an endemic phase, SK bioscience has resumed production of SKY Cellflu in anticipation of a sharp increase in the incidence of flu this year along with the lifting of social distancing and indoor masks. The vaccines will be shipped from the company's manufacturing facility, Andong L House, located in Andong, North Gyeongsang Province, from Wednesday. SK bioscience plans to supply approximately 5 million doses of the influenza vaccine in Korea until early next year, and the vaccine will be available for administration in hospitals and clinics from next month. According to the company, SKY Cellflu is Korea's first influenza vaccine to achieve the WHO's Pre-qualification (PQ) certification and is the only cell-cultured-based influenza vaccine available in Korea. Aside from SKY Cellflu, all other vaccines used in Korea are produced using egg-based methods, which cultivate the virus in fertilized eggs. "As the cell-culture method does not utilize eggs, it is a relatively safer option for those with egg allergies," the company said. "Also, compared to the egg-based production, the cell-cultured process has a shorter production time, allowing for rapid production during an influenza outbreak." The advanced aseptic culturing equipment used in the cell-cultured approach also eliminates the need for antibiotics and preservatives, and experts suggest that not using these additional ingredients reduces the likelihood of allergic reactions post-vaccination, it added. The company stressed that another beneficial factor of using the cell-cultured approach is its efficacy consistency. "Typically, flu vaccines are produced annually based on the WHO's predicted list of prevalent influenza strains for that year," the company said. "However, the possibility of virus mutation during the egg-based vaccine production is relatively higher, while cell-cultured vaccines tend to have a lower chance of mutation from the actual prevalent virus strains." Studies abroad have also confirmed that vaccines produced using the cell-cultured methods have a lower potential for mutation, ensuring more consistent efficacy, it added. The company provided data from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that compared the egg-based vaccine with the cell-cultured vaccine from 2017-2018 as an example. "The results showed that the cell-cultured quadrivalent flu vaccine showed an 11 percent higher efficacy in preventing influenza-realted hospital encouters compared to its egg-based counterpart," SK bioscience said. "Following these results, the U.K.'s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation recently released guidelines recommending the quadrivalent cell-cultured influenza vaccine for those aged two to 64." A SK bioscience official holds up the packaged SKY Cellflu Quadrivalent Prefilled Syringe vaccine at the company’s Andong L House in Andong, North Gyeongsang Province, Tuesday. (Credit: Korea Biomedical Review) SK bioscience's Andong L House General Manager Lee Sang-gyun also stressed that cell-cultured influenza vaccines will become the new normal for influence vaccines in the near future. "The WHO had already forecasted the shift from egg-based flu vaccines to cell-cultured ones back in the 2000s," Lee said. "However, various vaccine makers, including multinational pharmaceutical giants like Sanofi and GSK, have yet to transition to cell-cultured production due to the immense costs involved in altering their substantial pre-existing infrastructure, which is focused on the egg-based method." In this light, SK bioscience, being a latecomer, had the advantage of directly adopting the cell-cultured technique from the start, Lee added. Lee also stressed that while some foreign companies succeeded in acquiring cell-cultured technology, they failed to commercialize due to yield issues. "SKY Cellflu embodies the advanced vaccine technology of Korea," Lee said. "Through its reintroduction to the market, it will broaden the vaccine choices for our citizens and reassert our vaccine's competitiveness in the global market." tweet Related articles JW Shinyak to resume marketing of SK bioscience’s flu vaccine SK bioscience, GC go head-to-head to expand influenza vaccine market share SK bioscience strikes deal with Serbian gov’t to establish vaccine localization partnership SK bioscience seeks emergency use of updated Novavax Covid-19 vaccine in Korea SK bioscience, Hilleman Laboratories join forces to develop low-cost Ebola vaccine Lee Han-soo corea022@docdocdoc.co.kr See Other Articles Copyright © KBR Unauthorized reproduction, redistribution prohibited News That You Haven't Seen Mediwhale wins 1st place in MICCAI’s medical AI competition Falls and trips, primary reasons for older adults’ injuries, while youngsters must be careful about electric scooters [Interview] ‘Pediatric care will revive, so don't give up and stay with us’ Potential new cure found for treating glioblastoma resistant to immunotherapy Macular degeneration cases mark a 2.5-fold increase in 5 years Huons to acquire PanGen Biotech to boost biopharma R&D, CDMO biz Philips Korea to launch digital pathology reference site at Seoul Clinical Laboratories Mediwhale wins 1st place in MICCAI’s medical AI competition Comments Log In 작성자 비밀번호 댓글 내용입력 0 / 400 Submit 댓글 정렬 Newest Recommended Top Comments BEST Comments BEST Comments It is automatically exposed by adding up the number of replies and recommendations. 닫기 More Delete comments Deleted comments cannot be recovered.

The CDC estimates that at least 1.7 million Americans develop sepsis each year, and at least 350,000 adults who develop sepsis during their hospitalization die or are moved into hospice. Survival and recovery from sepsis requires rapid identification, action, and coordination from multiple hospital departments, CDC Director Mandy Cohen, MD, MPH, said at a news briefing."We know that programs dedicated to the care of patients with sepsis have been successful in saving more lives, reducing the amount of time patients need to stay in the hospital, and cutting healthcare costs," Cohen said. "CDC believes that sepsis programs in every hospital, regardless of size, location, and resources, can strengthen the quality of care delivered to these patients and ensure their survival.Only 55% of hospitals provide for sepsis leadershipFindings from a CDC survey published today in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report found that while 73% of US hospitals have a sepsis committee, only 55% provide dedicated time for sepsis program leaders, which Cohen said is an indication that more works needs to be done to help hospitals improve sepsis survival rates."We know there's an opportunity to improve the support and structure of sepsis programs in hospitals across the country, and CDC is ready to help hospitals measure the success of their programs as they implement these core elements," Cohen said. Small study suggests many more people have long COVID than previously believed News brief Mary Van Beusekom, MS Topics COVID-19 A study using SARS-CoV-2 antibody and T-cell tests shows that 41% of 29 patients who developed a postviral syndrome (PVS) showed evidence of a previous COVID-19 infection, suggesting that millions of Americans with long COVID symptoms were exposed to the virus early in the pandemic but couldn't access testing. Northwestern University researchers published the results yesterday in Neurology Neuroimmunology & Neuroinflammation. The team measured SARS-CoV-2 humoral and cell-mediated immune responses against nucleocapsid and spike proteins in 29 PVS patients after suspected COVID-19, 32 age- and sex-matched neurologic long-COVID patients, and 18 uninfected controls. They retrospectively evaluated neurologic signs and symptoms, chronic conditions, quality of life, and cognitive testing data collected at clinic visits. Potentially 4 million hidden long-COVID patients Of 29 PVS patients, 12 (41%) had detectable humoral or cellular immune responses consistent with previous COVID-19 infection. Of the 12, 75% had anti-nucleocapsid responses, 50% had anti-spike responses, and all had similar neurologic symptoms as neurologic long-COVID patients but weren't clinically assessed an average 5.3 months later after symptom onset (10.7 vs 5.4 months). PVS and neurologic long-COVID patients had similarly impaired quality of life, including worse cognitive function and fatigue. PVS patients had similar results in objective cognitive measures of processing speed, attention, and executive function but better working memory than neurologic long-COVID patients. About 70% of post-COVID clinics in the U.S. do not accept people with long COVID symptoms who do not have a positive test result for COVID. The study authors said the results highlight "the importance of multitargeted COVID-19 immunologic evaluation and the limitations of commercially available diagnostic tests." They added that a lack of COVID-19 diagnosis probably delayed care for PVS patients. "Unlike our clinic, about 70% of post-COVID clinics in the U.S. do not accept people with long COVID symptoms who do not have a positive test result for COVID," senior author Igor Koralnik, MD, said in an American Academy of Neurology press release. "Our data suggest that at least four million people with post-viral syndrome similar to long COVID may indeed have detectable immune responses to support a COVID diagnosis," he added. "More research is needed to confirm our findings." West Nile remains most common mosquito-borne disease in US News brief Stephanie Soucheray, MA Topics West Nile CDC / James Gathany Today in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, researchers using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) arthropod-borne disease surveillance data confirm that West Nile virus remains the most common mosquito-borne disease in the United States, with almost 3,000 cases reported in 2021. The surveillance data shows 3,035 cases of domestic arthropod-borne diseases, including 2,911 of West Nile, 40 cases of La Crosse, 32 cases of Jamestown Canyon, 24 cases of Powassan virus, 17 cases of St. Louis encephalitis, 5 cases of eastern equine encephalitis, and 6 cases of an unspecified California serogroup virus. All cases were reported from all states except Hawaii and the District of Columbia, with 16% of all US counties reporting at least one case of arboviral disease. Of the West Nile virus cases noted, 2,008 (69%) were classified as neuroinvasive, which included cases reporting encephalitis (64%), meningitis (30%), and acute flaccid paralysis (2%). Cases were reported from 432 counties in 49 states and the District of Columbia, with most seasonally reported (71%) during July, August, and September. Arizona outbreak increased case counts "Most patients with neuroinvasive disease (1,907; 95%) were hospitalized and 225 (11%) died," the authors wrote. Arizona had the largest number of neuroinvasive cases (1,140), or 57% of all US cases. The activity in Arizona made 2021 the most active year for West Nile in the United States since 2012. "Reasons for the outbreak likely included late-season rain, recent population growth and housing development, and low levels of WNV [West Nile virus] circulation during the preceding year,” the authors wrote. They said continued surveillance is needed, as there are no treatments for West Nile virus. Flu tails off in Southern Hemisphere, rises in some Asian regions News brief Lisa Schnirring Topics Influenza, General Global flu levels remain low, with activity leveling off in many Southern Hemisphere countries, the World Health Organization (WHO) said this week in its latest update, which covers roughly the last week of July and the first week of August. Southeast Asia's flu levels remained elevated, including in Cambodia, Myanmar, and the Philippines, mainly due to a mix of influenza A strains. In South Asia, flu activity remained low in most of the region, except for Bangladesh and Bhutan. In East Asia, Hong Kong's activity remained near the epidemic threshold. However, today Hong Kong's Centre for Health Protection said local activity has increased over the past week, putting levels above the seasonal threshold and marking the start of its summer flu season. In tropical Africa, flu activity increased in Ethiopia and Madagascar, but declined in other countries. Elsewhere, influenza B detections increased in Cuba. Of respiratory samples that tested positive for flu at national flu labs during the surveillance period, 72.7% were influenza A, and of subtyped influenza A samples, 62.4% were the H3N2 strain and 37.6% were 2009 H1N1. Of characterized influenza B samples, all belonged to the Victoria lineage. Study shows artemisinin-resistant malaria is spreading in Uganda News brief Chris Dall, MA Topics Antimicrobial Stewardship Malaria CDC New data from Uganda indicate that artemisinin-resistant malaria is on the rise, researchers report today in the New England Journal of Medicine. For the study, a team of researchers from Uganda and the United States performed annual surveillance among patients who presented with uncomplicated malaria caused by the Plasmodium falciparum parasite at 10 to 16 sites across Uganda from 2016 through 2022. They were looking to assess the prevalence of malaria isolates containing mutations in the kelch protein K13 (pfK13), which mediates partial resistance to artemisinin—the main component of the standard therapy for uncomplicated malaria across Africa. Partial resistance can delay parasite clearance. Artemisinin and artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs) have greatly contributed to reductions in malaria deaths and complications, particularly in Africa, where 95% of malaria cases and deaths occur. The analysis found that, by 2021-2022, the prevalence of parasites with validated or candidate resistance markers reached more than 20% in 11 of the 16 districts where surveillance was conducted. Two pfk13 mutations—469Y and 675V—reached a combined prevalence of 10% to 54% across much of northern Uganda, with spread to other regions, while the 469F mutation reached a prevalence of 38% to 40% in one district in southwestern Uganda in 2021-2022. Two other mutations (561H and 441L) also increased in prevalence in districts in southwestern and western Uganda. Multiple PfK13 mutations, including five candidate or validated resistance markers, have shown increased prevalence and spread over time. "Overall, multiple PfK13 mutations, including five candidate or validated resistance markers, have shown increased prevalence and spread over time," the study authors wrote. Treatment could be compromised The authors add that while the full clinical consequences of these genetic changes are not yet known, the experience in Southeast Asia, where resistance to artemisinin and ACTs has become widespread, suggests that malaria treatment in Uganda may be compromised. "Improved characterization of the emergence and spread of artemisinin resistance and of factors that facilitate spread will assist policymakers in developing strategies to limit the spread and consequences of drug resistance," they wrote. Quick takes: Older adult RSV vaccine awareness, Antarctica avian flu threat, more H5N1 flu in mammals News brief Lisa Schnirring Topics Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) Avian Influenza (Bird Flu) Many older adults are aware of the new respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine, but interest in getting it varies by factors such as age and underlying health status, according to a new poll this week from the University of Michigan's Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation. Researchers gathered the data in July as part of the National Poll on Healthy Aging. Findings revealed that 52% had heard of the RSV vaccine, with 21% saying they're very interested in getting it and 43% responding that they're somewhat interested. People who rated their health good to excellent were more likely to have heard about the vaccine, and the team found that overall interest in the vaccine rose by age, which they said corresponds to the rising risk from the virus.Animal health experts yesterday warned about the risk of H5N1 avian flu spread to Antarctica's wildlife populations, as the virus continues to spread southward. A team from the World Organization for Animal Health and the UN Food and Agriculture Organization said the circulating H5N1 clade first turned up in South America in Colombia in October 2022 and has devastated wildlife in countries such as Peru and Chile. In just 3 months, the virus spread to the southern tip of South America, with the southernmost detection recently reported in a sea lion in Chile. The risk is substantial that the virus will continue southward to reach Antarctica and its offshore islands, especially with the spring migration of birds from South America to Antarctica. Though little can be done to stop the virus from spreading, the group urged scientists to document mortality events, limit amplification by removing carcasses, and follow biosecurity practices to reduce the risk of humans spreading the virus among the animal populations.In European avian flu developments, Finland recently reported another H5N1 outbreak at a fur farm, which involved a facility housing blue foxes, raising the number of outbreaks at such farms to 25. Also, the country began culling 120,000 foxes and mink at 13 affected fur farms, according to Agence France-Presse. Elsewhere, Russian veterinary officials have confirmed H5N1 in a seal found dead in Sakhalin oblast, according to an official statement translated and posted by Avian Flu Diary, an infectious disease news blog. Sakhalin oblast is in far eastern Russia, just north of Japan.

The actress' 4-year-old daughter Tara got hospitalized due to the Influenza A virus. Mahhi revealed in her new posts the symptoms Tara suffered from and warned parents to be careful with their children and advised them what to do. Take a look: Mahhi Vij revealed in her new post how she went through a stressful time after daughter Tara got down with a high fever on August 17. She shared that the fever refused to subside despite all medication and it led them to rush her to the hospital. It was then diagnosed that she was infected with Influenza A.Mahhi recalled in her post the symptoms that Tara, who is just 4-year-old, got.She wrote, "Fevers worry parents, they scare them sometimes. I understand why, because when Tara got high fever on this Thursday night, it was like a nightmare to all of us. Tara went to school on Thursday after a long break from Independence Day week. Most of the time, it isnât serious. Fevers are very common. But this time it got really serious for our Tara."They gave her all the medicines including 'cold dips of water, sponging at night' but nothing helped. Their doctor asked them not to worry as it could be a viral fever that's common these days. However, Mahhi had to rush to the hospital the next day.She revealed, "The doctors ran some tests on her and she was infected with INFLUENZA A FLU. It is a very contagious viral infection of the respiratory system. It causes a high fever, body aches, a cough, and other symptoms. Most children are ill with the flu for less than a week. But some children have a more serious illness and may need to be treated in the hospital. So it was best for us to get her admitted."Mahhi then asked other parents to remain careful and ensure that the child gets 'plenty of bed rest...and lots of fluids." She also advised them to take flu shots. She added, "Avoid sending kids to school even if they have a running nose. This Flu shouldnât be taken lightly and please start taking good care of kids if their immunity is weak. Take care of yourself and the other people in your family. If you havenât already, speak to your doctor about getting the flu vaccine for you and other family members."Mahhi concluded, "Tara is getting better day by day. As today is the 4th day and she is insisting to go home. And hopefully by evening we will be home. No matter how much I try to be strong but whenever it comes to Tara, I always have a breakdown. I donât wish to see any child in this condition. Rab Rakha ð"Earlier this month, Mahhi and Jay celebrated Tara's fourth birthday with their family and friends. Tara, who is already a social media star, dolled up in a unicorn dress and looked lovely. Debina Bonnerjee and Gauahar Khan were some of the celebs who attended the birthday party.

Wednesday, August 23rd 2023 - 08:49 UTC Full article Most of the sea lions found on the beaches were buried in the sand Argentine authorities are investigating whether the death of around 40 sea lions inside the port terminal of Necochea / Quequén was due to an outbreak of avian flu, it was reported Tuesday. A colony of about 400 sea lions is usually to be found there. Experts from the National Service of Agrifood Health and Quality (Senasa) will be carrying out tests in the next few hours to determine the cause of death after Prefectura Naval Argentina (Coast Guard) forces closed the area. Also deployed to the area were specialists from the Marine and Coastal Research Institute of the National University of Mar del Plata and the National Council for Scientific and Technical Research (Conicet). Last week, a sea lion was analyzed in Mar del Plata, due to a series of symptoms noticed by professionals of the local Aquarium compatible with bird flu but the results were negative. On the other hand, the death of at least seven of these mammals was positively linked to this disease in the coastal reserve of the Fuegian city of Río Grande. All dead animals were male with a bleeding nose quite unusual when death is not due to natural causes but rather common in avian influenza, according to marine animal rescuer Carlos Leo quoted by Infobae. “I asked for a necropsy to be performed on the bodies because it could be a case of avian influenza. There was a case of this in a sea lion settlement in Río Negro. And taking into account that in their migratory stage they can arrive in a few days to Necochea, it is possible that if there is an infected one, a contagion could be generated in other colonies,” Leo said. The number of deaths in the last three days was fivefold the number of deaths recorded during the whole of last winter when only eight died. Last month there were also at least 10 deaths of this species. “It is very strange, we have never seen anything like it. It is more than 50 deaths against eight in the same period in 2022,″ the specialist warned. Leo insists an influenza infection can kill within 48 hours. Avian influenza causes the animals to have a pressure problem in their brain that gives them a headache, changes their eye color to red, causes nose bleeds, and makes them tremble. ”It's like this until they are out of breath. I heard about this situation from neighbors who alerted me and when I arrived I saw some of these wolves trembling and with these characteristics. I asked for an investigation. A group of biologists from the University of Mar del Plata and Senasa are working on it,“ he added. Regarding avian flu being transmitted from sea lions to humans, Leo pointed out that ”there are few cases of transmission to people.“ This does not mean that it cannot exist, but the possibilities are low. It may happen that if you are with your dog and it sniffs near the infected animal, maybe it licks the mucus and can bring some contagion,” he went on. Most of the sea lions found on the beaches were buried in the sand to prevent the gases released during decomposition from remaining in the air and becoming a risk.

Korea Times photo by Baek Byung-yeulBy Baek Byung-yeulANDONG ― SK bioscience's L HOUSE plant in Andong, 270 kilometers southeast of Seoul, played a key role in protecting lives during the pandemic by producing COVID-19 vaccines. The Korean vaccine maker said Tuesday that sales of its SKYCellflu influenza vaccine began in Korea, Wednesday.SK bioscience launched SKYCellflu in 2016. The vaccine is the country's first quadrivalent cell culture-based influenza vaccine. A quadrivalent vaccine is designed to protect against four different flu viruses. The company developed the vaccine as health authorities around the world are increasingly recommending the use of quadrivalent vaccines, which are more resistant to mutations than traditional trivalent vaccines, due to the increasing number of strains of the flu virus.The company said the SKYCellflu vaccine is more advanced than traditional vaccines produced through the egg adaptation method and is safer for patients with egg anaphylaxis or egg allergies and requires shorter production time than egg-adaptation vaccines, which enables quicker responses to the emergence of flu viruses.The company suspended production of the SKYCellflu vaccine during the COVID-19 pandemic to focus on manufacturing the COVID-19 vaccine. But SKYCellflu production resumed recently in preparation for the upcoming winter season."Deliveries began on Wednesday and we will provide about 5 million doses of the vaccine to hospitals in Korea between the end of this year and early next year," Lee Sang-gyun, head of L HOUSE plant, told reporters. "About half of the production will be purchased by national agencies through the national immunization program (NIP), while the other half will be distributed through the private market."Seen is SK bioscience's L HOUSE vaccine manufacturing facility in Andong, North Gyeongsang Province, Tuesday. Korea Times photo by Baek Byung-yeulSK bioscience showed the production line of SKYCellflu to reporters visiting the factory and emphasized that its vaccine product has an advantage of being safer than other flu vaccines."Unlike the egg-adaptation method, the cell-based flu vaccine is produced in sterile incubators, so no antibiotics or preservatives are required, which reduces the risk of hypersensitivity reaction to the vaccine," the company said.It added that its vaccine products are also more stable in terms of effectiveness, saying cell-based flu vaccines are less likely to mutate.Based on these strengths, SKYCellflu has the largest market share in Korea. The product was also approved in 10 countries, including Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore and Mongolia, and is currently in the process of being licensed in 10 more countries, expanding its global presence, SK bioscience said.SK bioscience said the flu vaccine market is growing globally and it expects SKYCellflu to stand out not only in the domestic market but also overseas. According to 2021 data from U.S.-based market research firm Allied market Research, the global influenza vaccine market size is expected to grow to $101.27 million in 2030, from $60 million in 2020."This return to the vaccine market will ensure that our people have a wide range of vaccine options, and we will continue to demonstrate the competitiveness of our vaccines as we expand our global reach," the head of the plant said. baekby@koreatimes.co.kr More articles by this reporter Most Read in Business 1Korean food makers ramp up global expansion2Korean battery industry views Trump win as blessing in disguise 3Hyundai subsidiary's robot dog deployed to strengthen security at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate: report 4SK chief wins chance to challenge $986 mil. divorce settlement 5Display panel material maker files complaint against China's TCL for QD panel claim Top 10 Stories 1Yoon practices golf in case of possible round with Trump2Seoul City to test UAM service next year for 2030 commercialization 3Korean food makers ramp up global expansion4Police officer acquitted after alleged prostitution involvement during college years 5N.

Coronavirus What to know about Ohio ‘tripledemic’ warning Posted: Aug 22, 2023 / 12:47 PM EDT Updated: Aug 22, 2023 / 12:48 PM EDT Posted: Aug 22, 2023 / 12:47 PM EDT Updated: Aug 22, 2023 / 12:48 PM EDT SHARE This is an archived article and the information in the article may be outdated. Please look at the time stamp on the story to see when it was last updated. CLEVELAND (WJW) – The Ohio Department of Health is warning about a possible “tripledemic,” a potentially life threatening combination of viruses including the flu, RSV and COVID-19 this fall and winter. In a virtual press conference Thursday, August 17, the department’s director Dr. Bruce Vanderhoff, along with others, advised the public to prevent the preventable by staying up-to-date on vaccinations. 1 child dead after school bus crash in Clark County, multiple injured The word of caution comes amid a “modest rise” of COVID cases nationwide and in Ohio, Dr. Vanderhoff said this summer. “COVID, it isn’t gone, and we really do need to prepare ourselves for the upcoming fall and winter respiratory season,” said Vanderhoff. “Which will undoubtedly include COVID, influenza and RSV.” The department reported just under 3,000 COVID cases last week, 87% fewer cases than this time last year, according to Vanderhoff. He said cases, despite the recent uptick, remain historically low. For the first time, there will be a new tool to fight RSV, vaccinations, for the respiratory virus that left infants gasping for air last year as cases soared nationwide and pushed some pediatric hospitals to capacity. “I have seen the worst versions of RSV where it’s either life-changing, life-threatening or even resulted in loss of life,” said Dr. Michael Forbes, chief academic officer at Akron Children’s Hospital. “So this is actually a historic moment for us in pediatrics.” Strongsville teen sentenced to 15 years to life in prison for double-fatal crash Vanderhoff said the shot could be available as soon as October. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends one dose for infants younger than eight months born during or entering their first RSV season. “Reduces [chances of RSV] by about 70% overall, it reduces hospitalization by almost 75%, so a real game changer,” said Forbes.

Pic/Instagram Mahhi Vij and Jay Bhanushali's four years old daughter Tara Bhanushali recently recovered from Influenza A. The actress penned a long emotional note on Instagram. Mahhi revealed Tara developed a high fever during Independence Day week. Her fever went up to 104 degrees. After consulting a doctor, Tara was rushed to a hospital to receive proper medical attention. ADVERTISEMENTSharing the ordeal, Mahhi wrote on Instagram, "Fevers worry parents, they scare them sometimes. I understand why, because when Tara got high fever on this Thursday night, it was like a nightmare to all of us. Tara went to school on Thursday after a long break from Independence Day week. Most of the time, it isn’t serious. Fevers are very common. But this time it got really serious for our Tara." View this post on Instagram A post shared by Mahhi Vinod Vij (@mahhivij) She further added, "We tried giving her medicines after discussing it with the doctors, but even after giving her IBUGESIC PLUS, her fever continued to be 104 and above. It became really stressful for us. We gave her cold dips of water, sponging at night, still she was shivering and the temperature was getting worse. I spoke to her doctor at 1 in the midnight and he said there’s nothing to worry as all the kids are catching up with viral these days and they are falling sick. But as a mother, I had to worry, so it was a sleepless night for us. Friday morning, I had to immediately rush to the hospital on a Saturday afternoon and the doctors ran some tests on her and she was infected with INFLUENZA A FLU. It is a very contagious viral infection of the respiratory system. It causes a high fever, body aches, a cough, and other symptoms. Most children are ill with the flu for less than a week. But some children have a more serious illness and may need to be treated in the hospital. So it was best for us to get her admitted."The doting mother ended her note saying, "Please ensure your child has plenty of bed rest, encourage them to drink lots of fluids. Don’t forget to take your flu shots, especially the elders. Avoid sending kids to school even if they have a running nose. This Flu shouldn’t be taken lightly and please start taking good care of kids if their immunity is weak. Take care of yourself and the other people in your family. If you haven’t already, speak to your doctor about getting the flu vaccine for you and other family members." Tara is reportedly home now and is recovering under her parental care. "Exciting news!
