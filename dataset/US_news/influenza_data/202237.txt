One of the major drivers of this seasonal variation is thought to be the antigenic drift of influenza viruses, resulting from the accumulation of mutations in viral surface proteins. In this study, we aimed to investigate the association between the genetic drift of seasonal influenza viruses (A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and B) and the epidemiological severity of seasonal epidemics within a Canadian context. We obtained hemagglutinin protein sequences collected in Canada between the 2006/2007 and 2019/2020 flu seasons from GISAID and calculated Hamming distances in a sequence-based approach to estimating inter-seasonal antigenic differences. We also gathered epidemiological data on cases, hospitalizations and deaths from national surveillance systems and other official sources, as well as vaccine effectiveness estimates to address potential effect modification. These aggregate measures of disease severity were integrated into a single seasonal severity index. We performed linear regressions of our severity index with respect to the inter-seasonal antigenic distances, controlling for vaccine effectiveness. We did not find any evidence of a statistical relationship between antigenic distance and seasonal influenza severity in Canada. Future studies may need to account for additional factors, such as co-circulation of other respiratory pathogens, population imprinting, cohort effects and environmental parameters, which may drive seasonal influenza severity.

In Canada, it has been estimated that approximately 12,200 hospitalizations1 and 3500 deaths2 are attributed to seasonal influenza epidemics on average each year. Epidemic severity varies from season to season. Although epidemic influenza dynamics are complex and not well-understood, one of the major drivers of this seasonal variation is posited to be the antigenic drift of influenza viruses3, resulting from the accumulation of mutations from one season to another. In particular, mutations in the hemagglutinin protein, which contains antigenic sites targeted by neutralizing antibodies, can lead to immune escape and may also have implications for vaccine effectiveness4,5. Traditionally, antigenic differences between viruses have been determined experimentally using laboratory procedures such as the hemagglutination inhibition assay; however, these methods are time-consuming and costly. More recently, methods based on changes to genetic sequences have been explored as an alternative approach to antigenic cartography6,7,8. Thanks to the sequencing efforts shared publicly by many participating laboratories worldwide, it is possible to infer the antigenic drift of circulating influenza viruses across many seasons using these computational methods. Previous studies have integrated sequence-based antigenic distances and epidemiological measures of severity obtained through surveillance data to link antigenic drift to seasonal severity9,10. However, to our knowledge, no studies have measured this association within a Canadian context. In this study, we aim to assess if a statistical relationship can be detected between the antigenic drift of seasonal influenza and the epidemiological severity of seasonal epidemics. We limit our analysis to Canada.MethodsGenetic dataProtein sequence data for the HA segment of all circulating A/H1N1 (seasonal and 2009 pandemic), A/H3N2, and B strains collected from human hosts between 2006-08-01 and 2020-08-01 were downloaded from GISAID. We did not restrict the sequence to the predominant strain(s) during this initial data collection because we aimed to be as exhaustive as possible, in case some circulating strains sequenced were not identified as antigenically relevant. The following metadata were extracted from the FASTA header of each sequence: strain name, collection date, location (obtained from the strain name), and GISAID accession number. Only viruses collected in Canada were included for analysis (see table in supplementary file S1 for the complete list of sequence accession numbers).Sequence clean-up was performed. We excluded HA sequences that: did not start with methionine (“M”); did not end with “CI”; had a length different from 565–566 amino acids (type A) or 582–587 amino acids (type B); contained more than 0.5% of aberrant amino acids. The list of sequences was deduplicated based on the strain name8. After cleaning, there were 432 H1N1, 879 H3N2 and 450 B sequences in total. Figure 1 illustrates this filtering process. The MUSCLE program11 was used for sequence alignment using the parameterization “-maxiters 1—diags—sv—distance1 kbits20_3”.Figure 1Flowchart for the cleaning process of the genetic sequences for influenza A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and B. The number of sequences at the top represents the total number of sequences downloaded from GISAID, filtering the virus type or subtype only. The number at the bottom represents the final number of sequences used in this analysis.Full size imageSince Canada’s flu season is in line with temperate zone Northern hemisphere influenza seasonality (generally starting in the fall of one calendar year and ending in the spring of the following calendar year), sequences were divided by season based on their sample collection date. Samples that were collected prior to week 35 of the calendar year were considered to be from the flu season starting in the previous calendar year. For example, a sequence collected on Feb. 1, 2015 would count as part of the circulating strains from the 2014/2015 flu season.Epitope determination and antigenic distance calculationWe performed a literature review to identify antigenically relevant epitopes of the HA protein for influenza A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and B.Through experimental methods such as monoclonal antibody selection of escape mutants or X-ray crystallography, epitope mapping has led to the establishment of major or “canonical” antigenic sites on the HA protein and other surface proteins, such as neuraminidase. However, many other epitopes have been identified outside of these canonical sites as well12,13. Due to the suggestion that epitopes can have “fuzzy” boundaries14 and may also change over time as the virus-host relationship evolves15, we considered multiple epitope formulations in our analysis.Hence, we defined the sequence-based antigenic distance between two aligned sequences as the Hamming distance between their respective HA proteins, considering only the amino acids at the antigenic sites. Moreover, to reflect the uncertainty about the actual epitope positions, we created four definitions of the antigenic distance: (1) a “narrow” definition, comprising only canonical antigenic sites—Sa, Sb, Ca1, Ca2 and Cb for H1N1; A, B, C, D and E for H3N216; and the 120 loop, 150 loop, 160 loop, 190 helix, and 230 region for B17,18,19; (2) a “broad” definition, including a buffer of three amino acids before and after each canonical antigenic site; (3) the full sequence of the HA1 domain, which contains the major antigenic sites; and (4) the full sequence of the HA protein (including both HA1 and HA2 domains). As the results from the HA1 and HA1 + HA2 sequences were similar in preliminary analyses, we only considered the full HA protein sequence containing both HA1 and HA2 (referred to as “full”) moving forward. Furthermore, to test the robustness of these baseline assumptions, we also defined alternative epitope positions to run our analysis. The full list of residue positions is given in Supplementary file S2. We calculated the inter-season antigenic distance independently for A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and B by taking the mean of pairwise distances between all sequences of a season and its preceding season.Epidemiologic dataTo quantify the severity of a seasonal epidemic for a given influenza virus subtype, we constructed a “severity index” (defined below), composed of multiple metrics from various epidemiological data sources.Laboratory-confirmed influenza case numbers from the 2007/2008 to 2019/2020 seasons were obtained from the Respiratory Virus Detection Surveillance System at the Public Health Agency of Canada, which collects data on the number of influenza tests and positive detections across Canada and releases weekly reports 20. Using this data, positivity rates and seasonal peak positivity were determined.Influenza and pneumonia-associated deaths in Canada were obtained from a dataset on leading causes of death from 2000 to 2020 derived from Canadian Vital Statistics death data21. Death counts were normalized by the population of Canada of the corresponding year22. The death rate of year Y was associated with the (Y − 1)/Y seasonal epidemic (i.e., deaths recorded in 2012 were associated with the 2011/2012 season). Pediatric hospitalization data was available to FluWatch, Canada’s national influenza surveillance program, through the IMPACT pediatric hospital-based surveillance network23. The data consisted of a line list with hospitalization date and patient age. The counts were normalized by the population of the 5 year age group corresponding to the patient’s age and the associated flu season was assigned based on the hospitalization date being before or after week 35.The basic reproduction number (R0) was calculated at the start of each season using the approximation outlined by Park et al.24 on the number of laboratory-confirmed cases. The slope of the log-transformed incidence curve was calculated using data points from 10 to 3 weeks before the seasonal peak and taken as the rate of spread for each season. Based on the literature, we set the mean generation interval to 3.6 days and its standard deviation to 1.6 days25.The parameter R0 was calculated only for the seasons where influenza types and subtypes were circulating with substantial prevalence. For H1N1, these were the 2013/2014, 2015/2016, 2018/2019, 2019/2020 seasons; for H3N2, only the 2010/2011 to 2012/2013, 2014/2015, and 2016/2017 to 2018/2019 seasons were included; for B, all seasons except for 2009/2010.The time series of reported influenza cases in Canada are shown in Supplementary file S3.Immunization dataInfluenza vaccine coverage data was obtained from two sources: the Seasonal Influenza Vaccination Coverage Survey (SIVC) and the annual component of the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS). SIVC data was available for adults aged 18 years and older, as well as stratified by age group and chronic medical condition, from 2015/2016 to 2020/2021. Population-wide and age-specific CCHS data was available for individuals aged 12 years and older from 2015 to 2020. Since the outcome measured was “Influenza immunization in the past 12 months,” this corresponded approximately to the 2014/2015 to 2019/2020 flu seasons. Vaccine effectiveness estimates by influenza type and subtype were available from the Canadian Sentinel Practitioner Surveillance Network for the 2004/2005 to 2019/2020 seasons26. After retrieving the data, we observed that vaccine coverage data was missing for several seasons during the study period and did not vary greatly in the seasons we had data for. Hence, we assumed vaccine coverage to be constant and excluded it from the statistical analysis.Severity indexThe severity of seasonal influenza epidemics is multi-faceted. Large numbers of symptomatic cases can have a significant societal and economic impact, with an estimated average cost of $14,000 per hospitalization27 and approximately 14 work hours lost per employee per seasonal influenza infection28. Influenza-associated hospitalizations can stress health care systems, especially during times of peak flu activity, reducing the overall quality of care (e.g., cancelled elective surgeries, staffing changes, etc.)29. High transmission rates also contribute to severity as cases seek care in a short period of time, placing further burden on health systems. In examining the severity of an influenza season, many studies consider one metric at a time (e.g., case fatality ratio30, peak excess pneumonia and influenza-associated mortality rates31, etc.). Others have developed indices that utilize measures along a single dimension32 or that provide qualitative, but not quantitative, assessments of seasonal severity33,34. Based on previous work done to integrate multiple measures into a composite indicator of severity35, we constructed a “severity index” to quantify the severity of a given influenza season independently for influenza A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and B. For a given season, we defined \(p\), the peak positivity calculated from reported influenza cases whose (sub)type has been laboratory-confirmed; \(h\), the number of hospitalizations associated with influenza; \(d\), the number of deaths per 100,000 associated with influenza and pneumonia; \({R}_{0}\), the basic reproduction number (estimated as described above). Then, we defined the severity index \(S\) as:$$S = (P + H + D + R),$$ where \(P = \left( {{\text{logit}}\left( p \right) - m_{p} } \right)/\sigma_{p}\), \(H = \left( {\log \left( h \right) - m_{h} } \right)/\sigma_{h}\), \(D = \left( {\log \left( d \right) - m_{d} } \right)/\sigma_{d}\) and \(R = \left( {R_{0} - m_{{R_{0} }} } \right)/\sigma_{{R_{0} }}\). The parameter \(m_{x}\) is the mean of log(x) (or logit(x) when x represents the peak positivity) across all seasons available from our dataset, and \(\sigma_{x}\) its standard deviation. The parameter \(n\) is the number of variables (among \(P,H,D,R\)) available for a given season (\(1 \le n \le 4)\). Supplementary file S4 is a table detailing the values of the components that constitute the severity index.Statistical analysisTo assess the relationship between the severity index and the inter-seasonal antigenic distance, we performed the following linear regression:$$S \sim \beta_{1} *a + \beta_{2} *v + \beta_{3} *a*v$$where \(S\) is the severity index, \(a\) is the mean inter-season antigenic distance, and \(v\) is the vaccine effectiveness, for a given influenza virus (i.e., A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and B) and season.We imposed a data quality constraint on the regression, that is, the regression was performed only on data points that had a mean inter-season antigenic distance calculated with at least 20 paired sequences and a severity index calculated with not more than one variable missing (n > = 3). This was applied irrespective of the sequence-based antigenic distance definition used (i.e., “narrow”, “broad” or “full”). In addition, seasons with missing vaccine effectiveness estimates were excluded from the analysis.To account for the uncertainty of the sequence-based antigenic distance, we repeated the linear regression using the following Monte Carlo algorithm. The inter-season antigenic distance was assumed to be normally distributed with mean and standard deviation parameters informed by their empirical values. We chose to use a normal distribution instead of the empirical distribution (bootstrap method) to avoid biases induced by small sample sizes. Then, a distance value was sampled from this normal distribution for each season. Finally, the regression was run on those sampled points and the regression coefficients as well as their associated p-values were recorded. This procedure was repeated 100 times. The inference about the relationship between severity and antigenic distance was assessed by considering the distribution of the coefficients and p-values recorded across the 100 iterations.All analyses were conducted using R version 4.1. The code used to conduct the full analysis is available at https://github.com/phac-nml-phrsd/publication-2022-flu-driftResultsThe data points for influenza A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and B are shown in Fig. 2. The data quality constraints gave a total of seven data points (i.e., seasons) for A/H1N1, eight for A/H3N2 and seven for B.Figure 2Relationship between the epidemiological severity (as measured by the Severity Index) and the genetic drift of influenza (as measured by the mean Hamming distance between a season and the previous one). Each row represents a type/subtype and each column a different definition of the antigenic distance. The label next to each point indicates the starting year of the epidemic season (e.g., 2014 for the 2014/2015 season). The size of the point is proportional to the vaccine effectiveness observed that year for a given type/subtype.Full size imageThe outputs from the linear regressions show that we were not able to detect any statistically significant relationship between the epidemiological severity and the inter-season antigenic distance for any of the three viruses considered in our study. The distributions of the regression coefficients are shown in Fig. 3 and their values presented in Supplementary file S5. The top row shows that estimates of mean values for the slope coefficients are close to zero. The bottom row of Fig. 3 shows the distribution of the associated p-values, which all indicate a lack of statistical significance. Similar results were observed across the different antigenic distance definitions used.Figure 3Regression results. The top panels represent the estimated values of the regression coefficients and the bottom panels their corresponding p-values. In all panels, the circle represents the mean estimate, the light and dark vertical bars 95% and 50% quantiles across 100 Monte Carlo iterations. “Dist” represents the covariate for the mean inter-season antigenic distance; “Vax” the covariate for the vaccine effectiveness; “Dist:Vax” the interaction coefficient.Full size imageTo assess the robustness of these results, we performed the same analysis after calculating the antigenic distance with a lag of two seasons instead of one (i.e., determining mean pairwise distances between a given season and the season two years prior). We also simplified the severity index, using alternatively only the peak positivity rate, pediatric hospitalization rate, mortality rate, or the estimate of the basic reproduction number. We obtained similar results in each case (Supplementary files S6 and S7). Moreover, results from sensitivity analyses using alternatively-defined epitope positions (Supplementary file S2) were analogous to the regression results using the baseline definitions (Supplementary file S8).DiscussionThere are probably many factors affecting the severity of an influenza season, including viral genetic drift, the immune history of the population, the prevalence of other seasonal respiratory pathogens, climatic factors, and the effectiveness and coverage of influenza vaccines. Influenza seasons are usually made of “sub-epidemics” from three influenza lineages (A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and B), making attempts to better understand seasonal influenza epidemics even more challenging. This seasonal influenza system, affected by factors interacting in complex ways, has persistently evaded our understanding of its epidemiological impact on populations.The ecological analysis presented here attempted to tackle seasonal influenza in a simplified approach to identify potential main effects of antigenic distance on epidemic severity. Our hypothesis was that the severity of a given seasonal influenza season is driven by the antigenic drift of circulating influenza viruses and the effectiveness of seasonally updated influenza vaccines. To further limit the complexity, we focused on a single geographical location, Canada, which has an established national influenza surveillance system.Even a simplified approach has intrinsic limitations, starting with the observation metrics of seasonal epidemics of influenza. First, it is still not clear how to define the genetic drift of influenza viruses. Antigenic sites, regions on the viral genome prone to mutations that impact immune response, have been broadly identified since the 1980s36,37. However, a precise mapping of the potential impact of influenza virus epitopes is still missing and may never be fully established, given that these epitopes are defined by their interactions with a constantly evolving and heterogeneous human immune system. Viral mutations not only influence the immune response, but also the patient-level severity of the disease. In fact, even single amino acid mutations in the HA protein can have an outsized effect on antibody recognition38, and one mutation in particular has been associated with an increased risk of severe or fatal disease in influenza A H1N1pdm09 infections39. Genetic drift in the NA surface protein, as well as in the internal genes, is also known to play a role in virulence.In addition to the difficulties of nano-scale metrics for genetic mutations, observing macro-scale metrics that translate the epidemiological severity of an influenza season in a population is challenging. Only severe influenza cases are usually identified with a (gold-standard) molecular test, biasing observations. Influenza-associated hospitalizations probe a small segment of the population but may be more representative of severity if records in health systems can identify influenza-related illness as the cause for hospitalization. Influenza-associated mortality is also usually difficult to assess because recording of the actual cause of death may not always be accurate. Furthermore, linkage to the viral type and subtype, or even viral testing—essential when performing an epidemiological analysis—is often lacking for hospitalization and mortality data.Volume and consistency of historical data is also a challenge. Despite having circulated in human populations for centuries (with microbiological evidence of influenza infection dating back to at least 191840) and likely for millennia (with influenza-like illness (ILI) reported as far back as ancient Greece and the first ILI epidemic recorded in 117341), data collection related to influenza infections may not be consistent in time and space within a jurisdiction. The longest time-series available, spanning multiple decades, are often those of ILIs42,43 as sequencing has only become more affordable in the last decade or so44. Unfortunately, ILI data are not specific enough to study seasonal influenza because they include all influenza subtypes and lineages, as well as other seasonal respiratory pathogens that can also have a significant prevalence45. Hence, even jurisdictions with a strong surveillance system may not have more than 20 years’ worth of genetically characterized data on seasonal influenza. Moreover, considering that the current three main influenza (sub)types (A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and B) do not circulate every season, we can expect to have about 10 seasons with a sufficient sample size for an insightful statistical analysis.All the challenges described above apply to our study. Our definitions of epitopes were simply based on previous studies and did not consider specific qualitative properties of genetic mutations. The volume of genetic data sourced from GISAID (after restricting the data set to Canadian sequences) and the volume of epidemiological data were limited to a few hundred sequences and to no more than eight seasons for each of the main seasonal influenza virus types and subtypes, hampering our statistical analysis of the relationship between epidemiological severity and genetic drift.Unlike previous studies9,10, our statistical analysis could not identify an effect of either the genetic drift of seasonal influenza or vaccine effectiveness on the observed epidemiological severity of seasonal influenza epidemics in Canada. This “negative result” could be explained by an actual lack of, or a very small, combined effect of the genetic drift and vaccine effectiveness on the severity of seasonal influenza epidemics. In that case, other factors, like the effect of co-circulation of other respiratory pathogens, may have more importance in explaining the epidemiological severity of seasonal influenzas. Another explanation could be that our methodological approach was not correctly designed. Indeed, our study has several limitations.We observed that the mean inter-seasonal antigenic drift tended to be higher in influenza B compared to influenza A viruses. This is due to pairwise comparison between sequences of the B/Victoria and B/Yamagata lineages, which are antigenically distinct and co-circulate in the population46. Although the two lineages have diverged genetically, this distinction is not made in the epidemiological data, resulting in larger mean antigenic distances between seasons. Previous studies have shown that HA is more genetically similar across influenza B lineages than between influenza A subtypes47, and provide evidence of cross-lineage protection from vaccines48. However, this does not necessarily contradict our findings. Cross-protective antibodies often (though not always) recognize conserved epitopes49, while our analysis focused on genetic changes in canonical antigenic sites, which are more susceptible to mutation. In other words, our decision to utilize a sequence-based estimate of antigenic distance may explain these seemingly opposing points, and larger antigenic distances between circulating influenza B strains may not necessarily correspond to an increased burden of disease.Our use of genetic data was simplified. All influenza sequences were sourced from GISAID. Although this is one of the main sources of genetic data (Influenza Research Database (IRD) being another one), the uploaded sequences may not be representative of all influenza viruses circulating in Canada. We calculated the inter-season genetic distance using the Hamming distance, giving equal weight to each amino acid change, ignoring mutations that may have an outsized impact on antigenicity. We also considered only the hemagglutinin protein when assessing the genetic distance but ignored the neuraminidase (NA) protein. Recognition of the NA protein also plays a role in immune response to influenza infection50, and antigenic drift in NA is a major driver of B/Yamagata epidemics46.Although we could not establish a significant statistical effect of vaccine effectiveness on the severity index, this does not mean that influenza vaccines are ineffective. In our study, the focal variable was the inter-season genetic distance of influenza viruses. Vaccine effectiveness was introduced in our regression as a potential effect modifier. Many studies have shown the value of vaccination against seasonal influenza in preventing serious outcomes51,52,53,54,55. In addition, any conclusions about the role of vaccine effectiveness on epidemic severity would need to include vaccine coverage, which, even if available, may be misleading given the ecological nature of our analysis. Since we primarily worked with aggregate measures of seasonal influenza severity, we often lacked data on individual vaccination status. Although we assumed vaccine coverage to be constant throughout the study period, there is no way to ascertain the percentage of vaccinated or unvaccinated individuals among the lab-confirmed cases or influenza-associated hospitalizations and deaths reported in a given season. Hence, absence of a significant statistical effect from vaccination in our simplified study cannot be extrapolated to determine the impact of influenza vaccination.There are also limitations on the epidemiological side of our study. We ignored co-infection and co-circulation of other seasonal respiratory pathogens to keep the complexity of this study manageable, but there is some evidence that interaction with other pathogens at the individual and population levels may be relevant to understand the drivers of seasonal influenza severity39,56. As a further simplification, we did not consider environmental factors despite some evidence they may be implicated in influenza dynamics57,58. Furthermore, we ignored age-related heterogeneity in vaccine coverage and effectiveness, as well as in the severity of influenza infections. Vaccine uptake tends to be higher in older individuals, while vaccine effectiveness may vary by age due to immunosenescence and immune imprinting59. Related to this, the distribution of influenza types and subtypes amongst predominant circulating strains in a given flu season may affect population susceptibility in an age-dependent manner. H3N2 infections tend to more severely impact older adults compared to younger age groups60 (with the opposite being true of H1N161), and influenza B may also be detected less frequently in the former than in the latter62. Due to the lack of age-specific data in some of the measures used in our regression model, we were not able to conduct stratified analyses to capture the nuances that might exist as a result of age. Similarly, a lack of genetic detail linked to epidemiological data prevented a finer analysis. For example, two antigenically distinct H3N2 clades (3C.2a and 3C.3a) have been circulating since 201463 and should probably have been treated separately in our analysis; however, the clade is rarely identified in reported cases. There is also no distinction made between B/Victoria and B/Yamagata in the weekly surveillance data. As a result, we were unable to separate antigenically distinct clades or lineages when calculating antigenic distances, thereby limiting the conclusions we can draw about the role of antigenic drift in determining seasonal severity.It may also be possible that there are no clearly observable variables that contribute to the severity of seasonal influenza epidemics. Instead, there may be a myriad of small, practically undetectable effects that add up together and ultimately determine the severity of an influenza season64. This would hamper our ability to project the severity of an upcoming influenza season. More advanced computational and statistical techniques (e.g., machine learning) could be tried, but the issue of data volume should be addressed first.In any case, our understanding of the potential factors that can affect the severity of seasonal influenza epidemics could be vastly improved by enhancing several areas. Our study has highlighted the need for more systematically subtyping and recording influenza infections detected via traditional surveillance, as well as expanding this surveillance to populations other than severe cases in order to have a clearer picture of the relative severity of seasonal influenza epidemics. With more detailed epidemiological data, the mutations of the genome of a given influenza subtype or lineage can be scrutinized through the lens of its epidemiological footprints. This would allow us to gain a better qualitative understanding of specific mutations on immunity and/or virulence. Finally, studies of interactions between influenza viruses and other respiratory pathogens at the patient level could shed light on the importance of co-circulation for transmission dynamics of influenza at the population level. The COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has demonstrated that intense epidemiological surveillance and fundamental research can be productive to understanding the dynamics of various lineages (e.g., their immunogenicity, transmission, virulence) and potentially controlling epidemic trajectories. Although the level of investments needed to perform such surveillance and research for SARS-CoV-2 has already eclipsed that of decades of influenza surveillance, it is probably not sustainable for seasonal influenza. Nonetheless, it suggests that our understanding of the sources of seasonal influenza severity could be increased, given enough resources.ConclusionThis study could not establish that the antigenic drift of common influenza viruses has an effect on the epidemiological severity of seasonal influenza epidemics in Canada. To identify the potential factors driving seasonal influenza severity, future studies may need to focus on variables not considered here and/or accumulate more data.

(Getty Images) A vigorous return of influenza may outpace COVID-19 in driving hospitalizations in Oregon over the fall and winter, according to the latest statewide biweekly forecast from Oregon Health & Science University. The latest forecast continues to show a steady decline in the number of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Oregon. A total of 253 people were hospitalized with COVID-19 as of Sept. 14, with the OHSU forecast projecting the number continuing to decline through the end of October, until picking up again in November as immunity wanes and people increasingly gather indoors. The new forecast raises a more pressing concern about influenza — a virus that has been all but absent for the past two and a half years. Peter Graven, Ph.D. (OHSU) “Your flu vaccine is extremely important this year — and certainly more than it has been in the last two years when we had virtually no flu that was circulating,” said Peter Graven, Ph.D., director of the OHSU Office of Advanced Analytics. “The flu is probably going to be at least as important this year as COVID.” Graven cites relatively high rates of influenza starting early in some areas of the Southern Hemisphere, where influenza typically circulates in their winter months, from April to October. Dawn Nolt, M.D. (OHSU) The public’s willingness to wear masks, limit indoor gatherings and take other public health measures limited the spread of COVID-19 over the past two and a half years, said Dawn Nolt, M.D., M.P.H., professor of pediatrics (infectious diseases) in the OHSU School of Medicine. All of those public health measures also minimized the circulation of flu. However, Nolt said the lack of exposure to influenza over the past two years also means that the immune system lacks practice in fighting off the influenza virus. This, in turn, portends a potentially vigorous flu season when the virus begins circulating this fall and winter. “In normal years, lots of people are exposed to the flu, which provides a natural boost to their immune response,” she said. “We haven’t seen much flu at all in the past three years. That makes it really important to get yourself vaccinated against flu this season.” Flu vaccines are widely available at pharmacies and health care systems across the region. In addition to the availability of the flu vaccine, the new bivalent booster vaccine against COVID-19 arrived in Oregon last week, targeting the BA.4 and BA.5 variants along with the original strain of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19. The current number of COVID-19 cases is far below the 1,178 people hospitalized with COVID-19 during the peak of the delta wave on Sept. 1, 2021. Nolt encourages people to get both the COVID-19 booster and annual flu shot as soon as they’re eligible and the shots are available.

Vaccination is the most effective way to prevent influenza illness and associated complications, including death. Influenza vaccination remains particularly important during the COVID-19 pandemic when transmission of SARS-Co V-2 and other respiratory viruses can be high. Clinicians play a critical role in taking action to immunize children and their family members and caregivers. During this COCA Call, presenters will provide an overview of influenza prevention and treatment recommendations for the 2022–2023 season from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Presenters Fatimah S. Dawood, MD Medical Officer Epidemiologist Influenza Division National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Kristina A.

Image University of Arizona Health Sciences researchers will conduct a phase 4 clinical trial to assess how well two different influenza vaccines protect people from the flu as part of the Randomized Assessment of Influenza Vaccine Efficacy Network (RAIVEN), a research collaboration between the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Westat and multiple sites in the United States. Image Karen Lutrick, PhD, is an assistant research professor in the UArizona College of Medicine – Tucson’s Department of Family and Community Medicine. The study will evaluate the efficacy of two vaccines: the recombinant influenza vaccine and the standard-dose egg-based inactivated influenza vaccine (SD IIV). The recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV) is a Food and Drug Administration-approved alternative option to SD IIV, which has been used in adults for almost a century. “We are excited to conduct a real-world test of the RIV vaccine and see how effective it is in protecting college students and frontline workers from influenza,” said Karen Lutrick, PhD, assistant professor in the UArizona College of Medicine – Tucson’s Department of Family and Community Medicine. “An important goal of the RAIVEN study is to increase the accessibility of this type of research. We are proud to represent Arizona in this national network.” Dr. Lutrick and Ashley Lowe, PhD, MSPH, postdoctoral fellow in the UArizona Health Sciences Asthma and Airway Disease Research Center, are leading the Arizona study site, which is one of six in the United States. Westat is managing the $1 million subcontract with funding provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. People between the ages of 18 and 64 who live in Tucson are eligible to participate in the study, though researchers are specifically seeking to enroll college students and frontline workers. Both populations have frequent face-to-face community contact, placing them at higher risk for contracting the flu. Image Ashley Lowe, PhD, MSPH, is a postdoctoral fellow in the UArizona Health Sciences Asthma and Airway Disease Research Center. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either the SD IIV vaccine or the RIV vaccine. Throughout the winter and spring, they will answer surveys about potential illness and take self-administered influenza tests to evaluate how well the vaccines prevented illness. “If RIV demonstrates improved clinical efficacy as compared with SD IIV, health officials can provide updated vaccine recommendations to clinicians, county and state health departments, and the general public,” Dr. Lowe said. “Drs. Lutrick and Lowe are respected researchers and have the experience and expertise to lead this important CDC study in Arizona,” said Kristen Rundell, MD, professor and chair of the Department of Family and Community Medicine. “Our department values research that has a direct impact on the patients and the community we serve.” To learn more or enroll in the RAIVEN study, visit: https:/aivenstudy.org/uaz The study, “Randomized Participant- and Investigator-Blinded Trial to Compare the Clinical Efficacy of Recombinant Influenza Vaccine to Standard Dose Egg-Based Inactivated Influenza Vaccine among Adults Aged 18-64 Years in the United States,” a.k.a. “The RAIVEN Study,” is funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention under award #75D30121C12393.

COVID-19 has been linked to neurologic complications such as stroke, autoimmune encephalitis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome. While physical brain injury is evident in COVID-19-related neurologic syndromes such as encephalitis and stroke, various reports suggest COVID-19-associated brain injury could occur even in the absence of a concomitant neurologic diagnosis. In addition, the exaggerated inflammatory response during COVID-19 might drive progression to severe disease. Study: Brain injury in COVID-19 is associated with dysregulated innate and adaptive immune responses. Image Credit: sfam_photo / Shutterstock About the study In the present study, researchers investigated host markers of the dysregulated immune response. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive COVID-19 patients admitted to Cambridge University Hospital between March 2020 and March 2021 were included. Additionally, the patient cohort was supplemented with a convenience sample of COVID-19 patients from Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Sweden. Healthy subjects were recruited before the COVID-19 pandemic as controls. Stored clinical and plasma data of influenza patients from a separate trial were used as an additional control cohort. A small positive control group was included as a reference for the magnitude of elevations of brain injury biomarkers. This group comprised patients with acute severe traumatic brain injury. Serum samples were collected from admission and convalescence at up to three-time points – acute (< 14 days), sub-acute (15 to 70 days), and convalescent stages (> 80 days; outpatient). Influenza/COVID-19 patients were divided into three severity groups (mild, moderate, and severe) based on treatment during the acute phase. Mild patients did not require oxygen supplementation, moderate patients required supplemental oxygen, and severe patients needed mechanical ventilation. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), neurofilament light (NfL), and total tau concentrations were measured in the sera from COVID-19 patients or plasma from influenza patients. Autoantibodies were screened using a customized central nervous system protein microarray. Further, serum concentrations of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-10, interferon (IFN)-γ, and IL-6, were quantified using multiplexed particle-based flow cytometry. Findings The researchers obtained 250 samples from 175 COVID-19 patients and control samples from 59 healthy subjects and 45 influenza patients. Seventy COVID-19 patients had mild disease, 72 had moderate disease, and 33 patients had severe disease. The concentrations of GFAP, total tau, and NfL were above the functional lower limit of quantification for most healthy control and COVID-19 patient samples. Notably, serum concentrations of GFAP and NfL increased with COVID-19 severity at acute and sub-acute time points, consistent with the levels observed in subjects with severe traumatic brain injury. No differences were observed in total tau levels between patients and controls. Longitudinal samples were available for 67 patients, which allowed for studying temporal dynamics. The authors noted that NfL and GFAP concentrations declined with time, albeit some patients showed increased NfL concentration between acute and sub-acute periods. Serum GFAP concentrations were not different between patients and controls at convalescent timepoint. Nevertheless, serum NfL concentrations at convalescent timepoint were higher in patients with moderate or severe disease than in controls.

Convalescent levels of serum GFAP and NfL correlated with paired samples collected between 15 and 42 days, whereas total tau concentrations did not correlate. Moreover, GFAP and NfL concentrations in the plasma collected from influenza patients with severe disease were elevated to levels comparable to COVID-19 patients. COVID-19 patients exhibited obvious IgG reactivity to spike and nucleocapsid proteins of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and, notably, to the lung surfactant protein A (SFTPA1). Reactivity to SFTPA1 was higher in sub-acute samples of moderate and severe patients than in mild patients or healthy controls. This autoantibody has not been described in the context of COVID-19. Further, autoantibody profiles of cohorts were compared by determining the number and targets of positive autoantibody hits to specific antigens. COVID-19 patients had higher IgG and IgM autoantibody hits than healthy controls. Anti-myelin-associated glycoprotein (anti-MAG) was the most common IgG autoantibody, followed by anti-SFTPA1 autoantibody detected in 9.6% and 8.8% of COVID-19 samples, respectively. Both autoantibodies were not detected in healthy controls. Increased serum cytokine levels were observed in sub-acute samples, and many convalescent samples had elevated cytokine concentrations above the normal range. Moderate and severe COVID-19 patients had elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines. Next, the team investigated the associations between brain injury biomarkers and inflammatory profiles (cytokine and autoantibody responses). There was a positive correlation between serum NfL and GFAP levels and the number of IgG hits. Nonetheless, total tau concentrations were not associated with IgG hits or cytokine profiles. The number of IgM hits was correlated with serum NfL levels but not with total tau or GFAP concentrations. Of note, the researchers found a correlation between the number of IgM hits and all brain injury biomarkers, particularly total tau levels, at convalescence. Conclusions The present study demonstrated elevated concentrations of brain injury biomarkers in COVID-19 patients, which increased with disease severity during acute infection. These elevations correlated with the presence of autoantibodies and proinflammatory cytokines. In addition, there was evidence of a dysregulated immune response even after four months. Notably, autoantibodies against brain antigens did not predict brain injury any stronger than those against non-brain antigens. This meant that brain injury occurred due to general dysregulated immunity and not because of directly pathogenic autoantibodies. Furthermore, data from influenza patients indicated that brain injury during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection was not unique to COVID-19. Overall, the findings revealed the association of brain injury biomarkers with dysregulated immunity in COVID-19. Journal reference: Needham EJ, Ren AL, Digby RJ, et al.

Ted Shaffrey/AP hide caption toggle caption Ted Shaffrey/AP A pharmacy in New York City offers vaccines for COVID-19 and flu. Some researchers argue that the two diseases may pose similar risks of dying for those infected. Ted Shaffrey/AP Has COVID-19 become no more dangerous than the flu for most people? That's a question that scientists are debating as the country heads into a third pandemic winter. Early in the pandemic, COVID was estimated to be 10 times more lethal than the flu, fueling many people's fears. "We have all been questioning, 'When does COVID look like influenza?''' says Dr. Monica Gandhi, an infectious disease specialist at the University of California, San Francisco. "And, I would say, 'Yes, we are there.'" Gandhi and other researchers argue that most people today have enough immunity — gained from vaccination, infection or both — to protect them against getting seriously ill from COVID. And this is especially so since the omicron variant doesn't appear to make people as sick as earlier strains, Gandhi says. Sponsor Message So unless a more virulent variant emerges, COVID's menace has diminished considerably for most people, which means that they can go about their daily lives, says Gandhi, "in a way that you used to live with endemic seasonal flu." But there's still plenty of differing views on this topic. While the threat from COVID-19 may be approaching the peril the flu poses, skeptics doubt it's hit that point yet. "I'm sorry — I just disagree," says Dr. Anthony Fauci, the White House's medical adviser, and director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. "The severity of one compared to the other is really quite stark. And the potential to kill of one versus the other is really quite stark." Shots - Health News The new COVID booster could be the last you'll need for a year, federal officials say COVID is still killing hundreds of people every day, which means more than 125,000 additional COVID deaths could occur over the next 12 months if deaths continue at that pace, Fauci notes. COVID-19 has already killed more than 1 million Americans and it was the third leading cause of death in 2021. A bad flu season kills about 50,000 people. "COVID is a much more serious public health issue than is influenza," Fauci says, noting this is especially true for older people, the group at the highest risk dying from the disease. Sponsor Message Debating the way deaths are counted The debate over COVID's mortality rate hinges on what counts as a COVID-19 death. Gandhi and other researchers argue that the daily death toll attributed to COVID is exaggerated because many deaths blamed on the disease are actually from other causes. Some of the people who died for other reasons happened to also test positive for the coronavirus. "We are now seeing consistently that more than 70% of our COVID hospitalizations are in that category," says Dr. Shira Doron, an infectious disease specialist at the Tufts Medical Center and a professor at the Tufts University School of Medicine. "If you're counting them all as hospitalizations, and then those people die and you count them all as COVID deaths, you are pretty dramatically overcounting." If deaths were classified more accurately, then the daily death toll would be closer to the toll the flu takes during a typical season, Doron says. If this is true, the odds of a person dying if they get a COVID infection — what's called the case fatality rate — would be about the same as the flu now, which is estimated to be around 0.1%, or perhaps even lower. In a new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published Thursday, researchers attempted to filter out other deaths to analyze mortality rates for people hospitalized "primarily for COVID-19." They find the death rate has dropped significantly in the omicron era, compared to the delta period. But Fauci argues that it's difficult to distinguish between deaths that are caused "because of" COVID and those "with" COVID. The disease has been found to put stress on many systems of the body. "What's the difference with someone who has mild congestive heart failure, goes into the hospital and gets COVID, and then dies from profound congestive heart failure?" he asks. "Is that with COVID or because of COVID? COVID certainly contributed to it." Sponsor Message A second reason many experts estimate that COVID's mortality rate is probably lower than it appears is that many infections aren't being reported now because of home testing. The fatality rate is a ratio — the number of deaths over the number of confirmed cases — so if there are more actual cases, that means that the likelihood of an individual dying is lower. "I believe that we have reached the point where, for an individual, COVID poses less of a risk of hospitalization and death than does influenza," Doron says. Dr. Ashish Jha, the White House COVID-19 response coordinator, agrees, especially because the vaccines and treatments for COVID are better than those for the flu. "If you are up-to-date on your vaccines today, and you avail yourself of the treatments, your chances of dying COVID are vanishingly rare and certainly much lower than your risk of getting into trouble with the flu," Jha told NPR. Risk remains high for the elderly and frail But Jha stresses that omicron is so contagious and is infecting so many people that it overall "on a population level poses a much greater threat to the American population than flu does," and it can still cause a greater number of total deaths. And, mortality rates for any disease vary by age and other demographic factors. Importantly, COVID remains much more lethal for older and medically frail people than younger people. Recent data from the CDC shows that compared to 18- to 29-year-olds, people aged 65 to 74 have 60 times the risk of dying; those aged 75 to 84 have 140 times the risk; and those 85 and older have 330 times greater risk. The danger is especially high for those not vaccinated, boosted and treated properly. And with COVID still spreading widely, they remain vulnerable to exposure from social contact. While younger, otherwise healthy people can sometimes get very sick and even die from COVID, that's gotten rare. Sponsor Message "I think it's really important people have an accurate sense of the reality in order to go about their lives," says Dr. Jake Scott, an infectious disease specialist at Stanford University. "If their risk assessments are being driven by or influenced by these overestimated hospitalization and death rates, I think that's problematic." Waiting to see if the pattern is confirmed Other researchers still argue that COVID remains far riskier than the flu. "However you slice it, there was never an instance where COVID-19 was milder than the flu," says Dr. Ziyad Al-Aly of Washington University in St. Louis, who has done research comparing COVID to the flu. "We've never, ever in the history of the pandemic, in all our studies from the beginning until now, have found that COVID-19 is equally risky to the flu," Al-Aly says. "It's always carried a higher risk." Some experts are waiting for more data that shows a clear trend in reduced mortality rates. "I'll probably feel more comfortable saying something like, 'Oh, COVID is similar to the flu' when we actually see a pattern that resembles that," says Dr. Jeremy Faust, an emergency physician at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston in the division of health policy and public health. "We're sort of just starting to see that, and I haven't really seen that in a sustained way." Many also point out that COVID can increase the risk of experiencing long-term health problems, such as long COVID. "Even people with mild to moderate symptoms from COVID can end up with long COVID," Fauci says. "That doesn't happen with influenza. It's a totally different ball game." But Gandhi also questions that. Much of the estimated risk for long COVID comes from people who got seriously ill at the start of the pandemic, she says. And if you account for that, the risk of long-term health problems may not be greater from COVID than from other viral infections like the flu, she says. Sponsor Message "It was really severe COVID that led to long COVID. And as the disease has become milder, we're seeing lower rates of long COVID," Gandhi says. In fact, some experts even fear that this year's flu season could be more severe than this winter's COVID surge. After very mild or even nonexistent flu seasons during the pandemic, the flu hit Australia hard this year. And what happens in the Southern Hemisphere often predicts what happens in North America. "If we have a serious influenza season, and if the omicron variants continue to cause principally mild disease, this coming winter could be a much worse flu season than COVID," says Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease researcher at Vanderbilt University. influenza COVID deaths COVID mortality rate flu deaths Facebook Flipboard Email Read & Listen Home News Culture Music Podcasts & Shows Connect Newsletters Facebook Instagram Press Public Editor Corrections Contact & Help About NPR Overview Diversity NPR Network Accessibility Ethics Finances Get Involved Support Public Radio Sponsor NPR NPR Careers NPR Shop NPR Events NPR Extra Terms of Use Privacy Your Privacy Choices Text Only Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsorTrial Evaluating Pfizer's Quadrivalent mRNA Influenza Vaccine Begins Menu SECTIONS Home Drug Monographs Browse by brand Browse by generic Browse by therapeutic category Monograph Updates Resource Centers Allergic Disorders Cardiovascular Disease Chronic kidney disease Dermatological Disorders Diagnostic Agents Endocrine Disorders Gastrohepatic Disorders Geriatrics Hematological Disorders Immune Disorders Immunization Infectious Diseases Metabolic Disorders Musculoskeletal Disorders Neurologic Disorders Nutrition Ob/Gyn Oncology Ophthalmic Disorders Oral Health Otic Disorders Pain Management Pediatrics Poisoning & Drug Dependence Psychiatric Disorders Respiratory Disorders Urological Disorders News & Features News Drug News Alternative Medicine Safety Alerts And Recalls Biosimilars and Generics News Drugs In The Pipeline The Weekly Dose Podcast Conference Coverage Guidelines Medical Technology Healthcare Policy Features Clinical Challenge Practice, Policy & Legal Clinical Charts Clinical Tools Medical Calculators ICD-10 Special Collections CME/CE MPR App Haymarket Medical Network Cancer Therapy AdvisorClinical AdvisorClinical Pain AdvisorDermatology AdvisorEndocrinology AdvisorGastroenterology AdvisorHematology AdvisorInfectious Disease AdvisorMedical BagMPRNeurology AdvisorOncology Nurse AdvisorOphthalmology AdvisorOptometry AdvisorPsychiatry AdvisorPulmonology AdvisorRare Disease AdvisorRenal and Urology NewsRheumatology AdvisorSleep Wake AdvisorThe Cardiology AdvisorVaccine Advisor Subscribe Part of the Search for a drug monograph: GO Share this article Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share by Email Print Trial Evaluating Pfizer’s Quadrivalent mRNA Influenza Vaccine Begins Brian Park, PharmD | September 14, 2022 A healthcare worker receives the Covid-19 vaccination. Photographer: Bing Guan/Bloomberg The quadrivalent modRNA influenza vaccine candidate uses mRNA technology, which requires only the genetic sequence of the virus. A phase 3 trial evaluating Pfizer’s quadrivalent modified RNA (modRNA) influenza vaccine candidate has been initiated in the United States. The quadrivalent modRNA influenza vaccine candidate uses mRNA technology, which requires only the genetic sequence of the virus. This allows for rapid manufacturing that may lead to better strain match and improved protection over current influenza vaccines. The trial is evaluating the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of the vaccine candidate in approximately 25,000 healthy US adults. The vaccine candidate will consist of the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended strains for the Northern Hemisphere 2022-2023 cell culture- or recombinant-based influenza vaccines. “For years, there has been a need to better address the burden of influenza, despite the use of existing seasonal flu vaccines,” said Annaliesa Anderson, PhD, Senior Vice President and CSO, Vaccine Research and Development, Pfizer. “Our experience with RNA viruses and mRNA technology has given us an even deeper understanding of the opportunity to potentially provide more efficacious vaccines that could further reduce the yearly rates of the severe outcomes of viral disease like flu, including hospitalization and death.” Reference Pfizer initiates phase 3 study of mRNA-based influenza vaccine.

Photo Bird Guides/Richard Taylor The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the HSE Public Health’s Department are highlighting important safety information about Avian Influenza (Bird Flu). This advice follows confirmation of Avian Influenza A (H5N1) in wild sea birds at a number of locations across the country. Avian Influenza (AI), commonly known as bird flu, is a notifiable animal disease and is a highly contagious viral disease affecting the respiratory, digestive and/or nervous system of many species of birds. It can also pose a threat to people and other animals in certain circumstances, but these types of infections are rare. Properly cooked poultry meat and eggs do not pose any food safety risk. With an increasing number of cases of wild bird infection seen along the coast, all keepers of poultry and captive birds should implement stringent biosecurity measures to mitigate the risk of the disease spreading to poultry and captive birds. Poultry farmers and people who keep game birds or pets should be familiar with the signs of avian influenza, and should closely monitor their birds for signs of disease and report any suspicions to their local Regional Veterinary Office. Members of the public are also encouraged to take the following safety precautions: Do not touch sick or dead wild birds Human cases of this strain of Avian Influenza are very rare. However, individuals should not touch sick or dead birds. Report sightings of sick or dead wild birds People can report any sightings of sick or dead wild birds to the local Regional Veterinary Office or contact the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine at 01 492 8026. Keep pets away from wild birds Consider keeping pets indoors or on leash in areas wild birds frequent. Dr June Fanning, Deputy Chief Veterinary Officer at the Department of Agriculture Food and the Marine, explains the risks: “Avian Influenza is highly infectious to birds. Anyone travelling from an area known or suspected to be affected with avian influenza or where wild birds have been found dead should not come into contact with poultry or captive birds without prior cleaning and disinfection of clothing and footwear. It is vital that poultry owners and keepers of captive birds maintain the highest standards of biosecurity to protect their birds. Strict biosecurity remains the number one preventative measure to introduction of avian influenza into poultry and captive bird flocks. Further information is available on the Department website at www.gov.ie/birdflu.” Dr Keith Ian Quintyne, Consultant in Public Health Medicine, Health Protection, HSE Public Health Area A outlines the human health issues: “In the last few weeks there have been a series of confirmed cases of Bird Flu (Avian Influenza A (H5N1) ) in wild sea birds at a number of locations along the coast, with recent reports in Louth. We are continuing to work with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to monitor the cases “It is really important that we do all we can to protect people following the detection of Avian Influenza in the region. We know that people are understandably concerned for the welfare of wild birds, however it is important that you do not touch potentially infected sick or dead wild birds, and if you find a dead wild bird, follow the guidance. To date, no human cases of infection have been reported in Ireland or the EU. Even though the risk to human health is very low, human cases are reported periodically from China, and the UK has recently identified a single human case of avian influenza. Where human disease has occurred, it has tended to be mild. However, elderly people and vulnerable patients living with immunosuppression could be at greater risk of developing more severe disease.” Current Situation: There have been almost 60 wild birds with Avian Influenza A (H5N1) detected nationally along the coast. It is possible during this time that further migratory of wild birds will be found to have died of Avian Influenza. The risk to public health is however considered to be very low. What should I do if I find a dead wild bird? While there have been large numbers of wild seabirds detected with Avian Influenza A (H5N1) around the coast, it is important to remember that the vast majority of wild bird deaths in Ireland will not be related to Avian Influenza, based on information from surveillance activities. However, you should follow routine precautions to prevent any other risks to your health, by following the advice below about contact with avian species, bird feathers, and bird waste: Do not pick up or touch sick, dying or dead poultry or wild birds, and keep any pets away from them Avoid contact with surfaces contaminated with bird faeces Avoid untreated bird feathers (such as those found in the environment) and other bird waste Maintain good personal hygiene with regular hand washing with soap and use of alcohol-based hand rubs. If you find dead waterfowl (ducks, geese or swans) or other dead wild birds, you should report them to: Department of Agriculture, Food, and the Marine at 01 492 8026.

Both Moderna and Pfizer—makers of the first vaccines to earn U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval using the mRNA technology—are studying whether subbing in the influenza virus’ genetic material in that platform will prove equally fruitful.On Sept. 14, Pfizer announced that the first volunteers had received doses of its mRNA flu shot; the Phase 3 study will involve more than 25,000 adults in the U.S. ages 18 and up who will be randomly assigned to receive either the experimental vaccine or a placebo. In June, Moderna announced its late-stage trial of an mRNA-based influenza vaccine that targets the same flu strains that are expected to circulate this fall and winter. Moderna’s study will involve 6,000 adults in the U.S. and other countries in the southern hemisphere, which experiences its flu season several months before the U.S. Both trials are now at similar stages; neither company has provided a timeline for when they might expect results, and, if those results are positive, when they might submit a request to the FDA for approval. Public health experts are hoping it won’t be long, however. The advantage of the mRNA platform is that it’s flexible and generalizable. Theoretically, scientists only need to switch out the genetic material, or mRNA sequences, from one virus for another. It’s a matter of figuring out which specific genes will activate the immune system the best—and that’s where researchers have decades of experience with influenza that they didn’t have with SARS-CoV-2.Read More: mRNA Technology Gave Us the First COVID-19 Vaccines. It Could Also Upend the Drug IndustryBoth companies are targeting the four flu strains that the World Health Organization (WHO) identified in February as being most likely to circulate during the 2022-2023 flu season in the northern hemisphere. The early studies from both Pfizer and Moderna showed the mRNA flu vaccine was safe, which led to the ongoing late-stage studies that will focus more specifically on demonstrating whether the shots are effective at protecting people from influenza. Current vaccines, which use decades-old technology that involves growing the influenza virus in chicken eggs, have traditionally been moderately effective. When WHO experts accurately predict and match the vaccine strains to the flu strains that end up circulating, the shots protect people from serious illness 40%-60% of the time. In years when the match isn’t as tight, the shot’s effectiveness goes down to about 20%-30%.mRNA vaccines should eliminate this mismatch. Because the technology is more flexible, manufacturers can create shots with new genetic sequences in about three months or so. That means that if a bad mismatch occurs during a flu season, scientists could potentially produce a new batch of mRNA flu vaccines targeting the right genetic sequences during the same season. That, in turn, could reduce the hospitalizations and deaths caused by influenza, which still remain relatively high. The virus causes up to 700,000 hospitalizations and 52,000 deaths in the U.S. each year.While an mRNA flu shot would be a huge advance in vaccine technology, there may be other ways to protect people from respiratory illness with combination shots. In a separate trial, Moderna is also investigating combination vaccines that would immunize people against both SARS-CoV-2 and influenza in a single shot.More Must-Reads from TIMEHow Donald Trump WonThe Best Inventions of 2024Why Sleep Is the Key to Living LongerRobert Zemeckis Just Wants to Move YouHow to Break 8 Toxic Communication HabitsNicola Coughlan Bet on Herself—And WonWhy Vinegar Is So Good for YouMeet TIME's Newest Class of Next Generation LeadersContact us at letters@time.comEdit PostHomeU.S.PoliticsWorldHealthBusinessTechPersonal Finance by TIME StampedShopping by TIME StampedFuture of Work by CharterEntertainmentIdeasScienceHistorySportsMagazineThe TIME VaultTIME For KidsTIMECO2CouponsTIME EdgeVideoMastheadNewslettersSubscribeDigital MagazineGive a GiftShop the TIME StoreCareersModern Slavery StatementPress RoomTIME StudiosU.S. & Canada Customer CareGlobal Help CenterContact the EditorsReprints and PermissionsSite MapMedia KitSupplied Partner ContentAbout Us© 2024 TIME USA, LLC.

Dr. Pedro Piedra, professor of molecular virology and microbiology and of pediatrics at Baylor, tells us what we can expect this flu season. “It surprises me to see flu cases already because we’re just in early September and normally we start to see flu a little bit later,” Piedra said. “I don’t know if this is an early sign about what is in store this flu season, but it is a sign that we need to put vaccines on our horizon.” According to Piedra, we have more diversity in flu vaccines than ever before. All influenza vaccines available in the U.S. this year will be quadrivalent vaccines containing two strains of influenza A (H3N2 and H1N1) and two strains of influenza B (B Victoria and B Yamagata). The live attenuated nasal influenza vaccine, FluMist, is available for healthy adults and children between the ages of 2 and 49. For those 6 months to 65 years of age, there is a variety of inactivated flu shots available through different manufacturers. For individuals over the age of 65, vaccines with higher antigen content or an adjuvant are available, as older adults need a slightly more potent vaccine to protect against influenza. Pregnant women can get the inactivated flu shot at any stage of their pregnancy and are encouraged to get vaccinated to protect themselves as well as their infant during the early months of life. Now is the time for all individuals over 6 months of age without any known risk factors that would be a contraindication against the influenza vaccine to get vaccinated, Piedra said. While in the past experts have recommended getting vaccinated against the flu closer to October or November since the flu season usually peaks in January or February, the influenza season is no longer as predictable as it previously was, which is why experts now encourage vaccination earlier in the fall. There also is an improved vaccine for older adults that results in a more robust immune response that will carry protection for longer, which was previously a concern for vaccinating earlier in that age group. It possible to get the influenza vaccine and the new bivalent COVID booster at the same time. The COVID bivalent booster vaccine can be taken three months after COVID infection or two months after the last booster. There are many questions about why the flu vaccine is an annual vaccine while the COVID vaccine has included more frequent boosters. Piedra said that’s because the influenza virus changes every season, and the vaccine is updated annually to try to most closely match the virus that is expected to circulate that flu season, offering protection against deaths, hospitalizations and emergency room visits. Because we are still learning about COVID-19 and how the virus mutates, there has been a need for boosters to provide continued protection throughout the year. Now that a bivalent omicron-specific booster is available that is closer to what is circulating in the community at this time, experts will observe whether this booster will help provide longer protection and result in annual COVID vaccinations. In addition to vaccination and the use of antiviral agents, Piedra also emphasized the importance of good respiratory etiquette for all and non-pharmaceutical interventions, which includes wearing masks in crowds, keeping distance, washing hands frequently and coughing into your elbow, to protect against influenza for those at higher risk for complications from the virus. He also suggests high-risk individuals contact their physician about having antiviral medication at home during the flu season so they can take it as soon as they experience symptoms, since these medications must be taken within two days of symptom onset.

After all, the flu (or influenza) can cause serious illnesses, including a heart attack, stroke or even death.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. PolicyBut the flu can infect people at any age. For that reason, it’s also very important for kids to get vaccinated in order to protect themselves and everybody else around them from getting this seasonal bug.“I recommend all children ages six months of age and older get a flu shot,” says pediatrician Kimberly Giuliano, MD. “These vaccines are incredibly safe and have been around for many years. They definitely help prevent severe disease and deaths.”Why a flu shot is importantMuch like it does for adults, a flu shot for kids offers protection against serious illness. Kids who get the flu vaccine are less likely to get sick and less likely to need to be hospitalized if they do get the flu.After all, the flu doesn’t care how old you are. Anybody can get very sick, including children. For example, kids under age 2 are one of the groups at an increased risk for bad influenza if they get infected.Dr. Giuliano notes that kids who live with underlying medical conditions are especially at risk of developing more serious disease.“In children living with immunocompromising conditions, the virus can spread more quickly throughout their bodies and give them a more severe case of the flu,” she says. “Children living with heart disease, asthma or other kinds of lung conditions can also have more breathing difficulties and challenges with the illness, as compared to children without.”AdvertisementThe potential for flu shot side effects in kids might make some parents hesitant to have their kids vaccinated. But the main side effects of the children’s flu shot are arm soreness and muscle aches, both of which go away relatively quickly.Flu complications, however, can be much more serious. And there’s often no way of knowing if you’ll have a serious reaction to the flu.“Although complications and more severe cases of the flu are more common in children with underlying medical conditions, we do see kids who are very sick with the flu every year,” says Dr. Giuliano. “That includes children who were otherwise healthy who are admitted to the hospital with severe pneumonia. They often need oxygen, and sometimes even ventilator support.”In recent years, the flu season wasn’t as bad. That’s because the precautions that people used to prevent the spread of COVID-19 — wearing masks, social distancing and staying home when sick — also prevented many other viruses from spreading, including influenza. With most of these precautions being dropped, conditions are right for the flu to spread.Plus, Dr. Giuliano says we can look to trends elsewhere in the world for a clue as to what the U.S. flu season might look like — and the 2022-2023 flu season in other places is looking busy. “What we’re seeing in other parts of the world, most specifically Australia, is that they are having an earlier onset of their flu season, as well as higher rates,” she notes. “If that trend continues, we will likely be seeing that here in the U.S. as well.”When should my child get the flu shot?Experts recommend adults and kids get a flu shot in September or October. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also recommends that kids under age 9 who are getting the flu vaccine for the first time should get a second dose about a month after their first dose.“Typically, we see the flu rates start to diminish by springtime, and so it’s best to get the vaccine before flu starts to circulate,” advises Dr. Giuliano. “You don’t want to be exposed to that first case of the flu if you haven’t received your vaccine yet.Luckily, she adds that the children’s flu vaccine is typically effective for kids for about six to nine months after it’s been given. “Getting vaccinated in September or October will prepare you for the upcoming season,” Dr. Giuliano notes.Is the nasal spray vaccine effective?When it comes to getting a flu shot for your child, you might have heard about the nasal spray vaccine. This option hasn’t been as common in recent years due to production and distribution challenges, although Dr. Giuliano says it should be available “in some limited supplies” this year.Given that your kids might worry about getting a shot, you may wonder if it’s an acceptable alternative. Dr. Giuliano says the nasal spray could be a viable option for kids nervous about needles or an injection. “Perhaps a child afraid of needles could think of this as a potential option.”AdvertisementHowever, she stresses the nasal spray vaccine isn’t appropriate for everybody. Kids living with certain medical conditions, such as immunocompromising conditions or severe asthma, shouldn’t get the nasal vaccine. “That’s because it’s a live virus,” Dr. Giuliano explains. “It could potentially make some of these kids ill. We wouldn’t want them to suffer complications when there’s a completely appropriate and safe injection available to them.”Plus, there’s some question about how effective the nasal spray vaccine is. “Some studies show that the nasal spray is bit more effective,” says Dr. Giuliano. “Some show that it’s a little bit less effective.”The bottom line, she notes, is that it’s important to get some form of the flu vaccine for protection. “The one that’s going to be the most effective for your child is the one that gets into their body,” Dr. Giuliano says. “I wouldn’t worry over which one to pick if you have difficulty getting access to the nasal one. The injectable one is a completely fine option that provides just similar levels of protection for children.”How to prevent yourself from getting sickIn addition to getting a flu shot, kids should make sure they are vaccinated against COVID-19. “We don’t have a vaccine out there for every single virus, but these two we know can be especially problematic,” says Dr. Giuliano. “And so it’s great that we have the vaccination option. Protecting yourself with a vaccine for flu and a vaccine for COVID is definitely going to reduce the risk of your child having serious respiratory illnesses this year.”AdvertisementAs flu season approaches, kids and families should also make sure they’re following good health hygiene. “Make sure you’re washing your hands really well,” stresses Dr. Giuliano. “Teach kids to cough into their arms instead of into their hands or into the air, where they’re more likely to spread the viruses to other folks.”Above all, stay home if you’re not feeling well. “It doesn’t have to be COVID,” Dr. Giuliano says. “If you have a cough, respiratory symptoms or a fever, give yourself that time that you need to rest and recover. You’ll also reduce the spread of any respiratory viruses to other people.”For anyone who’s concerned about the flu shot, Dr. Giuliano recommends reaching out to your child’s doctor and talking with them to get any questions answered.“These vaccines are effective, they save lives and they’re safe,” says Dr. Giuliano. “We don’t die from vaccines — but we do die from infections. We still expect flu to spread from person to person and place to place like it has in the past, and getting the vaccine is the best way to protect yourself and prevent the spread.”AdvertisementLearn more about our editorial process.AdvertisementRelated ArticlesNovember 6, 2024/Men's HealthWhen Do Men Stop Growing?Most males usually stop growing by age 18, but some may continue growing into their 20sNovember 1, 2024/Children's HealthHere’s How Many Hours Teens Should SleepThe need for sleep often takes a back seat for teens, but they need eight to 10 hours of sleep to stay mentally healthy, strengthen their brains and prevent injuryOctober 29, 2024/Children's HealthRSV vs. Pneumonia: Sorting out Your Child’s Fever and CoughRSV can lead your child to develop pneumonia and have trouble breathingOctober 28, 2024/Children's HealthWhen Can Babies Have Juice?No juice until your child is 1 year old — and even then, they shouldn’t have much, if any October 25, 2024/Children's HealthDoes Your Child Have RSV?

By TZVI JOFFRE SEPTEMBER 11, 2022 22:39 A sign warns about the avian influenza in an area of Randers, Denmark November 17, 2020 (photo credit: VIA REUTERS) A dolphin in Florida and a porpoise in Sweden were found to be infected with the H5N1 strand of highly patheogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in the first such cases ever recorded, local researchers confirmed in recent weeks, as the bird flu continues to spread through both birds and mammals across Europe and North America.Researchers from the University of Florida confimed that a bottlenose dolphin found dead in Florida's Dixie County was infected with avian influenza. “While obviously, the presence of HPAIV is a concern, the key takeaway for us is that additional caution should be taken by those handling or encountering wild dolphins during rescue events or while performing necropsies,” said Mike Walsh, D.V.M., a clinical associate professor with UF’s College of Veterinary Medicine. Richard Webby, Ph.D., the director of the World Health Organization Collaborating Center for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals and Birds at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, TN, stated while the virus has "some features that make further study and follow-up on mammalian cases important," it does not currently contain the features needed for transmission between humans and other mammalian hosts.Webby added that the discovery of avian influenza in a porpoise in Sweden "almost certainly suggests" that the infected dolphin in Florida was not a "one-off, unique event."

An autopsy found that the porpoise was infected with H5N1 avian influenza."Unlike seals, where disease outbreaks caused by influenza viruses have been repeatedly demonstrated, there are only isolated reports of influenza viruses in cetaceans (a subcategory of aquatic mammals that includes whales, dolphins and porpoises). It is likely that the porpoise somehow came into contact with infected birds," said Elina Thorsson, game veterinarian at the National Veterinary Institute."Unlike seals, where disease outbreaks caused by influenza viruses have been repeatedly demonstrated, there are only isolated reports of influenza viruses in cetaceans (a subcategory of aquatic mammals that includes whales, dolphins and porpoises). It is likely that the porpoise somehow came into contact with infected birds."Elina Thorsson Avian influenza is infecting mammals at a higher rateAvian influenza has been increasingly infecting mammals in the past year, although experts still estimate that the risk to humans remains low. In the current outbreak, only one person in the US and one person in the UK have been infected with the virus. Both exhibited light symptoms and recovered fully.In July, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) declared an "Unusual Mortality Event" sfter over 150 seals were found sick or dead in Maine, with many confirmed H5N1 infections. Since June, over 250 seals have been found stranded in Maine, as of August 28, according to NOAA.Multiple cases of avian influenza have also been reported in wild foxes, bears, raccoons, skunks and other mammals in the past year.

The authority warned that the persistence of the virus in wild birds may indicate that the flu has become endemic in Europe.The CoBank financial services company reported on Wednesday that the shock to domestic markets in the US has been more severe in the current outbreak compared to the last outbreak in the US in 2014-15, with egg prices nearly tripling and turkey breast prices rising 60%.CoBank projected that prices will take longer to drop this time compared to the last outbreak due to a variety of factors, including high labor and feed costs. Over 43 million domesticated birds in 39 states have been culled or died due to the virus, according to the latest data from the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service of the US Department of Agriculture. Hundreds of cases have been confirmed among wild birds as well.In Canada, over 2.1 million birds have been affected by the outbreak throughout the country, according to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.Health officials are concerned that bird migrations in autumn will bring another spike in cases, with officials around the world, including in Israel, already preparing for multiple possibilities.Sign up for the Health & Wellness newsletter >> Related Tags Sweden dolphin Florida mammals Assuta Health bird flu Hot Opinion Dear Jared Kushner, the Jewish people need you By JPOST EDITORIAL To recover, Democrats must expel anti-Zionist extremists who put off Middle America By AMOTZ ASA-EL Leaders of the Jewish enemies have always died as weak cowards By URI PILICHOWSKI How will the recent US election affect Iran, Russia, and North Korea?

And it seems like there is no shortage of misinformation and misunderstanding. So, let’s dispel some of these misconceptions so we can all have a safe and healthy season. Myth: You can catch influenza from the flu vaccine. False. Modern flu vaccines do not have any flu-like properties in them, so it is impossible to catch the virus from them. It is common to feel ill after getting the vaccine but that doesn’t mean you contracted the flu. It’s just your body responding to the vaccine and creating its natural immunities and that’s good. There are some intranasal preparations of flu vaccine which do contain the live virus; however, all injectable forms of the flu vaccination do not contain a live virus and cannot cause infection. Myth: Getting the flu vaccination is all you need to do to protect yourself from influenza. Although getting the flu vaccine is the most important thing you can do to protect yourself against the flu, there are also other methods you can use in combination with the vaccine to protect yourself and others around you. Use good hand hygiene. Cover your mouth when coughing or sneezing. Wear a face mask. Maintain your hydration. These are all great way to decrease your chances of catching the flu and prevent spreading the flu virus to your family and friends. Myth: The flu is just a bad cold. False. Influenza is fundamentally different from the cold, the symptoms can be similar, but it is more severe for certain people. It’s much more serious than the cold and should be taken much more seriously. COVID-19 vs. flu vs. RSV Myth: You don't need to get a flu shot every year. It's important to get the flu vaccine every year because every year the vaccine is different. Each year professionals develop advancements in the flu vaccine. They use data gathered from previous years and use their research to accurately predict the possible strain of flu that could be prevalent during flu season the following year. With each year and new information available, they enhance the flu vaccine giving you the best chance to protect yourself. Myth: Healthy people don't need to be vaccinated. Although there is a much lower risk of getting a severe reaction from the flu if you are healthy, remember that it’s your job to protect your family, friends, neighbors and people around you. Myth: Vitamin C cures the influenza. There is no evidence to support that consumption of vitamin C will cure the influenza. The best way to protect yourself is to get the vaccines, wash your hands thoroughly and regularly, use hand sanitizer and cover your mouth when you are sneezing. Actively use your face mask. You should also maintain your hydration and contact your health care provider if you start experiencing flu like symptoms or your symptoms get worse.

If we are comparing apples to apples, Hong Kong’s influenza death rate since May is in fact zero.”Hong Kong has recorded 9,836 deaths related to the virus since the first infections were detected in January 2020, the bulk of them during the fifth wave that began in December.

Several studies indicated that changes in indoor humidity could be one of the key factors explaining this.ObjectiveThe purpose of this study is to quantify the association between relevant epidemiological metrics and humidity in both influenza and SARS-CoV-2 epidemic periods.MethodsThe atmospheric dew point temperature serves as a proxy for indoor relative humidity. This study considered the weekly mortality rate in the Netherlands between 1995 and 2019 to determine the correlation between the dew point and the spread of influenza. During influenza epidemic periods in the Netherlands, governmental restrictions were absent; therefore, there is no need to control this confounder. During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, governmental restrictions strongly varied over time. To control this effect, periods with a relatively constant governmental intervention level were selected to analyze the reproduction rate. We also examine SARS-CoV-2 deaths in the nursing home setting, where health policy and social factors were less variable. Viral transmissibility was measured by computing the ratio between the estimated daily number of infectious persons in the Netherlands and the lagged mortality figures in the nursing homes.ResultsFor both influenza and SARS-CoV-2, a significant correlation was found between the dew point temperature and the aforementioned epidemiological metrics. The findings are consistent with the anticipated mechanisms related to droplet evaporation, stability of virus in the indoor environment, and impairment of the natural defenses of the respiratory tract in dry air.SignificanceThis information is helpful to understand the seasonal pattern of respiratory viruses and motivate further study to what extent it is possible to alter the seasonal pattern by actively intervening in the adverse role of low humidity during fall and winter in temperate regions.ImpactA solid understanding and quantification of the role of humidity on the transmission of respiratory viruses is imperative for epidemiological modeling and the installation of non-pharmaceutical interventions. The results of this study indicate that improving the indoor humidity by humidifiers could be a promising technology for reducing the spread of both influenza and SARS-CoV-2 during winter and fall in the temperate zone. The identification of this potential should be seen as a strong motivation to invest in further prospective testing of this non-pharmaceutical intervention.

Recently, ventilation of indoor spaces with fresh outdoor air and air cleaning are also recognized as important NPIs [2,3,4,5]. To identify the potential of other NPIs, it is helpful to study the effect of environmental factors on viral transmission. Several studies [6,7,8] indicated that the specific humidity is such a factor. In contrast to the well-controlled indoor temperature, indoor-specific humidity usually follows the seasonal variations of its outdoor counterpart. Specific humidity values outdoors and indoors are typically much lower in the winter than in summer, which causes indoor relative humidity (RH) values to also be much lower in winter since indoor temperatures are relatively constant year-round. It is technologically feasible to maintain both the indoor temperature and humidity at the desired level. The potential of humidity control as an NPI for influenza has been studied before [7, 9, 10], but for SARS-CoV-2 this NPI has hardly received attention [6]. Looking at the present development of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and possibly a revival of influenza, it is important to explore the potential of additional NPIs to support ongoing and upcoming pharmaceutical interventions.Causal evidence for the role of humidity on the transmission of respiratory viruses is mainly retrieved from laboratory experiments with various model animals: mice [11], guinea pigs [12], and ferrets [13] considering both animal-adapted viruses and human pathogenic viruses. Also, the transmission metrics differ per study: number of fatalities, presence of pulmonary lesions, frequency of seroconversion, and viral titer in nasal wash of exposed hosts. These differences in study design disallow a direct comparison between study results, but the general observation is that an RH in the range between 40 and 60%, at a (room) temperature of 20–23 °C, seems to reduce the transmission of the respiratory viruses considered. Several mechanisms have been identified that could explain the dependency on viral transmission of respiratory viruses on humidity and temperature [8, 14]. Firstly, the RH and temperature control the evaporation rate of droplets. Smaller droplets have a significantly lower terminal settling velocity and are also more susceptible to dispersion by indoor-air flows [15,16,17,18]. Hence, the residence time of respiratory droplets of infected hosts is prolonged in dry air. Secondly, the RH affects the stability of enveloped viruses in both air and on surfaces [19,20,21]. The latter could affect the possibility of the fomite infection route, although a recent systematic review study concludes this route is likely negligible in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 [22]. A remaining plausible infection route from fomites is via “aerosolized fomites” [23], where active virions are resuspended from surfaces and inhaled by recipients [24]. The dependence of viral stability as a function of humidity is a complex relation. Several studies indicated that there is an optimal range in terms of RH at a fixed temperature that minimizes the viral survival time [21]. Thirdly, the effectiveness of the natural defenses of the respiratory tract depends on humidity. In particular, the clearance of the airways by mucociliary transport, the indispensable first line of defense of the human body, is hindered by inhaling dry air [25, 26]. This is attributed to a decreasing depth of the periciliary fluid layer, which squeezes the cilia, and increasing viscoelasticity of the mucuos layer on top of the epithelium cells that line the inner surfaces of the respiratory tract. It is also found that dry air can impair innate antiviral defense and tissue repair of the airways [27].For ventilation purposes, indoor and outdoor air needs to be exchanged at a sufficient rate [28]. During this exchange the water vapor mass is conserved, such that the specific humidity (i.e., gram water vapor per kg air) between the indoor and outdoor environment is practically the same. In winter, however, indoor air is heated to room temperature. This means that the capacity of indoor air to hold water increases. The RH can be seen as the ratio between the actual water content of the air compared to its maximum holding capacity. Thus, as a consequence of heating, the indoor RH drops with respect to the outdoor RH, which is typically much larger than 40% for a country like the Netherlands (annual mean 80%, std 15%). While the intended warming effect is indeed physiologically beneficial, the drying effect is not. For quantitative analysis, it is fortunate that the indoor temperature is usually kept at a more or less constant level, so that the outdoor specific humidity becomes a reliable indicator for the physiologically important indoor RH. Humidification technology can be employed during cold periods in temperate regions to compensate the deficit of indoor water vapor. A study found that in the pre-school setting the application of humidity control strongly helps to reduce the transmission of influenza A [10]. More specially, they observed a significant reduction in the total number of influenza A virus-positive samples (air and fomite) and viral genome copies in the rooms with humidification compared to the control rooms. The number of influenza-like illness cases was also reduced by a factor of 2.3. Earlier studies on humidity control, in various settings, already pointed in a similar direction, but the statistical confidence was not fully satisfactory [7]. It should also be noted that the earlier studies were performed in a time when building isolation had less priority, such that natural ventilation rates with fresh outdoor air were presumably higher, thereby compensating, to some extent, the adverse effect of low indoor humidity [7]. A recent systematic review study on the effect of humidity control on dryness symptoms or upper respiratory infections in educational settings and workplaces concluded that, almost four decades later, the quality of the evidence is still too low to be confident of the overall findings of thirteen studies published between 1963 and 2018 [29]. Interventional studies are also supported by model studies, e.g., on the survival of influenza in a residential setting [9]. Controlled-chamber tests with diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infected participants demonstrated that humidification results in a significant reduction of viral load in aerosols and an increased viral load on a surface [30]. The authors [30] concluded that, considering that aerosol-mediated transmission has a substantially higher risk compared to fomite-mediated transmission, humidification is important for building health and safety, next to ventilation and air filtration.The association between meteorological variables and the prevalence of respiratory virus is well studied [31]. The prevalence of influenza is typically associated with a lower outdoor temperature. Since the temperature and dew point temperature strongly correlate, a dependency on outdoor temperature also implies an association with dew point and vice versa (confounders). As the dew point can be converted into a specific humidity via basic thermodynamic relations, this means that if there is an association with the outdoor temperature there is also an association with the specific humidity and thus the indoor RH (see above). A study [31] reported that the mean dew point temperature on days that influenza A and B were detected in their samples was 3.94 and 3.26 °C, respectively. In contrast, in days these viruses were not detected the mean dew point temperature was 6.93 and 6.52 °C. Interestingly, a dew point of 6.0 °C corresponds with an indoor RH of approximately 40%. Thus a similar threshold was observed in the animal experiments. Another study found that the onset of influenza in the United States was signaled by different specific humidity levels per state, and that this value is higher for states that have a higher annual average humidity [32]. The estimated prevalence of influenza in the Netherlands between 2015 and 2019 also shows a strong correlation with the specific humidity [33].For SARS-CoV-2, the statistical confidence of studies that appeared early in the pandemic is limited. However, these studies involve data from many countries and consistently found a declining trend of positive test cases with temperature, absolute humidity, specific humidity, or dew point [34]. A detailed spatial-temporal study toward lagged meteorological impacts on the SARS-CoV-2 incidence figures for longer times and 200 different counties in the United States convincingly showed that both a lower temperature and lower outdoor RH result in a significantly increased risk factor [35]. For the Netherlands, it was observed that the number of hospitalization of SARS-CoV-2 cases in an early stage of the pandemic had a significant negative correlation with the specific humidity [33].The objective of this work is to improve the associative evidence basis for humidity as a potential NPI to reduce the transmission of both influenza and the SARS-CoV-2 viruses in a temperate country like the Netherlands. As both SARS-CoV-2 and influenza are enveloped viruses, it can be expected that the transmission characteristics are comparable. The hypothesis is that indoor RH plays an important role in the transmission of both viruses. As the indoor humidity is controlled by the outdoor specific humidity and equivalently the dew point temperature, a negative correlation is expected between the transmission metrics and the dew point. It should be anticipated that both viruses become endemic and develop seasonality. This could cause an ongoing pressure on the health care system in coming years. For this reason, we combine in this study influenza and SARS-CoV-2 data. A complicating factor to quantify the role of an environmental factor on viral transmission, like humidity, is the time-variation of many socio-economic factors and the installation of governmental interventions. In this study, we control for this effect by selecting periods where interventions are either absent on a national level (two decades with influenza periods) or the level of intervention varies only weakly and by focusing on infections in a specific setting where policy and social factors are less variable. This retrospective study can contribute to assess the potential of humidity control as an NPI for both influenza and SARS-CoV-2 in temperate regions and motivate further prospective studies to this NPI.MethodsInfluenza-associated mortality dataThe National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) [36] and Statistics Netherlands (CBS) [37] produce, in collaboration with other institutes, yearly surveillance of influenza and other respiratory viruses in the Netherlands. These reports include several metrics such as the estimated incidence figures, detailed analysis of specimens from patients, and the overall mortality numbers in the epidemic weeks. The relation between the estimated influenza incidence figures and environmental factors is already studied in detail [33]. Therefore, these data are not included again in our analysis.Via the Dutch municipal system, the presumed cause of death is centrally reported to Statistics Netherlands (CBS). The yearly number of cases where influenza was reported as the primary cause of death is not in-line with the cumulative excess mortality observed during the influenza epidemic weeks. This indicates that influenza likely acts as a hidden health factor or causes displaced mortality in certain risk groups, but is not recognized as a primary cause of death. Therefore, we assume that the total mortality in influenza periods, minus a multi-year averaged baseline mortality, provides a more complete metric to assess the health impact of influenza. Another advantage of using overall mortality data is that for many years, 1995–2021, data per week are available. Compared to the estimated number of influenza cases, the mortality data do not involve a possible test-bias.SARS-CoV-2 reproduction numberThe National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) maintains a detailed database of all COVID-19 data in the Netherlands. From this source, we obtain the reproduction number R(t), which is the most direct metric for the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2. In the early stage of the pandemic, R(t) was estimated by the number of hospitalizations. Since June 12, 2020, R(t) is computed from the daily number of positive tests. In most cases, the day of first symptoms was known. The time between the first day of symptoms of a new case and the first day of symptoms of the person who infected them was approximately 4 days on average. RIVM provides both the estimated R(t) as well as the corresponding 95% confidence interval [36].SARS-CoV-2 number of infectious personsBy combining serological data and hospital admissions RIVM computed the number of infectious persons for each day N(t). The serological survey started with 3200 persons in April 2020 and increased to a total of 7700 participants. Each participant is asked to fill in a questionnaire and send a blood sample to RIVM at regular intervals. These blood samples were tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Based on this information the ratio between hospital admissions and the number of infected persons is determined. The daily reported number of hospital admissions can then be converted into an estimate of the number of infectious persons.SARS-CoV-2 mortality in nursing home careThe number of deceased persons D(t) within the population of nursing homes residents is registered on the day of death. RIVM only incorporates persons above 70 years in the statistics.Meteorological dataMeteorological data are obtained from the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI) [38]. This institute maintains multiple observational stations and maintains a database that contains several decades of data. The specific humidity is not directly available but can be computed from the temperature and the RH or by the dew point. In this study, the dew point Td(t) was selected as the relevant metric for humidity. The regional variations in Td(t) are small in the Netherlands because of the limited elevation differences and modest country size. The distance to the coastline results in some variation. To obtain a representative value for the Netherlands observational data from five stations have been averaged: De Bilt (Central), Eindhoven (South), Rotterdam (West), Hoogeveen (North), and Twente (East). The meteorological data is averaged in a time window of four days in accordance with the computation of R(t) by RIVM.Governmental intervention dataTo quantify the level of governmental intervention we use the Containment & Health index (C&H), which is a parameter within the Oxford Coronavirus Government Response Tracker [39]. This index is a combination of a wide range of indicators such as closures of specific settings, mobility restrictions, economic measures and health indicators related to testing policy, the extent of contact tracing, requirements to wear face coverings, and policies around vaccine rollout. The C&H index does not measure the level that the public complies with an intervention. Also, the effectiveness of each intervention is difficult to assess and the risk of confounding is high, as many interventions are installed simultaneously [1]. Therefore, we apply the C&H index not as an absolute indicator, but in a relative sense to identify rapid interventions (lockdowns), gradual trends with the installation or release of interventions and to find periods where the intervention level is less variable and the impact of environmental factors was presumably stronger.Statistical analysisSince meteorological differences within the Netherlands are relatively small, it is assumed that there is no need to correct for spatial differences and it suffices to apply a temporal analysis of both influenza and SARS-CoV-2 epidemic periods.The weekly excess mortality was computed by subtracting a 10-year moving average from the weekly total mortality figures in the period 1995–2019. The maximum weekly excess mortality per influenza endemic period was retrieved manually. An averaging window was centered around each maximum to obtain the mean curve of the excess mortality during an influenza period in the Netherlands. The level of association and time delay was determined by bivariate analyses between week averaged dew point temperature and the weekly excess mortality figures for different time lags.For SARS-CoV-2, the reproduction number R(t) was compared with the dew point temperature Td(t) averaged over one reproduction period (4 days). It was assumed that in periods with a relatively constant C&H index, environmental factors have a more significant impact on the variability of the reproduction number and thus the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The level of association was quantified via bivariate analyses between R(t) and Td(t).In nursing home care, the policy was consistently focused on maximum protection of susceptible residents and also social-behavioral factors are less variable compared to other settings like schools, recreational and work locations. For this reason, it was assumed that the expression of environmental factors on SARS-CoV-2 transmission is stronger in the nursing home care setting compared to the national metrics. The strategy was to quantify the translation from the estimated number of infectious persons in the Netherlands, N(t), to the number of nursing home deaths per day D(t). A delay time of 12 days was assumed, based on the reproduction time (~4 days) and the median time between the day of first symptoms and the moment of death (~8 days). The association was quantified by a univariate analysis of both N(t–12), D(t), and Td(t–12) over selected periods.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.ResultsInfluenzaFigure 1 shows the number of deceased persons per week from the years 1995 to 2019. The maxima in the winter months can typically be associated with influenza events (depicted by stars). These peaks appeared between week 52 and week 14. The highest maximum corresponds to the influenza event of 2017–2018, which was also accompanied by a high number of hospital admissions at that time. Other maxima outside this period are associated with extreme temperatures in the summer months and are not considered in this work.Fig. 1: Number of deceased persons per week as reported by Statistics Netherlands (CBS).The red line represents a moving average of 10 years around each week. The stars depict mortality maxima in influenza epidemic periods and the corresponding week number is given.Full size imageFigure 2 shows the average signature of the influenza events between 1995 and 2019, as shown in Fig. 1, in terms of the excess mortality rate and the dew point temperature. These curves show a very strong resemblance. The minimum value of the Pearson correlation (pr) is −0.92 for a lag time of 1 week. This implies that the minimum in the dew point appeared before the maximum in the excess mortality. The dew point reference line of 6.0 °C corresponds with a relative indoor humidity of approximately 40% at an indoor temperature of 20 °C. Positive excess mortality starts 1 or 2 weeks later after the dew point has passed this reference line. These observations strongly suggest that the dew point (indoor humidity) affects the transmission of influenza, at least in an associative sense.Fig. 2: Excess mortality per week and the dew point per hour (solid line) and week (dashed).Both variables are averaged over windows centered around the maximum mortality in the influenza epidemic periods in the years 1995–2019 depicted by the star symbol in Fig. 1. The inset axes show the Pearson correlation for different time lags (weeks).Full size imageSARS-CoV-2Figure 3 shows R(t), Td(t) and C&H index during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic period in the Netherlands, and provides additional information on the status of the vaccination program and dominance of the Original, Alpha, Delta, and Omicron variants. SARS-CoV-2 appeared in February 2020 in the Netherlands and the first hospital case was reported in February 27. The Dutch government defined several measures with rapidly increasing strength between February 27, 2020, and March 25, 2020, which is visible in the C&H index that increased from 0 to 60. This first intervention seems successful given the decline of R(t) between March 25 and May 1, 2020. The uncertainty in the computation of R(t) during the first months is relatively high. After June 12, 2020, the uncertainty in R(t) is smaller due to a change in the methodology to compute R(t), which was based on hospital admission before this date and data from the test centers afterward.Fig. 3: Reproduction number (R), dew point temperature (Td), and C&H index during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (month numbers in 2020–2022).The red, green, and yellow sections in C&H index graph indicate the periods that are further analyzed in Fig. 4. This graph indicates the periods that more than 50% of the Dutch population has received at least two vaccine doses and a booster, and the periods that the different SARS-CoV-2 (Original, Alpha, Delta, Omicrons) were found in more than 50% of pathogen surveillance results.Full size imageIn the summer of 2020, R(t) was mainly larger than 1.0. At the same time the intervention level was released somewhat compared to the first intervention period in March, C&H index <50, while the dew point temperature (4 days averaged) was larger than 12.0 °C for the entire summer. After the summer of 2020, the Dutch government responded with a new set of interventions, and the C&H index increased from 45 in July 2020 to 69 at the end of December 2020. The intervention level remained relatively high until mid-June 2021. In this period R(t) remained close to 1.0 but cumulatively this resulted in a high number of infections and ongoing pressure on the health system.The release of C&H index in June 2021 in combination with the arrival of the more contagious Delta strain of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the Netherlands resulted in a strong increase of R(t). In the summer of 2021, R(t) decreased again, but in the remainder of 2021 and 2022, many interventions were re-installed, the Omicron strain appeared and a booster vaccine dose was administrated.Figure 4 shows a more detailed analysis of selected periods, marked in Fig. 3, with a given dominant SARS-CoV-2 strain, a relatively constant C&H index, no large changes in the degree of vaccination, and a limited uncertainty in the computation of R(t). The Pearson correlation coefficient of Td(t) and R(t) is less than −0.8 (p < 1e–4) for the selected periods. In the period that the Omicron variants appeared there were large changes in C&H and vaccination status (booster). The Omicron variants resulted in less hospitalization, and were received as very contagious but mild variants. Therefore, it is questionable if the remaining measures, contained in the C&H index, are actually followed up in practice. For these reasons, we excluded an analysis of the Omicron period as we expect strong confounding with changes in policy, social factors, vaccine and infection-induced immunity, and changes in the characteristics of the virus (Omicron subvariants BA.1/2/5).Fig. 4: Reproduction number (R) and dew point temperature (Td) versus time (months) of selected periods indicated in Fig. 3, and a combined scatter plot of R versus Td.Red corresponds with the Original variant, green with the Alpha variant, and yellow with Delta. The black points in the scatter plot correspond with all data points. Dashed lines in the corresponding colors are based on a least-square linear regression.Full size imageFigure 5 shows the number of deceased persons in nursing homes D(t) and the estimated number of infectious persons N(t). It is seen that D(t) followed N(t) with some delay as expected. The remarkable observation is that the translation from N(t) to D(t) seems quite different in the first and third waves compared to the second wave, where the translation seems much slower. The fourth wave N(t) is not visible in D(t) anymore. This could be attributed to the progressing state of the vaccination program that started with the administration of vaccines in the nursing home care setting in January 18, 2021.Fig. 5: Deceased persons per day in nursing homes (blue line), daily number of infectious persons N(t) (red line), and the dew point temperature.From January 2020 to June 2021.Full size imageTable 1 shows that in periods with dry air (Td < 6.0 °C) the mean ratio N(t–12)/D(t) is between two to three thousand while in the periods with a higher humidity this ratio is significantly higher, around four to five thousand. Figure 6 shows a scatter plot of D(t) versus N(t–12) for dry and humid air conditions. The slopes of the regression lines visualize the difference in the mean ratio of N(t–12)/D(t), as reported in Table 1.Table 1 Comparison of the number of infectious persons in the Netherlands and deceased persons in nursing homes in different periods of time.Full size tableFig. 6: Number of deaths per day in the nursing home setting D(t) versus the estimated number of infectious persons in the Netherlands shifted by 12 days N(t–12).Data separation for dry-air transmission periods with an averaged dew point: Td < 6 °C (red), and humid-air transmission periods: Td > 6 °C (green). Dashed lines represent the corresponding least-square regression fit, with an estimated slope (95% confidence interval) in the range (22.4–26.0 1e–5) for humid-air periods and (34.0–40.7 1e–5) for dry-air periods.Full size imageDiscussionThese observations extend the associative evidence basis for the role of humidity on both the transmission of influenza and SARS-CoV-2. Hence, it seems in line with mechanistic considerations in the literature on droplet residence time, virus stability, and natural physiological defense, which are all negatively affected by low humidity. This supports the use of humidification as an NPI for the spread of both viruses during dry-air periods in temperate regions.The observed association between the dew point and excess mortality in influenza periods between 1995 and 2019 is consistent with a previously reported association between the specific humidity and the estimated prevalence of influenza in the Netherlands [33]. It is also consistent with other international studies on the meteorological determinants of the seasonality of influenza [31].The correlation between the reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 and the dew points are also consistent with a spatial-temporal analysis of hospital admission figures during the first wave of the pandemic in the Netherlands [33]. This result is also consistent with other international studies on the role of meteorological factors in the early development of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic [34, 35]. The relatively large number of nursing home deaths compared to the number of infectious persons in the Netherlands in dry air versus humid air is also consistent with the hypothesis that transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 in dry air is higher. It is also imaginable that airways are more vulnerable in dry air, especially for the older age groups, and that more serious symptoms develop, which could result in a higher fatality rate. From the present data, it was not possible to test this hypothesis.In this work, three methods were applied to control for the effect of government policy changes to allow for a study to the effect of a single environmental factor on the transmission of respiratory viruses: influenza periods 1995–2019 where interventions on a national level were absent, selection of a relatively constant intervention level in SARS-CoV-2 periods and by examining a specific setting with a focus on health care. This does not completely rule out the effect of changes in the interventions, for example, less mobility restrictions versus vaccine rollout to the next age group, or the presence of changes in individual hygiene [40] and societal change.Other environmental factors could have interfered with the analysis. In particular, the temperature strongly correlates with the dew point (pr = 0.87, p < 1e–4). A lower temperature, in combination with other meteorological variables, typically results in less ventilation rates in indoor spaces in winter versus summer months. This results in more rebreathing of exhaled breath of a possible infector that shares the same indoor space, and gives a significant increase to the risk of infection by long-range airborne transmission in the winter months [2]. Based on pre-pandemic measurements of CO2 concentrations in UK classrooms, the estimated number of secondary infections from a single infector entering a classroom, during a pre/asymptomatic period of 5 days, varies between 0.53 (0.35–0.70) in January and 0.28 (0.12–0.42) in July [2]. This calculation indicates that the reduction of ventilation is an important factor to take into account, but it probably cannot completely explain the observed variations in the population-based reproduction number. Thereby nothing that ventilation rates in most indoor spaces were likely higher in the period since autumn 2020 than in the pre-pandemic years and the number of persons sharing indoor spaces during a workday was less than the number of students in UK classrooms (N = 33). It was also concluded, by the same authors, that other factors like changing humidity should be taken into account to explain the seasonality of respiratory infections [2].Lower temperatures are also associated with longer indoor residence time, which is typically 21–22 h per day [40]. Two studies found that people spend 1–2 h longer indoors (+7%) during cold weather and about 0.5 h (+2%) longer during rainy days [41, 42]. The effect of extended indoor residence time by weather effects seems limited, but the contact patterns can significantly change. A study in Flanders, a neighboring region of the Netherlands, found that on cold days the number of contacts at schools and the number of contacts with a duration of more than 1 h was significantly larger on cold working days, while the number of contacts not related to work or school, such as leisure, transport, and private contacts, was markedly lower on cold working days [40]. This yields a mixed picture, and the net effect of changing social patterns as a function of meteorological variables on secondary viral transmission at the population level is uncertain. Moreover, during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, there were contact restrictions in many settings and periods, which further obscures the quantification of this effect. Also claims appeared on the effect of solar insolation on daily new SARS-CoV-2 cases [43] and conflicting claims on the effect of pollen concentrations in the atmosphere [44, 45]. These environmental variables also correlate with the dew point and temperature. Therefore, the results presented here should be regarded as purely associative.Nonetheless, based on the observed correlations and known physical mechanisms, it is recommended to conduct more prospective studies on the potential of humidity control as an NPI for SARS-CoV-2. Ideally, with a well-controlled methodology as applied for influenza in a previous study [10].ConclusionThe present analysis indicates that there is a strong negative association between humidity and the transmission of both SARS-CoV-2 and influenza. As such, the statistical results are in line with known mechanistic explanations for the adverse role of low humidity. In all, this indicates that there is a potential for active humidification as an NPI to reduce the spread of these viruses. A prospective analysis is required to provide further evidence for the suitability per social setting. Data availability All data sources used in the work are publicly available [36,37,38].

Alberta toll for this year’s outbreak has surpassed 1 million Wallis Snowdon · CBC News · Posted: Sep 16, 2022 8:01 AM EDT | Last Updated: September 16, 2022The Canadian Food Inspection Agency is investigating active outbreaks of avian flu in more than 50 flocks across Canada. (David Mdzinarishvili/Reuters)Social SharingAlberta chicken farmers are bracing for a second wave of avian flu infection this fall as the death toll among the province's flocks has surpassed one million. As migratory birds — natural carriers of the avian influenza virus — fly south, more cases are expected. And two newly-declared outbreaks on Alberta farms are putting already-strained poultry producers on edge. "We are all a little bit nervous about this fall migration," said Jeff Notenbomer, who owns Willow Creek Poultry, a broiler-breeding operation near Lethbridge.While there is hope that operators are better prepared to prevent infection, farmers are wondering where and when the next outbreak will happen, Notenbomer said. The new outbreaks and the return of birds like wild geese have renewed concern about the spread, he said."We did not know what we're going to see in the fall and now we're starting to see the start of something," said Notenbomer, who is also chair of Alberta Hatching Egg Producers, which regulates the production of broiler hatching in the province. "It is a concern." Poultry producers on edge as avian flu sweeps through Alberta farmsNunavut confirms 1st case of avian influenza in thick-billed murreMigratory birds are believed responsible for a string of outbreaks a highly-pathogenic avian influenza strain of H5N1, that is now responsible for the deaths of more than 2.3 million cases in Canadian flocks and string of outbreaks around the world. Cases waned this summer, following the spring migration period, but this year's global outbreak has already taken a toll on Alberta's flocks. The province has been the hardest hit in Canada.Avian influenza is a reportable disease in Canada. Federal inspectors respond to outbreaks by establishing quarantines zones and ordering the destruction of all birds on site. According to an update Wednesday from the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, an estimated 1,075,000 birds have been infected, 3,000 more than last week's update. The total includes birds that have died of the virus and others that have been euthanized. Cases have been detected at a total of 37 operations since Alberta’s first case was confirmed in Mountain View County on April 6th. There are 18 active outbreaks. (Ben Nelms/CBC)Outbreaks have been declared at a total of 37 operations since Alberta's first case was confirmed in Mountain View County on April 6. As of Wednesday, there were 18 active outbreaks.The latest outbreaks were declared Tuesday at farms in Starland County and the Municipal District of Willow Creek.The disease can spread to birds through contact with infected poultry and poultry products. The virus can spread on contaminated clothing, equipment, even the straw or shavings used as bedding in barns.Health officials say that while avian influenza can occasionally cause illness in humans, it is rare and would be the result of close contract with infected birds or heavily contaminated environments, not eating infected meat from an infected animal.With the Willow Creek outbreak around 20 kilometres from Notenbomer's farm, he's reassessing his biosecuirty protocols and hoping to keep infection out of his hatcheries. Avian influenza was first detected in Canada in 2004 but this year's strain is different.The new strain is highly transmissible, and appears to be sustaining itself within wild birds — particularly raptors, corvids and waterfowl species — while also killing them off in unprecendented numbers. (Canadian Food Inspection Agency )Margo Pybus, Alberta Fish and Wildlife's wildlife disease specialist, said it's important that farmers maintain strict biosecurity protocols in the weeks ahead.The risk of transmission between wild and domestic birds will be high.She also cautions that it is not clear what strain of virus migratory birds will bring back from their summer breeding grounds. Northern communities across Canada will be the first to find out. Alberta had a clearer picture of the infection risks during the spring, Pybus said.Birds flying north over the United States provided conservation and industry offfcials important clues about transmission and the severity of the new strain, before that risk flew into Alberta borders."In the spring, we were fortunate because we could see what was happening at the southern end of the migration route," she said."But for fall migration, it turns around. And now we're the first groups to to see any of the Arctic migrating birds as they go further south, so we really don't know what's going to happen." Migratory birds, including geese, are carriers for the avian flu virus and can transmit the infection to domesticated birds. (iStock/@arlutz73)Wild birds flying south this fall will be carriers but there is hope that the virus will have mutated, and may prove less virulent and less deadly, Pybus said.Just like COVID-19, the virus could become less severe as it spreads from host to host, she said. "We certainly hope that it won't be as deadly as the version of avian influenza that was there in the spring. But we won't know until those birds really start coming down in good numbers and finding out whether our surveillance program gives us reports of dead birds or not," she said. "We're all kind of holding our breath." Avian flu is devastating N.L.'s birds. This biologist has some ideas on how to curb itPresumptive cases of avian flu in skunks, foxes found in Sask.The province has been testing wild birds for signs of infection, she said. A wild case has not been detected since the end of July but the province will continue to investigate bird deaths to track any mutations. Dr. Dayna Goldsmith, a veterinary anatomical pathologist at the University of Calgary, said the strain has proved incredibly unpredciable with cases also being confirmed in mammals, including skunks and foxes.She said the hope is that wild and domesticated birds exposed to the virus this spring will have improved immunity against infection in coming weeks."Controlling disease on the wildlife side is always really difficult, especially with something like this that's so easily transmitted and can infect so many different species," she said. "Unfortunately, we kind of just have to let the population come to an equilibrium."OutdoorsTo hunt or not to hunt: Avian flu leads to duck hunters' dilemmaAvian flu may be killing Quebec harbour seals, scientists sayABOUT THE AUTHORWallis SnowdonReporterWallis Snowdon is a journalist with CBC Edmonton focused on bringing stories to the website and the airwaves.

Study: A Recombinant VSV-Based Bivalent Vaccine Effectively Protects against Both SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza A Virus Infection. Image Credit: Studio Romantic/Shutterstock The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been a serious global public health threat. Multiple vaccines have been used to prevent COVID-19, yet, the emergence of highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) has jeopardized the efforts to contain the pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 VOCs cause vaccine-breakthrough infections, thereby challenging the efficacy of existing COVID-19 vaccines and warranting the development of improved vaccines. Influenza is a contagious respiratory disease caused primarily by the influenza A virus (IAV). Seasonal influenza is a public health concern with more than 300,000 annual deaths. Influenza vaccines are the most effective means to prevent illness, but they are less effective (10% to 60%) due to the differences between the vaccine strain and circulating strains. Hence, designing a universal vaccine against all influenza strains is essential. Both influenza and COVID-19 are contagious diseases transmitted during the same seasons and pose a global threat to public health; as such, it is highly beneficial to design a vaccine that concurrently protects against SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses. The study and findings In the present study, researchers constructed three recombinant vesicular-stomatitis virus (rVSV)-based bivalent vaccine candidates for COVID-19 and influenza. First, they generated coding DNAs (cDNAs) encoding the spike protein (SP) of SARS-CoV-2 Delta with a 17 amino acids (aa) deletion in the C-terminus and a point mutation (I742A) [henceforth, SPΔC1]. Additionally, cDNAs encoding the S2 domain with a 381 aa deletion were constructed (SPΔC2). The receptor-binding domain (RBD) from the SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1 strain was fused with the glycoprotein (GP) of the Ebola virus to generate the ERBD cDNA construct. Each of the three cDNAs was inserted into the rVSV-EM2e vaccine vector, which contained the Ebola GP fused with four copies of influenza M2 ectodomain (M2e) polypeptide to generate V-EM2e/ SPΔC1, V-EM2e/ SPΔC2, or V-EM2e/ERBD. Two M2e copies were derived from human influenza strains, one from the avian flu strain and one from the swine flu strain. The replication ability of the candidate vaccines was examined in multiple cell lines such as A549, MRC-5, U251MG, cluster of differentiation 4-positive (CD4+) Jurkat T cells, and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) and dendritic cells (MDDCs). Although wild-type VSV exhibited efficient replication and typical cytopathic effects (CPEs) in various cell lines, rVSV candidates failed to infect MRC-5 and CD4+ Jurkat T cells. The vaccine candidates showed positive infection in other cell types and replicated much slower with less CPE than wild-type VSV. Two doses of each candidate vaccine were administered on days 0 and 14 in BALB/c mice through intramuscular (IM) or intranasal (IN) injection. Serum anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD and anti-M2 antibodies were measured. They found higher levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG antibodies with V-EM2e/ SPΔC1 and V-EM2e/ SPΔC2 candidates with IM administration than IN delivery. V-EM2e/ ERBD immunization via the IM route elicited much lower anti-RBD IgG antibodies than the other two vaccine candidates.

Next, they evaluated neutralizing potency of antibodies induced by the vaccine candidates using SPΔC pseudoviruses. V-EM2e/ SPΔC1 vaccine induced the highest titers of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) against SpΔCwildtype and SpΔCDelta pseudoviral infections, while V-EM2e/ERBD immunization had low neutralizing activity. Next, splenocytes from control and immunized mice were cultured without (any) peptides, with an S1 overlapping peptide pool or influenza M2e peptides. Stimulating IN-immunized mouse splenocytes with S1 or M2e peptides markedly increased the secretion of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and, to a lesser extent, interleukin (IL)-4 compared to controls. However, IL-5 production was not stimulated by either S1 or M2e peptides. In IM-immunized mouse splenocytes, elevated cytokine levels were evident before and remained unchanged after stimulation. Besides, mice immunized with V-EM2e/ SPΔC1 via IM or IN route were challenged with a lethal dose of H1N1 or H3N2 influenza strain on day 28. Control mice exhibited higher morbidity than immunized mice and lost > 20% weight by five/six days. In contrast, vaccinated mice exhibited moderate weight loss, with a 100% survival rate regardless of the vaccination route. Lastly, the authors investigated the protective effect of V-EM2e/ SPΔC1 and V-EM2e/ SPΔC2 immunization in Syrian hamsters against SARS-CoV-2 infection. The team observed that a single IM dose of either vaccine was adequate to elicit peak anti-spike IgG antibody titers. Hamsters were challenged with SARS-CoV-2 Delta 14 days after administering the second vaccine dose. Control hamsters (non-vaccinated) showed weight loss after infection and recovered by day 12. Vaccinated animals showed a marginal weight loss and began recuperating after two days. Oral swabs collected on day 3 showed significantly reduced viral RNA levels in vaccinated animals. Conclusions In summary, of the three bivalent vaccine candidates, V-EM2e/ SPΔC1 and V-EM2e/ SPΔC2 induced robust nAbs, humoral and cellular responses, and protected mice/hamsters against influenza (H1N1 and H3N2) and SARS-CoV-2 Delta infections. Taken together, the results provided substantial evidence for the excellent efficacy of the bivalent vaccine platform that could be expedited to create vaccines against novel or resurgent SARS-CoV-2 variants and IAV infections.

She uses her experience in medical research to ensure content is accurate across multiple Dotdash Meredith brands. health's fact checking process Close fotostorm/Getty Images Fast Facts Getting your COVID booster as soon as possible and waiting a few weeks to get your flu shot may provide the best protection against both diseases. People can choose to get both vaccines done at the same time, however, as it’s more convenient and experts aren't sure when flu and COVID surges might peak this winter.Vaccination timelines are largely left up to each individual, but experts say the most important thing is to just get both shots. Americans are being advised that COVID shots could become an annual tradition much like the flu vaccine. But even though these shots may begin to follow similar timelines going forward, deciding when to get each one this fall may not be so simple. At a recent White House press briefing government health officials offered some guidance for what the path forward may look like. "You can get both your flu shot and COVID shot at the same time. It's actually a good idea," Ashish Jha, MD, the White House's COVID response coordinator, said during the White House press conference. "I really believe this is why God gave us two arms—one for the flu shot and the other one for the COVID shot." This messaging certainly makes vaccination less complicated, but the timelines for these two shots may not actually line up so easily. Anthony Fauci, MD, Biden's chief medical advisor, advised in the press briefing that those who are eligible should get a COVID booster as soon as possible, but most experts don't recommend flu vaccination until October. So, is it better to get your COVID right now on its own and wait until October to get the flu shot? Or get them simultaneously as recommended? Experts explain why the date you get vaccinated matters, and what to take into consideration before booking your COVID and flu shot appointments this fall. Spacing Out Shots to Get Maximum Protection The question of when to time your vaccinations can be complicated to answer. If you're willing to make two separate appointments, it may be best to get your COVID booster now, and then return to get your flu shot in October, explains Gabriela Andujar Vazquez, MD, an infectious disease physician and associate hospital epidemiologist at Tufts Medical Center. "What I recommend [to] my patients—which doesn't necessarily fit to everyone, this is just in general—would be to get the COVID-19 bivalent booster now around this time, because there's still COVID circulating and we're coming into fall," Dr. Andujar Vazquez told Health. "The flu vaccine, maybe get it around October, where we know that by that time, it's likely that flu will start picking up in the next weeks to months going into winter." Though this timeline might give you optimal protection against flu and COVID, there's certainly nothing wrong with getting them at the same time, as many other public health officials have suggested, she added. "Some people prefer to just get it over with, and that's perfectly fine," Dr. Andujar Vazquez said. "Both options are okay, as long as you get the vaccine." Though getting both vaccines—at any time or in any order—is certainly better than the alternative of not getting them at all, the protection they offer does wane over time, which is why experts are so strongly suggesting that people get COVID boosters as soon as possible. Waiting a couple weeks to get your flu shot may mean you'll have a higher degree of protection when flu season hits its peak, which is usually between December and February. For people who are vaccinated against flu, their odds of catching the virus increase by 16% for every 28 days after they first get their shot, a 2019 study found. Those first two weeks post-vaccination are when you get the most protection, Dr. Andujar Vazquez explained, and the immunity naturally wanes. The worry is that for people who get their flu shot now, their protection may not be as robust by the time flu season kicks into full swing later in the winter. The Case for Two Shots at Once The other consideration that makes timing your vaccination so challenging is that experts can only guess at when virus surges might hit. Based on the past two years, we'll likely see some kind of increase in COVID cases this fall and winter, explained Andrew Pekosz, PhD, professor and vice chair in the department of molecular microbiology and immunology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Though flu is usually at its worst between December and January, there's no guarantee that that peak won't come earlier or later. Last year, flu cases were high much later in the spring than normal, and there are some fears that the flu might be atypical yet again this season. "Australia and other countries in the Southern Hemisphere had a rough influenza season. It was Australia's worst flu season in five years and it came earlier than any other influenza season, with the exception of the 2009 pandemic," Pekosz said in a press briefing. The flu season in countries in the Southern Hemisphere are usually indicators of what the U.S. might experience, so it's very possible that if flu does come early this year, it could overlap with a fall surge in COVID cases as well, Pekosz said. With the timing of the surges being more unpredictable, there's certainly sound reasoning behind getting both shots together—and soon—to be protected, just in case a surge hits early. Convenience Factor Another reason to get both shots at once is just sheer convenience. Getting vaccinated requires time and effort out of your day, so it's certainly easier to not have to book multiple appointments. It also may lessen the likelihood of people forgetting to come back for their second shot, too. "I would think about the influenza vaccine in the same way you're thinking about the bivalent COVID 19 vaccine—both of those are needed, both of those should be scheduled as soon as possible, and ideally at the same time so that one doesn't fall into the trap of getting one [vaccine] and then just forgetting to go back for the other," Pekosz said. Spacing out the two shots—getting the COVID booster now and waiting until October to get your flu shot—may be your best bet at maximizing your protection. But if you do want to do them at the same time, don't wait, Dr. Andujar Vazquez said. "Maybe in an earlier cycle, like early October, we might start seeing [flu] cases. It's never wrong to just get it now in September when we usually start seeing some here and there," Dr. Andujar Vazquez said. "Now that we have the bivalent booster and the flu vaccine, it makes sense to just get it this month, and then you're ready for both." Annual COVID Vaccine: U.S. Tries 'New Approach' With Omicron Boosters Timeline is Different for Everyone Though the vaccination timeline for flu and COVID shots is mostly left up to each person's discretion, experts say that people who were recently exposed to COVID should probably wait to get your booster for now. "Boosters are most effective when there's some time spaced between your initial, either vaccination or infection, and the time that the boosters are given. Two to three months is a good starting point," said Pekosz. "Many immunologists would say that even extending that out to as much as six months would be good to stimulate those memory responses, those responses that are going to be there, be prepared, and ready to respond to you when you are getting infected." Though when you get the vaccines may vary based on your medical history, schedule, or personal preferences, the most important thing is to get out and get both shots this fall. "It's just depending on your individual needs. But in general you can get both at the same time," Dr. Andujar Vazquez said. "Of course everyone should get both of them as of now, [now] that we're entering the colder months." Was this page helpful? Thanks for your feedback! Tell us why!

Flu season will soon be in full swing, and while it is recommended that all people get vaccinated to help prevent getting the flu, older adults, and seniors in particular need to be extra cautious.That’s because people who are 65 years and older are at higher risk of developing serious complications from the influenza virus (a.k.a. the flu) when compared with younger adults. To make a case for the flu vaccine among Medicare-eligible adults, we scoured the web for stats on some of the dangers that the flu poses for older adults, the complications it can cause, as well as the efficacy and benefits of getting the shot. 1. Last year, 67.3% of seniors ages 65-plus reported receiving a flu vaccine. (Source: America’s Health Rankings) 2. It’s estimated that between 70% and 85% of seasonal flu-related deaths have occurred in people 65 years and older. (Source: CDC) 3. Between 50% and 70% of seasonal flu-related hospitalizations have occurred among people 65 years and older. (Source: CDC) 4. There are other risk factors that are not as obvious. For example, the flu increases the risk of heart attack by three to five times. (Source: National Foundation for Infectious Disease) 5. The flu also increases the risk for stroke by two to three times in the first two weeks of infection for those aged 65-plus. (Source: National Foundation for Infectious Disease) 6. Taking into account the various complications that can be caused by the flu, seniors ages 65-plus are at a six-time higher risk of dying from flu and related complications than younger, heathier adults. (Source: National Foundation for Infectious Disease) 7. And the dangers of the flu only grow with age. The death rate from pneumonia and influenza is close to 130 times higher in people who are 85 years of age and older, compared to people ages 45 to 54. This increased risk due to age is even higher than that seen in heart disease, stroke, cancer, and other leading causes of death. (Source: Silverbook) 8. Flu vaccination has reduced the risk of medically attended illness (i.e. illness that results in care from a health care professional) caused by H1N1 or influenza B viruses by more than 60% among people 65 years and older. (Source: CDC) 9. Seniors in the Black community are about 20% less likely than their white counterparts to get flu shots, even though they are at higher risk of severe flu. Even those who do get the vaccine are about 30% less likely to get the high-dose version. (Source: KHN) 10. On June 30, 2022, the CDC announced continued support for a recommendation to use the higher dose flu vaccines for adults 65 years and older. Available evidence indicates that vaccinating older adults with the high-dose vaccine leads to a stronger immune response against influenza than the regular-dose vaccine. Fluzone, for example, a high-dose flu vaccine, was found to be 24% more effective in preventing flu in adults 65 years and older relative to a standard-dose vaccine. (Source: New England Journal of Medicine) COVID-19 has gotten all the headlines lately, but it is important to remember that the flu can also be deadly, especially to older adults. The good news is that you can now get vaccinated for both at the same time. Medicare and Medicare Advantage plans cover the cost of a flu vaccine as long as the customer visits a participating provider. Vaccines are generally available not only at doctor’s offices, but also at urgent care centers and pharmacies. Some insurers, like Cigna, will even provide customers with an incentive to get the flu vaccine. Since there are different types of vaccines available, you should always talk to your doctor about which one is right for you. Watch the video below to learn more about flu, pneumonia, COVID-19, and the common cold. Learn key distinctions between them and ways you can help prevent yourself, and others, from getting sick.

Flu (influenza) and Covid-19 are both contagious respiratory illnesses and have similar symptoms such as fever, cough, difficulty in breathing, tiredness, sore throat, mucous, muscle pain, headache and loss of smell and taste, among others, but they are caused by different viruses. This means that someone with these symptoms cannot be sure which one they have caught. However, chemists in Spain now have a test which can tell the difference and it means that anyone who suspects they have flu or Covid is able to take one of these tests at home to find out. They determine whether the cause of the symptoms is influenza A, influenza B or Covid. Noticia Relacionada Bad flu season coming up, Spanish public health experts warn Ángel Escalera They work exactly the same way as the rapid Covid tests. A nasal swab is taken and placed in a tube with reactive liquid, and then a few drops are put onto the testing strip. In 20 minutes each virus will be marked either positive or negative. Price capped There will be a control line and three test lines: one for influenza A, one for influenza B and a third for Covid-19. If the test has been carried out correctly, the control line (C) will always appear. If a red line appears for Covid (it can be identified with different letters of the alphabet, for example T or S), the person can take it that they have Covid depending on the intensity of the line. The same goes for influenza A and B. If there is a red line, the result is positive. If the control line is red and the other three are white, there is no flu or Covid infection. The test should be carried out within seven days of the first symptoms appearing, although it can also be done by people with no symptoms. With regard to the price, this is capped at 2.94 euros.

Waterfowlers have avian flu to deal with this season, but many still plan to huntGord Follett · CBC News · Posted: Sep 11, 2022 5:30 AM EDT | Last Updated: September 11, 2022Eider ducks and icebergs are pictured off Cape Race on Newfoundland’s southern shore. (Submitted by Cliff Doran)Social SharingThis column is an opinion by Gord Follett, former editor of Newfoundland Sportsman. For more information about CBC's Opinion section, please see the FAQ.Not by any stretch of the imagination do I consider myself an avid waterfowler. Even "fairly serious" would be pushing it.Since my last goose and duck hunt in Prince Edward Island about eight years ago, waterfowling has been more of an incidental hunt for me, meaning I was after other small game such as rabbits or grouse and happened upon a few freshwater ducks or couple geese in a pond or gully. It's also been about that long since I've ridden the Atlantic Ocean hunting eider ducks and turrs.Over the past couple of months, however, I've been thinking about duck hunting quite a bit — specifically about what some of my die-hard duck hunting buddies and waterfowlers in general across Newfoundland and Labrador are going to do, now that avian influenza has become so rampant in these parts. Even though it happens rarely, it can still pose a serious health risk to humans. There certainly is a dilemma for us this year- Peter Emberley, hunterThousands of seabirds such as common murres (also known as turrs), gulls and gannets have been washing up along our coasts this summer; some already dead, others on shorelines, dying slow deaths that have been heart-wrenching to watch. Some freshwater birds have also tested positive for the virus.Local waterfowlers, perhaps the most passionate group of hunters out there, appear to be facing quite a dilemma this year: will they still hunt?If so, will they consume the birds they kill? Aren't they concerned for their own health?I've spoken to numerous duck hunters in recent weeks, and while I wasn't completely shocked, I was somewhat surprised to discover that most of them — almost 75 per cent of the 90-plus I've contacted around the province as part of my mini-survey — have every intention of continuing with their favourite hunt again this year. (The season for freshwater ducks and geese begins Sept. 17, while startup dates for eider ducks and other seabirds are usually in October and November, depending on hunting zones.)Peter Emberley Sr., right, and his son Peter Emberley Jr. display the results of a morning duck hunt on the Avalon Peninsula. (Submitted by Peter Emberley)To hunt or not to hunt"There certainly is a dilemma for us this year," admitted Peter Emberley of St. John's."The day before duck season is usually known to us as 'Ducks Eve,' just like Christmas Eve for the kids. It's all we talk about. We breathe, sleep and dream about ducks and we break out the duck calls and start practising couple weeks before it opens. This year, however, that feeling is tarnished with the bird flu."It's not the first time we've been warned, but this is the first time dead birds have been seen around the coastal waters all over the island. Plenty of hunters are of two minds on whether to hunt. I've heard some say they will hunt opening day but will not consume the birds. For me, that's not an option. If I hunt, I can't waste the bird. It goes against everything I believe in. If I don't [plan to] eat it, I don't shoot it."It was only within the past couple of weeks that Emberley made the decision to hunt this year, though he will take precautions."This disease seems to affect the birds more so in coastal waters than our local ponds, lakes and gullies," he said. That's not to say it's not inland as well, he added."I invested in a picker that isn't made of wood, so it can be thoroughly disinfected after each use. The birds will have to be handled with extra care once the processing begins and again when it's time to cook them. We will pick up some aprons and long gloves when we handle the birds, just to be safe."Waterfowl across Newfoundland, including ducks at Quidi Vidi Lake, have tested positive for the bird flu. (Submitted by Gord Follett)Season uncertaintyAvid seabird hunter Blake Russell of Lewisporte, who is currently aboard a tanker in the Arctic on a work term, will be cruising the Atlantic in search of ducks and turrs again this coming season — if there is an open season for turrs, and indications as I write this point to a season closure."Most turrs and ducks we kill are coming from the north; seems like most of the sick turrs on the northeast coast are from the Funks [Funk Islands]," Russell said."We usually wait for the northern turrs anyway, which come later … and I have seen no sign of sick eiders or turrs up here in Hudson Bay and Baffin area. If I were home, I'd be hunting turrs this year, but we'd just be a bit more cautious, I guess. But I'll definitely be hunting eiders when I'm off this winter."Rob Stringer of Caplin Cove, Trinity Bay, was looking forward to the coming season, just as he always does, but says his goose gun and trusty yellow Lab Molly won't be seeing much action in 2022."I just can't take a chance with this bird flu," he said, adding that at least five of his Voisey's Bay co-workers feel the same way.On Newfoundland's southwest coast, Mark Lomond, administrator of the Facebook group Duck Hunters of Newfoundland, said he will "most certainly" be hunting ducks this year."All my buddies are saying the same thing," he added.While this strain of H5N1 is more widespread this year, he said, "it has always been present to some extent in our local bird populations."Lomond's main concern right now isn't his own health but that of his chickens, he said, as he has a small hobby farm and this strain of avian influenza is deadly to poultry. Other than taking several precautions to protect them, he said, "everything else will be status quo" with regard to his hunting habits.Read more from CBC Newfoundland and LabradorABOUT THE AUTHORGord FollettFreelance contributorGord Follett is a former editor of the Newfoundland Sportsman magazine, former co-host of the Newfoundland Sportsman TV program and best-selling author of Track Shoes & Shotguns.

YonhapHealth authorities on Friday issued an advisory over a possible seasonal influenza outbreak across the country, the first of its kind since 2019, amid growing concerns of a possible "twindemic" ― simultaneous outbreaks of COVID-19 and the flu ― this fall and winter.The Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) said the advisory was issued after the national influenza-like illness (ILI) case rate was tallied at 5.1 per 1,000 people from Sept. 4 to last Saturday.The advisory was issued relatively early in the season compared with past ones, which had been announced around November or December.Korea has not seen a flu outbreak in the past two years due largely to the government-mandated social distancing schemes. The KDCA said it has strengthened its flu advisory standard due to concerns over the potential twindemic situation.The agency requested that childcare facilities, schools and nursing facilities strengthen influenza prevention and management schemes. The KDCA plans to begin administering seasonal flu shots to high-risk groups ― children aged 6 months through 13 years old, pregnant mothers and seniors over 65 ― next Wednesday at some 20,000 hospitals and medical facilities nationwide.

begins Phase 3 clinical trial of mRNA-based Influenza vaccine Written by Ruchika Sharma Published On 2022-09-15T11:00:09+05:30 | Updated On 15 Feb 2024 5:44 PM ISTNew York: Pfizer Inc. has announced that the first participants have been dosed in a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of the company's quadrivalent modified RNA (modRNA) influenza vaccine candidate in approximately 25,000 healthy U.S. adults."For years, there has been a need to better address the burden of influenza, despite the use of existing seasonal flu vaccines. Our experience with RNA viruses and mRNA technology has given us an even deeper understanding of the opportunity to potentially provide more efficacious vaccines that could further reduce the yearly rates of the severe outcomes of viral disease like flu, including hospitalization and death," said Annaliesa Anderson, Ph.D., Senior Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer, Vaccine Research and Development, Pfizer. "We are excited to start the first Phase 3 efficacy study of an mRNA-based influenza vaccine that could potentially deliver an improved flu vaccine to help address the significant burden of this disease."Each year, even when currently available vaccine strains match circulating influenza virus strains well, those vaccines typically confer only 40% to 60% protection, with even lower protection in years with poor matching of strains. With circulating influenza strains continually changing, predicting the best match for the next season's vaccine is difficult for global health experts as those strains are chosen more than six months before the start of the influenza season that they target. The flexibility of mRNA technology and its rapid manufacturing could potentially allow better strain matches in future years, and in a pandemic influenza situation, mRNA technology could allow rapid, large-scale manufacturing of vaccines. mRNA-based influenza vaccines require only the genetic sequence of the virus.Influenza annually causes 140,000 to 710,000 hospitalizations, 12,000 to 52,000 deaths and about $25 billion in economic loss in the U.S. The impact of flu on racial and ethnic minority groups in the U.S. is even larger. Black Americans are 1.8 times more likely than their white counterparts to be hospitalized for flu while Latino and Indigenous Americans are 1.2 and 1.3 times more likely, respectively. Although vaccination remains one of the best ways to help prevent infection and serious illness, racial and ethnic minority communities in the U.S. continue to be vaccinated at lower rates, and clinical trial enrollment for new or improved vaccines tend to lack diversity. The quadrivalent modRNA vaccine candidate will encode World Health Organization recommended strains for the Northern Hemisphere 2022-23 cell culture- or recombinant-based influenza vaccines.In 2018, Pfizer entered into a worldwide collaboration and license agreement with BioNTech under which Pfizer has the exclusive right to carry out the clinical development and commercialization of mRNA‐based influenza vaccines. Upon potential approval and commercialization, BioNTech would receive a royalty on Pfizer's sales.Read also: Pfizer, BioNTech Omicron BA.4/BA.5-Adapted Bivalent COVID-19 Vaccine Booster get CHMP nodpfizerpfizer newsclinical trialquadrivalent modified RNA influenza vaccineinfluenzainfluenza vaccineRuchika SharmaRuchika Sharma joined Medical Dialogue as an Correspondent for the Business Section in 2019.

We would have had a reintroduction of travel, bringing things from other countries into our population in a pattern that would differ from other years because there was a reduction in mobility, followed by the removal of those restrictions and spikes in travel at points in time that don’t correspond to the normal travel period.” Loop is better in the app. Customize your news feed, save articles for later, view your reading history and more.

File photo: RTHK Health Secretary Lo Chung-mau on Thursday refuted suggestions that Covid-19 is as mild as flu, calling such comments misleading. Writing on his blog, he hit back at medical experts who pointed out that the latest fatality rate of the coronavirus in Hong Kong was similar to that of influenza, at about 0.1 percent. “Some people think the Centre for Health Protection should exclude the number of deaths at the peak of the Omicron outbreak earlier this year and only take into account the 0.1 percent fatality rate of Covid since May. This is a serious mistake. It disregards thousands of people who died of Covid-19, and misleads people into taking the pandemic lightly,” he wrote. Lo reiterated the fatality rate of Covid-19 in Hong Kong since the pandemic started in 2020 is 0.6 per cent, with more than 9,500 deaths among almost 1.57 million people infected. “We understand that after more than two years, people hope the epidemic will be brought under control as soon as possible,” he wrote. “However, using the death figures from May onwards... is a generalisation that would make people feel numb about the coronavirus situation and hinder our anti-epidemic work.” Lo noted that Omicron is more transmissible and mutates more quickly than flu, adding that some of those infected could develop long Covid. He added that children who are infected with Covid-19 are more susceptible to complications and deaths. A specialist in respiratory medicine, Leung Chi-chiu, said the severity of Covid-19 should not be judged based on its fatality rate alone. “With vaccination, early detection and antivirals, recent Covid-19 case fatality ratio approaches seasonal flu of about 0.1 percent in Hong Kong and Singapore. However, this is (the) result of active intervention, and not intrinsic virus property,” Leung noted. He also said although the fatality rate of Covid-19 in Hong Kong has become lower, people should not underestimate the pandemic as the possible emergence of new variants capable of evading antibodies acquired from vaccination and prior infection could lead to explosive infection outbreaks and overwhelm the healthcare system.

It’s the same peo­ple, the same ma­chines, it’s re­al­ly whether you use them to do one test or an­oth­er, so it may not be a fair com­par­i­son,” he said.This year, he said test­ing has been in­creased for res­pi­ra­to­ry ail­ments, which could be why larg­er num­bers of in­fluen­za are record­ed.In­fluen­za sea­son runs from Oc­to­ber to May but Hinds said it can spread out­side of this win­dow.“In­fluen­za doesn’t ac­tu­al­ly read the book on sea­sons, so in­fluen­za will spread once it gets in­to a pop­u­la­tion and there’s lots of move­ment,” he said.“We had a lot of move­ment with­in this Ju­ly/Au­gust pe­ri­od. We would have had a rein­tro­duc­tion of trav­el, bring­ing things from oth­er coun­tries in­to our pop­u­la­tion in a pat­tern that would dif­fer from oth­er years be­cause there was a re­duc­tion in mo­bil­i­ty, fol­lowed by a re­moval of those re­stric­tions and spikes in trav­el in points in time that don’t cor­re­spond to the nor­mal trav­el pe­ri­od.”On the COVID-19 front, he said there was a de­crease in new in­fec­tions, which he hopes is a sign the BA.5 Omi­cron sub-lin­eage has run its course.

The current circulating subtype seems to be more the H3N2 than anything else... Influenza, though, seems to be one of the more dominant of the non-Covid diagnoses that are now coming through the laboratory and with the upward trend in Covid which is transmitted the same way as influenza, we did see similar trends in influenza infections between about week 28 and week 36.”“Those are basically tied together by the root of transmission, and they are also tied together by the fact that they can be reduced by both vaccination and by the existing public health measures and recommendations.“The movement that we would have seen, the openings, the reduction of the mask wearing with the removal of the mask mandate, all of those things would also have the same impact on the transmission of anything respiratory... The upward trend mirrored the upward trend in Covid-19 during this July-August period,” he added.As such, he yesterday warned the public, especially those with chronic illnesses, pregnant women, children in school, and anyone who is in the routine vaccination groups for influenza to get their annual influenza vaccine.Additionally, he said the number of cases of influenza for 2022 thus far has exceeded the number of cases that would have been detected and documented last year.However, he explained the ministry primarily focused on testing for Covid-19 last year, at the expense of testing for other illnesses because the resources for testing for all the viruses are shared.Travel bugsThough it is not currently influenza season, which typically peaks between October and May, Hinds explained the reintroduction of travel brought things from other countries into the popu­lation in a pattern that differed from other years.He said it is more likely that influenza cases may continue to increase, as there is more transmission in the colder climates and more travel from the colder climates to Trinidad and Tobago.On Sunday, Health Minister Terrence Deyalsingh revealed he was hospitalised for swine flu.On August 29, the ministry released a statement stating Deyalsingh had been admitted to the Arima General Hospital for flu-like symptoms, but that Covid-19 had been ruled out as the cause.When asked about the prevalence of hand-foot-and-mouth disease in schools, Hinds said though he has not received any confirmed cases lately, it is not uncommon at this time.He said once there are children in close proximity and contact, it can occur.However, he said it is not a worrying situation since schools and county medical officers of health know are well able to treat with it.

With the launch of the campaign, members of the community will be able to receive their free seasonal influenza vaccines at all primary health centers, HMC outpatient clinics and at more than 45 private and semi-private clinics and hospitals across Qatar. Chair of the National Health Strategic Group on COVID-19 and Head of the Infectious Diseases Division at HMC Dr. Abdullatif Al Khal said the health sector was taking a proactive approach and starting the vaccination campaign in early September. "Usually, people are exposed to a variety of flu strains every year, which helps to build up immunity to the virus. But with little flu in the past two seasons due in part to COVID-19, that immunity has waned," Dr. Al Khal said. "The circulating flu viruses change from year to year which is why it is important to receive the flu vaccine annually. It is important that we do not become complacent - flu is a serious disease that can lead to hospitalization and sometimes, even death, and should never be underestimated," he added. Manager, Health Protection and Communicable Diseases at MOPH, Dr. Hamad Al Romaihi said while the flu is a serious illness and everyone 6 months of age and older should take the vaccine to protect themselves, some groups are more vulnerable than others. "People of all ages and health conditions can get the flu and become sick, but there are certain key population groups who are at increased risk," Dr. Al Romaihi said. "These are people aged over 50 years; those with chronic conditions regardless of their age; children aged between six months and five years; pregnant women; and healthcare workers and teachers, due to their close interaction with vulnerable patients and children." Manager, Health Protection, Preventive Health Directorate at PHCC, Dr. Khalid Hamid Elawad encouraged the community to take the flu vaccine as soon as possible. "I urge all of you to take the flu vaccine as soon as possible - maximum protection against the flu takes up to two weeks to develop so the sooner people get vaccinated, the sooner they will be protected. It is also important for people to know they can receive the flu and COVID-19 vaccines at the same time, or within a short period of time before or after each other. Clinical studies have shown that this is safe and does not affect the efficacy of either vaccine. (QNA) Health care officials called on community members not to underestimate the seasonal flu this year, stressing the need to receive influenza vaccinations and not to underestimate the severity of the flu.
