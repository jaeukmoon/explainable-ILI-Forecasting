The impact of memory induced by prior infection is rarely considered and is difficult to ascertain, because infections are often subclinical. This study investigated influenza vaccination among adults from the Ha Nam cohort (Vietnam), who were purposefully selected to include 72 with and 28 without documented influenza A(H3N2) infection during the preceding 9 years (Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry 12621000110886). The primary outcome was the effect of prior influenza A(H3N2) infection on hemagglutinin-inhibiting antibody responses induced by a locally available influenza vaccine administered in November 2016. Baseline and postvaccination sera were titrated against 40 influenza A(H3N2) strains spanning 1968–2018. At each time point (baseline, day 14 and day 280), geometric mean antibody titers against 2008–2018 strains were higher among participants with recent infection (34 (29–40), 187 (154–227) and 86 (72–103)) than among participants without recent infection (19 (17–22), 91 (64–130) and 38 (30–49)). On days 14 and 280, mean titer rises against 2014–2018 strains were 6.1-fold (5.0- to 7.4-fold) and 2.6-fold (2.2- to 3.1-fold) for participants with recent infection versus 4.8-fold (3.5- to 6.7-fold) and 1.9-fold (1.5- to 2.3-fold) for those without. One of 72 vaccinees with recent infection versus 4 of 28 without developed symptomatic A(H3N2) infection in the season after vaccination (P = 0.021). The range of A(H3N2) viruses recognized by vaccine-induced antibodies was associated with the prior infection strain. These results suggest that recall of immunological memory induced by prior infection enhances antibody responses to inactivated influenza vaccine and is important to attain protective antibody titers.

Percentages female (F) and median age in years (Y) are shown at each step. Selection for the vaccine study was limited to participants aged ≥ 18 years (n = 556), who registered interest in participating in sub-studies involving vaccination and/or additional blood samples when re-consented in July 2016 (n = 371). Selection was further limited participants who had provided blood samples at all 12 time points since Dec-2007, and who had been present during all influenza transmission periods (n = 161). Only 32 participants lacked a detectable A(H3N2) infection, and all were selected. 82/129 who had an A(H3N2) infection were then selected based on similarity of age to participants without prior infection, and sex. For each participant lacking recent infection, we selected two to three recently infected participants who were nearest in age, while selecting 3 females selected for every 2 males (S. Table 1). 14 of 114 selected participants were excluded or did not consent. Age and proportion female were similar among non-selected, selected and consenting participants, with the exception that participants with missing blood collections and/or absent during surveillance periods were younger and fewer were female.Extended Data Fig. 2 Antibody responses to the vaccine A(H3N2) strain, by age and prior A(H3N2) infection status and age group.a, Titers against egg-grown A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 are plotted against participant age and prior infection status (color coded, legend) for the time points indicated. Linear regression lines are shown for each group with 95% confidence intervals. Pearsons correlation coefficients are shown with 2-sided p values. b, GMTs and c, GMRs are shown for participants stratified by prior infection and age group (color coded, legend) at the indicated time points. Symbols indicate mean values and error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals. Numbers per age group with no recent A(H3N2) are: 1935–59, n = 8; 1960–60, n = 9; 1970–79, n = 6; 1980–86, n = 5. Numbers per age group with recent A(H3N2) are: 1935–59, n = 16; 1960–60, n = 27; 1970–79, n = 21; 1980–86, n = 8. Horizontal lines indicate cut-offs for seropositivity or seroconversion.Extended Data Fig. 3 Antibody titers across age groups in participants with and without A(H3N2) virus infection since 2007.GAMs were used to fit titres and titre increments by virus circulation year and participant age. Participants with (n = 72) and without (n = 28) recent A(H3N2) virus infection are compared. Titre rise against the oldest strains was limited among the youngest participants and increased with increasing participant age. Titres and titre rises across strains were greater among participants with prior infection irrespective of age, indicating that effects of recent infection were not strongly age dependent.Extended Data Fig. 4 Antibody titers and titer rises by number of recent A(H3N2) infections.a, GMTs against individual strains spanning 2008 to 2018 are compared for participants with 0, 1 or 2–3 recent infections (legend). b, GMTs and c, GMRs averaged across 2014 to 2018 strains were compared. a–c, symbols indicate mean values and error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals. Horizontal lines represent cut-offs for seropositivity or seroconversion. Red panels in a highlight the vaccine strain. Samples sizes for all plots are shown in panel a.Extended Data Fig. 5 Antibody titers and titer rises by year of last A(H3N2) infection.a, GMTs against individual strains spanning 2008 to 2018 are compared by year of last infection (legend). b, GMTs and c, GMRs averaged across 2014 to 2018 strains are compared. a-c, symbols indicate mean values and error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals.

The flock had a total of eight birds in it. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) confirmed the presence of HPAI after samples from the flock were tested at the Cornell University Animal Health Diagnostic Center and confirmed at the APHIS National Veterinary Services Laboratories in Ames, Iowa. The New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets (AGM) is working closely with USDA APHIS on a joint incident response. The announcement prompts reminders for commercial and hobby poultry farmers to increase their biosecurity measures to help prevent the spread of the disease. AGM officials have quarantined the affected premises in Suffolk County, and the small number of remaining birds on the property will be depopulated to prevent the spread of the disease. Birds from the flock will not enter the food system. As part of existing avian influenza response plans, AGM and USDA are working jointly on additional surveillance and testing in areas around the affected flock. To date, additional cases of HPAI have been confirmed in wild birds in South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, New Hampshire, Connecticut, Georgia, and Florida. Cases have also been detected in commercial flocks in Indiana and Kentucky, and a backyard flock in Virginia. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, these recent HPAI detections in birds do not present an immediate public health concern. No human cases of these avian influenza viruses have been detected in the United States. As a reminder, the proper handling and cooking of poultry and eggs to an internal temperature of 165 ˚F kills bacteria and viruses. Further information about the USDA response can be found on their website. State Agriculture Commissioner Richard A. Ball said, “Avian influenza outbreaks can spread quickly. We will continue to do all we can at the Department to safeguard the state’s flocks and encourage everyone who keeps poultry to be vigilant about minimizing their birds’ exposure to the virus and to wild bird populations. Our poultry industry is a significant part of the state’s agricultural industry and these biosecurity steps are our best line of defense against the disease.” AGM officials are reaching out to poultry and egg farms across the state to ensure best practices are being implemented and to prepare for potential additional avian influenza cases in New York. The Department encourages those involved in poultry production to take extra steps to prevent their flocks from becoming infected. All poultry producers, from small backyard to large commercial operations, should review their biosecurity plans and take precautions to protect their birds. Poultry biosecurity materials and checklists can be found on the USDA’s “Defend the Flock” website. Best practices include: Discourage unnecessary visitors and use biosecurity signs to warn people not to enter buildings without permission. Ask all visitors if they have had any contact with any birds in the past five days. Forbid entry to employees and visitors who own any kind of fowl. Require all visitors to cover and disinfect all footwear. Lock all entrances to chicken houses after hours. Avoid non-essential vehicular traffic on-farm. After hauling birds to processors, clean and disinfect poultry transport coops and vehicles before they return to the farm. Report anything unusual, especially sick or dead birds, to AGM. In addition to practicing good biosecurity, poultry owners should keep their birds away from wild ducks and geese and their droppings. Outdoor access for poultry should be limited at this time. To report sick birds, unexplained high number of deaths, or sudden drop in egg production, please contact AGM’s Division of Animal Industry at (518) 457-3502 or the USDA at (866) 536-7593.

Study: Functional Microfiber Nonwoven Fabric with Sialic Acid-Immobilized Polymer Brush for Capturing Lectin in Aerosol. Image Credit: pinkeyes/Shutterstock.com The MNWF was fabricated using radiation-induced graft polymerization (RIGP), and the sialic acid imitated the sugar chain cluster effect to trap the influenza virus. They tested the efficiency of two types of sialic acids or acid mixtures against a substitute of original HA lectin, i.e., wheat germ agglutinin (WGA). They found that the degree of grafting (dg) had a significant but variable effect on the amount of absorbed lectin. Background Related StoriesCharacterizing Virus and Virus-Like ParticlesBoron Nitride - Surface Coating of Materials with BN Aerosol Spray by Precision CeramicsABB Assists New Zealand's Watercare in Meeting New Fluoride Monitoring RegulationsInfluenza is a viral contagious respiratory disease that has been causing seasonal epidemics in mammals for decades. While type A, B, and C are known to affect human beings, type D has been found in cattle and pigs. These viruses are more active in high humidity and low-temperature conditions, especially during the winter. Moreover, these viruses are consistently mutating, and the most effective countermeasures are vaccination and distancing from the source of infection. Two primary modes of transmission of these viruses are direct contact and through minute droplets floating in the air. Distancing and isolation can prevent transmission through direct contact, whereas the infection through droplets requires special measures. Protein database biological assembly of (A) 1ruz, 1918 H1 hemagglutinin, and (B) 1WGC_1, wheat germ agglutinin. Image Credit: Kim, Y et al., Polymers Two types of enzymes are present on the surface of an influenza virus (80-120 nm) which bind to the sialic acid present on the cell surface of the human respiratory tract, namely, the antigenic projection-type hemagglutinin (HA), and the antigenic determinant type neuraminidase (NA). Among these, antigenic projection HA (13.5 nm) is a direct factor. About the Study In this study, researchers synthesized a polymer brush that can host specific sialic acids to imitate the sugar chain cluster effect, and that can react with WGA, and HA lectin substitute to simulate influenza virus adsorption in an aerosol form. The base of the polymer brush was a polypropylene (PP) MNWF, and the threads of the brush were synthesized using RIGP of glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) monomer. By regulating the amount of radiation and monomer concentration in RIGP, the length and density of the polymer brush were controlled. The average length of the polymer brush threads was 35 nm. GMA MNWF was synthesized using a GMA concentration of 3-8.5% and irradiation of 10~20 kGy. As the substitution of HA lectin, WGA was preferred over concanavalin A (ConA). Furthermore, two types of sialic acids were chosen, one was N-acetylneuraminic acid (NANA), and the other was a complex of disodium iminodiacetate monohydrate (IDA) and 1-(3-dimethyl aminopropyl)-3-ethyl carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC). NANA, IDA, and EDC had a concentration of 0.25, 0.125, and 0.25 mol, respectively. Finally, the WGA lectin absorbed by different MNWFs was segregated by 0.2 wt.% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) solution and treated with the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) followed by measuring using a spectrophotometer. Lectin aerosolization device. Image Credit: Kim, Y et al., Polymers Observations The highest density of IDA-EDC was about 8.4 mmol/g at 173% dg of GMA MNWF, indicating that the dg increased the GMA content (from here, MNWF means GMA grifted MNWF polymer brush). Moreover, the edges of the MNWF brush slightly curled when the dg of the IDA-EDC MNWF was 100% or less, whereas the edges of the polymer brush were severely bent when the dg of the IDA-EDC MNWF was more than 100%. The average molar conversion rate of IDA-EDC absorbed MNWF from empty MNWF was 47%. The fluorescence microscopy images revealed that empty MNWF exhibited non-selective adsorption of lectin. NANA MNWF demonstrated more WGA lectin absorption than the IDA-EDC MNWF. Also, a small amount of fluorescent material remained even after the lectin extraction from the NANA MNWF. The NANA MNWF with a dg of 87% absorbed 118.2 of 200 μg of aerosolized WGA lectin with a maximum adsorption amount was 59.1%. However, when the dg was 100% or more, the lectin absorption decreased below its previous value. Hence, NANA MNWF with a dg of 80-100% was the ideal range for maximum lectin absorption.

Image Credit: Kim, Y et al., Polymers Conclusions To conclude, the researchers of this study synthesized a polymer brush type absorbent to absorb the influenza virus from droplets floating in the air. The absorbent polymer brush was an MNWF that was synthesized through the RIGP of the GMA monomer. The prepared GMA MNWF polymer brush hosted specific sialic acids such as NANA and IDE-EDC complex to imitate the sugar chain cluster effect. The readily available WGA was used as the substitute for HA lectin that is found on the surface of the influenza virus. Both sialic acids absorbed WGA lectin, but NANA demonstrated higher absorption of WGA lectin than the IDE-EDC complex. Moreover, the maximum lectin absorption for NANA sialic acid was found to be dependent on the dg of the MNWF, i.e., in a range of 80-100%, which started to decrease when the dg exceeded above 100%. Hence, NANA sialic acid-containing GMA grafted MNWF polymer brush is a promising device to absorb influenza viruses from the infected droplets.

Gumilang Pramuwidyatama1,2*Dikky Indrawan3*Helmut W. Saatkamp1Henk Hogeveen1 1Business Economics Group, Wageningen University and Research, Wageningen, Netherlands 2School of Business and Management, Bandung Institute of Technology, Bandung, Indonesia 3School of Business, IPB University (Bogor Agricultural University), Bogor, Indonesia Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) H5N1 remains endemic in the Western Java smallholder broiler farms. This study aims to identify farmers and farm characteristics associated with farmers' motivations toward five different measures directed to HPAI: cleaning and disinfection (C&D), vaccination, reporting, and stamping-out with and without compensation. Through multi-stage sampling and a questionnaire, we collected data from 199 farmers in Western Java and applied descriptive analysis and logistic regression to evaluate the data. Most smallholder broiler farms had a production contract with a poultry company. Unexpectedly, we identified subtypes of price-contract (i.e., revenues based on contract selling price and live bird weight) and makloon-contract (i.e., revenues based on management fee per bird) schemes. We identified these new subtypes as extended price-contract and extended makloon-contract schemes. These extended subtypes included issues related to animal health management and payment schemes. The results show that most of the farmers in both extended types were highly motivated to implement C&D and vaccination. Business types and farmers' awareness of HPAI were significantly associated with a farmer's motivation to implement C&D. Farmers who had an awareness of HPAI were more likely to implement C&D. Although our models were insufficient to model the association of farmers' motivation to uptake preventive measures against HPAI in Western Java, this study identified significant characteristics that help improve HPAI control policy in Western Java. Our study suggests that farm business types and incentives through payment schemes and training may increase the uptake of preventive measures by farmers. Introduction Since the outbreak in 2004, HPAI has remained endemic in most of Indonesian regions. Efforts have been made to mitigate HPAI in Western Java, its control has not been completely successful. The broiler sector consists of a mix of industrialized, small-scale commercial, and backyard farms (1, 2), but the latter two account for more than 90% of the population and production (1). Due to the limited uptake of HPAI control measures by these types of broiler farmers (3), HPAI has become endemic in the region (4). Furthermore, there are markets for sick chickens in the traditional market chain, jeopardizing efforts to control HPAI in Western Java (1). Therefore, controlling HPAI at the farm level, particularly on small-scale commercial and backyard farms, is considered a priority strategy in the context of Western Java (5). The three most common types of smallholder broiler farmers in Western Java are (a) independent, (b) makloon-contract, and (c) price-contract farmers (6). Independent farmers buy production inputs and sell chickens themselves. Makloon-contract farmers are paid by a large poultry company based on the number of day-old chickens at the start of the production cycle. Price-contract farmers have a contract with a larger poultry company to get production inputs and technical assistance on a credit basis and to sell their chickens to them at a predetermined price. An analysis of determinants for smallholder broiler farmers' willingness to implement measures against HPAI in an endemic situation may inform the implementation of HPAI mitigation programs. To date, several studies have investigated the association between farmers' and farm characteristics and the uptake of preventive measures (7), biosecurity practices (6, 8), and vaccination programs (4). However, these studies focused on the uptake of measures aimed at disease prevention. For instance, Indrawan et al. (6) highlighted differences on overall farm biosecurity level and biosecurity infrastructures on different farm business types. In practice, a program usually comprises a set of different measures with different aims. This study compared factors that determine farmers' motivation to implement different measures aimed at prevention, monitoring, and control of HPAI. This way, the results of this study may be more informative for designing mitigation programs with a high adoption rate among farmers. While the previous study (3) specifically focused on associations between socio-psychological factors and farmers' motivation, this study aims to identify if and how farmer and farm characteristics are associated with smallholder broiler farmers' motivation to implement different measures against HPAI, such as cleaning and disinfection (C&D), vaccination, reporting, and stamping-out. Materials and Methods Since this study's materials and methods have been extensively presented in our published paper (3), a summary is presented in this section. Farm Level HPAI Mitigation Measures This study investigates farmers' motivation to implement different preventive, monitoring, and control measures directed against HPAI, i.e., cleaning and disinfection (a proxy measure for biosecurity), vaccination, reporting, and stamping-out (3). 1. Cleaning and disinfection (C&D) is defined as cleaning and disinfecting the barn once in every 2 days. 2. Vaccination is defined as farmers vaccinate their flock against AI on the seventh day in every production cycle. 3. Reporting is defined as reporting to the technical service or veterinarian as quickly as possible if farmers observe AI infection symptoms on one of their chickens. 4. Stamping-out is defined as the culling of an entire flock after the farm has been declared infected by an HPAI virus. Two schemes exist: either farmers are compensated (up to 50% of the total value) for the culled healthy broilers, or they are not. The latter was the case in the current study. Questionnaire Design The questionnaire used in this study was similar to a previously published version (3). The questionnaire comprised of two parts. The first part aimed to collect information about the farmer's sociodemographic characteristics, informational background, and farm business types. The second part aimed to collect information about intentions, attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control related to the four mitigation measures mentioned above. In the current analysis, only information on farmer intentions was included. In the first part on sociodemographic characteristics, parameters such as gender, age, education level, broiler farming contribution to farmers' income (i.e., the proportion of farmers' income received from broiler farming) were collected. The informational background of the farmers was also queried, through data on the poultry population, the farmer's broiler farming experience, and his/her knowledge about AI. To determine the farm's business type, farmers were asked whether they worked independently or had a production contract with an integrated company. Farmers with a production contract were subsequently asked whether they are paid based on the number of broilers on the farm (i.e., makloon-contract) or received payment based on total delivered weight (i.e., price-contract). We applied a checklist to identify parties responsible for providing production inputs, including day-old chicken (DOC), feed, veterinary drugs, vaccine, vitamin, and technical services (TS). Then we classified the checklist into farmers' autonomy, animal health management, production management, technical service assistance, financing, sales of chicken, production bonuses, and payment scheme. In the second part, a five-point Likert scale was applied to measure farmers' agreement/disagreement (1 = strongly disagree, 2 = disagree, 3 = neutral, 4 = agree, 5 = strongly agree) to multiple motivation statements. We defined motivations using Ajzen's TACT principle, which stands for target, action, context, and time. For example, “If HPAI (target) were to occur in the environment where my farm is located (context) within one year (time), I would clean and disinfect the barn every 2 days (action).” The questionnaire was written in English first, then translated to Bahasa Indonesia, and translated back to English for verification and publication. A pilot study with ten smallholder broiler farmers was done to test whether farmers could understand the statements. Afterward, some statements and terminologies were modified based on farmer input during the pilot study. Data Collection The survey aimed to interview smallholder broiler farmers or staff responsible for the operations of the farm. Data were collected in four districts: Bogor, Subang, Tasikmalaya, and Ciamis regencies between March-April 2018. These districts were selected based on several criteria: population of broiler chickens, endemic HPAI, different dominant farming business types, and operational and logistical factors. Profiles of survey locations have been described by Pramuwidyatama et al. (3). Stratified proportional (random) sampling was applied to have sufficient respondents from each business type. We also aimed to have 50 respondents from each regency. The stratification was based on personal communications with Indonesian poultry experts because there are no published data about the number of farms under different business types. Two survey teams, each consisting of four enumerators, visited each regency on the same day. The team spent 2 days in each regency. Each team visited different subdistricts and was assisted by local government officials. Once teams arrived at the location, enumerators went to visit different farms individually to interview farmers. Snowball sampling was also applied to reach additional respondents by asking farmers or by approaching people who live nearby the farms. In the end, we interviewed 223 farmers. Of those interviews, 20 were not finished because the farmer needed to leave during the interview. Four interviews with independent farmers were omitted from the analyses because the sample size was too small. Thus, 199 responses from price- and makloon-contract farmers were included in the analyses. The study is exempted from ethics approval from the Social Sciences Ethics Committee of Wageningen University and Research (WUR). However, the survey complies with data collection and management rules in WUR and the codes of ethics for research involving human participants in Indonesia. These codes require that participants are well-informed about the aims of the research and anonymity in collecting and analyzing data (9). Data Analysis First, the data were checked for errors and missing values. A descriptive analysis was applied to all variables used in this study. All the motivation variables' data turned out to be skewed, details are provided in Appendices 1, 2. Thus, logistic regression models were chosen to explain the associations between the characteristics and motivation (i.e., one model for each motivation). For all logistic regression models, farmers' motivations to implement each of the studied measures was used as dependent variables, and characteristics of farmers and farms were used as independent variables. Each of the farmers' motivations was grouped into two categories based on the Likert scores given (i.e., 1–3: low or 4–5: high-level motivations) (3). Independent variables, such as gender, age, farming experience, poultry population, and awareness of HPAI and its signs, were also categorized as binary variables. Education and dependency level on broiler farming variables were categorized based on the number of choices used in each variable. Univariable and multivariable logistic regressions were applied to analyze associations between dependent and independent variables. A Chi-square (χ2) test (or Fischer exact test when there were fewer than five responses in a cell) was applied to identify independent variables used in the logistic regression models. Independent variables with a P < 0.15 in either of the tests were included in the logistic regression models. A backward stepwise procedure was applied to all multivariable logistic regression analyses. Independent variables that were not significant (P > 0.05) were removed from the models one-by-one at each step. All the statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 25.0 (10). Results Contract Classification During the fieldwork, we found subtypes of the price- and makloon-contract business types (Table 1). These subtypes included contract extensions related to animal health management decisions in both business types. In addition, a different payment scheme was found in makloon-contract business type. TABLE 1 Table 1. Classification of different business types in broiler farming based on the roles of broiler farmers and nucleus companies on different production and animal health aspects. We found that farmers in the price-contract type are not entirely in control of their flock's health. Instead, nucleus companies also control animal health management decisions, such as vaccination programs and disease control. As a result, these farmers had a lower level of autonomy in flock's health management. Thus, we categorized this business type as the extended price-contract type. We also found that farmers in the makloon-contract type were allowed to make some adjustments to animal health management on their farms, instead of fully abiding management standards set by the nucleus company. In addition, the payment scheme of the makloon-contract business type was that the management fee paid to farmers per sold bird depends on the farm's performance instead of a fixed management fee based on the number of day-old-chicks. The higher the farm's performance in a production cycle, the higher makloon fee farmers will receive. Thus, these farmers had a higher level of autonomy in flock's health and production performance management. Based on this finding, we categorized this business type as the extended makloon-contract type. This added another two business types to the three original business types (i.e., independent, price-contract, and makloon-contract) previously described by Indrawan et al. (6). The differences are shown in Table 2. TABLE 2 Table 2. Descriptive statistics of farmer and farm characteristics, and farmers motivations for each business type. Descriptive Statistics Table 2 provides the descriptive statistics of business types, farmer characteristics, and farm characteristics based on interviews with smallholder broiler farmers. Of the 199 farmers interviewed and included in this study, 58 were extended price-contract farmers, and 141 were extended makloon- contract farmers. In contrast to our original expectations during sampling, we found more extended makloon-contract farmers in Bogor and Subang and no price-contract farmers in the Ciamis regency. Detailed results of the descriptive statistics are shown in Appendices 3, 4, respectively. The majority of both extended makloon- and extended price-contract farmers were highly motivated to implement cleaning and disinfection (makloon: 92%; price: 79%), reporting (makloon: 89%; price: 86%), and vaccination (makloon: 79%; price: 82%). The motivation to apply stamping-out measures was clearly lower, both in the absence of compensation (makloon: 57%; price:40%) or with 50% compensation (makloon: 67%; price: 66%). The large majority of smallholder broiler farmers were male. Most extended makloon-contract farmers were older than 45 years old, while most extended price-contract farmers were younger than 45. A higher proportion of the younger makloon farmers' had <10 years of farming experience, while the older group had a more or less a balance composition of farmers with shorter and longer farming experience. For price-contract farmers, most of the farmers had <10 years of farming experience in both age groups. On average, extended makloon-contract farmers had fewer than 3,000 birds on their farms, while extended price-contract farmers had more than 3,000 birds. There was also a marked difference in education level: extended makloon-contract farmers most often had elementary school education, while more extended price-contract farmers had education until senior high school. Both extended makloon- and price-contract farmers were highly dependent on their income from broiler farming; and had awareness of HPAI and its signs. Characteristics in Relation to Farmers' Motivations Table 3 shows characteristics included and significantly associated with farmer motivation in each of the models. Detailed results of the univariable and multivariable logistic models are shown in Appendices 5, 6, respectively. TABLE 3 Table 3. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression model results showing significant associations between farm(er) characteristics and each prevention, monitoring, or control measure against HPAI. The business type was significantly (P < 0.05) associated with farmers' motivations toward cleaning and disinfection and stamping-out without any compensation. Extended price-contract farmers were less motivated to clean and disinfect (odds ratio, OR 0.34) or to join stamping-out without any compensation (OR 0.48). Gender was significantly (P < 0.05) associated with farmers' motivation to join stamping-out without any compensation. Male farmers were more motivated than female farmers to join stamping-out in the absence of compensation. The size of the poultry population was significantly and positively associated with farmer motivation toward reporting (P < 0.05; OR 2.7) and stamping-out with 50% compensation (P < 0.01; OR 2.98). Being aware of HPAI and its signs was significantly and positively associated with the motivations to clean and disinfect (P < 0.05; OR 2.78) and to join stamping-out with (P < 0.05; OR 2.23) and without (P < 0.05; OR 2.26) 50% compensation. The only characteristic that was not significantly associated with the motivation to vaccinate, neither in the univariable nor multivariable model, was dependency level on broiler farming. Age and poultry farming experience were not included in any model based on the Chi-square or Fischer's exact test. Even though farmers' education and dependency level on broiler farming were included in the models toward vaccination, reporting, and stamping out with 50% compensation, these factors were not significantly associated with any of the motivations. Overall, all of the models had a relatively low R2 score of 0.133 or less. Discussion The aim of this study was to understand which farmer and farm characteristics are associated with farmer motivation to implement different HPAI control measures. We assessed motivation for cleaning and disinfection (C&D), vaccination, reporting, and stamping-out with and without 50% compensation. Factors Business Types The first major finding of the study was the identification of differences in price-contract and makloon-contract business types. We identified these new business types as “extended,” as animal health management decisions were different than their non-extended counterparts. Instead of animal health management decisions were taken solely by extended price-contract farmers as reported by Indrawan et al. (6), we found that these farmers were required to join an animal health program, for instance, a vaccination program, set by the nucleus company. Furthermore, in the case of the extended makloon-contract business type, farmers were allowed to make decisions regarding chicken health as long as the decision was consulted with the technical adviser of the nucleus company beforehand. We also identified differences in payment schemes compared to the makloon business type as reported by Indrawan et al. (6): the extended makloon-contract farmers were paid based on performance and the number of chickens sent to slaughterhouses. The observed differences in business types might be explained by the time of data collection of this study which was 2 years later than the data collection of Indrawan et al. (6). Since differences were associated with animal health management decisions and payment schemes, these differences could influence farmers' motivation to take up control measures. Therefore, we explicitly considered these differences during interviews with farmers and in this study's analysis and discussion. Motivation Our results show that farmers from both business types were more motivated to implement preventive measures (i.e., C&D and vaccination) compared to control measures (i.e., stamping-out with and without compensation), in line with local governmental priorities that prefer biosecurity and vaccination over stamping-out measures (11). Thus, it would be wise for policymakers to focus on preventive over control measures. Multivariable models for preventive measures only showed associations between farm(er) characteristics and farmer motivations to implement cleaning and disinfection. For smallholder broiler farmers, this motivation was associated with the type of business and with the farmer's awareness of HPAI and its signs. In contrast, none of the farm(er) characteristics were associated with the farmer's motivation to vaccinate their chickens, suggesting that socio-psychological factors, such as attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control, were better factors to model a farmer's motivation to implement AI vaccination (3). Extended makloon-contract farmers were more likely to be motivated to take up cleaning and disinfection than extended price-contract farmers. One possible explanation could be the different incentives offered in each business type. Financial incentives could increase farmers' willingness to adopt preventive measures (3, 5, 12). In the extended makloon-contract business type, farmers have two types of incentives: the makloon fee and a performance bonus. Furthermore, expenses for all production inputs are covered by the company in makloon business types. Farmers are expected to manage the production cycle according to the standards set by the nucleus company. In contrast, the extended price-contract business type only offers farmers a performance bonus, and farmers need to pay for all production inputs. They would most probably be more willing to clean and disinfect their barn if it would affect their income. Awareness of HPAI Farmer awareness of HPAI and its clinical symptoms was significantly and positively associated with the motivation to clean and disinfect their barn. A majority of farmers from both business types were aware of HPAI and its signs. Ongoing communication, education and training can help to maintain farmer awareness (13). Information exchange about HPAI and related measures increased farm biosecurity uptake among Cambodian poultry farmers for the duration of the education program (14). In both business types, technical advisers have been suggested as proper communicators for farmers (3, 13). Policy Implications The extended makloon-contract business types is promising for increasing the uptake of HPAI preventive measures within smallholder broiler farms, as this business type offers financial incentives: higher makloon fees and bonuses for farmers who perform above the standard. Furthermore, both vaccination and biosecurity standards and practices might have a higher likelihood of being uniformly implemented and enforced to all farmers at a lower cost in the extended makloon-contract business type since, in this business type, nucleus companies require farmers to abide their production standards and they are able to buy production inputs in a large quantity at a lower price than farmers. As a policymaker and regulator, the government could facilitate a push strategy that provides incentives to increase all stakeholders' participation in HPAI control (5). Our study findings suggest that the government could apply different push strategies for different business types. For (extended) price-contract business type, the government needs to aim its policies at farmers directly. On the other hand, for (extended) makloon-contract business type, the government needs to target nucleus companies and their technical advisors. In practice, this means that local governments should identify the dominant business type in their district and adjust their strategy accordingly. Incentives from the government can be directed to complement existing incentives offered by nucleus companies. They could include, for instance, access to subsidized vaccines and the provision of trained vaccinators. The push strategy can be implemented through public-private partnership (PPP) and communication, information, and education programs (15). Limitations Our study has several limitations, similar to what has been explained in our previous study, such as the inadequacy of the number of respondents from extended price-contract farmers; unavailability of disease or outbreak status of farms; and a general understanding of the factors that determine farmers' motivations (3). The finding that business type influences farmer motivation to uptake measures suggests that research design should consider characteristics of different business types, as not only this study shows, but other studies as well [e.g., (6, 16)]. The influence of the different business types might partly explain the low R-squared of models in this study, and socio-psychological factors were better factors to explain farmers motivation toward different HPAI preventive measures (3). However, we found some significant characteristics with p-value lower than 5 and 1% to improve HPAI policy in Western Java. Still, having five different measures in one study allowed us to identify similarities and differences in factors that influence farmer motivation for different measures. Conclusions To conclude, smallholder broiler farmers are more motivated to implement preventive measures compared to control measures. The business type and farmers' awareness of HPAI were found to be associated with the farmer's motivation to clean and disinfect their barn. A push intervention, incentives, and communications between stakeholders were suggested to increase adoption and continued implementation of preventive measures. Further research is needed to evaluate farmers' willingness to join a contract type with different incentive schemes and animal health management programs.

Successful Farming's Editorial Guidelines Published on February 16, 2022 Close A commercial turkey flock in Webster County, Kentucky, has reported that the birds did carry avian influenza. The flock had been awaiting test results after a non-negative result was returned on Monday. READ MORE: Additional case of avian influenza detected in Indiana The site, which is now the center of a 10-kilometer (or slightly over 6-mile) surveillance zone, has completed the depopulation of the turkeys. Numbers for this depopulation have not been released. This is the second case of avian influenza in the state. The first case resulted in the depopulation of 240,000 chickens from a flock owned by Tyson. Though not a top-ranking state for turkey production, Kentucky ranks No. 15 for poultry and egg sales. Other operations inside the zone have been notified and are employing additional restrictions. For the next 30 days, the state veterinarian strongly recommends that producers in the zone who have birds with outdoor access keep birds indoors to prevent flocks from encountering wild fowl. State officials also recommend poultry have restricted access to sources of water that might be shared with wild birds. It is also recommended that operations implement strict biosecurity measures, especially in relation to waterfowl, and monitor flocks for increased mortality and clinical signs. "This is a highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza that affects poultry," says Katie Flynn, Kentucky State Veterinarian. "It's highly contagious and spreads very easily. It is deadly to birds, so it's important to identify birds that are sick early so we can contain the virus." Signs of avian influenza include birds dying without clinical signs; lack of energy; decreased egg production; soft-shelled or misshapen eggs; swelling or purple discoloration of the head, eyelids, comb, hocks; nasal discharge; coughing; sneezing; incoordination; and diarrhea. The USDA has a resource with images to help identify discoloration and other clinical signs. If a bird is suspected to have avian influenza, producers should contact their local veterinarian or contact state or federal officials. Producers can report sick or dead farm birds toll-free to the USDA at 866-536-7593. Was this page helpful? Thanks for your feedback! Tell us why!

LOUISVILLE GAS PRICESStay updated on the best prices in town WEATHER ALERTView full list of weather alerts Free-range chicken (Getty Images) Deadly avian flu found in Kentucky flock By Deborah Harbsmeier Kentucky PUBLISHED 2:04 PM ET Feb. 14, 2022 PUBLISHED 2:04 PM EST Feb. 14, 2022 SHARE FRANKFORT, Ky. â Avian flu has been found in a flock of commercial broiler chickens in Kentucky near the Tennessee border. What You Need To Know Avian flu found in a flock of broiler chickens It is deadly to birds, but doesn't pose a threat to poultry or eggs if they are properly cooked Indiana reported an infected flock last week Because Kentucky's infection was found so close to the Tennessee border, both states are investigating Kentucky State Veterinarian Dr. Katie Flynn says the United States Department of Agricultureâs (USDA) ANimal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) confirmed the strain which has the potential to kill many birds. They found the confirmed case of H5N1 avian influenza in Fulton County. The state is waiting on lab confirmation of another suspected case in Webster County. âThe Kentucky Department of Agriculture is working closely with animal health officials at both the federal and state government to contain these incidents of avian influenza,â Agriculture Commissioner Ryan Quarles said in a statement. âProtecting the health of livestock and poultry in the commonwealth is a top priority of the Kentucky Department of Agriculture. We encourage everyone to visit kyagr.com/HPAI for additional information and updates as they come.â On Feb. 11, a commercial chicken operation in Fulton County told the Kentucky Department of Agriculture about an increase in poultry deaths. Lab testing the Breathitt Veterinary Center and the USDAâs National Veterinary Services Laboratory confirmed highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) âWe are working diligently to prevent this virus from spreading to other poultry premises,â Dr. Flynn said. âWe have activated our Avian Influenza response plan and are in active communication with state, federal, and industry partners.â Avian influenza does not pose a food safety risk; poultry and eggs are safe to eat when handled and cooked properly. There is also no risk to the food supply, but the statement from the state says birds from the infected flocks will not enter the food system. They also stress they have found no human cases of avian influenza viruses in the United States. The affected operations have been quarantined. Federal and state agencies are working on additional testing in the area and surveillance to gather more information. The surveillance zone in Fulton County dips into Obion County in Tennessee due to Fulton Countyâs location on the border of the state line. The Tennessee Department of Agriculture (TDA) is coordinating with the Kentucky Department of Agriculture on the incident response. âItâs critical that we work together to prevent the spread of this virus,â Tennessee State Veterinarian Dr. Samantha Beaty said. âWe will begin testing and surveillance of commercial and backyard flocks within the surveillance zone immediately. In Tennessee, poultry owners should report unexpected deaths to the State Vetâs office.â Last week, Indiana reported a case of HPAI in a commercial turkey flock in Dubois County. It was the first case found in a commercial flock in the United States since 2020. The USDA also announced it has found the virus in a backyard flock of mixed species birds in Fauquier County, Virginia. Low pathogenic avian influenza was last identified in commercial flocks in Kentucky in 2017. Regardless if you have a small backyard poultry operation or are a large commercial producer, you should review the biosecurity activities to make sure the birds are healthy. APHIS has information to help poultry producers with biosecurity and other measures at Defend The Flock program. According to the Kentucky Department of Agriculture, Kentuckyâs poultry industry ranks seventh in the nation for broiler production. In 2020, Kentuckyâs production of boilers and eggs brought in an economic impact of $856 million.

Author disclosure: No relevant financial relationships. Key Points for Practice• Vaccination against hepatitis B is recommended for all adults up to 59 years of age.• The 15- and 20-valent PCVs are recommended for all adults 65 years and older and younger adults with risk factors. Those who receive the 15-valent vaccine should also receive the 23-valent PPSV.• In addition to adults older than 50 years, recombinant zoster immunization is recommended for people 19 years and older with immunosuppression.From the AFP Editors The 2022 adult and child/adolescent immunization schedules have been approved by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and are accessible at https://www.aafp.org/family-physician/patient-care/prevention-wellness/immunizations-vaccines.html. These schedules now combine links to COVID-19 vaccination information, Vaccination Information Statements, adverse event reporting, and a QR code for online schedules. Notable changes to the child/adolescent schedule include the addition of dengue vaccine recommendations, whereas the adult schedule has been updated with the 15-and 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV15, PCV20) in place of the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13), recombinant zoster vaccine recommendations for immunocompromised adults, and changes to hepatitis B recommendations. Changes to Both the Child/Adolescent and Adult Immunization Schedules INFLUENZA VACCINATION Routine annual influenza vaccination continues to be recommended for all people six months or older without contraindications. Although late October remains the target for universal vaccination, it should continue to be offered while influenza viruses are circulating locally and unexpired vaccine is available. The 2021–2022 influenza season coincides with continued circulation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Influenza vaccination reduces symptoms that might be confused with those of COVID-19 while reducing outpatient visits, hospitalizations, and intensive care unit admissions and mitigating stress on the U.S. health care system. There are six types of vaccines with nine brand names available for administration. All seasonal influenza vaccines available in the United States for the 2021–2022 season are quadrivalent with updates to the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza A(H3N2) components. U.S.-licensed influenza vaccines will contain hemagglutinin derived from an influenza A/Victoria/2570/2019 (H1N1) pdm09-like virus (for egg-based vaccines) or an influenza A/Wisconsin/588/2019 (H1N1) pdm09-like virus (for cell culture–based and recombinant vaccines), an influenza A/Cambodia/e082 6360/2020 (H3N2)-like virus, an influenza B/Washington/02/2019 (Victoria lineage)-like virus, and an influenza B/Phuket/3073/2013 (Yamagata lineage)-like virus. The minimum age for the cell culture–based inactivated influenza vaccine (Flucelvax Quadrivalent) has been adjusted from four to two years of age. Influenza vaccines can be coadministered with other vaccines, including COVID-19 vaccines, with the vaccines given in separate anatomic sites. ACIP guidance concerning coadministration of other vaccines with influenza vaccines is available at: https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pdf/professionals/acip/acip-2021-22-summary-of-recommendations-updated.pdf. People with egg allergy should receive the recombinant influenza vaccine (Flublok Quadrivalent) or the cell culture–based inactivated influenza vaccine, which do not contain egg components. If egg-based influenza vaccines need to be administered, they should be given in a medical setting under supervision of a health care professional who can recognize and manage severe allergic reactions. Changes to the Child/Adolescent Immunization Schedule COVID-19 VACCINATION A booster dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine is recommended five months after completing the initial two-dose series for children 12 to 17 years of age. Unvaccinated children in this age group are hospitalized six times as often as those who received the two-dose series.1 The risk of myocarditis for children younger than 16 years is 37 times higher for those infected with COVID-19 than those uninfected.2 In Israel, where 6% of children 12 to 15 years of age received a booster dose five months after the initial vaccine series, children without the booster were infected 17 times as often as those who received the booster. Two cases of myocarditis were diagnosed after the booster dose in more than 40,000 Israeli children who received the booster. DENGUE VACCINATION Recurrent dengue virus infections can be deadly when the second infection involves a different virus strain. For people nine to 16 years of age who live in an area where dengue virus is endemic and have laboratory confirmation of a previous dengue virus infection, ACIP recommends three doses of Dengvaxia administered six months apart. Changes to the Adult Immunization Schedule HEPATITIS B VACCINATIONS Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection carries up to a 25% risk of premature death from cirrhosis or liver cancer. The CDC Division of Viral Hepatitis announced a goal of reducing HBV infections by 90% and HBV-related deaths by 65% by 2030, and the Department of Health and Human Services announced earlier this year a goal to eliminate viral hepatitis as a public health threat in the U.S. by 2030. Universal vaccination of adults is a key element of this goal. ACIP recommends that the HBV vaccine be administered to all adults through 59 years of age, and to adults 60 years and older who have any risk factor for HBV infection. Adults 60 years and older without risk factors for HBV infection may receive the vaccine if they choose. Childhood vaccination against hepatitis B is on a path to eliminate acute HBV infection for U.S. adults younger than 29 years. In contrast, the previous risk-based HBV vaccination strategy among adults has been less successful, with nearly 2 million Americans living with chronic HBV infection. PNEUMOCOCCAL VACCINATION ACIP now recommends that all adults 65 years and older and adults 19 to 64 years of age with certain risk factors (Table 1) who have not previously received a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) or whose vaccination history is unknown receive one dose of PCV15 or PCV20. When PCV15 is used, it should be followed by a dose of pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) typically more than one year later; a minimum of eight weeks later for those at high risk.3 AlcoholismCerebrospinal fluid leakChronic heart diseaseChronic kidney disease or nephrotic syndromeChronic liver diseaseChronic lung diseaseCigarette smokingCochlear implantCongenital or acquired aspleniaDiabetes mellitusGeneralized malignancyHIVHodgkin diseaseImmunodeficiency or iatrogenic immunosuppressionLeukemia, lymphoma, or multiple myelomaSickle cell disease or other hemoglobinopathiesSolid organ transplant recipient RECOMBINANT ZOSTER VACCINATION ACIP now recommends two doses of recombinant zoster vaccine for the prevention of herpes zoster and its complications in people 19 years and older who are or will be immunodeficient or immunosuppressed because of disease or therapy, in addition to adults 50 years and older. ORTHOPOXVIRUS VACCINATION ACIP now recommends the Jynneos vaccine as an alternative to the ACAM2000 vaccine for the primary series and for booster doses in people 18 years and older at risk of monkeypox or smallpox because of occupational exposure. ACAM2000 is a live, replicating vaccinia virus vaccine that can cause significant adverse effects. As a live, nonreplicating vaccine, Jynneos causes fewer adverse effects. EBOLA VACCINATION ACIP expanded the recommendation for pre-exposure vaccination with Ervebo, a genetically engineered live, attenuated vaccine against the Zaire Ebola virus, to include health care personnel at special pathogen treatment centers who are involved in the transport and treatment of patients with suspected or confirmed Ebola and laboratory or support staff at Laboratory Research Network facilities who may handle Ebola virus specimens. Vaccination continues to be recommended for individuals responding to Ebola outbreaks, health care personnel stationed at federally designated Ebola treatment centers, and laboratory workers at level 4 biosafety facilities. RABIES VACCINATION ACIP recommends a two-dose intramuscular pre-exposure rabies vaccine series, with doses separated by seven days, be offered to immunocompetent people 18 years and older at elevated risk of rabies exposure. As an alternative to rabies antibody titers, an intramuscular booster dose of rabies vaccine is recommended between 21 days and three years after the initial series for those with sustained elevated risk of rabies exposure.

Ⓒ 2024 Dotdash Media, Inc. — All rights reserved Cold & Flu Prevention Is the Flu Shot a Live Virus? What to Know About the Flu Shot Only the nasal spray vaccine contains a live virus, not the flu shot By Kelly Burch Updated on February 18, 2022 Medically reviewed by Anju Goel, MD Print Table of Contents View All Table of Contents History of Flu Shot Common Myths Ingredients Side Effects Effectiveness Frequently Asked Questions Close The flu shot reduces your risk of contracting influenza, a virus that is common in the winter and causes coughing, aches, and fever. The flu vaccine can stop you from getting seriously ill or dying. Because of this, it’s recommended annually for all Americans who are 6 months or older. Despite the prevalence of the flu shot, many people have unanswered questions about the flu vaccine, including: Is the flu shot a live virus? How effective is the flu vaccine? What are the flu vaccine side effects? There is only one type of flu vaccine—the vaccine administered as a nasal spray—that contains a live virus. That virus is attenuated (weakened) and cannot cause illness. This article will explain the live flu vaccine and answer common questions about the vaccine. Cell-based flu vaccines are effective in children as young as two, according to new data. History of the Flu Shot The flu vaccine has been used for more than 80 years. Here’s an overview of its use over time: 1940s: The flu shot is developed in 1940. Initially, it was only for army use, but by 1945, it was approved for civilians. 1960s: In 1960, the U.S. surgeon general recommends that all people with chronic diseases, people over the age of 65, or people who are pregnant get an annual flu vaccine. This was in response to a 1957 flu pandemic that killed 116,000 Americans. 1970s: Another flu outbreak leads to widespread vaccination, with about 25% of Americans getting the vaccine. 1990s: Federal programs, including Medicare, begin covering the vaccine, resulting in more use. 2002: The vaccine is recommended for babies ages 6–23 months.2003: The nasal spray flu vaccine is approved. 2012: The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a quadrivalent vaccine, which combines protection against four flu strains.2024: Flu vaccines now include only three strains, because one of the influenza B viruses that was previously included appears to no longer be actively circulating. In the 1990s, the use of the vaccine became more widespread, in part because of federal programs that paid for vaccination. Understanding Flu Vaccine Effectiveness Common Myths About the Flu Shot Although the flu vaccine has been used for decades in millions of Americans, there are many misconceptions. Here are the answers to common questions about the flu vaccine. Is the Flu Shot a Live Virus? There is only one type of flu vaccine that contains a live virus: the nasal spray vaccine, sold under the name FluMist. This vaccine contains live viruses, but they have been weakened and cannot cause illness. The nasal spray flu vaccine is approved for people ages 2-49. It cannot be given to pregnant people or those with compromised immune systems. Flu shots do not contain a live virus. The shots are made either with a virus that has been killed or with a single protein of the virus. Can the Flu Shot Get You Sick? No, the flu shot cannot cause you to get the flu. If you experience the flu after getting your vaccine, you were likely exposed before getting your shot. It takes about two weeks after getting the vaccine to be fully protected, so you can still contract the flu during that time. Although the flu shot can’t make you sick with influenza, it can lead to side effects. These are usually mild and include soreness at the infection site, aches, fever and feeling tired. In most cases these resolve within a day. Can You Get the Flu From a Flu Shot? Do You Need a Flu Shot Every Year? Yes, you should get the flu shot every year. The vaccine becomes less effective with time. In addition, the formulation of the flu vaccine is customized each year against the strains of the flu that are expected to be more common during that flu season. Is the Flu Shot Effective? When the viruses in the flu vaccine match the viruses that are circulating, the flu vaccine reduces your chance of catching the flu by 40%–60%. However, scientists can’t always predict what strains of flu will be most active, so sometimes the vaccine is less effective than that. However, the vaccine is very effective at preventing hospitalization and death, as follows: Vaccinated people who get the flu are 26% less likely to enter a hospital’s intensive care unit (ICU) for people who are very ill than unvaccinated people. Vaccinated people are 31% less likely to die from flu than unvaccinated people. Among people hospitalized for flu, vaccinated people are 59% less likely to enter the ICU. A Universal Flu Vaccine Is in the Works, and Could Replace Your Annual Flu Shot Flu Shot Ingredients Flu vaccines contain ingredients that provide immunity and keep the vaccine safe during manufacturing. The exact ingredients vary based on the vaccine you get, but in general, vaccines contain: Portions of the virus that you are being protected against, to elicit an immune responsePreservatives and antibiotics, to keep the vaccine from being contaminated during manufacturingAdjuvants, materials like aluminum, that help your body give a stronger immune responseStabilizers, like sugar or gelatin, to keep the vaccine effectiveCell culture materials, like egg protein, that the virus has been cultured in (There are now egg-free vaccines available for people with severe egg allergies.)Inactivating ingredients, which kill the virus (Formaldehyde is often used, but in such small concentrations that it is not harmful.) It’s important to remember that these ingredients are carefully screened for safety, and they are not linked with any ill health effects. If you have questions about vaccine ingredients, talk with your healthcare provider or pharmacist. Flu Shot Side Effects The flu shot can’t make you sick, but it might make you feel under the weather for a day. Common side effects of the flu vaccine include: Soreness, aches, and headacheFeverTiredness If you get the nasal spray vaccine, you might also experience a runny nose, sore throat or cough. These side effects are caused by your body mounting an immune response. They’re usually mild and resolve within a day. Flu Shot Side Effects Importance of Getting a Flu Shot Although we’re all used to living with the flu, it has serious health implications. Getting the vaccine is a way to keep you and those around you healthy. Here’s why: It reduces risk of infection: The flu vaccine reduces your risk of infection by up to 60%. That can help stop the spread to those you love and anyone you encounter.It reduces severity of illness: If you do contract the flu, you’re less likely to need hospitalization. If you end up in the hospital, you’re less likely to need intensive care.It can prevent complications from chronic health problems: People with heart disease are less likely to have a cardiac event when they’re vaccinated. Being vaccinated is also associated with fewer complications from diabetes and chronic lung disease.It helps protect you during pregnancy: Getting vaccinated reduces the risk of a pregnant person being hospitalized for flu by 40%. The vaccine can also offer protection to the baby during the first few months of life, when a child is not yet eligible for vaccination. Understanding Flu Vaccine Effectiveness Summary Most flu vaccines do not contain a live virus. Only the nasal spray contains a live virus, and it has been weakened and cannot cause infection or illness. Getting the flu vaccine cannot cause you to get influenza. However, it can protect you from contracting the flu and getting seriously sick with it. A Word From Verywell There’s a lot of misinformation floating around about vaccines. That can make it scary to get vaccinated, especially if you’ve already had the flu and recovered. However, the flu causes tens of thousands of hospitalizations and deaths in America each year. The vaccine is the best way to protect yourself and those around you. If you have concerns about the flu shot or flu vaccine ingredients, speak with your healthcare provider or pharmacist, and have them answer your question. Frequently Asked Questions What is the nasal flu vaccine? The nasal flu vaccine is a vaccine administered as a nasal spray. It’s approved for people ages 2–49. It’s the only type of flu vaccine that contains a live virus, but the virus has been weakened so that it can’t cause illness. Still, the nasal flu vaccine can cause additional side effects including sore throat and runny nose. When did the flu shot stop using a live virus? The flu shot has never contained a live virus. How effective is the flu shot? The flu vaccine is about 60% effective when there’s a good match between the viruses covered by the vaccine and those circulating. However, there’s not always a good match, so effectiveness has varied from 19 to 52% since 2012. Is the flu shot safe to get? Yes, the flu shot is safe to get. It can reduce your risk of serious illness, and most side effects are mild. 6 Sources Verywell Health uses only high-quality sources, including peer-reviewed studies, to support the facts within our articles.

Chickens in one barn among a flock of 240,000 birds belonging to Tyson Foods have become infected with a lethal form of bird flu, the company confirmed.The discovery intensifies an ongoing outbreak of bird flu in the U.S. that involves poultry operations in Kentucky and Virginia, and follows the destruction of 29,000 turkeys in Indiana.The discovery of the H1N1 strain of highly infectious pathogenic avian influenza, or HPAI, last week in Dubois County, Indiana, was the first detection of the virus in commercial poultry in the United States since 2020, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) said.

Although the origin of the infection is not known, avian influenza has been found in migratory wild birds, which play a significant role in spreading the disease."We are "prepared for situations like this, and we have robust plans in place, which we are now executing," it added, including "heightening biosecurity measures at other farms in the region, placing additional restrictions on outside visitors, and continuing our practice of testing all flocks for avian influenza before birds leave the farms."The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said according to the World Health Organization (WHO) over 700 cases of bird flu in humans have been recorded globally since November 2003.The CDC says that though bird flu can cross species and infect humans, this cross-transmission is rare. Infection usually occurs as a result of infected birds shedding avian virus in their saliva, mucous, and feces which then gets into a person's eyes, nose, or mouth, or is inhaled.The CDC adds that this can happen when the virus is in the air in droplets or even possibly dust and a person breathes it in, or when a person touches something that has the virus on it then touches their mouth, eyes, or nose.Cross infection also usually occurs when a person has unprotected contact with infected birds or surfaces contaminated with avian influenza viruses. But, the CDC reports some infections have been identified where direct contact was not known to have occurred.When a person is infected with avian flu the resultant illness ranges from mild to severe.In January, Newsweek reported on a rare case of avian flu crossing over to a human in the United Kingdom. The U.K. Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said at the time that the person in question, who lived in southwest England, had been in close contact with infected birds and there was no evidence of onward transmission.In addition to avoiding unprotected close contact with birds, the USDA advises that to further offset the risk of cross-transmission of avian flu to humans, poultry and eggs should be cooked to an internal of 165F to kill bacteria and viruses.What Other Risks Does an Avian Flu Outbreak Present?These infections are concerning for non-health-related reasons, however, especially if more poultry operations in the country are found to be affected.According to the USDA, the U.S. is the world's top producer of poultry, and number two in terms of exports, following the top exporter Brazil.The U.S. was forecast to export 3.4 million tons of chicken meat in 2022, of total global export of 13.4 million tons. The growth in U.S. chicken meat export is partially due to the downturn in exports of chicken meat from the European Union which was caused by avian flu.

The site currently lists three cases in commercial birds during the current outbreak. This includes commercial turkeys, a mixed-species backyard flock in Fauquier County, Virginia, and the broiler chicken flock in Fulton County, Kentucky, belonging to Tyson foods.Correction 02/17/22, 4:46 a.m. ET: This article and its headline were updated to clarify a barn of chickens among a flock of 240,000 birds was infected with bird flu.

Some scientists think so. News By Nicoletta Lanese published 16 February 2022 The idea is very "speculative," some say.

(Image credit: Shutterstock) In 1889, a mysterious respiratory illness emerged in Russia and then spread across the globe, triggering at least three waves of infection over the course of several years. Now, some scientists suspect that this illness, dubbed the "Russian flu," actually may have been caused by a pandemic coronavirus similar to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, The New York Times reported.There are some easily drawn parallels between the two pandemics. For instance, during the Russian flu pandemic, schools and workplaces closed due to the sheer number of people infected. Those infected often lost their senses of taste and smell, and some endured long-lasting symptoms that lingered for months. In general, the Russian flu seemed to kill far more elderly people than children, unlike influenza viruses, which tend to be similarly fatal to both age groups, according to the available historical records, which include government health records, newspapers and journal articles. While these features of the Russian flu pandemic eerily resemble those of the current pandemic, the idea that the Russian flu might have been caused by a coronavirus remains speculative, Peter Palese, a flu researcher and professor of medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, told The New York Times. Some experts echoed this sentiment, but others said they suspect that although there may be hard evidence to support the idea, it just hasn't been found yet.Related: 14 coronavirus myths busted by science Dr. Jeffery Taubenberger, chief of the viral pathogenesis and evolution section at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and John Oxford, emeritus professor of virology at Queen Mary, University of London, are on the hunt for such evidence. They've been digging through preserved lung tissue samples that predate the 1918 flu pandemic, looking for remnants of influenza viruses and coronaviruses. Among these tissues, they hope to spot the elusive Russian flu virus. RELATED CONTENT—11 (sometimes) deadly diseases that hopped across species—20 of the worst epidemics and pandemics in history—The deadliest viruses in history Dr. Scott Podolsky, a professor of global health and social medicine at Harvard Medical School, and Dominic W. Hall, the curator of the Warren Anatomical Museum at Harvard, are also looking for preserved lung tissue from the same time period, the Times reported. If genetic material from the Russian flu virus turns up in these lungs, it may offer hints as to how the pandemic ended, as news coverage from the time offers little insight. And if the late-19th-century pandemic was caused by a coronavirus, some scientists think that the bug may still be circulating as one of the four coronaviruses that cause the common cold, rather than severe disease.

According to figures from the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), shared exclusively with The Telegraph, a record-breaking 14 million avian influenza cases were detected in 2021 – more than in the previous five years combined. In total 61.4 million birds died either from the virus or because they were culled to halt its spread.This represents a 462 per cent rise in cases and a 150 per cent surge in deaths compared to 2020, and follows a bumpy but general trend of increasing infections since records began in 2005 (see chart below). Scientists say the skyrocketing incidence of avian influenza – which does not appear to be a consequence of better detection systems – could spell trouble for human health, by generating billions more opportunities for the pathogen to jump to and circulate in people. Since 2005, there have been roughly 2,500 human infections. “An increase in poultry outbreaks inevitably brings the virus into closer and more frequent proximity to humans, which is always a risk with viruses like influenza that can rapidly evolve,” Dr Holly Shelton, head of the Influenza Viruses Group at The Pirbright Institute, told The Telegraph. “[This] is a risk that needs to be mitigated against.” 1103 Bird Flu - Record Breaking Numbers Dr John McCauley, director of the Worldwide Influenza Centre at the Francis Crick Institute, added: “The most important question is… [whether] more cases [means] it is more likely to infect humans. The answer must be yes.”Between 2005 and 2009, there were 2.6 million bird flu infections reported to the OIE. This rose to 5 million between 2010 and 2015, and 11.9 million in the subsequent five years – but in 2020 and 2021 alone, more than 16.5m infections were reported across the globe (see chart below). The UK is among those facing record-breaking epidemics, with George Eustice, the environment minister, warning in December that the country was in the midst of its “largest ever outbreak”. At least half a million birds have been culled as a result. But while experts are concerned that the risk of a spillover event is escalating, they stress that cases of bird flu jumping to people currently remain rare and are generally confined to those who work in close contact with poultry. Between 2005 and 2020, when a total of 246 million birds were culled, fewer than 2,500 human cases of various flu subtypes were recorded, and there is not yet any evidence of human-to-human transmission, said the OIE. Bird Flu - Surge in Numbers However, last month a duck expert, Alan Gosling, was identified as the first person in the UK to be infected with the deadly H5NI bird flu strain. Meanwhile, four new cases of H5N6 have been detected in China this year – while 67 cases of this subtype have been identified in people since 2014, more than half of all human infections were in the last six months.Scientists agree that although detection systems have improved, especially in lower income countries, the scale of the rise in cases in birds means it is unlikely to reflect better surveillance – especially in poultry, where disease has always been closely tracked. But it is not clear what has driven the surge – a more transmissible strain, shifting migration patterns, climate change or an unexpected “influenza epizootic” have all been discussed.“I think we are doing better with surveillance but in reality that will only translate into increased observations in wild birds and would not account for the increase in poultry, so… I think this is a real rise in infections, both in poultry and wild birds,” said Dr Shelton.“There are genetic changes from the H5N8 virus that was predominant in the 2020/2021 season in Europe, whether this translates into the virus is more transmissible in birds has not been experimentally tested,” she added.“However the number of outbreaks does seem to suggest that either there are higher levels of infection in wild bird populations or that it transmits to poultry more easily… and has been no evidence of human-to-human spread or genetic signatures in the viruses that suggest human adaptation”. Bird flu Dr McCauley also said that “viruses change and ‘fitter’ viruses will spread better until the population builds up immunity”. He added that while avian influenza can spread like wildfire through a battery farm, free-roaming poultry may have more contact with infected wild birds. There is a consensus, however, that stemming the transmission of bird flu, introducing strict infection control measures and maintaining widespread surveillance networks will be key to mitigate the risk of new spillover events. “Controlling the disease in the animal source is critical to decrease risk to humans,” said Tarik Jasarevic, a WHO spokesperson. “Ongoing circulation of some avian influenza viruses in poultry, such as A(H5) viruses, are of public health concern.“These viruses can infect humans and the viruses have the potential to mutate to increase transmissibility among humans resulting in an influenza pandemic. “To minimise public health risk, quality surveillance in both animal and human populations, thorough investigation of every human infection with a zoonotic virus and risk-based pandemic planning are essential,” he said.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Advertisement More stories More from Global Health Security Teenager hospitalised with bird flu Iraq to lower the ‘age of consent’ for girls to nine New case of dangerous mpox strain brings UK total to four ‘Go wild, Robert’: what Trump’s victory means for global health Death by stigma: The HIV patients in Malawi refusing life-saving medication What is mpox?

Researchers in Beijing have announced the development of a novel assessment tool, the Flu-IV Score, which predicts the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) in patients with influenza-related pneumonia (Flu-P) within 14 days of admission. The results of their multicenter study, conducted in in 5 tertiary hospitals in China, was recently published in BMC Pulmonary Medicine. In the current study, 1107 patients with confirmed Flu-P were enrolled retrospectively from January 2012 to December 2019, including 895 patients in a derivation group and 212 patients in a validation group. Enrolled patients had a median age of 61 years and were 54.5% (603/1107) male. The most common comorbidities were cardiovascular disease (22.7%; 251/1107), diabetes mellitus (13.4%; 148/1107), and cerebrovascular disease (10.3%; 114/1107). The predictive model was based on independent risk factors for IMV in the patients in the derivation cohort. Participants in the derivation cohort were divided into 2 groups based on whether they had undergone IMV within 14 days after admission. The researchers compared baseline characteristics between these 2 patient groups. The investigators incorporated all variables that produced a P <.1 in the first univariable analyses into a multivariable, backward stepwise logistic regression model to identify the risk factors related to 14-day IMV rates (which included age ≥65 years, influenza A virus infection, existence of solid malignant tumors, respiratory rate ≥30 breaths per minute, leukocyte count >10 × 109/L, leukocytes <0.8 × 109/L, albumin <35 g/L, arterial pH <7.35, ratio of partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood to inspired oxygen fraction [PaO2/FiO2] <300 mmHg, early neuraminidase inhibitor [NAI] therapy, and systemic corticosteroids use at admission). A total of 10.6% (117/1107) of participants required IMV within 14 days of admission. The authors used a cumulative score of 5 points to identify patients at risk of IMV. Multivariate regression analyses showed that the most common factors associated with IMV included early NAI use (odds ratio [OR] 0.014; 95% CI, 0.003-0.083; P <.001; -3 points), lymphocytes <0.8 × 109/L (OR 5.755; 95% CI, 2.261-14.649; P <.001; 1 point), multilobar infiltrates (OR 4.568; 95% CI, 1.591-13.118; P =.007; 1 point), systemic corticosteroid use (OR 5.874; 95% CI, 2.356-14.642; P <.001; 1 point), age ≥ 65 years (OR 9.052; 95% CI, 3.544-23.119; P <.001; 1 point), PaO2/FiO2 <300 mmHg (OR 9.966; 95% CI, 3.619-27.447; P <.001; 2 points), respiratory rate ≥30 breaths per minute (OR 53.835; 95% CI, 19.711-147.033; P <.001; 3 points), and arterial pH <7.35 (OR 255.404; 95% CI, 42.701-527.608; P <.001; 4 points). The Flu-IV Score had a sensitivity of 85.5% and a specificity of 88.8%. It showed better predictive performance than the ratio of oxygen saturation (ROX) index (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC] = 0.909 vs 0.594; P =.004), modified ROX index (AUROC = 0.909 vs 0.633; P =.012), and heart rate, acidosis, state of consciousness, oxygenation, and respiratory rate (HACOR) scale (AUROC = 0.909 vs 0.622, P <.001) using the validation cohort. One study limitation was the potential for selection bias due to the study’s retrospective design, which also resulted in an inability to recover and evaluate patient vaccination data or other missing information, possibly limiting the findings’ accuracy. The authors found the Flu-IV score to be a valuable and reliable prediction tool for 14-day IMV rates in Flu-P patients. “This tool will help clinicians better evaluate the risks of early intubation for any given patient such that they can make optimal clinical judgments.

Facebook Twitter Google Plus LinkedIn Email Virus deadly to poultry detected in Kentucky flock Detection near Tennessee border has the two states responding jointly February 14, 20221,273 Views FRANKFORT Ky. — Federal and state authorities say a case of avian influenza has been detected in a flock of commercial broiler chickens in Kentucky near the state’s border with Tennessee. Kentucky State Veterinarian Dr. Katie Flynn said the United States Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) confirmed the presence of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza in samples taken from the premise in Fulton County, Kentucky. Another suspected case in Webster County, Kentucky, is waiting for final lab confirmation. Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) is known to be deadly for domesticated chickens and turkeys. On Feb. 11, a commercial chicken operation in Fulton County alerted the Kentucky Department of Agriculture of an increase in poultry deaths. Testing at the Breathitt Veterinary Center and the USDA’s National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) confirmed the presence of HPAI in samples from the commercial chicken operation. The Breathitt Veterinary Center Laboratory also obtained a non-negative avian influenza test result on the samples from a Webster County turkey flock, and NVSL confirmation is pending. “We are working diligently to prevent this virus from spreading to other poultry premises,” Dr. Flynn said. “We have activated our Avian Influenza response plan and are in active communication with state, federal, and industry partners. We encourage interested parties to sign up for significant updates at kyagr.com/HPAI.” Avian influenza does not present a food safety risk; poultry and eggs are safe to eat when handled and cooked properly. There is no risk to the food supply, but birds from the flocks will not enter the food system. No human cases of avian influenza viruses have been detected in the United States. State officials quarantined the affected premises. Federal and state partners are working jointly on additional surveillance and testing of commercial and backyard poultry flocks in the area and have established an incident command center in Fulton County to continue gathering information. The KDA has also established a 10-kilometer surveillance zone around the detected properties to determine if there are any further detections. The surveillance zone in Fulton County dips into Obion County in Tennessee due to Fulton County’s location on the border of the state line. The Tennessee Department of Agriculture (TDA) is coordinating with the Kentucky Department of Agriculture on the incident response. “It’s critical that we work together to prevent the spread of this virus,” Tennessee State Veterinarian Dr. Samantha Beaty said. “We will begin testing and surveillance of commercial and backyard flocks within the surveillance zone immediately. In Tennessee, poultry owners should report unexpected deaths to the State Vet’s office.” Information on Tennessee’s response to Avian Influenza can be found on its website at: tn.gov/agriculture/businesses/animals/animal-health/avian-influenza.html.

The presence of HPAI was confirmed when those tests were sent to the USDA National Veterinary Services Laboratories.A suspect case has also been reported in a turkey flock in Webster County, but those test results have not yet been confirmed.“We are working diligently to prevent this virus from spreading to other poultry premises,” said Kentucky State Veterinarian Dr. Katie Flynn. “We have activated our avian influenza response plan and are in active communication with state, federal and industry partners.”The affected premises has been quarantined, and federal and state partners are working on additional surveillance and testing of commercial and backyard poultry flocks in the area. An incident command center has been established in Fulton County for the participating agencies to continue to gather information.As part of the avian influenza response, a 10-kilometer surveillance zone has been set up around the affected properties. Since the 10-kilometer zone surrounding the Fulton County property stretches into Tennesseee, the KDA and the Tennessee Department of Agriculture (TDA) are coordinating with one another on the incident response.“It’s critical that we work together to prevent the spread of the virus,” said Tennessee State Veterinarian Dr. Samantha Beaty. “We will begin testing and surveillance of commercial and backyard flocks within the surveillance zone immediately. In Tennessee, poultry owners should report unexpected deaths to the state vet’s office.”The Fulton County case is the second commercial poultry flock confirmed to have contracted HPAI. Last week, HPAI was detected in a flock of commercial turkeys in Dubois County, Indiana. That flock consisted of 29,000 turkeys.View our continuing coverage of the global avian influenza situation.RecommendedLatest NewsUSPOULTRY holds seminarIndustry OrganizationsVirginia Egg Council’s Cecelia Glembocki to retireRelated StoriesEggAvian flu confirmed in Kentucky broiler flockEggNew egg carton made of recycled materials launched at IPPEEggHighly pathogenic avian flu now in Delaware, New HampshireHen Housing SystemsColored lighting could positively impact cage-free layersMore in EggIndustry OrganizationsVirginia Egg Council’s Cecelia Glembocki to retireBrand InsightsThink strategically in developing IBDV vaccination programsZoetisDeveloping vaccination programs for IBDV requires strategic use of several vaccine types.Animal WelfareNoble Foods, actor Kelvin Fletcher partner on hen welfareStructures for climbing and tires filled with dust are just a couple of the enrichment materials the egg producer provides its birds.Business and MarketsVital Farms reports over 30% net revenue boost in 2024New offerings, retail distribution gains are given as some of the reasons sales grew in the most recent quarter.Egg ProcessingWhy the egg sector should look more to pet careThere are numerous reasons why egg producers ought to more fully embrace pet nutrition and care.EggUK egg producer Farmlay invests in new grading capacityState-of-the-art egg grader, to be installed in January 2025, responds to growing consumer demand for eggs and more favorable investment climate.EggMichael Foods boosts efficiency at new Minnesota feed millLeading egg producer replaced two aging feed mills with a single, fully automated one, ushering in a new era for Gaylord feed operation.Hen Housing SystemsHow Burnbrae Farms aims to overcome activist challengesBurnbrae Farms CEO Margaret Hudson explains how the company is dealing with an active campaign from an animal activist group.Latest NewsKathy Brodhagen is new CEO at Echo Lake FoodsShe brings to the company years of experience in the egg products industry.EggHappy Egg completes merger with Egg InnovationsThe merger brings together two of the largest U.S. based free-range and pasture-raised egg companies.EuropeMoldovan farm authorized to export eggs to EUGeorge Standard has invested in improvements to production methods and raised product standards to meet the EU standards.EggBurcon launches Puratein for egg replacement applicationsEgg ProductionCooper Farms increases liquid egg productionNew silos will increase storage capacity by 50%.Page 1 of 484Next PageNews and analysis for the global poultry industryFollow WATTPoultry.comFacebook iconLinkedIn iconYouTube iconDelete My DataTopicsPoultry MeatEggPoultry HealthSustainabilityPoultry FutureMoreWebinarsBrand InsightsPodcastsWhite PapersWATT Poultry ChatTop Companies Data DownloadsMagazinesSubscribeAdvertiseAbout UsContact UsMedia RequestPrivacy PolicySite Map© 2024 All rights reserved.Seqirus eyes swift introduction of influenza vaccines into S.

To date, no studies have estimated the seasonality and latitudinal patterns of seasonal influenza in Chile. We obtained influenza-like illness (ILI) surveillance data from 29 Chilean public health networks to evaluate seasonality using wavelet analysis. We assessed the relationship between the start, peak, and latitude of the ILI epidemics using linear and piecewise regression. To estimate the presence of incoming and outgoing traveling waves (timing vs distance) between networks and to assess the association with population size, we used linear and logistic regression. We found a north to south gradient of influenza and traveling waves that were present in the central, densely populated region of Chile. Our findings suggest that larger populations in central Chile drive seasonal influenza epidemics.

Annually, influenza epidemics affect 5–10% of the world population and cause 250,000–500,000 influenza-associated deaths1. Influenza seasonality is influenced by complex interactions of biological, environmental, and social factors including viral mutations, temperature, humidity, rainfall, population crowding, and human travel2,3,4,5. Temperate regions experience peaks in influenza cases in the winter while tropical and subtropical areas are affected year-round with peaks occurring during the rainy season1,6. The virus travels from reservoirs from tropical to temperate regions and from high to low populated areas following human movement5,7,8,9,10,11,12,13. Identification of influenza seasonality is crucial for implementation of effective control strategies that can be tailored to local and national patterns5,7,14.Previous influenza timing studies have used laboratory surveillance, mortality data, and symptomatic surveillance of influenza-like illness (ILI). While ILI surveillance has a high sensitivity and low specificity, it is a useful measure to describe influenza seasonality and identify influenza population patterns15,16,17,18,19,20,21. National surveillance is established globally; however, estimating influenza dynamics within countries requires substantial subnational and local datasets. High resolution data on the local level is essential to inform prevention measures such as vaccination campaigns and provider preparedness.The majority of evidence supporting influenza timing comes from the developed countries and there are no studies of seasonal influenza timing in Chile. Chowell and colleagues found a south to north pattern of hospitalizations for H1N1 pandemic strain in 2009 in Chile that was later confirmed through mathematical simulations of the same data22,23. Influenza surveillance was enhanced after the 2009 pandemic with year-round surveillance of ILI in emergency departments (EDs), laboratory surveillance by sentinel providers, and surveillance of severe respiratory disease hospitalizations in public hospitals24. Here, we aimed to estimate the seasonality and spatial dependencies of influenza in Chile using ILI data reported in EDs.ResultsHospitals includedFrom the 78 large and medium size hospitals in Chile, we excluded three hospitals from Santiago and one from Valparaiso with < 75% of daily ED data reported for the period between 2011 and 2016. Six pairs of hospitals from Santiago were combined, four corresponded to the merging of a pediatric and adult hospital (S2). We included 65 hospitals from the 15 regions and the 29 Chilean public health networks (Fig. 1).Figure 1Hospital location and ILI rates, Chile 2010–2016. Left panel. Location of hospitals included through the Chilean territory. Right panel: Y axis, represent Hospitals ordered by latitude corresponding to the grouped zones marked by horizontal lines. X axis, time in days from 2010 to 2016. Gradient colors represent rates of ILI per 100,000 population. Z-score of log10 transformed shown for better visualization24,27.Full size imageA total of 242,982 ILI cases were reported from January 2010 to December 2016. Sixty-five percent of the days (n = 1.782.470) reported zero cases and 34% (n = 959,792) had ≥ 1 case reported. One percent (n = 1861) were days with missing data that ranged from 0 to 5% of the time series in different hospitals.Influenza-like illness rates presented a cyclic pattern and synchrony across hospitals specially in 2010 with a spread pattern in the following years (Fig. 1).Predominant annual seasonalityWe discovered a predominant annual seasonality for ILI rates in Chile. The annual pattern of ILI was present in the original time series and in the wavelet-reconstructed data (Fig. 2a). The local wavelet power spectrum showed an annual seasonality within periods from 40 to 64 weeks and the highest average power for period of 50 weeks (Fig. 2b and c, respectively).Figure 2Detrended ILI incidence rate, wavelet reconstruction, local wavelet power spectrum and average power per period, Chile 2010–2016.

Dark red represent higher power, yellow represents low power and fit, white spaces denote non-significant power compared to white noise. (b) Cumulative power z-score to calculate the periods with best fit across hospitals, represented as the 95th percentile of cumulative power. Power for each hospital were normalized, log transform, subtracted from the mean, and divided by the standard deviation. The sum of z-score for each period was plotted with the 95th percentile (dotted lines in both a and b)24,27.Full size imageThe best seasonality, calculated as the 95th percentile of power, was observed between 46 and 53 weeks for all hospitals, health networks, and Chile overall (Figs. 2, 3, and S3 respectively)). Consequently, we used an annual periodicity from 46 to 53 weeks to filter the Morlet wavelet from each health network.Start and peak day of seasonal influenza in health networksThe median start and peak of the epidemic for all health networks and years was May 11th and August 4th, respectively (start day 131 of each year; IQR 117, 152 and peak day 217; IQR 200, 237, respectively). The median duration from start to peak was 84 days (IQR 82, 88), equivalent of 12 weeks or three months.Despite the variability of start and peak day between and within health networks, there was consistency of timing of ILI across Chile. The duration of the epidemic was constant across health networks and latitudes (S4).Influenza-like illness epidemics tended to start earlier than the previous year between 2010 and 2013, but from 2014 the start was delayed in each successive year. No significant association was found between the peak of the epidemic and predominant strain in the country for each year (S5).Population and a north to south pattern associated to early annual epidemicsThe univariate analysis showed that as latitude increased from north to south, the start and peak of the influenza season were delayed (Fig. 4). While there was a significant association between latitude and timing in the central zone of Chile (Fig. 4c and d), no association was present in the north or south of the country. There was a positive association between population size and earlier start and peak time of influenza. Given that influenza seasons vary annually, years was analyzed as a categorical variable and showed a significant association between start and peak day. Similarly, each year had a predominant strain in the country. The H3N2 strain had an earlier peak day and a shorter start-peak time compared to H1N1 strain. The presence of an airport in the territory of a health network was not associated with influenza timing (S6).Figure 4Start and peak of ILI vs latitude, 29 health networks in Chile, 2010–2016.

A negative association was found between start date and population size (β = − 0.3; 95% CI, − 0.5 − −0.1; P < 0.01). Health networks with a nearby airport was associated with an estimated delay of 9.5 days for the start of an ILI epidemic (95% CI, 0.84 − 18.19; P < 0.05). A north to south pattern was found across the country, for one degree increase in latitude there was one day delay on the start of ILI (β = 0.903; 95% CI 0.315 − 1.491; P < 0.01) (Eq. 1 and Table 2).$$ Sd = 170.9 + 0.9\left( {Lat} \right) - 0.31\left( {Pop10,000} \right) + 9.5\left( {Airport} \right) + 49.7 \left( {Y2010} \right) + 30.5\left( {Y2011} \right) + 12.9 \left( {Y2012} \right) + 14.8\left( {Y2014} \right) + 23.5\left( {Y2015} \right) + 23.3(Y2016) $$ (1) where Sd = Start day from January 1st from each year; Lat = South Latitude; Airport = Presence of an airport; Y = Dummy for the year noted.Table 1 Multivariate regression model selection for influenza-like illness start day and peak day, using best subset method.Full size tableTable 2 Selected multivariate models for ILI start day and peak day.Full size tableThe best model for ILI peak included eight variables: latitude, population and year as a dummy variable (R2 = 0.40; P < 0.01) (Table 1).

We found a descending Spearman’s correlation of phase angles up to 1250 km that disappeared for larger distances (Fig. 5a) in both the reconstructed wavelet analysis and in the original rate time series data (S7). As a result, we included health networks closer than 1250 km in each model of local traveling waves.Figure 5Distance vs pairwise Spearman's correlation and travelling waves of influenza in health networks. Chile 2010–2016. (a) Spearman’s correlation of phase angles versus distance between all pairs of health networks. Dashed lines represent the average correlation. The model used a loess model with α = 0.75 (red line) and 95% CI (grey). There is a change in the descending relation of correlation and distance at 1250 km that we used as the upper distance limit to define local wave. (b) Phase difference in weeks vs distance (km) for Health Networks with incoming (red) and outgoing (blue) waves. In grey linear models with a significance level of 0.05. In red and blue, linear models with a Bonferroni corrected significance level < 0.001. The distance sign was inverted for negative lag times for a more intuitive display of incoming waves. (c) Geographic location of health networks with significant traveling waves. Incoming and outgoing waves are clustered in the center of the country. Colors correspond to panel (b)24,27.Full size imageThere were 11 health networks with outgoing traveling waves and 10 that presented incoming waves located at the center and southern regions of Chile (P < 0.0017) (Fig. 5b and c). Local traveling waves were associated with population size after adjusting for latitude. For every 10,000 individuals, a health network had a 23% greater odds of presenting local outgoing waves (OR = 1.23; 95% CI 95, 1.05 − 1.44; P = 0.001) and 18% higher odds of presenting incoming waves (OR = 1.18; 95% CI, 1.03 − 1.34; P = 0.01) (S8). Both logistic regression models had excellent discrimination for outgoing and incoming waves (AUC = 0.914, 95% CI 0.8 − 1.0 and AUC = 0.884, 95% CI 0.729 − 1.0, respectively).DiscussionWe found a predominant annual seasonality of influenza in Chile with a periodicity of 50 weeks (95% CI, 43 − 53). This period coincided with the annual seasonality of influenza reported from other temperate territories and from the Chilean Ministry of Health influenza surveillance reports48. To our knowledge, this is the first study that confirms a cycle of seasonal influenza in Chile.There was a north–south latitudinal gradient for the start and peak of influenza related to the central zone between latitudes 31 and 40 degrees south. Chowell and colleagues found a south to north hospitalization gradient for the H1N1 2009 pandemic22. The difference between Chowell results and our findings can be explained by the annual variability of influenza epidemics due to weather, population immunity, or human movement49. We did not include 2009 data in our analysis; however, we found a south-north latitudinal gradient in 2015 for the start date of the ILI season (S9). In the 2009 and 2015 epidemics, the first influenza cases were reported in southern cities with populations greater than 200,000. While health networks consisting of large populations from central Chile have a higher probability of reporting the first cases of influenza, southern zones with relatively large populations can also experience epidemics.Population size was also associated with the start and peak of influenza epidemics as described previously in Perú, Hong Kong, Brazil and the USA5,7,12,13,21. The patterns found were mostly influenced by the center region of Chile which includes Santiago, the nation’s capital and most populated city. The outward, rapid spread of influenza from Santiago to the rest of the country has been previously reported by Burger et al. in Chile and are similar to the findings described by Viboud et al. in the USA5,23. These findings are supported by the association between population and the presence of local incoming and outgoing wave. Health networks with significant local outgoing and incoming traveling waves were primarily located in central Chile; two networks with significant incoming waves were also located in the southern region. Our findings suggest that larger populations located in the center of the country drive seasonal influenza epidemics. Health networks in the central zone spread influenza to neighboring networks through outgoing traveling waves. Networks receive incoming waves in the same zone and in southern Chile.This study has several limitations. We assumed that all hospitals had the same age distribution and did not adjust for age structure of health networks. Controlling for age may provide more detailed information on influenza transmission in future studies. We did not include ED data from private insurance companies, hospitals, or practices because they were not available; however, public insurance covers 74% of the population in Chile26. Additionally, we included data from hospitals located in a range of latitudes that are collected through a centralized reporting system with national guidelines24. While we used secondary ILI case data from ED reports that were based on clinical diagnosis without laboratory confirmation, laboratory surveillance is available only for 25 hospitals with partial coverage of the countries´ territory. ILI has been reported as a useful measure to describe influenza seasonality and identify influenza population patterns21. On the other hand, ILI surveillance operates in all Chilean hospital EDs year-round resulting in more complete seasonality data. We assumed a constant proportion of emergency consultation to other providers. Private hospitals, private practices, and public primary healthcare centers could attract patients with public insurance, especially in seasons of high demand. We assessed this limitation by estimating the population with public insurance that lives in a 5 km radius that are more likely to visit a hospital ED compared to a public or private provider. Instead of assuming an annual seasonality, we estimated the best seasonality before fitting our models. We selected the best models for the start and peak of influenza by comparing all possible models.This is the first study to estimate seasonal influenza seasonality in Chile and its patterns across latitudes. Novel strains should be considered when different patterns are detected. If a novel strain is detected early, patterns could differ from the ones found here.Our findings can help decision-makers to prepare for the influenza season by prioritizing zones for early vaccination campaigns, reallocating hospital beds for annual epidemics, and distributing resources according to patterns of influenza. Zones with larger populations and those located in the center of the country would require earlier implementation of interventions to reduce the spread of influenza to regions across the country.MethodsData sourcesWe obtained daily ILI case data collected by the Chilean Ministry of Health between 2010 and 2016 from public hospitals EDs. ILI is an acceptable measure that is correlated to laboratory surveillance regarding population patterns21. We used ILI from ED rather than sentinel laboratory surveillance data given that influenza surveillance is limited to 25 hospitals in the country with limited territorial coverage. We supplemented gridded population data from WorldPop with official governmental data on hospital locations, census information, and population coverage to estimate the population with access to each hospital25,26,27,28.We excluded community hospitals, hospitals without an ED, and hospitals that reported < 75% of daily ED data between 2011 and 2016 (< 1920 days). Hospitals that had ≥ 5% missing data in groups of 20 consecutive days were also excluded to reduce imputation errors. We assumed missing data were missing at random. Twelve different imputation methods were tested using randomly generated missing data compared to the original data. Time series imputation with Kalman Smoothing showed the best results for estimating seasonality compared to the original data29,30.Data preparationGiven that patients experience a decline in ED access with increasing distance, we chose a five kilometer radius to estimate the population covered by each hospital31,32. We obtained the population estimates per 100 × 100 m grid from WorldPop for 2010 and 2015 and adjusted by census data for each municipality and year28. We used linear interpolation to impute population estimates for 2011 − 2014, and 2016. For each hospital coverage area, we adjusted for the proportion of individuals with public insurance for each municipality per year and calculated daily rates of ILI over the estimated population26. Data from hospitals in the same health network and within 5 km from each other were combined into one time series. To determine seasonality across health networks, we calculated the ILI rate by network by adding ILI and population data from all hospitals within each health network. We used a mid-point location from hospitals within each network to determine the health network’s latitude.Data transformation using waveletsWe used wavelet analysis to determine the best periodicity (e.g. seasonality) of influenza across 29 Chilean health networks. Wavelet transformation is an adequate method to determine seasonality for non-stationary time series and to determine seasonality of a periodic time series without assuming a priori a specific seasonality33. Wavelet transformation corresponds to the cross-correlation of ILI rate’s time series with wavelets of different “widths” or “scales” across time33. Morlet wavelet has been used to calculate infectious disease rates for dengue, pertussis, measles, and influenza34,35,36,37,38,39. We computed the Morlet wavelet transformation for the entire country, each health network, and each individual hospital34,35,40.We conducted wavelet transformations for periods (scales) from 14 − 144 weeks. Statistical significance was tested by comparing the wave signal against 1000 randomly generated time series (i.e. white noise) with a significance level of 0.0541. The local wavelet power spectrum was used to visualize the cross-correlation between rates and each group of wavelets (Fig. 2b, S1 and Equation s1)33,42.To determine the best seasonality (periods with higher power), we computed the average power for each period, over all time points, from the local wavelet power spectrum for Chile, each health network, and for individual hospitals, according to the work of Torrence42:$$ \overline{W}^{2} \left( s \right) = \frac{1}{N} \mathop \sum \limits_{n = 0}^{N} \left| {Wn\left( s \right)} \right|^{2} $$ (3) where N represents the number of observations.We defined the best seasonality of influenza as the range of periods within the 95th percentile of average power across periods.Association between epidemic timing and latitude in health networksTo determine the association between influenza timing and latitude, we selected the wavelet transform using the range corresponding to the best seasonality for each health network. We reconstructed the epidemic cycles using the filter defined by Torrence and Campo (S1 and Equation s2)42. For each health network, the start date of an annual ILI epidemic was defined as the date when the reconstructed cycles reached the midpoint between the lowest point and the peak of the signal for each year from 2010 to 2016. We calculated the peak day for the corresponding period along with the median start and peak date for each health network.We developed univariate, piecewise, and multivariate linear regression models to assess the relationship between the predictor, latitude, and start and peak outcomes of the epidemic across the health networks. For the piecewise models, we separated the country into three zones: north, center, and south with south latitude ranges of < 31, 31–40, and > 41, respectively. For multivariate analysis, we included latitude and population as continuous variables, a binary variable to describe the presence of an airport within the health network territory, and dummy variables for years 2010 to 2016 with 2013 as the reference. The predominant influenza strain was excluded due to linear dependencies with years 2011 and 2014. The final multivariate model was selected by testing all possible predictor combinations with the regression sum of squares method and by comparing the BIC and Mallow’s Cp43.Local traveling waves of influenzaA Morlet wavelet is a complex function with a real and an imaginary part. The real part enables separation of the amplitude and extraction of the phase of a signal as the timing within a specific period, regardless of the amplitude33,42,44. Phases are continuous cycles that are presented as phase angles in radians from -π to + π41. We extracted phase angles using a band of periods within the 95th percentile of power as described previously by Torrence (S1 and Eq. 3).In order to define a local traveling wave, we used a second-degree local polynomial regression model (LOESS) with Spearman’s correlation between pairs of health networks phase angle time series to distance with parameter α = 0.75. Then, we determined the distance were the smallest correlation after an initial linear segment of the LOESS model was found. All pairs of health networks within this distance limit were included for each of the 29 linear models for traveling waves.We calculated the phase angle (timing) time-series median difference for all possible pairs of health networks and tested the association to distance. The sign of the phase difference represented the relative timing of ILI. A negative difference indicated a delayed timing of influenza (incoming); positive difference indicated outgoing travelling waves. We fitted two linear models for each health network to all others, one for positive phase differences and the second for negative phase difference:$$ \theta _{{p,q}} = \left\{ {\begin{array}{*{20}c} {C - \beta _{p} d_{{p,q}} \quad for \quad \theta < 0,\quad incoming\;waves} \\ {C + \beta _{p} d_{{p,q}} \quad for \quad \theta > 0, \quad outgoing\;waves} \\ \end{array} } \right\} $$ (4) where θp,q is the lag between health networks p and q and dp,q is the distance in kilometers between health networks. The distance sign was inverted for negative lag times for a more intuitive display of incoming waves. We considered a local traveling wave as a significant linear association between phase difference and distance using a corrected Bonferroni significance level of 0.0017.We developed separate logistic regression models for incoming and outgoing waves to determine the association between traveling waves and population estimates, adjusting for each health network latitude. To evaluate model discrimination, we used the receiver operating characteristic curve and the area under the curve (AUC)45.We used R version 3.6.2 R package Leaps for model selection, and R package WaveletComp for wavelet transformation and phases extraction46,47.Previous presentations This work has not been previously presented or published.

By Madelyn Ostendorf Madelyn Ostendorf Resides in: Ames, Iowa Madelyn joined the Successful Farming team in 2021 as a Digital Content Editor, focusing on livestock and and Successful Farming's digital presence. Her role expanded to working on Successful Farming's College Edition. Madelyn has previously served in a variety of communications roles, including the print managing editor of the Iowa State Daily and communications intern for the Egg Industry Center. Successful Farming's Editorial Guidelines Published on February 14, 2022 Close On February 11, federal and state authorities in Kentucky were alerted to a case of avian influenza in a flock of commercial broiler chickens near the border with Tennessee. State officials quarantined the premises, and an additional suspected case in a turkey flock in Webster County, Kentucky, is awaiting confirmation. Kentucky's Department of Agriculture established a 10-kilometer surveillance zone to determine if other cases can be detected. That zone enters Obion County, Tennessee, and the two Departments of Agriculture are working to coordinate on the incident response. "We are working diligently to prevent this virus from spreading to other poultry premises," says Kentucky State Veterinarian Katie Flynn. "We have activated our avian influenza response plan and are in active communication with state, federal, and industry partners. We encourage interested parties to sign up for significant updates at kyagr.com/HPAI." Kentucky ranks seventh in the nation in broiler production, and in 2020 the state's broiler and egg industry brought in $856 million. Last week, Indiana reported a case of avian influenza in a turkey flock in Dubois County, the first case in a commercial flock since 2020. In an announcement, the USDA also identified a backyard flock of mixed species birds that had been detected with avian influenza in Fauquier County, Virginia.

Viral surface glycans shield vulnerable protein epitopes from host immunity yet can also present distinct “glycoepitopes” that can be targeted by host antibodies such as the potent anti-HIV antibody 2G12 that binds high-mannose glycans on gp120. Two recent publications demonstrate 2G12 binding to high mannose glycans on SARS-CoV-2 and select Influenza A (Flu) H3N2 viruses. Previously, our lab observed 2G12 binding and functional inhibition of a range of Flu viruses that include H3N2 and H1N1 lineages. In this manuscript, we present these data alongside structural analyses to offer an expanded picture of 2G12-Flu interactions. Further, based on the remarkable breadth of 2G12 N-glycan recognition and the structural factors promoting glycoprotein oligomannosylation, we hypothesize that 2G12 glycoepitopes can be defined from protein structure alone according to N-glycan site topology. We develop a model describing 2G12 glycoepitopes based on N-glycan site topology, and apply the model to identify viruses within the Protein Data Bank presenting putative 2G12 glycoepitopes for 2G12 repurposing toward analytical, diagnostic, and therapeutic applications.

The surface of a virus presents epitopes of varying complexities ranging from a defined region on a single protein domain to interfaces involving several copies of the surface protein along different axes of symmetry in the entire viral assembly1,2. In this context, many viral surface antigens are also heavily glycosylated by the host’s glycosylation machinery and glycans displayed on the viral surface play multifaceted roles in virus-host interaction and adaptation of the virus to the host3,4,5.Complex glycans are added to viral surface proteins as a part of the post-translational modification during viral replication in the host. The adaptation of a virus to its host can involve mutations that either add or remove glycosylation sites so as to evade host immune response by either masking or modifying a previously exposed epitope surface6,7,8. Although complex glycans on the viral surface are not likely to elicit an immune response, the clustering of these glycosylation sites on the viral surface antigens can generate distinct types of glycans that are different from the typical glycans present on host glycoproteins9. Distinct high-mannose type N-linked glycan structures are present on clustered glycosylation sites of the gp120 envelope protein of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)10, primarily as a result of clustered N-linked glycans sterically-interfering with α-mannosidase function11. The presence of high-mannose N-linked glycosylation across diverse pathogen surfaces prompted previous studies to investigate if specific glycan-binding proteins or lectins can bind to these high mannose glycans and neutralize these viruses. Specifically, mannose-binding lectins including those from human C-type lectin family12 and plant lectins such as banana lectins13 have been demonstrated to bind high-mannose type glycan structures displayed on surfaces of diverse pathogens such as HIV and influenza viruses.The distinct glycosylation patterns on viral surfaces also present “glycoepitopes” that are targets of antibodies generated by the host immune response to neutralize the virus. The evidence of such glycoepitopes is best established in the case of the HIV gp1203,14. Several antibodies isolated from HIV patients target these glycoepitopes on gp120 and effectively neutralize the virus15,16,17. Among these antibodies the 2G12 antibody is unique in two aspects. First, instead of the conventional “Y” shape with 2 antigen binding Fab domains (VH–VL, VH′–VL′), 2G12 has an additional binding site formed by cross over of VH domains of each Fab (VH–VL′, VH′–VL and VH–VH′)18. Second, unlike other HIV antibodies that interact with both the glycan and the underlying protein surface (“glycan-protein glycoepitopes”19), 2G12 recognizes a solely glycan-based glycoepitope comprised of high-mannose type glycans at glycosylation sites including N295, N332, N339, and N392 on gp12020,21. Mutational studies to knockout these four glycosylation sites and nearby sites on gp120 have provided insights on the relative contributions of each glycan to the binding affinity of 2G1222, revealing that 2G12 maintains high-affinity binding to a range of similar glycan configurations. Given this observation, in combination with evidence that 2G12 binds SARS-CoV-2 spike protein23,24, the hemagglutinin (HA) of certain Influenza H3N2 viruses25, and glycoproteins of S. cerevisiae26, the anti-glycan antibody 2G12 is likely to target the glycoproteins of additional viruses. Yet, as 2G12-glycoprotein interactions do not depend directly on the protein surface itself, existing methods to identify novel repurposing targets for antibodies based on protein sequences and structures are not suited for predicting new targets for 2G12.In this study, we first present experimental data describing interactions between 2G12 and a set of H1N1 and H3N2 viruses. Our results are consistent with recently published data25 on 2G12-H3N2 interactions, yet extend these findings to certain H1N1 viruses and further demonstrate how certain N-glycan topologies on H3N2 enhance 2G12’s binding, functional inhibition, and neutralization potency. Second, we present a structural analysis of 2G12 interactions across HIV22, Flu25, and SARS-CoV-223 to define a generalized model for 2G12 glycoepitopes based on N-glycan site topology at the protein surface. Finally, we hypothesized that any other viral surface glycoprotein that possesses a similar N-glycan site topology can potentially be recognized by 2G12. We therefore apply our model to survey the Protein Data Bank for glycoproteins that 2G12 putatively binds. The resulting “hits” serve as a list of viruses for which 2G12 repurposing toward analytical, diagnostic, and therapeutic applications may prove valuable.Results2G12 binds, functionally inhibits, and neutralizes select Influenza H1N1 and H3N2It was recently reported than 2G12 binds and neutralizes select H3N2 Influenza A viruses25. At the time of this publication, our lab was evaluating unpublished data for interactions between 2G12 and a number of Influenza A viruses which we report now to expand the understanding of these interactions. Here we provide evidence indicating that 2G12 binds, functionally inhibits, and neutralizes a number of additional Influenza A viruses including H1N1 lineages (Fig. 1, Table 1). Briefly, we find that 2G12 binds H1N1 A/SoI/06 and H3N2 A/Per/09, A/Bris/07, A/Wy/03 at concentrations below 1 ug/mL, but only very weakly binds H1N1 Ca/09 (Fig. 1A).Figure 1(A) Binding of 2G12 to full length recombinant HA from representative H1N1 and H3N2 strains in a quantitative ELISA (n = 3). Pink circles, HA from A/Solomon Island/2006 (H1N1); orange squares, HA from A/California/2009 (H1N1); dark green triangles, HA from A/Brisbane/2007 (H3N2); green triangles, HA from A/Perth/2009 (H3N2); blue diamond, HA from A/Wyoming/2003 (H3N2). (B) 2G12 inhibits agglutination of red blood cells by inactive influenza viruses. 4 HAU of inactive influenza viruses were incubated with serial dilution of 2G12 starting at 100 ug/mL for 45 min on ice followed by addition of 2% turkey red blood cells.Full size imageTable 1 2G12 neutralizes select H3N2 viruses in vitro.Full size tableFurther, we evaluated 2G12’s ability to functionally inhibit the HA of certain representative H1N1 and H3N2 viruses. Turkey red blood cells (tRBCs) predominantly express α2 → 6 sialylated glycan receptors that specifically bind to HA from human-adapted viruses. We thus measured the ability of 2G12 to inhibit agglutination of tRBCs by representative human-adapted H1N1 and H3N2 viruses (Fig. 1B). We find functional inhibition of HA from both H3N2 and H1N1 viruses, with the strongest effect identified for H3N2 A/Br/07 (inhibition as low as 1.6 ug/mL). Inhibition of H1N1 viruses was weaker, with the strongest effect identified for A/SoI/06 (25 ug/mL).Finally, consistent with 2G12’s effective inhibition of tRBC agglutination, we find that 2G12 neutralizes live H3N2 viruses. 2G12 potently inhibited the induction of CPE by Bris/07 with an EC50 of 0.1ug/ml. Inhibition of CPE induction by 2G12 was also observed for A/Sydney/97 (Syd/97) and A/Perth/11/2009 (Perth/09) H3N2 strains, albeit at a 10–20-fold lower concentration (Table 1). 2G12 failed to neutralize A/Vic/75. Importantly, the viruses surveyed here feature similar yet distinct N-glycans site topologies on the HA stalk, often in a ± 1 N-glycan site format. We therefore sought to evaluate the totality of the binding, inhibition, and neutralization data in light of the N-glycan topology for these viruses to expand our understanding of the structural basis for 2G12 interactions.A pair of N-glycan sites on the HA head is sufficient-but not optimal-for 2G12 interactionsLee et al.25 reported that a pair of N-glycans on the H3N2 HA head at sites N165 and N246 mediate overhead 2G12 binding poses and are critical for 2G12 neutralization of H3N2 viruses. Our data expand the understanding of N-glycan topology required for 2G12 interactions with HA, providing evidence that (1) homologous pairs of N-glycans on the H1N1 head are sufficient to mediate 2G12 binding and functional inhibition, and (2) glycans other than N165 and N246 on the H3N2 head significantly enhance 2G12 binding, functional inhibition, and neutralization.First, we find that H1N1 A/SoI/06 and A/NC/99 present N-glycans pairs on the HA head (N142, N177; Fig. 2B), and that 2G12 binds and functionally inhibits these strains (Fig. 1A,B). In contrast, H1N1 A/Ca/09 presents a more substantial stalk N-glycan cluster than A/SoI/06 and lacks a pair of head N-glycans, but is only weakly bound by 2G12 at saturating concentrations. Together, these data suggest that the pair of head N-glycans on A/SoI/06 and A/NC/99 is responsible for 2G12 binding and functional inhibition of these viruses. These data highlight the critical role that a single pair of clustered N-glycans can play at quaternary junctions, and we hypothesize that the mode of interaction between 2G12 and A/SoI/06 is likely analogous to the overhead quaternary pose reported for H3N2 viruses by Lee et al.25.Figure 2HA head N-glycan topology of Influenza A viruses tested for 2G12 binding, functional inhibition, and neutralization. Surface representations of HA are shown in white with N-glycan sites highlighted in red and the receptor binding site (RBS) outlined in blue. (A) A/Syd/97, A/Wy/03, A/Bris/07, and A/Per/09 all feature the N-glycan pair at N165 and N246, plus two to four additional adjacent N-glycan sites. These viruses are more potently bound, inhibited, and neutralized by 2G12, and include N-glycans with varying degrees of proximity to the RBS. (B) A/SoI/06, A/NC/99, A/Ind/11, and A/Vic/75 present pairs of N-glycan sites on the HA head, while A/Ca/09 features a single N-glycan site on the HA head (reverse, not shown). H1N1 and H3N2 viruses solely presenting N-glycan pairs on the HA head are weakly bound and functionally inhibited by 2G12 (Table S1).Full size imageSecond, our data suggests that glycan pairs on the HA head alone are not optimal for 2G12 interactions. Examining the N-glycan site topology for H3N2 A/Ind/11 and H3N2 A/Vic/75 (Fig. 2A), which both feature N-glycan pairs in isolation, we find that these H3N2 viruses as well as the previously mentioned H1N1 viruses show weak functional inhibition (A/Ind/11 at 12.5 ug/mL, A/SoI/06 at 25 ug/mL, A/NC/99 at 25 ug/mL) and a lack of neutralization (no neutralization observed for A/Vic/75) relative to Flu viruses presenting additional head N-glycans. That is, H3N2 viruses bearing more substantial N-glycan clusters are the most potent binders (A/Per/09 and A/Br/07), inhibitors (A/Br/07 at 1.6 ug/mL), and neutralizers (A/Br/07 EC50 at 0.1 ug/mL). Note that we find 2G12 binding strength is not directly correlated with the number of head N-glycans, suggesting the specific N-glycan cluster topology influences 2G12 activity. While N-glycan pairs may be sufficient—and certain N-glycan pairs may be critical—these pairs alone do not appear optimal for 2G12 interactions.The structural data on Flu-2G12 interactions presented by Lee et al.25 suggests that non-overhead or partially-overhead binding poses may explain how additional head N-glycans optimize 2G12 binding and neutralization. The Lee et al.25 negative-stain electron microscopy (nsEM) images indicate a variety of poses for 2G12 bound to HA that include poses in which 2G12 is not strictly overhead of HA and others in which 2G12 runs parallel to the vertical axis of HA25. These additional poses suggest that N-glycans other than N165 and N246 may be directly involved in the 2G12 binding event. We therefore next examine how different head N-glycan topologies contribute functionally to 2G12-Flu interactions.There is a binding vs. neutralization tradeoff dictated by N-glycan topology on the H3N2 HA headWhile it is clear that additional N-glycan clustering on the HA head contributes to more effective 2G12 interactions, our data provide further evidence that the specific topology of head glycans drives a tradeoff between binding strength and neutralization potency. We observe that the strongest binder (A/Per/09, EC50 = 0.35 nM) is not the most potent neutralizer (EC50 = 1.5 ug/mL). Rather, A/Bris/07 neutralizes with more than an order of magnitude higher potency (EC50 = 0.1 ug/mL) despite binding with twofold lower strength (EC50 = 0.73 nM). The key difference between the N-glycan topologies for these two viruses is the additional N-glycan at site N144 for A/Bris/07. The N144 N-glycan is directly adjacent to the major functional site for HA—the receptor binding site (RBS)—offering a straightforward explanation for the significant increase in neutralization potency against A/Bris/07. That is, the N144 glycan may promote 2G12 binding poses that sterically interfere with RBS function to a greater extent than HA glycan clusters lacking an N144 glycan. Further, it is plausible that binding strength to A/Bris/07 is relatively reduced as a result of the glycan at site N133 disrupting binding poses spanning from N144 to N165/N246, as the N133 glycan would reside in the middle of the 2G12 paratope potentially creating a steric constraint for 2G12 binding. Such a mechanism has precedent in the literature on interactions between 2G12 and gp120 in which the glycan at site N411 resides in the middle of the 2G12 paratope, and it has been observed that knockout of this glycan enhances 2G12 binding strength beyond that of wild type gp12022. Indeed, consistent with these two hypotheses, the highest affinity monomeric glycoepitope (A/Per/09) is highly planar and can be visualized as presenting both monomeric and quaternary glycoepitopes according to the poses imaged in Lee at al.25. We next sought to integrate these functional observations across H1N1 and H3N2 viruses alongside existing structural models of 2G12 interactions with HIV and SARS-CoV-2 to build a topological model for 2G12 interactions with predictive potential.Model of 2G12 topological glycoepitopes across HIV, Flu, and SARS-CoV-2To define a generalizable model for topological glycoepitopes recognized by 2G12, we leveraged data across the three known viruses 2G12 binds to: HIV, Flu, and SARS-CoV-2. Specifically, we analyzed structural features from co-crystal complexes (6OZC22; 7L0923) and functional data from experimental binding and neutralization assays (38; Fig. 1). Further, we incorporated the theoretical basis for clustered N-glycans promoting high-mannose species11 and performed computational glycan docking experiments to derive broad distributions of allowable 2G12 binding poses. By integrating these data, we learn from both the epitope and paratope sides of the 2G12 epitope-paratope interaction to define a generalizable topological model (Fig. 3).Figure 32G12 Topological glycoepitope model and validation. (A) Left, Paratope: From the structures of 2G12 complexed to HIV BG505 (6OZC22) and SARS-CoV-2 spike (7L0923), we derive a distribution of canonical Man4–Man9 poses (shown as mesh) amenable to binding the 2G12 primary binding sites, and a corresponding distribution of N-glycan sites (shown as individual spheres). The most distant pair of N-glycan sites giving rise to a theoretically acceptable 2G12 binding pose are 60 Å apart. Right, Epitope: From the epitope side of the 2G12 interactions, we examine the clustering of primary (purple spheres) and secondary (red or blue spheres) N-glycan sites, and the steric constraints of ER α1,2-mannosidase11 (5KIJ29). These features contribute to oligomannosylation at the primary Asn, secondary binding site interactions, and indirectly to the binding event via network effects (e.g., glycan support and stability). Middle: We integrate information from the epitope and paratope sides of the interaction to develop a simple feature set describing N-glycan site topologies likely to present 2G12 glycoepitopes. (B) 2G12 glycoepitope scores correlate with 2G12 binding strength. The apparent binding strength for 2G12 and 13 viral and non-viral glycoproteins measured in this study and elsewhere is plotted against the 2G12 glycoepitope score returned by the glycoepitope model for each glycoprotein. A statistically significant linear relationship is observed (p < 0.005), suggesting that the glycoepitope model provides a degree of predictive utility. *Note that for the glycoproteins measured in Zhang et al., 201526, solved structures do not exist and so high confidence Alpha Fold 228 predictions were employed (90%+ predicted accuracy for all sites). The S. cerevisiae glycoprotein predictions are limited to monomeric glycoepitopes, potentially explaining their systemic underscoring relative to other glycoprotein structures scored that include both monomeric and quaternary glycoepitopes.Full size imageAs observed in the structure of 2G12 bound to HIV BG505 SOSIP.664 (6OZC22), 2G12 has two distinct primary binding sites with each site binding to a high mannose glycan at N295 and N392 with preference for the terminal α1–2 linked-mannose at the d1 arm of Man918. Further, 2G12 presents a third binding “surface” formed at the VH–VH′ crossover interface, which interacts with additional mannose sugars in the d2 and d3 branches of two high-mannose glycans at N332 and N33922. Meanwhile, the 2G12-SARS-CoV-2 spike complex (7L0923) indicates that a single high-mannose N-glycan at N717 is capable of interacting with both the primary and secondary 2G12 binding sites simultaneously. Data from 2G12-H3N2/H1N1 interactions (38, Fig. 1) suggest that a single pair of high-mannose N-glycans is capable of meditating 2G12 binding via the primary and secondary binding sites, though there is insufficient structural data to determine the nature of the secondary interactions.Considering the totality of this structural and functional data it is appealing and logical to define a glycoepitope model based on N-linked glycans whose terminal mannose form a rhombus shape mirroring the 2G12 paratope, with the long axis defined by the primary binding sites (VH–VL′, VH′–VL) and the short axis defined by the secondary surface (VH–VH′). However, such a definition would limit application of the model as it would depend critically on N-glycan structures which tend not to be fully solved in most glycoprotein structures. Further, even structures that include full-length high-quality N-glycans (or computational approaches to populating N-glycans) would still not represent the range of conformations flexible glycans can adopt during 2G12 binding. Thus, we instead build our model based on the topology of Asn residues at N-glycan sites, as the minimal binding determinant for 2G12 appears to be a pair of N-glycan sites presenting high-mannose N-glycans capable of interacting with the two 2G12 primary binding sites, while nearby N-glycans sites clustered around these two primary N-glycan sites promote high-mannose species at the primary sites and interact with the secondary VH–VH′ binding surface. Toward not overfitting the limited structural information available (i.e., scoring glycoepitopes based on an “ideal” distance between primary binding N-glycan sites for gp120 of ~ 21.9 Å), we selected the simplest feature set that satisfies these objectives while also modeling distributions of possible N-glycan poses (Fig. 3), specifically:Feature 1: A surface exposed pair of N-glycan sites, wherein the two Asn residues (termed primary Asn) can be docked with canonical Man4-Man9 glycans such that there is a pose in which both glycans interact via a terminal mannose with the 2G12 primary binding sites. Feature 2: Additional surface exposed N-glycan sites (termed secondary Asn) whose Asn residue is sufficiently close to a primary Asn to (1) sterically impair N-glycan processing by α1,2-mannosidase and (2) interact with the secondary binding surfaces of 2G12, where the number and proximity of these secondary sites is proportional to the likelihood of mediating these effects. We derive primary Asn site distributions from a glycan docking exercise using 25 canonical Man4-Man9 glycans obtained from the Glycan Fragment Database27, and clustering radii are computed based on steric constraints of ER α1,2-mannosidase11 (Fig. 3A; see “Materials and methods” section). From this derivation, we find that satisfactory primary Asn pairs lie along a 60 Å axis that is rotated approximately 30° relative to the 2G12 paratope, and that secondary Asn tend to reside within 20 Å of each primary Asn. We subsequently wrote a lightweight algorithm to score all combinations of N-glycan sites on a given glycoprotein structure based on these two features (see “Materials and methods” section).Toward validating the 2G12 glycoepitope model, we examined the relationship between model score and apparent 2G12 binding strength to 13 viral and non-viral glycoproteins (Fig. 3B). We identified 13 glycoproteins with measured 2G12 binding strength in the literature or in our lab, consisting of the following antigens: HIV-derived BG50522, SARS-CoV-2 spike protein23, Hemagglutinin from seven Influenza lineages spanning four sub-types, and four non-viral glycoproteins derived from S. cerevisiae26. Structures of the four S. cerevisiae glycoproteins are not solved and so were predicted via Alpha Fold 228, which returned predicted structures with high confidence (90%+) at all sites. We found a linear correlation between the apparent 2G12 binding strength and the modeled glycoepitope score (R2 = 0.60, p < 0.005), suggesting that the model offers predictive value for identifying high-affinity 2G12 glycoepitopes. Notably, the S. cerevisiae glycoproteins appear to be systematically underscored by the algorithm. One potential explanation for this divergence from the trend is that the S. cerevisiae glycoepitopes are scored based solely on monomeric presentation. That is, the 2G12 binding experiments were performed under conditions in which quaternary interactions may occur, but the S. cerevisiae glycoproteins are scored by the model according to monomeric glycoepitope presentation because no structures of these glycoproteins exist in the proper quaternary biological context. Having defined a model for scoring 2G12 glycoepitopes based on N-glycan site topology, we next apply it to identify viruses with putative 2G12 glycoepitopes in the Protein Data Bank.Predicting putative 2G12 glycoepitopes on novel virusesFinally, we sought to apply our 2G12 glycoepitope model to search for additional viruses that might be bound by 2G12 toward repurposing 2G12 for analytical, diagnostic, or therapeutic purposes. We identified over 1250 viral glycoproteins in the Protein Data Bank and scored them using our 2G12 glycoepitope model (Fig. 4). We obtained a score-percentile distribution in which approximately 40% of viral glycoproteins in the set display a pair of N-glycan sites satisfying the minimal topological constraints for presenting a potential 2G12 glycoepitope if both of these N-glycan sites were occupied by high-mannose N-glycans (Fig. 4A). However, it is unlikely that 2G12 binds these lowest scoring glycoproteins as the lowest scoring glycoproteins do not offer sufficient secondary N-glycan sites to promote high-mannose species at the primary sites or to interact with the secondary 2G12 binding surface. Rather, the lowest experimentally-verified 2G12 binders occur at the 80th score percentile (H5/Viet/04 and YJL171C) and the strongest known binders (EC50 ≤ 0.1 ug/mL) score in the 95th percentile or higher. Further, the 98th and above percentiles contain near exclusively HIV/SIV Env and HIV/SIV constructs (e.g., BG505 and CH505) reflecting the unique degree of N-glycan clustering within the HIV intrinsic mannose patch.Figure 4PDB search for 2G12 repurposing targets. (A) Distribution of 2G12 glycoepitope scores for 1250 + viral glycoproteins in PDB. Each structure analyzed is plotted according to its top scoring 2G12 glycoepitope and ranked against all other glycoproteins in the set. Approximately 60% of viral glycoproteins did not present an N-glycan topology satisfying the minimum criteria of the model. The weakest known 2G12 binding glycoproteins score in the 80th to 90th percentiles and the top scoring glycoproteins are near exclusively HIV/SIV or HIV-derived glycoproteins (e.g., BG505). (B) Top scoring viral glycoproteins. Rows corresponding to known 2G12 binders are highlighted in light blue. *For S. cerevisiae glycoproteins, UniProt accession codes are shown. (C) Three hits with logical mechanisms of neutralization are shown, with the Asn residues for the highest scoring glycoepitope for each glycoprotein shown as red spheres and the putative 2G12 footprint shown as a red dotted oval. Left, the post-fusion glycoprotein B of HCMV features a 96th percentile scoring glycoepitope for which half of the glycoepitope footprint overlaps with a known neutralizing epitope (PDB: 5C6T30, nAb 1G2 shown in blue). Note that the pre-fusion conformation also presents a putative, albeit lower scoring, 2G12 glycoepitope. Middle, the spike protein of PEDV features a number of high-scoring glycoepitopes (96th percentile) that suggest inter- and intra-chain locking (PDB: 6VV531). Right, the receptor binding protein of Sosuga Virus (SosV) features a glycoepitope scoring in the 95th percentile that overlaps with the expected receptor binding site, which is shown in blue (PDB: 6SG832).Full size imageWe therefore defined a set of “hits” as all glycoproteins with scores above the lowest scoring known 2G12 binder (H5/Viet/04) for manual investigation of structures presenting 2G12 glycoepitopes in a plausible biological context (Fig. 4B). During this curation process we eliminated enzymes, non-structural proteins, and glycoepitopes presented proximal to membranes or multimeric interfaces such that 2G12 is unlikely to bind in the context of the full virion. We further moved structures of viruses that do not infect eukaryotic cells and those containing multiple copies of glycoproteins in a non-biologically relevant conformation (e.g., in the crystal lattice). For a number of these hits, including HCMV glycoprotein B, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) spike protein, and Sosuga virus (SosV) receptor binding protein, the predicted 2G12 glycoepitope overlaps known neutralizing antibody epitopes or functionally critical domains and therefore presents a plausible basis for 2G12 neutralization (Fig. 4C). Future investigation is warranted to determine if 2G12 offers diagnostic, analytical, or therapeutic utility for these viruses presenting putative 2G12 glycoepitopes.Discussion2G12 was one of the first identified broadly neutralizing human antibodies directed against the high-mannose glycans of HIV gp12033,34. The unique structure of 2G12 presenting three distinct high-mannose glycan binding surfaces was subsequently described15,18,35. Following recent reports that 2G12 interacts with Influenza H3N2 and SARS-CoV-2, we report results demonstrating that 2G12 binds and functionally inhibits select Influenza A H1N1 viruses and additional H3N2 viruses. Through follow-up work to validate our algorithm, we further observed 2G12 binding to H5 and H7 strains. Further, our results indicate that pairs of N-glycans on the HA head are sufficient to mediate 2G12-HA interactions with H1 HA, which is consistent with the critical role identified by Lee et al., for N165 and N24625 on H3 HA. Yet, our results also indicate that additional glycans beyond a sole pair substantially enhance 2G12 interactions and contribute to more potent neutralization.Additional N-glycans may mediate enhanced effects through a variety of direct and indirect mechanisms. Potential direct effects include glycans proximal to the HA receptor binding site (RBS) interacting directly with the 2G12 paratope, which may favor 2G12 poses that sterically obstruct HA function. Indeed, a variety of 2G12 poses for a given HA are observed by Lee et al.25, suggesting certain N-glycan topologies may more strongly favor certain overhead vs. RBS-proximal poses. On the other hand, the additional N-glycans likely exert an indirect functional effect by modulating glycosylation state at the primary binding site glycans or contributing to glycan network effects such as stabilization. Indeed, Lee et al., present evidence that N165 and N246 are nearly entirely Man9 species, but it was previously unclear whether this effect is dependent on the other H3N2 head glycans or if the pair is sufficiently clustered to induce Man9 alone. Our results demonstrating 2G12 binding to a pair of N-glycans on the HA head of select H1N1 viruses suggest that a lone pair is indeed sufficient to induce high-mannose N-glycosylation and bind 2G12. Still, 2G12 is capable of binding a variety of Man4+ species21, and so our H1N1 results alone do not indicate whether the pair promotes Man9 or other Man4+ species, leaving open the possibility that additional N-glycans on the H3N2 head affect the high-mannose species present at the critical binding pair. Our results further suggest that subtle differences in HA head glycan topology at sites beyond the N165/N246 pair produce substantial effects including a tradeoff between binding and neutralization for H3N2 viruses.Our study has implications in two specific areas. First, our findings have direct relevance to influenza research and drug development efforts. Since inception into human populations, influenza viruses have acquired mutations that add or subtract glycosylation sites, with additions occurring in intervals of about 5 to 7 years36. Interestingly, the introduction of the swine origin 2009 H1N1 virus as the dominant seasonal strain reset the clock on glycosylation sites in the RBS of HA in H1N1 viruses. Compared to previous seasonal strains the 2009 H1N1 lacked glycosylation sites in the RBS of HA resulting in the unmasking of novel antigenic epitopes37. In contrast, despite the identification of triple reassortant H3N2 viruses lacking glycosylation sites in the RBS of HA, these strains haven’t replaced the seasonal virus as the dominant strain and hence the glycosylation clock hasn’t been reset for H3N2 viruses yet. Thus, the HA from seasonal H3N2 viruses since 1968 until 2011 has been accumulating glycosylation sites in the RBS. A recent glycomic analysis demonstrated that these high-mannose N-glycan sites contribute to pathogenicity38. Based on this work, 2G12 may have utility as a diagnostic and analytical tool to monitor the evolution of glycosylation sites in circulating H3N2 viruses. Additionally, given the high neutralization potency of 2G12 against select H3N2 strains, 2G12 might prove useful as a therapeutic. Further, 2G12 should be considered if there is ever a need for a rapid response against an emerging strain with novel N-glycosylation sites proximal to the RBS as 2G12 may potently neutralize such a strain.Second, our approach to define glycoepitope similarity based on structural and geometric considerations goes beyond the conventional definition based on protein sequence similarity and permits identification of novel target epitope surfaces that can be successfully targeted by anti-glycan antibodies on diverse antigens. While until recently 2G12 was the only known antibody recognizing solely N-glycan-based epitopes, an additional structural class of antibodies known as Fab-dimerized glycan-reactive (FDG) antibodies was recently reported39. Further, the set of mutations required to mediate VH domain exchange on the 2G12 scaffold is known40, suggesting the possibility of converting conventional antibodies with glycan-binding domains (e.g., the PGT series16) to domain-exchanged format, potentially mediating enhanced glycan-specific binding. Converted antibodies could be subsequently optimized for interactions with glycoepitopes bearing other glycan species or topologies than those preferred by 2G12 or the FDG antibodies documented to date. Therefore, the approach presented in this study may generalize to guide repurposing of additional anti-glycan antibodies to target topologically similar glycoepitope surfaces on diverse antigens. Further, given recent advances in predicting protein structure from sequence alone41,28 and the application of Alpha Fold 2 to predict and score the structure of S. cerevisiae glycoproteins in this paper which correlated well with measured binding strength, the 2G12 topological model could also be applied to identify novel viral glycoproteins targets for 2G12 from the vast sequence space of emerging viruses.Materials and methodsAntibody expression and purification2G12 variable heavy and light chain were cloned into full length IgG1 expression vector pcDNA3.3 HC and pcDNA3.3 LC. The antibodies were transiently expressed in Freestyle 293 expression system (Invitrogen, CA) and purified using Protein A Sepharose affinity chromatography (Pierce Biotech, GE, UK). The purified antibodies were concentrated, and buffer exchanged into 1× PBS using 30 kDa spin filter columns (Milipore, USA) and quantified using a nanodrop.Enzyme linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA)For ELISA, Maxisorp high-binding 96 well microtiter plates were used to coat the antigen. All steps of the ELISA were performed at room temperature and all volumes used were 100 uL unless otherwise stated. Wells were coated with 50 ng of gp120 JR-FL or 200 ng/well of the various full length HA trimer overnight at 4 °C. Plates were washed three times with 1× PBS/0.05% (vol/vol) Tween 20, blocked for 1 h with 5% Blotto/PBS/0.05% Tween 20 and washed three times with PBS/0.05% Tween 20. Serial dilutions of all antibodies in PBS/0.05% Tween 20 were incubated for 2 h, and the unbound antibody was removed by washing three times as described above. The binding was detected via rabbit anti-human Fcγ HRP conjugate (1:10,000, Jackson Immuno Research, PA) and TMB substrate at 405 nm.VirusesThe following inactive viruses were used in the study. A/Solomon Island/2006 (H1N1) (Meridien Life Sciences), A/New Caledonia/99 (H1N1) (Fitzgerald), and A/Brisbane/2007 (H3N2) (Meridien Life Sciences).Hemagglutination inhibition assayHemagglutination inhibition assays were performed using turkey red blood cells (tRBC; Rockland, cat: R408-0050). Briefly, the pooled and washed 10% tRBC were centrifuged at 1000 rpm to pellet the cells. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was resuspended in 1× PBS. This process was repeated three times and the cells were finally resuspended in 1× PBS to give a final concentration of 2% red blood cells. Twofold serial dilution of the different viruses was incubated with an equal volume of 2% tRBC to determine the HA units for each of the viruses. For the hemagglutination inhibition assay, 4-HA units of each virus was pre-incubated on ice for 45 min with serial dilution of the various antibodies. At the end of the incubation, an equal volume of 2% tRBC was added and incubated on ice for an additional 1 h.In vitro neutralization against select strains2G12 was evaluated against a select set of H3N2 virus strains via a standardized cytopathic effect (CPE) inhibition assay at The Institute for Antiviral Research (IAR) at Utah State University. Briefly, 8 serial dilutions of 2G12 were added to MDCK cells (IAR) infected with the specific H3N2 viruses. PFUs were measured according to cell culture infective dose (CCID50). The ability of 2G12 to prevent formation of CPE was measured 7 days post infection by neutral red uptake assay. In parallel, the toxicity was also determined and the selectivity index (SI) against each virus was calculated.Statistical analysesThe following statistical analyses were used in this study. Figure 1: A nonlinear log(agonist) vs. response curve with four parameters was fit to the observations. The error bars represent standard error of the mean (SEM) across three replicates. The R2 describing goodness of fit is > 0.90 for all curves. Figure 3: Linear regression was performed via the SciPy42 linregress function in Python. The linear regression was evaluated for statistical significance using a Wald test with t-distribution. The null hypothesis was defined as a slope of zero.2G12 glycoepitope-paratope analysisThe 2G12 glycoepitope epitope-paratope analysis was carried out using models of 2G12 bound to HIV (6OZC22) and SARS-CoV-2 (7L0923). Epitope: For each model, 5 canonical N-glycans for each of man4-man9 (from the Glycan Fragment Database27) were docked into each primary binding site using the terminal mannose for alignment. The distribution of possible N-glycan sites giving rise to the array of N-glycan poses was estimated from the position of the terminal GlcNAc. Paratope: For each model, the N-glycan sites interacting with the 2G12 paratope were visualized and annotated in PyMol43 which were then used to construct network models toward building intuition for feature definition. To define the clustering radius of inclusion for secondary N-glycan sites, we analyzed the surface of ER α1,2-mannosidase adjacent to the enzymatic pocket as previously proposed11 (5KIJ29). Validation: Apparent binding constants were estimated according to EC50 for HIV22, SARS-CoV-223, Flu (this study), and S. cerevisiae26 glycoproteins. For H1 and H3 lineages, EC50’s from Fig. 1 were used. For H5 and H7 lineages, EC50s using ELISA as decribed above but with a single replicate (data not shown). For scoring S. cerevisiae glycoproteins, high confidence (90%+) Alpha Fold 228 predicted structures were employed according to Uniprot accession codes P38616, Q12355, P22146, P38248, and P46992. For the other glycoproteins, scores were computed on the following structures: 6AOR44, 4KVN45, 6BKN46, 3LZG47, 5UJZ48, 6V0R49, 6VXX50, 3ZNM51, 4LKI52. Note that the biological assembly was used to populate trimeric HA in cases where the given structure was monomeric. Linear regression was performed via the SciPy42 linregress function in Python.2G12 glycoepitope searchThe Protein Data Bank was first searched for structures annotated as derived from viruses and containing at least three putative N-glycan sites, and all hits were downloaded. For each structure, surface exposure was calculated for all N-glycan sites using a relative surface area (RSA) of 0.2 via the FreeSASA library53 and the theoretical MaxSASA values derived by Tien et al.54. For each surface exposed N-glycan site, the structure was searched for all other surface-exposed N-glycan sites within 60 Å (Feature 1). For each identified pair, all surface-exposed N-glycan sites whose ND2 atoms are within 20 Å of the ND2 atom of a pair-residue were identified and assigned to the nearest pair-residue (Feature 2). Secondary N-glycan sites were weighted from 0.5 to 1 depending on distance from the primary site (Feature 2). Finally, for each structure all glycoepitopes satisfying the minimal constraints were scored and ranked according to the sum of the square roots of the total weighting for both primary binding clusters. Top hits were manually curated for high relevance and feasible biological context. ReferencesDe Filette, M. et al. An influenza A vaccine based on tetrameric ectodomain of matrix protein 2. J. Biol.

Successful Farming's Editorial Guidelines Published on February 15, 2022 Close Photo: NRCS State and federal officials said they would kill infected poultry flocks in Kentucky and Virginia to prevent the spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), a deadly poultry disease. The Agriculture Department reported the new cases on Monday and asked trading partners to minimize the impact on poultry exports if they decide to restrict entry of U.S. chicken meat because of the disease. READ MORE: Another case of deadly poultry virus found in Kentucky In less than a week, the USDA has reported three cases of bird flu, from the Shenandoah Mountains to the Mississippi River. They were the first confirmations of HPAI in U.S. domestic flocks in two years. The disease, which can quickly wipe out a flock, can be costly. Nearly 50 million birds, mostly laying hens and turkeys, died in an epidemic of avian influenza in 2014 and 2015. The new infections were in a flock of broiler chickens, being raised for human consumption, in Fulton County, at the western tip of Kentucky, and in a mixed species backyard flock in Fauquier County in northern Virginia. The first case, reported last Tuesday, was a flock of 29,000 turkeys in Dubois County in southern Indiana. The USDA said it was also testing samples from a turkey flock in Webster County, Kentucky, about 120 miles northeast of Fulton County. "We are working diligently to prevent this virus from spreading to other poultry premises," said Kentucky state veterinarian Katie Flynn. State officials quarantined the affected farms and said they would monitor poultry farms that are within 10 kilometers (6 miles) of them. The USDA said "depopulation" of the backyard flock in Virginia was complete and the Kentucky flock also would be culled. The USDA said it will limit its public notification of HPAI cases to the first case in a state. Subsequent detections will be listed on an Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service site. As of Monday, the site listed the three cases in domestic flocks and 139 infections in wild birds in seven states along the Atlantic coast from Florida to New Hampshire this year. A USDA spokesperson was not immediately available to explain why USDA decided to announce only the first case in a state. In the 2014-15 epidemic, some states had dozens of outbreaks. China and South Korea limited purchases of poultry meat from Indiana following the discovery of HPAI in the turkey flock there, reported Reuters. Last week, the USDA estimated nearly 1 of every 6 pounds of U.S. broiler production would be exported this year. Poultry exports were worth $5.25 billion last year. "Any detection of HPAI in poultry in the United States is a concern and the industry remains on high alert," said the trade group National Chicken Council. "But the United States has the most robust monitoring and surveillance program in the world — and detailed plans are in place to control spreading among flocks and eliminate the virus completely. All U.S. flocks are tested year-round for avian influenza." Last week, the USDA said it would expand wild bird surveillance for avian influenza to the Mississippi and Central Flyways and enlarge its surveillance of the Atlantic and Pacific Flyways, where it monitors birds that may interact with European or Asian fowl. "In addition to practicing good biosecurity, all bird owners should prevent contact between their birds and wild birds and report sick birds or unusual bird deaths" to their state veterinarian or to APHIS, said the USDA. The leading states for broiler chicken production are Georgia, North Carolina, Arkansas, Alabama, Mississippi, and Texas. The top states for turkey production are North Carolina, Minnesota, Indiana, Arkansas, and Missouri. The APHIS list of bird flu outbreaks is available here. Was this page helpful?

A recent study published in the Journal of Brain, Behavior, and Immunity found that active adults who exercised for 90 minutes post-vaccine had increased serum antibodies, yet no increase in negative side effects after the initial dose of influenza and Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine.To get to the results, senior author and principal investigator, Marian Kohut, Ph.D., professor of kinesiology at Iowa State University, and her team studied groups of participants immediately following their first immunization. They collected blood samples of the COVID-19 group prior to immunization, two weeks after the first dose, and one week after the second dose. In the flu study, the researchers also collected blood samples pre-immunization, and both two and four weeks post jab. For the flu vaccine group, researchers asked participants to either exercise for 45 minutes, 90 minutes, or not exercise at all immediately following immunization. The COVID-19 vaccine group exercised for 90 minutes or not at all. Based on the blood samples, the researchers found that 90 minutes of exercise outdoors consistently increased serum antibodies (an essential component of your immune system that helps keep you from getting sick from these illnesses) for up to four weeks after immunization. Join Runner's World+ for unlimited access to the best training tips for runnersThe majority of participants (78 total) completed the workout (running or walking) at 60 to 70 percent of their maximum heart rate, which also correlated to heart rates of about 120 to 140 beats per minute. “Based on the data we have, it appears that as long as individuals are in the 60 to 70 percent of the age-based estimate of max heart rate, we see the same benefit [of increased antibodies],” Kohut says. Researchers also asked participants to record their side effects for three days following the vaccines, and there were no differences in outcomes between exercisers and non-exercisers.Time and effort matter—not distanceParticipants in the study who exercised for 45 minutes post-vaccine did not see an increase in antibodies after two and four weeks—those benefits only showed up in those who worked out for 90 minutes. And researchers did not find a significant correlation between distance covered and antibody response in those who exercised for 90 minutes. The distance covered ranged from four to 10 miles, so no matter how far someone ran (or walked), as long as they hit the 90-minute mark, they still experienced an increase in serum antibodies. According to the study, the 45-minute workout wasn’t enough time to increase antibody production. “Our finding that just a single session of exercise performed after immunization could significantly impact antibody response to the vaccine was very interesting, and people with a wide range of fitness levels (all regular exercisers) were able to complete the 90 minutes of exercise,” Kohut says.Related Story10 Strength Training Exercises for RunnersThough the study was small—42 participants were enrolled in the flu study and 36 in the COVID-19 study—researchers believe it makes a strong case for breaking a sweat after your shot. “Based on the evidence we have to date, sticking with 90 minutes of light-to moderate-intensity exercise commencing shortly after immunization seems to be effective across different vaccine platforms,” Kohut says.One thing to remember if you’re considering working out after your shot: If you have a fever, experience lightheadedness, or generally don’t feel well, don’t push yourself to start or continue to exercise. Listen to your body and rest when you need it. Related StoryMore Health in the NewsWhy does the increase in antibodies occur post-exercise?A few processes may be at work that affects the immune response from exercise. “It’s not likely to be a single mechanism responsible for the increase in antibodies,” Kohut says. “Exercise for 90 minutes is accompanied by metabolic, neuroendocrine, and circulatory changes, each of which may contribute to altered immune response.” In other words, it appears many changes are happening in the systems that control the metabolism, hormones, and bloodstream during 90 minutes of exercise. She adds, “with this understanding, we may learn how to improve vaccine efficacy, define the parameters of exercise that are required to improve immune response, and learn whether other types of health practices (yoga, meditation, massage, for example) could have similar benefits.” Previous research also helps to explain how running supports the immune system in both the short and long-term. For example, it encourages a healthy anti-inflammatory environment and increases the number of immune cells out looking to fight infection in the bloodstream. And because of those immune system responses to exercise, older research published in 2014 also supports the idea that those who live an active lifestyle may respond better to vaccines.Related StoryHow Daily Exercise Can Boost Your Immune SystemMore research is still neededKohut and her team tested the participants as far as four weeks post-immunization, but she acknowledges the need to understand the long-term benefits of exercise on vaccine effectiveness. Whether or not the increase of antibodies will extend six months (the current recommended timeframe for getting your booster) is still unknown. “It would be interesting to understand how the increase in antibody extends to actual protection, although these types of studies typically require quite a large number of participants,” Kohut says. “Although one may assume the higher antibody level would translate to better vaccine efficacy in terms of preventing infection, that remains to be determined. Ongoing studies by many researchers are attempting to define the optimal level of antibodies that results in protection.” Finally, Kohut cautions that study participants all exercised regularly prior to the study, and it is not yet known if the same benefit of increased antibodies would apply to non-exercisers. Exercise post-vaccine could potentially pose safety risks for those that lead a sedentary lifestyle.When asked if exercise alone can improve protection from infection without a vaccine, Kohut says, “It is important to understand that the immune system must ‘see’ the virus components to create immune memory (memory consists of the antibodies, the B cells that make the antibodies and T cells). Exercise alone cannot create this immune memory.” While this research doesn’t 100 percent confirm that you should clock a 90-minute run right after getting your flu or COVID-19 shot, it does offer more evidence to support lacing up and hitting the pavement to improve your health.Jennifer AckerJennifer Acker reports on a wide range of health and wellness topics for Runner’s World and Bicycling.

The money will be spent on a state-of-the-art revamp of the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) scientific laboratories at Weybridge – enhancing the UK’s already world-leading scientific and veterinary capability. Weybridge is renowned for its specialist research and laboratory facilities, and its animal health science and disease control capabilities – with a focus on tackling and eradicating high-risk animal diseases. APHA is responsible for safeguarding animal and plant health. It was integral in controlling the devastating outbreaks of Foot and Mouth Disease in 2001, and is currently tasked with tackling the largest Avian Influenza outbreak on record. The outbreak of Covid-19, a zoonotic disease, has reiterated the importance of boosting our resilience to help prevent future pandemics. New equipment and specialist testing facilities will mean APHA scientists can identify pathogens for existing and emerging threats posed by diseases spread by animals, and maintain our high biosecurity standards against Bovine TB, Salmonella and avian flu. Research at Weybridge has paved the way for field trials of a TB cattle vaccine which if successful will enable farmers to vaccinate their animals against this deadly disease. APHA are also playing an essential role in tackling the largest outbreak of avian flu on record, supporting the rapid response to try to limit its spread and ensuring that the poultry industry is able to continue to operate. This investment in facilities will further enable Weybridge scientists to quickly sample, analyse and confirm the presence of bird flu in a location so APHA can act fast to tackle the threat. Alongside these existing threats, the UK must be prepared for future risks from animal diseases which could pose a significant risk to UK farming and wildlife including African Swine Fever. This investment will offer APHA greater capacity to track diseases of concern across the globe and conduct research into a growing number of high-risk threats in advanced high-containment laboratories. As well as protecting animal health and the wider public, a strong animal health science capability is crucial to protect the industries that rely on exporting animal and animal by-products, which were estimated to be in excess of £12 billion in 2019. This investment will enhance the UK’s international reputation as a safe agri-food trading partner. Defra Biosecurity Minister Lord Benyon said: The UK is a world leader when it comes to science and biosecurity. I have seen for myself the remarkable work done by APHA in responding to the recent outbreak of Avian Influenza, and in paving the way for field trials of a cattle vaccine against Bovine Tuberculosis. This investment builds on a long-term programme to future-proof our animal health capabilities, and ensure that we are at the forefront of defence against future pandemics. DEFRA Chief Scientific Advisor Gideon Henderson said: The Animal and Plant Health Agency provides top-quality scientific expertise and capability for the critical job of protecting the UK’s animals, plant, and people from health risk. The importance of APHA’s work for society and for the UK economy is shown again and again; witness their work on the present avian influenza outbreak, and the global Covid pandemic - a zoonotic disease. This substantial investment in APHA’s capability recognises the essential role of this government laboratory, and will enable its excellent scientists to continue at the forefront of research and policy to protect the country, boosting our resilience and strengthening our understanding of health risks to, and from, animals and plants”. UK Chief Veterinary Officer Christine Middlemiss said: Fast, reliable testing and world class animal disease surveillance is vital in halting the spread of animals diseases and mitigating the risk of pandemics. This investment ensures APHA can continue its critical role in animal health science and help stop the spread of disease. APHA Chief Executive Ian Hewett said: As the National Reference Laboratory for 48 animal diseases and an International Reference Laboratory for further 23 diseases, APHA’s Weybridge science facility provides international assurance in the UK’s biosecurity capability to protect the health of animals and people, and underpin trade relations. As a result of this funding, work is already underway to transform the campus, paving the way for a future science hub which supports our international reputation as experts in animal science and well-prepared national disease control. The investment confirmed today will also enhance the capacity of the site to allow scientists to manage concurrent outbreaks and conduct research in parallel. This will help to control and eradicate animal and plant diseases and pests whilst reducing the risks from new and emerging threats.

TOKYO -- A biopharmaceutical company is seeking approval in Canada for the world's first plant-based COVID-19 vaccine, sparking hopes for mass production in the near term. The vaccine employs the mechanism of having plants create virus-like particles, which are extracted from the crops grown in greenhouses and presented as antigens. If the plant-derived vaccine for human use, currently under research and development by Medicago Inc., a Canadian subsidiary of Japan's Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corp., is put to practical use, it will be the world's first such vaccine. The final phase of clinical trials was finished last year in six countries, and according to the firm, their results showed the vaccine had 71% efficacy. In Canada, the company filed an application in December for the vaccine's authorization, and aims to start distribution by the end of March. Clinical trials are also being carried out in Japan. There are plans to file an application for pharmaceutical approval with Japan's Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare this spring, with the goal of putting the vaccines to practical use within fiscal 2022. Vaccines contain pathogens, parts of them or other substances to induce an immune response against infectious diseases in the body. Medicago's vaccine is one type of VLP vaccine, which administers virus-like particles (VLPs) to the human body as antigens. The VLPs, created through the genetic engineering of organisms, have an external structure mimicking that of viruses, as well as an identical size. Hen's eggs, E. coli bacteria and insect cells, among other objects, have been used to manufacture VLP vaccines. The new attempt aims to make use of plant-based VLPs. Viruses have a basic structure of DNA or RNA, constituting genetic information, surrounded by a protein shell. The coronavirus and influenza virus have a lipid membrane as its external layer, or viral envelope, and spike proteins protrude from them. As VLPs' size and external structure are almost identical to that of viruses, they are promising as highly effective vaccine antigens. Meanwhile, as they do not hold genetic material inside, there are no concerns of viruses proliferating in the body after vaccination. This VLP vaccine technology has already been used for HPV, which is a cause of cervical cancer, by using insect cells and yeast. VLPs are created from plants by using Nicotiana benthamiana plants, a species that is a close relative of tobacco and has quick growth. The genetic information of coronavirus spike proteins is implemented into the plants and a temporary genetic engineering takes place. The genetic information is then decoded within the leaves' cells, creating protein that accumulate as VLPs. Following cultivation of around one week, the leaves are harvested, VLPs are extracted from them, and purified to create the final material used in vaccines. As manufacturing takes place in large-scale plant factories, it is said that the vaccines can be mass-produced within a short period of time, and that they can be stored and transported in a state of refrigeration (between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius). While messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines, which were put to practical use for the first time amid the spread of the coronavirus, require storage at ultra-low freezing temperatures, the plant-based vaccine has the advantage of being easy to handle. The manufacturing technology of plant-based vaccines also has the potential to be utilized in various fields by changing the genetic code of plants. Medicago has also set about research and development of vaccines for seasonal influenza, as well as the stomach flu-inducing rotavirus and norovirus. By taking advantage of plants' fast growth, it's hoped that plant-based vaccines can become a quick-response option for fighting pandemics. The technology is reportedly beginning to be introduced to deal with the global spread of the omicron variant.
