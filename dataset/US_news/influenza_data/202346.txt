These viruses spread naturally among wild aquatic birds worldwide and infect domestic poultry, other birds, and other animal species. Currently, real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) is mainly used to detect the presence of pathogens and has good sensitivity and specificity. However, the diagnosis requires sophisticated instruments under laboratory conditions, which significantly limits point-of-care testing (POCT). Rapid, reliable, non-lab-equipment-reliant, sensitive, and specific diagnostic tests are urgently needed for rapid clinical detection and diagnosis. Our study aimed to develop a reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA)/CRISPR method which improves on these limitations.MethodsThe Cas12a protein was purified by affinity chromatography with Ni-agarose resin and observed using sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Specific CRISPR RNA (crRNA) and primers targeting the M and NP genes of the AIV were designed and screened. By combining RT-RPA with the Cas12a/crRNA trans-cleavage system, a detection system that uses fluorescence readouts under blue light or lateral flow strips was established. Sensitivity assays were performed using a tenfold dilution series of plasmids and RNA of the M and NP genes as templates. The specificity of this method was determined using H1–H16 subtype AIVs and other avian pathogens, such as newcastle disease virus (NDV), infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV), and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV).ResultsThe results showed that the method was able to detect AIV and that the detection limit can reach 6.7 copies/μL and 12 copies/μL for the M and NP gene, respectively. In addition, this assay showed no cross-reactivity with other avian-derived RNA viruses such as NDV, IBDV, and IBV. Moreover, the detection system presented 97.5% consistency and agreement with rRT-PCR and virus isolation for detecting samples from poultry. This portable and accurate method has great potential for AIV detection in the field.ConclusionAn RT-RPA/CRISPR method was developed for rapid, sensitive detection of AIV. The new system presents a good potential as an accurate, user-friendly, and inexpensive platform for point-of-care testing applications. BackgroundAvian influenza (AI) is a syndrome caused by avian influenza viruses (AIVs) that infect poultry and wild birds. According to different clinical symptoms, AI can be divided into low-pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) and highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). AIV is an enveloped, segmented, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus belonging to the family Orthomyxoviridae and the genus Influenza virus A [1, 2]. According to the surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), AIVs can be classified into 16 HA and 9 NA subtypes [3, 4]. Perroncito first reported HPAI or fowl plague in 1878; since then, there have been several outbreaks worldwide, posing a great threat to the breeding industry and human health [5]. Since 2005, more than 25,000 HPAI outbreaks have occurred worldwide (https://www.woah.org/en/). Wild birds, particularly waterfowl, are natural reservoirs of all AIV subtypes, making it difficult to control the transmission of AIV [6].Currently, the main methods commonly used for AIV detection include hemagglutination assay, hemagglutination inhibition [7], reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) [8]. Existing nucleic acid detection methods, such as rRT-PCR, have good sensitivity and specificity but require expensive laboratory instruments and well-trained personnel, which greatly hinders the application of this method for point-of-care testing (POCT).Recently, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat sequences and associated nuclease (CRISPR-Cas) systems have provided potential applications for rapid and sensitive molecular diagnostics [9,10,11]. The CRISPR-Cas system is an RNA-guided adaptive immune system that protects bacteria and archaea from invasion by foreign nucleic acids [12,13,14]. Some Cas nucleases, such as Cas12a, Cas12b, Cas13a, Cas13b, and Cas14, exert their collateral cleavage activity after recognizing specific target sequences for nucleic acid detection for diagnostic purposes [15, 16]. For example, when the Cas12a nuclease recognizes a T-rich protospacer-adjacent motif and cleaves double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) specifically at the target site guided by sequence-specific crRNA, the activated Cas nuclease indiscriminately cleaves nearby single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) labeled with quenched fluorescence or biotin. The results are displayed by fluorescent readers or lateral flow chromatography test strips (Fig. 1) [17, 18]. Nucleic acid detection technology based on the CRISPR-Cas system has been successfully applied to several highly pathogenic viruses, such as the zika virus, dengue virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [19], human papillomavirus, and AIV [9, 20, 21]. However, because Cas12a itself is not theoretically sensitive enough to detect lower levels of nucleic acids, the detection of CRISPR-Cas12a is usually combined with an isothermal amplification step such as RPA to improve its sensitivity [22, 23]. RPA is considered one of the nucleic acid amplification techniques used for molecular diagnostics, with the ability to amplify nucleic acids at the 37–42 °C temperature range for sensitive and rapid nucleic acid amplification [24]. Existing studies have confirmed that the Cas12a nuclease combined with the RPA method shows single-molecule sensitivity in a given reaction [9, 15].Fig. 1Schematic diagram of the RT/RPA assay coupled with the CRISPR-mediated detection platform for identification of AIV. Target genes are specifically amplified by RT-RPA from genomic fragments isolated from clinical samples. A specific crRNA is designed to recognize the target gene and form a complex with Cas12a and the probe. Once the target DNA is recognized by the Cas12a and crRNA complex, Cas12a exerts its non-specific endonuclease activity and cleaves the single-stranded DNA probe. By introducing a ssDNA probe that labels the fluorophore and quencher or fluorophore and biotin, the cleavage could be observed using a fluorophore reader or lateral flow dipstickFull size imageIn this study, a visual detection method using CRISPR-Cas12a for rapid nucleic acid detection of AIV was developed. After sample processing, by combining RT-RPA technology with the CRISPR-Cas12a system for detection, the sample can be presented in 1 h by a fluorescence reader or the naked eye. Because no sophisticated laboratory instrumentation is required, this method is useful for POCT of AIV and helps control the spread of the disease.Materials and methodsMaterialsEscherichia coli strains expressing the LbCas12a protein, plasmids containing the AIV M and NP genes, and H1–H16 subtypes of AIV, newcastle disease virus (NDV), infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV), and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) were conserved in the State Key Laboratory of Harbin Veterinary Research Institute (HVRI), Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (CAAS). A total of 81 samples were obtained from the National Reference Laboratory for Avian Influenza.Reagents and instrumentsRNase inhibitors were obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientific. The crRNA targeting the RT-RPA of the M and NP genes was synthesized by RuiBiotech. RNA was extracted using a TIANamp Virus RNA Kit. A HiScribe T7 Quick High-Yield RNA Synthesis Kit was purchased from New England Biolabs. The single-stranded DNA reporter was synthesized by Sangon Biotech. The HybriDetect test dipstick was purchased from Warbio. The RNA Rapid Concentration Purification Kit was purchased from Sangon Biotech. Fluorescence signals were acquired using QuantStudio 5 (Applied Biosystems) and the degraded fluorescent reporter group (ssDNA-FQ) was visualized under UV light.Template RNA preparationPlasmids containing the M and NP genes from AIV were PCR-amplified using primers containing T7 promoter sequences and then purified using a PCR Product Purification Kit. The purified DNA products were used as templates for in vitro transcription reactions using the HiScribe T7 Quick High Yield RNA Synthesis Kit, and RNA was purified using the RNA Rapid Concentration Purification Kit.Protein expression and purificationLbCas12a protein used for AIV detection was expressed in E. coli. The gene encoding LbCas12a was cloned into a pET-based expression vector containing a C-terminal 6 × His-tag and a TEV protease cleavage site. The soluble protein was purified as previously described with the following modifications: the bacterial expression plasmid was transformed into RosettaTM2(DE3) cells, and a 10 mL bacterial culture was grown in 1 L Luria–Bertani growth media which was inoculated for growth at 37 °C and 200 RPM until an OD600 of 0.6. Meanwhile, LbCas12a protein expression was induced by supplementation with isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.5 mM, and the cell was cooled to 16 °C for 18 h. Bacterial cells were harvested, resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.2, 2 M NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, 2 mL PMSF, and 0.25 mg/mL lysozyme), disrupted by sonication, and purified using an Ni–NTA column. The purified protein was added to TEV enzyme to remove the His-tag and concentrated through an ultrafiltration tube to obtain the purified LbCas12a protein, which was stored at -80 °C or used directly in the assay.Optimization of RT-RPA and Cas12a detectionRNase H is an endonuclease that specifically hydrolyzes RNA strands in RNA-cDNA hybrids. In RT-RPA, viral RNA is reverse transcribed into cDNA or cDNA-RNA hybrids using reverse transcriptase, which helps to improve amplification efficiency [25]. To obtain the best amplification, different concentrations of RNase H were added to the RT-RPA reaction, and the amplification products were detected for Cas12a by reading the fluorescence signal to determine the optimal concentration.To establish the optimal reaction conditions for Cas12a detection, the influence of different factors, including pH, ssDNA reporter, buffer composition, Mg2+, and crRNA concentration, on Cas12a cleavage efficiency was investigated.Design and screening for crRNA and primers of RT-RPABased on the conserved sequences of the M and NP genes of AIV, four M-crRNAs and four NP-crRNAs were designed and screened for the best crRNA. Based on the selected crRNA, RT-RPA primers targeting the M and NP genes of AIV were designed as described for Twist-Dx (Maidenhead, United Kingdom). To screen the best pairs, a random combination of primers was used to screen the primer pairs with the most efficient amplification effects, as shown in Table 1. Primer pairs with the most efficient performance were used in subsequent experiments.Table 1 Oligonucleotides used in this experimentFull size tableRT-RPA reactionRT-RPA reactions were performed using a RT-Basic RNA isothermal rapid amplification kit (Genenode, Wuhan, China) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. In brief, the reactions were performed at a total volume of 50 μL comprising RT-RPA enzymes, 2 μL RNA input, 29.4 μL A Buffer, 2 μL Forward primer (10 μM), 2 μL Reverse primer (10 μM), and 2.5 μL B Buffer. All reactions were incubated at 42 °C for 30 min in a PCR instrument or metal bath.Cas12a detection reactionsDetection assays were performed with 10 μL RT-RPA products or 1 μL dsDNA plasmid, 1.25 μL purified Cas12a protein, 12.5 μL reaction Buffer (20 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 5% glycerol), 1 μL crRNA (200 nM), 0.25 μL RNase inhibitor (RI), 1 μL ssDNA reporter, and water to make up a total volume of 25 μL. Reactions were incubated in a Real-Time PCR Detection System (ABI QuantStudio 5) or a fluorescence plate reader (Enspire, USA) for 1–2 h at 37 °C with fluorescence signals measured every 5 min.Lateral flow detectionAfter amplification was completed, 2 μL of amplification product was mixed with 25 μL reaction buffer, 2.5 μL LbCas12a, 2 μL crRNA, 2 μL probe (FAM-TTATT-Biotin), 0.5 μL RI, and 16 μL ddH2O, and given at 37 °C for 2 h. A side-flow test strip was then added to the reaction tube and the results were observed after 2 min. A single band near the sample pad indicated a negative result, whereas a single band or two bands near the top of the test strip indicated a positive result.rRT-PCR assay for AIV testingrRT-PCR detection of the AIV-M gene was performed using the QuantStudio 5 system according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Guanmu Biotechnology, Hunan, China). In brief, single-tube PCRs were prepared including 19 μL reaction buffer, 1 μL enzyme mixture, and 5 μL RNA template. The amplification program was reverse transcription at 50 °C for 2 min, pre-denaturation at 95 °C for 2 min, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 15 s and annealing and extension at 60 °C for 30 s. Fluorescence signals were collected during the annealing and extension steps per cycle.Statistical analysisThe data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 8.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc.) for analysis of variance. Data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation of three independent experiments.ResultsProtein purification and verification of Cas12a protein activitySodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was performed on the bacterial pellet (before and after induction), supernatant, flow-through solutions, washing solutions, eluent, and proteins after digestion with the TEV enzyme (Fig. 2). The molecular weight of the original LbCas12a protein was 192.1 kDa. The actual protein size of LbCas12a after excision of the tag using the TEV enzyme was 143.7 kDa. According to the SDS-PAGE results, the Cas12a protein was highly expressed.Fig. 2SDS-PAGE gel plots of each sample of Cas12a. A: LbCas12a protein purification graph.

The results showed that the cleavage efficiency of Cas12a was highest when RNase H nuclease, 0.5 mM Mg2+, pH 7, and 200 nM crRNA were used.Fig. 3Optimization of the RT-RPA and CRISPR/Cas12a system. a Cleavage effect of reaction buffers with different Mg2+ concentrations on the CRISPR/Cas12a assay. b Cleavage effect of different dilution concentrations of crRNA on Cas12a protein cleavage efficiency. c Cleavage effect of reaction buffers with different pH values on the CRISPR/Cas12a assay. d Effect of RNase H nuclease on RT-RPA assaysFull size imageScreening of crRNA and primersFour crRNA sequences were identified based on the conserved sequences of the AIV M and NP genes, and the best crRNA sequences were determined using the fluorescence method. The results showed that M-crRNA-4 (Fig. 4a) and NP-crRNA-1 (Fig. 4c) had better effects, and the screened crRNAs were used in subsequent experiments.Fig. 4Design and screening of crRNA and RPA primers. a Cleavage activity of CRISPR/Cas12a induced by four crRNAs targeting the AIV M gene, b primer screening for the M gene, c cleavage activity of CRISPR/Cas12a induced by four crRNAs targeting the AIV NP gene, and d primer screening for the NP gene. A comprehensive screen using a random combination of primers was used to identify the primer pairs with the best performance. Fluorescence signals were collected using the QuantStudio software (Applied Biosystems)Full size imageBecause the sequences of the amplification primers are critical for RPA, primers must be screened to determine the best detection. For each reaction, nine primer pairs targeting M (Fig. 4b) and NP genes (Fig. 4d) were tested using 1.17 × 1012 copies/μL virus RNA as templates, and the best primer pairs (F1/R3) and (F3/R3) were identified for subsequent experiments.Sensitivity and specificity testsTo determine the analytical sensitivity of this system, the M and NP plasmids and RNA were used as templates for detection. The CRISPR/Cas12a system was able to detect a sensitivity of 2.4 × 108 copies/μL and 8.67 × 108 copies/μL using plasmids including M and NP genes as templates, respectively, at tenfold serial diluted concentrations (Fig. 5a–f). Next, tenfold serial dilutions of AIV RNA were used as templates for the detection of the M and NP genes (Fig. 5g–n). RT-RPA amplification was performed for the M and NP genes and the amplified products were examined using CRISPR/Cas12a. The results showed that after combining RT-RPA, the sensitivity of CRISPR/Cas12a detection could reach 6.7 copies/μL and 12 copies/μL.Fig. 5Sensitivity analysis. a, c, e Ten-fold serial dilutions of plasmid template targeting the M gene at 2.4 × 1011 copies/µl for the sensitivity assay; b, d, f tenfold serial dilutions of plasmid template targeting the NP gene at 8.67 × 1011 copies/µl for the sensitivity assay; (M:11–4, 2.4 × 1011 copies/µl–2.4 × 104 copies/µl; NP:11–4, 8.67 × 1011 copies/µl–8.67 × 104 copies/µl); g, h, i, m tenfold serial dilutions of RNA template targeting M gene at 6.7 × 1011 copies/μL for the sensitivity assay by RT-RPA/CRISPR; i, k, l, n tenfold serial dilutions of RNA template targeting NP gene at 12 × 1011 copies/μL for the sensitivity assay by RT-RPA/CRISPR. (M:11–0, 6.7 × 1011 copies/µl–6.7 × 100 copies/µl; NP:11–0, 12 × 1011 copies/µl–12 × 100 copies/µl). Fluorescent signals were collected every 5 min and displayed for 2 h and 30 min, respectivelyFull size imageIn this experiment, RT-RPA/CRISPR was performed using the M and NP (Fig. 6a–f) genes of the H1-H16 subtypes of AIV as templates, and the results showed that this method was able to successfully detect 16 HA subtypes of AIV and determine the reliability of the assay. In addition, to examine the specificity of RT/RPA-CRISPR for AIV detection, the established assay was used to detect other avian pathogens, including NDV, IBV, and IBDV (Fig. 6g–l). The results showed that all tested avian pathogens were negative except AIV, which was positive, indicating that this method is highly specific for the detection of AIV.Fig. 6Specificity analysis. RNA of AIVs, IBDV, NDV, and IBV were used as templates for RT-RPA/CRISPR specificity; a, c, e the RNA of 16 HA subtypes of AIV was used as templates, the M gene was targeted for RT-RPA/CRISPR sensitivity detection; b, d, f the RNA of 16 HA subtypes of AIV was used as templates, the NP gene was targeted for RT-RPA/CRISPR sensitivity detection; g, i, k specificity assay with the M gene as target; h, j, l specificity assay with the NP gene as targetFull size imageAssessment of RT-RPA/CRISPR assays from avian clinical samples for consistency with commercial rRT-PCR kitsTo assess the performance of the RT/RPA-CRISPR assay, 81 clinical samples, including swabs and lungs, were analyzed using both RT/RPA-CRISPR and a commercial rRT-PCR assay, as shown in Table 2.Table 2 The performance of RT/RPA-CRISPR for AIV detection in clinical samples compared with real-time RT-PCRFull size tableDiscussionTo date, the prevalence of AIV in most countries worldwide has caused serious socioeconomic impact, restricting the trade of poultry products, affecting food safety, and posing a great health threat to humans [26, 27]. Currently, the main molecular diagnostic test for AIV is rRT-PCR, which has the advantages of high sensitivity and short turnaround time [28], but requires expensive instruments and professional operating personnel; therefore, it is inconvenient for POCT. In this study, a simple and sensitive RT-RPA method coupled with CRISPR/Cas12a was developed for rapid AIV detection.Notably, off-target and mismatch recognition effects could be major concerns in CRISPR/Cas12a-mediated nucleic acid tests. To solve these problems, four crRNAs each targeting the conserved sequences of the M and NP genes of AIV were designed and synthesized by screening and comparing the target sequences. Although the RPA technique has been successfully applied for the detection of many pathogens because of its high sensitivity and efficiency [29, 30], it suffers from some intrinsic drawbacks, such as the issue of detection of RPA products, design rules, result determination of primers and probes, and the current lack of software for designing RPA primers. Therefore, in this study, primers were rigorously designed to achieve better amplification of the conserved target sequence.The ability of the RT/RPA-CRISPR method to detect AIV has been demonstrated. The CRISPR/Cas12a-mediated nucleic test fluorescence reporter system achieved a sensitivity level of 2.4 × 108 copies/μL without RT-RPA. In combination with RT-RPA amplification, the RT/RPA-CRISPR test detected RNA targets at a sensitivity level of 6.7 copies/μL and 12 copies/μL targeting the M and NP genes respectively. The crude extraction method (high-temperature or lysis buffer) can be used in the field with slightly decreased sensitivity, and further research is needed to develop a more suitable and optimized extraction method to meet the needs of on-site sample detection.Visual detection is crucial for nucleic acid diagnosis, particularly in the absence of experimental instrumentation. In this study, a reporter labeled with FAM on the 5′ end and BHQ1 on the 3′ end was used. After Cas12a protein cleavage, green signals were observed with the naked eye under UV irradiation when the target was present. With the method, a detection sensitivity of 6.7 copies/μL was achieved, which is comparable with the fluorescence plate reader method. In addition, another reporter labeled with FAM molecules at the 5′ end and biotin at the 3′ end was developed. When bound to lateral flow strips, the disruption of the reporter was visible to the naked eye. This method exhibited slightly lower analytical sensitivity to the template than the fluorometric method because of the influence of the strip itself [31].Next, the sensitivity of the RT-PCR/CRISPR assay was compared with that of the rRT-PCR and RT/RPA-only methods. These results indicate that RT-RPA/CRISPR can be detected with a somewhat higher sensitivity than real-time fluorescent RT-PCR and RT-RPA-only detection methods, an observation that may be attributed to the signal amplification effect induced by the trans-cleavage activity of Cas12a.In summary, an RT-RPA/CRISPR-Cas12a method was developed for the rapid and sensitive detection of AIV. By combining the lateral flow strips and RT-RPA/CRISPR-Cas12a, this detection system has several advantages, including high sensitivity, low reliance on sophisticated instruments and trained specialists, short assay time, ease of operation, cost-effectiveness, and enhanced testing accuracy [32]. The new system has strong potential as an accurate, user-friendly, and inexpensive platform for point-of-care testing applications in CRISPR-based diagnostics.

Active duty patients can receive their vaccination in the WHASC atrium, located between the C and D wings, on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m., and on Wednesday from 9:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. Due to the holidays, hours of operation on Nov. 22, from 9 a.m. to noon and will be closed on Nov. 23 and 24. Influenza has the potential to delay mission readiness. Vaccination can significantly reduce influenza illnesses, doctors’ visits, missed work attendance, and prevent flu-related hospitalizations. “It is an all-hands-on-deck task, and Airmen have stepped up for their units to ensure we surpass the Department of Defense’s 90-percent vaccination goal,” explained Master Sgt. Evans Opoku, 59th Medical Specialty Squadron Allergy and Immunizations flight chief. Airmen from multiple clinics and specialties have volunteered to complete the mission. “It has been a collaborative effort across three groups: the 59th Medical Operations Group, 59th Medical Support Group, and 59th Dental Group,” said Opoku. “Maintaining readiness is crucial for both our service members and beneficiaries, ensuring they stay up to date with their flu shots to protect against influenza and potential complications.” Medical technicians, registered nurses, and dental providers are working as vaccinators, while dental technicians and assistants are handling manpower screening, patient check-in and out, and directing the vaccine line. “I’m volunteering to contribute to the readiness of our service members,” said Airman Cyerra Caldwell, 59th Dental Training Squadron dental assistant. “I’m also excited to be here because I love meeting new people and being able to work with them.” Airmen are dedicated to the mission and see this as an opportunity to build teamwork. Staff Sgt. Anna Regina Claro, 59th Medical Specialty Squadron medical technician, is working as a vaccinator for the vaccine line and has just returned from deployment to a new team. “I’m happy for this great opportunity to work with a new team and build new professional relationships,” expressed Claro. “We need to vaccinate to ensure no outbreaks occur. Active duty is a priority because we’re the ones deploying and have missions to go on, and we can’t accomplish the mission if exposed to illnesses and diseases.” All other beneficiaries, 6 months and older, can receive their influenza vaccine by appointment only at the WHASC Allergy and Immunizations Clinic on the third floor in D-wing on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m., and on Wednesday from 9:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. The line will have special holiday hours on Nov. 22, 2023, from 8 a.m. to noon and will be closed on Nov. 23 and 24, 2023. The Pediatrics Clinic also offers the flu vaccine during well-child exams. Beneficiaries may also receive CDC-recommended vaccines at no cost at participating network pharmacies. To locate available network pharmacies, visit https://militaryrx.express-scripts.com/find-pharmacy or call 1-877-363-1303. To schedule an appointment to receive the influenza vaccine, call the Consult and Appointment Management Office at 210-916-9900 or book online via the MHS GENESIS Patient Portal.

Covering the week ending November 4, the report said outpatient visits for respiratory illnesses are now at the national baseline of 2.9%. PeopleImages/iStock The south central and southeastern regions, where flu activity often rises ahead of the rest of the country, are above their regional baselines, while activity in the western region has risen to its baseline. Outpatient visits are rising for all age-groups but are highest in children ages 4 and younger. Test positivity is highest in the southern regions, with levels in other regions stable but trending upward, the CDC said. The CDC said four jurisdictions are reporting high flu activity, another marker of outpatient visits for flulike illness. Puerto Rico is one of the hot spots. Last week, the territory's health department declared an influenza epidemic, its first since 2016, according to a statement translated and posted by Avian Flu Diary, an infectious disease news blog. According to CDC data, the three others are Alaska, New Mexico, and Florida. Of respiratory samples that tested positive at public health laboratories during the reporting week, about 77% were influenza A, and of subtyped samples, about 90% were the 2009 H1N1 strain. Hospitalization surveillance shows a slight rise compared to the week before, with levels highest in seniors, followed by children younger than 4. So far, one pediatric flu death has been reported in the current flu season. Antibiotic use, hand contamination linked to spread of resistant bacteria in nursing homes News brief Chris Dall, MA Topics Antimicrobial Stewardship Exposure to antibiotics, hand contamination, and physical independence were among the factors associated with environmental contamination with vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE) in nursing homes, researchers reported last week in The Lancet Health Longevity. vzmaze / iStock The study, conducted by researchers with the University of Michigan Medical School, aimed to identify characteristics associated with contamination of the environment by nursing home residents colonized with VRE. While most nursing homes try to disrupt the transmission of VRE and other resistant pathogens through environmental cleaning and promotion of hand hygiene among staff, the researchers wanted to see if they could disrupt the process of transmission earlier by identifying characteristics that might make patients more likely to shed and spread VRE. The researchers enrolled 245 participants from six US nursing homes, collecting patient data and analyzing surveillance cultures obtained from participants (hands, groin, perirectal region, and oropharynx) and their rooms (including surfaces such as doorknobs, wheelchairs, and toilet seats) over multiple visits. At baseline, VRE colonization was present in 49 participants, and environmental contamination was present for 36 of those participants. VRE prevalence across all hand samples was significantly higher when VRE was found on both participant and environmental sites (hands contaminated in 50 of 99 samples) than when VRE was only present on body sites (7 of 55 hand samples). Antibiotic stewardship, hand hygiene could cut spread Multivariable analysis identified antibiotic exposure (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.75; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.22 to 6.16) and male sex (aOR, 2.75; 95% CI, 1.24 to 6.08) as being associated with increased risk of environmental contamination by VRE-colonized patients and physical dependence as being associated with a reduced risk of environmental contamination (aOR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.83 to 0.99). "Our results support a model of VRE transmission in nursing homes whereby colonised residents with sufficient physical independence can contaminate their environment via their hands, which is likely to increase the chance of a resident with an antibiotic-disrupted microbiota acquiring VRE colonisation, either directly from the contaminated environment or via a health-care worker intermediate," the study authors wrote. They say the findings highlight antibiotic stewardship and hand hygiene as possible interventions for reducing VRE contamination and transmission. Poll shows a third of Americans believe they don't need flu, COVID vaccines News brief Stephanie Soucheray, MA Topics COVID-19 Influenza Vaccines Fort George G. Meade Public Affairs Office/Flickr cc A third of Americans surveyed in a new poll from researchers at Ohio State said they do not believe they need vaccines for the flu or COVID-19 this season because they do not consider themselves high risk for complications from the viruses. The survey was conducted from October 20 through the 23rd of this year among a sample of 1,007 respondents. The survey was conducted via web (977) and telephone (30). Eighty-seven percent of those surveyed said they are doing everything they can to avoid spreading respiratory illnesses to others, but the researchers say one third of those polled said their vaccine decisions do not affect others. Flu, COVID vaccines can be given at same time Vaccination against flu, COVID-19, and respiratory syncytial virus (for those over 60 or those 32 to 36 weeks pregnant from September to January) is recommended for almost all Americans by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Recent studies have shown the flu and COVID-19 shots can be given at the same time with no adverse side effects. Additionally, a pneumonia vaccination is recommended for adults age 65 or older, those age 5 to 64 who are at increased risk for pneumonia due to chronic heart or lung disease or weakened immune systems, and children younger than 5, the researchers said. Respiratory viruses can cause really severe and life-changing disease for some people, even among the young and very healthy. Vaccines reduce community spread of the virus and can lessen disease severity. "Respiratory viruses can cause really severe and life-changing disease for some people, even among the young and very healthy," said Megan Conroy, MD, a pulmonologist and critical care specialist at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, in a press release on the survey results. US COVID markers show declines or stable trends News brief Lisa Schnirring Topics COVID-19 The nation's COVID indicators—the main ones and the early markers— declined or held steady for the week ending November 4, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said today in its latest update. NIAID/Flickr cc In its severity indicators, hospitalizations declined 8% compared to the previous week, and of the very few counties reporting high levels, most were in the Midwest and Northwest. Deaths, which had been slightly rising over the past weeks, remained level, making up 2.5% of deaths, which appear to be higher in Kentucky than in other parts of the country. Of the early markers, emergency department (ED) visits declined 5.3%, and New Mexico is the only state at the moderate level. Test positivity remained level and is at 9% nationally but is a bit higher in the Midwest and West. In its variant proportion updates, the CDC said the HV.1 Omicron subvariant, which descends from EG.5.1, continues to rise, and 29% is the most common variant. Another that showed rises over the past 2 weeks was HK.3, another EG.5.1 descendant. The level of BA.2 viruses, which likely include the highly mutated BA.2.86, showed a very small rise, currently making up an estimated 1% of samples. Nebraska confirms TB case at daycare, investigates exposures News brief Lisa Schnirring Topics Tuberculosis In Nebraska, the Douglas County Health Department (DCHD) recently announced that tests have confirmed an active tuberculosis (TB) case at a drop-in daycare in Omaha and that it is investigating more than 500 possible exposures. Tonpor Kasa / iStock In a press release, the DCHD said the exposures occurred from late spring through late October. Officials are investigating the patient's activities while he or she was contagious, helping the patient isolate, and observing treatment completion until tests are negative. The DCHD is also notifying parents of children and anyone else who had close contact with the patient, which is focused on extended time spent in the same room with the patient. Children's Nebraska hosted a clinic over the weekend to test children ages 4 and younger who were exposed to the patient over the last 10 weeks. The DCHD also said it is holding clinics at the daycare facility, Westview YWCA, to test anyone exposed between late May until August 21. Officials said it regularly manages TB cases, having confirmed 15 cases in 2022 and 15 cases so far this year. The DCHD said the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have reported more than 8,000 cases this year. Symptoms can include a cough that lasts several weeks, chest pain, and coughing up blood or sputum, along with weight loss, decreased appetite, fever, and chills. Chronic wasting disease detected in new area of Idaho News brief Mary Van Beusekom, MS Topics Chronic Wasting Disease Larry Smith / Flickr cc Idaho Fish and Game has confirmed the first chronic wasting disease (CWD) case this hunting season in a new area of the state. The affected mule deer was found just south of New Meadows in Game Management Unit 32A. Before this case, CWD had been detected only in Unit 14, north of Riggins, in fall 2021. "This is an unfortunate situation, but it's why we test throughout the state for this disease," Fish and Game Director Jim Fredericks said in a news release. "If it's on the landscape, we want to know where, and we rely on hunters to provide samples so we can test for it and continue to manage to limit the spread of this disease." Migration patterns to determine management To determine the extent of CWD in Unit 32A, Fish and Game asks deer and elk hunters in Units 32A, 22, 23, 24, and 32 to have the heads or lymph nodes of their harvested animals tested for the disease. It also asks motorists to report any road-killed or sick-looking deer or elk in the Highway 95 corridor from Riggins to Weiser. The CWD detection in Unit 32A will likely be managed differently than the 2021 detection in Unit 14 because of migration patterns, the news release said. If it's on the landscape, we want to know where, and we rely on hunters to provide samples so we can test for it and continue to manage to limit the spread of this disease. "In the Slate Creek area north of Riggins, most animals remain nearby year-round, but migration patterns and winter ranges of deer where this particular animal was harvested are more complex," Fredericks said. "Most animals have already moved out of the northern part of unit 32A and will not return until spring." CWD is a fatal prion disease that causes neurodegeneration, similar to "mad cow disease," in cervids, or members of the deer family. The disease hasn't been shown to infect people, but health officials urge people to avoid eating infected animals and to use precautions, such as wearing rubber gloves and minimizing contact with brain and spinal tissues, when processing deer.

Interactions across the generations, for example, between school-age children with their grandparents, are ripe moments for the influenza virus to spread under one roof.“This is something influenza absolutely loves,” said Dr. Jonathan Temte, an associate dean at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health.Seasonal flu, a respiratory virus, thrives when people are indoors in the colder months, mostly from November through February, spreading through droplets in the air, when someone coughs or sneezes, or through germs that accumulate on surfaces.You can prepare for the holiday season by taking steps to avoid passing on germs to friends and family as flu cases begin to rise, along with other respiratory illnesses, such as COVID-19 and respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV.Updated guidance: There's a shortage of RSV shots for babies. See the CDC's new guidance on who can get themCases are up. So what?There has already been a slight uptick in cases, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s weekly flu tracker. Cases appear to be increasing in the southeastern, south central and West Coast regions of the U.S. Hospital admissions have also increased across the U.S. in recent weeks. The first child died of the flu this season, the CDC said in its latest report.While the impact is still marginal, it indicates that flu rates are increasing.“The bottom line is that the flu is not to be trifled,” Dr. Nirav Shah, principal deputy director for the CDC, told USA TODAY. “It is not just a cold. It is a serious disease that can land you in the hospital and sadly, unfortunately, kill people, too.”Older people, pregnant people and infants are at greater risk of hospitalization or death from the flu. In the 2021-22 season, the U.S. saw an estimated 5,000 deaths and 100,000 hospitalizations linked to influenza.‘Treating both ends of the leash:' How a new Pittsburgh clinic treats humans, petsWhat are flu symptoms, risks?Unlike a cold, which has milder respiratory symptoms and generally does not cause a fever, the flu can bring serious complications. Flu symptoms include fevers or chills, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, muscle or body aches, headaches and fatigue.Now is the best time to take preventative steps, people shouldn’t wait until hospitals become full or people start dying of the flu to get their shot, said Dr. Philip Huang, director of the Dallas County Department of Health and Human Services, in Texas. By late October, the CDC estimated less than 30% of the U.S. adults had gotten their flu vaccination. How does the vaccine work?The flu vaccine is an injection of an inactive form of the virus that helps a person develop antibodies to protect them if they're exposed to the illness. “The vaccines will provide a form of protection to keep you from getting the flu,” said Jodie Guest, vice-chair of epidemiology at the Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University, in Atlanta. “If you do get the flu, they lessen your symptoms and the duration of your symptoms.”Annual flu vaccines protect against four different viruses, based on the strains that are expected to be dominant this season. Some flu seasons are worse than others depending upon which viruses are circulating. The shot, of course, isn’t foolproof. Viruses change constantly, making it necessary for public health officials to update the vaccines. Annual vaccines don't catch all strains, but they can still be effective at reducing illness caused by other viruses that are circulating.Repeat: It’s not too lateExperts typically estimate that the vaccine is at full effectiveness after about two weeks, but some protection is better than none.The vaccine is typically free for people with health insurance. People without insurance can in many cases get the shot for free through their local health departments or clinics. While you're there, experts say, you can also update your COVID-19 and RSV vaccines.None of the vaccines are a cure-all, but they do protect people from the risk of serious illness.“The vaccines aren’t perfect, but what they’re really helping with is keeping people out of the hospital,” said Dr. Miranda Durham, the state chief medical officer for New Mexico. Her state has seen a slow start to the flu season, but she said there's an increase in COVID-19 cases.After getting a shot, some people feel achy or feverish for a few hours or up to one day. That’s the vaccine getting the body’s immune system ready for the live virus.What else can I do?There are additional steps to keeping friends and family safe, many of which people learned during the COVID-19 pandemic. If you sneeze or cough into your sleeve, you'll curb the impact. And handwashing is another easy way to reduce the spread of the virus, the CDC said. Officials also recommend cleaning surfaces that have routine contact. In crowded, enclosed areas, like on subways, buses, planes or airports, wearing a mask can help prevent the spread of the flu, COVID-19 and RSV. You can also reduce exposure by improving airflow, for example, by opening a window in your home or car.There's one more tip: If you feel sick, stay at home.Eduardo Cuevas covers health and breaking news for USA TODAY.

Back to Healio Influenza activity is increasing in most parts of the United States and is at or above baseline levels in three regions, the CDC reported Monday. During the week ending Nov. 4, 2.9% of outpatient visits nationally were for influenza-like illness (ILI) — an increase from 2.8% the previous week and equal to the national ILI baseline that the CDC set for the 2023-2024 season. Data derived from CDC. ILI activity increased in eight of 10 U.S. regions during the week, the CDC reported. The agency estimated that there have been at least 490,000 illnesses, 5,300 hospitalizations and 330 deaths from influenza so far this season. As cases track upward, we compiled a list of five recent Healio articles about influenza, including several updates on vaccine research. FDA will review self-administered flu vaccine for approval AstraZeneca announced in October that the FDA will review what could be the country’s first self-administered influenza vaccine: FluMist — the company’s nasal spray vaccine — which is already approved for use in the United States, but only as administered by a health care professional. Amesh A. Adalja, MD, and Healio | Infectious Disease News Editorial Board Member William Schaffner, MD, weighed in with their perspectives on what a self-administered influenza vaccine could do for uptake.

F.) Nees is a medicinal plant previously reported with broad-spectrum antivirals but the mode of inhibition remains elusive. The objective of this study was to identify the most active fraction from A. paniculata ethanol extract (APE, APE-2A, APE-2B and APE-2C) and dry powder extract (APSP) against influenza A (H3N2), representing RNA viruses, and herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1), representing DNA viruses. The results showed that the fractions APSP, APE, APE-2B, and APE-2C directly neutralized the HSV-1 and influenza A (H3N2) when incubated at room temperature for 60 min before infecting the cells. The results also showed that the additional APE-2A fraction also directly neutralized the influenza A (H3N2), but not the HSV-1. The APE, APE-2B and APE-2C inhibited the HSV-1 by more than 0.5 log when the fractions were introduced after infection. Similarly, the APSP and APE inhibited the influenza A (H3N2) more than 0.5 log after infection. Only 50 μg/mL APE-2C inhibited the viruses greater than 0.5 log. In addition, A. paniculata extracts were also evaluated for their interfering capacities against nitric oxide (NO) production in LPS-activated RAW 264.7 macrophages. As well, APE-2C potently inhibited NO production at the IC50 of 6.08 μg/mL. HPLC and LC–MS analysis indicated that the most actively antiviral fractions did not contain any andrographolide derivatives, whereas the andrographolide-rich fractions showed moderate activity.

F.) Nees, commonly known in Thailand as “Fah Thalai Jone” belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is found throughout tropical and subtropical Asia and Southeast Asia1. A. paniculata extracts exhibit a wide range of pharmacological activities such as immunostimulatory1,2, antiviral3,4, and antibacterial activities5. A. paniculata extracts contain several constituents with a high content of andrographolide. The extract has broad-spectrum antiviral properties including the possibility of in vitro and in vivo anti-HIV6, as well as in vitro anti-dengue virus and chikungunya virus activity7. A. paniculata extracts are effective against the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) that causes herpes8 as well as reduced the inflammation caused by influenza viruses9,10. In addition, these extracts have also been reported to inhibit the division of influenza viruses11, hepatitis C virus12, and anti-viral mutations that cause resistance to such antiretroviral drugs13. The anti-inflammatory14 and anti-allergic activities15 of A. paniculata have been attributed to andrographolide, which is the major active compound16,17.Because of the COVID-19 pandemic that first arose in December 2019, this virus poses a serious risk to patients. The key mechanism for the manifestation of this disease is the inflammation process, which was the focus of this research which investigated the antiviral efficacy and anti-inflammation of A. paniculata extract. As SARS-CoV2, a causative agent of COVID-19 is an enveloped RNA virus, influenza virus A (H3N2) was chosen as the representative. In addition, HSV-1 was also selected as an enveloped DNA virus as a surrogate for the COVID-19 virus. The anti-inflammatory activities were tested by a nitric oxide inhibitory assay using the Griess reaction.ResultsCytotoxicity assayTo evaluate the cytotoxicity of A. paniculata extract fractions, i.e., APSP, APE, APE-2A, APE-2B and APE-2C, various concentrations were tested against Vero cells and Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells using the colorimetric MTS assay. After 24 and 48 h of reaction, the living cells (% cell viability) were measured. The results indicated that the cytotoxicity of each extract was different depending on reaction time, cell type and concentration (Figs. 1 and 2). In both Vero and MDCK cells, APSP, and APE-2A had no toxicity in every concentration (Fig. 1). On the contrary, APE, APE-2B and APE-2C showed cytotoxicity at 24 h and increased at 48 h. Interestingly, APE-2B showed cytotoxicity only in Vero cells (Figs. 1 and 2). The 50% cell cytotoxicity were calculated and shown in Fig. 2. Vero cells seemed to be more sensitive to A. paniculata extracts (APE, APE-2C and especially APE-2B) than MDCK.Figure 1Cytotoxicity assay by MTS for 4 h of Vero and MDCK cells at 24 and 48 h reaction with various concentrations of A. paniculata extracts as follows: APSP, APE, APE-2A, APE-2B, and APE-2C.Full size imageFigure 2Cytotoxicity concentration (CC50) of A. paniculata extracts as follows; APSP, APE, APE-2A, APE-2B, and APE-2C in Vero cells and MDCK cells. Data represented Mean ± standard error of mean (SEM) of three independent experiments.Full size imageDirect effect of A. paniculata extracts on virus particles (pre-exposure experiment)To observe whether the A. paniculata extracts (APSP, APE, APE-2B and APE-2C) could directly inactivate the virus infectivity, pre-exposure experiment was performed. APSP, APE-2B and APE-2C were able to destroy the HSV-1 virus particles directly except for APE-2A, while they all were able to destroy the influenza A (H3N2), viral particles directly (Fig. 3). Viral inhibition concentration (IC50) was calculated comparing to the control viruses without the extracts (Table 1). Acyclovir treatment, a common anti-HSV-1 drug, was used as a positive control (Supplemental Fig. 1).Figure 3Pre-exposure experiment of A. paniculata extracts as follows; APSP, APE, APE-2A, APE-2B, and APE-2C against HSV-1 in Vero cell (A) and Influenza A (H3N2) in MDCK cell (B).

Viral inhibition concentration (IC50) was calculated comparing to the control viruses without the extracts (Table 2).Figure 4Post-exposure experiment of A. paniculata extracts as follows; APSP, APE, APE-2A, APE-2B, and APE-2C against HSV-1 in Vero cell (A) and Influenza A (H3N2) in MDCK cell (B).

The extracts were evaluated for their inhibiting NO production activity in LPS-activated RAW 264.7 macrophages. Dexamethasone was used as a positive control (IC50 = 1.00 μg/mL). The results indicated that APE-2C was the most potent activity fraction (IC50 = 6.08 μg/mL) and APE was a moderate activity fraction (IC50 = 31.14 μg/mL) as presented in Fig. 6A, Table 3. None of the extracts was toxic the cells, as measured by the MTT assay at the tested concentration, which confirms that the reduction in NO levels is not directly related to cell death (Fig. 6B).Figure 6Nitric oxide inhibitory activity (A) and cell viability (B) at the effective doses.Full size imageTable 3 NO inhibitory effects of A. paniculata extract and dexamethasone.Full size tableHPLC analysis of andrographolide and 14-deoxy-11,12-didehydroandrographolideThe calibration curves of andrographolide and 14-deoxy-11,12-didehydroandrographolide were performed at different concentrations (5, 10, 25, 50 and 100 μg/mL). The amount of each andrographolide and 14-deoxy-11,12-didehydroandrographolide was calculated based on a linear equation: Y = 57.008X + 133.85, R2 = 0.9999 and Y = 24.467X + 15.41, R2 = 0.9999, respectively. Each calibration point was conducted in triplicate. APE-2C showed the amounts of andrographolide and 14-deoxy-11,12-didehydroandrographolide at 51.68 ± 0.47%w/w and 48.22 ± 0.50%w/w, respectively while they were presented as lower than LOQ in APE-2B (Table 4).Table 4 Andrographolide and 14-deoxy-11,12-didehydroandrographolide content in extracts.Full size tableStructural characterization of chemical constituents in fraction APE-B and APE-CUntargeted identification of metabolites in this study aimed to putatively identify the metabolites in the active fraction APE-2B and APE-2C. The total ion chromatogram (TIC) (Fig. 8). showing that the metabolites were distributed with different fraction putatively identify 37 metabolites in both fractions. This putative identification was produced from MS2 fragmentation that had been confirmed and compared with the literature. Those compounds consisted of metabolites from the group of terpenoids, flavonoids, phenolic, fatty acid and other groups.TerpenoidsTerpenoid compounds were found in both fractions especially fraction APE-C. There were 6 compounds including andrographolide (5), parthenin (6), ginsenoside Rh5 (28), 16-hydroxy-8 (17),13-labdadien-15,16-olid-19-oic acid (35), neoandrographolide (36) and 14-deoxy-11,12-didehydroandrographolide (37).Flavonoids and phenolsFour flavonoid compounds were identified in fraction APE-B including 6-Hydroxy-4′,7-dimethoxyisoflavone (13), 4H-1-Benzopyran-4-one,2-[3,4-bis(phenylmethoxy)phenyl]-3-hexyl-5,7,8-trimethoxy (29), gaudichaudiic acid G (30) and dihydrogambogic acid (34). Three phenolic compounds were also identified in fraction APE-B including 3-hydroxy-3-phenylpropanoic acid (1), 4'-hydroxyacetophenone (2) and 4-(3-hydroxybutyl)-2-methoxyphenol (4).Fatty acidFatty acids were also identified in only fraction APE-B including 2,4-dimethylpimelic acid (3), methyl 2E,4E,6Z-decatrienoate (7), 9-hydroxy-2Z,5E,7Z,11Z,14Z-eicosapentaenoic acid (8), 8,11,14,18-eicosatetraynoic acid (11), 9-hydroxy-10-octadecen-12-ynoic acid (14), lactobionic acid (16), chloroxanthin (17), 18-hydroxylinoleic acid (18), 6Z,9Z,12Z-octadecatrienoic acid (19), 13-hydroxy-9Z,11E-octadecadienoic acid (20), 3E,9Z,12Z,15Z-octadecatetraenoic acid (21), 2-hydroxyoleic acid (24), 6Z,9Z,12Z-octadecatrienoic acid (25), hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (26), and linolenic acid (27).Other groupsIn addition, there were 5 compounds which contained nitrogen and sulfur in the structure including semilepidinoside A (12), 7-hydroxy-6-methyl-8-ribityl-lumazine (15), 2-oxo-4-methylthiobutanoic acid (22), 2-oxo-8-methylthiooctanoic acid (23) and caracurine V (33).DiscussionAndrographis paniculata extract has long been used in the Thai market as a dietary supplement in several formulations, which the general public can access and use to treat common colds and viral infections. In this study, we report the viral-replication inhibitory effect of the fractions obtained from A. paniculata ethanol extract (APE, APE-2A, APE-2B, APE-2C, and APSP) against H3N2 and HSV-1, representing enveloped RNA and DNA viruses, respectively. Moreover, the inhibitory effect of each fraction on the production of NO which is an important mediator in the regulation of inflammation was also presented.The cytotoxicity of A. paniculata extracts to Vero and MDCK cells were different depending on concentration, reaction time and cell type. MDCK cells were more resistant to the extracts than the Vero cells. According to the results of our pre-exposure and post-exposure experiments, several A. paniculata extracts can directly destroy and inhibit the production of HSV-1 and influenza A (H3N2) virus particles. The APSP showed weak activity to both HSV-1 and influenza A (H3N2) with IC50 = 99.86 μg/mL and 275.8 μg/mL, respectively for pre-exposure experiment while IC50 = 114.5 μg/mL, for post-exposure experiment of influenza A (H3N2) only. This result may possible that the extraction with a high temperature of boiling and spray drying processes cause the reduction of active compounds in the extract. The degradation of andrographolide, which is the reported major component of the extract, can be occurred in the high-temperature condition19. The activity of APE and APE-2C on HSV-1 and influenza A (H3N2) with the IC50 values in the range of 7.692 μg/mL to 47.52 μg/mL (Tables 1 and 2) may be attributed to the presence of andrographolide and 14-deoxy-11,12-didehydroandrographolide shown as dominant in the extracts. HPLC analysis showed the amount of andrographolide and 14-deoxy-11,12-didehydroandrographolide in both extracts were similar proportion (Table 4). It has been hypothesized that the benefits of A. paniculata extract depend largely on the major components, andrographolide and its derivative which showed the effective against influenza A as well as HSV-120,21. This study showed that both APE and its active component andrographolide-containing fraction (APE-2C) had a potent inhibitory effect on viral multiplication. Surprisingly, the strong activity against HSV-1 and influenza A (H3N2) with the IC50 = 2.43 μg/mL and 1.837 μg/mL, respectively for pre-exposure experiment and IC50 = 3.892 μg/mL and 7.327 μg/mL, respectively for post-exposure experiment displayed from fraction APE-2B (Tables 1 and 2). HPLC chromatogram of APE-2B (Fig. 7) did not show the signal of andrographolide and 14-deoxy-11,12-didehydroandrographolide but showed only less abundant in LC/MS analysis (Fig. 8). Fraction APE-2B has displayed several compounds with the most abundant is the fatty acid. Possible blocking mechanism of virus-entering cells; The compound blocks the cellular receptor, thus interfering with the virus-binding, or the compound blocks the virus-binding moiety (RBD of spike), thus interfering with the cellular receptor or the compound disrupts the lipid membrane of the virus, thus disintegrating the virus particle. However, this point was not conclusive yet on which compounds cause the activity in this fraction. Further studies need to be done to find the chemical markers.Figure 7HPLC-VWD chromatogram of APSP (A), APE (B), APE-2B (C) and APE-2C (D).Full size imageFigure 8Total ions chromatogram (TIC) of fraction APE-2B in positive mode (A), fraction APE-2B in negative mode (B), fraction APE-2C in positive mode (C) and fraction APE-2C in negative mode (D). Peak numbers of compounds correspond to those in Tables 5 and 6.Full size imageTable 5 MS data of (+/−) ESI- QTOF-MS/MS spectra and the identification of fraction APE-2B.Full size tableTable 6 MS data of (+/−) ESI- QTOF-MS/MS spectra and the identification of fraction APE-2C.Full size tableAndrographis paniculata extracts were also evaluated for their efficacy in inhibiting NO production in LPS-activated RAW 264.7 macrophages. The test results showed that APE-2C, a fraction containing andrographolide, suppresses NO production with an IC50 of 6.08 μg/mL, whereas the APE exhibits an IC50 of 31.14 μg/mL. The higher activity, more than 5 times, can be attributed to the higher percentage of andrographolide in APE-2C compared to APE resulting from the fractionation process. It is important to note that the results of the anti-inflammatory activity assessments for fractions APE-2B demonstrated an absence of NO inhibitory effect primarily due to the lack of andrographolide, as confirmed through high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis. This finding supports the anti-inflammatory activity of two A. paniculata fractions, which is considered beneficial against viral infections-induced inflammation.ConclusionsHere, we demonstrated the efficiency of A. paniculata extracts on their inhibition of viral multiplication using HSV-1 and influenza A (H3N2) virus, representing DNA and RNA viruses, respectively. The potent anti-viral activity together with the favorable inhibition NO production support further development of A. paniculata extract against virus infection. Surprisingly, the fraction with potent antiviral activity, APE-2B, lacked andrographolide and its major derivative (14-deoxy-11,12-didehydroandrographolide), indicating that other compounds in the extract may contribute to the antiviral activity. Based on our finding, it is conceivable that further exploration and development of A. paniculata extract may be warranted for its potential application in the development of antiviral and anti-inflammatory pulmonary products.MethodsChemicals and reagentsAcetonitrile and water (LC–MS reagent) were from JT Baker (Mallinckrodt Baker, Inc.

Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) and Fetal bovine serum (FBS) were supplied by Gibco Life Technologies (Grand Island, NY, USA).Plant materials, extraction, and isolationThe aerial part of A. paniculata belonging to the family Acanthaceae was collected from Phitsanulok Province, Thailand. The plant collection method and experimental use were in accordance with all the relevant guideline. The voucher specimen, collection-number 05831, was deposited at the PNU herbarium located at the Faculty of Sciences, Naresuan University. Air-dried aerial parts of A. paniculata (530.2 g) were extracted with 95% EtOH over a period of 3 days at room temperature and evaporated under reduced pressure to obtain a A. paniculata crude extract (APE, 43.08 g). The APE was further subjected to column chromatography over silica gel (SiliaFlash Irregular Silica Gel P60, 40–63 µm, 60 Å) using hexane as eluent and increasing the polarity with EtOAc (100% hexanes—100% EtOAc) to yield 3 fractions (APE-2A, APE-2B and APE-2C). The dry powder extract of A. paniculata (APSP) was prepared from air-dried plant sample (550.1 g) boiled with 5 L of distilled water for 30 min, then applied to mini-spray dryer (BUSHI Mini Spray Dryer B-290).Cell cultureVero (ATCC, CCL-81) cells, a continuous epithelial cell line isolated from African green monkey kidney cells (Cercopithecus aethiops) since 1967, was used to multiply HSV-1 while Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) (ATCC, CCL-34) cells, a continuous epithelial cell line derived from a kidney of an apparently normal adult female cocker spaniel dog (Canis familiaris) since 1958 by S.H. Madin and N.B. Darby, was used for influenza A (H3N2) multiplication. Vero cells were cultured in M199 growth medium [Medium 199 (Gibco, USA) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Gibco, USA), 100 units/mL of penicillin, 100 µg/mL of streptomycin, 10% sodium bicarbonate, and 1M HEPES whereas MDCK cells were cultured at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in MEM (Gibco, USA) growth medium. Both cells were sub-cultured every 2–3 days. When the cell monolayer was observed, the medium was discarded. Subsequently, the cell monolayer was washed with 1 × phosphate buffer saline (PBS), pH 7.4 twice. Next, pre-warmed trypsin–EDTA (0.1% for Vero cells and 0.25% for MDCK cells) was added and incubated at 37 °C for 2–3 min or until the round shape cell was observed. After that, trypsin was discarded, and the cell culture flask was gently knocked to detach the cells. The cells were then resuspended with the growth medium and sub-cultured at a split-ratio of 1:3 (Vero cells) and 1:5 (MDCK cells).Virus stock preparationStandard HSV-1 strain KOS and influenza A (H3N2) viruses were used throughout the study. HSV-1 (KOS) at multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 were infected in vero cells while INF A (H3N2) at MOI of 10 were infected in MDCK cells. After inoculation, the cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C (rocking every 15 min) and washed once with 1xPBS, pH 7.4. Next, the M 199 maintenance medium (Medium 199 supplemented with 2% FBS, 100 units/mL of penicillin, 100 µg/mL of streptomycin, 10% sodium bicarbonate, and 1M HEPES) was added in HSV-1 infected cells. For influenza A (H3N2) infected MDCK cells, MEM maintenance medium [serum-free MEM with 1 µg/mL l-tosylamido 2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich, Inc., St. Louis, MO, USA)] was added. The infected cells were incubated at 37 °C for 48–72 h or until cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed. The HSV-1 infected Vero cells were frozen at − 80 °C and thawed at 37 °C for 3 times and centrifuged at 350 × g, 4 °C for 5 min whereas the influenza A (H3N2) infected MDCK cells were subsequently centrifuged without freeze–thaw process. The viruses in supernatant were aliquoted and kept at − 80 °C until used. The viral titer was determined by plaque titration assay.Plaque titration assayHSV-1 titration: The stock seed HSV-1 was diluted (ten-fold serial dilutions) and 50 µL of the diluted HSV-1 were added to 96-well plate (Thermo Scientific, China) in quadruplicate. Next, 50 µL of Vero cells (3 × 104 cells/well) were added to each well. The plate was incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. After that, 100 µL of overlay medium with 0.8% gum tragacanth in M199 growth medium were added and incubated at 37 °C for 3–4 days. Then, the plaques were developed as follows. The overlayer was removed and replaced by 100 µL of 1% crystal violet in 10% formaldehyde solution. After 45 min later, the plate was washed with running tap-water and air-dried at room temperature. The number of plaques was counted. Finally, the viral titers were calculated (plaque forming units per milliliter; PFU/mL). Influenza A (H3N2) titration: MDCK cells were plated at a density of 1.3 × 105 cells/well in 24-well tissue culture plate (Nunc, Denmark) and incubated overnight. 100 µL of ten-fold serial dilution of influenza A viruses (H3N2) were added into each well in duplicates. The plate was incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 1 h (rocking gently every 15 min). After that, the viruses were removed and 0.5 mL of overlay medium (1% low melting agarose in serum-free MEM with 1 µg/mL TPCK-trypsin) were added and incubated at 37 °C for 2–3 days. Subsequently, the plaques were developed similar to previous described.Cytotoxicity assayCellTiter 96® AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (MTS) (Promega, USA), a cell metabolic assay was used. The principle is based on detection of the living cells. The living cells will use MTS tetrazolium compound to produce formazan substance. The formazan was detected by using NAD(P)H-dependent dehydrogenase enzymes. The Vero cells (3 × 104 cells/well) and MDCK cells (6 × 104 cells/well) were treated with various concentrations (as indicated) of herb solutions for 24 and 48 h at 37 °C. Ten microliters of MTS reagent were then added and further incubated for 4 h. Then, the mixture was measured the absorbance at 450 nm (nm) using a microplate reader (PerkinElmer, USA). The control was the untreated cells. Another control background was the medium and MTS reagent. Survival rate (%) was calculated according to instruction of the manufacturer. Three independent experiments with duplication were done.Plaque reduction assay (PRA)For pre-exposure, various concentrations (two-fold dilution) of the herb solution were mixed with fixed amount (1 × 105 PFU) of either HSV-1 or influenza A (H3N2) virus for 60 min at room temperature. After that, the viral titer was determined by plaque assay. For post-exposure, the virus (1 × 105 PFU) was first inoculated for 60 min onto overnight cell culture of 1 × 105 cells/well for Vero cells, 1.3 × 105 cells/well for MDCK cells grown in 24-well plate.After that, the cells were wash once with PBS, pH 7.4 and then various concentrations (two-fold dilution) of the herb solution was added onto the cells and incubated for 24 h. The viral production was quantitated by plaque assay. 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) was calculated compared to the untreated viruses. Three independent experiments with duplication were done.Nitric oxide (NO) inhibitory assayThe Griess reaction was used to determine the level of NO production in the medium as described in previous report22. Briefly, RAW 264.7 cells (1 × 105 cells/well) were seeded in 96-well plates in DMEM containing 10% FBS. After incubation for 24 h, the cells were pretreated with different concentrations of the extract or vehicle (DMSO) for 2 h and then stimulated with LPS (1 μg/mL) for 18 h. The culture supernatant was collected and mixed with Griess reagent. Dexamethasone was used as a positive control. All experiments were performed in triplicate. Cell viability was performed using MTT assay. Briefly, MTT solution (0.5 mg/mL DMEM) was added to each well and then incubated for 4 h in a humidified atmosphere. After the incubation period, the supernatant was removed and DMSO was added to dissolve formazan crystals. The absorbance was measured at 570 nm using microplate reader. The results were calculated and presented as the percentage of cells viability.Determination of andrographolide and 14-deoxy-11,12-didehydroandrographolide in active fraction by HPLCA stock solution containing of mixture standard compounds, andrographolide and 14-deoxy-11,12-didehydroandrographolide (1 mg/mL) in methanol, was prepared and diluted with methanol for creating a standard curve (ranging from 5.0 to 100 μg/mL). The active fraction APE-2B and APE-2C (5 mg each) were weighted and dissolved in 1 mL methanol to produce 5 mg/mL stock solutions. These stock solutions were then diluted with methanol to a concentration of 0.25 mg/mL for APE-2C and 1 mg/mL for APE-2B. The sample solutions were then filtered through a 0.45 μm nylon membrane syring filter and 20 μL of each was injected into a reverse phase Phenomenex C18 column (250 mm × 4.6 mm, 5 μm) using an Agilent 1260 infinity HPLC equipped with UV/VWD system (Singapore). The mobile phase was composed of water (A) and methanol (B) with the linear gradient program using a flow rate of 0.7 mL/min as follows: 0 to 15 min, 60–90% B; 15 to – 20 min, 90–100% B; 20 to – 25 min, 100% B and then held with 60% B for 5 min. The UV detector set at 230 nm with injection volume of 20 μL.Phytochemical screening by LC-ESI-QTOF-MS/MSThe LC-ESI-QTOF-MS/MS system consist of HPLC unit 1260 infinity Series (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany) coupled with a 6540 ultra-high-definition accurate mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies, Singapore). Chromatographic separation of the andrographolide extract (concentration 10 mg/mL) was carried out on a Luna C18 column (150 mm × 4.6 mm, 5 μm, Phenomenex, USA) at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min. The column temperature was kept at 35ºC. The mobile phase consisted of a combination of A (0.1% formic acid in type I water, v/v) and B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile, v/v). The elution gradient from 25 to 95% B in 15 min hold on for 10 min and post run for 5 min. The injection volume was 10 μL using auto sampler. The dual electrospray ionization (ESI) source was operated in both negative and positive mode. The ESI condition was as follows: drying gas (N2 gas) temperature: 350 °C, gas flow rate: 10 L/min, nebulizer pressure: 30 psig, mass range: 100–1000 m/z, scan rate 4 spectra/s, capillary voltage 3500 V, skimmer voltage 65 V, octapole RFV 750 V and fragment voltage 50 V respectively. The automatic fragmentation pattern was set with collision energy at 10, 20 and 40 V using UHP N2 gas. Accurate mass measurements (error < 5 ppm for analytes) were obtained by means of an automated calibrant delivery system on a daily using a dual-nebulizer ESI source (calibrant solution B, Agilent Technologies, USA). Two reference masses were constantly introduced during the acquisition and used for drift correction (calibrant solution A, Agilent Technologies, USA). All acquisition and analysis of the data used MassHunter Data Acquisition Software Version B.05.01 and MassHunter Qualitative Analysis Software B 06.0 (Agilent Technologies, USA). To identify the compounds, peak retention time, mass data, and their fragmented ions were compared to those of registered compounds on public databases: Human Metabolome Database (HMBD), lipid maps, METLIN Metabolomics Database and Library (Agilent technology). The mass error was calculated when comparing a theoretical m/z and an experimentally observed m/z of an assignment.

The illness, which infects poultry and waterfowl, has seen a resurgence throughout the United States in the past year and a half. According to the latest data by the U.S Department of Agriculture, between March, 2022 and November 13, 2023, 61.60 million birds were infected with avian influenza nationwide.The first case in Missouri was confirmed on March 3, 2022. According to the Missouri Department of Agriculture, the latest cases were detected in two commercial flocks – one in Benton County on November 6 and one in Jasper County on November 14.Symptoms include decreased drinking and eating, a drop in egg production, a quieter flock and a sudden increase in bird deaths.Prevention measures for keeping your flock safe include limiting contact with wild birds such as wild waterfowl; restricting visitor access to your flock; and cleaning and disinfecting all equipment, including cages and coops borrowed from another producer, all wheels on vehicles and wagons and trailers that visited an area or farm that has poultry.

(AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill, File) By MIKE STOBBE Share Share Copy Link copied Email Facebook X Reddit LinkedIn Pinterest Flipboard Print NEW YORK (AP) — The U.S. flu season is underway, with at least seven states reporting high levels of illnesses and cases rising in other parts of the country, health officials say.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention posted new flu data on Friday, showing very high activity last week in Louisiana, and high activity in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, New Mexico and South Carolina. It was also high in the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, the U.S. territory where health officials declared an influenza epidemic earlier this month.“We’re off to the races,” said Dr. William Schaffner, a Vanderbilt University infectious diseases expertTraditionally, the winter flu season ramps up in December or January. But it took off in October last year, and is making a November entrance this year. Flu activity was moderate but rising in New York City, Arkansas, California, Maryland, New Jersey, North Carolina, Tennessee and Texas. And while flu activity has been high in Alaska for weeks, the state did not report data last week, so it wasn’t part of the latest count. Tracking during flu season relies in part on reports of people with flu-like symptoms who go to doctor’s offices or hospitals; many people with the flu are not tested, so their infections aren’t lab-confirmed. COVID-19 and other respiratory viruses can sometimes muddy the picture. RELATED COVERAGE Don’t wait for a holiday surge. Now is a good time to get your flu and COVID-19 vaccines It’s time to roll up sleeves for new COVID, flu shots Alicia Budd, who leads the CDC’s flu surveillance team, said several indicators are showing “continued increases” in flu. There are different kinds of flu viruses, and the version that’s been spreading the most so far this year usually leads to a lesser amount of hospitalizations and deaths in the elderly — the group on whom flu tends to take the largest toll.So far this fall, the CDC estimates at least 780,000 flu illnesses, at least 8,000 hospitalizations and at least 490 flu-related deaths — including at least one child. Budd said that it’s not yet clear exactly how effective the current flu vaccines are, but the shots are well-matched to the flu strains that are showing up. In the U.S., about 35% of U.S. adults and 33% of children have been vaccinated against flu, current CDC data indicates. That’s down compared to last year in both categories. Flu vaccination rates are better than rates for the other two main respiratory viruses — COVID-19 and RSV. About 14% of adults and 5% of children have gotten the currently recommended COVID-19 shot, and about 13.5% of adults 60 and older have gotten one of the RSV shots that became available earlier this year.___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

Print Los Angeles County has confirmed its first flu death of the season, and with the bulk of the season still ahead, health officials are reminding residents to get vaccinated.The person who died was elderly and had multiple underlying health conditions, according to the county Department of Public Health. There was no record of the person being vaccinated for flu this season, officials added.“Although most people recover from influenza without complications, this death is a reminder that influenza can be a serious illness. … Annually, thousands of people nationwide are hospitalized or die from influenza-associated illness,” health officials said in a statement. Advertisement California When is the best time to get a flu shot? And what kind should I get? Here’s what you need to know about flu shots and when to get them, based on the latest information from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Sept. 7, 2023 Statewide, nine people have died from flu since Oct. 1, according to the latest data from the California Department of Public Health.Flu season usually runs from October through May and peaks around February, but every season is different. An estimated 670 Californians died from flu during the 2022-23 season, public health figures show.Federal health officials have long recommended most everyone get an annual flu shot. But that call has taken on increased urgency in recent years, given the additional threat posed by COVID-19 and respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV. Advertisement Health officials are preparing for the possibility of a renewed “tripledemic” this winter, with all three viruses circulating widely at the same time. Last year, Southern California was hit hard by an early onslaught of RSV, a historically strong start to the flu season and a COVID-19 spike — straining a healthcare system already stretched thin and sending patients to the emergency room in droves.“Current indicators of influenza activity in Los Angeles County are in line with past seasons and have been rising in recent weeks,” officials said. California Bay Area reinstates COVID mask orders in healthcare settings. Will L.A. follow? Some San Francisco Bay Area counties are reinstituting mask requirements in healthcare settings to coincide with arrival of the annual respiratory illness season.Nov. 8, 2023 As of the week that ended Nov. 4, the most recent period for which data are available, flu activity was still considered low statewide, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Advertisement But flu activity is increasing as the holiday season approaches, and officials largely recommend everyone age 6 months and older, especially older adults and those with weakened immune systems, get vaccinated.Although some healthy people may be unfazed by flu season, officials say they should still get the shot so they don’t spread the illness to someone who might not recover as quickly.

The US is normalizing the cruelest mass killing method to stop it.We failed to prepare, and now animals are paying the price.by Marina BolotnikovaUpdated Dec 13, 2023, 4:37 PM UTCFacebookLinkTwo hens who survived ventilation shutdown plus, a method that’s been used to kill millions of poultry birds via heatstroke during the current bird flu outbreak, huddle together in a small battery cage at a factory farm in Iowa in 2022. Direct Action EverywhereMarina Bolotnikova is a deputy editor for Vox’s Future Perfect section. Before joining Vox, she reported on factory farming for national outlets including the Guardian, the Intercept, and elsewhere.The 2022-2023 spread of bird flu has been the most catastrophic on record in the US. In less than two years, it’s hit hundreds of poultry factory farms across nearly every state in the country, costing the federal government $757 million and counting to manage, and the poultry industry more than $1 billion in lost revenue and other costs (experts also fear that the disease could spark an outbreak in humans). To help stamp out the disease’s spread, all of the more than 72 million chickens, turkeys, and other birds raised for meat and eggs on affected farms have been killed and disposed of, whether or not they actually had the virus, which can spread rapidly and has a very high mortality rate for poultry birds.This fall, bird flu is surging again. Since October, it has infected dozens of factory farms largely in the Midwest, resulting in the extermination of more than 13.7 million chickens and turkeys in less than two and a half months.I use the word “extermination” deliberately. Although many outlets have written that the birds on farms hit with bird flu are being “euthanized,” the reality of these mass killings is far from the painless end implied by that term. Last year, I wrote a great deal about the rise of “ventilation shutdown plus” (VSD+), a method being used to mass kill poultry birds on factory farms by sealing off the airflow inside barns and pumping in extreme heat using industrial-scale heaters, so that the animals die of heatstroke over the course of hours. It is one of the worst forms of cruelty being inflicted on animals in the US food system — the equivalent of roasting animals to death — and it’s been used to kill tens of millions of poultry birds during the current avian flu outbreak. As of this summer, the most recent period for which data is available, more than 49 million birds, or over 80 percent of the depopulated total, were killed in culls that used VSD+ either alone or in combination with other methods, according to an analysis of USDA data by Gwendolen Reyes-Illg, a veterinary adviser to the Animal Welfare Institute (AWI), an animal advocacy nonprofit. These mass killings, or “depopulations,” in the industry’s jargon, are paid for with public dollars through a USDA program that compensates livestock farmers for their losses.In America’s peer countries, ventilation shutdown has been effectively banned because it’s so inhumane; last year, Danish bioethicist Peter Sandøe told me he was “shocked” by the method’s prevalence in the US and that in the European Union, relying on it would be illegal. Thousands of US veterinarians, animal welfare experts, and animal advocates have protested the use of ventilation shutdown. But a growing body of evidence obtained through public records requests shows that the poultry industry, in partnership with agricultural and veterinary authorities, is quietly normalizing ventilation shutdown and planning its further use — even though the USDA’s own policy says it can only be used as a last resort.Ventilation shutdown has become a go-to for the poultry industryUSDA regulations specify that VSD+ is meant to serve as a stopgap when one of two other depopulation methods aren’t available in time for producers to rapidly cull their farms: firefighting foam, which is sprayed over the birds to suffocate them, or carbon dioxide poisoning (neither of these is painless, especially the former, but both are widely considered less cruel than ventilation shutdown). A baby turkey is engulfed with firefighting foam during a cull at a farm in Israel during the previous bird flu outbreak in 2016. This method is also used in the United States and is a preferred alternative to ventilation shutdown, but is considered inhumane in the European Union. Glass Walls / We Animals MediaTwo baby turkeys are still alive after their flockmates were culled with firefighting foam in Israel in 2016. Glass Walls / We Animals MediaBut getting access to these methods on short notice requires advance planning — having standing contracts with companies that can supply CO2 gas, for example — that neither the meat industry nor its regulators appear interested in ensuring is in place. VSD+, on the other hand, can more easily be arranged in a pinch because heaters can be rented off-the-shelf from equipment companies. When disaster strikes, livestock producers that failed to prepare can simply say they had no choice but to kill their animals with heatstroke.“Failure to prepare is not a justification for using a less humane method,” a source who has worked in the livestock industry for decades and spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the professional repercussions of criticizing industry practices told me. Peer countries like Canada and those in the EU, the source pointed out, are doing fine in their bird flu response without resorting to mass ventilation shutdown (which isn’t to say that mass killings of animals by other means are humane because, among other reasons, they very often leave suffering survivors). In some European countries, nitrogen-filled foam, a newer, much less distressing technology that quickly renders birds unconscious and kills them through oxygen deprivation, has been used. In the US, there have also been reports that livestock producers, especially massive factory farms that house hundreds of thousands or millions of birds on one site, prefer to use VSD+ because it’s logistically easier to deploy than other methods, requiring less staff and less cleanup. Hens culled using ventilation shutdown plus are moved down a conveyor belt into a truck, after which they’ll be disposed of. This took place on an egg factory farm of more than 5 million hens in Iowa in 2022. Direct Action EverywhereIn February, Pennsylvania’s Department of Agriculture spent $119,000 to buy 14 heaters and related supplies to carry out ventilation shutdown plus during bird flu outbreaks, according to documents obtained in a public records request by AWI and shared exclusively with Vox. Producers seeking to kill their flocks with ventilation shutdown have generally tended to rent heaters on a one-off basis, but Pennsyalvania’s decision to buy a set of heaters suggests an intention to continue using the method. (The state is the country’s fourth-largest producer of eggs and eighth-largest producer of turkey.)“We know VSD+ heat played a critical [role] in Pennsylvania in 2022 … We are entering a time of heightened risk, and with high [egg farm] density in Lancaster County, PA, need to know such resources are readily available for the region,” Pennsylvania’s former state veterinarian, Kevin Brightbill, wrote in an email to colleagues last December, discussing the need to procure heaters for ventilation shutdown. (This correspondence was also obtained by AWI.) In February, once the state ag department had made the decision to buy the heaters, Brightbill wrote in an email that they needed to come up with a “non-VSD based justification for purchase of this equipment.” That last point is key — ventilation shutdown was never meant to be a default method, so emergency responders aren’t supposed to plan to use it routinely. The USDA’s rules are based on the American Veterinary Medical Association’s (AVMA) guidelines for depopulating animals, which classify ventilation shutdown plus as “permitted in constrained circumstances,” meaning it should only be used if less inhumane methods aren’t available. Preferred methods should be used for emergency response planning, the guidelines state, and “less preferred methods should not become synonymous with standard practice.” But that’s exactly what’s happened in the US poultry industry.Screenshot from Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture correspondence on the purchase of heaters for ventilation shutdown plus, obtained by the Animal Welfare Institute.Now, with heaters in its emergency response arsenal, the marginal cost to Pennsylvania of using ventilation shutdown will be even lower. “This just reinforces our impression that VSD is the ‘go to’ depopulation method and little serious attempt is being made by states to conduct the preparation needed to use preferred methods of killing,” Dena Jones, director of AWI’s farm animal welfare program, told me in an email. “Without continuing pressure from animal advocates, it’s likely that even more birds would be killed with this barbaric method.”Bird flu “is still a very present threat to Pennsylvania’s $7.1 billion poultry industry,” Shannon Powers, press secretary for Pennsylvania’s Department of Agriculture, told Vox in an email responding to a request for comment on the heater purchase. “Each situation that involves making a decision to euthanize animals is evaluated individually to ensure American Veterinary Medical Association approved methods are chosen … Having equipment readily available in the event of an emergency can reduce response time, eliminating prolonged suffering by animals infected with a highly contagious, generally fatal disease, and preventing further spread of the disease.” (It’s worth noting here that, especially on large factory farms where animals are distributed among several large sheds, many of the birds killed for disease control purposes haven’t been infected with bird flu.)Why some veterinarians are blaming their own professionMany critics of ventilation shutdown have blamed the AVMA for enabling the practice. By classifying the method as “permitted in constrained circumstances” (a designation that then became federal policy) rather than recommending against it, they argue, the AVMA has made it possible for factory farms to kill vast numbers of animals with heatstroke and claim they’re doing it with veterinary approval. The AVMA’s guidelines have helped create a situation in which “the poultry and egg industries lack any incentive to stop creating the precise ‘constrained circumstances’ in which the AVMA condones the inhumane method of VSD+Heat,” Reyes-Illg, the Animal Welfare Institute veterinary adviser, wrote in a letter to the AVMA in May 2022. “With the ‘easy’ method of VSD+Heat available to them, mega-CAFOs [or extra-large factory farms] are taking no measures whatsoever to enable the use of more humane methods.”Despite these criticisms, the AVMA hasn’t changed its position on ventilation shutdown, and critics say the organization has prevented open discussion about the problems with the method. Last year, Cia Johnson, the head of the AVMA’s animal welfare division, told an audience of veterinarians and livestock producers, “Some of these methods are at risk of leaving the guidelines. I think you probably have an idea of what those methods might be. We need data to support them staying in the document.” In January, I covered the growing movement of veterinarians who are challenging what they see as their profession’s alliance with the factory farm industry. Not long after, the AVMA denied admission to some veterinarians who are critical of VSD+ to its Humane Endings Symposium, a conference on animal kill methods. “I’ve been an AVMA member for 11 years. It is my responsibility as a veterinarian to question our profession’s role in allowing public funding of heatstroke-based mass killing of millions of animals, a method that should be considered criminal animal cruelty,” Crystal Heath, one of the vets who were barred from the symposium, told me. “It is disturbing that such discussions are forbidden.”The AVMA is now at work on the next edition of its depopulation guidelines. It’s unclear whether the classification of VSD+ will change, and the AVMA didn’t respond to a request for comment for this story. But it’s clear that the current situation is untenably cruel — and that it just isn’t necessary. What we lack is not the technology, but the will and moral leadership in institutions like the USDA, the AVMA, and animal agriculture itself to change the norms in an industry that’s grown accustomed to unaccountable cruelty.

Medscape Medical NewsBusiness of MedicineShould Physicians Go to Work When Sick?Amanda Loudin November 13, 2023 00Hospitals around the country struggled with the overlapping illness seasons of COVID-19, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and influenza last year making up a "tripledemic." Physicians and patients alike suffered under the strain of resource and personnel shortages. As a result, many clinicians weighed up the wisdom and consequences of going into work even when they were ill.This year as well, the threat of a tripledemic looms and many clinics, hospitals, and medical offices remain short-staffed, leaving doctors to struggle with their approach to working while sick. Some have a personal philosophy of staying home while ill to prevent any potential spread, whereas others feel the need to show up under most circumstances. The decisions often relate to where you work or in which department."As a former emergency medicine physician, it didn't matter if I was actively vomiting with the flu, I had to go to work," said Danielle Kelvas, MD, CEO and founder of DKMD Consulting, based in Chattanooga, Tennessee. "Rarely is there someone available to replace you, depending on how large your group or practice is."Benjamin Jack, MD, is an emergency physician and founder/CEO of Duration Health, in New York. He, too, reports to work through illness if he is physically able. "As an ER doctor, I tend to wait out minor illnesses because I can usually tell if an issue is serious," he said. "Most minor conditions improve without intervention. When necessary, I'll use my medical knowledge to self-treat or consult a colleague if it's something outside my area. For anything more complex, I seek another doctor's care."In contrast, Robert Miller, MD, doctor of internal medicine with Vista Staffing, makes staying home while ill a priority. "Taking care of the public starts with taking care of myself," he said. "I keep that in mind all the time. This extends to my fellow staff members, too, because their health matters as well.It's a dilemma that all physicians face at one time or another, and figuring out your approach will depend on employer guidelines, personal philosophies, and — in today's healthcare landscape — whether or not your facility is fully staffed, too.Feeling the PressureWithout question, the COVID-19 pandemic put pressures on doctors like never before. With overflowing hospitals and fellow staff members absent from work owing to illness, many physicians felt they had no choice but to show up for work if they were physically able. Prior to that, however, doctors still got sick with other illnesses and had to decide when to come in or whether to sit it out.A 2015 JAMA report, "Reasons Why Physicians and Advanced Practice Clinicians Work While Sick," explored why doctors still showed up when ill. The researchers performed a mixed-methods analysis of a cross-sectional, anonymous survey at a large children's hospital in Philadelphia. Nearly 460 attending physicians and other healthcare workers responded to the questions presented.Of those surveyed, 95% believed that working while sick put patients at risk. Despite this belief, 83% of the respondents reported working sick at least one time over the prior year, and 9% reported working while sick at least five times in that same period.This practice can indeed put patients' health at risk, according to the survey, which linked numerous reports of outbreaks that could possibly be traced to symptomatic healthcare workers. Some cases of flu, staph infections, norovirus, and pertussis were documented outbreaks originating from a sick healthcare worker. These associations have led to increased morbidity and mortality, as well as excess costs. This is especially true in cases where healthcare workers have exposed immunocompromised patients to a pathogen.Although all physicians understand the risks of working while sick, many feel boxed in by their institutions or departments. According to the JAMA report, "The decision to work sick is shaped by systems-level and sociocultural factors. Multimodal interventions are needed to reduce the frequency of this behavior." The lack of full staffing as a factor holds true in Jack's case. "If I'm not too sick to function, I'll go into work," he said. "My job requires a high level of commitment, and there's often no backup if I'm out."Kelvas said that since the pandemic, the "sick work" culture has improved as a whole, but it still doesn't allow healthcare workers to stay home. "During the pandemic I switched to primary outpatient care, and I naturally contracted COVID," she said. "Although sick as a dog, I was still seeing patients via Zoom between naps and coughing fits."While working remotely clears up the issue of potential transmission to patients and coworkers, it doesn't allow doctors the rest they need to return to the workplace at 100%. "Do I agree with this culture?" asked Kelvas. "Absolutely not. It's barbaric, and it's why I no longer work in direct patient care."Sit It Out, If PossibleAlthough doctors have always been aware of infectious disease prevention measures, the pandemic again drove home the need for those steps. Miller is especially conscious of the actions he can take to remain healthy. "I stay up to date with all my vaccines and any individual health screenings for my age group," he said. "I stay lean and fit; eat well; stay hydrated; and do all the simple things like wearing gloves, washing hands, and masking up."When Miller does feel ill, he takes immediate action. "If I feel a headache coming on or if I'm feeling a little off, I'll reach out to employee health to see if there are tests we can do," he said. "Many hospitals now have early testing so that you can stay on top of infection. I also keep a diary of symptoms, and if it seems like more than a common cold, I will self-isolate."Should a virus test turn positive, Miller will take the steps necessary to treat it, whether with medication for influenza or 5 days at home for COVID. Because Miller travels to various institutions, he's developed this universal approach to his own healthcare. But, he added, "Many of these inpatient settings have similar guidelines, while outpatient settings may be different."It's an unfortunate reality that sometimes, healthcare workers are the last to seek healthcare," Miller continued. "It's easy to be blind to the risks because we see them every day and probably don't appreciate them as we should."And even when physicians are fully aware the risks, sometimes their hands are tied. "Hospital sick leave policies generally assume there are additional personnel to fill in, an assumption that doesn't hold in many emergency departments," said Jack. "Given the staffing model in ERs, there's often no substitute physician on standby. Therefore, a policy on paper may not translate into practice when backups are nonexistent."What the CDC SaysSince the COVID-19 pandemic began almost 4 years ago, the advice and guidelines issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has evolved greatly. The most recent advice from the CDC on whether and how long you should isolate after SARS-CoV-2 infection reads like this:Isolation can be discontinued at least 5 days after symptom onset (day 0 is the day symptoms appeared, and day 1 is the next full day thereafter) if fever has resolved for at least 24 hours (without taking fever-reducing medications) and other symptoms are improving.A high-quality mask should be worn around others at home and in public through day 10. A test-based strategy may be used to remove a mask sooner.The CDC has also established guidelines surrounding the flu, specific to going to a workplace:All employees should stay home if they are sick until at least 24 hours after their fever (temperature of 100 degrees Fahrenheit or 37.8 degrees Celsius or higher) is gone. Temperature should be measured without the use of fever-reducing medicines (medicines that contains ibuprofen or acetaminophen). Note: Not everyone with flu will have a fever. Individuals with suspected or confirmed flu, who do not have a fever, should stay home from work at least 4-5 days after the onset of symptoms. Persons with the flu are most contagious during the first 3 days of their illness.RSV guidelines regarding isolation and/or the workplace don't exist on the CDC's site, but because RSV spreads easily through the air as well as through touch, staying home once you're aware of symptoms and for the next 8 days is generally a good idea. 0Credits:Lead image: E+/Getty ImagesImage 1: E+ / Getty ImagesMedscape Medical News © 2023 WebMD, LLCSend comments and news tips to news@medscape.net.

The second group of 30 healthcare workers received the Covid booster and flu shot on different days within the same month.The antibodies of both groups were then measured. The research concluded that the group that had their shots administered together had higher levels of immunoglobulin G1, or IgG1 – the antibodies that counter Covid-19 and that strain of influenza.Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told the Guardian that it was an interesting finding.“[It’s] possibly due to enhanced stimulation of the immune system by both vaccines being present at the same time,” Adalja said. “The key thing is to see if this has any kind of meaningful clinical benefit – do the higher levels of antibody translate into more protection against infection or disease?”The study has not been peer-reviewed yet, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention still recommends “getting a flu vaccine and Covid-19 vaccine at the same visit”.The CDC does not give a reason for getting both together but assures it is safe.The CDC cited one of its own studies on the side-effects that follow getting both shots at the same time. According to the CDC’s findings, although there are more side-effects associated with getting the Covid-19 booster and flu shot together, the side-effects are not as bad as only getting the Covid-19 booster.The CDC says: “People who got a flu vaccine and Covid-19 monovalent vaccine at the same time were slightly more likely to have reactions including fatigue, headache, and muscle ache than people who only got a Covid-19 monovalent vaccine, but those reactions were mostly mild and went away quickly.”Adalja said there also existed some data pointing to a possible small increased risk of strokes and mini-strokes in the elderly who get high doses of these vaccines, but said he did not believe it was a very meaningful increase in risk.Ultimately, whether for ease or the benefit of health, getting both the Covid and flu vaccines together seems to yield positive results.Adalja said: “Taking both vaccines at the same time is something that has always been more convenient for patients but now may also have an added immunologic benefit and should be generally recommended for those eligible for both vaccines.”Explore more on these topicsCoronavirusInfectious diseasesFluVaccines and immunisationnewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveTax strategyFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInXNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Study: Estimated Effectiveness of Coadministration of the BNT162b2 BA.4/5 COVID-19 Vaccine With Influenza Vaccine. Image Credit: New Africa / Shutterstock.com Background Due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) seasonal surge and declining effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines over time against new variants, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently approved an Omicron-specific booster for the 2023-2024 winter season. Initially, the CDC recommended a 14-day gap between COVID-19 and flu vaccination; however, updated guidelines support simultaneous administration following safety and efficacy studies. Nevertheless, further research is needed to evaluate the combined effectiveness of coadministered COVID-19 and flu vaccines at the community level. About the study The current study utilized the Optum deidentified Clinformatics Data Mart Database, which comprises a diverse population from U.S. commercial and Medicare Advantage health plans, to assess the effectiveness of coadministering BNT162b2-biv and SIVs. The study included adults over the age of 18 who were enrolled in insurance plans by August 2022 and received either of the vaccines or both between August 2022 and January 2023. Exclusions applied to individuals with prior COVID-19 or influenza diagnosis, those who received a different COVID-19 vaccine, or those who received a second vaccine dose too soon after the first. The researchers compared the same-day coadministration of BNT162b2-biv and SIV with their separate administration, specifically considering only enhanced SIVs for participants over 65 years of age. Vaccination statuses were identified through diverse coding systems across various healthcare settings. Key outcomes of the study included hospitalizations, emergency department visits, and outpatient appointments, in which specific International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) diagnosis codes were used. The study evaluated relative risks for COVID-19 and influenza outcomes by comparing groups who were coadministered vaccines with those who received these vaccines individually. Negative control outcomes included urinary tract infections and unintentional injuries to detect biases. The researchers thoroughly examined variables, including demographics, clinical profiles, vaccination records, and health-seeking behaviors. Using logistic regression models, propensity scores and stabilized inverse probability of treatment weights (IPTWs) were generated to balance baseline characteristics. Hazard ratios for different outcomes were determined through Cox proportional hazards regression models.

The research, categorized by age groups, refrained from formal statistical significance testing, relying instead on SAS and R for data analysis. The follow-up phase of the study began 15 days after vaccination and continued until predefined endpoints were reached. Study results In a study using the Optum deidentified Clinformatics Data Mart Database, 3,442,996 individuals met the criteria for analysis, with a mean age of 65 years. Among those aged 65 and older, 17.3% received both vaccines, with a higher percentage of women and many having a Charlson Comorbidity Index score of two or higher. The BNT162b2-biv vaccine was predominantly administered in retail pharmacies, whereas SIV administration was more evenly divided between offices and pharmacies. In those between 18 and 64 years of age, the prevalent SIVs were egg- and cell-based standard-dose types. The application of IPTWs achieved a balance in covariates, although discrepancies remained in the geographic region and the month of the index date. The median follow-up duration varied among the groups, with the longest being 109 days for older participants receiving coadministered vaccines. Upon examining COVID-19-related outcomes, all groups exhibited generally low incidence rates. Notably, those in the coadministration group experienced similar or marginally increased rates of COVID-19 outcomes as compared to those receiving only a single vaccine at once. The assessment of negative control outcomes revealed minimal bias. By calibrating the results with these outcomes, the risk estimates were adjusted closer to neutral, thus enhancing the reliability of the findings. Regarding influenza-related outcomes, the coadministration group, particularly those 65 years of age and older, was associated with a lower incidence of all influenza-related outcomes as compared to the SIV-only group. This pattern was consistent in the younger age group, with most confidence intervals crossing 1.00 after calibration with negative control outcomes. Sensitivity analyses, which included censoring for COVID-19 or influenza treatment and requiring a primary position diagnosis code for hospitalization, showed similar results across all outcomes and age groups.

They said she had a fever, low energy, and wasn't eating or drinking much.The following Thursday, a pediatrician tested her for the flu and found that she was positive. The parents said no other tests were run, including checking her oxygen level or chest X-rays. The doctor prescribed Tamiflu and advised them to watch her lips. If they turn blue, they must take her to the emergency room, they were told.The couple said Kennedy's grandmother, who took her to the doctor, pushed back."'She's never been this sick. It seems really serious, and he was like, 'That's just how the flu is,'" Megan said of her conversation with the pediatrician.The couple said they fully expected the doctor to send them to the hospital after that appointment but felt encouraged about their daughter's condition when they didn't have to go."Doctors are typically pretty good about telling you, 'Hey, you can die from this,'" Megan said. "We just didn't get that message, and if we would have, we would have taken her straight to the hospital."The following Saturday, the couple said Kennedy started to seem better. She was eating and drinking more.Kennedy spent that night in bed with Megan and Jesse, and when they woke up the following morning, they noticed her lips had a blue tint and decided to take her to the hospital immediately.On the way, Megan said Kennedy stopped responding to her in conversation, and she pulled over and found the child wasn't breathing. She called 911 and started performing CPR. A man passing by also stopped to help.Paramedics worked on Kennedy, and she was transferred to the Texas Medical Center but ended up passing away."I knew she wasn't OK, and I didn't think she was going to make it," Megan said. "I didn't understand how. Like, it didn't make sense how we got to this point."Ultimately, Kennedy was determined to have died from pneumonia caused by the flu.The CDC reported that in the 2022-2023 flu season, at least 154 children died from the illness. Half had no prior medical conditions, but most weren't fully vaccinated for the flu.Since then, Megan said she realized Kennedy was unvaccinated for the flu. She said she took her for her check-up with her pediatrician in July, which did not align with flu season. The couple said it slipped their minds to take her for the vaccine at the start of the flu season because they did not realize how serious the illness could be."With all the other stuff you have to worry about taking care of this little angel, this thing was not something on our radar that we had to worry about - this life or death, black or white," Jesse said.Megan said she questions if the vaccine would have changed Kennedy's outcome but said it is hard to run through the "what ifs."The parents now hope to use their story to encourage parents to be advocates for their children."We should have listened to our own instincts," Jesse said. "You know your kid and how they behave and what's normal for them. If it truly is abnormal, and even if the doctor says something, you're free to get another second opinion. I think it's worth it, because you don't want to have thought that and didn't do anything about it."Dr. Victoria Regan, a pediatrician at Children's Memorial Hermann Pediatrics, who is not associated with Kennedy's case, said if a child has a fever of 101 degrees that will not go down with medicine, has low energy, is not eating or drinking well, or is having difficulty breathing, it is time to take them to the emergency room."Anywhere from 5,000 to 25,000 kids per year end up having to be admitted to the hospital because of the flu, so it's not that uncommon," Regan said.She added pneumonia is a progression of the flu and generally develops in 48 to 72 hours but can take as long as five days. She said parents should call the children's doctors if the child is not improving in three to four days.Regan said the flu vaccine is typically 40 to 50 percent effective at preventing the flu. Still, those who have it usually do not have to go to the emergency room, become hospitalized, or die.Megan is scheduled to have the couple's son on Wednesday. They said they would advocate on his behalf and get second opinions when needed."Staying on top of it, asking the questions or follow-ups," Jesse explained. "It's easy to get complacent, especially if you know it's the 10th time she's gotten the cold. You start to feel like it's not that big of a deal, and we can get through this like we did everything else."Now, the couple wears bands on their arms that say "Kennedy Parks" to remind them of the girl they considered the center of their universe."These were her name bands around her water cups to go to school for her lunch every day," Jesse said. "It's something that was a silly thing, but she touched it every day."For more on this story, follow Mycah Hatfield on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KTRK-TV.

The study was published yesterday in Clinical Infectious Diseases. The 2022-23 flu season saw the highest influenza-associated pediatric hospitalization rate in the United States since 2010-11. Most of the illness was caused by the H3N2 strain. Outcomes were based on pediatric patients seen at 55 hospitals and 107 emergency department (ED) or urgent care (UC) sites through Kaiser Permanente Northern California, Intermountain Healthcare in Utah, and HealthPartners in Minnesota and Wisconsin. 40% protection against hospital cases The VE for vaccinated children against emergency department and urgent care (ED/UC) visits was 48% (95% confidence interval [CI], 44% to 52%). The study showed that 15.2% of vaccinated kids and 27.1% unvaccinated children made up ED/UC flu patients. The VE against hospital admission for the flu was 40%. Among kids hospitalized for the flu, 17.5% were vaccinated and 33.4% were unvaccinated. The authors of the study said lower VE may be due to lower vaccine coverage. The atypically early start of the 2022–2023 influenza season may have resulted in lower observed vaccine coverage. "The atypically early start of the 2022–2023 influenza season may have resulted in lower observed vaccine coverage, as activity started and peaked before many children and adolescents may have had an opportunity to get vaccinated," they wrote. US flu activity continues to rise steadily News brief Lisa Schnirring Topics Influenza, General Positive tests, hospitalizations, and outpatient visits for flu rose again last week, with levels highest in the south central, south, and western regions, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said today in its latest update. Fort George G. Meade Public Affairs Office/ Flickr cc The percentage of outpatient visits for flulike illness, at 3.5%, is above the national baseline for the second week in a row and is at or above baselines in 5 of 10 US regions. The percentage of respiratory specimens that were positive for flu rose to 4%, up from 3% the week before. Among positive samples at public health labs, 75.8% were influenza A, and, of subtyped specimens, 87.2% were the 2009 H1N1 strain. Estimated 8,000 hospitalizations, 490 deaths The CDC estimated that there have been at least 780,000 flu infections, 8,000 hospitalizations, and 490 deaths from flu so far this season. Hospitalizations rates are highest in seniors and in children ages 4 and younger, the two age-groups that also have the highest levels of outpatient visits. One state—Louisiana—reported very high flu activity, a marker that tracks clinic visits for flu. Eight jurisdictions reported high activity: Alabama, the District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, New Mexico, Puerto Rico, and South Carolina. The CDC didn't report any new pediatric flu deaths, which remain at one for the season. Earlier this week, however, Mississippi reported its first flu death of the season. Regarding flu vaccine uptake, the CDC estimates that more than half (57.6%) of seniors have been immunized, followed by nearly 35% of adults in other age-groups and 32.6% of children. The CDC recommends that all people ages 6 months and older be vaccinated against flu. High-dose fluvoxamine did not shorten COVID recovery times News brief Stephanie Soucheray, MA Topics COVID-19 Wikimedia Commons / Editor182 Results from a randomized clinical trial today of 1,208 participants show that high-dose (100-milligram [mg]) fluvoxamine did not improve time to sustained recovery in people with mild to moderate COVID-19 infections. Fluvoxamine, known as Luvox, is a selective-serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Its potential use for COVID-19 was considered as part of the Accelerating Coronavirus Disease 2019 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines (ACTIV-6) platform, which aims to investigate repurposed medications in the outpatient setting for mild to moderate COVID-19. The study is published in JAMA. Participants were enrolled from August 25, 2022, to January 20, 2023, and were 30 years or older with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and at least two acute COVID-19 symptoms for 7 days or less. The participants were randomized to receive fluvoxamine 50 mg twice daily on day 1 followed by 100 mg twice daily for 12 additional days (601 patients), or a placebo (607). The primary outcome was time to 3 consecutive days without symptoms. All patients recovered in 10 to 11 days The participants' average age was 50 years old, 65.8% were women, 45.5% identified as Hispanic/Latino, and 76.8% reported receiving at least two doses of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. The authors found no differences among the study participants in time to recovery (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.99; 95% credible interval, 0.89 to 1.09), with both groups achieving sustained recovery by days 10 or 11. No participants died during the study, and fluvoxamine was not associated with any adverse events. In an editorial on the study, two JAMA deputy editors wrote that the ACTIV trial is a success story of the pandemic. They note that shortly after the pandemic began, "the ACTIV platform also quickly began generating key insights for outpatient management of COVID-19 infection, such as the ineffectiveness of ivermectin." They suggest the model should be used to investigate treatments to several outpatient diseases in addition to COVID. MSF details mpox outbreak in DR Congo News brief Mary Van Beusekom, MS Topics Mpox CDC / Brian W. J. Mahy Medecins Sans Fronteires (MSF, or Doctors Without Borders) said yesterday that it battled an mpox outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)'s Equateur province from August to mid-October. An emergency team was in the Bolomba health zone in the western DRC to help health officials treat 890 mpox patients, provide education, contain spread of the virus, support 11 remote health centers, and conduct surveillance. Seventy-two patients (8.1%) were hospitalized. Mpox, which is characterized by skin lesions, can be accompanied by fever, sore throat, muscle aches, or lymph-node pain. "If the disease is not treated in time, it can lead to complications and death in those affected, especially if their immune system is compromised by other diseases," Raphael Kibwantiaka, head of MSF's emergency response in Bolomba, said in a news release. "As Bolomba was already grappling with a measles epidemic, we intervened against both diseases." Measles, malnutrition, malaria The workers followed up with more than 800 mpox patients at home and organized awareness-raising activities in healthcare facilities and the community to prevent disease transmission and combat stigma, "as the disease has highly visible signs on the body, sometimes leading to the rejection of patients by the community," Kibwantiaka said. The emergency team vaccinated 110,723 children against measles and treated 3,355 others. They also treated 827 malnourished children and 2,583 with malaria. The disease has highly visible signs on the body, sometimes leading to the rejection of patients by the community. Staff sometimes had to travel by canoe or motorcycle, often in the rain. Kibwantiaka said Bolomba's remote, densely wooded environment is rich in wildlife, which makes it conducive for the development of diseases with animal origins, such as mpox. "Eating bushmeat, handling dead animals, and animal bites or scratches encourage the transmission of the virus from animals to humans," he said. "Infected individuals then become highly contagious and need to isolate themselves quickly to prevent widespread transmission." Quick takes: RSV climbs in US, H5N1 avian flu variant, polio in 6 nations News brief Lisa Schnirring Topics Avian Influenza (Bird Flu) Polio Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) emergency department visits and hospitalizations continue to rise across the United States, and hospitalization rates for the virus are now increasing in seniors, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said earlier this week in a respiratory virus snapshot. RSV test positivity is rising steadily but is still below the peak for 2022. The CDC recommends the RSV vaccine for people ages 60 and up, based on shared decision making with health providers, and the CDC estimates that 14.3% of people in that age-group have been immunized. Researchers at the Netherlands' Wageningen University have reported that the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian flu virus connected to a recent layer farm outbreak involves a new variant that contains the PB1 gene segment from a low-pathogenic virus, according to a statement translated and posted by Avian Flu Diary, an infectious disease news blog. So far, it's not clear how pathogenic or contagious the variant is in poultry. In other avian flu developments, the US Department of Agriculture reported two more outbreaks in poultry at commercial farms, one at a broiler facility in Oregon and the other on a turkey farm in Minnesota. And animal health officials in Greenland have reported the first appearance of highly pathogenic H5N5 in wild birds, according to a notification from the World Organization for Animal Health. The detections were in a northern fulmar and a gull found dead in Disko Bay in western Greenland. Six countries reported more polio cases this week, including Pakistan, which reported its fifth wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case of the year, according to the latest weekly update from the Global Polio Eradication Initiative. The Pakistani patient is from Sindh province. The five other countries, all in Africa, reported more vaccine-derived cases. Chad, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Guinea, Nigeria, and Somalia reported more circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) cases. The DRC also reported four more cases involving circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1).

New research suggests yesA small study indicated that getting Covid and flu shots together could produce a stronger antibody response against the coronavirus than receiving them separately.Nurse Allissa Sanchez gives her patient a vaccine shot at a flu and Covid-19 vaccination clinic in Pasadena, Calif., on Oct. 12.Francine Orr / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images fileNov. 14, 2023, 8:01 PM UTCBy Aria BendixCovid and flu shots can be safely given at the same time, and according to a small new study, doing so may even confer benefits.Findings presented Monday at the Vaccines Summit Boston, an annual scientific conference, suggest that giving Covid and flu shots together could produce a stronger antibody response against the coronavirus than administering the vaccines separately.The study measured the antibody levels of 42 health care workers in Massachusetts who were vaccinated last fall. Twelve of the participants received a bivalent Covid booster and seasonal influenza shot on the same day. Another 30 received the shots on different days within the span of a month. Three to four weeks after people got their Covid boosters, those who had received the flu shot at the same time had higher levels of IgG1, an antibody involved in the body's front-line defense against Covid. The results held true six months later, suggesting that co-administering the vaccines could improve long-term protection.“We showed that the Covid antibody responses were higher and more durable if the Covid and flu vaccines were given on the same day,” said Susanna Barouch, the study’s lead author and an intern at the Ragon Institute's Systems Serology Lab in Cambridge, Massachusetts.The research is undergoing peer review and has not been published in a scientific journal. Ryan McNamara, the lab's director and senior author on the study, said the findings still need to be replicated in a larger group of volunteers, but he felt it was useful to share the results right away. In September, the findings were posted to the preprint server BioRxiv."We thought that these findings were very important for immediate public health decision making," McNamara said.He expects the results to apply to this year’s updated Covid vaccines, he added, though his team plans to explore that further. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends getting Covid and flu vaccines at the same appointment if people are eligible for both shots at once. But that recommendation is based on convenience rather than efficacy, said Dr. Judith O’Donnell, chief of infectious diseases at Penn Presbyterian Medical Center in Philadelphia, who wasn’t part of the study.“We probably would want to see this kind of data replicated using the current 2023 vaccines to really know with 100% certainty how giving those together might enhance immunity or not,” she said.How much of an immune response is too much?McNamara said it's still unclear why getting Covid and flu shots together might result in stronger, more lasting protection. One theory, he said, is that most people's bodies are already primed to produce Covid antibodies because they've been vaccinated or exposed to the virus before. Giving two vaccines at once could awaken this immune response to a greater extent than one shot alone, which may lead to more a robust antibody response, he said."Your immune system is a highly tuned army and it’s basically calling all the special forces at the same time," said Dr. Michelle Barron, senior medical director of infection prevention and control at UCHealth in Colorado, who was not involved in the research.But that strong immune response could also induce greater side effects, she added. In a 2022 study, getting a Covid booster and flu shot together was associated with an 8% to 11% higher rate of self-reported side effects like fatigue, headache and muscle pain in the week after vaccination compared to getting a Covid booster alone.An October analysis from the Food and Drug Administration, which has not been peer-reviewed, also identified a slightly elevated risk of stroke among people ages 85 and up who had received a high-dose flu shot at the same time as a bivalent Covid vaccine.Dr. Scott Roberts, an infectious disease specialist at Yale Medicine, said it's possible that "we're starting to see the immune system revved up so much that we're seeing these inflammatory conditions like stroke in this select age group."But Barron noted that many older people have underlying health conditions that independently increase their risk of stroke, and several other studies have not identified the same safety concern with co-administering Covid and flu shots."The benefit of getting the shots and knowing that you have that protection will outweigh any of these potential risks," she said.Experts say to get vaccinated now The CDC recommends getting a flu shot by the end of October. As of Monday, however, less than 33% of children and less than 35% of adults in the U.S. had gotten their flu shots, according to CDC data.Uptake of Covid shots is even lower this year: 5% of children and 14% of adults have received the updated Covid vaccine.O’Donnell said it’s reasonable for people to want to space out their shots to lower the risk of side effects. While the CDC does not recommend a certain waiting period between vaccines, O’Donnell suggested for people who prefer to space them out, separating the shots by a couple weeks.But infectious disease experts widely agreed that co-administration may be the best option at this point, since the vaccines take two weeks to be fully effective and both Covid and flu are spreading in the U.S. Covid hospital admissions fell 8% nationally the week ending Nov. 4, but they’re rising in many individual counties. Flu-related hospital admissions also rose 20% in that time, while the number of positive flu tests rose 50%."We've been seeing increases in Covid and now we're seeing increases in flu," Barron said. "There’s really no value in saying, ‘Oh, I’ll wait another week,’ because that’s another week where, whichever vaccine you didn’t get, you’re now potentially vulnerable."Aria BendixAria Bendix is the breaking health reporter for NBC News Digital.AboutContactHelpCareersAd ChoicesPrivacy PolicyYour Privacy ChoicesCA NoticeTerms of Service (Updated JULY 7, 2023)NBC News SitemapClosed CaptioningAdvertiseSelect ShoppingSelect Personal Finance© 2024 NBCUniversal Media, LLCNBC News LogoMSNBC LogoToday LogoHow can you protect yourself from flu? | PortalCLÍNIC jump to the main content jump to the bottom of the page News Podcasts Activities Location and contact Español Contenido en español Català Contingut en català English Current language Spanish COLLABORATE El Meu Clínic .

Clínic Barcelona Clínic Barcelona Health Topics November 16 2023 2023-11-28 How can you protect yourself from flu? There are a series of preventive measures that can both stop you catching flu and infecting others with this seasonal illness. The most effective preventive measure is an annual vaccination. When you have the flu, you can have a headache, fatigue, a blocked nose, a sore throat, a cough and even fever. These symptoms are caused by influenza viruses, which, in turn, cause the contagious respiratory infectious disease known as the flu. Most people recover from the flu on their own. However, the disease can last longer and be more serious in risk groups, such as children, pregnant women, the elderly or people with chronic diseases, such as diabetes or asthma or those who are immunocompromised. Therefore, it is important to take into account certain prevention measures, to help avoid the flu or reduce its symptoms. Staying home if you are sick or avoiding close contact with people who are sick are a couple of these measures. You should also cover your mouth and nose with a single-use tissue when coughing or sneezing, and throw used tissues in the bin. Washing your hands frequently to protect yourself from germs; avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth with dirty hands; and wearing a mask during healthcare visits are other healthy habits recommended to protect yourself and others from the flu. However, the most effective preventive measure is an annual vaccination. An annual vaccine is recommended for certain people from 6 months of age onwards, as it reduces the risk of contracting the infection in the general population by 40% - 60%. And, if a vaccinated person gets sick, the symptoms will be milder. This annual vaccine is primarily recommended for people who are at a higher risk of developing complications if infected with the influenza virus and those who are in contact with high-risk people. These are: People of 60 years old or older. Children over 6 to 59 months of age. People who have risk conditions (chronic diseases, immunosuppression, cancer, etc.). Pregnant women, in any trimester of pregnancy. Children and adolescents from 5 to 18 years of age under prolonged treatment with acetylsalicylic acid. Staff from health and social health centers (both health and non-health personnel). Children between 6 months and 2 years who were born premature. People who can transmit the flu to those who are at high risk of complications, such as their cohabitants and people who provide home care. Essential personnel, such as workers in the state security forces, firefighters, civil protection, prison officials, etc. Related contents Fever Headache Flu Vaccine Keep reading about: Flu; Vaccines; Vacunas; ICMID; Preventive Medicine and Epidemiology Service Share Share on Share on Share on Share on Share on Share on Did you like this article? 4 Related news Clínic Barcelona Clínic Barcelona November 5 2024 2024-11-05 Advances in the treatment of eye infections from contact lenses Clínic Barcelona Clínic Barcelona October 28 2024 2024-10-28 Why are cases of fatty liver increasing?

Learn more about your options and use the NFU's decision making tool to find the best option for your farm business. Primary cleaning and disinfection, which occurs immediately after culling of birds on an infected premises, is the responsibility of the APHA. Secondary cleaning and disinfection is the responsibility of the farm owner, manager or keeper. This must be thorough enough to eliminate the virus and there must be proof that cleaning of all areas of the infected premises has been done to an adequate standard. A prepared plan can help your business to get back on its feet as quickly as possible if disease outbreak is to occur as it will reduce the amount of time it takes for you to get a plan fully approved and actioned. In order to get livestock, birds or animals back on farm after disease has been confirmed, your secondary C&D plan must be approved by APHA. Even if you do not have an active disease outbreak on farm, ensuring that your C&D plan is written and prepared can help to improve the biosecurity measures on your farm, minimise the risk of disease outbreak and increase your business resilience. Scroll down to: What if I have no disease outbreak on my farm? Find the best C&D option for your farm Not sure which option you should take? Use our secondary C&D decision tool to help you find the best option for your farm business or holding. Option 1 This can be the quickest option to return your business to operation, but it is the most labour and financially intensive option. When a plan is pre-prepared and resources are available on farm to complete C&D, this option could be achieved within three months. More on Option 1 Option 2 This option can take around five to six months to complete from start to finish, including time required for primary C&D and culling. This can be the most appropriate option for seasonal businesses to complete. More on Option 2 Option 3 This option is for poultry keepers who are unable to carry out secondary C&D on their premises. It involves leaving the site empty of birds for 12 months, during which time any contaminated buildings cannot be used for other livestock or storage. More on Option 3 Need-to-know issues There are number of key areas of consideration on farm that if not acknowledged, could majorly slow down or even block the process of getting a plan passed. We've put together a list of key considerations when filling out your plan. Check out: Key areas of consideration for C&D plans What if I have no disease outbreak on my farm? You can still build a C&D plan and have it checked by a avian specialist private veterinary surgeon for general suitability, even if you do not have a disease outbreak on farm. APHA are unable to offer a plan checking facility at this time. Nevertheless, drafting a plan is an invaluable way to prepare your farm and minimise the risk of AI. A C&D plan can be used to identify any biosecurity gaps on your farm – once these gaps are addressed, your farm will be better prepared to handle a potential outbreak.

As COVID-19 becomes an endemic disease, scientists are attempting to predict the timing of future surges in infections."Having some idea of when we'll have surges in the future is important for public health policy and decision-making," said Jeffrey Townsend, Professor of Biostatistics and Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, at Yale University in the US. "Late fall, winter, and early spring are the highest-risk times for surges of infection," he added. The research published in the journal mBio can aid clinics and hospitals in preparing for a large number of COVID-19 patients. This prior knowledge is particularly essential since other respiratory viruses, such as influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), may be active at the same time, adding to the burden on healthcare systems. AdvertisementTo determine future seasonality and when SARS-CoV-2 will be most active, the researchers analysed monthly infection data of common-cold coronaviruses that are often attributed to causing colds. The studies conducted in Europe, East Asia, and North America from 1985 to 2020 had amassed viral samples from thousands of people. Using statistical methods, the team predicted that SARS-CoV-2 would surge in colder months, at least in the temperate places of the Northern Hemisphere they studied.Nonetheless, the exact timing of the surges will differ by location. It is worth noting that these results apply only when COVID-19 becomes an endemic disease, which has yet to happen. However, most experts believe it is imminent.Endemicity refers to the virus being steady in the population. The immune systems of the population have been exposed to the virus multiple times, and it spreads the same way every year without interventions. It is unclear how many years it will take to reach that point, but we may be almost there, or it could be another ten years.**The above article has been published from a wire agency with minimal modifications to the headline and text.

They added that people can recover from most respiratory infections without special treatment, but the elderly, children aged 5 and under and immunocompromised groups should visit hospitals promptly and take therapies as guided. Mi Feng, spokesman of the National Health Commission, said during a news conference that as winter approaches, China has entered the peak season for respiratory illnesses, and different viruses or pathogens are circulating simultaneously. "Efforts should be made to monitor the spread of mycoplasma pneumonia, COVID-19, influenza flu, as well as dengue fever and norovirus infections, to step up surveillance and early warnings so as to understand the spread of these viruses and their mutations," he said. Mycoplasma pneumoniae — a pathogen that commonly causes sore throat, fatigue, fever and a lingering cough that can last for months in children aged 5 and above — has drawn heightened attention this winter as hospitals nationwide have seen young patients swarming there to seek treatment. Tong Zhaohui, vice-president of Beijing Chaoyang Hospital affiliated to Capital Medical University and head of the Beijing respiratory disease research institute, said that regional epidemics of mycoplasma pneumoniae infections emerge every three to seven years. The pathogen tends to spread quickly among kindergartens, schools and family members, he added. "This year, the disease also inflicts children aged under three, but their condition is not more severe compared to previous years," Tong said. At his hospital, Tong said, the positivity rate for the pathogen stands around 5.6 percent for adults and 40.3 percent among children. He added that the increasing activities of the pathogen and other viruses are not unexpected. "During the COVID-19 pandemic, the spread of acute respiratory diseases appeared to be mild due to strict personal protection measures," he said. "With the ease of virus containment measures, the circulation of these diseases has returned to pre-pandemic status, which is normal." Wang Dayan, director of the China National Influenza Center administered by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said that flu activities across the nation have been rising, with H3N2 the dominant strain. In past years, the flu season for winter and spring usually runs from about mid-October to early March and peaks in January, she said. Wang stressed that an effective way to prevent flu infections and reduce related serious cases and deaths is expanding vaccinations. Arrangements have been rolled out to facilitate flu immunization among medical workers, the elderly, people with chronic diseases, staff members at nursery and elderly care centers, schools, as well as children aged from six months to five and family members of infants. She added that flu vaccine supplies this year have risen compared with last year and are sufficient to meet demand. Regarding COVID-19, Wang said that the number of domestic cases has been on a downward trend since late August and the positivity rate of the disease at fever clinics and hospitals is declining consistently. China reported 209 severe COVID-19 cases and 24 related deaths in October, according to the China CDC. However, Zhong Nanshan, a prominent respiratory illness expert, said during a conference on Friday that modeling shows that small spikes of COVID-19 infections will likely appear this month through to January. Zhong suggested the public, especially vulnerable groups, obtain updated vaccines as soon as possible.

Ball · CBC News · Posted: Nov 17, 2023 10:54 PM EST | Last Updated: November 18, 2023Elizabeth Melnick, founder Elizabeth's Wildlife Center, says a growing number of birds have been infected with avian flu. (Jon Hernandez/CBC News)Social SharingAs bird flu devastates a growing number of poultry farms in B.C., wildlife experts are raising the alarm about the deadly virus' impact on wild animals and possible threat of it turning into another pandemic among humans.The virus, known as avian influenza or H5N1, has spread to some birds of prey in the province, as well as skunks, experts say.One Abbotsford, B.C., wildlife rescuer said her centre has been inundated by calls to help an overwhelming number of birds recently — with rigorous disinfecting measures significantly raising costs and workload."The symptoms are horrible for these guys, and there's so many dead and dying all over the place," Elizabeth Melnick, founder of Elizabeth's Wildlife Center, told CBC News inside her rescue clinic. "It is really bad."Though rare, avian flu can spread to humans, Dr. Bonnie Henry warns in vaccination pushSo far, she's only seen geese and ducks carrying the virus, but the B.C. Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC) says the current strain has been seen in skunks, foxes and marine animals.Little can be done to help birds brought into her care, Melnick noted, except euthanizing them."There's nothing you can do. There's not a treatment," Melnick said. "Just as you get everything all changed and thrown away and sanitized, the phone rings and you've got to start over again. "It just goes on and on."WATCH | Avian flu has struck millions of birds across Canada: 'Explosive' avian flu surge hits global bird populations2 years agoDuration 2:02Global bird populations are being ravaged by a deadly strain of avian flu, wiping out flocks of domestic poultry and killing wild birds. Some researchers warn the virus could eventually evolve to better infect humans and potentially start a future pandemic.Risk of human pandemicAccording to the BCCDC, North America's current avian influenza strain is a contagious viral infection that mainly impacts birds "but can infect humans and other mammals." The agency said it spreads through direct contact with infected animals or remains. But so far, it emphasized, H5N1 has not spread to any British Columbians."While avian influenza viruses usually do not infect humans and cannot spread easily from person-to-person, we are monitoring closely," the BCCDC said in a statement Friday.As the virus spreads more widely among birds and mammals, however, the agency said it is being vigilant about "the potential for human exposure," as well as "concerns that the virus could adapt to infect humans more easily."The rising number of cases is also alarming for researchers and government officials, who are collaborating and sharing information through the Canadian Wildlife Health Cooperative (CWHC) — a cross-Canada network of experts that also partners with the country's five veterinary colleges and the British Columbia Animal Health Centre.While millions of birds have had to be killed, humans have so far been "really lucky," CWHC CEO Damien Joly said in an interview from his home in Nanaimo, B.C."But every time there's a human that is exposed to this virus, we run another chance of the virus evolving and adapting to be able to spread in humans," the wildlife biologist said. "It has that potential."Avian influenza on the rise in B.C. with 16 outbreaks reported since OctoberIn addition to its obvious threat to millions of farm poultry and the risk of it mutating into a human pandemic, he said wildlife researchers are also deeply concerned about wild species at risk.Although there is no vaccine or cure for infected animals, an experimental immunization has been attempted on endangered California condors — one of the raptors so far known to be at risk of infection."It's an experiment, so we'll see how it goes," Joly said.But even if a vaccine is effective "it's just not something that we would be able to to implement on any kind of scale." Instead, the solution is stricter security measures to keep farm animals away from wildlife, he said.Farmers are concerned about the spread of avian flu. (David P. Ball/CBC)'Quite devastating'According to the B.C. Poultry Association, a non-profit which represents more than 500 chicken and turkey operations in the province, the virus is spreading quickly.In just the last month, 32 poultry farms have been hit by the virus — affecting chickens, ducks and turkeys. Most are in the Fraser Valley, where migrating waterfowl are often the source."We're in peak fall migration right now … so as they come through the Fraser Valley, they are spreading the virus," association spokesperson Amanda Brittain said in an interview Friday. "If avian influenza is found on a farm, it is quite devastating."She said the virus is fatal for all infected birds, and entire flocks must be culled to prevent its spread. Once an infection is reported, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency takes over. Not only does the farmer lose their entire flock, Brittain said, but all traces of the virus must be eliminated before any new birds can replace the culled ones.Skunks are dying of avian flu. What does that mean for you and your pets?"I can't even describe the devastation of losing all your flock," she said. "It is mentally very difficult and financially challenging."Farmers that have not been personally impacted by the virus, their anxiety and stress levels are through the roof as they're trying to keep the virus out of their barns."But Brittain said that, thanks to rigorous regulations, consumers need not fear catching the virus from poultry on the butcher or grocery shelves."I don't want to downplay it for the individual farmer — it is devastating — but for the average consumer they're not going to see much difference at the grocery store," she said.Solving the problem is a vexing one for both farmers and wildlife experts.For rescuers, like Melnick, it's a taxing and seemingly intractable problem."I don't know if anybody really knows what the solution is," she said. "Our resources are extremely limited."ABOUT THE AUTHORDavid P. BallJournalist David P. Ball is a multimedia journalist with CBC News in Vancouver.

A total of 36 influenza deaths have been reported this year out of which 28 deaths were amongst the H1N1 infected patients and eight amongst the H3N2 infected patients said the report. (REPRESENTATIVE PHOTO) The influenza A virus is currently circulating in the state and surpassed the H1N1 (Swine flu) another subtype of influenza A virus, according to health department officials. Maharashtra has recorded 3,206 influenza cases of which 2,031 of them have been classified as H3N2 and 1,175 as H1N1, according to the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme report of the state health department. Pune district has between January and November 16 reported the third highest —434 influenza cases in the state According to the data provided by the state health department, Mumbai during the same period has reported the highest 1,869 influenza A cases, followed by Thane (590). A total of 36 influenza deaths have been reported this year out of which 28 deaths were amongst the H1N1 infected patients and eight amongst the H3N2 infected patients said the report. According to Pratapsinh Sarnikar, joint director of health services, all district health officers, civil surgeons and medical health officers are instructed to conduct regular surveillance of Covid-19 and influenza cases. “Isolation wards have been established in all government hospitals and government medical colleges in the state. The state health department has instructed all districts to conduct a compulsory medical death audit of influenza deaths. The state has prepared and disseminated the IEC prototype for influenza,” he said. The symptoms of H3N2 include fever and cough but it can cause severe complications in vulnerable populations like the elderly and individuals with underlying health conditions. The H3N2 influenza A is very prominent in circulation and H1N1 is doing the rounds as well but fewer cases of incidence have been reported in the state. Dr Subhash Salunkhe, public health expert, said, the potential for a virus to cause a pandemic depends on many factors like its ability to spread, the severity of the illness and availability of treatments. “The H3N2 is becoming a dominant strain now in circulation but it’s seasonal. Earlier it was the H1N1 and later the Covid-19. The viruses keep on mutating to survive. There is a need to watch and study the severity, transmission and virulence of the H3N2 subtype,” said Dr Salunkhe.

I have extensive training in reviewing medical journals and evaluating the quality of evidence in those journals. I concur that this study aligns with the CDC that most individuals have no higher risk of stroke from getting their Covid-19 vaccine and their flu shot at the same time. Why Get Vaccinated? What Are the Common Symptoms of Vaccination? What Are Some Common Myths About Vaccines? What Are Possible Health Complications From Getting Flu and COVID-19 Vaccines Together? Vaccination Fast Facts Vaccines can be given at the same time (co-administration) [1]. It is safe to get a flu vaccine (flu shot) with other recommended vaccines at the same visit [1]. Multiple vaccines should be given at separate places on the body, at least 1 inch apart [1]. It is safe to get a flu shot and a Covid-19 shot at the same time [1]. You may experience slightly more side effects when getting both shots at the same time, including fatigue, headache, and muscle aches [1]. If you choose to wait between getting both shots, there is no recommended waiting time between vaccines, so when you get it is up to you [1]. Three flu shots recommended for people 65 and older are either a higher dose or adjuvanted. According to the CDC, “An adjuvant is an ingredient added to a vaccine that helps create a stronger immune response to vaccination” [8]. Why Get Vaccinated? Flu [7] The flu shot can keep you from getting sick with the flu. When the flu shot is a similar virus to what is circulating in the wild, you’re 40-60% less likely to have to go to the doctor with the flu. Over the last ten years, studies have found that flu shots reduced the risk of adults being admitted to the hospital or ICU anywhere from 40 to 82% For those who got the flu shot but got sick and hospitalized with the flu, vaccinated patients had a 26% lower risk of going to the ICU and a 31% lower risk of death than unvaccinated patients. Suppose you have chronic health conditions like heart disease, chronic lung disease, or diabetes. In that case, the flu shot can reduce your risks of heart attack or worsening of your chronic condition. Covid-19 [4] The Covid-19 shot can keep you from getting sick with Covid-19. Getting your Covid shot is a safer way to build immunity to the Covid-19 virus than getting sick with Covid-19, since the shot gives more reliable immunity than getting sick with different strains. The Covid-19 shots are effective at protecting from serious illness, hospitalization, and death from the Covid-19 virus, especially for those with chronic illness. What Are the Common Symptoms of Vaccination? Common symptoms of the Flu shot, and Covid-19 vaccine include [3,6]: Pain where you got the shot Tiredness/sleepiness Loss of appetite Low-grade fever Chills Headache Nausea What Are Some Common Myths About Vaccines? MYTH: The flu vaccine will give you the flu. Flu vaccines cannot cause the flu because they contain an inactivated (killed) virus, which means it cannot reproduce like the influenza virus [6]. MYTH: You can’t get the flu shot if you’re pregnant. The flu shot is safe in pregnancy and reduces the risk of respiratory infection by 50%. It also protects your baby for several months after birth when they are too young to get the shot themselves [6]. MYTH: Children can’t get the flu shot. Flu shots are recommended for everyone six months and older and are encouraged to get annual flu shots [6]. Studies from 2017-2022 have shown that the flu shot can significantly reduce a child’s risk of dying, has reduced flu-related hospitalization by 41% in a 2020 study, and has reduced the risk of severe life-threatening influenza by 75% in a 2022 study [6]. Even the nasal spray, which has a “live virus,” contains a weakened version that will not make you sick with influenza [6]. What Are Possible Health Complications From Getting Flu and COVID-19 Vaccines Together? The Study A recent study published in 2023 has been making headlines after it evaluated the risk of stroke following a Covid-19 shot with the flu shot. The study by Lu et al. (2023) reviewed early data collected by the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) that tracks rare and severe events following immunization. In January 2023, the CDC made a public communication that stated the VSD found a higher risk of ischemic stroke in people 65 or older within 21 days after they received the Pfizer-BioNTech Vaccine. The VSD noted a higher risk of stroke when the person got both the high-dose or adjuvanted flu shot at the same time as the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine. This study only included Medicare beneficiaries ≥ 65 years old who received a Covid-19 bivalent shot or a high-dose/adjuvanted flu shot and had a stroke during follow-up [9]. The study had over five million patients in their primary review. After that, they performed a secondary subgroup analysis, which included over six million eligible Medicare beneficiaries ≥ 65 years old [9]. What the Study Found Outcomes of the primary study found no clear [statistically significant] increased risk of stroke following Covid-19 bivalent vaccination from either Pfizer or Moderna [9]. In their subgroup analysis, there was a higher risk of ischemic stroke following the Pfizer Covid-19 shot within 21 days following the shot , but only for those 85 and older [9]. The findings in this study are similar to what the VSD found in January 2023. The results of this study found that receiving the bivalent Covid-19 shot alone did not increase the risk of stroke in those 65 to 84 [9]. The study did find a small increased risk of stroke when receiving the high dose/adjuvanted flu shot alone. This study did not compare those who got the flu shot with those who got the flu virus. You have a higher risk of stroke from getting the influenza virus than getting the flu shot [9]. To quote the study, “More studies are needed to better understand the association between influenza vaccination and [risk of] stroke” [9]. What Should I Do with This Information? The study concludes that with the known benefits of the Covid-19 and flu vaccines, the benefits of getting vaccinated outweigh the risks of getting sick with either Covid-19 or influenza for persons 65 and older [9].

Having a cough lasting for more than a week or two? Fever, cold, and cough may be common this season, but doctors across the city are seeing many patients with complaints of prolonged cough, lasting anywhere between one and four weeks. Doctors, both in the government and private sectors, have been treating patients with coughs running a longer course. P. Paranthaman, professor and head, Department of Medicine, Government Kilpauk Medical College Hospital, explained that influenza virus affects the respiratory tract, causing symptoms such as fever, cold, throat pain, and cough, and may precipitate wheezing and breathlessness in those who have allergic tendencies like asthma. “The cough tends to be prolonged and severe and may persist for two to three weeks or more in such patients. But these symptoms may last for only a few days in a healthy non-allergic individual. We are seeing such cases of prolonged cough during this season,” he said. Suresh Kumar, consultant, Infectious Diseases, Apollo Hospitals, noted that cases of influenza continue to be seen in the city. “We are seeing patients diagnosed with influenza with prolonged coughs for two to three weeks, while in a few, it seems to last for two to three months too. Though flu cases are commonly seen during this time of the year, the cough seems to have a longer course. We do not know the exact reason. When we test patients, the common strains found are H1N1 and H3N2. This is a common experience for a number of infectious disease consultants,” he said. S. Chandrasekar, professor and head, Department of Medicine, Government Stanley Medical College Hospital, said doctors were also seeing patients with coughs lasting for three weeks. “This is usually due to viral infections. Not every patient will have a prolonged cough as it also depends on the immunity level. About 15%-20% of the patients may have prolonged coughs. The cough is aggravated when they speak or when there is a variation in external temperature,” he said. The viral pattern keeps changing, he said, adding: “However, as of now, we are seeing strains of H1N1 and H3N2 viruses.” While treatment is symptomatic, patients are advised voice rest. They should follow cough etiquette and wear masks as this could lead to family clusters of cases, he said. “This is usually self-limiting. But patients can keep monitoring their oxygen saturation level. If persons with co-morbid conditions have recurrence of fever, tiredness, headache or breathlessness and face difficulty in their day-to-day activities, they should consult a doctor and get evaluated,” Dr. Chandrasekar added. Another government physician said that if it proceeds into bronchitis, the cough would last for a month. Dr. Paranthaman said that if a person has a prolonged cough, he/she is advised to take adequate rest, good nutrition, warm water, adequate hydration as well as good sleep to improve immune response against the viral infection. Avoid exposure to cold air, going to the beach and dusty areas that will aggravate the problems. Get treated as per doctor’s advice and if the cough prolongs for more than two to three weeks, the person needs evaluation, he added.

For an added perspective on the figures and trends percentage, country sentinel sites reporting for WKs 43 & 44 are also shown. Please refer Seasonal Influenzafor Pacific Island Countries and Territories (PICTs) - ILI Surveillance Actual increase in the number of ILI cases has been seen in Kiribati, Wallis & Futuna, Tonga, New Caledonia and Fiji. The increased ILI cases seen in Samoa may be due to the increased number of sites reporting for the week. The reduction in the number of ILI cases has been seen in Palau, CNMI and RMI. The decreased ILI cases seen in Solomon Islands may be due to the decreased number of sites reporting for the week. No ILI cases have been reported from Pitcairn Islands. No reports were available from Guam, Vanuatu, Tokelau and Tuvalu for the week. American Samoa and Nauru have not participated in the surveillance. Surveillance figures are not intended to capture all country cases but to describe trends over time and are invaluable when trends rise beyond country baselines which should then trigger alerts and timely actions to characterize the actual nature and magnitude of the disease. Influenza updates from PICs: Fiji has reported 6 positive cases for Influenza A/H3 out of 52 samples in WK 44. For WK 44, French Polynesia has reported 3 new cases of influenza A out of 57 tests, 2 of these cases required hospitalization. Overall flu activity remains low. The seasonal vaccination campaign has been ongoing since October 23, 2023. Additionally, During week 44, 11 new confirmed COVID-19 cases from 79 test results, marking an increase compared to recent weeks, with a positivity rate of 15%. The EG.5.1 (ERIS) subvariant, initially reported in WK 42, was re-identified as WK44, while the XBB.1.5 subvariant continues to circulate. For risk groups, especially individuals over 60, a single dose of the new Comirnaty vaccine Omicron® XBB.1.5 is recommended. Source: Bulletin de surveillance sanitaire Polynésie française N°42 - 2023 -WK44/2023. CMNI reported 11 positive influenza cases out of 183 tests, indicating a 6.01% positivity rate. Among these, 11 were influenza A, 6 were influenza B, and 5 cases showed positive results for both influenza A and B. Co-infection with two different influenza strains in one patient is unusual. The CHCC laboratory plans to analyse subsequent samples testing positive for both Flu A and B using the GeneXpert machine, and they will also send these samples to GPHL for further subtype and lineage testing. This approach aims not only to confirm co-infection but also to track the continued circulation of these strains despite a decline in ILI and Influenza cases. In addition, 4 positive cases of SARS-Cov-2 for week 44 (Situation report WK 44 ends 04/11/2023). Tonga reported 11 positive cases of respiratory viruses out of 12 samples. Among these, (7) Human Rhino/Enterovirus, (2) influenza A/H12009, influenza AH3, and RSV, (1) Influenza A and (1) Parainfluenza virus 2 were detected for WK44. (Situation report WK 44: 2023). For WK 43, FMS has reported three out of four ILI cases were tested positive for H1N1 (FSM surveillance Situation report WK 43 ends 28/10/2023).

Gastroenteritis For WK44, the sentinel surveillance in French Polynesia has reported fewer consultations for Gastrointestinal and Enteric Syndrome, identifying Rotavirus, Salmonella, and Campylobacter as the primary causes. A recent incident affected 22 individuals during a gathering, prompting nine to seek medical advice; no hospitalizations were required. However, due to the absence of patient samples or food analysis, no microbiological investigations were carried out. An environmental inquiry suggested that the delayed serving of dishes between preparation and consumption might have triggered the outbreak.The CHPF sent samples to the CNR, identifying the dominant strain of Rotavirus A as G1P[8]. This strain differs from those predominantly circulating in France but is covered by vaccination. It's important to emphasize the significance of hand hygiene, especially after using the restroom, in preventing the disease among both adults and children. In 2023, out of 99 identified cases of salmonellosis, 28 led to hospitalization, including 3 requiring intensive care. Notably, hospitalizations affected all age groups.

Over the past decade, an average of 60 cases per 100,000 people has been reported annually. Since the beginning of 2023, there have been 102 cases, resulting in a 56.8% hospitalization rate and three fatalities. Common activities associated with infections include gardening, freshwater activities, farming, and hiking. Surveillance has been mandatory since 2007, with the latest update in week 44 revealing one confirmed case among 19 samples.

The flu season in Chennai typically occurs between September and January, with peak cases in October and November. Samples from 300 people with fever, cough, and cold were tested, with nearly half of them testing positive for Influenza A. Different categories for treatment and management of the flu have been established, ranging from symptomatic management for mild cases to hospitalization for severe cases. The survey also found an increase in respiratory ailments caused by other viruses and cases of dengue. As per the flu treatment protocols, those with mild fever and cough or a sore throat, body ache, headache, diarrhoea, and/ or vomiting fall under Category A CHENNAI: Influenza is hitting the city hard, resulting in the most hospitalisations in the monsoon months, according to the results of a sample survey done by the directorate of public health in Chennai.The flu season in Chennai is between September and January, peaking in October and November. âLike any other year, we are seeing an increase in fever cases, respiratory ailments, and vector-borne diseases such as dengue,â director of public health Dr T S Selvavinayagam said.Over the last few days, the state public health department on Anna Salai screened blood serum samples of 300 people who had fever along with a cold, cough, and body pain.Samples were drawn from one government and one private hospital, he said. Nearly half the samples returned positive for Influenza A â one of the four types of influenza. Among those with Influenza A, the most commonly seen strains were H3N2, which causes the common flu, and H1N1 (commonly called swine flu).As per the flu treatment protocols, those with mild fever and cough or a sore throat, body ache, headache, diarrhoea, and/or vomiting fall under Category A. These patients require symptomatic management. People with high fever, severe throat infection, and other symptoms of category A, children under five years of age, people above 65 years of age, pregnant women, people with comorbidities, and immunodeficiencyâshould be considered in category B. Doctors may prescribe the anti-viral drug of choice, oseltamivir, along with broad-spectrum antibiotics for these patients. Patients in both categories A and B must be advised to isolate themselves and rest at home to prevent the spread of infection and a quicker recovery.A more severe form of illness with breathlessness, chest pain, drowsiness, a fall in blood pressure, a high and persistent fever, and the worsening of any underlying chronic condition are tagged as category C. âSuch patients will require hospitalisation and the administration of oseltamivir and broad-spectrum antibiotics. It is important not to delay admission and treatment of patients in this category to prevent complications and death,â Dr Selva Vinayagam said.The public health laboratory also saw an increase in respiratory ailments caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and rhinovirus, besides cases of dengue and rarely Covid-19, said public health lab chief Dr S Raju.End of ArticleFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA Visual Stories Previous10 reasons to have 1 pomegranate dailyLifestyleScenic hill station train journeys in North IndiatravelIndiaâs famous tigers and tigresses: The legends of the wildtravelTips for guiding your child to greater happinessLifestyleHow to make South Indian-Style Mysore Masala Dosa at homeFood'Stree 2, 'Aashiqui' and other films of Shraddha Kapoor to watchEntertainmentAI imagines how India's top metros will look like in the next 50 yearsLifestyle15 Indian states and the rice dishes they are famous forFoodHow to extract, store, and apply fresh Aloe Vera to aid hair growthLifestyle8 hybrid animals that were âinventedâ by humansLifestyle Next123Hot PicksIllia YefimchykArvind Kejriwal BailAnnapurna Interactive Staffs ResignedEx-Miss Switzerland FinalistHaitian ImmigrantsStock Market TodayDelhi Greater Kailash shootingTOP TRENDINGPolaris DawnGK for StudentsVande MetroHamster Kombat Daily Cipher CodesShimla ProtestsKolkata Rape Murder CaseNitin GadkariAadhar Card UpdateGarena Free Fire Redeem CodeLargest Mammals in the WorldTrending StoriesIn CityEntire WebsiteThe Secret Behind NFL Marriages: How These Couples Make It WorkUPI transaction limit to change from September 16!

(George Rudy/Shutterstock)Social SharingIf you've noticed an uptick in colds, flu and COVID-19 — among children in particular — you're not alone.The medical director at Health Sciences Centre Children's Hospital emergency department in Winnipeg says there's an increase in cases of respiratory illnesses in kids showing up in the ER."Rhinovirus, COVID-19, respiratory syncytial virus [RSV], influenza — all the respiratory viruses — are really gathering steam," said Dr. Karen Gripp, a pediatric emergency physician and associate professor at the University of Manitoba.The latest numbers from Shared Health, which co-ordinates health care in the province, suggest influenza, RSV and COVID-19 levels haven't jumped overall in Manitoba as of mid-November. However, that isn't necessarily the case for young people.A Shared Health spokesperson said anecdotally, physicians at the Children's Hospital emergency department are seeing a jump in COVID-19 in particular, along with "noticeable increases" in influenza and RSV.Last weekend, 138 patients presented at Children's Hospital with influenza-like symptoms, up from 105 the weekend prior, the spokesperson said. Common symptoms include cough, runny nose, sore throat or difficulty breathing.At this point last year, Manitoba was in the midst of "the worst November that we've ever seen" for respiratory viruses in kids, Gripp said, due to a simultaneous rise in RSV, flu and COVID-19. The Children's Hospital was seeing about 170 children on average each day for parts of last fall, she said.'This is our COVID,' doctor warns as respiratory viruses strain Winnipeg Children's HospitalIn recent weeks, about 130 young patients have been presenting at the emergency room each day, with 40 of those patients experiencing flu-like symtpoms, Shared Health said. That figure is in line with averages at the Children's Hospital ER in November 2019, right before the COVID-19 pandemic began, said Gripp."That was the year we were seeing 200 [child] patients per day by the end of the year," said Gripp."What this means for next month and January [is] hard to say, but we're expecting things to get worse before they get better."Overall trends in ManitobaWastewater surveillance data suggests cases of COVID-19 were on the rise in Brandon and Winnipeg as of Nov. 9.There were 256 cases detected in Manitoba for the week of Nov. 5 to 11, similar to the 240 the week prior, according to the province's data.There were 59 hospitalizations and three intensive care admissions due to COVID-19 the week of Nov. 5 to 11, compared to 63 and three the week of Oct. 29 to Nov. 4. No deaths due to COVID-19 were reported during that two-week span.There were 33 cases of influenza A and B reported during the week of Nov. 5-11, more than double the 13 reported the week before.Overall, influenza and RSV levels in Manitoba remained low during the same time period, with emergency department and urgent care visits due to respiratory illnesses on par with averages in 2017 to 2019, according to Shared Health.Stemming the spreadOne way to minimize the spread of respiratory illnesses is for anyone who's sick to stay home and avoid visiting elderly or vulnerable loved ones most at risk to severe reactions, Dr. Gripp said.Masking up also helps, she said."If you do have to travel or go outside the house and you're unwell, wearing a mask can help protect others from yourself but can also protect you," she said.Washing hands, not sharing glasses or straws, sneezing and coughing into your shoulder, and keeping vaccinations for COVID-19 and flu updated can all make a difference, said Gripp.The kids most impacted by those two illnesses tend to be those who are unvaccinated, she said.Contrary to a common myth, Gripp underscored that you cannot get the flu or COVID-19 from getting vaccinated.Manitobans get vaccinated while provincial data shows slight increase in respiratory virus casesThe DoseCold and flu season is here — but doctors say antibiotics won't help you get better faster"We're expecting your body to respond and build up antibodies — that's the whole point of vaccination in general," she said. "Different people have different reactions to those, but it cannot give you COVID, it cannot give you influenza."Another myth is that fevers are dangerous. That isn't always true, said Gripp — it's generally a protective mechanism in the body, despite the fact a fever can make you feel "miserable."Bringing a fever down may help with comfort, "but having a fever is not a reason to rush to an emergency department, unless there are other concerning signs and symptoms," said Gripp.There are exceptions, however. Parents of children under three months old should consider taking them to an ER if they have a fever, Gripp said.Children who experience a fever for more than seven days should also see a medical professional at an urgent care centre, a family doctor's office or, in some cases, at an emergency department.Patients with respiratory symptoms who are breathing quickly or shallowly, are wheezing or are otherwise struggling to catch their breath should also be checked out, said Gripp.With files from Cory FunkCBC's Journalistic Standards and Practices|About CBC NewsCorrections and clarifications|Submit a news tip|Report errorRelated StoriesMarketplace How not to treat your cold; Your brain on social media: CBC's Marketplace cheat sheetFooter LinksMy AccountProfileCBC GemNewslettersAbout CBC AccountsConnect with CBCFacebookXYouTubeInstagramMobileRSSPodcastsContact CBCSubmit FeedbackHelp CentreAudience Relations, CBC P.O.

This respiratory illness is caused by the influenza virus and can range from mild to severe, with the potential for fatal outcomes. The highly contagious nature of the virus makes it imperative to address the need for flu vaccination in the country.India carries a substantial burden of influenza with outbreaks occurring throughout the year. The primary flu season typically spans from October to March affecting millions of individuals. The flu virus is easily transmitted through respiratory droplets, making it a constant threat to public health.5/11​Symptoms of the flu​The flu manifests a range of symptoms, including fever, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, muscle aches, headaches, fatigue, and sometimes vomiting and diarrhea. These symptoms can severely impact an individual's daily life and, in certain cases, result in hospitalization.6/11​Complications of the flu​The flu can lead to various complications some of which are life-threatening. These complications include pneumonia, bronchitis, sinus infections, ear infections, asthma attacks, as well as more serious events like heart attacks and strokes. Tragically, the flu can even lead to death, particularly in high-risk populations.7/11​High-risk groups​Several groups are at higher risk of experiencing severe complications from the flu. These include young children, older adults, individuals with chronic health conditions such as asthma, diabetes, and heart disease, pregnant women, and those with weakened immune systems. Protecting these vulnerable populations is paramount.8/11​The role of the flu vaccine​The flu vaccine is the most effective tool for safeguarding individuals against the flu. It is recommended for everyone above the age of 6 months. The vaccine works by exposing the body to a weakened or inactivated form of the flu virus, enabling the immune system to develop defenses against the virus.9/11​Yearly updates​The flu vaccine is updated annually to address the specific strains of the flu virus expected to circulate in that season. This proactive approach helps ensure that the vaccine remains effective in preventing infection.​Persistent pain in the legs is not normal; check why it might be happening​10/11​Benefits of flu vaccination​Getting a flu vaccine offers numerous advantages, such as:1.Reducing the risk of contracting the flu: The vaccine lowers the chances of falling ill due to the flu.2.Reducing the risk of severe complications: It can prevent serious complications that may require hospitalization.3.Lowering the risk of hospitalization: Vaccinated individuals are less likely to be hospitalized due to flu-related issues.4.Reducing mortality risk: The vaccine significantly decreases the likelihood of succumbing to the flu.11/11​Accessing flu vaccination in India​In India, flu vaccines are readily available in most hospitals, clinics, and even at certain pharmacies and schools. The need for flu vaccination in India is clear. Influenza poses a serious threat to public health, particularly among high-risk groups, and immunization through the flu vaccine is the most effective strategy for prevention. It is safe, accessible, and offers substantial benefits, ultimately reducing the burden of this contagious and potentially life-threatening virus in India. To protect your health and that of your community, getting a flu vaccine is not just a recommendation but a responsibility.(Author: Dr Anantha Padmanabha, consultant, internal medicine, Fortis Hospital, Nagarbhavi, Bengaluru)FOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA Visual Stories Previous10 seeds that are used as spicesFoodFrom Bold to Elegant: Rakul Preet Singh’s Style EvolutionindiaTaapsee Pannu redefines style with her stunning outfitsindia8 golden rules of a happy marriageindiaStunning pictures of Sai PallaviindiaAvneet Kaur’s perfect statement winter looksindia​10 unique things only Penguins can doindia8 signs your children are driving you into social isolationindiaMalavika Mohanan captures hearts with her breathtaking photos​india Next123 Bigg Boss BB18: Alice accuses Vivian for suggesting to use 'Women’s Card'BB18: Chum asks Karan about his struggles in the gameExcl- Nyrraa on BB18: Why Eisha, Alice weren't confronted?BB18: Vivian and Kashish clash over coffeeBB18: Rajat's controversial fights in the showBB18: Nouran slams trolls over rumours of Vivian consuming 'gutka'BB18's Hema had to sell her earrings to cover expensesBB18: Vivian orders Rajat to keep an eye on housematesArfeen refuses to shake hands with Avinash as he leaves BB18123 Photostories 5 reasons to wash hair with boiled guava leaf waterExclusive- Nyrraa M Banerjii reacts to Weekend Ka Vaar episode: Why Eisha Singh and Alice Kaushik weren't confronted for the kind of things they spoke​5 fruits that are high in protein (and how to eat them to get maximum protein)​How tall are Trump family members​7 things kids want to hear from mom and dad when they return from school​10 Countries with lowest IQ in the worldFrom Shoaib Ibrahim calling Bigg Boss no more a personality show to Divyanka Tripathi admitting it is not her cup of tea: Celebs who have refused to do the show'Bigg Boss18': From his intense brawl with Avinash Mishra to arguments with Vivian Dsena; Rajat Dalal's controversial fights in the show8countries where the Indian Rupee makes you feel rich123lifestyle videosShalini Passi has shaved her head four times!Shalini Passi has shaved her head four times!03:09Feeling sad and dissatisfied?

PHOTO: EPA-EFE Updated Nov 15, 2023, 11:33 AM Published Nov 15, 2023, 11:07 AM More Whatsapp Linkedin Twitter FB Messenger Email Print Copy permalinkCopy to clipboard https://str.sg/iNFy BEIJING - China is seeing the circulation of multiple infectious respiratory illnesses this winter, with surging cases of mycoplasma pneumonia, rising cases of influenza flu, but a downward trend in Covid-19 cases in recent days, said health authorities and experts on Monday. They added that people can recover from most respiratory infections without special treatment, but the elderly, children aged five and under and immunocompromised groups should visit hospitals promptly and take therapies as guided. Mr Mi Feng, a spokesman for the National Health Commission, said during a news conference that as winter approaches, China has entered the peak season for respiratory illnesses, and different viruses or pathogens are circulating simultaneously. “Efforts should be made to monitor the spread of mycoplasma pneumonia, Covid-19, influenza flu, as well as dengue fever and norovirus infections, to step up surveillance and early warnings so as to understand the spread of these viruses and their mutations,” he said. Mycoplasma pneumonia – a pathogen that commonly causes sore throat, fatigue, fever and a lingering cough that can last for months in children aged five and above – has drawn heightened attention this winter as hospitals nationwide have seen young patients swarming there to seek treatment. Dr Tong Zhaohui, vice-president of Beijing Chaoyang Hospital affiliated to Capital Medical University and head of the Beijing respiratory disease research institute, said regional epidemics of mycoplasma pneumoniae infections emerge every three to seven years. The pathogen tends to spread quickly in kindergartens and schools, and among family members, he added. “This year, the disease also inflicts children aged under three, but their condition is not more severe compared with previous years,” Dr Tong said. At his hospital, Dr Tong said, the positivity rate for the pathogen stands at around 5.6 per cent for adults and 40.3 per cent among children. He added that the increasing activities of the pathogen and other viruses are not unexpected. “During the Covid-19 pandemic, the spread of acute respiratory diseases appeared to be mild due to strict personal protection measures,” he said. “With the ease of virus containment measures, the circulation of these diseases has returned to pre-pandemic status, which is normal.” Dr Wang Dayan, director of the China National Influenza Centre administered by the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said flu activities across the nation have been rising, with H3N2 the dominant strain. In past years, the flu season for winter and spring usually runs from about mid-October to early March and peaks in January, she said. Dr Wang stressed that an effective way to prevent flu infections and reduce related serious cases and deaths is expanding vaccinations. More On This Topic Amid fresh wave of Covid-19, workplaces in Beijing navigate infection etiquette China scientists find clues that could crack mystery of long Covid Arrangements have been rolled out to facilitate flu immunisation among medical workers, the elderly, people with chronic diseases, staff at nursery and elderly care centres, schools, as well as children aged from six months to five and family members of infants. She added that flu vaccine supplies in 2023 have risen compared with in 2022 and are sufficient to meet demand. Regarding Covid-19, Dr Wang said the number of domestic cases has been on a downward trend since late August, and the positivity rate of the disease at fever clinics and hospitals is declining consistently. China reported 209 severe Covid-19 cases and 24 related deaths in October, according to the China CDC. However, Dr Zhong Nanshan, a prominent respiratory illness expert, said at a conference on Nov 10 that modelling shows that small spikes of Covid-19 infections will likely appear in November through to January. He suggested that the public, especially vulnerable groups, obtain updated vaccines as soon as possible.

Log in Subscribe Indonesia's defense minister and presidential candidate, Prabowo Subianto greets the supporters after registering himself for next year's presidential election, at the election commission headquarters in Jakarta, October 25, 2023. (Reuters/WILLY KURNIAWAN) Presidential candidate Prabowo Subianto on Monday criticized the European Union over its ban on palm oil imports and said Europeans during colonial times were also guilty of deforestation.The EU in April passed a law which would ban imports of commodities linked to forest destruction, including palm oil of which Indonesia is the world's biggest producer. Prabowo, who is leading opinion polls ahead of a presidential election next February, said Indonesia maintains "good" relations with Europe "although we have problems sometimes with the European Union". "We open our market to you," he said, citing Mercedes Benz and Volkswagen vehicles as examples. "But you won't allow us to sell palm oil, and now we have problems trying to sell coffee, tea, cocoa," he told a forum organized by the Centre for Strategic and International Studies. The European Union said in an email that it could not comment on statements by Indonesia's political candidates. "This Regulation is for everyone, in and outside Europe. It applies to commodities, not countries, and is neither punitive nor protectionist, but creates a level playing field," it said, adding it engages partners "so we can continue trade, but without deforestation." Until the ban, the EU was the third-largest buyer of Indonesian palm oil. Palm oil production is often blamed by environmentalists for deforestation but Prabowo said that during colonial rule, Europeans forced Indonesians to plant tea, coffee, rubber and cocoa and "you destroyed our forests before." Indonesia was a Dutch colony when it was known as the Dutch East Indies and an important source of wealth, thanks to the trade in spices. Prabowo said that if he wins the presidency: "I don't want protectionism, I want an equal playing field." Indonesia is a major producer of coffee, cocoa, rubber and timber products and about 6 billion euros ($6.41 billion) of its annual exports will be affected by the EU's deforestation law, its chief economic minister has said. The EU, Indonesia and neighboring Malaysia, the world's second-largest palm oil producer, have formed a task force to discuss the law.

Image: Sannika Michelsson / YleYle News14.11.2023 18:32Pharmacies in Finland have started selling home testing kits that can detect three seasonal respiratory illnesses, including Covid, influenza A and B and RSV (respiratory syncytial virus).Demand for the "tripledemic" tests has been high recently, according to Henni Timisjärvi, a pharmacist at the Avainapteekki pharmacy in the Munkkivuori district of Helsinki."Some suppliers have temporarily run out," Timisjärvi explained.The multiple test kits are similar to their single Covid home test counterparts, but at about 10 euros apiece they do cost more.Open image viewerPharmacies now sell home testing kits that can detect Covid, influenza A and B, and there are other tests that also detect RSV. Image: Ari Welling / YleThe Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) has advised that people can use home testing kits. But the test results should be treated with some caution, according to THL lead expert, Niina Ikonen.Ikonen said that she would not recommend home tests for generally healthy people with symptoms they can handle at home. For them, the specific virus that caused the illness is not necessarily important, she pointed out.The most important thing people with symptoms should do is to stay home and avoid contact with others, particularly the elderly.However, Ikonen said, taking a multiple test at home might be a good option for someone belonging to a risk group.If a test result is positive, the next step is to call a doctor for further guidance, Ikonen explained.Last week, THL reported that the number of Covid cases were rising in Finland. But, so far this season, only a small number of influenza and RSV cases have been filed at the National Infectious Diseases Register. Generally, RSV and influenza epidemics do not begin until the beginning of the new year.However, Ikonen warned people with symptoms to avoid visiting the elderly, as many respiratory infections — not just Covid or influenza — can cause serious illness in older people.Users with an Yle ID can leave comments on our news stories.

Hospital authorities note that children and the elderly are the most affected demographics, leading to a spike in respiratory tract infections, including pneumonia, cough, runny nose, sore throat, and body ache. Doctors from prominent medical institutions in Kashmir like SKIMS, SMHS, and CD Hospital have reported a substantial rise in cases of infections. President Doctor Association of Kashmir (DAK) and an influenza expert Dr Nisar-ul-Hassan attributes the increase to the dominance of influenza viruses, particularly H3N2 and H1N1, with H3N2 being the dominant strain. He emphasised the importance of vaccination as the primary defence against viruses. “Hospitals, including SMHS, have been conducting tests, and most results confirm influenza viruses. The influenza surge is affecting both young and elderly individuals, with severe pneumonia cases requiring oxygen and intensive care, including ventilator support,” Dr Hassan said. The resurgence of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is also notable, particularly affecting young children and posing a potential threat to infants and older adults. Dr Rafi Jan, former HOD at SKIMS and a professor at GMC, highlighted the “aggressive nature of non-COVID flu, linking it to environmental factors such as pollution and dusty roads in Kashmir. Individuals with pre-existing conditions like COPD and asthma are urged to take extra precautions”. Dr Jan emphasised the need to isolate individuals displaying flu symptoms, particularly advocating for the exclusion of children from schools to prevent further transmission. He recommended separating them from the elderly and individuals with pre-existing medical conditions within their households. Directorate of Health Services (DHSK) spokesman in Kashmir, Dr Mir Mushtaq emphasised the need for precautionary measures similar to those practised during the COVID pandemic. “Hospitals in Kashmir are witnessing a surge in patients seeking treatment for flu symptoms. Though it is not something which is a health concern, preventive measures are a must,” he said. Dr Mushtaq recommended the use of masks, maintaining distance, and adhering to coughing etiquette. “Additionally, parents are advised to keep symptomatic children at home to prevent potential outbreaks,” he said. As the flu season intensifies, health authorities and medical professionals are urging the public to prioritise preventive measures and vaccinations to curb the spread of respiratory infections.
