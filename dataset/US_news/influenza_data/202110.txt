Here we demonstrate in ferrets that 2015–16A/H1N1pdm09 vaccine strain A/Bolivia/559/2013 (A/BOL13) is outcompeted in trivalent (TLAIV) and QLAIV formulations, leading to reduced protection from wild-type challenge. While monovalent (MLAIV) A/BOL13 provided significant protection from wild-type virus shedding and fever at doses as low as 3.0 log10 fluorescent focus units (FFU), it failed to provide a similar level of protection in TLAIV or QLAIV formulation, even at a 6.0 log10 FFU dose. Conversely, clinically effective H1N1 strain A/New Caledonia/20/1999 provided significant protection in MLAIV, TLAIV, and QLAIV formulations. In conclusion, reduced A/BOL13 replicative fitness rendered it susceptible to inter-strain competition in QLAIV, contributing to its reduced VE in the 2015–16 season.

The initial hypothesized root cause for this low VE was low thermostability of the hemagglutinin (HA) protein of the A/H1N1pdm09 strain, A/California/07/2009 (A/CA09)6,7. A/CA09 was subsequently replaced with a more thermostable strain, A/Bolivia/559/2013 (A/BOL13). However, A/BOL13 demonstrated mainly low–moderate effectiveness in the 2015–16 season5, with high VE (65%) only seen in a single study8. Recent studies showed that A/BOL13 possessed HA thermal and pH stability profiles comparable with historic, clinically effective LAIV strains9, suggesting that factors other than HA stability were contributing to the reduced A/H1N1pdm09 VE.As a result of this reduced VE against H1N1 in the 2013–14 and 2015–16 seasons, the US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended that QLAIV not be used for the 2016–17 and 2017–18 seasons10. A series of investigations was subsequently initiated to identify the root cause of this reduced VE and facilitate identification of more effective strains.Initially, retrospective analyses of clinical data suggested that the VE of an individual A/H1N1pdm09 LAIV strain might be affected by varying vaccine strain composition. The 2013–14 H1N1 strain A/CA09 generated variable VE in different seasons5,8, being clinically effective in monovalent LAIV (MLAIV) form during the 2009 pandemic and in a trivalent LAIV (TLAIV) formulation in Canada in 2013–14, but showing low VE in TLAIV formulation in the USA in 2010–11, similar to the 2013–14 USA QLAIV. By contrast, during randomized controlled clinical trials, a pre-2009 seasonal H1N1 LAIV strain, A/New Caledonia/20/1999 (A/NC99), provided high efficacy levels in multiple TLAIV vaccine formulations11,12,13,14,15.In vitro investigations then found that post-pandemic A/H1N1pdm09 replicative fitness in fully differentiated primary human nasal epithelial cells (hNEC) was significantly reduced relative to pre-2009 LAIV strains16. This provided a plausible root cause for a generalized reduction in A/H1N1pdm09 VE. It also raised the possibility that less fit A/H1N1pdm09 strains could be outcompeted in multivalent formulations, providing a putative mechanism for composition-dependent reductions in VE. However, there was no in vivo evidence that reduced replicative fitness was responsible for reduced effectiveness and that the effect could be influenced by inter-strain competition.Consequently, we investigated whether the less fit 2015–16A/H1N1pdm09 strain A/BOL13 would provide inferior protection relative to fitter pre-2009 strain A/NC99. In addition, we assessed whether the reduced fitness of A/BOL13 would render it more susceptible to inter-strain competition in TLAIV and QLAIV formulations than A/NC99, providing a mechanism for its reduced clinical VE in QLAIV. Here, we present the findings from this crucial work identifying a direct role for reduced replicative fitness in low and variable A/H1N1pdm09 VE, informing subsequent selection of H1N1 LAIV strains for commercial vaccine formulations.ResultsA/BOL13 LAIV shedding is reduced relative to A/NC99To assess the importance of H1N1 fitness differences in terms of in vivo efficacy, ferrets were vaccinated with either A/BOL13 or A/NC99 in MLAIV, TLAIV, and QLAIV formulations. Initially, groups of four animals were vaccinated with 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, or 6.0 log10 fluorescent focus units (FFU)/strain and nasal swabs were taken daily for 5 days (Days 1–5) post-vaccination to assess vaccine virus shedding (Fig. 1). To reduce ferret numbers, a human 7.0 log10 FFU dose group was not included, instead focusing on lower doses with the aim of identifying limits of protection.Fig. 1: Study schedule for comparison of H1N1 LAIV of varying fitness in ferret model.a Composition of vaccine formulations.

This utilized all available timecourse data to produce a single data point per animal, for statistical comparison. These data clearly showed that MLAIV A/NC99 produced more infectious virus than MLAIV A/BOL13 (Fig. 2a). However, this was only statistically significant in the 6.0 log10 FFU dose group (P = 0.0003). Comparison of peak virus titers corroborated this (Fig. 2b), with A/NC99 reaching peak shedding levels 100-fold higher than those of A/BOL13 (P = 0.0078). This confirmed the A/BOL13 replicative fitness deficiency previously observed in hNEC16. Interestingly, while MLAIV A/NC99 shed significantly more infectious virus than MLAIV A/BOL13, viral RNA (vRNA) shedding for A/BOL13 was higher than that of A/NC99 (Supplementary Fig. 1a). Calculating the ratio of total virus (vRNA copy number) to infectious virus (TCID50 titer) in individual MLAIV nasal swabs showed that A/BOL13 generated 100-fold more non-infectious virus than A/NC99 (P < 0.0001, Supplementary Fig. 1b), providing a potential explanation for its lower fitness.Fig. 2: Monovalent A/BOL13 shedding is reduced relative to A/NC99 and all H1N1 virus shedding is inhibited in multivalent formulations.Comparison of virus shedding for all strains in A/BOL13 and A/NC99 formulations. a Geometric mean Day 1–5 shedding of monovalent LAIV H1N1 strains, measured by TCID50. b Monovalent LAIV H1N1 peak titer post-vaccination. c–j Shedding of all strains in monovalent, trivalent, and quadrivalent LAIV formulations, measured by multiplex RT-qPCR.

These data indicated no or delayed shedding of fully infectious virus for both MLAIV A/BOL13 and A/NC99 at 3.0 and 4.0 log10 FFU doses, relative to 5.0 or 6.0 log10 FFU. In addition, the trend for MLAIV A/BOL13 vRNA shedding in the absence of infectious virus could be seen across the timecourse at both 3.0 and 4.0 log10 FFU doses. A/NC99 showed a clearer agreement between TCID50 and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) kinetics at all MLAIV doses.In TLAIV and QLAIV formulations, shedding of vRNA for both A/BOL13 and A/NC99 was reduced relative to MLAIV (an exception was the 3.0 log10 FFU dose for A/NC99), with statistically significant reductions of ~100-fold seen at 5.0 and 6.0 log10 FFU doses (Fig. 2c and d). However, as RT-qPCR titers for both strains approached the limit of detection, comparison of the reduction in replication of each strain in TLAIV and QLAIV relative to MLAIV was not possible.Shedding of H3N2 and B subtypes in TLAIV and QLAIV formulations was also measured. H3N2 A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 (A/SWITZ13) geometric mean Days 1–5 vRNA shedding was detectable in A/BOL13 formulations, with no statistically significant differences between TLAIV or QLAIV except for the 6.0 log10 FFU dose (Fig. 2e). However, in A/NC99 formulations, A/SWITZ13 shedding was undetectable in most QLAIV-vaccinated animals (Fig. 2f). B/Phuket/3073/2013 (B/PHUK13) and B/Brisbane/60/2008 (B/BRIS08) shed more robustly than either A subtype in TLAIV and QLAIV (Fig. 2g–j), with B/BRIS08 producing the highest levels of vRNA in QLAIV-vaccinated animals (Fig. 2i and j).A/BOL13 serum immune responses are reduced relative to A/NC99Serum antibody responses were characterized by microneutralization (MN) assays at Days 7, 14, 21, and 27 post-vaccination. By Day 14, antibody responses had peaked for all subtypes and were sustained through Day 27 (Supplementary Fig. 5). A single representative timepoint, Day 21, was then selected to describe responses in individual ferrets by both MN and HA inhibition (HAI) assays.Both MLAIV A/BOL13 and MLAIV A/NC99 produced similarly high (10–12 log2) serum antibody titers by both HAI and MN (Fig. 3). However, while all A/NC99 MLAIV-vaccinated animals produced HAI and MN responses at all vaccine doses, one of four MLAIV A/BOL13 animals in each of the 3.0 and 4.0 log10 FFU dose groups failed to generate neutralizing antibody responses (Fig. 3b). This indicated that, irrespective of fitness, H1N1 strains delivered in MLAIV formulation could generate consistently high levels of serum antibodies at doses as low as 5.0 log10 FFU. At lower doses, magnitudes of responses remained the same but occurred in fewer animals, indicating a potential discrimination between more and less fit H1N1 strains.Fig. 3: A/BOL13 serum immune responses are more strongly reduced in multivalent formulations.Serum immune responses were measured by HAI and MN assays at Days 7, 14, 21, and 27 post-vaccination.

A/BOL13 A/Bolivia/559/2013, A/NC99 A/New Caledonia/20/1999, A/SWITZ13 A/Switzerland/9715293/2013, B/PHUK13 B/Phuket/3073/2013, B/BRIS08 B/Brisbane/60/2008, FFU fluorescent focus units, HAI hemagglutination inhibition, MN microneutralization.Full size imageCompared with MLAIV, in TLAIV- and QLAIV-vaccinated animals A/BOL13 generated considerably reduced serum immune responses (Fig. 3). This was dose-dependent, with the lowest vaccine doses producing the lowest response. In 3.0 and 4.0 log10 FFU A/BOL13 dose groups, no TLAIV- and only two QLAIV-vaccinated animals generated detectable HAI titers, versus geometric mean HAI responses of ~10 log2 in MLAIV animals at the same doses. The same trend was apparent by MN, but with low levels of response detectable in low-dose groups. By contrast, while magnitudes tended to be reduced relative to MLAIV, all A/NC99 TLAIV- and QLAIV-vaccinated animals produced detectable HAI responses at all doses. Indeed, A/NC99 TLAIV HAI and MN responses were statistically indistinguishable from MLAIV in 3.0 log10 FFU-vaccinated animals. This indicated that A/BOL13 was able to produce comparable serum antibody responses to A/NC99 in MLAIV-responding animals but suffered a distinct reduction in serum immune responses in multivalent formulations, most notably at the lowest 3.0 and 4.0 log10 FFU vaccine doses. A/NC99 was considerably less affected.In A/BOL13 formulations, H3N2 A/SWITZ13 serum antibody responses were consistent across the dose range by both HAI and MN (Fig. 3c and d). However, in A/NC99 formulations, A/SWITZ13 only generated detectable responses in TLAIV (Fig. 3k and l). B/PHUK13 and B/BRIS08 generated consistent HAI and MN responses in all vaccinated groups irrespective of formulation.A/BOL13 demonstrates reduced protection from influenza-like illness relative to A/NC99At Day 28 post-vaccination, all study animals were intranasally challenged with 5.0 log10 FFU of homologous wild-type (wt) challenge virus and development of fever was quantified as a measure of influenza-like illness (ILI). A control, unvaccinated group was included for each wt virus. Post-challenge Δtemp spline curves for A/BOL13 and A/NC99 are shown in Fig. 4a and b, along with individual fever values for statistical comparison (Fig. 4c and d). Fever temperatures shown are the average increase over baseline body temperature post-challenge, as described in the “Methods”. Temperature traces from two animals in the A/BOL13, 3.0 log10 FFU, MLAIV-dose group were corrupted and had to be excluded from this analysis.Fig. 4: A/BOL13 provides reduced protection against influenza-like illness.Change in ferret core body temperature was measured hourly from pre-vaccination to study termination. Change in individual animal body temperature versus baseline (Δtemp [°C]) following wild-type challenge for all animals is shown in a (A/BOL13) and b (A/NC99). Curves are spline fits to hourly data. Individual fever values are summarized in c (A/BOL13) and d (A/NC99). Temperature traces from two animals in the A/BOL13, 3.0 log10 FFU, monovalent LAIV-dose group were corrupted and had to be excluded from this analysis. Bar graphs show fever values from individual animals (symbols), four animals per dose group. Fever temperatures shown are the average increase over baseline body temperature post-challenge, as described in “Methods”. Columns and error bars show group median and interquartile range. Statistical assessment of fever was conducted using two-way analysis of variance with Sidak’s post-test correcting for multiple comparisons. All vaccinated groups were compared with unvaccinated controls. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001. LAIV live attenuated influenza vaccine, A/BOL13 A/Bolivia/559/2013, A/NC99 A/New Caledonia/20/1999, FFU fluorescent focus units.Full size imageUnvaccinated animals challenged with both wt A/BOL13 and wt A/NC99 developed significantly elevated body temperatures following challenge, with wt A/BOL13 temperature elevation beginning ~24 h earlier than that for wt A/NC99 (Fig. 4a and b). Median fever for unvaccinated animals was 1.43 °C for wt A/BOL13 and 1.15 °C for wt A/NC99 (Fig. 4c and d). MLAIV A/BOL13 vaccination significantly reduced fever in all treatment groups to unvaccinated levels. However, as seen for pre-challenge endpoints, a single animal in both 3.0 and 4.0 log10 FFU dose groups did not respond to vaccination, developing unvaccinated levels of fever. TLAIV and QLAIV A/BOL13 did not significantly reduce fever at any dose lower than 6.0 log10 FFU, with no indication of protection at 3.0 or 4.0 log10 FFU. By contrast, A/NC99 provided significant reduction in fever in MLAIV, TLAIV, and QLAIV formulations at all doses, relative to unvaccinated controls. However, the 3.0 log10 FFU QLAIV group did appear to provide lesser protection against fever (Fig. 4d).These data suggested that the reduced replication and immunogenicity of A/BOL13 seen in TLAIV and QLAIV formulations led to reduced protection from ILI following wt challenge at low vaccine doses.A/BOL13 demonstrates reduced protection from wt virus shedding relative to A/NC99To simulate patient sampling in test-negative VE studies, post-challenge wt virus shedding was assessed by nasal swabs taken daily on Days 1–3 post-challenge, with virus titers measured by TCID50 and RT-qPCR. Figure 5 shows wt shedding kinetics and geometric mean Days 1–3 shedding for statistical assessment of protection in vaccinated groups.Fig. 5: A/BOL13 provides reduced protection against wt challenge virus shedding.Shedding of homologous wt challenge virus was measured by TCID50 assay daily, Days 1–3 post-challenge. Shedding kinetics for individual animals are shown in a (A/BOL13) and c (A/NC99). Each curve represents shedding data from an individual animal (four animals per dose group). Wt virus shedding was expressed as the geometric mean of virus titer over Days 1–3 post-challenge. Protection from wt virus shedding for monovlaent, trivalent, and quadrivalent LAIV groups is summarized in b (A/BOL13) and d (A/NC99). Data shown are geometric mean virus titers for individual animals (symbols), with four animals per dose group. Columns and error bars for all virus titer data show group median and interquartile range. Statistical comparison between groups was performed by two-way analysis of variance with Sidak’s post-test correcting for multiple comparisons. Assessment of protection from wt shedding compared vaccinated groups to unvaccinated controls. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001. Dotted lines indicate lower limit of detection; values below this were plotted as 0.5× the lower limit of detection. A/BOL13 A/Bolivia/559/2013, A/NC99 A/New Caledonia/20/1999, FFU fluorescent focus units, GMT geometric mean titer, LAIV live attenuated influenza vaccine, NT nasal turbinate, RT-qPCR quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, TCID50 tissue culture infectious dose 50%, wt wild type.Full size imageMLAIV A/BOL13 vaccination provided significant reduction in median wt shedding relative to unvaccinated controls at all doses (P < 0.0001 for all groups). However, again, individual animals in each of the 4.0 and 3.0 log10 FFU dose groups showed no response to vaccination, failing to reduce wt virus titer (Fig. 5a).Similar to the results from assessment of fever, all A/BOL13 TLAIV- and QLAIV-vaccinated groups showed incomplete protection from challenge virus replication. Only a 6.0 log10 FFU TLAIV dose gave a significant reduction in wt virus shedding, relative to unvaccinated controls (P = 0.0015). Even in this case, median wt shedding remained in excess of 3.0 log10 TCID50/ml. By contrast, A/NC99 vaccination gave significant reductions in wt shedding in all vaccine formulations at all doses, with the lone exception of the 3.0 log10 FFU QLAIV group. This indicated that, in line with the loss of protection against fever already shown, A/BOL13 in TLAIV and QLAIV provided reduced protection against wt virus replication, relative to MLAIV, while A/NC99 was less affected.While fever and wt shedding endpoints were intended to simulate clinical VE study format, ferret respiratory tissues were also harvested for assessment of wt virus titer by TCID50 at Day 3 post-challenge. Challenge virus titers in nasal turbinate tissues provided similar observations to wt virus shedding, with A/NC99 conferring reduction in virus titer at lower doses than A/BOL13 in all formulations (Supplementary Fig. 6a and 6d). Due to insufficient volume for a subset of tissue samples, TCID50 data could not be generated for 4.0 log10 FFU A/NC99 TLAIV and QLAIV.In lung tissue of A/BOL13-vaccinated animals, wt virus was undetectable in MLAIV-vaccinated animals as well as the majority of 5.0 or 6.0 log10 FFU TLAIV- and QLAIV-vaccinated ferrets (Supplementary Fig. 6c). However, wt virus titers in lung tissues were generally low by TCID50, including in unvaccinated controls. For greater sensitivity, lung titers were also assessed by RT-qPCR (Supplementary Fig. 6b). By RT-qPCR, 5.0 and 6.0 log10 FFU TLAIV doses resulted in undetectable levels of wt vRNA in all animals, while two of four animals in both 4.0 and 6.0 log10 FFU QLAIV groups were similarly protected.For A/NC99, by TCID50, wt virus was undetectable in lung tissues even in unvaccinated control animals (Supplementary Fig. 6f). However, two control animals did give positive RT-qPCR readings (Supplementary Fig. 6e). Together, these observations suggested that successful wt upper respiratory tract infection did not guarantee development of lower respiratory tract infection by Day 3 post-challenge and that sterilizing protection of the lungs may be readily observed in this study format. This suggests that reduction in lung virus titer may provide an unrealistic assessment of LAIV clinical performance.A/BOL13 is susceptible to inter-strain competition in multivalent formulationsFigure 6 shows data from individual animals across the various study endpoints as heatmaps. LAIV shedding was excluded from this analysis due to the low levels of detectable vRNA in low-dose groups and multivalent formulations. Following MLAIV vaccination, A/BOL13 proved effective in most animals across the dose range studied. However, a single animal in each of the 3.0 and 4.0 log10 FFU dose groups failed to respond to vaccination, with uniformly low responses and protection by all endpoints (Fig. 6a). By comparison, MLAIV A/NC99 was similarly effective across the entire dose range (Fig. 6b).Fig. 6: Summary of endpoints demonstrates reduction in A/BOL13 efficacy in multivalent formulations relative to A/NC99.Data from multiple endpoints for A/BOL13 a and A/NC99 b vaccine groups were expressed as heatmaps. Each panel shows a single vaccine formulation (top to bottom: monovalent, trivalent, and quadrivalent LAIV, and unvaccinated). Each row represents an individual ferret, with four animals per dose group, with vaccine doses ordered from 3.0 (top) to 6.0 log10 FFU (bottom). Endpoints shown are, left to right: HAI titer; MN titer; geometric mean wt virus shedding (Days 1–3, TCID50); wt virus titer in NT tissue (TCID50); wt virus titer in lung tissue (RT-qPCR); fever (°C). All endpoints, irrespective of units of measurement, were normalized to a uniform 0–1 scale. Immune responses and protection equivalent to the average of the 6.0 log10 FFU monovalent vaccine group were calibrated to 0 (navy blue). Immune responses and protection equivalent to average data from unvaccinated controls were calibrated to 1 (red). White cells indicate mean of redavy blue. Gray cells indicate missing data points owing to insufficient tissue sample quantity or corrupt telemetry data. A/BOL13 A/Bolivia/559/2013, A/NC99 A/New Caledonia/20/1999, FFU fluorescent focus units, HAI hemagglutination inhibition, LRT lower respiratory tract, MN microneutralization, NT nasal turbinate, QLAIV quadrivalent LAIV, RT-qPCR quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, TCID50 tissue culture infectious dose 50%, URT upper respiratory tract, wt wild type.Full size imageIncorporation of each H1N1 strain into otherwise equivalent TLAIV and QLAIV formulations resulted in striking differences in efficacy. TLAIV A/NC99 retained an almost MLAIV-like profile, with all animals responding positively to vaccination and subsequently protected from wt challenge. By contrast, A/BOL13 provided no protective efficacy in the 3.0 and 4.0 log10 FFU TLAIV-dose groups, with all animals comparable to unvaccinated controls. These heatmaps also highlighted a generalized reduction in magnitude for all A/BOL13 endpoints, other than lung virus titer, at 5.0 and 6.0 log10 FFU doses. These differences were further exacerbated in QLAIV-vaccinated animals. For A/NC99, only the 3.0 log10 FFU QLAIV dose group showed a clear reduction in effectiveness relative to MLAIV controls, confirming the benefit of its increased replicative fitness in multivalent formulations.DiscussionHawksworth et al. previously showed that A/H1N1pdm09 LAIV strains suffered from reduced replicative fitness in hNEC, with A/H1N1pdm09 strain A/BOL13 producing peak viral titers approximately 100-fold lower than those of clinically effective, pre-2009 strain A/NC9916. Here, we further demonstrated that the reduced fitness of A/BOL13 was replicated in vivo, with similarly decreased levels of MLAIV shedding in ferrets relative to A/NC99. At low (3.0 and 4.0 log10 FFU) vaccine doses, animals vaccinated with MLAIV A/BOL13 began to lose protection, with 75% of animals protected at both doses, versus 100% for A/NC99. This small difference suggested that A/BOL13 infectivity in ferrets was reduced relative to A/NC99.Selection of the A/BOL13 vaccine candidate was based on its properties for HA protein thermal stability and virus yield in eggs. A/BOL13 was naturally thermally stable and did not require any stabilizing mutations that might have affected virus replication9. However, to obtain sufficient egg yield, the A/BOL13 HA protein incorporated the residues N119 and D186, previously identified in an A/CA09 high growth reassortant17. However, both A/CA09 and A/BOL13 suffered from reduced replication in human nasal epithelial cells16. It is possible that these residues, while increasing egg yield, could have had a deleterious effect on virus replication in human cells and ferrets, although this has yet to be demonstrated.Comparison of shedding by RT-qPCR (total virus) and TCID50 (infectious virus) suggested that MLAIV A/BOL13 generated significantly more non-infectious progeny than MLAIV A/NC99, wt A/BOL13 or wt A/NC99 (Supplementary Fig. 1). Earlier studies had demonstrated that multi-cycle infectivity (TCID50) for A/BOL13 in tissue culture was significantly lower than single-cycle (FFU) infectivity16. These observations suggested that the reduced fitness of A/BOL13 was at least partly due to a deficiency in fully infectious virus production.Gould et al. hypothesized that the high content of defective interfering (DI) influenza A observed in 2014–15 QLAIV FluMist sprayers may have contributed to the suboptimal 2013−14A/CA09 VE18. DI particles are spontaneously generated mutated viruses containing significant internal gene segment deletions, which can interfere with virus replication. Theoretically, high levels of DI viruses in a vaccine strain could reduce viral fitness and immunogenicity. However, more recent work suggests that DI viruses are not associated with low A/H1N1pdm09 fitness or VE19, and that A/BOL13 possessed a non-DI-based deficiency in infectious virus production.Recently, Dadonaite et al. demonstrated the importance of inter-segment interactions in efficient influenza virus genome assembly20. It is possible that the HA and neuraminidase (NA) gene segments of A/BOL13 might assemble less efficiently with the heterologous internal genes of A/Ann Arbor/06/60 master donor virus than the homologous internal genes of wt A/BOL13, leading to an excess of non-infectious particles. Understanding the mechanism behind reduced LAIV fitness remains an important question, and the effect of non-infectious virus content on VE continues to be an area of active study for our group.The incorporation of A/BOL13 into TLAIV and QLAIV vaccine formulations considerably reduced its in vivo efficacy relative to MLAIV. By contrast, fitter A/NC99 retained the ability to confer relatively greater protection in TLAIV and QLAIV. At study outset, our hypothesis was that a less fit virus subject to competition in multivalent formulations would require a higher vaccine dose to be efficacious. Cherukuri et al. had also shown that historic LAIV formulations remained immunogenic at doses lower than the 7.0 log10 FFU human dose typically used in ferrets21. The dose range applied here was thus intended to reveal lower dose efficacy for the fitter A/NC99, and a requirement for a higher protective dose for A/BOL13. Consequently, a 7.0 log10 FFU dose group was not included in the study in an effort to reduce animal numbers.The hypothesis was confirmed, as the minimum protective QLAIV dose for A/NC99 against both wt shedding and fever was 4.0 log10 FFU, while for A/BOL13 this was not achieved even at the highest 6.0 log10 FFU dose. This wide disparity in QLAIV efficacy showed that A/BOL13 was more susceptible to inter-strain competition than A/NC99. Furthermore, this showed that the reduced A/BOL13 QLAIV VE seen in pediatric clinical studies5 could be reproduced most effectively using low, multivalent vaccine doses. The 4.0 log10 FFU dose has since been selected as providing the greatest distinction between strains of differing fitness and applied to all ongoing work with this model. These data also confirmed that the clinically relevant endpoints of fever and wt shedding could describe the ability of H1N1 strains to induce serum immune responses and protect animals from wt virus challenge.The potential value of low-dose vaccination for describing inter-strain competition was seen in a recent study with an A/Leningrad/17/57 (LEN57)-based A/CA09 LAIV22. In this study, the A/H1N1pdm09 strain A/CA09 showed minimal evidence of competition in TLAIV or QLAIV in ferrets, conferring significant protection from challenge in both formulations22. However, LEN57 A/CA09 demonstrated variable efficacy, from zero to moderate, in TLAIV clinical trials23,24. While multiple factors likely contributed to this difference, the high vaccine dose (7.0 log10 50% egg infectious dose [EID50] for A strains, 6.5 log10 EID50 for B strains) used in this study may have precluded clinically relevant assessment of competition or efficacy in the ferret model22.Observations of varying efficacy between doses and formulations emphasize the need for accurate and comparable quantification of vaccine preparations. Here, vaccine formulations were titrated by fluorescent focus assay (FFA; see “Methods”), rather than TCID50 or EID50. FFA provides a rapid approach that can detect multiple virus subtypes with strain-specific antibodies, irrespective of valency. Titration of multivalent vaccines by TCID50 or EID50 requires neutralization of subtypes not being measured, prior to infection of cells or eggs, introducing potential variability. It should be noted that the vaccine material used in these studies was not commercially manufactured or titrated. As such, vaccine virus titers may have been more prone to variability than those used in clinical applications. This could have contributed to the inconsistent dose-response effect seen for A/BOL13 shedding at a 4.0 log10 FFU dose, where shedding in TLAIV was significantly lower than QLAIV. However, as these vaccine virus shedding differences did not correlate with protection endpoints, it is also possible that variations in nasal swab sampling and RT-qPCR measurement of shedding led to this observation.Another caveat to quantification by FFA was described in Hawksworth et al. where less fit H1N1 LAIV strains possessed lower TCID50 than FFA titers16. This indicated reduced multi-cycle infectivity in less fit strains and correlates with the observation of increased non-infectious MLAIV A/BOL13 shedding in ferrets. Consequently, any future vaccine candidates are now expected to show comparable TCID50 and FFA titers prior to incorporation into vaccine formulations.Having demonstrated the in vivo impact of reduced H1N1 fitness, the assessment of vaccine candidate replication in hNECs, along with comparison of multi-cycle versus single-cycle infectivity, is now integral to the strain selection process. Together these assessments are expected to reduce the likelihood of selection of low VE strains. Data correlating precise replicative properties of novel strains with efficacy in ferrets also continue to be gathered.While the primary goal of the work presented was to describe the effect of competition on H1N1 strains, reduced H3N2 A/SWITZ13 shedding and serum immune responses were also observed upon incorporation of A/NC99 into the 2015–16 QLAIV in place of A/BOL13. This suggested that competition could affect LAIV subtypes other than H1N1, although the clinical relevance of this is not yet clear.In a recent pediatric shedding and immunogenicity study, A/SWITZ13 in the 2015−16A/BOL13 QLAIV was shown to shed virus and generate HAI responses similarly to highly effective H3N2 strains25. This supported the detection of shedding and HAI responses in the same formulation presented here. However, minimal VE data for A/SWITZ13 in 2015–16 were available26, making correlation with VE difficult. There are no clinical or ferret efficacy data for A/SWITZ13 formulated with A/NC99 and it is unknown whether the reduction in A/SWITZ13 shedding and immunogenicity seen in A/NC99 QLAIV-vaccinated ferrets would have affected efficacy. Consequently, studies are being extended to describe the association of LAIV shedding and seroconversion with efficacy for both H3N2 and B viruses in ferrets.While the data presented demonstrate clear differences in A/BOL13 and A/NC99 efficacy in multivalent vaccines, there are potential caveats to the comparison of pre-2009 H1N1 and A/H1N1pdm09 strains. A/BOL13 wt challenge produced higher levels of fever and wt virus shedding than wt A/NC99. Different stringencies of wt challenge could have potentially influenced the relative efficacy of these strains. However, the fact that the reduced protection from challenge provided by A/BOL13 was mirrored in pre-challenge endpoints, mitigates this concern. Nonetheless, reproducing differences in VE between A/H1N1pdm09 strains with varying fitness and more similar wt challenge remains a significant goal and a subject of continuing research.Another key feature distinguishing our ferret model from clinical investigations, is that all work was performed in influenza-naive ferrets, while clinical VE data are generated from real-world populations with diverse ages and infection histories. In humans, frequencies of seroconversion and LAIV shedding decrease with increasing age or prior vaccination25,27,28 and an individual’s pre-existing immune landscape can influence the antibodies generated in response to influenza vaccination29,30. As A/BOL13 in QLAIV formulation generated variable clinical VE data5,8, we took a consensus view to allow evaluation in vivo, i.e. A/BOL13 in QLAIV should give lower efficacy than A/NC99 in ferrets. Reassuringly, the data presented support this generalization. However, our model might most accurately represent vaccination in young, seronegative children receiving a single dose of vaccine, as undertaken in the UK. Thus, it will be of great interest to examine the effects of prior infection or vaccination, or receipt of two doses of vaccine, on LAIV clinical outcomes using this model.This body of work has identified a number of important findings for LAIV strain selection. First, we have demonstrated that the reduced fitness of A/BOL13 rendered it more susceptible to inter-strain competition in TLAIV and QLAIV formulations than the clinically effective pre-2009 H1N1 strain A/NC99, identifying and demonstrating the likely root cause for the reduced clinical VE of A/BOL13 seen in multivalent vaccine formulations. Our findings also validate the use of fever and wt shedding as clinically relevant endpoints that can be used to measure the ability of H1N1 strains to induce serum immune responses and protect animals from wt virus challenge. Based on the understanding generated by this work and the selection of an H1N1 strain with greater replicative fitness (A/Slovenia/2903/2015), ACIP reinstated the recommendation for LAIV as an influenza vaccine option for indicated persons in the 2018−19 season10. Future work will be useful to further validate the clinical translatability of this model in real-world populations with diverse ages and influenza infection/vaccination histories.More broadly, the identification of inter-strain competition in the context of less fit vaccine strains highlights this as a factor to consider when developing other multivalent vaccines. Finally, defining a low, ferret-appropriate vaccine dose for LAIV reveals a key role for dose optimization and the use of ferrets as an animal model in broader pre-clinical vaccine development.MethodsCells and virusesAll vaccine formulations described were generated from non-commercial material for use in the studies. Madin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, used in FFA, TCID5, and MN assays, were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and passaged fewer than 20 times prior to use in analytical tests. No other cell line authentication was conducted. MDCK cells were cultured and maintained in Eagle’s minimum essential medium with non-essential amino acids at 37 °C and 5% CO2, as previously described16.LAIV viruses were propagated in the allantoic cavity of 10–11-day-old embryonated hens’ eggs at 33 °C. All were 6:2 reassortants carrying the six internal gene segments (PB2, PB1, PA, NP, M, and NS) of cold-adapted A/AnnArbor/6/196031 or cold-adapted B/AnnArbor/1/196632, and the HA and NA gene segments of the following viruses: Pre-2009 H1N1 A/New Caledonia/20/1999 (A/NC99). A/H1N1pdm09—A/Bolivia/559/2013 (A/BOL13). H3N2—A/Perth/16/2009 (A/PER09); A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 (A/SWITZ13). B/Yamagata – B/Phuket/3073/2013 (B/PHUK13). B/Victoria—B/Brisbane/60/2008 (B/BRIS08). Wt viruses were propagated from egg-derived wt as for vaccine viruses. Viruses were titrated by fluorescent focus assay (FFA) as described in “Virus quantification” of the “Methods” section33.FerretsAnimal testing performed by AstraZeneca/MedImmune follows requirements set out by the Home Office under the Animal Scientific Procedures Act 1986 and all work is performed under an appropriate project license. Ethical approval of the study was provided by AstraZeneca’s Council for Science & Animal Welfare (C-SAW) prior to study start. Work described here was conducted at Charles River Laboratories (CRL) Ireland Ltd, Carrentrila, Ballina, Co. Mayo, Ireland. F26 D786, in compliance with the European Directive for the Protection of Animals used for Scientific Purposes, Directive 2010\63\EU, as transposed into Irish law under Statutory Instrument, S.I. No. 543 of 2012 (as amended). Charles River Laboratories Ireland Ltd holds a Health Products Regulatory Authority Project authorization to carry out influenza testing in ferrets (AE19108/P022). This work was conducted under this authorization. The Project Manager holds a valid individual authorization from the HPRA (No. 19108\I079). All staff who performed procedures and euthanasia as part of this work were trained and hold valid HPRA individual authorizations to perform these tasks.Studies were conducted in outbred, mixed sex, specific pathogen-free, 14–26-week-old ferrets (Mustela putorius furo; Charles River Laboratories Ltd, Ballina, Ireland). Ferrets were confirmed seronegative for circulating H1N1, H3N2, and B viruses by HAI assay and randomly assigned to study groups. Animals were then housed in pairs with environmental enrichment. Each ferret was subjected to a health check on arrival at Charles River Laboratories and then daily during acclimatization, including twice-daily body temperature recordings. Post-inoculation, any adverse health observations were reported to and investigated by the designated veterinarian.Ferret studiesAt least 10 days prior to vaccination, intraperitoneal telemetry chips (Data Sciences International, St. Paul, Minnesota, USA: cat.ANIPILL 0.1C) were surgically implanted. Body temperatures were then remotely monitored hourly (Data Sciences International: cat.Aniview V2), from pre-vaccination to study termination.On Study Day 0, groups of four ferrets were each lightly sedated with isoflurane (C&M Vetlink, Annacotty, Ireland: cat.OVIV030) and intranasally vaccinated with a single 0.2 ml (~0.1 mlare) dose. Groups received either mock vaccination (phosphate-buffered saline [PBS; ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA] with 1× sucrose phosphate [ThermoFisher Scientific: custom product, cat.AC10210390] and 1× gelatine-arginine-glutamate [ThermoFisher Scientific: custom product, cat.AC10207676]), or LAIV in MLAIV, TLAIV, or QLAIV formulations, at doses of one of 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, or 6.0 log10 FFU/strain/animal, in the same sample diluent. FFA titers for all strains were required to be within 0.2 log10 FFU of the targeted dose.To evaluate LAIV virus shedding following vaccination, nasal swab samples were taken daily on Days 1–5 post-vaccination. Animals were anesthetized by intramuscular injection of 0.1 mg/kg Medetor (medetomidine; Chanelle Veterinary, Loughrea, Co Galway, Ireland: cat.PH003) before sedation with isoflurane. A Copan FloqSwab (Copan, Murrieta, California, USA: MINI UTM [Universal Transport Medium]) kit 1 ml (medium plus pernasal flocked swab, cat.360C) was inserted into the right nostril, rotated to ensure full contact with the mucosal surface, eluted by light vortexing in 1 ml of Copan universal transport medium and then aliquoted and stored at –80 °C. Medetor effects were reversed by intramuscular administration of 0.1 mg/kg Revertor (Chanelle Veterinary: cat.PH005), at least 30 min after the sedative.On Days 7, 14, 21, and 27 post-vaccination, blood samples were taken for analysis of serum immune responses. Animals were sedated with isoflurane as above and 2 ml bleeds were taken from the superior vena cava. Blood samples were transferred to BD Vacutainer SST tubes (Aquilant Ltd, Dublin, Ireland: cat.366882). Coagulation could proceed for 30–90 min. Tubes were then centrifuged and serum decanted to cryovials for storage at –80 °C.On Day 28 post-vaccination, animals were lightly sedated with isoflurane, as per vaccination, and intranasally inoculated with 5.0 log10 FFU of wt challenge virus in a 0.2 ml dose (~0.1 mlare). Nasal swab samples for wt shedding were then taken on Days 1–3 post-challenge, as for LAIV shedding above. On Day 3 post-challenge, ferrets were then euthanized by intracardiac injection of 1.5 ml of sodium pentobarbitone (200 mg/ml; Chanelle Veterinary: cats.MB0022, GA0022), and the lower left lobe of the lung and nasal turbinate tissues were harvested by standard methods. Tissues were ground with sterile pestle and mortar before adding 10× volume (v/w) of 2× Eagle’s medium, giving ~10% weight/volume suspension. Tissue suspensions were centrifuged and the 10–1 supernatant transferred to cryovials and stored at –80 °C. Telemetry chips were recovered from the intraperitoneal cavity.Quantification of feverThe initial factor influencing clinical test-negative VE study data is the self-reporting of ILI. To increase the clinical translatability of the ferret model, a quantifiable measure of ILI was required. To achieve this, intraperitoneal telemetry monitors were used to record core body temperatures for individual study animals hourly from time of vaccination to termination. Animal handling records identified all subsequent inoculation or sampling intervention times requiring anesthesia; corresponding hypothermic dips in body temperature were evident in pooled study data (Supplementary Fig. 7a). The period of 2 h pre-anesthetic to 10 h post-anesthetic was defined as ‘anesthetized’, representing the mean time between a short pre-anesthetic body temperature increase (due to animal handling) and a post-hypothermia return to normal temperature. These data were considered artefactual and were removed to enable accurate assessment of fever (Supplementary Fig. 7b). Post-challenge temperature profiles of individual animals were reconstructed using splines (fitted lines comprised of several quadratic curves) in JMP v13.0 statistical analysis software (Supplementary Fig. 7c). A spline ‘stiffness’ variable (lambda) of 5 × 1011 was selected to produce a root mean square error between 0.2 and 0.5 °C for most animals, based on the expected variability of the temperature measurements. The censored data were then replaced with the spline values, creating an interpolated series that approximated the body temperature expected if the animals had not been anesthetized.The average temperature profile of each unvaccinated control group (four animals) was then used to define the post-challenge ‘fever period’ for each wt virus. First, control animals’ time stamps were rounded to the nearest hour and an average hourly body temperature calculated. The fever period start was then defined as the first of three post-challenge time-points where the control group’s average body temperature was >1.5 standard deviations above its average pre-challenge baseline body temperature. Fever period end was defined as the first of three group average temperature measurements returning below the same limit, or study end if this occurred first.Hourly delta-temperature values were calculated for all animals during the fever period, subtracting the animal’s baseline body temperature from each fever period value. A single ‘fever’ value was calculated per animal using the average of all delta-temperature values during the fever period. This represented, for each animal, the average deviation from normal body temperature for the period that the wt challenge virus caused fever in unvaccinated controls.Virus quantification: fluorescent focus assayTitration of MLAIV, TLAIV, and QLAIV formulations, and wt influenza challenge virus stocks, was performed by immunofluorescent staining of infected MDCK cells. Confluent MDCK cells in 96-well tissue culture plates were washed twice in FFA virus growth medium (FVGM). FVGM was prepared from Eagle’s minimal essential medium (EMEM; Lonza, Basel, Switzerland, cat.12-662Q) with 50 µg/ml gentamicin sulfate (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA, cat.15750-078), 2 mM L-glutamine (Sigma, cat.25030081), and 0.5 µg/ml amphotericin B (Life Technologies, cat.15290018). Washed cells were then inoculated with 100 µl of 1:3 serial dilutions of vaccine preparations in FVGM. Duplicate plates were prepared for titration of each relevant subtype. Infected plates were then incubated at 33 °C for 18–20 h, in the absence of trypsin.Following incubation, cells were washed with FVGM and fixed with 80% acetone (VWR, Radnor, PA, USA, cat.100033P) in water, for 20 min–2 h at –20 °C. Fixed plates were dried at 36 °C for 30 min and then washed with PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 (PBST, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri, USA, cat.P-3563). Plates were then incubated at 36 °C for 1 h with subtype-specific, anti-HA protein primary antibodies, either obtained from the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control, UK (NIBSC), or produced internally at AstraZeneca. Primary antibodies were diluted in PBST with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma, cat.A-2153) and used to detect the strains described in these studies as follows: A/NC99—sheep anti-A/Brisbane/59/2007 (NIBSC, Lot: 10/120); A/BOL13—sheep anti-A/CA09 (NIBSC, Lot: 14/130); A/SWITZ13—sheep anti-A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 (NIBSC, Lot: 15/236); B/PHUK13—mouse anti-B/Yamagata, SP12-051 (AstraZeneca); B/BRIS08—mouse anti-B/Victoria, C14975 (AstraZeneca). Cells were then washed twice with PBST and stained for 1 h at 36 °C with fluorescent secondary antibodies diluted in PBST with 1% BSA: A strains—alexa 488 donkey anti-sheep IgG (H&L) (Life Technologies, cat.A11015), B strains—alexa 488 goat anti-mouse (Life Technologies, cat.A11017).Stained plates were washed twice with PBST followed by a single wash with sterile water. Washed plates were dried at room temperature for 30 min, and then fluorescent foci were counted using an Eclipse Ti inverted fluorescence microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) at ×100 magnification. Foci were counted in four infected wells for each strain; consisting of two consecutive dilutions on duplicate plates, each containing between 15 and 200 foci. The concentration of virus in the original vaccine formulation was then calculated.Virus quantification: TCID50 Quantification of monovalent LAIV and wt viruses in nasal swab samples was performed by TCID50 assay as a measure of fully infectious virus, as previously described16. MDCK cells in 96-well tissue culture plates were inoculated with 1:10 dilutions of nasal wash samples in the presence of 1:400 10xTrypLE (Life Technologies; Carlsbad, California, USA). Infected cells were incubated at 33 °C for 6 days and scored for cytopathic effect on an inverted light microscope. TCID50 titers were determined by the Spearman–Karber method34,35.RNA extraction and multiplex RT-qPCRExtraction of RNA from nasal swab samples was performed on the QIAcube HT automated platform, using the QIAamp 96 Virus QIAcube HT kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany: cat.57731), according to manufacturer’s instructions. RNA samples were eluted in 100 µl of buffer AVE and stored at –80 °C.To compare LAIV shedding between MLAIV, TLAIV, and QLAIV formulations in nasal swabs, a multiplex RT-qPCR assay was developed, with each vaccine subtype detected via its HA (BVic) or NA (H1N1, H3N2, BYam) gene segment. A total of 37 influenza A and 12 influenza B strain HA and NA sequences between 2009 and 2016 were obtained from the GISAID EpiFlu™ database (strains listed in Supplementary Table 1) and aligned using MegAlign Software (DNASTAR) to identify conserved regions exclusive to each subtype. These regions were targeted to design subtype-specific primer and probe sets (Supplementary Table 2). Primer and probe designs were tested for efficiency (efficiency of 90–110% accepted), screened for cross reactivity, and multiplexed to enable simultaneous detection of all four subtypes. Reference gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase primers and probes, described by Carolan et al.36, were then selected for sample normalization following an assessment of precision and sensitivity.For quantification of viral copy number, RNA reference standards were generated. RNA was extracted from LAIV material using the QIAamp 96 Virus QIAcube HT kit (Qiagen, cat#: 57731). One-step reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was performed using the SuperScript III one-step kit (ThermoFisher, cat#: 12574-026) incorporating T7 promoter sites to enable synthesis of negative-sense vRNA. The polymerase chain reaction product was purified using the Qiaquick purification kit (Qiagen kit, cat.28106) and RNA was in vitro T7 transcribed and deoxyribonuclease treated using the MEGAscript T7 kit (ThermoFisher, cat.AM1334). T7 RNA was purified using the MEGAclear kit (ThermoFisher, cat.AM1908). RNA was quantified using the Quant-iT kit (ThermoFisher, cat.Q33140). RNA reference standards were then diluted in RNA storage buffer (ThermoFisher, cat.AM7001) to 2 × 108 copies/µl and serially diluted 10-fold to 2 × 102 copies to generate a standard curve. All kits used in the synthesis of RNA reference standards were used according to manufacturer’s instructions. All primer and probe sequences are detailed in Table S2.Reverse transcription qPCR reactions consisted of 1× TaqPath™ 1-Step Multiplex Master Mix (ThermoFisher, cat.A28526), 250 nM of primers/probe, plus 12 µl of extracted ferret nasal swab RNA, and were made up to a total reaction volume of 25 µl with nuclease-free water (ThermoFisher, cat.10977035). Reverse transcription qPCR was performed in a one-step reaction using the QuantStudio™ 5–96-well 0.2 ml block. Cycling conditions were 25 °C for 2 min, 53 °C for 10 min, 95 °C for 2 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. Data were gathered and analyzed with the ThermoFisher Connect™ qPCR Design and Analysis Application. vRNA copies/mL was determined by comparison with a 10-fold serially diluted RNA reference standard of known concentration included on each 96-well plate.MLAIV infectious virus shedding was measured by TCID50 and RT-qPCR, while only RT-qPCR was used for comparison of shedding in MLAIV, TLAIV, and QLAIV formulations.Serum immune responses: HAIHAI assays were performed with standard methodology. Ferret antiserum (100 µl) was added to 150 µl 2× receptor-destroying enzyme (Deben Diagnostics, Ipswich, UK: cat.370013) and incubated at 37 °C for 18–20 h. Sodium citrate (150 µl of 2% w/v; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri, USA: cat.W302600) was then added and the reaction was heat inactivated at 56 °C for 45 min. Treated antiserum was serially diluted 1:2 and added to an equal volume of virus (8HAU/well). Virus/antibody complexes were incubated at room temperature for 30–40 min before addition of one-well volume of 0.5% chicken (H1N1 and B) or guinea pig (H3N2) red blood cell suspension. Virus/antibodyed blood cell mix was incubated at room temperature for 60 min and HAI endpoints recorded as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of antiserum able to fully prevent agglutination. If no endpoint was detectable, then a reading of 2 was recorded (1/2 lower limit of detection), to enable statistical analysis.Serum immune responses: MNSerially 1:2 diluted, receptor-destroying enzyme-treated antisera were generated in 96-well plates as per HAI. An equal volume of target virus (concentration 2000 TCID50/ml) was added per well, then incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Virus–antibody complex (50 µl; final virus concentration: 100 TCID50/well, minimum serum dilution: 1:8) was then transferred to washed 96-well plates of MDCK cells. Infected cells were incubated for 6 days at 33 °C and cytopathic effect measured. Neutralization endpoints were calculated as the reciprocal of the highest antiserum dilution able to completely neutralize virus infection. Duplicate assays were conducted, and neutralization titers were calculated as the geometric mean of duplicate endpoints. If no endpoint was detectable then a reading of 4 was recorded (1/2 lower limit of detection), to enable statistical analysis.Statistical analysisAnalyses are described in the figure legend.

Patel, MD, FAAFP, FACSM Share Print People from racial and ethnic minority groups are more likely to be hospitalized when they have the flu, according to an analysis from the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Minority groups at higher risk of health complications include non-Hispanic Black, non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native, and Hispanic or Latino. One reason these groups are at higher risk for flu hospitalization is because they are less likely to get a flu shot each year. Non-Hispanic white persons were most likely to get a flu shot. Hispanic or Latino persons were the least likely to get a flu shot, followed by non-Hispanic Black persons. The CDC reported these findings in FluVaxView. There are many reasons for this racial disparity in health care and flu vaccinations: Access to health care. Transportation and financial access are lower for minority groups and can discourage them from seeking medical care. This group is also less likely to have a usual source for health or dental care. Low-income individuals also may receive lower quality medical care, according to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Increased exposure. Hispanic or Latino Americans are more likely to be exposed to the flu because they work jobs where they interact more with the public. Crowded work and living conditions, where they often live with extended family, also may increase their risk of exposure to the flu. Being uninsured. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reports that only 55.5% of non-Hispanic Black Americans used private health insurance in 2017 compared to 75.4% of non-Hispanic white Americans. Lack of trust in doctors and traditional medical care. Many studies point to a lack of trust in doctors, especially among non-Hispanic Black individuals. This group often reports feeling that doctors will not act in their best interest. For this reason, they are less likely to have their medical conditions under control. Unfortunately, they are also more likely to have serious medical conditions like high blood pressure and diabetes. Path to improved health The flu shot is the best way to protect yourself from the flu. But vaccine hesitancy among racial minorities continues to be high. A lack of trust in healthcare means that many minorities believe the flu vaccine is not safe. Many health groups are working to change these attitudes about the flu shot. They aim to educate minorities on the safety and benefits of getting the shot every year. Vaccine safety The flu vaccine is safe. It does not give you the flu. There are very few side effects. After receiving the flu shot, your arm may be sore for a few days. You may have a low-grade fever, feel tired, or have sore muscles for a short time. If you received the nasal spray vaccine, you may have a runny nose, headache, cough, or sore throat. In many cases, the flu shot will prevent you from getting the flu. If it doesn’t, it will lessen your risk of getting a severe case of the flu. This means you’ll be less likely to be hospitalized from the flu. The CDC recommends that everyone 6 months and older get a flu vaccine every year. You should get the vaccine as soon as it becomes available each fall. You also can get it any time throughout the flu season (usually until March). It’s best to get it in the fall so that the vaccine can protect you throughout the flu season, but populations under 65 with no health conditions can get it as early as late summer when the vaccines for the year are approved. In the United States, flu activity peaks between December and February. The vaccine is available by shot or by nasal spray (LAIV4). The CDC recommends that people who have chronic conditions get the flu shot, not the nasal spray flu vaccine. Flu vaccines work by exposing your immune system to an inactive (killed) form of the flu virus. Your body will build up antibodies to the virus to protect you from getting the flu. The nasal spray vaccine contains active but weakened viruses. You cannot get the flu from the flu shot or the nasal spray vaccine. If you are 65 years of age or older, the CDC recommends that you get either a high-dose flu shot, or an adjuvanted flu shot, or a regular flu shot. An adjuvant is an ingredient in the shot that makes it more effective. The high-dose and adjuvanted shots are designed especially for the 65-and-up age group. Where can I get a flu shot? There are many places that offer flu shots. Where you decide to get a flu shot will likely depend on location and cost. Flu shots are available from your family doctor, from national pharmacies (such as CVS and Walgreens), at clinics, community health centers, urgent care centers, public health departments, colleges (free for students), some employers, and more. Cost for the flu shot ranges from free to around $50, depending on whether you have insurance (private insurance, Affordable Care Act, Medicare Part B). If you do have insurance, most of the places listed above will offer you a flu shot at no cost to you. If you do not have insurance, look for places offering discounted flu shots. Many national pharmacies offer coupons or other discounts for flu shots. Prices vary widely, so shop around. It can mean paying $19 or more than twice that. Look for online coupons, as well, or look for cost comparisons on GoodRx. Also, be prepared to pay up front before receiving the flu vaccination. If you want help sorting out where to find a flu vaccine near you, there are online tools that can help. Try looking on vaccines.gov. It uses zip codes to help you narrow the search. Things to consider Not only are people in racial and ethnic minority groups more susceptible to the flu, but they also have worse outcomes. Complications from the flu can be lethal. If you have any of these emergency warning signs of flu sickness, you should seek medical care right away. Difficulty breathing/shortness of breath Chest pain/pressure that doesn’t go away Dizziness or confusion Seizures Not urinating Severe muscle pain Severe weakness or feeling unsteady Fever or cough that improve but then return or get worse Worsening of your chronic health condition There are some people who should ask their doctor before getting a flu shot: People who have had a severe allergic reaction to a flu vaccine in the past People who previously developed Guillain-Barré Syndrome (a reversible reaction that causes partial or complete loss of movement of muscles, weakness, or a tingling sensation in the body) within 6 weeks of getting a flu vaccine Note: Children younger than 6 months of age should not get a flu shot. Questions to ask your doctor Can I get the flu vaccine? How do I know if I have the flu? Am I at higher risk for flu complications? What else can I do to protect myself from the flu? What should I do if I have the flu? Is it too late for me to get the flu shot? Can I get the flu shot if I’m not feeling well? Are there any vitamins of herbal remedies for the flu?

To understand how channel water mediates proton transport, we have investigated the water orientation and dynamics using solid-state NMR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. 13C-detected water 1H NMR relaxation times indicate that water has faster rotational motion in the low-pH open channel than in the high-pH closed channel. Despite this faster dynamics, the open-channel water shows higher orientational order, as manifested by larger motionally-averaged 1H chemical shift anisotropies. MD simulations indicate that this order is induced by the cationic proton-selective histidine at low pH. Furthermore, the water network has fewer hydrogen-bonding bottlenecks in the open state than in the closed state. Thus, faster dynamics and higher orientational order of water molecules in the open channel establish the water network structure that is necessary for proton hopping.

Substrate and ion transport by membrane proteins requires internal water molecules with the appropriate dynamics1,2,3. When water itself is transported, water–water hydrogen bonding dictates the rate of transport4. In contrast to most substrates and ions, protons are transported by water molecules as charge defects rather than atoms, by means of proton exchange and rapid rearrangement of water–water hydrogen bonds5. Transport of charge defects via this Grotthuss mechanism requires reorientation of water molecules and hydrogen bonds along the conduction pathway6,7. When the hydrogen bonding network is broken, for example, by polar amino acid residues in a protein, then proton transport can be prevented while water transport can remain, as in aquaporin8,9. When a protein channel contains more than a single file of water molecules and when proton conduction is predominantly unidirectional, then both water dynamics and water–water hydrogen bonding are expected to affect proton transport10. The interplay among water dynamics, water–water hydrogen bonding, and water orientation for proton transport is not yet well understood. This is partly due to the experimental challenges of determining atomic-resolution structures of membrane protein channels. Even when cryogenic-temperature crystal structures become available, usually only static snapshots of thermodynamically favored water are detected9,11,12. These snapshots reveal the oxygen positions of the structured water but not the disordered water, and the O–H bond orientation is usually unknown. In the absence of experimental data, molecular dynamics simulations have provided the main source of information about water dynamics and water orientation that underlie proton transfer6,7,13.The M2 protein of influenza viruses forms a water-filled proton channel14 that serves as a model for understanding how proton transport is mediated by the dynamic structures of water and protein. M2’s proton transport pathway is lined by four subunits of the transmembrane (TM) protein15. The channel is activated at low pH, when a central histidine residue becomes protonated16. Under this acidic condition, the histidine imidazolium rings, which are hydrogen-bonded to water, reorient on the microsecond timescale to shuttle protons from N-terminal water molecules to C-terminal water, causing proton flux into the virion17,18. A tryptophan (Trp) residue that is one helical turn away blocks the C-terminal protons from protonating the histidine, thus only allowing proton conduction from the N-terminus to the C-terminus19,20,21. Therefore, M2 transports protons using a mixed hydrogen-bonded chain between water and histidine. This detailed information about the histidine structure and dynamics in the influenza A M2 (AM2) protein was obtained from extensive solid-state NMR and crystallographic data17,18,22,23,24. In comparison, several aspects of the water structure and dynamics in the M2 pore have not been addressed. First, the water orientations in the closed and open channels are not known for M2, nor for most membrane proteins. Are water molecules partially oriented to permit Grotthuss hopping, and if so does the water orientation differ between the closed and open states? Second, it is not known how residues other than histidine affect the water–water hydrogen-bonding network. While AM2’s pore-lining residues are nonpolar, the influenza B virus M2 protein (BM2) contains three serine residues along its pore-lining surface (Fig. 1). This polar surface might be expected to affect protein–water interactions and water–water hydrogen bonding, in turn changing the proton transport behavior. Third, for BM2, how water dynamics differ between the closed state and open state is not known.Fig. 1: Equilibrated BM2 structures in the POPE membrane.a Closed channel with the His19 and His27 tetrads in the 0 and +1 charge states, respectively, to mimic their protonation states at high pH. b Open channel with both His19 and His27 tetrads in the +4 charge state to mimic their protonation states at low pH. For clarity, only three out of four helices are shown. Pore-lining residues Leu8, Ser12, Ser16, His19, Trp23, and His27 are shown as sticks. Water in the channel lumen is shown as sticks while water outside the channel is shown as lines.Full size imageTo answer these questions, we have now conducted solid-state NMR experiments and MD simulations on membrane-bound BM2. Solid-state NMR is an attractive method for obtaining experimental information about the dynamics and orientation of water molecules under biologically relevant conditions25,26. A direct comparison of water properties between the open and closed BM2 channels is possible due to our recently determined high-resolution structures of BM2 in lipid bilayers, where the 10 lowest-energy structures have a heavy-atom root mean-squared deviation of 1.5 Å27. These structures show that the four TM helices increase the tilt angle by 6° at low pH than at high pH, and the helices are on average 2.0 Å more separated from each other (Fig. 1). This uniform expansion of the BM2 pore at low pH correlates with the ability of BM2 to conduct protons bidirectionally, down the concentration gradient, like a canonical ion channel. In comparison, AM2’s TM domain exhibits a helical kink at G34, which acts as a hinge to alternate water access to the N- or C-terminal halves of the pore11,24. This distinct conformational motion correlates with AM2’s function to conduct protons strictly inward, like a transporter. On the basis of the open and closed BM2 structures, we now investigate the dynamics and orientations of water molecules in the BM2 pore. We conduct solid-state NMR experiments and MD simulations at 273–277 K, where both disordered and structured water molecules are present. We show that BM2’s pore is several water molecules wide with many possible hydrogen-bonding pathways. Solid-state NMR data show that water in the low-pH BM2 channel exhibits faster reorientations as well as higher orientational order compared to the high-pH channel. This unexpected result suggests that water undergoes rapid small-amplitude reorientations to mediate proton conduction. MD simulations give consistent findings about the relationship between water orientation and dynamics, and indicate that this relationship is controlled by the proton-selective histidine residue.ResultsBM2 conducts protons at low pH, when the proton-selective histidine (H19) tetrad becomes protonated. A second, membrane-surface histidine (H27) is also protonated at low pH, but is not essential for proton conduction28,29. Experimentally, the closed and open states are accessible by controlling the pH of the membrane samples to pH 7.5 (“high pH”) and pH 4.5 (“low pH”), respectively. These conditions lead to average protonation states of 0/+1 for the H19/H27 tetrads at pH 7.5 and +4/+4 at pH 4.5, based on measured pKa values29,30. For all-atom MD simulations of the solvated BM2 channel, we represent the closed and open channels by charge states of 0/+1 (closed0/+1) and +4/+4 (open+4/+4) for H19/H27, respectively, while the pH was not directly controlled. Simulations were initialized with the energy-minimized 1.5 Å experimental structures of BM2 tetramers in a POPE bilayer, matching experimental conditions (see Methods section; Supplementary Fig. 1a, b). Both charge states (Fig. 1) were stable, with Cα root mean-squared deviations (RMSDs) of 2.3–2.4 Å (Supplementary Fig. 1c, d). Channel-water dynamics were analyzed from four independent 100 ns MD trajectories for each channel. Below, we present findings from solid-state NMR experiments and MD simulations in parallel to facilitate comparison.The BM2 channel pore is more hydrated at low pH than at high pHWe measured the amount of water in the high-pH and low-pH BM2 channels using 13C-detected water 1H polarization transfer experiments (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 2a). The water 1H magnetization was selected by a soft 1H excitation pulse followed by a 0.286-ms 1H T2′ filter, then transferred to protein protons during a mixing time, τmix. The transferred magnetization was detected through protein 13C signals25,26. All aliphatic 13C intensities were integrated for the buildup curve analysis. The intensity ratio between spectra measured at short and long mixing times is inversely proportional to the protein–water distance (Supplementary Method, Eq. 7), whereas the relative intensities of the closed and open channels in the short-τmix limit reflect the relative magnitude of the product of the water amount and the square root of the effective spin diffusion coefficient (Supplementary Method, Eq. 5). This effective spin diffusion coefficient depends on both the chemical exchange rate and the 1H spin diffusion coefficient26,31. It is known that chemical exchange between water and labile protein protons is slower at low pH than at high pH. For example, labile imidazole protons have hydrogen exchange rates of ~100,000 s−1 at pH 7.5 but only ~10,000 s−1 at pH 4.518,32, and the indole HN proton of Trp has a hydrogen exchange rate of ~10 s−1 at pH 7.5 but only ~0.1 s−1 at pH 4.5 (ref. 33). Serine hydroxyls have similar hydrogen exchange rates at pH 4.5 and pH 7.5, but both are slow at ~300 s−1 (ref. 34). Finally, exchange of protected amide protons with water is expected to be too slow to affect magnetization transfer on the millisecond timescale of τmix used here35. Despite the slower chemical exchange rates at low pH, the pH 4.5 BM2 sample shows faster polarization transfer buildup rates than the pH 7.5 sample (Fig. 2a, b and Supplementary Data 1), indicating that the low-pH channel pore contains more water36,37. The intensity ratios between the low-pH and high-pH samples extrapolate to 1.95 at vanishing τmix (Fig. 2c), indicating that the low-pH channel contains at least 1.95 times as much water as the high-pH channel.Fig. 2: Experimental and simulated water amounts in closed and open BM2 channels.a Water-transferred 13C spectra with 2 ms and 100 ms 1H mixing times at pH 7.5 and pH 4.5. Note the higher intensities of the 2-ms spectrum of the low-pH sample compared to the high-pH sample. b Normalized water-transferred intensity (S/S0) as a function of mixing time τmix. The protein shows faster intensity buildup at low pH than at high pH. c Ratio of the low-pH versus high-pH water-transferred intensities as a function of 1H mixing time. The ratio has an intercept of 1.95 (blue dashed line), indicating that the low-pH channel contains at least 1.95-fold more water than the high-pH channel. d Simulated average number of water molecules in 4 Å bins along the channel axis in the open (red) and closed (black) states. A ribbon view of the BM2 TM domain is shown on the left to illustrate the positions of key residues (sticks). For clarity, only two out of four TM helices are shown. e Ratio of the simulated number of water molecules for the open and closed states in 4 Å bins along the channel axis. On average, 2.0 times more water molecules are found in the open channel (blue dashed line), consistent with the experimental data. Black squares and error bars for simulations correspond to the mean and standard error of the mean for four independent trajectories. The data from the individual trajectories are shown as open orange circles.Full size imageMD simulations yielded both average and site-specific information about the number of water molecules in the open and closed states. We found that the open+4/+4 BM2 channel contains 120 ± 7 water molecules from a channel-axis coordinate of −16 Å to +16 Å, while the closed0/+1 channel contains 60 ± 5 water molecules (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Movie 1). Thus, the number of water molecules is 2.0 times higher in the low-pH channel than the high-pH channel (Fig. 2e), in excellent agreement with the experimentally measured ratio of water amounts. The number of water molecules increases the most near the hydrophobic valve formed by L8, and in the H19-W23 proton conduction motif. This increase in water density coincides with an increase in the channel diameter near those residues (Supplementary Fig. 1b).Water motions are faster in the open channel than the closed channelTo investigate water dynamics in the low-pH and high-pH BM2 channels, we measured water protons’ apparent transverse relaxation times (T2′) and rotating-frame relaxation rates (R1ρ). The T2′ values are sensitive to picosecond (ps) to nanosecond (ns) motions while the R1ρ values are sensitive to microsecond (μs) to millisecond (ms) motions. These relaxation rates were measured at a sample temperature of 273 K to minimize chemical exchange between water and labile protein protons. Based on the composition of our membrane samples, about two thirds of all water is bulk-like, one third is associated with the membrane surface, and only ~2% is within the channel25. We define bulk-like water as highly dynamic interlamellar water that does not exchange with the lipid headgroup or protein protons, but that is still not as mobile as isotropic bulk water. We used 1H-detected NMR experiments to probe the dynamics of the bulk-like and lipid-associated water (Supplementary Fig. 3a, b) and 13C-detected experiments to probe the dynamics of channel water near protein residues (Supplementary Fig. 2a, b).At low pH, the 1H-detected water T2′s are 48 ms for bulk-like water and 2.2 ms for lipid-associated water (Supplementary Fig. 3e and Supplementary Table 1). The fast relaxation of the lipid-associated water is consistent with retardation of water dynamics by the membrane surface and chemical exchange of water protons with labile lipid headgroup protons. In comparison, 13C-detected channel water displays an intermediate T2′ of 5.5 ± 0.1 ms at low pH (Fig. 3a, b), and the value decreases to 4.0 ± 0.1 ms at high pH. Transverse relaxation is driven by molecular tumbling38, with slower relaxation indicative of shorter rotational correlation times (τrot). Because the channel-bound water has a small degree of orientational anisotropy (vide infra), coherent effects can accelerate the apparent transverse relaxation compared to that caused by molecular tumbling alone. Despite this coherent contribution, we can estimate an upper limit of τrot using the Bloembergen-Purcell-Pound (BPP) theory (Eq. 2, Methods section)38. The upper limit τrot values that correspond to these 13C-detected water 1H T2′s are 5.5 ns for the low-pH water and 7.6 ns for the high-pH channel water. Both correlation times are an order of magnitude longer than the 1H-detected bulk-like water τrot of 0.5–0.7 ns (Supplementary Table 1). Thus, the channel-water dynamics is highly restricted compared to bulk-like water. But even the bulk-like water in these hydrated liposomes is much less mobile than true bulk water, which has been reported to have a correlation time of 5.8 ps at 275 K39. We searched for residue-specific differences in the channel-water dynamics. However, even at a very short 1H mixing time of 0.1 ms, all 13C-detected 1H T2′ values are similar, indicating that water translational diffusion and 1H spin diffusion are rapid on this timescale, thus obscuring site-specific differences. Therefore, for the 13C-detected water 1H T2′ relaxation measurements, we used a 4-ms 1H mixing time and integrated the aliphatic 13C intensities to increase the sensitivity of the measurement.Fig. 3: Rotational and translational diffusion of water in BM2 channels.a Representative 13C-detected NMR spectra probing water 1H T2′ at pH 7.5 and pH 4.5. These spectra were measured with total echo delays of 0.14 ms and 7.14 ms. b Channel-water 1H T2′ relaxation decay curves.

In the open state, water near H19 has the longest τrot. In the closed state, water near L8 has the longest τrot. g Total number of water molecules transported across the channel in both directions for the high-pH and low-pH states. Error bars for simulations are the standard error of the mean for four independent trajectories.Full size imageTo investigate slower dynamics of the channel water, we measured water 1H R1ρ dispersion with protein 13C detection, which distinguishes the protein-proximal channel water from bulk-like water and lipid-associated water (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 2b)40. If two water populations with different isotropic chemical shifts exchange on the μs to ms timescale, then R1ρ relaxation rates will vary with the spin-lock field strength in the kilohertz range. Relaxation is faster under weaker spin-lock field strengths and slower under stronger spin-lock fields. The intrinsic rotating-frame spin-lattice relaxation rate (R1ρ0) is obtained in the limit of infinitely strong spin-lock fields41. Figure 3d shows that both the high-pH and low-pH channel water displays significant R1ρ dispersion in a spin-lock field strength range of 3–71 kHz. Fitting the profile using a two-state model42 (Supplementary Method) yielded exchange time constants (τex) of 5.2 ± 0.3 μs for the low-pH sample and 9.5 ± 0.9 μs for the high-pH sample. The fitting also yielded an exchange amplitude (ϕex) of 2.6 ± 0.2 × 107 rad2s−2 for the low-pH sample and 1.9 ± 0.2 × 107 rad2s−2 for the high-pH sample. The exchange amplitude depends on the populations of the two states (p1 and p2) and chemical shift difference (∆ω) according to ϕex = p1p2∆ω2. Assuming comparable populations, these τex values indicate a 1H chemical shift differences of ~2 ppm between the two populations of water. Based on considerations of the chemical exchange rates, we attribute the exchange process to that between two pools of water molecules in the channel pore (Supplementary Method)43,44. Importantly, this exchange process is 2-fold faster in the low-pH channel than in the high-pH channel. In comparison, bulk-like water shows no R1ρ relaxation dispersion while the lipid-associated water exhibits only minimal dispersion, which is independent of pH (Supplementary Fig. 3c, d, f). Finally, the intrinsic relaxation rate R1ρ0 is 2–10-fold faster for the channel water than the bulk-like and lipid-associated water (Supplementary Table 2), indicating that channel-water motion is more restricted than bulk-like and lipid-associated water45,46.MD simulations of water rotational dynamics are fully consistent with these experimental results. In both the open+4/+4 and closed0/+1 channel, the rotational correlation of water decays over two distinct timescales (Fig. 3e). We attribute the fast decay within ~10 ps to thermal motion of bulk-like water, and the slow decay to motion of the hydrogen-bonded water molecules in the confined pore and interactions of water with protein residues. Due to the time resolution used in the analysis of the MD simulations, we cannot further comment on the sub-10-ps rotational time, although it is possible that this motion is also affected by confinement within the channel47,48. The long-time relaxation component is slower for the closed0/+1 state than the open+4/+4 state, with an average τrot of 253 ± 12 ps for the closed channel and 223 ± 6 ps for the open+4/+4 channel. Moreover, the slow-component’s τrot values are not uniform throughout the channel (Fig. 3f): the slowest rotational dynamics is observed for water near L8 in the closed0/+1 state and for water near H19 in the open+4/+4 state.We also examined water flux through the channel, by counting the number of water molecules that entered the channel on one side and exited at the other side (counted as one transport event). The open+4/+4 channel transports 1.19 ± 0.24 water molecules per nanosecond (averaged over both directions) while the closed0/+1 channel transports only 0.04 ± 0.03 water molecules per nanosecond (Fig. 3g and Supplementary Movie 1). The 30-fold reduction of the number of transported water molecules by the closed channel is striking. In addition, a water molecule takes 7.6 ± 0.2 ns on average to pass through the open+4/+4 channel and 26 ± 3.4 ns to pass through the closed0/+1 channel. The lifetime of an excess proton on hydronium ions is only a few ps49. Therefore, water translational diffusion through the channel is too slow to be the dominant process for proton transport, supporting the H19-mediated proton shuttling mechanism. We next computed the mean-squared displacement (MSD) of water molecules in the channel (Supplementary Fig. 4b), and fit it to the equation \({\mathrm{MSD}}\left( t \right) = 6Dt^\alpha\), where the prefactor \(D\) corresponds to the water translational diffusion coefficient when the exponent \(\alpha = 1\). We find that the water translational motion is sub-diffusive in both channels (α < 1), but the dynamics are even slower in the closed0/+1 state than in the open+4/+4 state (Supplementary Fig. 4c). The differences in the water dynamics between the open+4/+4 state and closed0/+1 state are illustrated in Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. 5.Fig. 4: Representative snapshots of rotational and translational diffusion of water molecules within 3Å of H19.a Water molecules near H19 in the closed0/+1 channel. b Water molecules near H19 in the open+4/+4 channel. The composite views at the bottom are taken in 10 ps steps over a 100-ps interval. For clarity, the oxygens of individual water molecules are colored differently. c Zoomed-in views of the trajectories of individual water molecules highlighted in a and b.Full size imageWater is more oriented in the open BM2 channel than in the closed channelWater rotational diffusion can facilitate the making and breaking of hydrogen bonds. If the hydrogen-bonded network differs between the closed and open channels, then we would expect the water orientations to differ as well. In general, water in hydrated membranes is expected to be predominantly isotropic on NMR timescales. Even if there is anisotropy for the 2% of water that resides in the channel, this anisotropy is expected to be small and hence difficult to measure accurately by conventional lineshape experiments50. Therefore, we probed channel-water orientation using 1H spin-lock recoupling experiments51 (Supplementary Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 3c). Using spin-lock rf field strengths (ω1) that fulfill three recoupling conditions, ω1 = 0.5ωr, ωr, and 2ωr, where ωr is the MAS frequency52, we selectively recouple nuclear spin interactions. For water, at the ω1 = ωr and 2ωr conditions, 1H chemical shift anisotropy (CSA) is recoupled, while at the ω1 = 0.5ωr and ωr conditions, 1H–1H dipolar couplings are recoupled. The recoupled interactions should cause coherent oscillations of the time-dependent intensity decays, which can be fit to extract the motionally averaged anisotropies. The rigid-limit water 1H CSA is 28.5 ppm53, which corresponds to 22.8 kHz at 800 MHz, while the rigid-limit 1H–1H dipolar coupling within each water molecule is 35 kHz. As before, 13C detection allows us to selectively detect water molecules inside the channel, near protein residues.Figure 5a shows the 13C-detected channel-water 1H intensity decays under spin-lock recoupling. For both low- and high-pH samples, we observed clear oscillations at ω1 = ωr and 2ωr but not at ω1 = 0.5ωr, indicating that the channel water has finite motionally averaged 1H CSA but vanishing 1H–1H dipolar couplings. The latter can be understood by proton exchange between water molecules, which averages the intramolecular 1H–1H dipolar coupling. To verify that the oscillations at ω1 = ωr and 2ωr are indeed due to 1H CSA, we conducted the REfocused CSA Rotating-frame Relaxation (RECRR) experiment, which refocuses the CSA using phase-inverted spin-lock and 180° pulses (Supplementary Fig. 2d)54. Indeed, RECRR abolished most of the oscillations at ω1 = ωr and 2ωr while retaining the same smooth decay at ω1 = 0.5ωr (Fig. 5b), confirming that 1H CSA is the main mechanism of the coherent oscillation.Fig. 5: Channel-water orientational order in BM2 from 13C-detected 1H spin-lock recoupling NMR experiments and MD simulations.a 13C-detected water 1H spin-lock recoupling data at ω1 = 0.5ωr (left), ωr (middle) and 2ωr (right). The spectral region integrated for each data point is shown in the inset for representative spin-lock times. Coherent oscillations are observed at ωr and 2ωr but not at 0.5ωr, indicating that 1H CSA is the dominant anisotropic interaction. b Comparison of 13C-detected water 1H RECRR data (open squares) and CW spin-lock recoupling data (filled circles) at the three recoupling conditions.

An orientation change is observed at residue A17 at low pH. f Time-averaged cosθOH of channel water when the +4/+4 state is restrained to the high-pH solid-state NMR protein structure (PDB: 6PVR) and the 0/+1 state is restrained to the low-pH solid-state NMR structure (PDB: 6PVT). Positive <cosθOH> near W23 and negative <cosθOH> near L8 are observed for the +4/+4 state despite the high-pH structure. Error bars for simulations are the standard error of the mean for four independent trajectories.Full size imageTo compare the channel-water anisotropy with the anisotropy of lipid protons and other water protons, we conducted the spin-lock recoupling experiments with 1H detection (Supplementary Fig. 3). The lipid CH2 and CH3 protons exhibit coherent oscillations at ω1 = 0.5ωr and ωr but negligible oscillation at ω1 = 2ωr (Supplementary Fig. 3g). This is consistent with the fact that lipid chains are anisotropically mobile and each CH2 group has significant geminal 1H–1H dipolar couplings while the 1H CSA is weak55,56. The total water 1H signal in the 1H spectra shows coherent oscillations at ω1 = ωr and 2ωr but not at ω1 = 0.5ωr (Supplementary Fig. 3f), similar to the 13C-detected channel-water behavior, indicating CSA recoupling. However, the minima of the total water oscillations are much higher than the minima of 13C-detected channel-bound water (Fig. 5a), indicating that only a fraction of all water is anisotropic. We attribute this anisotropy to water interacting with the membrane surface.Importantly, the 13C-detected 1H spin-lock recoupling data indicate that the CSA-induced oscillation is faster at low pH than at high pH (Fig. 5a), indicating that the water orientational order is larger in the low-pH channel than in the high-pH channel. Although 1H CSA is the dominant coherent effect for water, contributions from 1H–1H homonuclear dipolar couplings can speed up the dephasing at the ωr recoupling condition51; therefore, we report CSA parameters extracted from the 2ωr matching conditions to compare the water CSAs between the high- and low-pH samples. Fitting the oscillations by numerical simulations (Supplementary Fig. 6) yielded a motionally averaged 1H CSA of 1.8 ± 0.2 ppm at low pH and 1.2 ± 0.2 ppm at high pH for the ω1 = 2ωr condition. These values correspond to order parameters SCSA of 0.063 ± 0.007 at low pH and 0.042 ± 0.007 at high pH53.We next compared the simulated water orientational order with the experimental values by analyzing the O–H bond order parameter, SOH, of water molecules in the MD simulations. The principal axis of the water 1H CSA is roughly colinear with the O–H bond, thus SCSA is equivalent to SOH. The average water SOH value in the open+4/+4 state is 0.039 ± 0.005, which is slightly larger than the average water SOH value of 0.029 ± 0.004 in the closed0/+1 state (Fig. 5c). Both values are in remarkably good agreement with the experimentally measured water SCSA at high and low pH. The simulated SOH values are dominated by water near a few residues, especially L8 and H19. To better understand these results, we extended our analysis by quantifying the water orientation in terms of the angle between the vector along the O–H bond and the channel axis (Fig. 5d). The site-resolved orientational averages (Figs. 5e and 6a and Supplementary Fig. 7) show that water in the closed0/+1 channel displays little orientational preference except near L8, where there is a moderate preference for the oxygen-down orientation. In contrast, in the open+4/+4 state, water orientational order is seen at almost all positions along the channel. Notably, this open+4/+4 state orientational polarization is negative (oxygen pointing to the C-terminus) in the N-terminal half of the channel while positive (oxygen pointing to the N-terminus) in the C-terminal half of the channel (Figs. 5e and 6a and Supplementary Movie 1). This orientational switch occurs at H19. In other words, water molecules in the channel preferentially align with their oxygens pointing toward the charged H19 (Fig. 6c).Fig. 6: Water orientations in the closed0/+1 channel and the open+4/+4 channel.a Most probable water orientations along the channel axis, plotted for 4 Å bins. b, c Representative snapshots of water in the b closed0/+1 channel and the c open+4/+4 channel. Only water within 3 Å of pore-facing residues are shown.Full size imageThe closed0/+1 and open+4/+4 states differ in terms of the BM2 backbone conformation as well as the charge state of H19 and H27. To evaluate which of these factors cause the water anisotropy in the open+4/+4 state, we conducted simulations in which the protein conformation was restrained to the low-pH solid-state NMR structure while the H19 and H27 charge states were assigned as 0/+1. Conversely, we restrained the protein conformation to the closed high-pH solid-state NMR structure while enforcing the +4/+4 charge state. These simulations show that the water anisotropy was abolished in the artificial open0/+1 state despite the open protein conformation, while the orientational trend of oxygen-up C-terminal to H19 and oxygen-down N-terminal to L8 is maintained in the closed+4/+4 state, despite the closed protein conformation (Fig. 5f). Therefore, the water orientational order is primarily controlled by the charge state of H19 and H27 tetrads, not the distances between helices. 13C-detected 1H spin-lock recoupling experiments conducted at lower temperatures produced identical recoupling curves (Supplementary Fig. 8b). Since chemical exchange and rotational motion are both slowed down at lower temperature, this data confirms that it is the charge state of histidine that controls water orientation anisotropy. Between the two histidines, H27 plays no role in controlling the water orientation, since no water anisotropy is seen near H27 in either +1 or +4 charge state (Fig. 5c–f and Supplementary Fig. 7). Thus, the orientational order is induced by the spatially concentrated positive charge on the H19 tetrad.Water hydrogen bonds are less interrupted in the open channel than in the closed channelThe presence of water orientational order within the open BM2 channel suggests that the water–water hydrogen-bonding network may be directional. To assess the possible influence of this directionality on proton transport, we counted the number of water–water hydrogen bonds and evaluated their directions relative to the channel axis in the MD simulations (Fig. 7a, Methods section). We find that the open+4/+4 state permits more water–water hydrogen bonds throughout the channel than the closed0/+1 state (Fig. 7b). We classified hydrogen-bond bottlenecks as sites where connectivity along the channel was broken in an individual frame of the MD trajectory. Based on the statistics across 100 ns MD trajectories (Fig. 7c), we found two prominent bottlenecks, at L8 and H19, in the closed0/+1 state, which are barriers to Grotthus-type proton transport. Bottlenecks are significantly more prevalent in the closed0/+1 state, with at least one bottleneck in 97% of the frames, compared to only 24% of the frames in the open+4/+4 state. On average, there are 3.7 bottlenecks in the closed0/+1 state and 0.3 bottlenecks in the open+4/+4 state. In addition, the water–water hydrogen bonds switch the directions in the open+4/+4 state (Fig. 7d): the N-terminal half of the channel contains more outward hydrogen bonds, while the C-terminal half contains more inward hydrogen bonds.Fig. 7: Water–water hydrogen bonding in the closed and open BM2 channels.a Definition of the inward and outward water hydrogen bonds. b Average number of water–water hydrogen bonds along the channel axis. The open channel has more hydrogen bonds than the closed channel. c Probability of hydrogen-bond bottlenecks along the channel axis. The closed BM2 channel has high probabilities of bottlenecks at L8 and H19, while the open channel has low bottleneck probabilities throughout the channel. d Direction of water–water hydrogen bonds. The closed channel shows little preference for the hydrogen-bond polarity, while the open channel exhibits a bipolar hydrogen-bond orientation, reversed at H19. Error bars for simulations are the standard error of the mean for four independent trajectories.Full size imageDiscussionThese solid-state NMR data and MD simulations show that the water dynamics, orientation, and hydrogen-bonding in the BM2 channel differs significantly between low- and high-pH states. Low-pH channel activation gives rise to (1) a larger pore size with two-fold more water, (2) faster water reorientation and chemical exchange on the ns–μs timescales, and (3) higher water orientational order and more directional hydrogen bonds. Using 13C detection of water 1H polarization, we selectively detected the small population of water inside the BM2 channel. The fact that the low-pH channel contains more water is not surprising, since the four-helix bundle is more loosely packed at low pH due to electrostatic repulsion between the four positively charged H19 residues27,28. The excellent agreement between the measured and simulated number ratio of water molecules in the closed and open channels validates both the NMR and simulation methods. Further, the larger amount of water is not an artefact of the low temperature (277 K) at which the experiments were conducted, as shown by control simulations at 297 K (Supplementary Fig. 10).Interestingly, the number of water molecules in AM2 channels determined by X-ray crystallography was found to be sensitive to the experimental conditions. Initial cryogenic and room-temperature synchrotron crystal structures of AM2 found comparable or more water in the high-pH channel than in the low-pH channel11. The number of waters was much higher in the cryogenic structures than the room-temperature structures. These results were subsequently attributed to water ordering at low temperature and radiation damage at room temperature. When crystal structures were obtained at room temperature using an X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL), more water was found in the low-pH AM2 channel than the high-pH channel10. Solid-state NMR measurements at moderate temperatures represent a non-perturbing approach for quantifying the amount of water in membrane-bound channels. Interestingly, the XFEL data of AM2 also indicate a doubling of water amount at low pH compared high pH, in good agreement with the current BM2 results. This similarity of acid-activated water increase of AM2 and BM2 channels implies that the conserved histidine dictates the water amount in the pore (vide infra).At high pH, simulated water densities indicate low water occupancy at L8 and H19 (Fig. 2d) and frequent bottlenecks in the water hydrogen-bonding network (Fig. 7c). This hydrogen-bond disruption is not observed in AM2, which contains unbroken chains of water–water hydrogen bonds from the N-terminus to the histidine tetrad at both high and low pH11. We attribute this difference to the different oligomeric structures of AM2 and BM2: AM2 adopts a more open N-terminal vestibule at high pH that is closed after acid activation24,57. The interconversion between the two conformations underlies the functional asymmetry of the AM2 transporter, where protons are exclusively conducted inward. In comparison, the BM2 tetramer structure undergoes a symmetric scissor-like motion with respect to the center of the TM domain27. This conformational symmetry has been proposed to explain the ability of BM2 to conduct weak outward proton current in addition to strong inward current. The lower water amount at L8 in the closed0/+1 BM2 channel is thus correlated with a more compact N-terminal pore. The minimum diagonal heavy-atom distance at L8 is 11 Å for the open+4/+4 channel and 5.5 Å for the closed0/+1 channel (Supplementary Fig. 1b). BM2’s H19 pKa’s have been measured and found to be significantly lower than the H37 pKa of AM229: the average pKa of H19 is 5.1, while the average pKa of H37 in AM2 is 5.9. Although the peripheral histidine, H27, speeds up proton release from H19, even an H27A mutant of BM2 still manifests a low average H19 pKa of 5.628. The current finding of a hydrogen-bond bottleneck at L8 provides a second mechanism of this depressed H19 pKa’s, as the interruption of the water wire at L8 will slowdown proton relay from the N-terminus to H19.Both NMR relaxation and MD simulations indicate that water in the low-pH channel reorients more rapidly than water in the high-pH channel (Fig. 4, Supplementary Tables 1 and 2, and Supplementary Movie 1). Despite this faster dynamics, water in the low-pH channel has higher anisotropy than water in the high-pH channel (Fig. 5), as shown by larger motionally averaged 1H CSA. Order parameters computed from simulations are in very good agreeement with the experimental data (Fig. 5c). The unexpected finding of faster water dynamics and higher water anisotropy can be rationalized by the fact that water molecules that reorient quickly break and form hydrogen bonds with adjacent water molecules to permit proton exchange and thus Grotthuss hopping5. The higher water anisotropy at low pH is also fully consistent with the increased number and directionality of water–water hydrogen bonds at low pH (Fig. 7). This hydrogen bonding extends in opposite directions on either side of H19, with the C-terminal water favoring the inward hydrogen bonds and N-terminal water favoring outward hydrogen bonds. We attribute this hydrogen-bond polarity switch to the concentrated positive charge on the H19 tetrad.The pH-dependent dynamics and orientations of BM2 channel water are surprisingly similar to the water properties in AM2 channels, despite the low sequence homology and the distinct oligomeric structures of the two proteins. AM2 also contains more dynamic water at low pH than at high pH, as manifested by picosecond time-dependent lineshapes in 2D IR spectra58, longer water T2′ relaxation times25, and a larger number of half-occupancy water molecules in crystal structures10. MD simulations of AM2 also indicated that the water hydrogen-bond direction switches above and below H3711,13. The fact that both channels exhibit faster water dynamics and a switch in hydrogen-bond direction at the proton-selective histidine at low pH suggests that the proton-selective histidine, without assistance from other pore-lining residues, controls the water amount, water anisotropy, and water wire directionality in both AM2 and BM2 channels. The ps–ns water reorientation and the μs histidine ring reorientation serve to complete the hydrogen-bonded chain to enable proton transfer.The fact that the tetrameric conformation of M2 plays a lesser role in channel-water properties than the selectivity-filter residue is also supported by MD simulations that used a coiled-coil structure of BM2 solved in detergent micelles59,60. Despite the significant structural differences from the bilayer-bound structure27, the simulations reached the same conclusion about increased pore size and pore hydration at low pH. The charge-flipped MD simulations shown here lend further support to the essential role of the H19 charge state for regulating the water-wire properties. When the H19 tetrad is neutral, even if the four-helix bundle is loosened, the number of water molecules and the water orientational order are low. Conversely, when the H19 tetrad is highly charged, even if the four-helix bundle is tightened, the water amount and orientational order increase significantly (Fig. 5f and Supplementary Fig. 9). Therefore, the polarity of the hydrogen-bond network is electrostatically controlled by the charge state of the histidine. For AM2, the protein conformation and dynamics play the roles of limiting the net proton flux and dictating the directionality of the proton flux24,25. Whether proton flux in BM2 is rate-limited by protein conformational dynamics has not been shown, but the similar rates of proton conduction and conserved HxxxW motif suggest that this may also be the case for BM2. The millisecond motion of the four-helix bundle accounts for the ~1000 s−1 proton flux of the M2 channels, while the symmetry of the helical motion affects the extent of the reverse proton current.The combined measurements of water amount by polarization transfer NMR, water motional rates by relaxation NMR, and water orientation by recoupling NMR, represent a powerful approach for elucidating water properties in membrane proteins. MD simulations complement these NMR experimental results by providing site-specific information about water dynamics and hydrogen bonding. Our results show that proton conduction in the open state of BM2 is correlated with fast water rotational and translational diffusion, which optimizes the orientation of a hydrogen-bonded water wire61,62. The selectivity-filter histidine electrostatically controls water orientation and dynamics, and switches the water hydrogen-bond directions above and below itself. The coexistence of dynamic disorder and orientational order of water may be a general property of channels and pumps that contain more than a single file of water molecules.MethodsBM2 protein purification and membrane sample preparationUniformly 13C and 15N labeled BM2 (residues 1–51) was produced as described previously27. The protein sequence corresponds to the influenza B/Maryland/ 1/2001 strain (MFEPFQILSI CSFILSALHF MAWTIGHLNQ IKRGVNMKIR IKGPNKETINR). This construct contains the TM domain and a portion of the cytoplasmic domain of full-length BM263. BM2 (1–51) was expressed as a SUMO-tagged fusion protein in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells and purified using nickel affinity chromatography. The tag was then cleaved using SUMO protease, and the native BM2 was purified using preparative reverse phase HPLC.Two BM2 samples bound to 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (POPE) membranes at pH 7.5 and pH 4.5 were used for study. Nearly identical 13C and 15N chemical shifts were observed for BM2 transmembrane residues in POPE, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine: 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1′-rac-glycerol) (POPC:POPG) and 1,2-dilauroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DLPE) membranes27. Since the bulk of the structure determination of BM2 in lipid bilayers was done with POPE lipid membranes, the two samples studied herein relied on this membrane. The protein:lipid molar ratio was 1:16, the protein mass was 8–9 mg for each sample, obtained from 3 L expression. The protein was reconstituted into the POPE membrane by organic solvent mixing as described before.27 A Tris buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 2 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 0.2 mM NaN3, and 2 mM TCEP) was used for the pH 7.5 sample while a citrate buffer (20 mM sodium citrate, 2 mM EDTA, 0.2 mM NaN3, and 2 mM TCEP) was used for the pH 4.5 sample. The proteoliposomes were ultracentrifuged, dried to ~40 wt% water, then spun into 3.2 mm MAS rotors for solid-state NMR experiments.Solid-state NMR experimentsSolid-state NMR experiments were conducted on a Bruker Avance II 800 MHz (18.8 T) spectrometer equipped with a triple-resonance 1H/13C/15N Efree 3.2 mm magic-angle-spinning (MAS) probe. All experiments were carried out under 14 kHz MAS at a thermocouple-reported temperature of 263 K. The sample temperature was moderately higher due to frictional heating, and was estimated to be 273 K based on the water 1H chemical shift64. Two-pulse phase modulation (TPPM) 1H decoupling65 was applied at an rf field of 71 kHz during 13C acquisition. 13C chemical shifts were referenced externally to the adamantane CH2 chemical shift at 38.48 ppm on the tetramethylsilane scale and 1H chemical shifts were referenced to the Hγ peak of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) at 3.26 ppm on the tetramethylsilane scale66.13C-detected 1H T2′ experiments (Supplementary Fig. 2a) started with the selection of water 1H magnetization using a 1.5-ms Gaussian 90° excitation pulse, followed a variable echo period τecho containing a 7-μs 180° pulse in the middle. This τecho period was synchronized with the rotor period (τr) and ranged from 0.14 ms to 7.14 ms. For 1H-detected T2′ measurements, τecho ranged from 0 to 714.3 ms. The water 1H magnetization was transferred to protein with a spin diffusion mixing time τSD of 4 ms, followed by a CP contact time of 500 μs for 13C detection. To ensure that all 1H polarization detected originates from water, control experiments were conducted with a 0.1 ms τmix. No appreciable signal was observed with this mixing time (Supplementary Fig. 2a), indicating that all peptide signals, including the Hα signal that can overlap with water, were suppressed. 1H spin diffusion buildup experiments used the same pulse sequence as the 13C-detected 1H T2′ experiments, with the echo delay fixed at 0.28 ms.13C-detected water 1H R1ρ experiments (Supplementary Fig. 2b) started with water magnetization selection using a 1.5-ms Gaussian 90° excitation pulse. This was followed by a 1H spin-lock pulse for a variable delay τSL with field strengths (ω1/2π) of 3 kHz to 71 kHz. A total of 16 rf field strengths were used, and τSL values ranged from 1 ms to 15 ms for each field strength. The water 1H magnetization was transferred to protein with a τmix of 4 ms, followed by a CP contact time of 500 μs. To ensure that all 1H polarization originates from water, control experiments were run with a 10-μs τmix and 1 ms spin-lock period. No appreciable signal was observed under these conditions, indicating that all peptide signals were suppressed and all 1H polarization originates from water.For spin-lock recoupling experiments (Supplementary Fig. 2c)51, the ω1/2π values were 7 kHz, 14 kHz, and 28 kHz, corresponding to matching conditions of ω1 = 0.5 ωr, ωr, and 2ωr, and the τSL values ranged from 0.05 ms to 10 ms. The spin-lock field strength was optimized to achieve the best dephasing (lowest intensity) at a mixing time of 1 ms, which corresponds to the observed minimum for the ωr condition and the initial fast decay for the 2ωr condition (Supplementary Fig. 7). For the 13C-detected RECRR experiments (Supplementary Fig. 2d), the entire spin-lock period was separated into two phase-inverted portions, each containing a 180° pulse in the middle. The total τSL = 4nτr, where nτr is the duration of each sub-block. We used τSL values of 0.28–10.86 ms. The water 1H magnetization was transferred to protein with a mixing time τmix of 4 ms, followed by a CP contact time of 500 μs. These RECRR experiments were conducted only at spin-lock field strengths of 7 kHz, 14 kHz, and 28 kHz, using the same optimized field strengths as for the spin-lock recoupling experiments.T2 ′ and T1ρ relaxation analysisAll spectra were processed in TopSpin (Bruker Biospin). NMR data analysis and fitting were conducted using MATLAB and OriginPro. 1H- and 13C-detected T2′ relaxation curves were fit to a biexponential function of the form:$$I\left( \tau \right) = p_1e^{ - \tau /{T_{2}}^{\prime} _{,1}} + p_2e^{ - \tau /{T_{2}}^{\prime} _{,2}}$$ (1) The two time constants and associated populations are reported in Supplementary Table 1. All error bars reflect a 68% confidence interval.The rotational correlation time τrot is obtained from the water 1H T2′ values using the Bloembergen−Purcell−Pound (BPP) theory38 as follows:$$\frac{1}{{T_2}} = \frac{{3\mu _0^2\gamma ^4\hbar ^2}}{{320\pi ^2r^6}}\left( {3\tau _c + \frac{{5\tau _{{\mathrm{rot}}}}}{{1 + \omega _0^2\tau _{{\mathrm{rot}}}^2}} + \frac{{2\tau _{{\mathrm{rot}}}}}{{1 + 4\omega _0^2\tau _{{\mathrm{rot}}}^2}}} \right)$$ (2) Here \(\mu _0\)is the magnetic permeability of free space,\(\gamma\)is the 1H gyromagnetic ratio, \(\hbar\)is the reduced Planck’s constant, r is the intramolecular 1H–1H distance of water (1.58 Å), τrot is the rotational correlation time, and \(\omega _0\)is the proton Larmor frequency which is 2π × 800 × 106 rad/s in a magnetic field of 18.8 T.13C-detected water 1H R1ρ decays were fit to variable-amplitude single exponential functions. The R1ρ rates at ω1 values away from the three recoupling conditions (ω1 = 0.5ωr, ωr, and 2ωr) were used for the relaxation dispersion analysis. These R1ρ values were fit to Eq. (3), which assumes a two-state exchange model40,42:$$R_{1\rho } = R_{1\rho }^0 + \frac{{\phi _{{\mathrm{ex}}}\left( {1/\tau _{{\mathrm{ex}}}} \right)^2}}{{\omega _1^2 + \left( {1/\tau _{{\mathrm{ex}}}} \right)^2}}$$ (3) Here \(R_{1\rho }^0\) is the rotating-frame spin-lattice relaxation rate in the limit of infinitely strong ω1. The exchange parameter \(\phi _{{\mathrm{ex}}} = p_1p_2\Delta \omega ^2\) depends on the populations of the two states, p1 and p2, and on the isotropic chemical shift difference \({{\Delta }}\omega\) between the two states. \(\tau _{{\mathrm{ex}}}\) is the exchange time constant and \(\omega _1\) is the rf spin-lock field strength. Fitting the \(R_{1\rho }\) dispersion profile to Eq. (3) requires that the relaxation dispersion is solely due to fast exchange between two different isotropic chemical shifts.Numerical simulations of spin-lock recoupling to extract 1H chemical shift anisotropyThe 13C-detected water 1H R1ρ rates at the three recoupling conditions cannot be fit to an exponential function because they exhibit an additional fast oscillating component due to coherent contributions. We simulated these curves using the SpinEvolution software67. The simulations utilized an eight-spin system consisting of the protons in four hydrogen-bonded water molecules (Supplementary Fig. 6a)68. Numerical simulations were run using the NMR experimental conditions, including a static magnetic field of 18.8T (800 MHz), an MAS frequency of 14 kHz, and a 1H carrier frequency set to be on-resonance with the water protons. These simulations began with 1H magnetization along the x-axis, and the amount of magnetization was monitored with increasing spin-lock times (Supplementary Fig. 6b). Motionally averaged dipolar order parameters SHH between the two water protons were varied by setting the dipolar couplings to be 5% of the rigid-limit coupling. Motionally averaged 1H CSA was varied and compared with the rigid-limit water 1H CSA of 28.5 ppm53. The results of the simulations were found to be insensitive to the 1H CSA tensor orientation, thus we set α = β = γ = 0°. We note that when 1H CSA is included but 1H–1H dipolar couplings are turned off, the eight-spin simulation reverts to a single-spin situation.The water 1H spin-lock recoupling data exhibit oscillations that are significantly dampened compared to what is expected for a single CSA magnitude subjected to homogeneous B1 irradiation (Supplementary Fig. 6c). This dampening is likely due to a combination of incoherent R1ρ relaxation, B1 field inhomogeneity, and a distribution of 1H CSAs. We are unable to differentiate the effects of B1 field inhomogeneities from the effects of CSA distribution. Thus, we assume that there is a single dominant motionally averaged CSA. To fit the measured spin-lock recoupling profile, the B1 inhomogeneity for a 1H loop-gap resonator69 was modeled as such: CSA experiments were simulated for rf spin-lock field strengths corresponding to 90–100% in 0.2% increments of the recoupling conditions 0.5ωr, ωr, and 2ωr. We note that an rf field inhomogeneity of 110-100% results in approximately the same dephasing curve as an rf inhomogeneity of 90–100%, e.g., dephasing is roughly symmetric about the matching condition. These were then multiplied by a polynomial weighting function, \(( {\Delta \omega _1/\Delta \omega _{1,\max }} )^4\) to account for the fact that the majority of the sample experiences the desired spin-lock field strength, while the contribution from spin-lock fields that are 10% different from the desired value is relatively small (Supplementary Fig. 6d). The weighted coherent decay curves were summed and normalized to one, before being multiplied with an exponential decay function with a time constant of 5 ms to account for the incoherent R1ρ relaxation components. The RMSD between the measured and simulated spin-lock recoupling curves was calculated to find the best-fit motionally averaged CSA for each recoupling curve (Supplementary Fig. 6e).System setup and molecular dynamics simulation protocolsInitial systems for the MD simulations were set up using CHARMM-GUI70 using the following steps. First, pore waters were added to the lowest-energy NMR structures (residues 1-33) of the closed (6PVR) and open (6PVT) BM2 channels27, using the DOWSER package71, which omitted a drain step to prevent the dehydration of the cavity. The C-terminal residue R33 was capped with a methyl group and hydrogens were added using CHARMM-GUI70. The charge states of H19/H27 were assigned as 0/+1 for the high-pH helix bundle and +4/+4 for the low-pH helix bundle. Next, the prepared BM2 structures, including the pore water molecules, were inserted into an 80 Å × 80 Å POPE bilayer containing 190 lipids, orienting the channel-axis perpendicular to the membrane plane. The bilayer was solvated by a 30-Å-thick water layer on each side of the bilayer with 150 mM NaCl. The boundaries of the simulation systems were handled using periodic-boundary conditions. The system was energy-minimized using 5000 steps of steepest descent and equilibrated at 297 K and 1 atm. The equilibration protocol consisted of a series of short simulations (375 ps in total) with harmonic position restraints on the protein backbone (BB), protein sidechains (SC), lipid headgroups (LH), and lipid tails (LT; harmonic restraints as specified in Supplementary Table 3). The equilibrated structures were next subjected to four independent production runs of 130 ns in an NPT ensemble, with semi-isotropic pressure coupling at 1 atm, using a Parrinello-Rahman barostat72,73 and 277 K, using the V-rescale thermostat74. This temperature was chosen to mimic the experimental temperature of ~273 K. All water analysis was performed on the last 100 ns of MD trajectories, leaving out the first 30 ns of unconstrained NPT simulation as equilibration. All simulations were carried out using GROMACS 2018.375 and the CHARM36 forcefield, using the TIP3P water model. Short ranged non-bonded interactions employ a 1.2-nm cut-off, long-range electrostatics were calculated using the smooth particle mesh Ewald (PME) method. The LINCS algorithm76 was used to constrain h-bonds and to enable stable integration using a 2 fs timestep, simulation snapshots were saved every 10 ps for analysis.Although the TIP3P water model has been used for peptide and small protein simulations below room temperature77,78, we note that there are known limitations on the accuracy of TIP3P at 277 K79. Therefore, we performed control simulations at 297 K to reproduce the analysis (Supplementary Fig. 10). The simulations at 297 K yield qualitivally comparable results to those at 277 K. Importantly, we still find increased water density (Supplementary Fig. 10a, b), water dynamics (Supplementary Fig. 10c, d), water order (Supplementary Fig. 10e–g), and hydrogen bonding (Supplementary Fig. 10h–j) in BM2 at pH 4.5 compared to BM2 at pH 7.5.While most water analysis was conducted on unrestrained simulations, additional simulations were carried out where the protein structure was restrained to the solid-state NMR backbone structure using harmonic restraints (50 kJ mol−1 nm−2 force constant). Specifically, control simulations were performed in which the open BM2 (+4/+4 H19/H27 charge state) was kept near its NMR structure (PDB: 6PVT) and the closed BM2 (0/+1 H19/H27 charge state) was kept near its NMR structure (PDB: 6PVR). These restrained simulations had dilated channels compared to the unrestrained simulations (Supplementary Fig. 1b), thus giving a larger number of channel-water molecules and slightly increased translational and rotational dynamics. However, the ratio of water molecules between the +4/+4 and +0/+1 H19/H27 charge states, the increased water mobility for the +4/+4 charge state, and the orientation anisotropy for the +4/+4 charge state, were preserved (Supplementary Fig. 4a). Additional restrained simulations that investigate the effect of the H19/H27 charge state on water-orientation, in the absence of large-scale conformational changes in BM2, (Fig. 5f and Supplementary Fig. 9) restrain the open BM2 to its NMR structure (PDB: 6PVT) while using the closed BM2 charge state (0/+1 H19/H27), and restrain the closed BM2 to its NMR structure (PDB: 6PVR) while using the open BM2 charge state (+4/+4 H19/H27).Analysis of the MD channel-water trajectoriesThe water correlation times, orientation, and hydrogen bonding in the last 100 ns of each simulation were analyzed using the MDAnalysis package80. The scripts for calculating these quantities from the MD trajectories are available via github (https://github.com/mjmn/BM2-MD). Reported values and error bars represent the mean and standard error of the mean, over the independent trajectories included in calculating the reported quantity.Channel-axis coordinate, Z The channel-axis coordinate, Z, is defined as the projection onto a vector along the principal axis of the Cα atoms in the BM2 channel, with the vector origin set to the center of the four A17 Cα atoms, and the positive direction oriented towards the C-terminus of BM2 (channel-axis vector). To assign Z values to residues, we use the average Z value of all heavy atoms in the corresponding residue over the combined trajectories (Supplementary Table 4).Water densityWater density is reported as the average number of water molecules within a 4-Å bin along the Z axis. Water molecules are assigned based on the position of their oxygen atom. Only water molecules that are within 15 Å of the channel-axis vector are included. Restraining the protein backbone to the solid-state NMR structure resulted in slightly more water within both the open and closed channels, but the ratio between the amount of water in each channel remained the same (Supplementary Fig. 4a). This is due to the fact that the equilibriated structures are somewhat constricted compared to the solid-state NMR structures (Supplementary Fig. 1b).Water rotational dynamicsRotational auto-correlation functions are calculated as$$C_\mu (\tau ) = \frac{1}{2}\langle 3\left[ {{\mathbf{\mu }}(t) \cdot {\mathbf{\mu }}(t + \tau )} \right]^2 - 1\rangle _t$$ (4) where μ(t) is the orientation of the water-molecule dipole vector at time t. Fitting the long-time decay (>10 ps) of the auto-correlation function to an exponential function gives the rotational correlation time τrot:$$C_\mu \left( \tau \right) \propto e^{ - \tau /\tau _{{\mathrm{rot}}}}$$ (5) The τrot value was determined as a function of the displacement along the channel axis by assigning each water molecule to the channel-axis coordinate bin (4 Å width) at which its oxygen atom resides at τ = 0.Water translational dynamicsThe translational dynamics of water is quantified by fitting the mean-square displacement, MSD,$${\mathrm{MSD}}(\tau ) = \left\langle {\left| {{\mathbf{r}}(t + \tau ) - {\mathbf{r}}(t)} \right|^2} \right\rangle _t$$ (6) to the following function:$${\mathrm{MSD}}(t) = 6Dt^\alpha$$ (7) where r(t) is the position of a water oxygen at time t, and α, and D are parameters that define the translational motion of water. In the BM2 channel, the water dynamics were found to be sub-diffusive (i.e., α < 1). This quantity was determined as a function of the displacement along the channel axis.The flux of water molecules across the channel was calculated from both the N-terminus and the C-terminus by counting the number of water molecules that enter the channel on one side and exit on the other side. A water molecule contributes to the flux at the time it exits the channel. For a given water molecule, it is labeled as: entering the channel on the N-terminal side when it crosses the two-dimensional plane defined by Z = −20 Å in the positive Z direction, exiting the channel on the N-terminal side when it crosses the Z = −20 plane in the negative Z direction, entering the channel on the C-terminal side when it crosses the two-dimensional plane defined by Z = 20 Å in the negative Z direction, and exiting the channel on the C-terminal side when it crosses the Z = 20 Å plane in the positive Z direction. No significant difference in D(Z) was found between the closed and open channel. The slowdown in translational dynamics in the closed channel, summarized here using only the coefficient, is also apparent from MSD versus time plots (Supplementary Fig. 4b) and in the total number of transported water molecules through the channel: this number is 2.73 ± 0.41 moleculess in the open channel and 0.08 ± 0.05 moleculess in the closed channel (Fig. 3g).Water orientationThe water orientational order in the channel was determined by analyzing the probability distribution of the dot product between the water OH-bond vector and the channel-axis vector, Z. The full probability distributions, P(cos(θOH)), are shown in Supplementary Fig. 7. Several quantities derived from these probability distributions are presented in the main text and are described here.We used the average value \(\left\langle {\cos \left( {\theta _{{\mathrm{OH}}}} \right)} \right\rangle\) to assess the orientational preference of water along the channel axis (Fig. 5e). This quantity is defined as:$$\langle \cos (\theta _{{\mathrm{OH}}})\rangle (Z) = {\int}_{ - 1}^1 {\cos } (\theta _{{\mathrm{OH}}})P(\cos (\theta _{{\mathrm{OH}}})|Z)d\cos (\theta _{{\mathrm{OH}}})$$ (8) To compare with the measured order parameters more directly, we also calculated the OH-bond vector order parameter according to:$$S_{{\mathrm{OH}}}(Z) = \frac{1}{2}{\int}_{ - 1}^1 {\left[ {3\cos ^2(\theta _{{\mathrm{OH}}}) - 1} \right]} P(\cos (\theta _{{\mathrm{OH}}})|Z)d\cos (\theta _{{\mathrm{OH}}})$$ (9) For Fig. 5e, the probability distribution of the cos(θOH), P(cos(θOH)|Z), was determined for water molecules within a 4-Å bin along the channel axis. To directly compare with the measured NMR orientations, which do not have spatial resolution along the channel axis, we also determined the probability distribution for all water molecules from −12 Å to +12 Å along the channel coordinate.We also analyzed non-uniformity in the P(cos(θOH)) distribution (Supplementary Fig. 4d) using an entropy parameter (∆Γ) defined as$$\Delta \Gamma = \mathop {\sum}\limits_{i = 0}^{N_{{\mathrm{bin}}}} {P\left( {\cos \theta _{{\mathrm{OH}}}} \right)} \ln \left[ {P\left( {\cos \theta _{{\mathrm{OH}}}} \right)} \right] + \ln \left[ {N_{{\mathrm{bin}}}} \right]$$ (10) where Nbin is the number of bins used to discretize the P(cos(θOH)) distribution, and the ln[Nbin] offset is applied such that ∆Γ = 0 for a uniform probability distribution. Unlike cos(θOH) and SOH, ∆Γ does not depend on the direction of the reference vector for calculating cos(θOH). Higher ∆Γ values correspond to higher orientational preference. Upon restraining the protein backbone to the solid-state NMR structure, nearly identical anisotropy parameters were observed as in the unrestrained simulations (Supplementary Fig. 4a).Water–water hydrogen bondingWater hydrogen bonds were analyzed with the MDAnalysis package80. Hydrogen bonds were defined based on default geometric criteria in the package (https://www.mdanalysis.org/docs/documentation_pages/analysis/hbond_analysis.html). Specifically, a water–water hydrogen bond involved a separation of 3.0 Å or less between one water molecule’s hydrogen atom and a second water molecule’s oxygen atom, and an angle of 120° or more between the oxygen bound to the hydrogen-bonded hydrogen atom, the hydrogen-bonded hydrogen atom, and the acceptor oxygen atom.A frame stride of 10 was used. The network analysis is carried out for each frame by assigning relevant water molecules in that frame to channel axis slices and then identifying hydrogen bonds across channel-axis slices in that frame. For each frame, each water molecule’s channel-axis coordinate for that frame is determined by projecting the water molecule’s oxygen atom onto the channel axis. If the water molecule is within the channel-axis coordinate limits of −20–22 Å, and is within 15 Å of the channel-axis vector, it is included in the analysis for that frame. Water molecules are binned in 2-Å-thick bins along the channel axis.We counted the water–water hydrogen bonds in the simulated trajectories between water molecules assigned to bins separated by 2 Å, in which one water molecule is one slice (Z = n) and the second water molecule is in the adjacent slice closer to the C-terminus (Z = n + 2; Fig. 7a). For each bin, all hydrogen bonds associated with that bin are those between water molecules in that channel-axis coordinate bin (Z = n) and those in the bin 2 Å closer to the C-terminus (Z = n + 2). A water–water hydrogen bond is defined as inward, or a donor, when an N-terminal water molecule points its hydrogen atom towards a C-terminal water oxygen atom. A water–water hydrogen bond is defined as outward, or an acceptor, when an N-terminal water oxygen atom receives a hydrogen bond from a C-terminal water hydrogen atom (a C-terminal water molecule points its hydrogen atom towards an N-terminal water oxygen atom, as shown in Fig. 7a). For instance, the hydrogen-bond count associated with the channel-axis coordinate 4.0 Å bin represents the count of hydrogen bonds between the water molecules in the 4.0-Å bin and those in the 6.0-Å bin. The number of outward (acceptor) hydrogen bonds associated with the 4.0-Å coordinate represents the count of hydrogen bonds between water molecules in the 4.0-Å bin and those in the 6.0-Å bin in which the water molecule in the 4.0-Å bin is the acceptor and the water molecule in the 6.0-Å bin is the donor. An inter-slice outward-inward (or acceptor-donor) difference is computed as the difference for each frame for each slice between the inter-slice hydrogen-bond count in which the water molecules in the slice act as acceptors (in water–water hydrogen bonds with the adjacent slice 2 Å closer to the C-terminus) and the inter-slice hydrogen-bond count in which the water molecules in the slice act as donors (in water–water hydrogen bonds with the adjacent slice 2 Å closer to the C-terminus). Bottlenecks are considered to be present in a frame for a slice when there are zero hydrogen bonds between the water molecules in that slice and water molecules in the slice 2.0 Å further toward the C-terminus. For each frame, the total count of inter-slice bottlenecks along the entire channel axis is recorded. Uncertainty is quantified as the standard error of the mean using the averages for the four replicates (as described above) using scipy.stats.sem81.Statistics and reproducibilitySufficient number of scans were used for all NMR experiments to obtain good signal-to-noise. All error bars for NMR analyzed parameters reflect a 68% confidence interval. For MD simulations, the reported values and error bars represent the mean and standard error of the mean, over the four independent trajectories included in calculating the reported quantity.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.

So why did memorials for one event overshadow the other?By: Elizabeth YukoPublished: March 11, 2021copy page linkPrint PageRick Berkowitz/Getty ImagesWorld War I came to an end on November 11, 1918—nine months after the first cases of what was referred to as the “Spanish Flu” were reported in the United States. Against the backdrop of the war, the 1918 influenza pandemic surged at a time when people were already experiencing scarcity in everyday supplies, coping with having loved ones serving overseas, and living in a wartime economy. A second global crisis had started before the first one ended. The Spanish Flu Was Deadlier Than WWIWorld War I was devastating, leading to around 20 million deaths worldwide. Deaths from the 1918 pandemic were even more staggering: At least 50 million people, including 675,000 Americans, died from the disease. But the legacy of World War I overshadowed the pandemic, making the unprecedented loss of life from the flu almost an afterthought. “When the flu impact resolved, people engaged in a kind of collective amnesia,” says Monica Schoch-Spana, Ph.D., a medical anthropologist specializing in public health emergency preparedness at the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health. “At the same time though, there still was the collective trauma of the war. And so you had processes of post-war rituals and remembrances and monuments.” Investment in World War I MemorialsRaymond Boyd/Getty ImagesE. M. Viquesney's 'Spirit of the Doughboy' statue, a tribute to World War I soldiers, outside the Chicago Bears football field, 2014.For an event to become entrenched in the collective memory, it requires the public to be actively engaged in remembering it, according to Maria Luisa Lima and José Manuel Sobral in Societies Under Threat: A Pluri-Disciplinary Approach. This happens through referencing the event among family members and in everyday conversations, as well as commemorating it in monuments, rituals, archives and narratives. “The contrast between the investment in the memorialization of the war and what happened with the Spanish flu is huge,” say Lima and Sobral. They point out that, unlike wars, pandemics don’t offer the same “monumental benchmarks” that lend themselves to a monument or public commemoration, like a particular battle or the signing of a treaty. Commemorations to mark World War I emerged quickly in the wake of the war—and in a variety of forms. School textbook narratives were updated, Veterans Day was established, and monuments and memorials were placed at sites across the country. Why Were American Soldiers in WWI Called Doughboys?There are a number of theories, including ones that involve dust and clay.Read moreThe Deadliest Events in US HistoryFrom pandemics to wars to natural disasters, these events took the highest tolls on American lives.Read moreWorld War I Battles: TimelineFor four years, from 1914 to 1918, World War I raged across Europe’s western and eastern fronts after growing tensions and then the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria ignited the war. Trench warfare and the early use of tanks, submarines and airplanes meant the war’s battles were devastatingly bloody, claiming an estimated 40 […]Read moreIn the 1920s and 1930s alone, thousands of monuments and memorials—from commemorative plaques, to statues, to architectural monuments—were erected throughout the United States by state and local governments, as well as colleges, businesses, clubs, veterans groups, and houses of worship, according to the United States World War I Centennial Commission. One of the most recognizable and pervasive World War I memorials is E. M. Viquesney’s “The Spirit of the American Doughboy” sculpture. Mass-produced in three different variations, the statue was placed in parks, town squares, and other federal properties across 39 states. At least 145 of these statues remain in existence today. They all depict a World War I soldier known as a “Doughboy” holding a rifle in his left hand and a grenade in his right hand, with his right fist raised in a sign of victory. 1918 Influenza Memorials—Far Fewer and Built LaterFrederic J. Brown/AFP/Getty ImagesThe grave of Army Private Carl Axel Carlson, who died of the 1918 influenza pandemic, is seen among others who met a similar fate at a cemetery in Bisbee, Arizona. The train that carried his body home to Bisbee brought the deadly flu with it.While hundreds of World War I monuments and memorials have been lost to time, very few dedicated structures and sculptures commemorating civilian lives lost in the 1918 pandemic were built in the first place. Some of the closest equivalents are World War I memorials that include soldiers who died from influenza. The “Flu Epidemic Monument” at Camp Funston in the Fort Riley Military Reservation in Kansas features a pyramid of stacked stones honoring a unit of medical care soldiers who died in the flu epidemic. The more common iteration is World War I memorials that also include the names of soldiers who died from influenza alongside those who perished in battle, like the stone obelisk at the Camp Merritt military base in Bergen County, New Jersey.A small handful of other 1918 pandemic memorials scattered throughout the country were, for the most part, established much later—in the 2000s. Several are located in cemeteries or at the sites of mass graves containing unknown numbers of people who died from the flu, including examples in Butler County, Pennsylvania (erected in 2002); Evergreen Park outside of Chicago (2007), Springdale, Pennsylvania (2013), and Earlington, Kentucky (2019). A few other memorials went up in 2018, marking the centennial of the pandemic, including those in Camp Devens, Massachusetts and Barre, Vermont.World War I Pride vs. Medical FailureWhy such a discrepancy between World War I and pandemic memorials? One factor may be pride: World War I was seen as a show of military strength, while the 1918 pandemic was perceived as a weakness. As much as American medicine and public health had been progressing, the medical field wasn’t able to defeat the deadly influenza strain. “In an age where medicine was accumulating victories against health problems, this epidemic clearly challenged medical knowledge and questioned medical capacity to deal with the disease,” say Lima and Sobral.Having very few physical monuments commemorating the 1918 influenza pandemic contributed to its fading from public consciousness. But the 1918 pandemic was finally thrust back into the spotlight—a century later. As the world grappled with the COVID-19 pandemic, the 1918 flu offered a historical example of just how devastating a large-scale global health crisis can be.By: Elizabeth YukoElizabeth Yuko, Ph.D., is a bioethicist and journalist, as well as an adjunct professor of ethics at Fordham University.

View: Text | PDF Research Article Infectious disease Vaccines Age-specific effects of vaccine egg adaptation and immune priming on A(H3N2) antibody responses following influenza vaccination Text PDF Abstract A(H3N2) influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) was low during the 2016–19 seasons and varied by age. We analyzed neutralizing antibody responses to egg- and cell-propagated A(H3N2) vaccine and circulating viruses following vaccination in 375 individuals (aged 7 months to 82 years) across all vaccine-eligible age groups in 3 influenza seasons. Antibody responses to cell- versus egg-propagated vaccine viruses were significantly reduced due to the egg-adapted changes T160K, D225G, and L194P in the vaccine hemagglutinins. Vaccine egg adaptation had a differential impact on antibody responses across the different age groups. Immunologically naive children immunized with egg-adapted vaccines mostly mounted antibodies targeting egg-adapted epitopes, whereas those previously primed with infection produced broader responses even when vaccinated with egg-based vaccines. In the elderly, repeated boosts of vaccine egg-adapted epitopes significantly reduced antibody responses to the WT cell–grown viruses. Analysis with reverse genetic viruses suggested that the response to each egg-adapted substitution varied by age. No differences in antibody responses were observed between male and female vaccinees. Here, the combination of age-specific responses to vaccine egg-adapted substitutions, diverse host immune priming histories, and virus antigenic drift affected antibody responses following vaccination and may have led to the low and variable VE against A(H3N2) viruses across different age groups.

Look to history. History offers a number of precedents regarding the long-term social effects of the COVID-19 pandemic By Matthew Rozsa Staff Writer Published March 7, 2021 2:00PM (EST) Time lost in the COVID-19 pandemic year (Getty Images) -- Shares Facebook Twitter Reddit Email This month marks the one year anniversary of the pandemic in the United States. It may seem like so much longer, but it was only March 2020 when President Donald Trump declared a state of national emergency due to the pandemic. There is no direct parallel in American history to the sheer impact that this public health event has had on our country. It has taken more than 520,000 lives so far (roughly the same as died in World War I and World War II), exacerbated income inequality and contributed to Trump's loss in the 2020 presidential election. Americans have been compelled to work from home, significantly limit their socializing and wear masks in public. This is what many historians refer to as an inflection point: An event that changes the world, and which will be looked back upon as pivotal by future historians. And while it is impossible to say with certainty what the legacy of the COVID-19 pandemic will be for the United States, it is useful to start by looking at other major pandemics in modern American history. Although the COVID-19 pandemic is often compared to the influenza pandemic that began in 1918, that event actually did not have a particularly lasting effect on public policy or culture, according to Dr. Joshua S. Loomis, an assistant professor of biology at East Stroudsburg University and author of "Epidemics: The Impact of Germs and Their Power over Humanity." "For as many people that it killed (50-100 million), the 1918 flu had relatively few long-term impacts on public policy or culture," Loomis told Salon by email. "People generally considered the 1918 flu as a horrific extension of [World War I]. When the war and pandemic ended, most people simply wanted to move on and enjoy the economic boom of the 1920s." That said, there were some notable developments that coincided with the influenza pandemic. Loomis pointed out that it was the first epidemic to be widely publicized because it coincided with the explosive growth of the American newspaper industry. Yet that did not automatically mean that it was sufficiently reported; political and business leaders then, as today, exerted pressure to downplay the flu to avoid panic, economic blowback and distracting from winning World War I. "In this way, the 1918 flu has some strong parallels to what we have experienced with COVID-19," Loomis explained. "There has been this constant battle between protecting the population and keeping our economy afloat." The influenza pandemic also prompted changes in how Americans treat disease in general, albeit not right away. After smaller influenza epidemics in 1957 and 1968, Americans realized that they needed a better system to keep tabs on influenza virus mutants so that effective vaccines could be quickly developed and distributed. "For instance, we helped establish a worldwide network of labs that receives local data concerning new flu strains and then reports that to the [World Health Organization]," Loomis wrote. "Also, we also began producing vaccines based on those identified strains and then administering them before the arrival of flu each year. This represented a significant paradigm shift in how we approach disease prevention." While this did not occur immediately after the 1918 pandemic because the technology did not exist at the time, "it was prompted by the fear of the 1918 flu." Loomis' views were echoed by historian John M. Barry, author of "The Great Influenza: The Story of the Deadliest Pandemic in History." He wrote to Salon that the influenza pandemic, though "intense and tragic" and leaving "hundreds of thousands if not millions of orphans," did not have much of an impact on policy. "[The National Institutes of Health] was not founded until 1928, when influenza was bad enough to remind Congress what could happen, but even that took eight years." He added, "In terms of culture it's impossible to separate it from the war. Did it contribute to disillusionment, to fatalism, to a desire to let everything loose that culminated in the Roaring 20s? I think so. But especially in Europe, which lost something approaching 20 million people, half civilians, half soldiers, the war was more important." The 1918 influenza epidemic was not the only major infectious disease to sweep America within the past century. From the late 1940s until virologist Dr. Jonas Salk announced a successful vaccine in 1955, tens of thousands of people were disabled every year because of the disease. The polio epidemic was a major event because it forever changed the lives of both those who were afflicted with it and their loved ones. Both the epidemic and the announcement of Salk's vaccine significantly changed American policy and culture. Some of those changes were due to avoidable tragedies. There was the Cutter Incident, for example, an occasion in which a laboratory that had been approved to distribute Salk's vaccine accidentally mass produced some vaccines which contained a live polio virus instead of an inactivated version. (Many vaccines work by including weakened or dead versions of pathogens so that the body can learn to fight them without being endangered.) "The fiasco of the Cutter Incident shortly after the Salk vaccine was quickly approved in April 1955 demonstrated the need for the US government to take a stronger regulatory role in approving new vaccines," Dr. Daniel Wilson, professor of history emeritus at Muhlenberg College and author of "Living with Polio: The Epidemic and Its Survivors," wrote to Salon. "It may also have helped move the government to more strongly finance medical and scientific research. Remember, the polio research and trials for the Salk and Sabin vaccines were almost entirely funded by the private philanthropy [of] the March of Dimes." Wilson added that there were also significant cultural impacts to the polio epidemic. Many polio survivors became advocates for disability rights, pushing to change social attitudes toward disabled individuals and playing a major role in passing the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. In addition, the polio pandemic came at a time when Americans were already beginning to champion science as a major strength in our society. Salk's vaccine helped add to that momentum. "Culturally, the Salk vaccine especially, since it eliminated the fear of the most dreaded childhood disease, significantly increased the appreciation of what modern medicine could accomplish," Wilson explained. "It probably helped foster research into vaccines for other childhood diseases and the willingness of parents to have their children vaccinated for a wide variety of diseases. It was part of a growing cultural appreciation of what science could accomplish (atom energy, space flight, etc.) that increased in the 1950s and 1960s." Perhaps the most recent major pandemic to hit the United States was the HIV/AIDS epidemic. As Loomis explained to Salon, it probably had a bigger impact on public policy and culture than the influenza and polio pandemics combined. "First and foremost, HIV produced fundamental changes in how we view sex and sexuality," Loomis wrote to Salon. "The 10-15 years before HIV was marked by more open attitudes toward sex. The Pill could prevent pregnancy, antibiotics could cure most STDs, and the countercultural revolution of the late 1960s advocated 'free love.' When HIV was discovered in the early 1980s, it became clear that sex could kill you. As a result, people started becoming afraid of sex." This, Loomis explained, led to widespread public health campaigns that focused on safe sex or promoting abstinence. "In short, HIV effectively ended the Sexual Revolution of the 1960s and 70s," Loomis wrote to Salon. He said that the HIV/AIDS pandemic also transformed how Americans view medical privacy. Prior to the pandemic, doctors did not necessarily refrain from sharing their patients' private medical information with other people. During the pandemic, however, this caused people with HIV diagnoses to be publicly outed. Lives were ruined as employers, neighbors and others lashed out against people who were infected, destroying people's jobs, getting them kicked out of their homes and hurting them socially. In turn, many people were understandably reluctant to be tested for HIV, which made it harder for public health officials to effectively address the pandemic. "Public health officials knew that something had to be done since effective testing was absolutely necessary to get the epidemic under control," Loomis explained. "What followed was a series of new legislation designed to protect the privacy rights of patients. That all culminated with the passage of the Ryan White CARE Act in 1990 and eventually HIPAA. Everyone in the nation now enjoys medical privacy, free from fear that their private information will be shared without their consent." The HIV/AIDS pandemic also underscored the fact that Americans had spent generations not viewing infectious diseases as something that could really impact their day-to-day lives. As a result, it was more difficult for them to grapple with the implications of the epidemic. "One of the little remarked upon cultural transformations of the last century has been the rapid decline in family size, and to a large degree, that's a result of no longer fearing infectious disease," Dr. Jonathan Engel, professor of health policy and management at Baruch College and author of "The Epidemic: A History of AIDS," told Salon. As a result, Engel argued, Americans were slow to react to the seriousness of the HIV/AIDS epidemic because they were not accustomed to a disease in which the overwhelming majority of people who contracted it would eventually die as a result. "You might think, 'Oh my God, we now have an infectious disease that is 100% fatal when you get it, surely we will move heaven and earth to prevent this.' And what was so interesting about AIDS is we didn't," Engel told Salon. "As a nation, as a culture, we could no longer view infectious disease as a threat," Engel explained. "So even when a new infectious outbreak came, which was 100% fatal, we couldn't make basic changes. In fact, even the most basic things like closing down the bath houses in New York and San Francisco were met with a huge amount of civil resistance." Despite this, the AIDS pandemic had a major cultural impact, as Dr. Jon Hallberg — medical director at the University of Minnesota Physicians Mill City Clinic — wrote to Salon. "That pandemic (like this one) hit an artistic nerve," Hallberg explained. "From protest logos to the AIDS Quilt project to books (like Randy Shilts's "And the Band Played On") to plays ([Tony] Kushner's "Angels in America") to art (Robert Mapplethorpe and Keith Haring) and movies (like "Philadelphia") this disease, this crisis begged for artistic interpretations. How else can we comprehend the enormity, the horror, the pain, than through the lens of the arts?" What can we extrapolate from these pandemics in terms of how the COVID-19 pandemic will change society? "One lesson that seems obvious to me is that without a unified and consistent national message — from the world of science and medicine and from the governmental authorities on all levels — it is difficult to achieve a national consensus and consistent policy," Wilson told Salon, referring to the decentralized approach to the pandemic that marked US government policy since 2020. "That will make tackling [COVID-19] or any future epidemic much more difficult." Loomis noted that one lasting transformation could be in how Americans do business. "COVID-19 has also produced significant changes to how we do business, educate our young people, and worship in our churches," Loomis wrote. "This pandemic has proven that much of we do in person can be done virtually. I think some of that will stick in the future." At the same time, it is unlikely that Americans are going to permanently change the way they socialize, at least in the long term. "Right now we're all indulging the most nervous, anxious person in the room, the person who perceives the highest level of risk from this pandemic," Engel told Salon. "I think in about six months, that's going to end. That person will no longer [be in charge.] There's going to be people who want to maintain social distancing, who want everyone to keep wearing masks, and that person's no longer be able to make the rules." In other words, the pre-pandemic idea of "normal" will never exist again. By Matthew Rozsa Matthew Rozsa is a staff writer at Salon.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has expanded the approval of Flucelvax® Quadrivalent (inactivated influenza vaccine; Seqirus) for active immunization in patients 2 years of age and older against influenza disease caused by influenza virus subtypes A and type B contained in the vaccine. Previously, the vaccine was approved for patients 4 years of age and older. Flucelvax Quadrivalent is a subunit influenza vaccine manufactured using cell derived candidate vaccine viruses; it does not contain egg proteins or antibiotics. For patients aged 2 to 8 years, the vaccine is administered as 1 or 2 doses (0.5mL each) at least 4 weeks apart depending on vaccination history as per annual Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendations. The expanded approval was based on absolute efficacy data from a multinational, randomized study that compared the efficacy, immunogenicity and safety of Flucelvax Quadrivalent to a non-influenza comparator in 4513 patients aged 2 to 17 years over 3 influenza seasons. Efficacy was assessed by the prevention of confirmed influenza illness caused by any influenza type A or B strain. Results showed that overall vaccine efficacy for the entire study population was reported to be 54.6% (95% CI, 45.7-62.1), which met predefined success criteria. In children 2 through 8 years of age, vaccine efficacy was 50.5% (95% CI, 38.4-60.2), while in those 9 through 17 years of age, vaccine efficacy was 61.9% (95% CI, 47.4-72.3). Flucelvax Quadrivalent is expected to be available for the 2021-2022 influenza season. The product is supplied in 0.5mL single-dose prefilled syringes and 5mL multi-dose vials. References 1.

It has clearly merited an aggressive public-health response, albeit probably not the exact combination of policies that federal, state and local authorities have wielded over the past year.Since early in that response, though, I’ve wondered about the two big post-World War II influenza pandemics that used to be called the “Asian flu” and “Hong Kong flu,” and are now labeled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as the “1957-1958 Pandemic” and the “1968 Pandemic.” According to the CDC, the former killed 116,000 Americans and the latter 100,000. Adjusted for population that would amount to 221,000 and 164,000 people today — a lot less than Covid-19, but still staggeringly large numbers, especially when you consider that those deaths weren’t nearly as concentrated among those 65 and older as Covid’s have been.Before it’s here, it’s on the Bloomberg TerminalBloomberg Terminal LEARN MOREHomeBTV+Market DataOpinionAudioOriginalsMagazineEventsNewsMarketsEconomicsTechnologyPoliticsGreenCryptoAIWork & LifeWealthPursuitsBusinessweekCityLabEqualityPursuitsWork ShiftMarket DataStocksCommoditiesRates & BondsCurrenciesFuturesSectorsEconomic CalendarExploreNewslettersExplainersThe Big TakeGraphicsSubmit a TipAbout UsTerms of ServiceDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationTrademarksPrivacy PolicyCareersMade in NYCAdvertiseAd ChoicesHelp©2024 Bloomberg L.P.

Patel, MD, FAAFP, FACSM Share Print Chronic health conditions can increase your risk of being hospitalized with influenza (the flu). A study by the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that severe illness from the flu is more likely among adults who have specific chronic medical conditions compared with those who do not. This is because chronic conditions may leave your body too weak to fight the flu. The higher your risk of flu complications, the more important it is that you get an annual flu vaccine. It’s the best way to protect yourself from the flu. Even though COVID-19 has taken focus away from the flu, it is just as important as ever to protect yourself from the flu. Flu pandemics have come and gone for hundreds of years. Several strains of the flu virus circulate each year. A flu shot is your best defense. People at high risk for flu complications include those with these chronic conditions, according to the CDC: Asthma Blood disorders (such as sickle cell disease) Chronic lung disease (such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD] and cystic fibrosis) Diabetes Endocrine disorders (such as diabetes) Heart disease (such as congenital heart disease, congestive heart failure, and coronary artery disease) Kidney diseases Liver disorders Obesity (with a body mass index (BMI) of 40% or higher) History of stroke Not only can having a chronic condition put you at high risk for serious flu complications, it also can make your chronic condition worse. This is true even if your condition is well-managed. Path to improved health You should get the flu vaccine as soon as it becomes available each fall. You also can get it any time throughout the flu season (usually until March). For some populations, it’s best to get it in the fall so that the vaccine can protect you throughout the flu season (about 6 months) but most adults under 65 with no chronic conditions can get it as early as July or August. In the United States, flu activity peaks between December and February. The vaccine is available by shot or by nasal spray (LAIV4). The CDC recommends that people who have chronic conditions or people over 50 years of age get the flu shot, not the nasal spray flu vaccine. The vaccine can reduce the chance of hospitalization by 40% and the risk of admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) by 82% for people who have chronic conditions, according to the CDC. Flu vaccines work by exposing your immune system to an inactive (killed) form of the flu virus. Your body will build up antibodies to the virus to protect you from getting the flu. The nasal spray vaccine contains active but weakened viruses. You cannot get the flu from the flu shot or the nasal spray vaccine. If you are 65 years of age or older, the CDC recommends that you get either a high-dose flu shot, an adjuvanted flu, or a regular shot. The high-dose and adjuvanted shots are designed especially for this age group. Vaccine safety The flu vaccine is safe. There are very few side effects. After receiving the flu shot, your arm may be sore for a few days. You may have a low-grade fever, feel tired, or have sore muscles for a short time. If you received the nasal spray vaccine, you may have a runny nose, headache, cough, or sore throat. It is safe to get your flu shot at the same time as another vaccine on the same visit. Where can I get a flu shot? There are many places that offer flu shots. Where you decide to get a flu shot will likely depend on location and cost. Flu shots are available from your family doctor, from national pharmacies (such as CVS and Walgreens), at clinics, community health centers, urgent care centers, public health departments, colleges (free for students), some employers, and more. Cost for the flu shot ranges from free to around $50, depending on whether you have insurance (private insurance, Affordable Care Act, Medicare Part B). If you do have insurance, most of the places listed above will offer you a flu shot at no cost to you. If you do not have insurance, look for places offering discounted flu shots. Many national pharmacies offer coupons or other discounts for flu shots. Prices vary widely, so shop around. It can mean paying $19 or more than twice that. Look for online coupons, as well, or look for cost comparisons on GoodRx. Also, be prepared to pay up front before receiving the flu vaccination. If you want help sorting out where to find a flu vaccine near you, there are online tools that can help. Try looking on vaccines.gov. It uses zip codes to help you narrow the search.

Share: Reddit Share Text: SASKATOON -- There have been so few cases of influenza this year that Canadian public health officials still can’t declare the official start of flu season. “Influenza activity remains below the threshold required to declare the start of the 2020-21 influenza season,” reads the latest FluWatch report from the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC). On a national level, flu season typically starts in mid-November. “All indicators of influenza activity remain exceptionally low for this time of year, despite continued monitoring for influenza across Canada.” So far this season, there hasn’t been any evidence of community circulation of the virus, nor have any laboratory-confirmed outbreaks of influenza been reported. However, in Canada’s schools and daycares, there have been 117 outbreaks of influenza-like-illness -- a broad descriptor where the source may or may not have been the flu. The news that flu has been seemingly stopped in its tracks is likely welcomed by front-line workers who have spent the past year grappling with staying safe due to the COVID-19 pandemic. PHAC also noted that flu testing and vaccinations were at higher and comparable levels, respectively, to previous years. Approximately 32 per cent of adults 18 years old and older were vaccinated for the flu, with 70 per cent of seniors 65 years and older being vaccinated, according to the 2020-2021 Seasonal Influenza Immunization Coverage Survey. According to PHAC, the trend of low cases is likely “influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic, including changes in healthcare-seeking behaviour, impacts of public health measures and influenza testing practices.” There have been so few cases in circulation this season that the National Microbiology Laboratory hasn’t received samples of flu viruses from the 2020-2021 season to examine.

In her case, she suffered through the flu pandemic of 1890, which was also called “Russian flu.” One million deaths That flu pandemic was first detected in St. Petersburg, Russia, in 1890 and spread rapidly through Europe. Within four months it was present all over the world. It’s estimated that it affected 25 million people and caused one million deaths. The contagion ended nine years later, in 1899. Influenza sweeps through Lisieux The pandemic had its waves, and one of them took place in 1892. In that year the influenza virus spread throughout France and entered the monastery of the Discalced Carmelites of Lisieux, where a young Therese of Lisieux, then 19 years old, was living. She had entered the monastery 4 years earlier, on April 9, 1888. All the Carmelite nuns fell ill, except Therese and two other young nuns. They took on all the work of the monastery and took care of those who were in bed, attending to each of them in their own cell. Influenza soon caused the death of 4 nuns, and St. Therese had to prepare their funerals. Her testimony of fortitude and faith The saint herself left a record of all of this, and you can read it in The Story of a Soul. It’s as if she had prepared a lesson for those of us who more than a century later find ourselves in similar circumstances. Here are some paragraphs of her testimony: … Towards the close of the year 1891, an epidemic of influenza raged in the Community; I only had it slightly and was able to be about with two other Sisters. It is impossible to imagine the heartrending state of our Carmel throughout those days of sorrow. The worst sufferers were nursed by those who could hardly drag themselves about; death was all around us, and, when a Sister had breathed her last, we had to leave her instantly. My nineteenth birthday was saddened by the death of Mother Sub-Prioress; I assisted with the infirmarian during her agony, and two more deaths quickly followed. I now had to do the Sacristy work single-handed, and I wonder sometimes how I was equal to it all. … Amid all this desolation I felt the Hand of God and knew that His Heart was watching over us. Our dear Sisters left this life for a happier one without any struggle; an expression of heavenly joy shone on their faces, and they seemed only to be enjoying a pleasant sleep. During all these long and trying weeks I had the unspeakable consolation of receiving Holy Communion every day. How sweet it was! For a long time Jesus treated me as a spoiled child … In that dire situation, the community of nuns discovered what St. Thérèse of Lisieux was really made of. Until then she had been believed to be in poor health and weak in spirit, but now her faith and strength were revealed. Five years later, Therese herself would go to heaven.

We analyzed the clinical severity and epidemiologic aspects of COVID-19 in consecutive children aged 0–18 years, referred with a suspicion of COVID-19 between February 1, and April 15, 2020. RT-PCR on a nasopharyngeal swab was used to confirm COVID-19. 319 children met the criteria of a suspected case. COVID-19 was diagnosed in 15/319 (4.7%) patients (8 male; mean age 10.5 years). All of them had household contact with an infected relative. Five (33.3%) patients were asymptomatic. In 9/15 (60.0%) children, the course of the disease was mild, and in 1/15 (6.7%), it was moderate, with the following symptoms: fever (46.7%), cough (40%), diarrhea (20%), vomiting (13.3%), rhinitis (6.7%), and shortness of breath (6.7%). In the COVID-19-negative patients, other infections were confirmed, including influenza in 32/319 (10%). The clinical course of COVID-19 and influenza differed significantly based on the clinical presentation. In conclusion, the clinical course of COVID-19 in children is usually mild or asymptomatic. In children suspected of having COVID-19, other infections should not be overlooked. The main risk factor for COVID-19 in children is household contact with an infected relative.

On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 a pandemic3. In April 2020, the epicenter of the pandemic moved from China to the United States (US) and Europe.Data on SARS-CoV-2 infection in children are scarce1,2,4. Children seem to be less likely to be affected by the disease. Among over 72,000 COVID-19 cases from China, only 1.2% of the patients were children 10 to 19 years of age, and 0.9% were children under 10 years of age5. Pediatric cases of COVID-19 outside China are reported sporadically. According to the available data, the proportion of children among all infected patients ranged between 0.6 and 2.4% in China, 0.8% in Spain, 1.4% in Italy, 1.7% in the US, 2.8% in Australia, 3.6% in Singapore, and 1.0–5.2% in the Republic of Korea4,6,7. The clinical course of COVID-19 in children seems to be less severe than that in adults, with fewer clinical symptoms and case-fatality rates close to 0%1,2. In the study by Wu and McGoogan, involving over 72,000 COVID-19 cases in China, with an overall case-fatality rate of 2.3%, only one death occurred in an adolescent, and no child younger than 10 years of age died5.There is also evidence suggesting that children are as likely as adults to become infected, but they are less likely to develop severe clinical symptoms or any symptoms at all1. Several observations suggest that children may experience different clinical symptoms than adults7,8,9. In addition, asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic children may transmit the disease, posing a risk of infection to their adult and elderly relatives10.As data on COVID-19 in children are limited and studies in this field from the European region are scarce, we aimed to analyze the clinical and epidemiologic aspects of COVID-19 in children. In particular, we have focused on the role of the epidemiological and clinical features for screening SARS-CoV-2 infection and the severity of COVID-19 in pediatric patients. In addition, we aimed to compare the clinical course of COVID-19 with COVID-19-negative patients diagnosed with other illnesses, including influenza.Materials and methodsAll consecutive pediatric patients aged 0–18 years referred to our tertiary health care department between February 1, 2020, and April 15, 2020 with a suspicion of COVID-19 were included in this prospective observational study. The suspected cases presented as having clinical symptoms of the disease or a positive epidemiological history (international travel or contact with an infected person). Household contact was defined as living with a relative positively tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection, irrespective of the clinical presentation. The Regional Hospital of Infectious Diseases in Warsaw is the main center dedicated to COVID-19 patients in central Poland and sees patients of all ages. To our knowledge, about 25% of all children with COVID-19 in Poland are seen in our center. The first COVID-19 case in Poland was diagnosed on March 4, 2020, and until April 17, 2020, there were 8,379 confirmed cases, and 332 deaths were reported. Our region in central Poland is the most affected, with 1883 cases (348.5 cases per million). Data on the ages of the positively diagnosed patients are unavailable.For clinical purposes and qualifying patients for testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection, the case definition from the WHO with its amendments was used, which also formed the basis for the definition of a case suspected for COVID-19 from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC)1,11. Thus, before local transmission in Poland occurred (March 11, 2020), there were patients referred to our department who did not meet the criteria of a suspected case. These patients were not tested for COVID-19 and were excluded from the final analysis. Demographical, epidemiological, and clinical data were analyzed, and cases were grouped based on the results of COVID-19 testing. In addition, the clinical presentations of COVID-19 and influenza were compared.The clinical course of COVID-19 was defined as follows: asymptomatic, when no complaints or symptoms were present at or before the moment of diagnosis and no abnormalities were found on physical examination; mild, when symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection were present, with or without fever and other complaints (e.g., fatigue, myalgia), and without pneumonia (either on auscultation or chest X-ray); moderate, when pneumonia (confirmed by chest X-ray) but no hypoxemia was present; severe, when pneumonia (confirmed by chest X-ray) progressing to dyspnea with oxygen saturation < 92% was present; and critical, when acute respiratory distress syndrome, shock, or any organ failure occurred. Similar definitions have been used by other authors9,12.For the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on a nasopharyngeal swab was performed in a certified molecular diagnostics laboratory using a certified method (COVID-19 Genesig Real-Time PCR Assay, Primerdesign Ltd., Chandler’s Ford, UK)13. Infection was defined as at least one positive test result. To establish the diagnosis in children negative for SARS-CoV-2, further laboratory and microbiological testing was performed based on the clinical presentation. To diagnosis influenza, we used commercially available rapid influenza diagnostic tests. In case of a negative result in children suspected for influenza or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, a PCR method was used (Cepheid Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV, Maurens-Scopont, France). To confirm group A Streptococcal infection, commercially available Rapid Strep Tests were used.Statistical analysisData were assessed for normal distribution using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. Continuous variables were presented as medians with interquartile ranges (IQRs) and were compared using the Mann–Whitney test. Categorical variables were compared using either the chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test, as appropriate. A two-sided p value of < 0.05 was considered significant. All statistical analyses were performed using MedCalc Statistical Software version 19.1.1 (MedCalc, Ostend, Belgium, https://www.medcalc.org).Ethical statementThe investigation was performed in accordance with the ethical standards in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments. The local Ethics committee by the Regional Medical Chamber in Warsaw approved this study and the treatment protocol for pediatric patients with COVID-19. Written informed consent was collected from all the patients and/or their parents/guardians before their inclusion in the study.ResultsStudy populationDuring the period analyzed, 423 patients were referred to our department with suspicion of COVID-19. Of them, 104 did not meet the current WHO definition of a case suspected for COVID-19 (before the local transmission occurred in Poland). They were not qualified for testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection and were excluded from the study. Thus, 319 patients, aged 14 days to 18 years, were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection with the PCR method and were included in the final analysis. Almost a quarter of the patients had a history of international travel in the 14 days before admission (most commonly to Italy), and 13.5% had household contact with a relative with documented COVID-19. The demographic and epidemiological characteristics of the study group are presented in Table 1.Table 1 Demographic, epidemiological, and clinical characteristics of the study group.Full size tableCOVID-19 was confirmed in 15/319 (4.7%) of cases. Other diagnoses included bacterial pharyngitis, influenza, pneumonia, otitis media, RSV, bronchitis, and bacterial infections (e.g., urinary tract infection, gastrointestinal infections, bacteremia) (Fig. 1).Figure 1Final diagnoses in the study group (data available for 172 patients).Full size imageClinical characteristics of COVID-19 in childrenAmong SARS-CoV-2-infected children, there were 8 boys and 7 girls, with a mean age of 10.5 years (Table 1). One patient had an underlying disease (asthma). All of the children diagnosed with COVID-19 had close, household contact with an infected family member. Among our patients, there were two pairs of siblings. Only one child had a history of international travel within the 14 days before the onset of the disease; however, all our cases were diagnosed after local transmission in Poland had occurred (March 11, 2020).Five patients (33.3%) were asymptomatic and were tested for SARS-CoV-2 only because of household contact with an infected relative. In the remaining 10/15 (66.7%) cases, the course of the disease was symptomatic but mild-to-moderate (Fig. 2). The most commonly observed symptoms included fever, dry cough, diarrhea, vomiting, rhinitis, and shortness of breath (Table 1). However, the most frequently observed symptom—fever—occurred in only 46.7% of patients. Eleven children required hospitalization; however, in 7 cases, only a short 1-day hospitalization was necessary to perform clinical evaluation, laboratory testing, and chest X-ray, which was performed in 10 patients. In one case, radiological features of interstitial pneumonia were observed, and the clinical course of the disease was moderate. This patient received combined treatment with azithromycin and chloroquine. In one child, coinfection with influenza was diagnosed, and the patient received oseltamivir. In total, 7 symptomatic patients were treated with azithromycin according to local recommendations that indicate the immunomodulatory influence of this substance. In two patients, bacterial superinfection was diagnosed. These patients received beta-lactam antibiotics. Severe complications of the disease were not observed in any of the patients. None of the patients qualified for treatment in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), and no child required oxygen therapy or mechanical ventilation. Thus, in no case was the clinical course of the disease described as severe or critical.Figure 2Clinical course of COVID-19 in the study group (n = 15). No child presented with a severe or critical course of the disease.Full size imageComparison between COVID-19-positive and COVID-19-negative patientsIn comparison with other patients from the study group, significantly more children with COVID-19 had contact with an infected family member (100% vs. 9.2%, P < 0001). An analysis of clinical presentation data showed that cough was significantly less frequent in the COVID-19-positive group (40.0% vs. 84.3%, P = 0.009). In addition, there was a trend towards less frequent fever and rhinitis (46.7% vs. 70.3%, P = 0.05; 6.7% vs. 19.4%, P = 0.06, respectively), as well as more frequent diarrhea in children with COVID-19 (20.0% vs. 6.5%, P = 0.05). Compared with COVID-19-negative patients, infected children were more commonly hospitalized (73.3% vs. 37.1%, P = 0.005); however, a higher proportion of them were asymptomatic (33.3% vs. 7.2%, P = 0.0004).Comparison between COVID-19 and influenzaInfluenza was one of the most commonly diagnosed diseases in our study group (32/319, 10%) and was more than twice as common as COVID-19 (4.7%). Comparison between COVID-19 and influenza patients revealed a more frequent history of household contact with a SARS-CoV-2-infected person among COVID-19 patients (100% vs. 3.1%, P < 0.0001). In contrast, influenza patients had significantly more frequent travel abroad (68.8% vs. 6.7%, P = 0.0001). The most popular destination was Italy (15/22, 68.2%), and the remaining patients travelled to United Kingdom (2), Germany (2), France (1), Spain (1), and Austria (1). Clinical presentation of the diseases differed significantly. First, there were no asymptomatic cases of influenza compared to 33.3% of cases with asymptomatic COVID-19 (P = 0.0006). In symptomatic patients, the frequency of fever, cough and sore throat was significantly higher in the influenza group (96.8% vs. 46.7%, P = 0.0001; 84.3% vs. 40.0%, P = 0.002; 25.0% vs. 0, P = 0.03, respectively), whereas COVID-19 patients more frequently suffered from diarrhea (20.0% vs. 0, P = 0.009). The groups did not differ in the proportion of hospitalized patients; however, antibiotic treatment was more commonly implemented in the COVID-19 group (46.7% vs. 15.6%, P = 0.02).Role of epidemiological and clinical evaluation for predicting COVID-19 diagnosisOur observations revealed that the highest risk of infection exists when the presence of clinical symptoms is accompanied by confirmed contact with an infected family member (62.5%). The risk was lowest when the epidemiological history was negative, even in the presence of the clinical symptoms (0%, Table 2).Table 2 Assessment of the risk of COVID-19 according to epidemiological data and the presence of clinical symptoms.Full size tableDiscussionCOVID-19 is a novel infection and has been known for only a few months. Thus, knowledge of the disease, especially in specific groups of patients, e.g., children, is scarce and limited. As the epidemic is ongoing, every reported observation on the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the infection is essential for our understanding of the disease. To date, a large share of the scientific evidence has originated in China. It is possible that country-specific factors (e.g., nutrition, epidemiological influences, day care) in European children may differ from the Chinese population14. To the best of our knowledge, we present one of the first reports on COVID-19 in the pediatric population outside of China.In our group of 319 patients suspected for COVID-19, 4.7% were positive. In a study performed in Madrid by Tagarro et al., 41 of 365 (11.2%) pediatric patients had positive test results during the first two weeks of the epidemic in Spain4. In early January 2020, in Wuhan, of 366 children screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection, 6 patients (1.6%) were positive15. The differences in these cohorts may result from different indications for testing, e.g., testing all suspected cases or only symptomatic patients. Since children are often asymptomatic, this may significantly influence the proportion of the positive results. The median age of our patients was 10.5 years (range 10 months–14 years). In other studies, the mean age of affected children differed. In the study from Madrid, the median age was 3 years (range 0–15 years); in the US, among all 2572 COVID cases, the median age was 11 years (range 0–17)4,7. In the largest Chinese pediatric case series by Dong et al. that reported 2143 patients with COVID-19, the mean age was 7 years, similar to the study from Wuhan on 171 patients, in which the median age was 6.7 years (1 day–15 years)8,9. No significant predominance of sex was found in any pediatric report. In the study by Dong et al., there were 56.6% boys in the study group, which is similar to our 53.3%9.Available data suggest that the main source of infection in children is household exposure, as 56.0%—90% of the diagnosed children had an infected family member1,6. This trend was even more pronounced in our study, where family clustering occurred for all infected children. In addition, among our patients, there were two pairs of siblings. Our observations revealed that the highest risk of infection exists when the presence of clinical symptoms is accompanied by confirmed contact with an infected family member (62.5%).On the basis of previously published data, COVID-19 symptoms seem to be less severe in children than in adults9,14. Approximately 10% of cases in children are asymptomatic1. In the study by Dong et al., with the largest child case series so far, over 90% of the 2143 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 had either asymptomatic or mild-to-moderate disease9. In the remaining 5.2%, the course of the disease was severe, and in 0.6%, it was critical9. In our group, 33.3% patients were asymptomatic, which may result from the fact that we tested asymptomatic children with confirmed contact with an infected relative. In the remaining patients, the course of the disease was mild-to-moderate, with no severe or critical cases. Several explanations for the milder presentation of COVID-19 in children have been suggested14,16. First, children might have a different immune response to SARS-CoV-2 than adults16. Children, especially young children, tend to have repeated exposure to many viral infections, which may benefit their immune system when it responds to SARS-CoV-214. Second, the presence of other viruses in the mucosa of the airways, which is common in children, may limit the growth of SARS-CoV-2 by direct virus-to-virus competition16. Another possibility is that the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, which is less mature in young children, protecting them against the virus14.Observations from the US on 291 pediatric and 10,944 adult patients revealed that clinical symptoms of COVID-19 are observed less frequently in children than in adults7. A previous report found that 73% of children and 93% of adult patients had symptoms of fever, cough, or shortness of breath7. According to Chinese reports on pediatric COVID-19 patients, the most common symptoms were fever, which occurred in 44–50% of children, and cough, experienced by 38% of patients, followed by rhinitis, fatigue, headache, diarrhea, and dyspnea1,17,18. This is similar to our observations that fever occurred in 46.7% and cough in 40% of the COVID-19 patients. Interestingly, both symptoms were significantly more frequent in patients negative for COVID-19 (70.3% and 71.3%, respectively). In addition, gastrointestinal symptoms were observed more commonly in the COVID-19-positive patients: 20% experienced diarrhea and 13.3% experienced vomiting. In the US cohort, these symptoms were observed in 13% and 11% of children, respectively7. In a study that included 171 children from Wuhan Children’s Hospital, diarrhea occurred in 8.8% of patients, and vomiting occurred in 6.4% of patients8. These observations suggest, that gastrointestinal symptoms are common in children infected with SARS-CoV-2 and they should trigger tests for COVID-19.Eleven children in our group (73.3%) were hospitalized. This proportion is higher compared to other cohorts, e.g., the US, where 1.6–2.5% of 123 patients required hospitalization19. However, in 7 out of 11 cases, only a short 1-day hospitalization was necessary to perform clinical evaluation, laboratory testing and chest X-ray. In one patient, radiological features of pneumonia were observed. This patient received combined treatment with azithromycin and chloroquine as part of a clinical trial. The child recovered without severe complications. No severe or critical cases requiring hospitalization in the PICU were observed in our group, similar to observations of other authors from China6,18. However, several individual cases of children requiring mechanical ventilation and PICU admission have been reported thus far4,14. With an increasing prevalence of COVID-19 during the next waves of pandemic, asymptomatic children or those with a mild course of the disease, would not require hospitalization due to the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Children presenting with more severe course of COVID-19, in particular when oxygen therapy is needed, or patients with comorbidities, should be referred to the hospital.A significant number of our patients were negative for COVID-19, and other diagnoses were established, including bacterial infections, that required proper treatment. This is an essential finding during a pandemic, when access to health services may be limited. In symptomatic children suspected of having COVID-19, other, more common infections are possible and should not be overlooked. To our knowledge, there are no published data that compare the clinical courses of COVID-19 and influenza in children. In our study, 10% of patients suspected of having COVID-19 were infected with influenza virus. This rate is similar to observations from Wuhan, where among 366 children, influenza A or B was detected in 43 (11.8%) patients15. In one patient, coinfection with COVID-19 and influenza was diagnosed. Clinical presentation of both diseases differed significantly. First, all cases of influenza were symptomatic and had a higher frequency of fever, cough, and sore throat, whereas COVID-19 patients more frequently suffered from diarrhea. There was no difference between groups in the proportion of hospitalized patients; however, antibiotic treatment was more commonly implemented in the COVID-19 group.This study was limited by a small number of children with a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. We did not include asymptomatic patients with no epidemiological history, which might have influenced the final number of infected cases. However, considering that the pandemic is ongoing, the results presented here provide valuable data for understanding the epidemiological and clinical features of COVID-19 in the pediatric population.On the basis of our experience, we conclude that the clinical course of COVID-19 in the pediatric population is usually mild or asymptomatic. In symptomatic children with suspected COVID-19 and those who have been screened for COVID-19, other infections are common and should not be overlooked. The main risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection in children is close household contact with an infected relative. Thus, children who have an infected family member should be tested for COVID-19, irrespective of their clinical presentation.

Did WHO act too late? - Saudi Gazette Monday November 11, 2024 / 09 , Jumada al-ula , 1446 Leading The Way SG Saudi Arabia Opinion Discover Saudi World Sports Business Life Advertisements World It's a year since COVID-19 was declared a pandemic. Did WHO act too late? March 11, 2021 Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus Follow Saudigazette on GENEVA — Exactly one year ago, during a cramped media briefing that would look out of place today, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that COVID-19 was a pandemic. Some say that declaration came too late, a precursor to the chaos and difficulties that would follow throughout the next year, with half of humanity under virus restrictions a mere month later. "In early January we knew that this was a pandemic and many of us were saying it publicly," said Michael Mina, an assistant professor of epidemiology at Harvard University's T.H. Chan School of Public Health. "The moment that we saw that the virus was spreading across all of East Asia, Southeast Asia and into the Middle East all within weeks of it first being discovered, we should have declared it as a pandemic virus. We didn’t; the world didn’t and that to me was the beginning of inaction as a response," he added. By the time COVID-19 was declared a pandemic last March, there were more than 118,000 confirmed cases of the virus in 114 countries and more than 4,000 deaths. Many European countries locked down the same week amid rising hospitalizations. Exactly a year later, there are more than 117 million cases and 2.6 million deaths globally, representing a 99,000 percent increase in the number of infections. But the declaration on March 11, 2020, was without fanfare, with the WHO director-general warning that they did not use the word "pandemic" lightly. “Pandemic is not a word to be used lightly or carelessly,” said Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, defending their call because cases had increased 13-fold in two weeks and the number of impacted countries had tripled. “It’s a word that if misused can cause unreasonable fear or unjustified acceptance that the fight is over, leading to unnecessary suffering and death.” Now many experts have said this is likely the worst pandemic in a century, as it has upended people's lives globally and drawn comparisons to the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic responsible for tens of millions of deaths. Some experts have decried a global complacency to address COVID-19 as a pandemic from the beginning. What is a pandemic? A pandemic is the spread of a new disease globally or the potential of a new disease to spread globally. Past pandemics have often been caused by animal influenza viruses, the WHO says. The first pandemic of the 21st century was the H1N1 influenza from 2009 to 2010. The virus is estimated to have caused between 100,000 and 400,000 deaths in the first year, according to WHO. The worst pandemic in the 20th century, meanwhile, was the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic that was estimated to have killed between 20 and 50 million people worldwide. The virus SARS-CoV-2 which causes COVID-19 is the first coronavirus to cause a pandemic. Countries unprepared after WHO declaration of a global health emergency WHO declared a pandemic over a month after declaring COVID-19 a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) on Jan. 30, 2020. At the time, there were fewer than 100 cases and no deaths outside China, according to WHO. Many experts have said that early global mishaps, including a lack of PCR tests and a lack of protective equipment for doctors, contributed to the rapid spread of the virus in several countries during the month of February. COVID-19 was the sixth epidemic to be declared a PHEIC or global health emergency under the World Health Organization's 2005 International Health Regulations. Previous PHEICs include H1N1, wild-type polio, ebola (in 2014 and 2019) and Zika virus. "The pandemic declaration isn’t part of WHO architecture — it doesn’t have a legal meaning such as a PHEIC [global health emergency]," said Clare Wenham, assistant professor of global health policy at the London School of Economics. So the pandemic declaration was likely a "use of language to try and encourage governments to take seriously the threat when the PHEIC hadn't been as effective as hoped." A PHEIC is the highest level of alarm under international law, according to WHO and was agreed upon as such by member states that this would trigger collective action. Indeed, Dr Tedros said in March as he declared a pandemic that WHO officials were alarmed by the level of government "inaction" to stop the spread of COVID-19 and continued to emphasize that it was still possible to curtail the spread of the virus through testing, tracing and isolating cases. Experts have criticised governments for their lack of preparation following the WHO declaration of COVID-19 as a global health emergency. Did the pandemic declaration come too late? Mina said he spoke to major testing companies in early 2020 and they told him they were not sure if they were massively producing COVID-19 tests. "Had the WHO back in January said this is obviously a pandemic, by definition already, that would have given the companies a couple [of] months head start to start building their testing infrastructure," he said in response to Euronews at a Harvard press conference. There's also been criticism of WHO for declaring a global health emergency late: a WHO committee met on Jan. 22 and decided not to declare a PHEIC, but then reversed that decision just a week later as the situation evolved rapidly. "The PHEIC is designed to be a normative call to arms and to get governments to wake up to the risk and start to prepare," Wenham said. "For many reasons, this didn’t happen as expected in early 2020," she said, citing governments not taking the risk seriously and the waning power of the WHO as some reasons. But she added there is currently a need for comprehensive data on whether governments take action following WHO health emergency declarations. On Monday, WHO's emergencies director Dr Mike Ryan said that "maybe we need to shout louder, but maybe some people need hearing aids". Some say the slow declaration merely foretold of the missteps that would define COVID-19 responses. "There are major consequences to not looking at the writing on the wall, taking a very fact-based approach and just saying hey this is a pandemic let’s let the world know," says Mina. "We’re seeing the remnants of that type of thinking continue today." Mina is currently doing research on rapid testing and says he does not understand why there is hedging on behalf of authorities to let people test themselves at home without a prescription. "A year into this pandemic after everything we’ve seen, we’re still really talking about whether people need a prescription from a physician to get a COVID test...it’s appalling to me at this point," Mina said. He said looking at the early days brings up "our inability to really rise to the challenge as governing agencies and policymakers to really tackle this virus in the way that it needed". — Euronews < Previous PageNext Page > March 11, 2021 750 views HIGHLIGHTS World UN nuclear watchdog chief to visit Iran 15 hours ago UN nuclear watchdog chief to visit Iran World Biden and Trump to meet in Oval Office on Wednesday for postelection meeting 16 hours ago Biden and Trump to meet in Oval Office on Wednesday for postelection meeting World Indonesia's president calls for collaboration with China as new deals worth $10 billion are signed 16 hours ago Indonesia's president calls for collaboration with China as new deals worth $10 billion are signed COPYRIGHT © 2024 WWW.SAUDIGAZETTE.COM.SA - ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Powered by NewsPress NEWS CATEGORY saudi arabia world opinion business sports life advertisements COMPANY about us Epaper contact us Archive OTHER Epaper contact us Archive‘Normal’ to feel a bit unwell after COVID vaccine | Practice Business See final frame for AE reporting.

But people must not be deterred from having the vaccine, which saves lives, the Royal College of GPs says. After-effects are usually mild and disappear within days, experts say. But they can still feel quite grim. David Kidd, 49, from Yorkshire, was unprepared for the cluster of symptoms he experienced shortly after his first dose. “I had heard that there were some possible ones,” he says. “They do say you might get flu-like symptoms but I was not expecting to get lots of them together. “I had the vaccine at 12:00 on Saturday and I felt fine for the rest of the day, until about 18:00 that evening.” Kidd had: body achesa fevera headachesore eyesnauseaa temperaturefreezing cold extremities “It felt like I had plunged my hands and feet into ice or a freezer,” he says. “It was really painful and my head was banging away. It was the worst headache I have ever had in my life. “And my eyes were burning, along with the obligatory nausea. “I couldn’t get comfortable all through the night.” Side-effects that may affect more than one in 10 people after the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine or the Pfizer-BioNTech shot include: tenderness, pain, warmth, itching or bruising where the injection was givengenerally feeling unwellfeeling tired (fatigue)chills or feeling feverishheadachefeeling sick (nausea)joint pain or muscle ache Side-effects affecting up to one in 10 include: swelling, redness or a lump at the injection sitefeverbeing sick (vomiting) or diarrhoeaflu-like symptoms, such as high temperature, sore throat, runny nose, cough and chills Allergy to the vaccine is very rare. Prof Martin Marshall, from the Royal College of GPs, said: “Patients should be assured that both COVID-19 vaccines currently being used in the UK have gone through a rigorous process to ensure they are both safe and effective. “It is normal, as with most vaccinations, for some patients to experience mild side-effects. “If required, we would recommend that patients treat these with painkillers, such as paracetamol.” However, if symptoms become much worse or cause concern patients should seek medical help by calling 111, their GP practice or, in an emergency, 999, he added. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency’s Yellow Card scheme allows people, such as Kidd, to report any vaccine side-effects. And those logged for the millions of COVID-19 shots given were ”broadly similar” to other vaccines in routine use, chief executive Dr June Raine said. Meanwhile, data from the Zoe Covid Symptom Study – which has received feedback, submitted via an app, from more than 280,000 people – suggests fatigue, headache and chills are more likely to be experienced by: womenyounger peoplethose who have had COVID Younger people and the slightly more women than men who have more side-effects may just have fitter immune systems, lead scientist Prof Tim Spector, at King’s College London, said. And this strong immune reaction may provide even greater protection from just a single shot of the vaccine – although people should still have the recommended two doses. “If someone has had previous COVID, it is a bit like they are primed,” he said. “And their body is ready to fight it again.” The Yellow Card data, however, shows no link between COVID infections and vaccine after-effects. But it aims to record any severe reactions rather than every mild one. And Public Health England says people who have had COVID should still be vaccinated, to protect themselves and others. Prof Spector said: “You are going to be less ill than getting COVID. “Do not delay or avoid getting your dose. “We are urging as many people as possible to download the Zoe app and log their vaccines with us, so that we can independently monitor how we all react differently and how the vaccines impact the overall pandemic.” Don’t forget to follow us on Twitter like us on Facebook or connect with us on LinkedIn!Have you read?
