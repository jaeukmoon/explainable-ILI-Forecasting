This page has resources to help answer your questions about flu vaccines. Prevention steps and strategies Take time to get a flu vaccine. Everyone 6 months and older should get a flu vaccine every season, especially people at higher risk. CDC recommends a yearly flu vaccine as the first and most important action in reducing your risk of flu and its potentially serious outcomes. Flu vaccines help to reduce the burden of flu illnesses, hospitalizations and deaths on the health care system each year. (Read more about flu vaccine benefits.) Flu vaccination also has been shown to reduce the severity of illness in people who get vaccinated but still get sick. For 2024-2025, all flu vaccines will be designed to protect against three influenza viruses (Visit Vaccine Virus Selection for this season's vaccine composition.) Everyone 6 months and older should get an annual flu vaccine, ideally by the end of October but people should continue to get vaccinated as long as flu viruses pose a threat to their community. Vaccination of people at higher risk of developing serious flu complications is especially important to decrease their risk of severe flu illness. People at higher risk of serious flu complications include young children, pregnant people, people with certain chronic health conditions like asthma, diabetes or heart and lung disease, and people 65 years and older. Vaccination also is important for health care workers and other people who live with or care for people at higher risk of serious flu illness to keep from spreading flu to them. This is especially true for people who work in long-term care facilities, which are home to many of the people most vulnerable to flu. Children younger than 6 months are at higher risk of serious flu illness but are too young to be vaccinated. People who care for infants should be vaccinated instead. Take everyday preventive actions to stop the spread of germs. Take actions every day to help stop the spread of germs. Getting a flu vaccine is the most important. Take other preventive actions in addition to vaccination that may help reduce the spread of viruses like flu. Avoid close contact with people who are sick. If you are sick, limit contact with others as much as possible to keep from infecting them. For flu, CDC recommends that people stay home, for at least 24 hours, until both are true: your symptoms are getting better overall, and you have not had fever (and are not using fever-reducing medication)*. About Preventing Spread of Respiratory Viruses When You're Sick | What To Do If You Get Sick. After these two criteria are met, there are some additional precautions that can be taken to protect others from respiratory illness. These include taking steps for cleaner air and hygiene practices like cleaning frequently touched surfaces. More information is available about core and additional prevention strategies. Cover coughs and sneezes. Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Throw the tissue in the trash after you use it. Wearing a mask is an additional prevention strategy that you can choose to further protect yourself and others. When worn by a person with an infection, masks reduce the spread of the virus to others. Masks can also protect wearers from breathing in infectious particles from people around them. Wash your hands often with soap and water. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand rub. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth. Germs spread this way. You can improve air quality by bringing in fresh outside air, purifying indoor air, or gathering outdoors. Cleaner air can reduce the risk of exposure to viruses. Treatment Take flu antiviral drugs if your doctor prescribes them. If you are sick with flu, antiviral drugs can be used to treat your illness. Antiviral drugs are different from antibiotics. They are prescription medicines (pills, liquid or an inhaled powder) and are not available over-the-counter. Flu antiviral drugs can make flu illness milder and shorten the time you are sick. They may also prevent serious flu complications. For people at higher risk of serious flu illness, treatment with an antiviral drug can mean the difference between having a milder illness and having a very serious illness that could result in a hospital stay. Studies show that flu antiviral drugs work best for treatment when they are started within 2 days of getting sick, but starting them later can still be helpful, especially if the sick person is at higher risk of severe flu illness or is very sick from flu. If you are at higher risk of severe flu illness and get flu symptoms, call your health care provider early so you can be treated with flu antivirals if needed. Follow your doctor's instructions for taking this drug. Flu symptoms include fever, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, body aches, headache, chills and fatigue. Some people also may have vomiting and diarrhea. People may be infected with influenza virus and have respiratory symptoms without a fever. Visit CDC's website to find out what to do if you get sick with flu. Learn about some of the similarities and differences between flu and COVID-19, and the difference between flu and the common cold. There are prescription medications called “flu antiviral drugs” that can be used to treat flu illness.

It's a major threat to the poultry industry, animal health, trade, and the economy worldwide. Caused by influenza type A viruses, the disease varies in severity depending on the strain and species affected. Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) strains are deadly to domestic poultry and can wipe out entire flocks within a matter of days. Low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) strains typically cause few or no signs of illness. They occur naturally in wild birds around the world. However, some LPAI strains can become highly pathogenic in poultry. Note: Avian influenza A viruses rarely infect people. For more information on human health and avian influenza, visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. What To Look For Highly Pathogenic Avian InfluenzaSudden death without any prior symptoms of illnessLack of energy and appetiteA drop in egg production or soft-shelled, misshapen eggsSwelling of the eyelids, comb, wattles, and shanksPurple discoloration of the wattles, comb, and legsGasping for air (difficulty breathing)Nasal discharge, coughing, sneezingTwisting of the head and neck (torticollis)Stumbling or falling downDiarrheaLow Pathogenicity Avian InfluenzaLPAI-infected poultry usually don't show any signs of illness. If they do, you may see mild to severe respiratory distress, lack of energy and appetite, decreased egg production, and diarrhea. How To Prevent This Disease Avian influenza viruses spread through direct, bird-to-bird contact. They can also spread via contaminated surfaces or materials, such as manure; egg flats, crates, or other farming materials and equipment; and people's clothing, shoes, or hands.Biosecurity is key to protecting your flock.

For example, quarantine or controlled marketing may also be appropriate.If your farm is ever affected by LPAI, Federal and State officials will work with you to determine what options are available. Report Signs of Animal DiseaseProducers or owners who suspect an animal disease should contact their veterinarian to evaluate the animal or herd. Find an accredited veterinarian.Animal health professionals (veterinarians; diagnostic laboratories; public health, zoo, or wildlife personnel; and others) report diagnosed or suspected cases of nationally listed reportable animal diseases to APHIS Area Veterinarians in Charge and to the State animal health official as applicable under State reporting regulations. Controlling Avian Influenza Current Status Detections of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza APHIS' Response APHIS works closely with States and the poultry industry to prevent avian influenza from becoming established in the U.S. poultry population. Our work takes place on a number of fronts.Prevention and ControlAPHIS cooperates with States, industry, and others to carry out avian influenza prevention and control programs. These programs provide uniform standards (270.6 KB) to prevent and control H5/H7 avian influenza in flocks of all sizes, including commercial flocks, household flocks, and live bird markets. APHIS coordinates the programs and provides resources to help States implement standards.Emergency Preparedness and ResponseWe respond quickly to contain and eliminate avian influenza when findings occur. With LPAI detections, APHIS provides expertise, funding, and support personnel to States. Each U.S. State and Territory should have an Initial State Response and Containment Plan (sometimes referred to as an ISRCP or Low Path Plan) that indicates procedures for responding to an LPAI detection. Information regarding the ISRCP can be obtained by working with a Poultry Health or National Poultry Improvement Plan team member.With HPAI detections, APHIS coordinates the emergency response, working closely with Federal, State, Tribal, and industry partners.Visit HPAI Emergency Response for more information.Import RestrictionsAPHIS maintains trade restrictions on the import of poultry and poultry products from countries and/or regions affected by avian influenza. We also work closely with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to monitor for illegally smuggled poultry and poultry products. In addition, APHIS quarantines and tests all imported live birds* to ensure they are free of avian influenza before entering the country.*Except from Canada, which must have appropriate permitsSurveillance in Domestic PoultryAPHIS works closely with Federal, State, and industry partners to monitor U.S. poultry populations for avian influenza. Our surveillance targets several key areas: the live bird marketing system (270.6 KB), commercial breeding and production flocks, and backyard flocks.National Poultry Improvement Plan Surveillance for Avian Influenza in Wild Birds Because wild birds can carry avian influenza and not appear sick, APHIS works with other Federal and State partners to conduct surveillance testing on wild birds. These tests tell us whether any HPAI viruses—or influenza viruses that could mutate into highly pathogenic strains—are found in the wild bird population.Wild Bird Plans2024–2025 Implementation Plan for Avian Influenza Surveillance in Waterfowl in the United States (1.6 MB)U.S. Interagency Strategic Plan for Early Detection and Monitoring for Avian Influenzas of Significance in Wild Birds (1.63 MB)To learn more, visit our National Wildlife Disease Program and Wild Bird Avian Influenza Surveillance dashboard.Send an email to aphisweb@usda.gov to request copies of Wild Bird Avian Influenza Surveillance Data reports and HPAI Findings in Wild Birds reports produced between 2015 and 2021.

We know that seasonal influenza activity, along with other respiratory viruses will continue increasing in the coming weeks and months. Respiratory viruses, which include influenza (flu), COVID-19, and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) are highly contagious and present a severe threat to the public’s health. Annual vaccination is the best way to protect against severe illness due to influenza. The CT Department of Public Health (DPH) and CT Immunization Coalition have partnered with Local Health Departments to provide a list of flu clinics around the state (see schedule below). You can also visit vaccines.gov or easyvax.com to find a pharmacy offering influenza vaccination in your area. DPH strongly recommends that persons 6 months of age and older get an annual flu shot. Several local health departments and districts plan to offer vaccinations to children and adults. Check for information on clinic dates, homebound services and vaccines offered by Local Health Departments here. If your town is not listed, please visit this link to find which local health department your town is part of, or consider checking with your healthcare provider or local pharmacy. Many insurance companies cover the cost of the flu shot. Bring a current insurance card to the vaccination clinic.

To bridge these gaps, WHO convened a global consultation and published the Public Health Research Agenda for Influenza 2009. In 2017, an update was published after extensive consultations, identifying high-priority areas in influenza research to reduce the burden of seasonal epidemic influenza, and the risk and impact of pandemic influenza. The 2017 research agenda defined five areas of work: Stream 1. Reducing the risk of emergence of pandemic influenza Stream 2. Limiting the spread of pandemic, zoonotic and seasonal epidemic influenza Stream 3. Minimizing the impact of pandemic, zoonotic and seasonal epidemic influenza Stream 4. Optimizing the treatment of patients Stream 5. Promoting the development and application of modern public health tools Sub-stream 5A: New Technologies in Public Health, and Mathematical Modelling Sub-stream 5B: Social Media Tools and Risk Communication The recent COVID-19 pandemic, although due to a non-influenza virus, has broadened knowledge in areas of transmission, pharmaceutical interventions, and non-pharmaceutical measures. Meanwhile influenza virus has been constantly evolving causing epidemics in humans, spilling to new species, including mammals, such as the recent avian influenza outbreak in dairy cattle, and imposing pandemic threat to humans.In this context, there is a pressing need to update the WHO Public Health Research Agenda for Influenza. To address the need, in early 2024 WHO established virtual work streams corresponding to the above defined Streams.Scope and objectivesThe overall aim of the meeting is to review the progress from all work streams and finalize the process towards the completion of update of the WHO Public Health Research Agenda for Influenza, with specific objectives to:Review findings from systematic literature reviews commissioned by WHO and discuss progress made since the 2017, Review progress of the work by work streams so far, providing feedback and recommending adjustments, Identify and analyse knowledge gaps cross all work streams, and develop strategies to address them for the update of research agenda, and Produce a first draft of high-priority areas in influenza research.In addition, high priority research questions for low- and middle-income countries will also be discussed.Participants (by invitation)Leads and co-leads of the five work streamsLiterature reviewers, andOther external and WHO experts Regions Africa Americas Eastern Mediterranean Europe South-East Asia Western Pacific Policies Cybersecurity Ethics Information disclosure Permissions and licensing Preventing sexual exploitation Terms of use About us Careers Frequently asked questions Library Newsletters Procurement Publications Contact us Report misconduct Privacy policy © 2024 WHOMDARD - Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Detected in Van Buren County Dairy Herd Skip to main content Agriculture and Rural Development Agriculture & Rural Development About MDARD About MDARD collapsed link Animals Animals collapsed link Business Development Business Development collapsed link Environment Environment collapsed link Food & Dairy Food & Dairy collapsed link Lab Services Lab Services collapsed link Licensing Licensing collapsed link Plant & Pest Plant & Pest collapsed link About MDARD Go to About MDARD Bureaus Reports and Notices Boards, Councils, and Commissions Contact Us / File a Complaint Emergency Preparedness Michigan Food and Agriculture Industry Jobs Laws and Regulations Media Room Online Services Bureaus Go to Bureaus Learn about MDARD's four bureaus, including contact information, by clicking the above link, or view specific information below.

Supported Browsers Google Chrome Safari Microsoft Edge Firefox Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Detected in Van Buren County Dairy Herd About MDARD Media Room August 26, 2024 Today, Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (MDARD) Director Tim Boring announced the detection of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in a dairy herd from Van Buren County, bringing the total number of affected dairy herds in Michigan to 28. Testing through the Michigan State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory initially detected this case. Samples have been sent to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) National Veterinary Services Laboratories for additional confirmatory testing. Regardless of the species, biosecurity remains the best tool available to combat HPAI. On May 1, 2024, Director Boring issued the Determination of Extraordinary Emergency HPAI Risk Reduction and Response Order (HRRRO). In addition to other protocols, the order requires all dairy operations in Michigan to adopt enhanced biosecurity measures, collectively reducing the risk of introducing this virus on to farms. The order also prohibits the exhibition of all lactating dairy cattle, and those in the last two months of pregnancy, until there are no new cases of HPAI in Michigan dairy cattle for at least 60 consecutive days. No dairy cattle of any age from an infected premises may be exhibited until further notice. In addition to these requirements, following a few key steps can also be fundamental to protecting the health and vitality of Michigan's dairy cattle: Delay or stop incoming or returning animals from herds with unknown or suspect health status. Isolate all animals that are new or returning to your farm. Monitor the health of your animals daily. Contact your veterinarian if there are ever any animal health-related concerns or if you would like to develop a secure food supply plan. Sick animals should have dedicated equipment and be cared for after tending to healthy animals first. Clothing, footwear, and equipment worn/used around sick animals should not be worn/used around other animals until they are cleaned and disinfected. Use an EPA-registered disinfectant effective against avian influenza. Do not share tools, equipment, trailers, etc. with other farms. Clean and disinfect the interiors of trailers used to haul animals from other operations. Limit non-essential visitors to your farm. If individuals have recently been on a poultry farm, they should not visit a dairy operation, and vice versa. Require or provide clean clothing and footwear to those entering your farm. Use hand-washing stations and provide gloves to those working on your farm. As part of the disease response, MDARD is working with the herd veterinarian to monitor the health of the animals and conduct trace investigations. Additionally, MDARD and various federal and state partners continue to offer personal protective equipment at the request of dairy operations. The department continues to diligently work with local, state, and federal partners to quickly respond to reports of HPAI to mitigate the spread of the disease and provide outreach. ### MI Newswire Department of Agriculture and Rural Development HPAI Alerts Author: Jennifer Holton MDARD Media Contact HoltonJ@Michigan.gov 517-284-5724 Related News MI Commission of Agriculture and Rural Development Approve 2025 Generally Accepted Agricultural and Management Practices Gov Whitmer Proclaims November as Michigan Craft Beverage Month to Celebrate Michigan Businesses MDARD, MDHHS, and MDNR Proudly Recognize One Health Day MDARD Announces Request for Joint Evaluation Committee Volunteers for Economic Development Grants Dr Laura Johnson Joins MDARD as Chief Science Officer State Veterinarian Statement on West Nile Virus-Positive Tuscola County Horse MDARD Encourages Owners to Help Keep Animals Safe this Halloween MDARD’s Plant Pathology Laboratory Achieves Nation’s First Core Accreditation from the National Plant Diagnostic Network Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development Announces Specialty Crop Block Grant Public Input Opportunity Governor Whitmer Proclaims October as Michigan Agritourism Month Follow us Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Detected in Van Buren County Dairy Herd Copyright State of Michigan AboutThe Michigan Department of Agriculture & Rural Development (MDARD) works to assure food safety, protect animal and plant health, sustain environmental stewardship, provide consumer protection, enable rural development and foster efficient administration operations through service, partnership and collaboration.

In this trial, we sought to further refine these strategies and investigated whether the effectiveness of the strategies could be sustained across consecutive influenza seasons. We enrolled all eligible Danish citizens 65 years of age or older in a nationwide registry-based randomized implementation trial during the 2023–2024 influenza season. Households of participants were randomly assigned in a 2.45:1:1:1:1:1:1 ratio to usual care or six different behaviorally informed electronic letter-based nudges delivered before the influenza vaccination period. The primary endpoint was receipt of influenza vaccination. Statistical analyses accounted for household-level clustering. A total of 881,373 participants (mean age 74.1 ± 6.5 years, 52.1% female) were randomized across 649,487 households. The primary endpoint was met; influenza vaccination rates were higher in the pooled intervention letter group compared to usual care (76.32% versus 76.02%; difference, 0.31 percentage points; 99.29% confidence interval, 0.00–0.61; P = 0.007). Although no individual letter significantly increased influenza vaccination rates, the directionality of effect was consistent across all letters. Effectiveness was particularly pronounced in participants who had not received influenza vaccination during the preceding season (Pinteraction = 0.010). Effectiveness was consistent regardless of whether participants had received a similar electronic letter-based nudge in the preceding season (Pinteraction = 0.26). In summary, electronic letter-based nudges successfully increased influenza vaccination among older adults, and our results suggest that these highly scalable strategies can be implemented effectively and safely across consecutive vaccination seasons.ClinicalTrials.gov registration: NCT06030726.

Direct Relief / Flickr cc Though it's important to consider Southern Hemisphere flu activity ahead of the upcoming US flu season, the CDC emphasized that patterns there don't always predict how the season will unfold in the United States. Differences in predominant flu viruses and population immunity can contribute to regional variations, it added.Mix of subregional flu patternsIn the Southern Hemisphere, flu activity this season varied by virus strain, severity, and timing. In South America, H3N2 was the main strain, and Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay had an early start to their seasons. Chile's activity was very high, and Chile, Ecuador, and Uruguay had high levels of severe disease.In contrast, H1N1 was dominant in the African region, with Zambia reporting an early start to the season and very high levels of illness and severe disease. Activity continues—now mostly from influenza B—in South Africa and Zambia.H3N2 was predominant in the Oceania region. The timing of Australia's season was similar to pre-COVID years and similar to its 2023 flu season. Flu activity reached the moderate level and has been decreasing in recent weeks, though several areas are seeing upward trends.The Southern Hemisphere's flu season typically runs from April through September, but it can sometimes extend into October or November, the CDC said."Vaccination remains the best defense against flu and even if vaccination does not prevent the risk of flu entirely, it can help reduce the severity of flu illness in people who get flu despite being vaccinated," the CDC said "In the United States, September and October are generally good times to be vaccinated against flu." Report details COVID-related healthcare worker attacks, injuries, deaths around the world News brief Mary Van Beusekom, MS Topics COVID-19 CentralITAlliance / iStock During the first 3 years of the pandemic, at least 255 healthcare workers (HCWs) around the world were attacked, 18 were killed, 147 were injured, and 86 facilities were damaged, finds a report published last week in Health Security.Led by researchers in the Netherlands, the study extracted data on global COVID-related attacks against HCWs from the Safeguarding Health in Conflict Coalition database from January 2020 to January 2023. The team included incidents related to COVID-19 public health measures or interference with COVID-19 care, including attacks related to conflict."During the COVID-19 pandemic, violence targeting healthcare reportedly increased," the researchers wrote. "Attacks against healthcare can severely hamper the public health response during a pandemic."Likely an undercountDuring the study period, 255 COVID-19-related attacks on HCWs were reported, with 18 killed and 147 injured, in addition to damage to 86 facilities. Attacks were most common at the beginning of the pandemic and primarily consisted of "stigma-related" attacks on HCWs. The findings of this study emphasize the importance of public education campaigns, improved coordination between healthcare organizations and law enforcement, and the possible need to bolster the security of medical facilities and health workers.Incidents in 2021 included those against vaccination campaigns and conflict-related attacks that interfered with COVID-19 care. Such incidents were reported in heterogeneous contexts throughout the pandemic."Due to underreporting, the data presented are a minimum estimate of the actual magnitude of violence," the study authors wrote. "The findings of this study emphasize the importance of public education campaigns, improved coordination between healthcare organizations and law enforcement, and the possible need to bolster the security of medical facilities and health workers." German study finds concerning rate of resistant E coli in cats and dogs News brief Chris Dall, MA Topics Antimicrobial Stewardship E coli adogslifephoto / iStock An analysis of veterinary data from Germany found that about 12% of Escherichia coli isolates from the country's dogs and cats are resistant to third-generation cephalosporins, researchers reported yesterday in PLOS One.In the study, a team led by researchers from Germany's Institute of Veterinary Epidemiology and Biostatistics analyzed antimicrobial susceptibility test results obtained from 3,491 veterinary practices in Germany (33% of all practices nationwide) from 2019 through 2021 through GERM-Vet, Germany's monitoring system for resistant pathogenic bacteria in animals. Out of 175,171 samples, they evaluated 25,491 E coli strains for resistance to several antibiotic classes, focusing on cefovecin, the only third-generation cephalosporin approved for veterinary use. Third-generation cephalosporin-resistant E coli is considered a significant health threat in both people and animals, and the study authors note that cefovecin resistance can be reasonably compared to resistance to other third-generation cephalosporins. Third-generation cephalosporin-resistant E coli in companion animals is a particular concern because of the potential for transmission to owners."Due to the close contact between pet animals and their owners, information on resistance-carrying pathogens in companion animals is crucial for human health as well," the study authors wrote. "Knowledge about the occurrence and distribution are needed to gain further understanding and contribute to the One Health aspect of AMR [antimicrobial resistance]."Data highlight need for integrated AMR surveillanceThe proportion of E coli isolates that were resistant to cefovecin was 11.6%, with a similar proportion found in dogs (11.6%) and cats (11.7%). But there was notable local variation, with some regions showing resistance proportions around 15%. In addition, cefovecin-resistant E coli showed higher resistance levels to other antibiotics, specifically 30% for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 28% for chloramphenicol, 18% for enrofloxacin, and 14% for gentamicin.The authors acknowledge that more research is needed to determine how often third-generation cephalosporin-resistant E coli is exchanged between pets and their owners, but they say the findings demonstrate the importance of integrated AMR surveillance."Accurate knowledge of antibiotic resistance in animal pathogens is crucial for the optimal use of antibiotics and benefits human and animal health," they concluded. Study describes epidemiology of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales in South Africa News brief Chris Dall, MA Topics Antimicrobial Stewardship Stephanie Rossow / CDC Data collected from hospitals in South Africa's third most populous province highlight the patients who are bearing the burden of rising rates of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) in the country, researchers reported yesterday in PLOS One.Using routine clinical and laboratory datasets, researchers from Stellenbosch University analyzed all CRE episodes (including clinical episodes and carriage) at hospitals in Western Cape province from 2016 through 2020. With CRE becoming an increasing problem at hospitals across the country but little local data on it, they wanted to describe the epidemiology of CRE carriage and infection, examine patient demographics and resistance phenotypes, and identify factors associated with mortality.A total of 2,242 CRE episodes (70.5% clinical episodes and 29.5% carriage) were identified over the study period. Among the 2,281 CRE isolates identified, the most common species were Klebsiella spp (72.1%), Enterobacter cloacae (15.1%), and Escherichia coli (5.5%). Affected patients were mostly male (52%) and had a median age of 31 years. Most CRE episodes occurred in hospitalized patients (93%) and were recorded in central hospitals (70%).The proportions of CRE isolates that were non-susceptible to imipenem and meropenem were 77.6% and 74.6%, respectively, and resistance to other beta-lactam antibiotics exceeded 98%. Factors associated with deathAmong the 2,109 CRE episodes with available outcome data, 20.4% of patients died; crude in-hospital mortality rates were significantly higher for CRE clinical episodes (26.9%) than for CRE carriage episodes (6.4%). Factors that showed a statistically significant association with in-hospital mortality were female sex (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.40; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09 to 1.56)], adult patients (aOR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.20 to 2.57), CRE isolation from a sterile specimen (aOR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.32 to 0.53), and more than 3 days between hospital admission and specimen collection (aOR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.11 to 2.18)."It is important to identify these factors to improve patient outcomes, to guide treatment strategies, enhance infection prevention and control (IPC) measures and to address the broader public health and economic implications of CRE infections," the study authors wrote. "This ultimately impacts the greater fight against [antimicrobial resistance] and the improvement of health care."

Home Patients & Visitors Healthy You Blogs Influenza season is here 6 reasons to get a flu shot Icon Label Icon Label Twitter Icon Label Icon Label Influenza season is here: 6 reasons to get a flu shot August 28, 2024 Primary Care Healthy Aging Wellness Though influenza viruses are always circulating, more people in the U.S. typically catch the flu in fall and winter. We call these months the “flu season,” and it’s the ideal time to get your annual flu shot. “You’ll have the best protection against flu if you get the vaccine at the beginning of fall, before flu cases start to rise,” says Melanie Ames, FNP, Family Nurse Practitioner at the Charlie W. and Golden Bethune Hill Community Health Clinic. Since cases of the flu usually start to increase around October and peak between December and February, the months of September and October are the best times to make your flu shot appointment. However, you can get the vaccine at any time during flu season and still decrease your risk. “Just keep in mind that it takes about two weeks for your body to make the antibodies that protect it from the virus after you get the flu vaccine,” Ames adds. “And children who need two doses should get vaccinated as soon as possible since the two doses must be given four weeks apart.” If you’re on the fence about getting a flu shot, here are six statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that will make you say “yes” to the flu vaccine this year – and every year: When the flu vaccine “viruses” match the flu viruses that are spreading in your community, you are 40-60% less likely to need to visit the doctor with the flu. If you get vaccinated but still get the flu, you may have less severe symptoms than if you don’t get vaccinated and get the flu. If you get vaccinated but still get the flu and you require hospitalization, you are 59% less likely to need ICU care than if you don’t get vaccinated and require hospitalization. In older adults, the flu vaccine reduces the risk of flu-associated hospitalizations by an average of 40%. In children with underlying high-risk medical conditions, the flu vaccine reduces the risk of flu-associated death by 51% – in healthy children, the vaccine reduces the risk by nearly 65%. Besides protecting yourself, the flu vaccine may also help you protect other people, including those who are more vulnerable to the virus. Doctors recommend that everyone over the age of 6 months get the flu shot once a year. Riverside offers free flu shots for those age 14 and up while supplies last.

August 26, 2020Media Contact: Bobbi Nodell - bnodell@uw.edu, 206.543.7129 Getty Images "Our team motto is 'Get a flu shot,' " said lead author Eric Chow, a UW Medicine fellow of allergy and infectious diseases.The link between influenza and serious heart conditions just grew stronger. A CDC study looking at more than 80,000 adult patients hospitalized with flu over eight seasons found that sudden, serious heart complications were common, occurring in 12% of patients, or 1 in 8. “Previous to our study, there had been suggestions between the link, but our study shows just how common it is,” said lead author Eric Chow, an infectious diseases fellow at University of Washington School of Medicine. The study, published Aug. 25 in the Annals of Internal Medicine, underscores the importance of getting a flu shot early. “There are few respiratory viruses we have a vaccine for,” he said. “Our team motto is 'Get a flu shot.'” Chow previously worked as an epidemic intelligence service officer, or “disease detective,” for influenza at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The study found that 5% of patients hospitalized with the flu had a cardiac complication despite having no documented underlying conditions. In the past month, there have been cases of otherwise healthy athletes showing signs of heart complications after recovering from COVID-19. For example, 27-year-old Florida State basketball player Michael Ojo, who recovered from COVID-19, died of an apparent heart attack at a practice. Chow said he is not surprised this is happening to healthy people who have been infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The virus can cause damage to the lungs and other organs, including the heart. Inflammation makes hearts vulnerable to potentially fatal arrhythmias during vigorous exercise. In this study of adults hospitalized with flu, 12% had acute heart complications. Of these, 30% were admitted to the ICU and 7% died while in the hospital. The CDC recommends that everyone 6 months and older get a flu vaccine every flu season. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, flu vaccination is always considered important for people at high risk of developing serious flu complications, including people with heart disease. Flu shots are approved for people with heart disease, but people with heart disease should not receive the live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV, also known as the nasal spray flu vaccine). However any intramuscular flu shot, such as any inactivated or recombinant influenza vaccine, would be appropriate. For details about UW Medicine, please visit http://uwmedicine.org/about.

Routine annual influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons aged ≥6 months who do not have contraindications. Trivalent inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV3s), trivalent recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV3), and trivalent live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV3) are expected to be available. All persons should receive an age-appropriate influenza vaccine (i.e., one approved for their age), with the exception that solid organ transplant recipients aged 18 through 64 years who are receiving immunosuppressive medication regimens may receive either high-dose inactivated influenza vaccine (HD-IIV3) or adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine (aIIV3) as acceptable options (without a preference over other age-appropriate IIV3s or RIV3). Except for vaccination for adults aged ≥65 years, ACIP makes no preferential recommendation for a specific vaccine when more than one licensed and recommended vaccine is available. ACIP recommends that adults aged ≥65 years preferentially receive any one of the following higher dose or adjuvanted influenza vaccines: trivalent high-dose inactivated influenza vaccine (HD-IIV3), trivalent recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV3), or trivalent adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine (aIIV3). If none of these three vaccines is available at an opportunity for vaccine administration, then any other age-appropriate influenza vaccine should be used. Primary updates to this report include the following two topics: the composition of 2024–25 U.S. seasonal influenza vaccines and updated recommendations for vaccination of adult solid organ transplant recipients. First, following a period of no confirmed detections of wild-type influenza B/Yamagata lineage viruses in global surveillance since March 2020, 2024–25 U.S. influenza vaccines will not include an influenza B/Yamagata component. All influenza vaccines available in the United States during the 2024–25 season will be trivalent vaccines containing hemagglutinin derived from 1) an influenza A/Victoria/4897/2022 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus (for egg-based vaccines) or an influenza A/Wisconsin/67/2022 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus (for cell culture-based and recombinant vaccines); 2) an influenza A/Thailand/8/2022 (H3N2)-like virus (for egg-based vaccines) or an influenza A/Massachusetts/18/2022 (H3N2)-like virus (for cell culture-based and recombinant vaccines); and 3) an influenza B/Austria/1359417/2021 (Victoria lineage)-like virus. Second, recommendations for vaccination of adult solid organ transplant recipients have been updated to include HD-IIV3 and aIIV3 as acceptable options for solid organ transplant recipients aged 18 through 64 years who are receiving immunosuppressive medication regimens (without a preference over other age-appropriate IIV3s or RIV3). This report focuses on recommendations for the use of vaccines for the prevention and control of seasonal influenza during the 2024–25 influenza season in the United States. A brief summary of the recommendations and a link to the most recent Background Document containing additional information are available at https://www.cdc.gov/acip-recs/hcp/vaccine-specific/flu.html?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/vacc-specific/flu.html. These recommendations apply to U.S.-licensed influenza vaccines. Updates and other information are available from CDC’s influenza website (https://www.cdc.gov/flu). Vaccination and health care providers should check this site periodically for additional information. Top Introduction Influenza viruses typically circulate annually in the United States, most commonly from the late fall through the early spring. Most persons who become ill after influenza virus infection recover without serious complications or sequelae. However, influenza can be associated with serious illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths, particularly among older adults, very young children, pregnant persons, and persons of all ages with certain chronic medical conditions (1–7). Influenza also is an important cause of missed work and school (8–10). Routine annual influenza vaccination for all persons aged ≥6 months who do not have contraindications has been recommended by CDC and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) since 2010 (11). Vaccination provides important protection from influenza illness and its potential complications. The effectiveness of influenza vaccination varies depending on multiple factors such as the age and health of the recipient, the type of vaccine administered, the types and subtypes of influenza viruses circulating in the community, and the degree of similarity between circulating viruses and those included in the vaccine (12). During each of the six influenza seasons from 2010–11 through 2015–16, influenza vaccination prevented an estimated 1.6–6.7 million illnesses, 790,000–3.1 million outpatient medical visits, 39,000–87,000 hospitalizations, and 3,000–10,000 respiratory and circulatory deaths each season in the United States (13). During the severe 2017–18 season, notable for an unusually long duration of widespread high influenza activity throughout the United States and higher rates of outpatient visits and hospitalizations compared with recent seasons, vaccination prevented an estimated 7.1 million illnesses, 3.7 million medical visits, 109,000 hospitalizations, and 8,000 deaths (14), despite an overall estimated vaccine effectiveness of 38% (62% against influenza A[H1N1]pdm09 viruses, 22% against influenza A[H3N2] viruses, and 50% against influenza B viruses) (14). This report updates the 2023–24 ACIP recommendations regarding the use of seasonal influenza vaccines (15) and provides recommendations and guidance for vaccination providers regarding the use of influenza vaccines in the United States for the 2024–25 season. Various formulations of influenza vaccines are available (Table 1). Contraindications and precautions for the use of influenza vaccines are summarized (Tables 2 and 3). Abbreviations are used in this report to denote the various types of vaccines (Box). A summary of these recommendations and a Background Document containing additional information on influenza, influenza-associated illness, and influenza vaccines are available at https://www.cdc.gov/acip-recs/hcp/vaccine-specific/flu.html?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/vacc-specific/flu.html. Top Methods ACIP provides annual recommendations for the use of influenza vaccines for the prevention and control of seasonal influenza in the United States. The ACIP Influenza Work Group meets by teleconference once to twice per month throughout the year. Work Group membership includes multiple voting members of ACIP, representatives of ACIP liaison organizations, and consultants. Discussions include topics such as influenza surveillance, vaccine effectiveness and safety, vaccination coverage, program feasibility, cost effectiveness, and vaccine supply. Presentations are requested from invited experts and published and unpublished data are discussed. The Background Document that supplements this report contains literature related to recommendations made in previous seasons. The information included in the Background Document for such topics is not a systematic review; it is intended to provide an overview of background literature and is periodically updated with literature being identified primarily through a broad search for English-language articles on influenza and influenza vaccines. In general, longstanding recommendations in this document that were made in previous seasons reflect expert opinion, and systematic review and assessment of evidence was not performed. Systematic review and evidence assessment are not performed for minor wording changes to existing recommendations, changes in the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-recommended viral antigen composition of seasonal influenza vaccines, and minor changes in guidance for the use of influenza vaccines (e.g., guidance for timing of vaccination and other programmatic issues, guidance for dosage in specific populations, guidance for selection of vaccines for specific populations that are already recommended for vaccination, and changes that reflect use that is consistent with FDA-licensed indications and prescribing information). Typically, systematic review and evaluation of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach (16) are performed for new recommendations or substantial changes in the current recommendations (e.g., expansion of the recommendation for influenza vaccination to new populations not previously recommended for vaccination or potential preferential recommendations for specific vaccines). Evidence is reviewed by the ACIP influenza Work Group, and Work Group considerations are included within the ACIP Evidence to Recommendations framework (EtR) (17) to inform the development of recommendations that are proposed for vote by the ACIP. Systematic review, GRADE, and the ACIP EtR framework were used in the development of the updated recommendations for adult solid organ transplant recipients discussed in this report. Top Primary Changes and Updates Primary changes and updates to the recommendations described in this report include 1) the composition of 2024–25 U.S. seasonal influenza vaccines and 2) updated recommendations for vaccination of adult solid organ transplant recipients. Information relevant to these changes includes the following: The composition of the 2024–25 U.S. seasonal influenza vaccines includes an update to the influenza A(H3N2) component. For the 2024–25 season, U.S.-licensed influenza vaccines will contain hemagglutinin (HA) derived from 1) an influenza A/Victoria/4897/2022 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus (for egg-based vaccines) or an influenza A/Wisconsin/67/2022 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus (for cell culture-based and recombinant vaccines, 2) an influenza A/Thailand/8/2022 (H3N2)-like virus (for egg-based vaccines) or an influenza A/Massachusetts/18/2022 (H3N2)-like virus (for cell culture-based and recombinant vaccines), and 3) an influenza B/Austria/1359417/2021 (Victoria lineage)-like virus (for egg-based, cell culture-based, and recombinant vaccines). Recommendations for the composition of Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccines are made by the World Health Organization (WHO), which organizes a consultation, usually in February of each year. Surveillance data are reviewed, and candidate vaccine viruses are discussed. Information about the WHO meeting of February 2024 for selection of the 2024–25 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccine composition is available at https://www.who.int/publications/m/itemecommended-composition-of-influenza-virus-vaccines-for-use-in-the-2024-2025-northern-hemisphere-influenza-season. Subsequently, FDA, which has regulatory authority over vaccines in the United States, convenes a meeting of its Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC). This committee considers the recommendations of WHO, reviews and discusses similar data, and makes a final decision regarding the composition of influenza vaccines licensed and marketed in the United States. Materials from the VRBPAC discussion on March 5, 2024, during which the composition of the 2024–25 U.S. influenza vaccines was discussed, are available at https://www.fda.gov/advisory-committees/advisory-committee-calendar/vaccines-and-related-biological-products-advisory-committee-march-5-2024-meeting-announcement. For the 2024–25 influenza season, FDA has recommended that the U.S. seasonal influenza vaccine composition no longer include influenza B/Yamagata, as there have been no confirmed detections of influenza B/Yamagata viruses in global influenza surveillance since March 2020 (18,19). Recommendations for vaccination of adult solid organ transplant recipients have been updated to include HD-IIV3 and aIIV3 as acceptable options for solid organ transplant recipients aged 18 through 64 years who are receiving immunosuppressive medication regimens (without a preference over other age-appropriate IIVs or RIV3). To inform this recommendation, a systematic review and GRADE of evidence concerning effectiveness and safety of HD-IIV3 and aIIV3 compared with standard-dose unadjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccines was conducted. A summary of this review and the GRADE evidence tables is available at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acipecs/grade/influenza-solid-organ-transplant.html. A summary of the ACIP EtR framework is available at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acipecs/grade/influenza-solid-organ-transplant-etr.html. Top Recommendations for the Use of Influenza Vaccines, 2024–25 Groups Recommended for Vaccination Routine annual influenza vaccination of all persons aged ≥6 months who do not have contraindications continues to be recommended. All persons should receive an age-appropriate influenza vaccine (one that is approved for their age), with the exception that solid organ transplant recipients aged 18 through 64 years who are receiving immunosuppressive medication regimens may receive either HD-IIV3 or aIIV3 as acceptable options (without a preference over other age-appropriate IIV3s or RIV3) (see Immunocompromised Persons). Influenza vaccines expected to be available for the 2024–25 season, their age indications, and their presentations are described (Table 1). ACIP makes no preferential recommendation for the use of any one influenza vaccine over another when more than one licensed and recommended vaccine is available, except for selection of influenza vaccines for persons aged ≥65 years (see Older Adults). Recommendations regarding timing of vaccination, considerations for specific populations, the use of specific vaccines, and contraindications and precautions are summarized in the sections that follow. Timing of Vaccination Timing of the onset, peak, and decline of influenza activity varies from season to season (20). Decisions about timing need to consider the unpredictability of the influenza season, possible waning of vaccine-induced immunity over the course of a season, and practical considerations. For most persons who need only 1 dose of influenza vaccine for the season, vaccination should ideally be offered during September or October. However, vaccination should continue after October and throughout the influenza season as long as influenza viruses are circulating and unexpired vaccine is available. To avoid missed opportunities for vaccination, providers should offer vaccination during routine health care visits and hospitalizations. Revaccination (i.e., providing a booster dose) to persons who have been fully vaccinated for the season is not recommended, regardless of when the current season vaccine was received. Influenza vaccines might be available as early as July or August; however, vaccination during July and August is not recommended for most groups because of potential waning of immunity over the course of the influenza season (21–40), particularly among older adults (21,22,24,31,34,40). However, vaccination during July or August can be considered for any recipient for whom there is concern that they will not be vaccinated at a later date. Considerations for timing of vaccination include the following: For most adults (particularly adults aged ≥65 years) and for pregnant persons in the first or second trimester: Vaccination during July and August should be avoided unless there is concern that vaccination later in the season might not be possible. Children who require 2 doses: Certain children aged 6 months through 8 years require 2 doses of influenza vaccine for the season (see Children Aged 6 Months Through 8 Years: Number of Influenza Vaccine Doses) (Figure). These children should receive their first dose as soon as possible (including during July and August, if vaccine is available) to allow the second dose (which must be administered ≥4 weeks later) to be received, ideally, by the end of October. Children who require only 1 dose: Vaccination during July and August can be considered for children of any age who need only 1 dose of influenza vaccine for the season. Although waning of immunity after vaccination over the course of the season has been observed among all age groups (21–40), there are fewer published studies reporting results specifically among children (21,30,32,33,37,39,40). Moreover, children in this group might visit health care providers during the late summer months for medical examinations before the start of school. Vaccination can be considered at this time because it represents a vaccination opportunity. Pregnant persons in the third trimester: Vaccination during July and August can be considered for pregnant persons who are in the third trimester during these months because vaccination has been associated in multiple studies with reduced risk for influenza illness in their infants during the first months after birth, when they are too young to receive influenza vaccine (41–44). For pregnant persons in the first or second trimester during July and August, waiting to vaccinate until September or October is preferable, unless there is concern that later vaccination might not be possible. An increasing number of observational studies (21–40) have reported decreased vaccine effectiveness with increasing time after vaccination within an influenza season. The rate of waning effectiveness observed in these studies varied considerably and waning effects were inconsistent across age groups, seasons, and influenza virus types and subtypes; although several studies reported faster waning against influenza A(H3N2) viruses than against influenza A(H1N1) or influenza B viruses (25,31,35,40). A meta-analysis of 14 studies examining waning of influenza vaccine effectiveness using the test-negative design found a significant decline in effectiveness after vaccination against influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B but not against influenza A(H1N1) (45). In that study, VE against influenza A(H3N2) declined, on average, by 32 percentage points, from 45% during the first 3 months to 13% in the fourth to sixth months after vaccination. The rate of waning effectiveness also might vary with age; in several studies, waning was more pronounced among older adults (21,22,24,31,34,40). Several recent multiseason studies of waning protection found that the odds of influenza infection increased by 9% to 28% per month after vaccination among vaccinees of all ages and by 12% to 29% per month among vaccinees aged ≥65 years (33,39,40). There are fewer studies of waning specifically among children, with some reporting waning effectiveness (21,32,33,37,40) and others finding no evidence of waning effectiveness (30,39). Complicating the interpretation of studies of waning effectiveness is the fact that observed decreases in protection might be at least partially due to bias, unmeasured confounding, or emergence of antigenic drift variants of influenza viruses that are less well-matched to the vaccine viruses. Community vaccination programs should balance persistence of vaccine-induced protection through the season with avoiding missed opportunities to vaccinate or vaccinating after onset of influenza circulation occurs. Although delaying vaccination might result in greater immunity later in the season, deferral might result in missed opportunities to vaccinate as well as difficulties in vaccinating a population within a more constrained period. Modeling studies examining the consequences of delaying vaccination (until September or October) among older adults in the United States found that delaying vaccination is beneficial if the delay does not cause a substantial reduction in overall vaccination coverage (because of failure of some persons who would prefer earlier vaccination to get vaccinated later in the fall) (46–48). Among older adults, delayed vaccination would be beneficial, on balance, if vaccine coverage declines by no more than 6% in a mild season (47) or by about 15% in a moderately severe season (46,48). However, these results are sensitive to many factors, especially the rate of waning of vaccine effectiveness, about which there remains considerable uncertainty. Vaccination efforts should continue throughout the season because the duration of the influenza season varies, and influenza activity might not occur in certain communities until February, March, or later (20). Providers should offer influenza vaccine at health care visits to those not yet vaccinated, and organized vaccination campaigns should continue throughout the influenza season, including after influenza activity has begun in the community. Although vaccination by the end of October is recommended, vaccine administered in December or later, even if influenza activity has already begun, might be beneficial in most influenza seasons. Providers should offer influenza vaccination to unvaccinated persons who have already become ill with influenza during the season because the vaccine might protect them against other circulating influenza viruses. Guidance for Influenza Vaccination in Specific Populations and Situations Populations at Higher Risk for Medical Complications Attributable to Severe Influenza All persons aged ≥6 months who do not have contraindications should be vaccinated annually. However, vaccination to prevent influenza is particularly important for persons who are at increased risk for severe illness and complications from influenza and for influenza-related outpatient, emergency department, or hospital visits. When vaccine supply is limited, vaccination efforts should focus on vaccination of persons at higher risk for medical complications attributable to severe influenza who do not have contraindications. These persons include the following (order of listing does not imply hierarchy or prioritization among these populations): All children aged 6 through 59 months. All persons aged ≥50 years. Adults and children who have chronic pulmonary (including asthma), cardiovascular (excluding isolated hypertension), renal, hepatic, neurologic, hematologic, or metabolic disorders (including diabetes mellitus). Persons who are immunocompromised due to any cause (including but not limited to immunosuppression caused by medications or HIV infection). Persons who are or will be pregnant during the influenza season. Children and adolescents (aged 6 months through 18 years) who are receiving aspirin- or salicylate-containing medications and who might be at risk for experiencing Reye syndrome after influenza virus infection. Residents of nursing homes and other long-term care facilities. American Indian or Alaska Native persons. Persons who are extremely obese (body mass index ≥40 for adults). IIV3 or RIV3 are suitable for all persons recommended for vaccination, including those in the risk groups listed. LAIV3 is not recommended for certain populations, including certain of these listed groups. Contraindications and precautions for the use of LAIV3 are noted (Table 2). Persons Who Live with or Care for Persons at Higher Risk for Influenza-Related Complications All persons aged ≥6 months without contraindications should be vaccinated annually. However, emphasis also should be placed on vaccination of persons who live with or care for those who are at increased risk for medical complications attributable to severe influenza. When vaccine supply is limited, vaccination efforts should focus on administering vaccination to persons at higher risk for influenza-related complications as well as persons who live with or care for such persons, including the following: Health care personnel, including all paid and unpaid persons working in health care settings who have the potential for exposure to patients or to infectious materials. These personnel might include but are not limited to physicians, nurses, nursing assistants, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, therapists, technicians, emergency medical service personnel, dental personnel, pharmacists, laboratory personnel, autopsy personnel, students and trainees, contractual staff members, and others not directly involved in patient care but who might be exposed to infectious agents (e.g., clerical, dietary, housekeeping, laundry, security, maintenance, administrative, billing staff, and volunteers). ACIP guidance for vaccination of health care personnel has been published previously (49). Household contacts (including children aged ≥6 months) and caregivers of children aged ≤59 months (<5 years) and adults aged ≥50 years, particularly contacts of children aged <6 months. Household contacts (including children aged ≥6 months) and caregivers of persons with medical conditions that put them at higher risk for severe complications from influenza. Health care personnel and persons who are contacts of persons in these groups (except for of contacts of severely immunocompromised persons who require a protected environment) can receive any influenza vaccine that is otherwise indicated. Persons who care for severely immunocompromised persons requiring a protected environment should not receive LAIV3. ACIP and the Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC) have previously recommended that health care personnel who receive LAIV should avoid providing care for severely immunocompromised persons requiring a protected environment for 7 days after vaccination and that hospital visitors who have received LAIV should avoid contact with such persons for 7 days after vaccination (50). However, such persons need not be restricted from caring for or visiting less severely immunocompromised persons. Children Aged 6 Through 35 Months: Influenza Vaccine Dose Volumes Five IIV3s are approved for children aged ≥6 months (Table 1). Four of these vaccines are egg based (Afluria, Fluarix, FluLaval, and Fluzone), and one is cell culture–based (Flucelvax). For these vaccines, the approved dose volumes for children aged 6 through 35 months are as follows (Table 4): Afluria: 0.25 mL per dose. However, 0.25-mL prefilled syringes are no longer available. For children aged 6 through 35 months, a 0.25-mL dose must be obtained from a multidose vial (51). Fluarix: 0.5 mL per dose (52). Flucelvax: 0.5 mL per dose (53). FluLaval: 0.5 mL per dose (54). Fluzone: Either 0.25 mL or 0.5 mL per dose. Per the package insert, each dose can be given at either volume (55); however, 0.25-mL prefilled syringes are no longer available. For all of these IIV3s, persons aged ≥36 months (≥3 years) should receive 0.5 mL per dose. Alternatively, healthy children aged ≥24 months (≥2 years) can receive LAIV3, 0.2 mL intranasally (0.1 mL in each nostril) (56). LAIV3 is not recommended for certain populations and is not approved for children aged <2 years or adults >49 years (see Contraindications and Precautions for the Use of LAIV3) (Table 2). RIV3 is not approved for children aged <18 years (57). High-dose inactivated influenza vaccine (HD-IIV3) (58) and adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine (aIIV3) (59) are not approved for persons aged <65 years. Care should be taken to administer an age-appropriate vaccine at the appropriate volume for each dose. For IIV3s, the recommended volume can be administered from a prefilled syringe containing the appropriate volume (as supplied by the manufacturer) or a multidose vial. Multidose vials should be used only for the maximum number of doses specified in the package insert. Any vaccine remaining in a vial after the maximum number of doses has been removed should be discarded, regardless of the volume of the doses obtained or any remaining volume in the vial. Children Aged 6 Months Through 8 Years: Number of Influenza Vaccine Doses Children aged 6 months through 8 years require 2 doses of influenza vaccine administered a minimum of 4 weeks apart during their first season of vaccination for optimal protection (60–63). Determination of the number of doses needed is based on 1) the child’s age at the time of the first dose of 2024–25 influenza vaccine and 2) the number of doses of influenza vaccine received in previous influenza seasons. For children aged 6 months through 8 years, the number of doses of influenza vaccine needed for the 2024–25 influenza season is determined as follows (Figure): Those who have previously received ≥2 total doses of trivalent or quadrivalent influenza vaccine ≥4 weeks apart before July 1, 2024, require only 1 dose for the 2024–25 season. The previous 2 doses of influenza vaccine do not need to have been received in the same season or consecutive seasons. Those who have not previously received ≥2 doses of trivalent or quadrivalent influenza vaccine ≥4 weeks apart before July 1, 2024, or whose previous influenza vaccination history is unknown, require 2 doses for the 2024–25 season. The interval between the 2 doses should be ≥4 weeks. Children aged 6 months through 8 years who require 2 doses of influenza vaccine should receive their first dose as soon as possible (including during July and August, if vaccine is available) to allow the second dose (which must be administered ≥4 weeks later) to be received, ideally, by the end of October. For children aged 8 years who require 2 doses of vaccine, both doses should be administered even if the child turns age 9 years between receipt of dose 1 and dose 2. Adults and children aged ≥9 years need only 1 dose of influenza vaccine for the 2024–25 season. Pregnant Persons Pregnant and postpartum persons are at higher risk for severe illness and complications from influenza, particularly during the second and third trimesters. Influenza vaccination during pregnancy is associated with reduced risk for respiratory illness and influenza among pregnant and postpartum persons as well as infants during the first months of life (41–44,64). ACIP and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend that persons who are pregnant or who might be pregnant or postpartum during the influenza season receive influenza vaccine (65). IIV3 or RIV3 can be used. LAIV3 should not be used during pregnancy but can be used postpartum. Influenza vaccine can be administered at any time during pregnancy (i.e., during any trimester), before and during the influenza season. Early vaccination (i.e., during July and August) can be considered for persons who are in the third trimester during these months if vaccine is available because this can provide protection for the infant during the first months of life when they are too young to be vaccinated (41–44,64). Although experience with the use of IIVs during pregnancy is substantial, data specifically reflecting administration of influenza vaccines during the first trimester are limited. Most studies have not noted an association between influenza vaccination and adverse pregnancy outcomes, including spontaneous abortion (miscarriage) (66–76). One observational Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) study conducted during the 2010–11 and 2011–12 seasons noted an association between receipt of IIV containing influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and risk for miscarriage in the 28 days after receipt of IIV, when an H1N1pdm09-containing vaccine also had been received the previous season (77). However, in a larger VSD follow-up study, IIV was not associated with an increased risk for miscarriage during the 2012–13, 2013–14, and 2014–15 seasons, regardless of previous season vaccination (78). There is less experience with the use of more recently licensed influenza vaccines (e.g., cell culture-based and recombinant vaccines) during pregnancy compared with previously available products. For ccIIV, a review of Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) reports from 2013 through 2020 (79) and a prospective cohort study conducted from 2017 through 2020 (80) did not reveal unexpected safety events among pregnant persons. Data from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) conducted at Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment (CISA) Project sites comparing the safety of RIV4 versus IIV4 in 382 pregnant persons supported the safety of RIV4 in pregnancy (https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/122379) (81). Pregnancy registries and surveillance studies exist for certain products, for which information can be found in package inserts. Older Adults ACIP recommends that adults aged ≥65 years preferentially receive any one of the following higher dose or adjuvanted influenza vaccines: high-dose inactivated influenza vaccine (HD-IIV3), recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV3), or adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine (aIIV3). If none of these three vaccines is available at an opportunity for vaccine administration, then any other age-appropriate influenza vaccine should be administered (82,83). Older adults (aged ≥65 years) are at increased risk for severe influenza-associated illness, hospitalization, and death compared with younger persons (4,84,85). Influenza vaccines are often less effective in this population (12). HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV have been evaluated in comparison with nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs in this age group. Two of these vaccines, HD-IIV and RIV, are higher dose vaccines, which contain an increased dose of HA antigen per vaccine virus compared with nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs (60 μg for HD-IIV3 and 45 μg for RIV3, compared with 15 μg for standard-dose inactivated vaccines) (57,58). The adjuvanted vaccine contains 15 μg of HA per virus, similarly to nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs, but contains the adjuvant MF59 (59). HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV have shown relative benefit compared with SD-IIVs in certain studies, with the most evidence available for HD-IIV3. Randomized efficacy studies comparing these vaccines with nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs against laboratory-confirmed influenza outcomes are few in number (86–88) and cover few influenza seasons. Observational studies, predominantly retrospective cohort studies using diagnostic code–defined (rather than laboratory-confirmed) influenza outcomes, are more numerous and include more influenza seasons (89–99). Certain observational studies have reported relative benefit for HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV in comparison with nonadjuvanted SD-IIVs, particularly in prevention of influenza-associated hospitalizations. The size of this relative benefit has varied from season to season and is not observed in all studies in all seasons, making it difficult to generalize the findings to all or most seasons. Studies directly comparing HD-IIV, RIV, and aIIV with one another are few and do not support a conclusion that any one of these vaccines is consistently superior to the others across seasons (89–91,94,100,101). Immunocompromised Persons ACIP recommends that persons with compromised immunity (including but not limited to persons with congenital and acquired immunodeficiency states, persons who are immunocompromised due to medications, and persons with anatomic and functional asplenia) should receive IIV3 or RIV3. All persons should receive an age-appropriate influenza vaccine (i.e., one approved for their age), with the exception that solid organ transplant recipients aged 18 through 64 years who are receiving immunosuppressive medication regimens may receive either HD-IIV3 or aIIV3 as acceptable options (without a preference over other age-appropriate IIV3s or RIV3). ACIP recommends that LAIV3 not be used for immunocompromised persons because of the uncertain but biologically plausible risk for disease attributable to the live vaccine virus. Use of LAIV3 in persons with these and other conditions is discussed in more detail (see Dosage, Administration, Contraindications, and Precautions) (Table 2). Regarding solid organ transplant recipients specifically, a systematic review and meta-analysis including seven studies pertaining to use of higher dose (HD-IIV, double-dose SD-IIV, and RIV) and MF59-adjuvanted influenza vaccines compared with SD-IIV in this population noted no difference in likelihood of influenza-associated hospitalization (GRADE certainty level Low). However, evidence suggested potentially improved immunogenicity, with greater likelihood of seroconversion for both HD-IIV3 and aIIV3 relative to SD-IIV (GRADE certainty level Moderate for HD-IIV3 vs SD-IIV and Low for aIIV3 vs SD-IIV) for the influenza A(H1N1), influenza A(H3N2), and influenza B vaccine components. There was no evidence of increased risk of graft rejection with either HD-IIV3 or aIIV3 relative to SD-IIV (GRADE certainty level Moderate). Only one study included children. No evidence was available for RIV vs SD-IIV (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acipecs/grade/influenza-solid-organ-transplant.html; https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acipecs/grade/influenza-solid-organ-transplant-etr.html). Immunocompromised states comprise a heterogeneous range of conditions with varying risks for severe infections. In many instances, limited data are available regarding the effectiveness of influenza vaccines in the setting of specific immunocompromised states (102). Timing of vaccination might be a consideration (e.g., vaccinating during a period either before or after an immunocompromising intervention). The Infectious Diseases Society of America has published detailed guidance for the selection and timing of vaccines for persons with specific immunocompromising conditions (103). Immune response to influenza vaccines might be blunted in persons with certain conditions, such as congenital immune deficiencies, and in persons receiving cancer chemotherapy, posttransplant regimens, or immunosuppressive medications. Persons with a History of Guillain-Barré Syndrome After Influenza Vaccination A history of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) within 6 weeks of a previous dose of any type of influenza vaccine is considered a precaution for influenza vaccination (Table 2). Persons who are not at higher risk for severe influenza complications (see Populations at Higher Risk for Medical Complications Attributable to Severe Influenza) and who are known to have experienced GBS within 6 weeks of a previous influenza vaccination typically should not be vaccinated. As an alternative to vaccination, providers might consider using influenza antiviral chemoprophylaxis for these persons (104). However, the benefits of influenza vaccination might outweigh the possible risks for certain persons who have a history of GBS within 6 weeks after receipt of influenza vaccine and who also are at higher risk for severe complications from influenza. Persons with a History of Egg Allergy ACIP recommends that all persons aged ≥6 months with egg allergy should receive influenza vaccine. Any influenza vaccine (egg based or nonegg based) that is otherwise appropriate for the recipient’s age and health status can be used (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acipecs/grade/influenza-egg-allergy.html; https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acipecs/grade/influenza-egg-allergy-etr.html). Egg allergy alone necessitates no additional safety measures for influenza vaccination beyond those recommended for any recipient of any vaccine, regardless of severity of previous reaction to egg. All vaccines should be administered in settings in which personnel and equipment needed for rapid recognition and treatment of acute hypersensitivity reactions are available. Most available influenza vaccines, with the exceptions of RIV3 (Flublok, licensed for persons aged ≥18 years) and ccIIV3 (Flucelvax, licensed for persons aged ≥6 months), are prepared by propagation of virus in embryonated eggs and might contain trace amounts of egg proteins, such as ovalbumin. Among those U.S.-licensed influenza vaccines for which ovalbumin content is reported, quantities are generally small (≤1 μg/0.5mL dose) (51,52,54–56,58,59). Reviews of studies of administration of egg-based influenza vaccines to persons with egg allergy have noted no cases of anaphylaxis or serious hypersensitivity reactions (105,106). Severe allergic reactions after administration of the egg-free vaccine RIV to egg-allergic persons have been noted in VAERS reports (107–109). These reports highlight both the possibility that observed reactions after egg-based influenza vaccines might be caused by substances other than egg proteins and the importance of being prepared to recognize and manage serious hypersensitivity reactions when administering any vaccine to any recipient (regardless of allergy history). Severe and life-threatening reactions to vaccines can rarely occur with any vaccine and in any vaccine recipient, regardless of allergy history. Providers are reminded that all vaccines should be administered in settings in which personnel and equipment needed for rapid recognition and treatment of acute hypersensitivity reactions are available. All vaccination providers should be familiar with their office emergency plan and be certified in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (110). No postvaccination observation period is recommended specifically for egg-allergic persons. However, ACIP recommends that vaccination providers consider observing patients (seated or supine) for 15 minutes after administration of any vaccine to decrease the risk for injury should syncope occur (110). Although egg allergy is neither a contraindication nor precaution to the use of any influenza vaccine, there are contraindications and precautions related to allergies to vaccine components other than egg and to previous allergic reactions to influenza vaccines (see Persons with Previous Allergic Reactions to Influenza Vaccines and Dosage, Administration, Contraindications, and Precautions) (Tables 2 and 3). Persons with Previous Allergic Reactions to Influenza Vaccines As is the case for all vaccines, influenza vaccines contain various components that might cause allergic and anaphylactic reactions. Most influenza vaccine package inserts list among contraindications to their use a history of previous severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component of the vaccine or to a previous dose of any influenza vaccine (51,52,54–56,58,59). For ccIIV3 and RIV3, a history of a severe allergic reaction to any vaccine component is listed as a contraindication; no labeled contraindication is specified for a history of allergic reaction to any other influenza vaccine (53,57). However, severe allergic reactions, although rare, can occur after influenza vaccination, even among persons with no previous reactions or known allergies. Vaccine components and excipients can be found in package inserts. However, identifying the causative agent without further evaluation (i.e., through evaluation and testing for specific allergies) can be difficult. Severe allergic reactions after vaccination with RIV have been reported to VAERS, certain of which have occurred among persons reporting previous allergic reactions to egg or to influenza vaccines and that might represent a predisposition to allergic manifestations in affected persons (107–109). Because these rare but severe allergic reactions can occur, ACIP recommends the following for persons with a history of severe allergic reaction to a previous dose of an influenza vaccine (Table 3): For egg-based IIV3s and LAIV3: A history of severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any influenza vaccine (i.e., any egg-based IIV, ccIIV, RIV, or LAIV of any valency) is a contraindication to future receipt of all egg-based IIV3s and LAIV3. Each individual egg-based IIV3 and LAIV3 is also contraindicated for persons who have had a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component of that vaccine (excluding egg; see Persons with a History of Egg Allergy). For ccIIV3: A history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any egg-based IIV, RIV, or LAIV of any valency is a precaution for the use of ccIIV3. If ccIIV3 is administered in such instances, vaccination should occur in an inpatient or outpatient medical setting and should be supervised by a health care provider who is able to recognize and manage severe allergic reactions. Providers also can consider consultation with an allergist to help determine the vaccine component responsible for the allergic reaction. A history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any ccIIV of any valency or to any component of ccIIV3 is a contraindication to future receipt of ccIIV3. For RIV3: A history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any egg-based IIV, ccIIV, or LAIV of any valency is a precaution for the use of RIV3. If RIV3 is administered in such instances, vaccination should occur in an inpatient or outpatient medical setting and should be supervised by a health care provider who is able to recognize and manage severe allergic reactions. Providers can also consider consultation with an allergist to help determine the vaccine component responsible for the allergic reaction. A history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any RIV of any valency or to any component of RIV3 is a contraindication to future receipt of RIV3. Vaccination Issues for Travelers In temperate climate regions of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, influenza activity is seasonal, occurring during approximately October–May in the Northern Hemisphere and April–September in the Southern Hemisphere. In the tropics, influenza might occur throughout the year (111). The timing of influenza activity and predominant types and subtypes of influenza viruses in circulation vary by geographic region (112). Travelers can be exposed to influenza when traveling to an area where influenza is circulating or when traveling as part of large tourist groups (e.g., on cruise ships) that include persons from areas of the world where influenza viruses are circulating (113–116). Travelers who want to reduce their risk for influenza should consider influenza vaccination, preferably at least 2 weeks before departure. In particular, persons who live in the United States and are at higher risk for influenza complications and who were not vaccinated with influenza vaccine during the previous Northern Hemisphere fall or winter should consider receiving influenza vaccination before departure if they plan to travel to the tropics, to the Southern Hemisphere during the Southern Hemisphere influenza season (April–September), or with organized tourist groups or on cruise ships to any location. Persons at higher risk who received the previous season’s influenza vaccine before travel should consult with their health care provider to discuss the risk for influenza and other travel-related diseases before embarking on travel during the summer. All persons (regardless of risk status) who are vaccinated in preparation for travel before the upcoming influenza season’s vaccine is available, or who received the immediately preceding Southern Hemisphere influenza vaccine, should receive the current U.S. seasonal influenza vaccine the following fall or winter. Influenza vaccine formulated for the Southern Hemisphere might differ in viral composition from the Northern Hemisphere vaccine. For persons traveling to the Southern Hemisphere during the Southern Hemisphere influenza season, receipt of a current U.S.-licensed Southern Hemisphere influenza vaccine formulation before departure might be reasonable but might not be feasible because of limited access to or unavailability of Southern Hemisphere formulations in the United States. Most Southern Hemisphere influenza vaccine formulations are not licensed in the United States, and they are typically not commercially available. More information on influenza vaccines and travel is available at https://wwwnc.cdc.govravel/diseases/influenza-seasonal-zoonotic-and-pandemic. Additional information on global influenza surveillance by region is available at https://www.who.intools/flunet. Use of Influenza Antiviral Medications Administration of any IIV3 or RIV3 to persons receiving influenza antiviral medications for treatment or chemoprophylaxis of influenza is acceptable. Data concerning vaccination with LAIV3 in the setting of influenza antiviral use are not available. However, influenza antiviral medications might interfere with the action of LAIV3 because this vaccine contains live influenza viruses. The package insert for LAIV3 notes that influenza antiviral agents might reduce the effectiveness of the vaccine if administered within the interval from 48 hours before to 14 days after vaccination (56). However, the newer influenza antivirals peramivir and baloxavir have longer half-lives than oseltamivir and zanamivir, approximately 20 hours for peramivir (117) and 79 hours for baloxavir (118), and could potentially interfere with the replication of LAIV3, if administered >48 hours before vaccination. Potential interactions between influenza antivirals and LAIV3 have not been studied, and the ideal intervals between administration of these medications and LAIV3 are not known. Assuming a period of at least 5 half-lives for substantial decrease in drug levels (119), a reasonable assumption is that peramivir might interfere with the mechanism of LAIV3 if administered from 5 days before through 2 weeks after vaccination and baloxavir might interfere if administered from 17 days before through 2 weeks after vaccination. The interval between influenza antiviral receipt and LAIV3 during which interference might occur could be further prolonged in the presence of medical conditions that delay medication clearance (e.g., renal insufficiency). Persons who receive these medications during these periods before or after receipt of LAIV3 should be revaccinated with another appropriate influenza vaccine (e.g., IIV3 or RIV3). Administration of Influenza Vaccines with Other Vaccines IIV3s and RIV3 can be administered simultaneously or sequentially with other inactivated vaccines or live vaccines. Injectable vaccines that are given concomitantly should be administered at separate anatomic sites. Vaccines that are administered at the same time as influenza vaccines that might be more likely to be associated with local injection site reactions (e.g., HD-IIV3 and aIIV3) should be given in different limbs, if possible. LAIV3 can be administered simultaneously with other live or inactivated vaccines. However, if two live vaccines are not given simultaneously, at least 4 weeks should pass after administration of one live vaccine (such as LAIV3) before another live vaccine is administered (110). In recent years, multiple vaccines containing nonaluminum adjuvants have been licensed for use in the United States for the prevention of various infectious diseases. Examples include AS01B (in Shingrix, recombinant zoster subunit vaccine [RZV]) (120), AS01E (in Arexvy, respiratory syncytial virus vaccine) (121) MF59 (in Fluad [aIIV3]) (59), and cytosine phosphoguanine oligodeoxynucleotide (in Heplisav-B, recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen vaccine) (122). Data are limited regarding coadministration of these vaccines with other adjuvanted or nonadjuvanted vaccines, including COVID-19 vaccines. Coadministration of RZV with nonadjuvanted IIV4 has been studied, and no evidence of decreased immunogenicity or safety concerns was noted (123). A CISA RCT in persons aged ≥65 years found that the proportion of participants with at least one severe local or systemic reaction was not higher after simultaneous administration of RZV dose 1 and quadrivalent adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine compared with simultaneous administration of RZV dose 1 and quadrivalent high-dose inactivated influenza vaccine (124). Data on the immunogenicity and safety of simultaneous or sequential administration of two nonaluminum adjuvant–containing vaccines are limited, and the ideal interval between such vaccines when given sequentially is not known. In the study of Shingrix and nonadjuvanted IIV4 (123), most reactogenicity symptoms resolved within 4 days. Because of the limited data on the safety of simultaneous administration of two or more vaccines containing nonaluminum adjuvants and the availability of nonadjuvanted influenza vaccine options, selection of a nonadjuvanted influenza vaccine can be considered in situations in which influenza vaccine and another vaccine containing a nonaluminum adjuvant are to be administered concomitantly. However, influenza vaccination should not be delayed if a specific vaccine is not available. As recommended for all vaccines, vaccines with nonaluminum adjuvants should be administered at separate anatomic sites from other vaccines that are given concomitantly (110). For more recently introduced and new vaccines, data informing simultaneous administration with influenza vaccines might be limited or evolving. Providers should consult current CDC/ACIP recommendations and guidance for up-to-date information. Top Influenza Vaccine Composition and Available Vaccines Influenza Vaccine Composition for the 2024–25 Season All influenza vaccines licensed in the United States will contain components derived from influenza viruses antigenically similar to those recommended by FDA (https://www.fda.gov/advisory-committees/advisory-committee-calendar/vaccines-and-related-biological-products-advisory-committee-march-5-2024-meeting-announcement) (125). All influenza vaccines expected to be available in the United States for the 2024–25 season will be trivalent vaccines. For the 2024–25 season, U.S. egg-based influenza vaccines (i.e., vaccines other than ccIIV3 and RIV3) will contain HA derived from an influenza A/Victoria/4897/2022 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus, an influenza A/Thailand/8/2022 (H3N2)-like virus, and an influenza B/Austria/1359417/2021 (Victoria lineage)-like virus. For the 2024–25 season, U.S. cell culture–based inactivated (ccIIV3) and recombinant (RIV3) influenza vaccines will contain HA derived from an influenza A/Wisconsin/67/2022 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus, an influenza A/Massachusetts/18/2022 (H3N2)-like virus, and an influenza B/Austria/1359417/2021 (Victoria lineage)-like virus Vaccines Available for the 2024–25 Season Availability of specific types and brands of licensed seasonal influenza vaccines in the United States is determined by the manufacturers of the vaccines. Information presented concerning vaccines expected to be available and their approved indications and usage reflects current knowledge and is subject to change. Various influenza vaccines will be available for the 2024–25 season (Table 1). For many vaccine recipients, more than one type or brand of vaccine might be appropriate within approved indications and ACIP recommendations. Current prescribing information and ACIP recommendations should be consulted for up-to-date information. Contraindications and precautions for the different types of influenza vaccines are summarized (Tables 2 and 3), as are dose volumes (Table 4). Not all influenza vaccines are likely to be uniformly available in any specific practice setting or geographic locality. Vaccination should not be delayed to obtain a specific product when an appropriate one is available. Within these guidelines and approved indications, ACIP makes no preferential recommendation for the use of any one influenza vaccine over another when more than one licensed and recommended vaccine is available, except for selection of influenza vaccines for persons aged ≥65 years (see Older Adults). Dosage, Administration, Contraindications, and Precautions Trivalent Inactivated Influenza Vaccines (IIV3s) Available Vaccines. As in recent seasons, various inactivated influenza vaccines (IIVs) are expected to be available for 2024–25 (Table 1); all are expected to be trivalent (IIV3s). Standard-dose, nonadjuvanted IIV3s are licensed for persons aged as young as 6 months. However, for certain IIV3s, the approved dose volume for children aged 6 through 35 months differs from that for older children and adults (Table 4). Care should be taken to administer the appropriate dose volume. Two IIV3s, the MF59-adjuvanted IIV3 Fluad (aIIV3) and the high-dose IIV3 Fluzone High-Dose (HD-IIV3), are approved only for persons aged ≥65 years, but are acceptable options for solid organ transplant recipients aged 18 through 64 years who are receiving immunosuppressive medication regimens, without a preference over other age-appropriate IIV3s or RIV3. Standard-dose, nonadjuvanted IIV3s contain 15 μg of HA per vaccine virus in a 0.5-mL dose (7.5 μg of HA per vaccine virus in a 0.25-mL dose). For 2024–25, this category is expected to include five different vaccines (Table 1). Four of these are egg-based vaccines (Afluria, Fluarix, FluLaval, and Fluzone), and one is a cell culture–based vaccine (Flucelvax [ccIIV3]). All are approved for persons aged ≥6 months. Egg-based and cell culture–based vaccines differ in the substrate in which reference vaccine viruses supplied to the manufacturer are propagated in quantities sufficient to produce the needed number of doses of vaccine. For the IIV3s Afluria (51), Fluarix (52), FluLaval (54), and Fluzone (55), reference vaccine viruses are propagated in eggs. For Flucelvax (ccIIV3), reference vaccine viruses are propagated in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells instead of eggs (53). Two additional IIV3s that will be available for the 2024–25 season are approved only for persons aged ≥65 years. These vaccines are egg based. Trivalent high-dose inactivated influenza vaccine (Fluzone High-Dose; HD-IIV3) contains 60 μg of HA per vaccine virus (180 μg total) in a 0.5-mL dose (58). Trivalent adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine (Fluad; aIIV3) contains 15 μg of HA per vaccine virus (45 μg total) and MF59 adjuvant (59). Dosage and Administration. Standard-dose nonadjuvanted IIV3s are approved for children aged as young as 6 months. Certain of these IIV3s are approved at different dose volumes for very young children than for older children and adults. Care should be taken to administer the correct dose volume for each needed dose (see Children Aged 6 Through 35 Months: Influenza Vaccine Dose Volumes) (Tables 1 and 4): Afluria: The approved dose volume for children aged 6 through 35 months is 0.25 mL per dose. Persons aged ≥36 months (≥3 years) should receive 0.5 mL per dose (51). Fluarix: The approved dose volume is 0.5 mL per dose for all persons aged ≥6 months (52). Flucelvax: The approved dose volume is 0.5 mL per dose for all persons aged ≥6 months (53). FluLaval: The approved dose volume is 0.5 mL per dose for all persons aged ≥6 months (54). Fluzone: The approved dose volume for children aged 6 through 35 months is either 0.25 mL or 0.5 mL per dose. Persons aged ≥36 months (≥3 years) should receive 0.5 mL per dose (55). If prefilled syringes are not available, the appropriate volume can be administered from a multidose vial. Of note, dose volume is distinct from the number of doses. Children in this age group who require 2 doses for 2024–25 need 2 separate doses administered ≥4 weeks apart, regardless of the specific IIV3 used and volume given for each dose (see Children Aged 6 Months Through 8 Years: Number of Influenza Vaccine Doses) (Figure). For children aged 36 months (3 years) through 17 years and adults aged ≥18 years, the dose volume for all IIV3s is 0.5 mL per dose. If a smaller vaccine dose (e.g., 0.25 mL) is inadvertently administered to a person aged ≥36 months, the remaining volume needed to make a full dose should be administered during the same vaccination visit or, if measuring the needed remaining volume is a challenge, administering a repeat dose at the full volume is acceptable. If the error is discovered later (after the recipient has left the vaccination setting), a full dose should be administered as soon as the recipient can return. Vaccination with a formulation approved for adult use should be counted as a single dose if inadvertently administered to a child. IIV3s are administered intramuscularly (IM). For adults and older children, the deltoid muscle is the preferred site. Infants and younger children should be vaccinated in the anterolateral thigh. Additional specific guidance regarding site selection and needle length for IM injection is provided in the General Best Practice Guidelines for Immunization (110). One IIV3, Afluria, is licensed for IM injection via the PharmaJet Stratis jet injector for persons aged 18 through 64 years (51). Persons in this age group can receive Afluria via either needle and syringe or this specific jet injection device. Children aged 6 months through 17 years and adults aged ≥65 years should receive this vaccine by needle and syringe only. No other IIV3s are licensed for administration by jet injector. Contraindications and Precautions for the Use of IIV3s. Manufacturer package inserts and updated CDC and ACIP guidance should be consulted for information on contraindications and precautions for individual influenza vaccines. Each IIV3, whether egg based or cell culture based, has a labeled contraindication for persons with a history of a severe allergic reaction to any component of that vaccine (Tables 2 and 3). However, although egg is a component of all IIV3s other than ccIIV3, ACIP makes specific recommendations for the use of influenza vaccine for persons with egg allergy (see Persons with a History of Egg Allergy). All egg-based IIV3s are contraindicated in persons who have had a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to a previous dose of any influenza vaccine (any egg-based IIV, ccIIV, RIV, or LAIV of any valency). Use of ccIIV3 is contraindicated in persons who have had a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any ccIIV of any valency. A history of severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any other influenza vaccine (i.e., any egg-based IIV, RIV, or LAIV of any valency) is a precaution for the use of ccIIV3 (see Persons with Previous Allergic Reactions to Influenza Vaccines) (Tables 2 and 3). If ccIIV3 is administered in such an instance, vaccination should occur in an inpatient or outpatient medical setting and should be supervised by a health care provider who is able to recognize and manage severe allergic reactions. Providers can also consider consultation with an allergist to help identify the vaccine component responsible for the reaction. Information about vaccine components can be found in the package inserts for each vaccine. Prophylactic use of antiviral agents is an option that can be considered for preventing influenza among persons who cannot receive vaccine, particularly for those who are at higher risk for medical complications attributable to severe influenza (104). Moderate or severe acute illness with or without fever is a general precaution for vaccination (110). A history of GBS within 6 weeks after receipt of a previous dose of influenza vaccine is considered a precaution for the use of all influenza vaccines (Table 2). Trivalent Recombinant Influenza Vaccine (RIV3) Available Vaccine. One recombinant influenza vaccine, Flublok (RIV3), is expected to be available during the 2024–25 influenza season. RIV3 is approved for persons aged ≥18 years. This vaccine contains recombinant HA produced in an insect cell line using genetic sequences from cell-derived influenza viruses and is manufactured without the use of influenza viruses or eggs (57). Dosage and Administration. RIV3 is administered by IM injection via needle and syringe. A 0.5-mL dose contains 45 μg of HA derived from each vaccine virus (135 μg total). Contraindications and Precautions for the Use of RIV3. Manufacturer package inserts and updated CDC and ACIP guidance should be consulted for information on contraindications and precautions for individual influenza vaccines. RIV3 is contraindicated in persons who have had a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to a previous dose of any RIV of any valency or to any component of RIV3. A history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any other influenza vaccine (i.e., any egg-based IIV, ccIIV, or LAIV of any valency) is a precaution for the use of RIV3. If RIV3 is administered in such an instance, vaccination should occur in an inpatient or outpatient medical setting and should be supervised by a health care provider who is able to recognize and manage severe allergic reactions. Providers can also consider consulting with an allergist to help identify the vaccine component responsible for the reaction (Tables 2 and 3). Moderate or severe acute illness with or without fever is a general precaution for vaccination (110). A history of GBS within 6 weeks after receipt of a previous dose of influenza vaccine is considered a precaution for the use of all influenza vaccines (Table 2). RIV3 is not approved for children aged <18 years. Trivalent Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV3) Available Vaccine. One live attenuated influenza vaccine, FluMist (LAIV3), is expected to be available during the 2024–25 influenza season. LAIV3 is approved for persons aged 2 through 49 years. LAIV3 contains live attenuated influenza viruses that are propagated in eggs. These viruses are cold adapted (so that they replicate efficiently at 25°C [77°F]) and temperature sensitive (so that their replication is restricted at higher temperatures, 39°C [102.2°F] for influenza A viruses and 37°C [98.6°] for influenza B viruses). The live attenuated vaccine viruses replicate in the nasopharynx, which is necessary to promote an immune response (56). No preference is expressed for LAIV3 versus other influenza vaccines used within specified indications. Dosage and Administration. LAIV3 is administered intranasally using the supplied prefilled, single-use sprayer containing 0.2 mL of vaccine. Approximately 0.1 mL (i.e., one half of the total sprayer contents) is sprayed into the first nostril while the recipient is in the upright position. An attached dose-divider clip is removed from the sprayer to permit administration of the second half of the dose into the other nostril. Sniffing of the dose is not necessary. If the recipient sneezes immediately after administration, the dose should not be repeated. However, if nasal congestion is present that might impede delivery of the vaccine to the nasopharyngeal mucosa, deferral of administration should be considered until resolution of the illness, or another appropriate vaccine should be administered instead. Each total dose of 0.2 mL contains 106.5–7.5 fluorescent focus units of each vaccine virus (56). Contraindications and Precautions for the Use of LAIV3. Manufacturer package inserts and updated CDC and ACIP guidance should be consulted for information on contraindications and precautions for individual influenza vaccines. Conditions considered by ACIP to be contraindications and precautions for the use of LAIV3 are summarized (Table 2). These include two labeled contraindications that appear in the package insert (56) and other conditions for which there is either uncertain but biologically plausible potential risk associated with live viruses or limited data for use of LAIV. Contraindications to use of LAIV3 include the following (Tables 2 and 3): Severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component of the vaccine or to a previous dose of any influenza vaccine (i.e., any egg-based IIV, ccIIV, RIV, or LAIV of any valency; a labeled contraindication noted in the package insert). However, although egg is a component of LAIV3, ACIP makes specific recommendations for the use of influenza vaccine for persons with egg allergy (see Persons with a History of Egg Allergy). Children and adolescents receiving concomitant aspirin- or salicylate-containing medications, because of the potential risk for Reye syndrome (a labeled contraindication noted in the package insert). Children aged 2 through 4 years who have received a diagnosis of asthma or whose parents or caregivers report that a health care provider has told them during the preceding 12 months that their child had wheezing or asthma or whose medical record indicates a wheezing episode has occurred during the preceding 12 months. Children and adults who are immunocompromised due to any cause, including but not limited to immunosuppression caused by medications, congenital or acquired immunodeficiency states, HIV infection, anatomic asplenia, or functional asplenia (such as that due to sickle cell anemia). Close contacts and caregivers of severely immunosuppressed persons who require a protected environment. Pregnancy. Persons with active communication between the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the oropharynx, nasopharynx, nose, or ear or any other cranial CSF leak. Persons with cochlear implants, because of the potential for CSF leak that might exist for a period after implantation (providers might consider consultation with a specialist concerning the risk for persistent CSF leak if an inactivated or recombinant vaccine cannot be used). Receipt of influenza antiviral medication within the previous 48 hours for oseltamivir and zanamivir, previous 5 days for peramivir, and previous 17 days for baloxavir. The interval between influenza antiviral receipt and LAIV3 during which interference might potentially occur might be further prolonged in the presence of medical conditions that delay medication clearance (e.g., renal insufficiency). Precautions to the use of LAIV3 include the following (Tables 2 and 3): Moderate or severe acute illness with or without fever. History of GBS within 6 weeks after receipt of any influenza vaccine. Asthma in persons aged ≥5 years. Other underlying medical condition (other than those listed under contraindications) that might predispose to complications after wild-type influenza virus infection (e.g., chronic pulmonary, cardiovascular [except isolated hypertension], renal, hepatic, neurologic, hematologic, or metabolic disorders [including diabetes mellitus]). Top Storage and Handling of Influenza Vaccines In all instances, approved manufacturer packaging information should be consulted for authoritative guidance concerning storage and handling of specific influenza vaccines. Typically, influenza vaccines should be protected from light and stored at temperatures that are recommended in the package insert. Recommended storage temperatures are typically 36°F–46°F (2°C–8°C) and should be maintained at all times with adequate refrigeration and temperature monitoring. Vaccine that has frozen should be discarded. Specific recommendations for appropriate refrigerators and temperature monitoring equipment can be found in the Vaccine Storage and Handling Toolkit, available at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/storage-handling/?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/admin/storageoolkit/index.html. Vaccines should not be used beyond the expiration date on the label. In addition to the expiration date, multidose vials also might have a beyond-use date (BUD), which specifies the number of days the vaccine can be kept once first accessed. After being accessed for the first dose, multidose vials should not be used after the BUD. If no BUD is provided, then the listed expiration date is to be used. Multidose vials should be returned to recommended storage conditions between uses. Package information might also specify a maximum number of doses contained in multidose vials (regardless of remaining volume). No more than the specified number of doses should be removed, and any remainder should be discarded. Providers should contact the manufacturer for information on permissible temperature excursions and other departures from recommended storage and handling conditions that are not discussed in the package labeling. Top Additional Sources of Information Regarding Influenza and Influenza Vaccines Influenza Surveillance, Prevention, and Control Updated information regarding influenza surveillance, detection, prevention, and control is available at https://www.cdc.gov/flu. U.S. surveillance data are updated weekly throughout the year on FluView (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly) and can be viewed in FluView Interactive (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/fluviewinteractive.htm). In addition, periodic updates regarding influenza are published in MMWR (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/index.html). Additional information regarding influenza and influenza vaccines can be obtained from CDCINFO by calling 1–800–232–4636. State and local health departments should be consulted about availability of influenza vaccines, access to vaccination programs, information related to state or local influenza activity, reporting of influenza outbreaks and influenza-related pediatric deaths, and advice concerning outbreak control. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 requires health care providers to report any adverse event listed by the vaccine manufacturer as a contraindication to future doses of the vaccine or any adverse event listed in the VAERS Table of Reportable Events Following Vaccination (https://vaers.hhs.gov/docs/VAERS_Table_of_Reportable_Events_Following_Vaccination.pdf) that occurs within the specified period after vaccination. In addition to mandated reporting, health care providers are encouraged to report any clinically significant adverse event after vaccination to VAERS. Information on how to report a vaccine adverse event is available at https://vaers.hhs.gov/index.html. National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP), established by the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986, as amended, is a no-fault alternative to the traditional tort system. It provides compensation to persons found to be injured by certain vaccines. VICP covers most vaccines routinely given in the United States. The Vaccine Injury Table (https://www.hrsa.gov/sites/default/files/hrsa/vicp/vaccine-injury-table-01-03-2022.pdf) lists the vaccines covered by VICP and the associated injuries and conditions that might receive a legal presumption of causation. If the injury or condition is not in the table or does not meet the requirements in the table, persons must prove that the vaccine caused the injury or condition. Claims must be filed within specified time frames. Persons of all ages who receive a VICP-covered vaccine might be eligible to file a claim.

Top1Influenza Division, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, CDC; 2Immunization Safety Office, National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, CDC; 3Jamie Loehr, MD, Cayuga Family Medicine, Ithaca, New York Top Disclosure of Relationship and Unlabeled Use All authors have completed and submitted the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors form for the disclosure of potential conflicts of interest. No potential conflicts of interest were disclosed. This report includes discussion of the unlabeled use of influenza vaccines in the recommendations for persons with a history of egg allergy and for solid organ transplant recipients aged 18 through 64 years. With regard to persons with a history of egg allergy, history of severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to the vaccine or any of its components (which include egg for certain vaccines) is a labeled contraindication to receipt of most IIV3s and LAIV3. However, ACIP recommends that all persons aged ≥6 months with egg allergy should receive influenza vaccine. Any influenza vaccine (egg based or nonegg based) that is otherwise appropriate for the recipient’s age and health status can be used. With regard to solid organ transplant recipients aged 18 through 64 years, the high-dose inactivated influenza vaccine (HD-IIV3) and adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine (aIIV3) are approved for persons aged ≥65 years. However, ACIP recommends that solid organ transplant recipients aged 18 through 64 years who are receiving immunosuppressive medication regimens may receive either HD-IIV3 or aIIV3 as acceptable options, without a preference over other age-appropriate IIV3s or RIV3. Top CDC Adoption of ACIP Recommendations for MMWR Recommendations and Reports, MMWR Policy Notes, and Immunization Schedules (Child/Adolescent, Adult) Recommendations for routine use of vaccines in children, adolescents, and adults are developed by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). ACIP is chartered as a Federal Advisory Committee to provide expert external advice and guidance to the Director of CDC on use of vaccines and related agents for the control of vaccine preventable diseases in the civilian population of the United States. Recommendations for routine use of vaccines in children and adolescents are harmonized to the greatest extent possible with recommendations made by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), the American College of Nurse-Midwives (ACNM), the American Academy of Physician Associates (AAPA), and the National Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners (NAPNAP). Recommendations for routine use of vaccinations in adults are harmonized with recommendations of AAFP, ACOG, ACNM, AAPA, the American College of Physicians (ACP), the American Pharmacists Association (APhA), and the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA). ACIP recommendations are forwarded to CDC’s Director and once adopted become official CDC policy. These recommendations are then published in CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR).

Availability and characteristics of specific products and presentations might change or differ from what is described in this table and in the text of this report. † Although a history of severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to egg is a labeled contraindication to the use of egg-based IIV3s and LAIV3, ACIP recommends that all persons aged ≥6 months with egg allergy should receive influenza vaccine and that any influenza vaccine (egg based or nonegg based) that is otherwise appropriate for the recipient’s age and health status can be used (see Persons with a History of Egg Allergy). § The approved dose volume for Afluria is 0.25 mL for children aged 6 through 35 months and 0.5 mL for persons aged ≥3 years. However, 0.25-mL prefilled syringes are no longer available. For children aged 6 through 35 months, a 0.25-mL dose must be obtained from a multidose vial. ¶ IM-administered influenza vaccines should be administered by needle and syringe only, except for the MDV presentation of Afluria, which can alternatively be given by the PharmaJet Stratis jet injector for persons aged 18 through 64 years only. For older children and adults, the recommended site for IM influenza vaccination is the deltoid muscle. The preferred site for infants and young children is the anterolateral aspect of the thigh. Additional specific guidance regarding site selection and needle length for IM administration is available in the General Best Practice Guidelines for Immunization available at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/general-recs/index.html. ** Not applicable. †† Fluzone is approved for children aged 6 through 35 months at either 0.25 mL or 0.5 mL per dose; however, 0.25-mL prefilled syringes are no longer available. If a prefilled syringe of Fluzone is used for a child in this age group, the dose volume will be 0.5 mL per dose. Top TABLE 2.

When a contraindication is present, a vaccine should not be administered. When a precaution is present, vaccination should generally be deferred but might be indicated if the benefit of protection from the vaccine outweighs the risk for an adverse reaction (see the General Best Practice Guidelines for Immunization, available at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/general-recs/index.html). Package inserts for U.S.-licensed vaccines are available at https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/vaccines/vaccines-licensed-use-united-states. † Although a history of severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to egg is a labeled contraindication to the use of egg-based IIV3s and LAIV3, ACIP recommends that all persons aged ≥6 months with egg allergy should receive influenza vaccine, and that any influenza vaccine (egg based or nonegg based) that is otherwise appropriate for the recipient’s age and health status can be used (see Persons with a History of Egg Allergy). § Labeled contraindication noted in package insert. ¶ If administered, vaccination should occur in a medical setting and should be supervised by a health care provider who can recognize and manage severe allergic reactions. Providers can consider consultation with an allergist in such cases to assist in identification of the component responsible for the allergic reaction. ** Injectable vaccines are recommended for persons with cochlear implant because of the potential for CSF leak, which might exist for a period after implantation. Providers might consider consultation with a specialist concerning risk for persistent CSF leak if an inactivated or recombinant vaccine cannot be used. †† Use of LAIV3 in context of influenza antivirals has not been studied; however, interference with activity of LAIV3 is biologically plausible, and this possibility is noted in the package insert for LAIV3. In the absence of data supporting an adequate minimum interval between influenza antiviral use and LAIV3 administration, the intervals provided are based on the half-life of each antiviral. The interval between influenza antiviral receipt and LAIV3 for which interference might potentially occur might be further prolonged in the presence of medical conditions that delay medication clearance (e.g., renal insufficiency). Influenza antivirals might also interfere with LAIV3 if initiated within 2 weeks after vaccination. Persons who receive antivirals during the period starting with the specified time before receipt of LAIV3 through 2 weeks after receipt of LAIV3 should be revaccinated with an age-appropriate IIV3 or RIV3.

General best practice guidelines for immunization; https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/general-recs/index.html). In addition to the contraindications based on history of severe allergic reaction to influenza vaccines that are noted in the table, each individual influenza vaccine is contraindicated for persons who have had a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component of that vaccine. Vaccine components can be found in package inserts. Although a history of severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to egg is a labeled contraindication to the use of egg-based IIV3s and LAIV3, ACIP recommends that all persons aged ≥6 months with egg allergy should receive influenza vaccine, and that any influenza vaccine (egg based or nonegg based) that is otherwise appropriate for the recipient’s age and health status can be used (see Persons with a History of Egg Allergy). § When a precaution is present, vaccination should generally be deferred but might be indicated if the benefit of protection from the vaccine outweighs the risk for an adverse reaction, consistent with the General Best Practice Guidelines for Immunization (Source: Kroger A, Bahta L, Long S, Sanchez P. General best practice guidelines for immunization; https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/general-recs/index.html). Providers can consider using the following vaccines in these instances; however, vaccination should occur in an inpatient or outpatient medical setting with supervision by a health care provider who is able to recognize and manage severe allergic reactions: 1) for persons with a history of severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any egg-based IIV or LAIV of any valency, the provider can consider administering ccIIV3 or RIV3; 2) for persons with a history of severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any ccIIV of any valency, the provider can consider administering RIV3; and 3) for persons with a history of severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any RIV of any valency, the provider can consider administering ccIIV3. Providers can also consider consulting with an allergist to help determine which vaccine component is responsible for the allergic reaction. TopBOX. Abbreviation conventions for influenza vaccines discussed in this report. Main influenza vaccine types: IIV = inactivated influenza vaccine RIV = recombinant influenza vaccine LAIV = live attenuated influenza vaccine Numerals following letter abbreviations indicate valency (the number of influenza virus hemagglutinin antigens represented in the vaccine): 3 for trivalent vaccines: one A(H1N1), one A(H3N2), and one B virus (from one lineage) 4 for quadrivalent vaccines: one A(H1N1), one A(H3N2), and two B viruses (one from each lineage) All influenza vaccines expected to be available in the United States for the 2024–25 season are trivalent vaccines. However, abbreviations for quadrivalent vaccines (e.g., IIV4) might be used in this report when discussing information specific to quadrivalent vaccines Abbreviations for general vaccine categories (e.g., IIV) might be used when discussing information that is not specific to valency or to a specific vaccine in that category. Prefixes are used when necessary to refer to certain specific IIVs: a for MF59-adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine (e.g., aIIV3) cc for cell culture–based inactivated influenza vaccine (e.g., ccIIV3) HD for high-dose inactivated influenza vaccine (e.g., HD-IIV3) SD for standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccine (e.g., SD-IIV3) Top FIGURE. Influenza vaccine dosing algorithm for children aged 6 months through 8 years* — Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, United States, 2024–25 influenza season. * Children aged 6 months through 8 years who require 2 doses of influenza vaccine should receive their first dose as soon as possible (including during July and August, if vaccine is available) to allow the second dose (which must be administered ≥4 weeks later) to be received, ideally, by the end of October.

Opens in a new tab or window email article Although antivirals had some positive effects on the treatment of severe influenza and prevention of the flu, many effects on outcomes were uncertain, according to two World Health Organization-funded systematic reviews and network meta-analyses. In the first analysis, treatment of severe influenza with oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and peramivir (Rapivab) appeared to reduce the length of hospital stays, but overall the effects of antivirals on key clinical outcomes -- such as mortality -- remained questionable, reported Qiukui Hao, MD, of McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, and colleagues in The Lancet. Another analysis from Hao and colleagues found that post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) with a range of antivirals probably decreased risk of severe disease in high-risk individuals after exposure to seasonal influenza viruses and may have also reduced the risk of zoonotic infection after exposure to novel influenza A viruses, Hao and researchers reported. "The optimal antiviral drugs for treatment of severe influenza and post-exposure prophylaxis for influenza are unclear," David Hui, MD, of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, wrote in an accompanying editorial. "Many knowledge gaps remain that need to be filled." Treatment of Severe Flu In the first systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials, Hao and colleagues analyzed eight trials that included a total of 1,424 participants. Researchers found only low certainty of evidence that duration of hospitalization for seasonal flu was reduced with oseltamivir and peramivir when compared with standard care or placebo, although statistically significant with a mean reduction in hospitalization of 1.63 and 1.73 days for the two drugs, respectively. There was no significant difference in time to symptom alleviation with either drug, although again with low certainty of evidence. Researchers were unable to draw any other conclusions about the use of antivirals and key patient outcomes. For example, in a network meta-analysis of mortality that included four trials of oseltamivir, peramivir, or zanamivir (Relenza) for the treatment of severe seasonal influenza, the impact on mortality varied from a reduction of 18 per 1,000 patients to an increase of four per 1,000 patients for seasonal influenza when compared with standard care or placebo. Mortality also varied from 232 fewer to 51 more per 1,000 patients infected with zoonotic influenza A viruses. The evidence for both findings was of very low certainty. "Great uncertainty remains regarding the effects of oseltamivir, peramivir, and zanamivir on mortality in patients with severe seasonal influenza or zoonotic influenza," Hao and colleagues wrote. The study had several limitations, the authors acknowledged. There were only eight trials in the analysis, and none looked at effects of antivirals versus placebo or standard care on any adverse events or severe adverse events, making it impossible to draw any firm conclusions about most outcomes for patients with severe influenza. Also, data were scarce on the effects of antivirals on patients over the age of 60, nor was there enough data to perform prespecified subgroup analyses. Flu PEP? In this systematic review, researchers analyzed 33 trials that evaluated the efficacy and safety of six antivirals for the prevention of influenza: zanamivir, oseltamivir, baloxavir (Xofluza), amantadine (Symmetrel), rimantadine (Flumadine), and laninamivir (never approved in the U.S.). In 19 trials that reported on laboratory-confirmed seasonal asymptomatic infections, zanamivir, oseltamivir, laninamivir, and baloxavir probably reduced symptomatic influenza in high-risk individuals when given within 48 hours after exposure to seasonal influenza. The four antivirals had similar, statistically significant risk reductions of 0.35 to 0.43 when compared with placebo. However, the antivirals fell below the threshold of importance for reducing symptomatic influenza in people at low risk for severe disease. Rimantadine did not significantly reduce risk for symptomatic influenza A virus infection; no data was available for amantadine. Of note, researchers found that when given promptly after exposure, zanamivir, oseltamivir, laninamivir, and baloxavir might reduce the development of symptomatic infection from exposure to novel zoonotic influenza A viruses that are often associated with severe disease in people. According to the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), PEP is only recommended for severely immunocompromised asymptomatic adults and children ages 3 months or older who are at very high risk of developing complications from influenza and for whom influenza vaccination is contraindicated or unavailable after household exposure to influenza. Also, the CDC now recommends PEP with oseltamivir in people exposed to novel influenza A viruses, including H5N1 (bird flu). Hao and colleagues also found that in studies evaluating both asymptomatic and symptomatic illness, oseltamivir, laninamivir, baloxavir, and amantadine probably decreased the risk of all influenza infection. Results were driven by reduction of symptomatic influenza. "Antivirals probably have little or no effect on prevention of asymptomatic influenza virus infection," the researchers concluded. The findings of the analysis "support the use of baloxavir, laninamivir, oseltamivir, or zanamivir for post-exposure prophylaxis of seasonal influenza in people at high risk of severe influenza, and they also provide some indirect support for the use of these antivirals for post-exposure prophylaxis of zoonotic influenza," Hui wrote in his editorial. However, four of the 33 trials looked at the effects of oseltamivir administered as PEP and found it had little to no effect on preventing hospital admission from seasonal influenza. In addition, 15 studies provided evidence that zanamivir, oseltamivir, laninamivir, and baloxavir as PEP probably had little to no effect on all-cause mortality. Absolute risk reductions ranged from zero fewer deaths to one more per 1,000 patients. On one reassuring note, in an analysis of 13 trials that reported adverse drug-related events, zanamivir, laninamivir, and rimantadine appeared to result in few drug-related adverse events, with risk ratios ranging from 1.01 to 1.40. Baloxavir also appeared to have little or no effect on drug-related adverse events. Hao and researchers acknowledged several limitations of this analysis, including lack of outcomes data on length of hospitalization, ICU admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, and disease severity. Also the mean age of participants varied widely, from about 7 years to over age 81 years. There were few data on pregnant individuals or young infants. Studies also varied in terms of drug administration, dosage, and duration of PEP. Katherine Kahn is a staff writer at MedPage Today, covering the infectious diseases beat.

Epidemiological studies have confirmed the co-circulation of these viruses in pig herds, making swIAV-PRRSV co-infections expected. A couple of in vivo co-infection studies have reported replication interferences between these two viruses. Herein, using a reductionist in vitro model, we investigated the potential mechanisms of these in vivo interferences. We first examined the impact of swIAV on porcine alveolar macrophages (AMs) and its effects on AMs co-infection by PRRSV. This was done either in monoculture or in co-culture with respiratory tracheal epithelial cells to represent the complexity of the interactions between the viruses and their respective target cells (epithelial cells for swIAV and AMs for PRRSV). AMs were obtained either from conventional or specific pathogen-free (SPF) pigs. SwIAV replication was abortive in AMs, inducing cell death at high multiplicity of infections. In AMs from three out of four conventional animals, swIAV showed no impact on PRRSV replication. However, inhibition of PRRSV multiplication was observed in AMs from one animal, accompanied by an early increase in the expression of interferon (IFN)-I and IFN-stimulated genes. In AMs from six SPF pigs, swIAV inhibited PRRSV replication in all animals, with an early induction of antiviral genes. Co-culture experiments involving tracheal epithelial cells and AMs from either SPF or conventional pigs all showed swIAV-induced inhibition of PRRSV replication, together with early induction of antiviral genes. These findings highlight the complex interactions between swIAV and PRRSV in porcine AMs, and would suggest a role of host factors, such as sanitary status, in modulating viral propagation. Our co-culture experiments demonstrated that swIAV inhibits PRRSV replication more effectively in the presence of respiratory tracheal epithelial cells, suggesting a synergistic antiviral response between AMs and epithelial cells, consistent with in vivo experiments. 1 Introduction Porcine Respiratory Disease Complex (PRDC) is a multifactorial syndrome that leads to substantial losses in the swine industry (1, 2). It is caused by the association of various pathogens, including viruses and bacteria, which can persist in the host and circulate simultaneously within a herd. Common agents causing PRDC include swine influenza A virus (swIAV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), and Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (Mhp). Epidemiological studies have identified a noteworthy association between porcine swIAV and PRRSV, underlining the importance of investigating their interactions (1, 3–6). PRRSV, classified as a member of the Arteriviridae family within the Nidovirales order, is an enveloped virus with a positive-single-stranded RNA genome. PRRSV is categorized into two distinct species: Betaarterivirus suid 1 (PRRSV-1), primarily found in Europe, and Betaarterivirus suid 2 (PRRSV-2), mostly prevalent in North America and Asia (7, 8). The virus induces long-term infections characterized by interference with type I interferon induction (9–13). Swine IAV belongs to the genus Alphainfluenzavirus within the Orthomyxoviridae family. It is an enveloped virus with a negative-single-stranded, segmented RNA genome. The most commonly observed subtypes of influenza A viruses in pigs worldwide are H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2 (14). Unlike PRRSV, swIAV leads to acute respiratory disease and the induction of high levels of type I interferon (15–17). Given the worldwide prevalence of both PRRSV and swIAV in the large majority of swine rearing regions, there is a significant risk of simultaneous infections in pig herds. Therefore, investigating the interaction between these two viruses is important for a comprehensive understanding of PRDC. Macrophages play an essential role in the initial defense against respiratory infections through their functions of phagocytosis and professional antigen-presenting cells. They also contribute to homeostasis by clearing apoptotic cells, secreting tissue repair factors, and participating in tissue remodeling (18, 19). PRRSV infects cells from the monocyte lineage, with porcine alveolar macrophages (AMs) considered to be the main target cells (15). During PRRSV infection, the virus alters AMs function by disrupting cytokine production and inducing apoptosis (15, 20). SwIAV preferentially replicates in the epithelial cells of pig respiratory tracts, but AMs may also be susceptible to the virus (21–23). Regarding the impact of swIAV on AMs, studies have primarily focused on the virus’ ability to replicate within these cells. It is recognized that influenza A virus (IAV) replication in macrophages is influenced by both the viral strain and the type of macrophages. The most compelling evidence of IAV replication in macrophages has been demonstrated in macrophages from mice and humans, originating from studies focusing on the highly pathogenic avian H5N1 virus (24–26). However, further research is needed to better understand the interactions between other swIAV (which are not highly pathogenic) and AMs in pigs, particularly as swIAV infections are frequently associated with other respiratory pathogens. SwIAV and PRRSV co-infections have been studied more thoroughly in vivo than in vitro (5, 6). In vivo, the clinical results of PRRSV/swIAV superinfections vary according to the experimental conditions and the virus strains studied. While some studies reported exacerbations of lung lesions (27, 28), others showed no difference in clinical signs compared with animals infected with a single virus (29–31). Additionally, the two viruses can interfere with each other (17). These contradictory data advocate for more reductionist in vitro studies on PRRSV/swIAV co-infections. The effects of swIAV/PRRSV co-infections at the cellular and molecular levels are still poorly understood. In vitro studies are important for understanding the direct interactions between viruses and specific cell types. This approach is essential for dissecting viral mechanisms and cellular immune responses in a controlled environment, but such in vitro studies have been less explored for co-infections with swIAV and PRRSV. An in vitro study on porcine tracheal epithelial cells have shown that, although PRRSV does not infect epithelial cells, it can modify the cells’ interferon response when inoculated simultaneously or shortly before with swIAV, thereby hindering the production of swIAV (32). Interestingly, a study using conventional pig lung tissue sections and AMs, the target cells of PRRSV, present results suggesting that in some conditions, upon co-infection, swIAV may inhibit PRRSV-2 replication (33). Whether this inhibition occurs also for PRRSV-1 strains, and what is the mechanisms and kinetic of this process remain to be explored. In this work, we assessed the effects of swIAV on AMs and evaluated the impact of swIAV and PRRSV-1 mono-or co-inoculation on AMs, as well as on the host cells targeted by both types of viruses, within a respiratory epithelial cells/AMs co-culture system. Additionally, this study employs a kinetic approach to elucidate potential interaction between the viruses by monitoring infection progression over time to identify critical phases and interferences in viral replication. Notably, the study also compares AMs sampled from animals from two rearing facilities presenting different sanitary status. In this study, we evaluated the interactions between a swIAV strain belonging to the European human-like reassortant swine H1N2 lineage and a PRRSV strain from the PRRSV-1 subtype 1, two viruses that were co-circulating in pig farms in Brittany, France, and for which epidemiological investigations reported a significant association regarding seropositive status (34). 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Virus production and titration The swIAV strain A/swine/Ille et Vilaine/0415/2011 (H1huN2), selected from the repository of the French National Reference Laboratory for Swine Influenza (ANSES, Ploufragan, France), was isolated in Brittany, France, from a pig with acute respiratory syndrome. The virus was propagated on Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) (ATCC reference CCL-34) cells for 24 hours (h) in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) (Eurobio scientific, Les Ulis, France) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) (Eurobio scientific) and 1% Penicillin (100 UI/mL)-Streptomycin (100 μg/mL) (PS) (Eurobio scientific), and 2 μg/mL of trypsin TPCK treated (Worthington Biochemical Corp., Lakewood, NJ, United States). Following collection, the supernatant underwent clarification by centrifugation (600 × g, 20 min) and subsequent purification on Amicon Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filters (Sigma-Aldrich) after a 30 min centrifugation at 4,000 × g and 4°C. Virus titer was determined using the Tissue Culture Infectious Dose (TCID50) assay protocol on MDCK and calculated according to the Reed and Muench method (35). The final titer of the viral stock reached 108 TCID50/mL. The PRRSV strain PRRS-FR-2005-29-24-1 (Finistère strain; PRRSV-1 subtype 1) (ANSES’ collection) was isolated in Brittany, France, in 2005 from a pig herd whose sows had experienced reproductive failures. This strain is identified as low pathogenic (36). The virus was cultured on fresh porcine alveolar macrophages (AMs) in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium (Eurobio scientific) supplemented with 10% FCS and 1% Penicillin (100 UI/mL)-Streptomycin (100 μg/mL)-Amphotericin (0.25 μg/mL) (PSA) (Dutscher) for 48 h after isolation. After clarification and purification using Amicon filters, the virus titer was determined using the (TCID50)protocol on AMs and calculated using the Kärber method (37). The resulting viral titer was 109 TCID50/mL. 2.2 Alveolar macrophages AMs were sourced from five 5-to 6-month-old conventional pigs of the Large White breed. These pigs were euthanized as part of routine management procedures at the Unité Expérimentale de Physiologie Animale de l’Orfrasière (UEPAO, Tours, France). They were serologically free of PRRSV, and their status regarding swIAV is unknown. Collection of AMs was performed through two bronchoalveolar lavages (BAL) on the lungs, utilizing 250 mL phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with 2 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) (Sigma-Aldrich) for each lavage. Similarly, AMs from six 8-week-old specific pathogen-free (SPF) piglets were acquired through bronchoalveolar lavages. These piglets were obtained from the SPF herd (Supplementary Table S1) of the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety (ANSES, Ploufragan, France). The obtained AMs were frozen in FCS with 10% DMSO and stored in liquid nitrogen. 2.3 Newborn pig tracheal epithelial cell line NPTr cells (38) were cultured in Minimum Essential Medium (MEM, Eurobio scientific) supplemented with 10% FCS and 1% PSA, and incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2. 2.4 Cell cultures and virus inoculations For the AMs monocultures, cells were thawed, seeded in 24-well plates at 1.6 × 106 cells per well. After 1 h of incubation, they were mixed by pipetting, followed by another hour of incubation. After the 2 h incubation period, non-adherent cells were removed by washing twice with RPMI-1640 medium, enriching the BAL cells with adherent AMs. After 2 h of incubation following thawing, AMs cultures were single or co-inoculated with swIAV and PRRSV, at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.5 or 1, respectively. For co-inoculation, both viruses were mixed extemporaneously, immediately prior to be deposited on cells. Cells cultured in complete RPMI medium only served as negative controls. Virus adsorption was allowed for 1 h at 37°C and 5% CO2 with rocking agitation. Subsequently, the cultured cells were washed with RPMI and maintained at 37°C and 5% CO2 in 1 mL of RPMI medium supplemented with 1% PS and 10% FCS. At 1, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h post-inoculation (hpi) cell supernatants were collected and stored at −80°C. The cells were lysed using the lysis buffer of the NucleoSpin RNA Plus XS kit (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany), and stored at −80°C. For the NPTr/AMs co-cultures, AMs and NPTr cells were cultured in MEM supplemented with 10% FCS and 1% PS, and incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2. NPTr cells were seeded in 24-well plates at a density of 3 × 105 cells per well and cultured at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 24 h to reach 100% confluence. After washing with MEM, AMs were added to the culture at 1.2 × 106 cells per well and incubated at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 24 h to promote their adherence to NPTr cells. NPTr/AMs co-cultures were inoculated with viruses in the same manner as the AMs monoculture protocol, using either single or co-inoculation with swIAV at an MOI of 0.5 and PRRSV at an MOI of 1. The MOI was determined by counting the total number of cells in the NPTr/AMs co-culture wells just before virus inoculation. After the virus inoculation step, co-cultured cells were kept at 37°C with 5% CO2 in 2 mL of complete MEM medium. Cell lysates and supernatants were collected and stored at −80°C at 1, 12, 24, and 48 hpi. The cell layers were lysed using the lysis buffer of the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen), and stored at −80°C. 2.5 Cell viability assays Conventional pig AMs were thawed and seeded at 1.2 × 106 cells per well in an 8-well μ-Slide plate (Cat. No. 80826, ibidi GmbH, Germany) using complete RPMI medium. The cells were inoculated for 48 h with swIAV at different MOI 0.1, 0.5, and 2, or with PRRSV at a MOI of 2 to serve as a positive control for cell death. Subsequently, the cells were stained with Hoechst 33342 (Sigma-Aldrich, 14,533, bisBenzimide H 33342 trihydrochloride) at 5 μg/mL for 10 min at 37°C, followed by staining with Propidium Iodide (PI) (Sigma, P4170) at a final concentration of 1.5 × 10−3 mM for an additional 10 min at room temperature (RT). The labeled cells were then fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 15 min at 37°C, followed by a PBS rinse. Fluorescence from labeled cells was analyzed using Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CSLM) (Zeiss LSM 780, Germany) with Plan Apochromat 20x/0.8NA objective lens. Dual sequential laser excitation with 405 nm and 561 nm beam laser was used to observe both fluorescent signals generated by Hoechst (405 nm excitation) and Propidium Iodide (561 nm excitation). The images were analyzed, and the cells were counted using Fiji software (39). 2.6 Immunofluorescence assays In an 8-well μ-Slide plate, NPTr cells were seeded at 6 × 104 cells per well and cultured with complete MEM at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 24 h. Conventional pig AMs were thawed and seeded at 1.6 × 106 cells per well using complete RPMI medium at 37°C and 5% CO2 overnight. The cells were inoculated with swIAV for 6 and 12 h at MOI 0.5 for each type of cell. The cells were fixed with 1% PFA for 10 min at RT and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) for an extra 10 min. SwIAV infected cells were identified using a mouse monoclonal antibody targeting the viral nucleoprotein (dilution 1/50) (OBT0846, clone: 1341, Bio-Rad), and cell nuclei were stained with 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Sigma-Aldrich) at 2 μg/mL for 30 min at RT in a PBS-5% goat serum-5% pig serum blocking solution. This step was followed by incubation with an appropriate goat anti-mouse secondary antibody coupled to Alexafluor555 (dilution 1/100) (Ref: A21121, Invitrogen) for 30 min at RT in the same blocking solution. Washes between each step were performed with PBS-0.5% Tween 20 (Sigma-Aldrich). The cells were then fixed again with 1% PFA. Fluorescence from labeled cells was analyzed using CSLM (Nikon C2, Nikon Europe B.V., Amsterdam, Netherlands) with APO LWD 40x/1.15NA water immersion objective lens. Dual sequential laser excitation with 405 nm and 561 nm beam laser was used to observe both fluorescent signals generating by DAPI (405 nm excitation) and Alexafluo555 (561 nm excitation). The images were analyzed, and the cells were counted using Fiji software (39). 2.7 Immune gene expression analysis and viral quantification by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction Total RNA extraction from AMs cultures and NPTr/AMs co-cultures was performed using the NucleoSpin RNA Plus XS kit (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany) and the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen), respectively, following the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA from cell culture supernatants was extracted using the NucleoSpin Virus Mini kit for viral RNA/DNA purification (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany), following the manufacturer’s instructions. The quantity and quality of the total RNA were assessed using the Nanophotometer (Implen, Munich, Germany). Subsequent cDNA synthesis was performed using reverse transcriptase in the iScript Reverse Transcription Supermix for RT-qPCR (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, United States). The resulting cDNA was then combined with primer/probe sets and IQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad), in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations. The qPCR assays replicated the methods described in a previous study (32) (Supplementary Table S2). Viral genome quantification was performed through semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using TaqMan technology with Takyon No Rox Probe MasterMix dTTP blue 2× (Eurogentec, Liège, Belgium). The targeted regions included the open reading frame 5 (ORF5) of the Finistère strain, and the M gene of swine influenza A virus following the methodology described by Saade et al. (32). The qPCR assays were conducted on a CFX96 Connect and CFX Opus (Bio-Rad). For internal normalization, samples were simultaneously evaluated using the average Cycle quantification (Cq) of two stable reference genes in each sample, namely, the ribosomal protein L19 (RPL19) and the ribosomal protein S24 (RPS24) (40). Subsequently, qPCR data (Cq) underwent Genex macro analysis (Bio-Rad) (41) and were expressed as relative values following the Genex macro analysis. 2.8 Statistics Due to the non-normal distribution, tested by Shapiro–Wilk test, the Mann–Whitney unpaired test was used and the Kruskal-Wallis test was employed to analyze cellular gene expression. These analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software version 9.5.1, San Diego, CA, United States). The number of animals used and the replicates are specified in the legends of each figure. Virus titers below the detection limit (2.1 log10 TCID50/mL) were assigned a value of 0 log10 TCID50/mL. 3 Results 3.1 swIAV inoculation on alveolar macrophages from conventional pigs We first compared the ability of AMs and epithelial cells to support swIAV gene expression and particle production using a low MOI of 0.1 at different post-inoculation (pi) times: 1, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h. In both AMs and NPTr cells, intracellular viral gene expression peaked at 12 hpi and then decreased over time. However, at 12 hpi, the viral genome was expressed 74 times more in NPTr cells than in AMs (Figure 1A). Then, titration of infectious viral particles in cell culture supernatants was performed, and no infectious virus was detected for AMs. In contrast, in NPTr cells, which served as a positive control for viral replication, swIAV inoculated at a MOI of 0.1 showed productive replication, with high replication remaining constant between 12 and 48 h and average titers of 105.03 TCID50/mL (Figure 1B). Interestingly, when higher MOIs of 0.5 and 2 were used, viral genome expression in AMs increased in a MOI-dependent manner (Figure 1C). However, virus titration revealed only low titers that peaked at 24 h, averaging 102.95 and 102.70 TCID50/mL for MOIs of 0.5 and 2, respectively (Figure 1D). Figure 1 Figure 1. Inoculation of swine influenza A virus on conventional porcine alveolar macrophages. (A,B) Conventional porcine AMs and NPTr were inoculated with swIAV at MOI 0.1. Adherent cells and supernatants were sampled at different times post-inoculation (1, 12, 24, 36, 48 h). Expression of the swIAV viral genome was quantified by RT-qPCR (A), and the virus was titrated in supernatants (B) (mean ± SD; for AMs n = 2, and for NPTr n = 3). (C,D) Conventional porcine AMs were inoculated with swIAV at different MOI 0.1, 0.5, and 2. Adherent cells and supernatants were sampled at different times post-inoculation (1, 12, 24, 36, 48 h). Expression of the swIAV viral genome was quantified by RT-qPCR (C), and the virus was titrated in supernatants (D) (mean ± SD; n = 2). (E) AMs and NPTr cells were inoculated with swIAV at a MOI of 0.5. Cells were fixed after 6 h and 12 h post-inoculation and stained with an antibody against the nucleoprotein to detect infected cells (in red). Cell nuclei were stained (in white) using 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). (E1) Confocal imaging of NPTr and AMs cells, 12 h post inoculation with swIAV. Upper panel NPTr cells. Lower panel AMs cells. Nuclear staining with DAPI, swIAV immunodetection and merge (from left to right). Scale bars = 20 μm. (E2) The number of infected cells was calculated in relation to the total number of cells (n = 3, technical replicate). (F) AMs were inoculated with either medium alone or swIAV at a MOI of 0.5 or 2; or PRRSV at a MOI of 2. After 48 h, cells were stained with propidium iodide/Hoechst. Each symbol corresponds to AMs from a single animal. The number of dead cells was calculated in relation to the total number of cells. Statistics Mann–Whitney unpaired, non-parametric test, (*) p < 0.05 or (**) p < 0.01 (mean ± SD; n = 6). Microscopic analysis of MOI 0.5 inoculated cells at 6 and 12 hpi confirmed that swIAV did not undergo productive replication in AMs. Indeed, at 6 hpi, an average of 0.1% of NPTr cells were positive for swIAV nucleoprotein staining, while no AMs were detected as positive for swIAV nucleoprotein. By 12 hpi, the rate of positive cells increased to an average of 8% in NPTr cells and 0.2% in AMs (Figure 1E). The cytotoxic effect of swIAV on host cells was evaluated using PI/Hoechst staining. AMs were inoculated with swIAV at MOIs 0.5 and 2, or with PRRSV at MOI 2, used as a positive control to induce AMs death. Following a 48 h swIAV exposure, a significant (p < 0.05) number of dead cells were observed at MOI 2 but not at MOI 0.5 (Figure 1F). Thus, in order to study the impact of swIAV on PRRSV multiplication in AMs, we subsequently inoculated swIAV at MOI 0.5, the highest concentration that did not induce significant AMs cell death. 3.2 Co-inoculation of swIAV and PRRSV on alveolar macrophages from conventional pigs To explore how swIAV infection might affect interactions between AMs and PRRSV, we co-inoculated AMs with swIAV and PRRSV. PRRSV was used at the intermediate MOI of 1 that would allow a strong infectious input while providing space for further viral amplification. AMs from conventional pigs were exposed to culture medium, to swIAV (MOI 0.5), to PRRSV (MOI 1), or to both viruses simultaneously at MOI 0.5 and 1, respectively. Samples were collected at 1, 12, 24, 36, and 48 hpi, and the expression of swIAV and PRRSV transcripts were analyzed (Figures 2A–D). Figure 2 Figure 2. Simultaneous co-inoculation of swIAV and PRRSV viruses on AMs from conventional pigs. AMs were inoculated with either culture medium, swIAV at a MOI of 0.5, PRRSV at a MOI of 1, or both viruses simultaneously. Samples were collected at 1, 12, 24, 36 and 48 h. (A,B) The expression of the swIAV (A) and PRRSV (B) viral genomes was quantified using RT-qPCR in cell lysates (mean ± SD; n = 4). (C,D) For the PRRSV inoculated and swIAV/PRRSV co-inoculated conditions, the expression of the PRRSV genome was individually evaluated for AMs from each animal. (E–H) The expression of the antiviral genes IFNα, IFNβ, MX2, and PKR were analyzed by RT-qPCR. Statistics Kruskal-Walis, non-parametric test (mean ± SD; n = 4). Data are combined from 2 independent experiments. The results confirmed that swIAV did not replicate in AMs, and co-inoculation with PRRSV did not affect the replication of swIAV in AMs (Figure 2A). As expected, PRRSV inoculation of AMs led to strong viral amplification, regardless of the animal from which the cells originated (Figures 2B,C). In swIAV/PRRSV co-inoculation condition, the PRRSV genome replicated similarly to when PRRSV was inoculated alone in AMs from only three out of four animals (Figure 2D). However, in AMs from one animal (animal D), we observed an inhibition of PRRSV replication starting between 24 and 36 h post-inoculation, suggesting that swIAV co-inoculation had an impact on PRRSV replication in this specific case (Figure 2D). Thus, the expression of antiviral genes was analyzed (Figures 2E–H). Interferon levels exhibited considerable variability among different conditions and among individuals. No difference was observed in interferon alpha (IFNα) levels across conditions and over time (Figure 2E). However, for interferon beta (IFNβ), in the conditions inoculated with PRRSV (PRRSV and swIAV/PRRSV groups), a trend toward increased IFNβ expression at 36 h was observed, although it was not significant (p > 0.05) compared to the Mock and swIAV groups (Figure 2F). Additionally, the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) MX2 and PKR was examined (Figures 2G,H). As indicated by their name, ISG expression is triggered in response to interferon production and is thus indicative of actual protein expression and the release of type I and III interferons (42). Similar to interferons, variability was also observed in ISG expression (Supplementary Figure S1). Interestingly, despite IFNβ expression appears to be increased in the PRRSV and swIAV/PRRSV groups as early as 36 h, ISGs were not induced (Figures 2G,H). Upon observing the expression of ISGs for each individual, we noted a notable change at 12 hpi for animal D under conditions infected with the swIAV virus (Supplementary Figure S1). At this time point, we observed that only in animal D, MX2 and PKR showed higher expression under exposure to swIAV and swIAV/PRRSV compared to the Mock and PRRSV groups, unlike the other animals (Supplementary Figures S2A,B). 3.3 Co-inoculation of swIAV and PRRSV on alveolar macrophages from specific pathogen-free piglets We hypothesized that the variability in ISG induction during swIAV interaction depending on AMs donor could be attributed to animal history of lung inflammation like environmental particles (43), or former contacts with infectious stimuli, as described previously in murine and human studies, which indicated a modification in the AMs response upon viral (44) or bacterial (45) stimulations. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the direct effects of swIAV and PRRSV on AMs while minimizing external factors like previous infections, which could potentially influence the macrophage response. In order to investigate this possibility, we sought to replicate these experiments using AMs from younger animals, thus exposed for a shorter time to a potentially inflammatory environment, originated from a specific pathogen-free (SPF) herd bred under air filtration (Figures 3A–H). Figure 3 Figure 3. Simultaneous co-inoculation of swIAV and PRRSV viruses on AMs from specific pathogen-free piglets. AMs were inoculated with either culture medium, swIAV at a MOI of 0.5, PRRSV at a MOI of 1, or both viruses simultaneously. Samples were collected at 1, 12, 24, 36 and 48 h. (A–D) The expression of swIAV viral genome was quantified in the cell lysates using RT-qPCR (A), and the virus was titrated in supernatants (B). The expression of PRRSV viral genome was quantified in the cell lysates using RT-qPCR (C), and the virus was titrated in supernatants (D). Statistics Mann–Whitney unpaired, non-parametric test, (*) p < 0.05 or (**) p < 0.01 (mean ± SD; n = 5–6). (E–H) The expression of the antiviral genes IFNα, IFNβ, MX2 and PKR were analyzed by RT-qPCR. Statistics Kruskal-Walis, non-parametric test. Different letters (a–d) indicate that the considered group (specified by its color) was significantly different from the Mock group (a), from the swIAV group (b), from the PRRSV group (c) or from the swIAV/PRRSV group (d) with p < 0.05 (mean ± SD; n = 6). Data are combined from 2 independent experiments. Following swIAV inoculation and swIAV/PRRSV co-inoculation, we observed similar swIAV replication as observed in conventional AMs, further confirming that swIAV underwent abortive replication in porcine AMs (Figures 3A,B). However, concerning PRRSV, co-inoculation with swIAV led to an inhibition of PRRSV genome replication from 24 hpi, paralleled with an inhibition of infectious viral particle production (Figures 3C,D; Supplementary Figure S3). Next, we assessed the expression of antiviral genes (Figures 3E–H). For the swIAV inoculation condition, no difference in interferon expression was observed (Figures 3E,F). However, there was a slight, non-significant increase in ISG MX2 and PKR at 12 hpi (Figures 3G,H). Upon co-inoculation with swIAV/PRRSV, an early significant (p < 0.05) increase in IFNβ transcriptomic expression was noted at 12 hpi (Figure 3F). This increase in IFNβ was accompanied by increases in MX2 and PKR ISG expression (p < 0.05) (Figures 3G,H). In the PRRSV condition, significant (p < 0.05) IFNβ and IFNα expressions were observed at later times post-infection, respectively 24 and 36 hpi (Figures 3E,F). However, this transcriptomal type-I IFN increase did not result in functional IFN-I protein release since no significant (p > 0.05) increase in ISG expression was observed compared to the control condition (Figures 3G,H). These results suggested that exposure to swIAV in AMs from SPF pigs quickly activated the expression of antiviral genes, potentially playing a role in inhibiting PRRSV replication. 3.4 Co-inoculation of swIAV and PRRSV in an epithelial respiratory cells/alveolar macrophages co-culture system A co-culture system involving AMs and NPTr cells was established. The objective of using such a system was to study the interaction between swIAV and PRRSV infections in the presence of their respective main target cells. Both viral infections were compared in co-cultures using AMs derived either from conventional or SPF pigs (Figures 4, 5). Figure 4 Figure 4. Simultaneous co-inoculation of swIAV and PRRSV viruses on epithelial cell line/AMs co-cultures derived from both specific pathogen-free and conventional swine. NPTr epithelial cells and AMs were inoculated with either culture medium, swIAV at a MOI of 0.5, PRRSV at a MOI of 1, or both viruses simultaneously. Samples were collected at 1, 12, 24, and 48 h. On the left side are presented the results for SPF pig AMs, and on the right are the results for conventional pig AMs. (A,B) The expression of the swIAV viral genome was quantified in the cell lysates using RT-qPCR. (C,D) The expression of the PRRSV viral genome was quantified in the cell lysates using RT-qPCR. Statistics Mann–Whitney unpaired, non-parametric test, (*) p < 0.05 or (**) p < 0.01 (mean ± SD; n = 6 for SPF swine AMs; n = 4 for conventional swine AMs). Data are combined from 2 independent experiments for AMs originating from SPF or conventional swine. Figure 5 Figure 5. Simultaneous co-inoculation of swIAV and PRRSV viruses on epithelial cell line/AMs co-cultures derived from both specific pathogen-free and conventional swine. NPTr epithelial cells and AMs were inoculated with either culture medium, swIAV at a MOI of 0.5, PRRSV at a MOI of 1, or both viruses simultaneously. Samples were collected at 1, 12, 24, and 48 h. On the left side are presented the results for SPF pig AMs and on the right are the results for conventional pig AMs. (A–H) The expression of the antiviral genes IFNα, IFNβ, MX2, and PKR were analyzed by RT-qPCR. Statistics Kruskal-Walis, non-parametric test. Different letters (a–d) indicate that the considered group (specified by its color) was significantly different from the Mock group (a), from the swIAV group (b), from the PRRSV group (c) or from the swIAV/PRRSV group (d) with p < 0.05 (mean ± SD; n = 6 for SPF swine AMs; n = 4 for conventional swine AMs). Data are combined from 2 independent experiments for AMs originating from SPF or conventional swine. In NPTr/AMs co-culture, similar patterns were observed in the expression of the swIAV and PRRSV genomes in cell lysates, whatever the AMs origin, i.e., from SPF or conventional pigs. No significant (p > 0.05) difference in swIAV genome replication was observed within the cells, whether through single inoculation or co-inoculation with PRRSV (Figures 4A,B). However, we observed complete inhibition of PRRSV replication as early as 12 hpi when co-inoculated with swIAV in co-culture with SPF pig AMs, and as early as 24 hpi in co-culture with conventional pig AMs (Figures 4C,D; Supplementary Figures S4). The inhibition was significantly more pronounced at both 24 hpi (p < 0.01) and 48 hpi (p < 0.05) compared to that measured after PRRSV inoculation in monoculture of SPF pig AMs (Supplementary Figures S5A,B). Additionally, the percentage of PRRSV inhibition was significantly higher in co-cultures making use of SPF AMs compared to conventional AMs at 24 h (p < 0.05), but not at 48 h (Supplementary Figures S5C,D). In co-inoculated AMs from conventional pigs, PRRSV replication was inhibited in all animals, including animals A and B, which were initially used for monoculture experiments and for which no inhibition was observed (Supplementary Figure S4D). Detection of PRRSV in supernatants followed similar patterns than intracellular virus detection, with swIAV-mediated inhibition (Supplementary Figure S6). Regarding the expression of antiviral genes during co-culture (Figures 5A–H), significant (p < 0.05) expression of IFNα was observed at an early stage (12 h) post-inoculation with swIAV alone, whatever the type of AMs used in the co-culture (Figures 5A,B). For IFNβ, significant early expression at 12 hpi was also observed in the swIAV (p < 0.05) and swIAV/PRRSV (p < 0.01) conditions in co-culture using AMs from SPF pigs, whereas in the PRRSV condition, IFNβ expression occurred with a slight delay at 24 hpi (p < 0.01) (Figure 5C). In co-cultures with AMs from conventional pigs, changes in IFNβ expression showed similar trend to those observed in co-cultures with AMs from SPF pigs, with increased expression at 12 hpi. However, the results were not significant compared to the Mock group (p > 0.05) in both the swIAV (p = 0.09) and swIAV/PRRSV (p = 0.06) conditions (Figure 5D). Regarding ISG expression, in co-culture with SPF pig AMs, the MX2 gene showed an early increase at 12 hpi in the swIAV and swIAV/PRRSV conditions (p < 0.05), persisting at high levels up to 48 hpi (p < 0.05). In the PRRSV group, significant (p < 0.05) MX2 expression was only observed from 48 hpi onwards (Figure 5E). The expression pattern of MX2 at 12 hpi with conventional AMs in the swIAV and swIAV/PRRSV conditions was similar to that in co-cultures with SPF pig AMs. However, these results were not significant compared to the Mock group (p = 0.10) for both swIAV and swIAV/PRRSV condition (Figure 5F). A significant difference in expression of the PKR gene was found with SPF AMs at 24 hpi for the swIAV condition (p < 0.01) and at 48 hpi for the PRRSV condition (p < 0.01), as compared to mock-inoculated cells (Figure 5G). In contrast, the co-cultures with AMs from conventional pigs also exhibited a significant (p < 0.05) increase in PKR expression for the swIAV/PRRSV condition, from 12 to 48 hpi (Figure 5H), despite the non-significance of IFNβ expression (Figure 5D). 4 Discussion AMs are among the first cells to respond to IAV infection due to their strategic location in the respiratory tract. They play a crucial role in fighting infection, as evidenced by studies showing that AMs-depleted animals exhibit high pulmonary virus replication, increased tissue damage, and elevated mortality rates (46, 47). Despite the known importance of AMs in IAV infection outcomes and pathogenicity, the impact of AMs infection by IAV remains debated in the literature. Some studies have shown active IAV replication in AMs, while others have reported non-productive replication (26, 48). Research on IAV replication in human and murine AMs has revealed productive viral replication after inoculation of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (H5N1) but not of human seasonal strains (26, 48). Additionally, it has been demonstrated that human monocyte-derived macrophages, but not AMs, can support productive replication of some human and avian IAV subtypes (26, 49). Concerning porcine macrophages, previous studies have shown that the human H1N1pdm09 virus can infect and replicate in a porcine macrophage cell line (3D4), leading to apoptosis (21). However, in an older study, infection of porcine AMs in vitro with seasonal human strains H3N2 or H1N1 did not show apoptosis after 48 h, despite viral infection of the cells. Additionally, in vivo, AMs obtained from pigs inoculated with the same strains also did not demonstrate apoptosis 5 days post-infection (50). Furthermore, porcine AMs have been shown to be susceptible to various strains of avian, human, and swine IAVs, with only avian strains inducing apoptosis 6 h post-inoculation (22). Here, we examined the effects of swIAV on porcine AMs. We observed that the tested H1huN2 swIAV strain led to non-productive infection of AMs and induced their death only at a high multiplicity of infection (MOI 2). This variability observed in the impact of different IAV strains on macrophages seems to be influenced by the macrophage subtype, the species used, and the IAV genetic factors. For instance, an amino acid replacement in the virus hemagglutinin might alter the IAV infection and cell death susceptibility of AMs. Cardenas et al. (51) demonstrated this with an H3N2 reassortant (hVIC/11) containing the HA and NA segments from a seasonal human virus and the other genes from a swine strain (sOH/04). This combination, including a point mutation near the HA receptor binding site (A138S), showed a higher affinity for porcine AMs. The hVIC/11 A138S infected both the upper and lower respiratory tracts, whereas the hVIC/11 was only detected in the upper respiratory tract 5 days post-infection. Additionally, AMs in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples were significantly reduced in pigs infected with sOH/04 and hVIC/11 A138S, but not in those infected with hVIC/11. Further analysis using the porcine AMs cell line 3D4/21 showed that the A138S mutation increases the virus’ replication capacity compared to hVIC/11. Our understanding of abortive IAV infection in macrophages is complicated by the diversity of macrophage sources (such as those derived from mice or humans) and the various IAV strains, including highly pathogenic ones. Studies aimed at understanding the mechanisms of viral abortion in macrophages have revealed that infection of murine and human macrophages by the seasonal H1N1 virus can be blocked at different stages: (i) during the viral entry phase (52), (ii) after internalization but before nuclear entry (48), (iii) at a late stage of the viral replication, during the assembly of viral particles, preventing the release of new virions (52, 53). Additionally, cell death mechanisms, such as apoptosis and necroptosis, can also limit the spread of the virus. Indeed, IAV infection can induce macrophage death (22, 54), as observed in our results at a high MOI of 2, although our experimental co-inoculation conditions were set up in order to avoid this IAV-mediated cell-death. In our study, we found that swIAV replication in AMs was not modulated in the presence of PRRSV. By contrast, the presence of swIAV impacted PRRSV replication, both in AMs monoculture and in NPTr/AMs co-culture. This phenomenon was accompanied by an early induction of IFN-I and ISG, as observed at 12 hpi. Since IAV is known to induce IFN-I production in AMs (15, 21, 55), the increased IFN-I and ISG transcript levels might be accountable for IFN-mediated inhibition of PRRSV replication in agreement with a previous in vitro work studying swIAV/PRRSV-2 strains interferences (33). The induction of IFN-I by swIAV and the subsequent inhibition of PRRSV are consistent with previous in vivo studies, as we showed that swIAV infection significantly affected PRRSV multiplication in SPF pig lungs (17). Correlation studies revealed an important role of IFNα in the interference between these two viral infections. Another in vivo study in SPF pigs demonstrated that swIAV infection delayed the viremia of a live attenuated PRRSV vaccine, with an early an IFNα increase detected after swIAV infection, likely responsible for PRRSV replication inhibition (56). Additionally, this local upregulation of IFNα might account for the increased anti-PRRSV CD8 T-cell response observed in vivo during swIAV H3N2/PRRSV-2 co-infections (31). PRRSV has developed several strategies to evade IFN action and to persist in the host (10). For example, it can increase specific porcine miRNAs like let-7b, miR-26a, miR-34a and miR-145. These miRNAs can hinder the expression of IFNβ protein in primary AMs by directly targeting nucleic acid sequences in the 3′UTR of porcine IFNβ mRNA. This action suppresses IFNβ protein expression at the post-transcriptional level (57). This may explain why PRRSV was not inhibited when inoculated alone on AMs and NPTr/AMs cultures, despite strong IFN-I mRNA expression as early as 24 hpi. The increase in IFNβ transcript expression did not lead to ISGs upregulation, suggesting an absence of functional IFNβ protein. In swIAV and swIAV/PRRSV co-inoculation, we observed a type-I IFN transcriptomic induction triggered by IAV, lower but earlier than upon PRRSV inoculation. This transcriptomic expression is paralleled with ISG induction, in agreement with an IFN-I effective protein expression. This IAV mediated antiviral gene expression correlates with the inhibition of PRRSV replication. Interestingly, the use of conventional pig AMs revealed diversity in host responses to viruses. AMs from animals A, B, and C reacted differently from those of animal D and SPF pig AMs in monoculture. As mentioned earlier, PRRSV inhibition in animal D and SPF pig AMs would be attributed to IFN-I and ISG induction by AMs. However, in AMs from animals A, B, and C, there was no ISG expression, suggesting an absence of IFN-I production, which might allow PRRSV replication. In our study, we used either AMs collected from 5-to 6-month-old conventional pigs from INRAE controlled breeding, or AMs from SPF pigs sampled at 2 months of age. More than the age, the sanitary status seemed to be the most important factor playing a role in the differences we observed following swIAV/PRRSV co-inoculations. Indeed, although the four conventional pigs were older than SPF pigs, one of them showed a response similar to SPF AMs. More specifically, we did not observe differences in PRRSV replication levels in the PRRSV single-inoculated condition, whether the AMs were from older or younger pigs. Interestingly, an in vitro study has shown that pulmonary intravascular macrophages (PIMs) from 4-week-old pigs yielded a higher virus titer following PRRSV infection compared to PIMs from 4-month-old pigs (58). However, these differences were not observed in our in vitro data, indicating that the age of the pigs does not have a significant impact on PRRSV replication in AMs under our experimental conditions. In summary, although age-related susceptibility variations have been previously noted, our in vitro results do not show such differences, suggesting that sanitary status is a more important determinant for the response of AMs to PRRSV infection. ANSES’ SPF animals were maintained in a highly clean environment and were free of all respiratory pathogens, as they were reared under air filtration, while INRAE’s animals came from a controlled environment (59) not deprived of potential respiratory pathogens. Interestingly a recent study highlighted the differential viral replication and immune responses of SPF and farm-raised Large White domestic pigs upon African swine fever systemic infections (60). At steady state, SPF pigs exhibited a less inflammatory and antiviral basal whole blood transcriptomic profile compared to farm-raised pigs. We indeed observed a similar trend with type-I IFN and ISG lower expressions in AM from SPF compared to conventional pigs (data not shown). Observations in mice have shown that following recovery from initial pneumonia, murine AMs exhibited modified phagocytic activity for several weeks (45). These paralyzed AMs originated from resident AMs that underwent a tolerogenic epigenetic training program. This may explain why, in our study, AMs from 1 out of 4 conventional animals showed similar behavior to AMs from SPF pigs, suggesting that the other three conventional pigs might have been infected by other pathogens including swIAV during their early lifetime. Another possibility described in mice is the depletion of fetal liver-origin AMs upon respiratory infections, leading to their replacement by monocyte-derived AMs (61, 62). These monocyte-derived AMs increased IAV-induced pathogenicity and mortality. This study also showed that the origin of AMs, rather than their previous experience, could determine their long-term function in recurrent viral infections (63). Thus, in some physiological conditions, the origin of AMs, rather than their previous experience, could determine their long-term function, although this hypothesis remains difficult to explore in pigs. The results presented here might suggest that AMs from most of conventional pigs (Animals A, B, and C) have undergone modifications and have been influenced by external factors at some point in their lives. In NPTr/AMs co-cultures, regardless of whether the AMs came from conventional or SPF pigs, both sources showed similar ability to inhibit PRRSV replication in the PRRSV/swAIV co-inoculation conditions. However, a greater inhibition of PRRSV was observed in co-culture with SPF AMs at 24 h only and not at 48 h. This inhibition could be attributed to swIAV replication in NPTr cells, leading to viral particle release entering and depleting AMs, but also to the production of IFN produced by AMs and by epithelial cells following swIAV infection. 5 Conclusion This study showed that, despite limited replication in AMs, swIAV could inhibit PRRSV replication in porcine AMs, likely through IFN-I modulation. We also observed variations in this swIAV-mediated PRRSV inhibition depending on the origins of the AMs. Whether these variations are due to the animal’s health history or to another unidentified parameter remain to be determined. Since AMs are targets for many infections and have a long lifespan, these observations justify the need for further research on the long-term impact of infections on innate respiratory immunity, as well as the study of viral interactions within the context of the swine respiratory disease complex. Notably, our co-culture experiments revealed that the presence of respiratory tracheal epithelial cells significantly enhances the swIAV-induced inhibition of PRRSV replication, indicating a synergistic effect between AMs and epithelial cells in antiviral responses, regardless of whether the AMs are derived from SPF or conventional pigs. Understanding these interactions could lead to the development of more effective prevention and control strategies for respiratory diseases in pigs, ultimately improving animal health and reducing economic losses in the swine industry.

Duck hunters are eternal optimists. It’s what stirs us at 4 a.m., with coffee brewing and decoys rigged despite three straight days of empty straps. But occasionally, that optimism is challenged in unexpected ways. Such was the case during fall of 2022, when hunters reported alarming die-offs of snow and Ross’s geese in the Central and Mississippi Flyways, and western hunters witnessed Canada and cackling geese with cloudy eyes and zombie-like movements. Testing confirmed H5N1 Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) was responsible. Since then, HPAI has received extensive coverage in the media and has become a common topic of discussion among waterfowlers. In this article we examine the history of HPAI and share what we’ve learned about the disease at the center of this discussion. History of HPAI Avian influenza (AI), also known as “bird flu,” is caused by naturally occurring viruses that primarily affect poultry and wild birds. These viruses can be categorized into many different subtypes, but all can be separated into two main groups—HPAI and Low Pathogenic Avian Influenza (LPAI)—reflecting the degree to which they cause illness or mortality in domestic poultry. As the names suggest, LPAI causes little or no illness in domestic birds, while HPAI may result in 100 percent mortality in affected flocks. The effects of these viruses on wild birds, other wildlife, and humans, however, varies considerably. The majority of AI viruses in wild birds are of the LPAI variety, and outbreaks of HPAI historically occurred only in domestic poultry. A New HPAI Virus The H5N1 HPAI virus responsible for the current outbreak can be traced to 1996, when it was first detected in domestic geese in Guangdong, China. Scientists believe it originated from influenza viruses circulating among wild birds and domestic poultry in the region. H5N1 HPAI reappeared in Hong Kong in 2002, marking the first detection of the virus in wild birds. Over the next 20 years, outbreaks of H5N1 HPAI occurred periodically in wild and domestic birds around the globe, each genetically linked to the 1996 Guangdong strain. This virus first appeared in North America in 2014, and by 2016 had resulted in the deaths of over 50 million poultry and $3 billion in damages. However, only limited illness occurred in wild waterfowl, and the outbreak eventually dissipated. Things changed in November 2021, when H5N1 HPAI reappeared in North America. By summer of 2022, infections among commercial poultry and wild birds were widespread across North America, and H5N1 had affected a greater number and diversity of birds and mammals in the United States than ever before. Transmission and Symptoms Birds become infected with AI after drinking or feeding in areas containing virus left behind through feces or mucous shed by affected birds. Viruses are also spread through bird-to-bird contact. While waterfowl are a natural host of AI viruses and are involved in their dispersal, evidence of direct transmission pathways between wild birds and poultry is limited. Infection routes for domestic birds may more commonly include use of shared habitats and indirect contact from contaminated materials or surfaces. Human activities, contaminated equipment, and soiled clothing can also contribute to viral spread between poultry operations. Symptoms of HPAI infections in birds include loss of coordination, swimming or walking in circles, inability to fly, a twisted neck, and death. However, not all infected wild waterfowl display symptoms. Impacts and Health Risks The US Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) plays a lead role in defending our nation’s food supply and agricultural community from HPAI through surveillance of both domestic and wild birds. Since 2022, APHIS has reported H5N1 in approximately 9,500 wild birds, although many more have likely been affected. The virus has been found in virtually all species of waterfowl, but illness and mortality have been particularly visible in snow, Ross’s, Canada, and cackling geese. First-year birds, which have not previously been exposed to the virus, may be most susceptible to infection, yet illness and death have also been reported in adult birds. Much remains to be learned about differences in disease susceptibility and severity across waterfowl species. Detections of HPAI in wild waterfowl have declined since 2022, although the virus continues to circulate. At present, biologists do not expect H5N1 to have significant long-term effects on waterfowl populations or directly affect harvest regulations. Impacts of the HPAI outbreak have been most severe in domestic poultry. As of July 2024, an astounding 99 million domestic birds in commercial and backyard flocks across 48 states have been affected. The most significant recent development has been detection of H5N1 HPAI in dairy cattle, affecting 158 herds across 13 states. This was the first-ever detection of avian influenza in cattle, signaling the virus’s unprecedented ability to infect new hosts. The H5N1 HPAI virus has also been linked to illness or death in 20 other species of mammals, with transmission primarily resulting from scavenging of infected bird carcasses. Although relatively rare, the H5N1 virus can infect humans. In the United States, four dairy workers with minor symptoms tested positive for H5N1 after direct exposure to infected dairy cows, and a small number of human infections were recently linked to contact with affected domestic poultry. Globally, H5N1 infections have sometimes led to serious human disease and even death, but health experts report that the overall risk to the general population remains low in the United States. The Role of Hunters USDA WS/Kelsey Weir What should waterfowlers do to protect themselves and prevent the spread of HPAI? First, hunters should report sick birds or unusual deaths to state veterinary offices or APHIS. Second, hunters should follow all APHIS guidelines for handling harvested waterfowl. These practices are especially important for hunters who interact with commercial or backyard poultry flocks. “You won’t always know if a bird is carrying the virus as not all infected waterfowl are symptomatic. If you are out in a wetland or field, assume one bird out there is carrying AI. Make sure to follow protocol and keep everything clean,” says Dr. Julianna Lenoch, National Wildlife Disease Program coordinator at APHIS. Lastly, by participating in state and federal HPAI surveillance efforts, hunters can help scientists track changes in viral prevalence and genetic mutation. The long-term prognosis for H5N1 in North America remains uncertain, although most experts agree it is a disease we will contend with for the foreseeable future. As for our canine hunting companions, a recent study found that transmission to domestic dogs is possible but very rare. Nevertheless, dogs should not be allowed to retrieve birds that appear sick or have been found dead. Hunters should also avoid feeding their dogs raw meat from harvested birds and prevent access to discarded carcasses. It’s late summer now and we can feel the nights cooling and winds changing, bringing the promise of the waterfowl season to come. Optimism aside, we hope you’ll take the necessary precautions and share this information with your fellow hunters, because we all have a role to play.

Yet, robust evidence to support this belief has been lacking. This risk was investigated in a laboratory setting by measuring the amount of viable influenza virus successfully transferred from artificially contaminated medical (surgical) mask surfaces to a human finger used to swipe their outer surface under various experimental conditions. Despite being exposed to high levels of virus contamination on the masks, very little or no viable virus was successfully transferred from the mask to the finger in these experiments.

The latter route has long been emphasized in the field of infection control. The touching of contaminated masks is also traditionally assumed to be a risk of viral transmission in hospital infection control practices for the prevention of nosocomial infection of influenza, as well as of other infectious diseases. However, there is a notable lack of evidence supporting this route of transmission, despite the amount of infection control guidance related to this, including various personal protective equipment (PPE) donning/doffing guidelines1.This study, conducted in a laboratory setting, investigates this risk for influenza transmission by quantitatively assessing the transfer of viable viruses from artificially contaminated medical (surgical) masks to human fingers. The surgical masks were exposed to airborne virus under differing experimental conditions, which mimicked common clinical exposure scenarios.ResultsOverall, with this experimental simulation, the number of transferred viruses was under the detection level or almost undetectable from the contaminated mask surfaces to the swiping finger. No virus or only a small amount (maximum 10 pfu) of the virus was detected in the experiments that used the nebulizer and coughing machine, which used large amounts of the virus under conditions reasonably favorable for influenza virus survival (20 °C, 20% RH) (Fig. 1a, b). Similarly, in the spray experiments under a variety of temperatures and RHs, little or no virus was detected on the swiping fingertip (Fig. 1c).Fig. 1External mask surface-to-finger virus transfer results, after mask exposure to the simulated environmental aerosols (a), simulated coughing (b) and large droplet spraying (c). For a (simulated environmental aerosols), the column plots show the amount of exhaled viable influenza virus particles (solid bar) and viral RNA (open bar) captured in the aerosols after sampling for 30 min from the air (I), the theoretical maximum amount of virus that should be captured on the mask during 30 min of simulated breathing (II), and the measured amount of virus collected by a finger swipe from the mask surface (III). Column (IV) shows the viral RNA copies detected from the outer layer of the mask. For (b) (simulated coughing), the amounts of viable virus (solid bar) and viral RNA (open bar) detected after finger-swiping of the mask, at exposure from distances of 100 and 200 cm are shown. For (c) (large droplet spraying), the plaque-forming (viable) virus and viral RNA detection, are shown at 20 and 30 °C, at 20, 50, and 70% relative humidities, for each size (100, 200, and 500 μm diameter) of the droplet, at 30 min sampling times. In all figures, the dotted and dashed lines show the minimum detection limits of the plaque-forming and RT-qPCR assays.Full size imageDiscussionSurgical masks are designed to capture and trap aerosol particles by multiple means, including inertial impaction, gravity sedimentation, electrostatic attraction, diffusion, and interception2. It has been a concern that viral transfer from the mask surface contaminated with the virus via fingers or hands causes infection since people touch the face frequently while even wearing it (e.g., 5–6.4 face touches/h)3,4. However, there is little or no evidence of transfer of the viable virus. Our calibration studies (Figs. S1c, S2b, S3) were performed in order to measure the viral load in the air when it was directly sampled for 30 min (225 L). This gave an estimate of the viral load entering the breathing zone of the unmasked manikin head and the total amount of virus passing through the mask area. This allowed an approximation of the theoretical maximum amount of virus that could potentially be trapped on or within the mask. They showed a clear contrast with the viral load recovered from the finger that swiped the mask surface. The viral titer of the sampled aerosol was 5.9 × 102 pfu/L air and 4.9 × 104 viral RNA copies/L air (see Fig. 1a). This is far higher than various studies of ambient aerosol viral loads for influenza in real-world studies5,6. Yet, despite exposing the mask to these massive aerosolized virus loads, little or no viable virus transferred to the fingertip from the mask surface. From these results, it would be unlikely that viable viruses would be recovered from fingertips that touched contaminated physical and environmental surfaces, even with different types/subtypes of other human influenza viruses.So why was the amount of virus recovered from the mask surface via the fingertip so low? Firstly, not all of the airborne viruses inhaled through the mask would remain on the outer layer of the mask since a certain proportion of the inhaled viruses penetrate a surgical mask7. Those viruses that passed through the surface layer would not be touchable by the swiping fingertip. This ratio of surface (touchable) virus versus virus possibly penetrating the mask can be deduced as follows. In the pre-experimental calibration studies, the amount of virus that could have been inhaled without the mask, was theoretically calculated to be 1.0 × 107 viral RNA copies. The actual viral load detected from the surface sheet of the central area cut out was only 2.4 × 105 viral RNA copies (mean of 3.19 × 105 and 1.47 × 105 copies). Hence, the recovery efficiency of viral gene copy numbers is 2.4 × 10–2. Secondly, the airborne virus in this study had a viable virus/viral RNA copy ratio of about 1:103 (Fig. 1a column I).So if this same recovery rate could be applied to the virus detected on the mask outer layer (2.4 × 105 viral RNA copies), about 2.4 × 102 pfu of viable virus might be detected. However, the amount of detectable virus recovered from the fingertip swipe was only < 3.3 pfu (less than the detection limit of the plaque assay) and < 3.0 × 103 viral RNA copies (less than the detection limit of the PCR assay) (the recovery efficiency of viable virus, < 1.4 × 10–2) (Fig. 1).We noted relatively little change in the ratio of the airborne viruses released from the nebulizer for 30 min after atomization in the calibration experiments (Fig. S4). Therefore, this discrepancy is logically attributable to either some degree of viral inactivation on the mask surface, poor efficiency of the viral transfer from the mask surface to the finger, or a combination of the two. It might apply to the experiments using the coughing machine and sprays. Regarding the poor viral transfer efficiency from the mask surface, one may doubt the generalization of the result since our study was on only one brand of water-repellent surgical masks made of non-woven chemical fiber filters. However, there was a report that the transfer efficiency of a virus from the porous surface of the polyester fabric was also very poor at about 0.3%8.It is notable that despite the viral loads used in these transmission experiments being very high compared to real-world settings, there was still little or no transmission via fingertip swiping. In addition, even if a very small amount of the virus were transferred to the fingertip or hand, their viability would decrease rapidly9,10. Furthermore, the transmission of influenza via fingers is thought to occur by contact of the contaminated fingertip with the nasal mucosal membrane, but the low infection efficiency by such a nasal route was also seen in data from an efficacy study for the influenza drug, oseltamivir11. Therefore, based on these study results, the risk of viral transmission via this fingertip-mask surface-touching route appears extremely low—in contrast to commonly cited infection control guidance.While we agree that a ‘bundled’ approach to infection control may be effective in sending a single message of how to disinfect surfaces and maintain good hand hygiene, we believe that this can go too far, as was seen with the excesses of ‘hygiene theatre’ highlighted during the COVID-19 pandemic12. At least one other real-world study showed little or no external mask viral contamination13. Thus, that study, together with the results in this current study and the plausible mechanisms discussed to explain these findings, are likely applicable to other human respiratory viruses that are also substantially airborne14,15.This is not to say that hand-washing and fomite transmission precautions are not important. This study, together with another12, simply suggests that the risk of viral transmission via touching the surface of used masks is low.MethodsSurgical masks and experimental set-upWater-repellent surgical masks (Medical Mask CP, Taketora, Tokyo, Japan) are made of three sheets of non-woven chemical fiber filters. They were exposed to a variety of ‘source’ influenza virus aerosols/ droplets generated in different ways: (1) via a commercial electric nebulizer (NE-C28, Omron Healthcare, Kyoto, Japan) to simulate general environmental airborne virus contamination, including that generated from coughing and sneezing (particle sizes: 0.3–5 µm, Fig. S5); (2) a coughing machine simulating strong coughs, with exit particle velocities of 9 –12 m/s16 (AC100, Saika, Tokyo, Japan) (particle sizes: 0.1–100 µm, Fig. S6); and (3) larger droplets generated by carefully calibrated spray bottles to simulate occasional exposures of the mask surface to large droplets contained in droplets released by speaking, coughing, or sneezing from a short distance of 40 cm (approximate particle sizes: 100, 200, and 500 µm, Fig. S7)17. All experiments were performed within an air-tight environmental chamber (3.6 m long × 3.3m wide × 2m tall) or 1 m3 cube, at 20 °C and 20% relative humidity (RH), except the spraying experiments that were performed at 20 and 30 °C, and 20, 50 and 70% RH conditions.Simulations for human subject and exposureA ‘recipient’ (exposed) manikin head was connected to a ‘breathing’ machine (SN-480-3, Shinano, Tokyo) (0.5 L/breath, 15 breaths/min) and set as a simulation model of a human wearing a mask8 (Figs. 2, S1, S8). The idea was that any virus-laden aerosols would be pulled towards the outer mask surface and become trapped there during the inhalation-exhalation (breathing) cycle, which would then act as a source of contamination to any fingers subsequently touching this outer mask surface. For general environmental exposure to the nebulizer-generated aerosols, the viral fluid was atomized for 30 s, followed by mixing the chamber air. The masked manikin head was set to breathe for 30 min from the start of the atomization to inhale the aerosol with the virus through the mask. After this, a human finger (coauthor YF) that had been cleaned (in 70% W/V ethanol) and allowed to dry, was used to swipe a 2 cm × 2 cm central area of the outer surface of the mask (Fig. S2 b). This now ‘contaminated’ finger was then rinsed immediately for up to 20 s with 3 mL MEM (viral minimum essential media). This MEM was then used in a viral plaque assay to detect and quantify any viable virus. It was also used in a reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) assay to quantify any viral RNA present (Fig. S8).Fig. 2Apparatus and set-up for the breathing aerosol experiments.

Electric nebulizer used to generate the aerosols (b).Full size imageFinger-swiping experimentsFor the nebulizer experiments, where the manikin head was attached to the breathing machine, we also examined how much virus was present on the mask's outer surface that might be available to the finger swipe. For this, the 2cm x2cm central area of the mask that was not swiped by the finger as a control was also cut out, and its outer surface sheet was vortexed in RNA extraction buffer, which was then tested using the RT-PCR assay to directly quantify the amount of virus present (Fig. S8d). This same finger swiping and virus detection process, after the same 30-min delay, was repeated after the masked manikin head was exposed to the simulated coughing (five coughs, at 100 and 200 cm distance, expelling a total of 0.22 mL of viral fluid (Fig. S1b). For each new exposure distance, the manikin head was fitted with a new mask. The spraying experiments were performed at two temperatures (20 and 30 °C) and three different relative humidities (20, 50, and 70%) without connection to the breathing machine, with 2× spray puffs used for each particle size (100, 200, and 500 µm), from a distance of 40 cm distance, exposing the mask to a total of 0.08–0.25 mL of the viral fluid, containing up to a total of 107 pfu of virus (Fig. S9). For each new particle size, the manikin head was fitted with a new mask.Aerosol samplingAerosolized influenza viruses were collected into MEM using a sampling system consisting of an air sampler containing a gelatin filter (MD8 AirScan Sartorius AG, Göttingen, Germany)5. Air containing airborne virus was pulled through the filter by the breathing machine for a sampling time of 30 min. The gelatin filter (80 mm diameter) membrane was dissolved in 10 mL MEM and then subjected to conventional plaque or real-time RT-qPCR assay detection.Virus and cell cultureThe virus used in these experiments was influenza A/Aichi/2/68 (H3N2), which was propagated in the allantoic cavity of 10-day-old fertilized hens’ eggs and then stored at − 80 °C as the working viral fluid. The viable titer of the viral fluid was about 108 pfu/mL, and its protein concentration was about 10 mg/mL. Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were cultured in minimum essential medium (MEM; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MS, USA), 1.7% glucose, 100 unit/mL penicillin G (Meiji Co., Tokyo, Japan), and 100 µg/mL streptomycin, sub-cultured in 24 well-plates and used for the conventional plaque assay of the virus.Plaque assay of the virusBriefly, MDCK cells cultured in 24-well plates were inoculated with the viral sample and placed in a 5% CO2 incubator at 34 °C for 1 h, followed by washing with serum-free MEM, overlayed with MEM supplemented with 5 µg/mL trypsin and 0.8% agar, and kept in the incubator at 37 °C. After two days, the overlay was removed, and the cell layer was stained with 0.1% crystal violet in 20% methanol for plaque number counting.Viral RNA testingViral RNA was extracted from samples using the QIAamp viral RNA Mini Kits (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. A quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay was performed using PrimeScript One Step RT-PCR Kit Ver.2 (TaKaRa Bio, Shiga, Japan) with specific primers for RT-PCR designed for forward (5’-TAACCGAGGTCGAAACGTA-3’) and reverse (5’-GCACGGTGAGCGTGAA-3’) and probes targeting the matrix protein 1 (M1) gene18.All the experiments using the virus were performed at least twice, and averages of viral titers were shown in the graphs (Fig. 1a, b), except the spray experiments that were performed three times, and the averages and standard deviations were shown in the graph (Fig. 1c).

These institutions serve as key points of contact between WHO and its Member States for sustaining the global virological and epidemiological surveillance required to prepare for and respond effectively to epidemics and pandemics. Currently, 129 Member States have WHO-recognized NICs. NICs have a range of capacities, with some having only basic surveillance functions, while others have highly advanced capabilities to perform the full scale of analyses from detection to genetic characterization for surveillance and diagnostic purposes, as well as research functions. Maintaining and expanding these core capacities is one of the primary objectives of the WHO Global Influenza Programme (GIP) through the collaborative surveillance of GISRS. Considering the specific capacities and needs of different NICs, the GIP has developed this induction course in close collaboration with the WHO Collaborating Centres on influenza and partners.Scope and objectives GIP will conduct an in-person workshop for newly appointed directors of WHO-recognized NICs. The specific objectives of the meeting are to:Equip NIC directors with the necessary knowledge and skills to effectively carry out routine influenza surveillance, early warning, and response activities in the global context. Provide a comprehensive understanding of the role of NICs in sustaining global virological and epidemiological surveillance for responding to influenza epidemics and pandemics within the broader context of global and WHO initiatives, such as the Global Influenza Strategy, the International Health Regulations (2005), the Global Architecture for Health Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Resilience, and a mosaic of event-based surveillance and One Health coordination at the animal-human interface.Introduce the functions of the WHO Global Influenza Programme and its role in supporting NICs and global influenza surveillance efforts.AgendaGISRS’s roles and functions Influenza virology Surveillance overview Data and management Laboratory overview Zoonotic influenza and risk assessment Pandemic preparedness and the Pandemic Influenza Preparedness FrameworkParticipantsParticipants will represent directors or heads of the WHO-recognized NICs and National Focal Points for the epidemiological and virological surveillance of influenza from Ministries of Health, representatives from the WHO Collaborating Centres on Influenza and WHO Regional Office focal points on influenza.The working language of the workshop will be English.

The trials compared the effects of the direct-acting flu antivirals on death rates and length of hospital stay with placebo, standard care, or other antivirals.These findings primarily highlight the uncertainty regarding effects of antivirals for treatment of patients with severe influenza but do provide some justification for their use.The eight trials included in the systematic review involved 1,424 participants with an average age of 36 to 60 years, 79% to 100% of whom had confirmed flu. Six of the trials were included in the meta-analysis. The studied drugs were oseltamivir (brand name, Tamiflu), peramivir (Rapivab), zanamivir (Relenza), rimantadine (Flumadine), zanamivir plus rimantadine, and baloxavir (Xofluza) plus neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir, or peramivir)."Hospitalised patients with seasonal influenza can develop complications, including severe pneumonia, respiratory failure, multi-organ failure, and secondary bacterial infections, that can lead to death," the researchers wrote. "Therefore, identifying effective therapies for severe influenza is of global public health importance." The effects of the use of oseltamivir, peramivir, or zanamivir relative to placebo or standard care for the treatment of seasonal and zoonotic flu on death were very uncertain. Similarly, the strength of evidence that oseltamivir or peramivir shortened hospital stays for seasonal flu was low (average difference, –1.63 and –1.73 days, respectively). Compared with standard care, there was little or no difference in time to symptom relief with oseltamivir (0.34 days) or peramivir (–0.05 day), both with low-certainty evidence. The rate of adverse events or serious adverse events with oseltamivir, peramivir, and zanamivir were comparable (very low certainty). The researchers said that oseltamivir or peramivir may shorten hospital stays but that uncertainty is high regarding the effects of oseltamivir, peramivir, or zanamivir on admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) and death from severe seasonal or zoonotic flu."The effects of all antivirals on mortality and other important patient outcomes are very uncertain due to scarce data from randomised controlled trials," the authors wrote. "These findings primarily highlight the uncertainty regarding effects of antivirals for treatment of patients with severe influenza but do provide some justification for their use. More clinical trials of antivirals are needed to inform the clinical benefit, safety, and effects on antiviral resistance in patients with severe influenza."The systematic review provided the evidence base for updated WHO clinical recommendations on the use of antivirals to treat severe flu.Role in preventing seasonal, zoonotic flu dragana991 / iStock The second systematic review and meta-analysis, conducted by the same research team to support updated WHO flu guidelines, assessed the use of neuraminidase inhibitors for post-exposure prophylaxis, or prevention (PEP) for seasonal and zoonotic flu in RCTs published up to September 20, 2023. The study included 33 trials of the antivirals zanamivir, oseltamivir, laninamivir (Inavir), baloxavir, amantadine (Symmetrel), and rimantadine that enrolled 19,096 participants total with an average age of 7 to 81 years."Although previous systematic reviews have found that antivirals (oseltamivir or zanamivir) are effective in preventing symptomatic influenza, these reviews assessed selected antivirals and did not rate the quality of evidence or consider the importance of effects in their interpretation," the study authors noted. "Additionally, a randomised controlled trial of baloxavir for influenza post-exposure prophylaxis was not included in previous reviews."The researchers concluded that post-exposure use of zanamivir, oseltamivir, laninamivir, and baloxavir probably reduces symptomatic flu rates in patients at high risk for severe illness (zanamivir risk ratio, 0.35; oseltamivir, 0.40; laninamivir, 0.43; baloxavir, 0·43; moderate certainty) when given within 48 hours after exposure to seasonal flu. These antivirals, however, probably don't appreciably reduce rates of symptomatic flu in patients at low risk of severe flu when given soon after exposure (moderate certainty), they said. Prompt administration of zanamivir, oseltamivir, laninamivir, or baloxavir may lessen symptomatic zoonotic flu in people exposed to novel influenza A viruses tied to severe infection (low certainty). Oseltamivir, laninamivir, baloxavir, and amantadine likely lower the risk of symptomatic and asymptomatic infection (moderate certainty), but zanamivir, oseltamivir, laninamivir, and baloxavir probably don't do much—if anything—to prevent asymptomatic flu or reduce all-cause death rates (high or moderate certainty). Oseltamivir likely has little or no effect on hospitalization rates (moderate certainty), and none of the studied antivirals significantly raise the incidence of drug-related adverse events or serious adverse events (varied strength of evidence).The findings "support use of zanamivir, oseltamivir, laninamivir, or baloxavir for post-exposure prophylaxis of seasonal influenza in individuals at high risk of severe influenza, and also provide some support for the use of these antivirals for post-exposure prophylaxis of zoonotic influenza," but "do not support using these antivirals among low-risk populations for post-exposure prophylaxis of seasonal influenza and do not support the use of amantadine or rimantadine for preventing symptomatic influenza A virus infection," the researchers concluded.Ongoing trials may soon provide answersIn a related commentary on both Lancet studies, David Hui, MBBS, MD, of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said many knowledge gaps remain on the role of antivirals in the prevention and treatment of flu. "More randomised controlled trial data are needed on antiviral treatment of patients with non-severe or severe zoonotic disease, the role of combination antiviral treatment and immunomodulators for severe seasonal or zoonotic influenza, and post-exposure prophylaxis dosing of different neuraminidase inhibitors or baloxavir against zoonotic influenza," he wrote. "Ongoing and large-scale multicentre randomised controlled trials such as the REMAP-CAP12 and the RECOVERY trial platforms might provide answers to some of these gaps in the near future."Delayed antiviral therapy tied to poor pneumonia outcomes Yudram_TA / iStock For the third study, published last week in Clinical Infectious Diseases, a US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-led research team assessed the risk of death among 26,233 hospitalized adult flu patients in the CDC's multistate Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET) and a diagnosis of pneumonia at hospital release over the 2012 through 2019 flu seasons. Nearly all patients (99.7%) were given oseltamivir.The team assessed the three treatment groups based on the initiation of antivirals after admission (day 0 [60.9%], day 1 [29.5%], and days 2 to 5 [9.7%]) and used logistic regression models to evaluate the link between delayed treatment and all-cause death at 30 days. Median age was 71 years, and 92.2% had a chronic condition that didn't affect their immune system."While most U.S. adults hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed influenza receive antiviral treatment, timing of initiation may vary based on when a patient seeks care after illness onset, availability of influenza test results, and clinical suspicion for influenza, among other factors," the investigators wrote.In total, 29.1% of patients were admitted to an ICU, 13.1% required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), and 8.0% died within 30 days. The percentage of patients who experienced each severe outcome rose with each additional day from admission to treatment initiation.Delayed initiation of antiviral treatment in patients hospitalized with influenza-associated pneumonia was associated with higher risk of death, highlighting the importance of timely initiation of antiviral treatment at admission.Relative to those who started an antiviral on day 0, those starting on day 5 were much more likely to be admitted to an ICU (58.5% vs 26.6%), receive IMV (40.2% vs 11.7%), or die within 30 days (19.5% vs 7.5%).Death by 30 days occurred in 7.5%, 8.5%, and 10.2% of patients who began taking antivirals on days 0, 1, and 2 to 5, respectively. Compared to those treated on day 0, the adjusted odds ratio for those who started antivirals on day 1 and on days 2 to 5 were 1.14 and 1.40, respectively."Delayed initiation of antiviral treatment in patients hospitalized with influenza-associated pneumonia was associated with higher risk of death, highlighting the importance of timely initiation of antiviral treatment at admission," the authors wrote.

CDC will update this outlook every two months throughout the season and as warranted by changes in the trajectories of any of the three diseases. Overview Update‎ See our October Update to the Season Outlook CDC expects the upcoming fall and winter respiratory disease season will likely have a similar or lower number of combined peak hospitalizations due to COVID-19, influenza, and RSV compared to last season. This outlook is intended to provide decision-makers with information to assist in public health preparedness for respiratory virus illnesses during the 2024-2025 fall and winter respiratory season, such as when hospitals might experience the most demand. Our assessments are based on expert opinion, historical data, and scenario modeling conducted by the Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics for COVID-19, influenza, and RSV. As with all long-range scenarios, there is inherent uncertainty, which we describe below. View Larger Figure 1: Experts believe there's a roughly 80% chance that the hospitalization burden for COVID-19, influenza, and RSV combined at their peak during the 2024-25 season will be similar to or lower than last season. The 2017-18 bar provides context for a severe season pre-pandemic; 2017-18 RSV data does not include pediatric hospitalizations. Data are from RESP-NET.Show More For this seasonal outlook, CDC defined three potential scenarios for the combined peak hospitalization burden of COVID-19, influenza, and RSV for the 2024-2025 respiratory season (Table 1). We then consulted a range of CDC and external experts on COVID-19, influenza, RSV, and disease forecasting to assess the likelihood of each scenario and provide associated confidence levels. The experts estimated there's a roughly 80% chance that peak combined hospitalization burden will be similar to or lower than last season, with low confidence (Figure 1, Table 1). Table 1. Scenarios for combined peak hospitalization burden for COVID-19, influenza, and RSV Scenario relative to 2023-2024 Definition Percentage chance estimated by experts Similar peak The combined peak hospitalization burden for the 2024-2025 season will be similar (within +/- 20%) to the combined peak burden for the 2023-2024 respiratory season. 54% Lower peak The combined peak hospitalization burden for the 2024-2025 season will be substantially lower (at least 20%) than that of the 2023-2024 respiratory season. 28% Higher peak The combined peak hospitalization burden for the 2024-2025 season will be substantially higher (at least 20%) than that of the 2023-2024 respiratory season. 18% Factors that could lead to higher peak hospitalization rate While we expect this season's peak hospitalization rate will be similar to or lower than last year, there is still a risk of a higher peak rate, underscoring the need to consider this possibility in planning and preparedness activities. The following factors could drive higher peak rate: Emergence of a new COVID-19 variant with an increased ability to evade the body's prior immunity, or a new COVID-19 variant associated with higher clinical severity. Predominance of an influenza subtype with more severe outcomes. Lower vaccine uptake or effectiveness, including: If there is lower than projected uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine, influenza seasonal vaccine, or RSV vaccines and immunizations. If the updated 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization is lower than that of the 2023-2024 vaccine. If influenza seasonal vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization is lower than projected. COVID-19 outlook CDC projects that the peak weekly hospitalization rate due to COVID-19 will be similar to or lower than that of the 2023-2024 seasonA with moderate confidence. COVID-19 activity this fall and winter will depend on the progression of the ongoing summer COVID-19 wave. Therefore, we developed two different COVID-19 hospitalization burden scenarios for the 2024-2025 respiratory season to demonstrate the range of possibilities for how this season could unfold (Figure 2). Our two scenarios are based on inferred COVID-19 weekly hospitalizations for the summer using two different surveillance systems: hospitalization data for a relatively small subset of hospitals (Scenario A) or emergency department visit data (Scenario B)B. If COVID-19 activity continues to increase and does not peak before the start of the fall and winter respiratory virus season (October to April), modeling indicates that the wave may peak early during the respiratory season—with a peak weekly COVID-19 hospitalization rate between 7.2 and 9.7 hospitalizations per 100,000 occurring in late December (Scenario A, Figure 2). However, if the current COVID-19 summer wave peaks before the respiratory season begins, modeling suggests a second, smaller wave could occur during the respiratory season, with a peak weekly COVID-19 hospitalization rate between 4.2 and 5.8 hospitalizations per 100,000 occurring in mid-January (Scenario B, Figure 2). The peak COVID-19 hospitalization rate for both scenarios is lower than that of last season. A lower peak hospitalization burden due to COVID-19 could lead to a lower overall combined peak hospitalization burden during the 2024-2025 respiratory season. We assumed that variants will emerge with similar properties to those that drove last winter's peak, and that the 2024-2025 vaccine will have similar uptake and performance as last year's vaccine. The potential impact of vaccination could change based on the timing and size of the winter peak. While our model can also be used to evaluate the impact of interventions such as vaccinations, given the uncertainty in the impact of the current summer wave, we chose instead to focus on these two different COVID-19 hospitalization burden scenarios for the 2024-2025 season. View Larger Figure 2. CDC scenario modeling indicates if summer activity peaks later, we will see a higher peak COVID-19 hospitalization burden during the respiratory season. Dashed lines represent inferred COVID-19 hospitalization rates for the summer, using hospitalization data for a relatively small subset of hospitals (Scenario A) or emergency department visit data (Scenario B). Ribbons represent 50% prediction interval range of scenario modeling results. The model is calibrated to NHSN data (historical COVID-19 hospitalizations line in figure).Show More Influenza outlook CDC projects the peak hospitalization rate due to influenza will be similar to or lower than that of the 2023-2024 season rate of 8.9 weekly laboratory-confirmed hospitalizations per 100,000, with moderate confidence. However, past seasons have varied widely in the number of illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths, depending on the subtypes circulating, population immunity to different subtypes, and vaccine effectiveness against circulating subtypes. Vaccination will play a key role in preventing hospital admissions due to influenza during the respiratory season. Experts estimate, with moderate confidence, that effectiveness of the seasonal influenza vaccine against hospitalization will likely be between 33% and 50%—within the range of vaccine effectiveness observed in recent seasons. Experts estimate the vaccine will likely be between 42% and 55% for adults 18 and older, which we have designated as low and high vaccine uptake, respectively. Assuming a vaccine effectiveness of 41%C modeling estimates that 21% of hospitalizations would be prevented with high vaccine uptake compared to a scenario without any vaccine uptake, while 16% would be prevented with low vaccine uptake. RSV outlook CDC projects that the peak weekly hospitalization rate across all age groups due to RSV will be similar to or lower than that of the 2023-2024 season level of 4.2 weekly laboratory-confirmed hospitalizations per 100,000, with moderate confidence. We expect the RSV season to fall within normal seasonal patterns. Early uptake of new RSV vaccines and immunizations will play a key role in preventing hospital admissions due to RSV during the respiratory season. Experts estimate, with moderate confidence, that for older adults, effectiveness of RSV vaccination against hospitalization will likely be between 73% and 88%, and that uptake of the vaccines will likely be up to 35%. Assuming a vaccine effectiveness of 80% for adults 65 and overD, modeling indicates 25% of hospitalizations of older adults would be prevented with high vaccine uptake, compared to a scenario without any vaccine uptake, while 19% would be prevented with low vaccine uptakeE. To consider the role of immunization in preventing hospitalizations of infants less than one year old, experts estimated, with moderate confidence, effectiveness and uptake of RSV immunization (nirsevimab) and maternal RSV vaccinationF. Assuming an RSV immunization effectiveness of 90% and a maternal RSV vaccination effectiveness of 64%D, modeling indicates 76% of hospitalizations of infants would be prevented with high uptake, compared to a scenario without any uptake, while 43% would be prevented with low uptake.

Key Uncertainties & Methods Key Uncertainties This outlook is a high-level assessment intended to provide scenarios for how the 2024-2025 respiratory season could unfold; it is not a precise forecast. We have noted several areas of uncertainty for specific diseases in sections above, including related to vaccination and circulating viral variants and subtypes. Additional uncertainties include the following: It is difficult to predict the size and timing of peak activity for each disease, as well as how the timing might overlap. Experts agree that some level of overlap in peak hospitalization burden may occur. These factors will affect the level of demand on the healthcare system. We note that while peak hospitalization rate is a key factor, cumulative burden can also impact hospital demand throughout the season. The virus that causes COVID-19 is constantly changing, and a new variant could emerge that is less effectively mitigated by immunity from past infections or from existing vaccines and treatments. COVID-19 occurs at meaningful levels throughout the year with periodic epidemics, which can vary in timing and magnitude. Avian influenza A (H5N1) is widespread in wild birds globally and is causing outbreaks in poultry and U.S. dairy cows, with several recent human cases in U.S. dairy and poultry workers. The current risk to the general public posed by the avian influenza A (H5N1) virus presently spreading in cows, poultry, and other mammals remains low. Particularly for RSV, estimates are less precise for the burden of illnesses and hospitalizations in past seasons which limits our ability to anticipate trends for this respiratory season. Immunization uptake is also less certain because RSV immunization for older adults, for pregnant people, and for infants and young children were recommended last year for the first time. Methods This outlook is based on expert opinion, historical data, and scenario modeling for COVID-19, influenza, and RSV. We have low to moderate combined confidence in our assessment. This respiratory outlook incorporates expert opinion from 19 subject-matter experts specializing in COVID-19, influenza, and RSV epidemiology, infectious disease modeling, disease surveillance, and risk assessment methods. In partnership with Metaculus, CDC designed a questionnaire and process for soliciting views from experts on the upcoming fall and winter respiratory season. Experts each answered a series of questions on the expected hospitalization burden posed by each disease, as well as on key drivers for a season with a higher peak hospitalization rate. After experts submitted initial responses to the questionnaire, CDC and Metaculus convened a workshop to discuss results and any key areas of disagreement. Experts were then allowed to update their responses, if desired. The final results were used to inform this Respiratory Disease Season Outlook and as inputs into scenario modeling. Our Behind the Model article features more detail on our modeling methods.

Experts were asked to estimate a 50% confidence interval for influenza vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization during the 2024-2025 respiratory season. The aggregate vaccine effectiveness estimates were calculated as the medians of the lower and upper bounds provided by experts. We used the midpoint (41%) of the median lower bound and median upper bound as an input for our scenario modeling. Experts were asked to estimate a 50% confidence interval for RSV vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization during the 2024-2025 respiratory season. The aggregate vaccine effectiveness estimates were calculated as the medians of the lower and upper bounds provided by experts. We used the midpoint of the median lower bound and median upper bound as an input for our scenario modeling. We used a vaccine uptake value of 24% for the low uptake scenario, to align with RSV vaccination uptake for older adults during the 2023-2024 respiratory season (24%). Experts estimate, with moderate confidence, that for infants, effectiveness of RSV immunization (nirsevimab) against hospitalization will likely be between 85% and 95%, and that uptake of immunization will likely be between 38% and 63%. In addition, experts estimate that effectiveness of maternal RSV vaccination against hospitalization for infants within 3 months of birth will likely be between 55% and 74% and that uptake of vaccination for eligible pregnant persons will be between 15% and 30%.

To minimize the risk of such human infections, interventions should be implemented to reduce human exposure to birds and mammals potentially infected with avian or other animal influenza viruses. It is recommended that national authorities conduct scientific investigations and enhanced surveillance to monitor, understand the extent of, and assess the risk among occupationally exposed individuals, including those with or without clinical signs and/or symptoms, and provide appropriate clinical management. This interim guidance will be updated as more information becomes available.

The last detection in Michigan was on July 26, also in Van Buren County. The detection brings the number of affected dairy herds in Michigan to 28, and samples have been sent to the US Department of Agriculture's (USDA) National Veterinary Services Laboratories for additional confirmatory testing, according to the Michigan Department of Agriculture & Rural Development.According to state rules, the detection will now prohibit the exhibition of all lactating dairy cattle, and those in the last 2 months of pregnancy, until there are no new cases of HPAI in Michigan dairy cattle for at least 60 consecutive days.In the past 30 days, 5 states have reported 20 cases of HPAI in dairy cattle, according to the USDA. The most recent previous detections were in Colorado and Idaho. Study suggests antibodies to flu common in raptors In other avian flu news, a preprint study of raptors from the University of Minnesota's Raptor Center and the Hawk Ridge Bird Observatory in Duluth during the 2022-23 H5N1 avian flu outbreak finds that 69.1% of bald eagles were seropositive for influenza virus, and 52 of 67 (77.6%) of them tested positive for antibodies to both H5 and N1.The study, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, offers new insight on the seroprevalence of influenza viruses in wild birds. According to the authors, the prevalence of influenza antibodies observed in this study was higher than reported from raptors sampled in this same region in 2012 C difficile vaccine candidate fails to meet primary end point in phase 3 trial News brief Chris Dall, MA Topics Antimicrobial Stewardship Clostridium difficile Jennifer Oosthuizen / CDC A Clostridioides difficile vaccine candidate was safe, well tolerated, and reduced C difficile infection (CDI) severity but did not reduce incidence of CDI in at-risk adults, according to the results of a phase 3 randomized clinical trial published late last week in Clinical Infectious Diseases.The global, phase 3 CLOVER trial, conducted in 23 countries from March 2017 through December 2021, assessed the efficacy of PF-06425090, a genetically detoxified toxin C difficile vaccine candidate from Pfizer, in adults 50 and older who were considered at increased CDI risk. Overall, 17,535 participants (mean age, 68; 51.5% female; 79.2% White) were randomized to receive three doses of PF-06425090 or placebo. The primary end points were the first CDI episode 14 or more days post–dose three (PD3) and post–dose two (PD2). CDI duration, need for CDI-related medical attention, and antibiotic use PD3 were also evaluated.Among the participants who received all three doses, 17 PF-06425090 and 25 placebo recipients had a primary CDI episode 14 or more days PD3, resulting in vaccine efficacy (VE) of 31%, but the 96.4% confidence interval ranged well below 0. Among those who received two doses, 24 PF-06425090 and 34 placebo recipients had a first CDI episode 14 or more days PD2, for a VE of 28.6%, with a similarly wide confidence interval. Median CDI duration was lower with PF-06425090 (1 day) versus placebo (4 days). Of participants with a first CDI episode, 0 PF-06425090 and 11 placebo recipients sought CDI-related medical attention (post-hoc analysis estimated VE, 100%) and 0 PF-06425090 and 10 placebo recipients required antibiotic treatment (VE, 100%). Local reactions were more frequent in PF-06425090 recipients, while systemic events, most of which were mild-to-moderate, were generally similar between groups. Adverse event rates were similar between groups.Potential public health benefitThe trial investigators say that while the primary end point wasn't met, the results suggest PF-06425090 could provide a public health benefit."Together, these findings suggest PF-06425090 may reduce overall disease burden by potentially reducing CDI severity in vaccine recipients and consequent need for medical interventions," trial investigators wrote. "Limiting need for medical attention not only alleviates healthcare resource strains but reduces potential for antibiotic exposure, which may help mitigate increasing global threats of antimicrobial resistance." Massachusetts to start spraying for Eastern equine encephalitis News brief Chris Dall, MA Topics Eastern Equine Encephalitis West Nile D Sikes / Flickr cc Massachusetts officials over the weekend announced plans to start spraying for mosquitoes in two counties to reduce the risk from eastern equine encephalitis (EEE). Officials from the Massachusetts Department of Health (DPH) and the Massachusetts Department of Agricultural Resources said they will conduct aerial spraying in parts of Plymouth County and truck-mounted spraying in parts of Worcester County to target mosquitoes carrying the virus. On August 16, the DPH reported the state's first EEE case since 2020, in a man in his 80s who was exposed in Worcester County.EEE is a rare but serious mosquito-borne illness that can lead to severe neurologic complications and potentially be fatal. In the 2019-20 EEE outbreak in Massachusetts, 17 cases and 7 deaths were reported."We have not seen an outbreak of EEE for four years in Massachusetts," DPH Commissioner Robbie Goldstein, MD, PhD, said in a DPH press release. "This year's outbreak and activity raise the risk for communities in parts of the state. We need to use all our available tools to reduce risk and protect our communities."DPH officials are also advising residents of high-risk areas to schedule outdoor activities to avoid dusk-to-dawn hours to minimize exposure to the mosquitoes most likely to carry EEE.West Nile virus also a concernIn a separate press release, the DPH said eight municipalities are now to be considered at high risk from another mosquito-borne illness—West Nile virus (WNV). The first WNV-positive mosquitoes in Massachusetts were announced on July 2. "We are finding evidence of West Nile virus in mosquitoes in multiple parts of the Commonwealth," Goldstein said. "While most people do not get severely ill from WNV, it is still important to take it seriously."The elevated risk level applies to Boston in Suffolk County and Abington, Brockton, East Bridgewater, Marion, Mattapoisett, Rochester, and Whitman in Plymouth County. Efforts to reduce antimicrobial resistance in low-resource nations are lagging, survey suggests News brief Chris Dall, MA Topics Antimicrobial Stewardship A survey of public health experts from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) highlights significant gaps in implementation and enforcement of policies aimed at mitigating antimicrobial resistance (AMR), researchers reported late last week in BMC Public Health.The Global Survey of Experts on Antimicrobial Resistance (GSEAR), developed by researchers with the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute and University of Basel, was sent to public health experts in 138 LMICs to assess their countries' efforts to address AMR. The main areas covered by the survey were existence of AMR national action plans (NAPs), policies and interventions to restrict the sale and consumption of antibiotics, current antibiotic use, antibiotic prescribing practices, collection and reporting of surveillance data, and AMR awareness.A total of 352 surveys from 118 LMICs were analyzed. Experts in 67% of the surveyed countries reported a NAP on AMR, 64% reported legislative policies on antimicrobial use, 58% reported national training programs for health professionals, and 10% reported national monitoring systems for antimicrobials. Fifty-one percent of LMICs had specific targeted policies to limit the sale and use of protected or reserve antibiotics. While 72% of LMICs had prescription requirements for accessing antibiotics, getting antibiotics without a prescription was reported to be possible in 74% of LMICs. Government officials may overestimate policy coverageWhen the researchers compared the GSEAR results to the 2020-21 World Health Organization–organized Tripartite AMR Country Self-Assessment Survey (TrACSS), which was completed by government officials in 113 LMICs, they found substantial disagreement. For example, TrACCS results indicated 86% had NAPs and 86% had legislative policies on antimicrobial use. Based on expert perspectives, there are significant gaps in current policy and implementation efforts to address AMR in LMICs, with a large number of countries falling short of target achievements.The authors say that while the experts consulted in the GSEAR survey may not always be aware of NAPs and specific policies and programs in their respective countries, the gaps between the GSEAR at TrACSS responses suggests countries may be overestimating their efforts."Based on expert perspectives, there are significant gaps in current policy and implementation efforts to address AMR in LMICs, with a large number of countries falling short of target achievements; current policy coverage may be substantially lower than what the TrACSS survey suggests," the authors wrote. India reports largest Chandipura virus outbreak in 2 decades News brief Lisa Schnirring Topics Misc Emerging Topics India has reported a surge in Chandipura virus infections this summer, with 245 acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) cases reported since July, with 82 of them fatal. So far, polymerase chain reaction testing has confirmed the virus in 64 cases, the World Health Organization (WHO) said in an August 23 outbreak announcement. Insect vectors include sandflies. USDA/Stephen Ausmus/Flickr cc Chandipura virus is endemic in India, and it is known to trigger sporadic cases and outbreaks of AES in western, southern, and central part of the country, especially during monsoon season. Outbreaks typically occur every 4 to 5 years in Gujarat state. The virus—a member of the Rhabdoviridae family—is transmitted by vectors that include sandflies, mosquitoes, and ticks.Children most affected; fast onset of severe symptomsThe disease mainly affects children ages 15 and younger. The main symptoms are fever, with coma and convulsions that can occur within 48 to 72 hours of symptoms onset.Cases began rising in early June, and 43 of 806 districts in India have reported AES cases. Of the 64 confirmed cases, 61 were in Gujarat state and 3 in Rajasthan state. The WHO said cases have been declining since the middle of July. Though authorities have deployed control strategies, further transmission is possible in the coming weeks, given favorable conditions from the monsoon season in affected areas.India's last large Chandipura virus occurred in 2003, when 329 suspected cases, 183 of them fatal, were reported in Andhra Pradesh state. The virus has been detected only in India, but the WHO said it may be present in other countries in Asia and Africa. The sandfly vector is present in Southeast Asia.

Now, there’s a film, officially documenting the faith in humanity in Montana, and it's making stops at theaters statewide, including Crow Agency and Missoula in September 2024.“You could imagine it would have been very traumatic for people. You’d have cases where you would go to a house, and there might be a dead child in the house and the other members are there, and they are too sick to do anything with the body, and then if one or two parents die. You have children orphaned as a result of the pandemic,” says Leif Fredrickson, a historian featured in the documentary.It’s a film that sucks viewers into the flu that literally turned faces blue before a person died. A dramatic history, one the director says is often brushed over in classrooms.The documentary is called Blue Death: The 1918 Influenza in Montana."We chose six individual stories where Montanans are telling how it affected them and how they tried to help each other survive,” says Dee Garceau, the documentary’s producer and director.Like the recent Covid-19 pandemic, masks were worn and schools shut down.“Public officials are asking teachers who are now out of work, well, hey, you're not working, we want you to volunteer as nurses, and the reason for this was that most healthcare workers were overseas serving in World War I," Garceau said.The film documents the life of a part-Crow woman named Francis, a teacher who dies trying to nurse others back to health.“As a commenter, I had Reno Charette, who is Crow and Northern Cheyenne, and Reno is a historian. and so she helped create a context for Francis Garriga's story,” says Garceau.“Epidemics take away the people you love, and they take away history and language and your ceremonies, because the important people that knew that information had not had that opportunity to transfer it to the younger person as it should have been done,” says Charette, a historian.Luckily via the film, family history is being preserved from a time similar to recent years, yet far advanced when it comes to vaccines vs. shots of whiskey and wishing for the best.All Montanans have the chance to view it either on its statewide tour next in Missoula Sept. 10 at the public library or Sept. 19 in Crow Agency at the Little Big Horn Community College, or online via Montana PBS.

Young horses, age one to five, are generally most susceptible. Older horses may have some immunity if they encountered the virus in the past. INFLUENZA OUTBREAKS Thomas Chambers, PhD, Reference Laboratory for Equine Influenza, at the Gluck Equine Research Center, University of Kentucky is part of an international expert surveillance panel for equine influenza. “The panel meets every year to review the situation for the previous year,” Chambers said. “One of the curious features about outbreaks is that their pattern is different in different parts of the world, and it seems to be associated with vaccination. In the U.S. there is a certain proportion of the equine population that gets vaccinated, and the disease is enzootic—which means it is always around, at a low level,” he said. Horses in the U.S. are likely to be exposed to this disease at some point. “We generally don’t see huge outbreaks. We see a few outbreaks at racetracks, or at a veterinary hospital, that affect a small number of horses before they get it under control.” These are small sporadic outbreaks, generally localized, although traveling horses can carry the virus and start another outbreak. “This is what we’ve seen in the U.S. for a long time. By contrast, some countries have a very different pattern. India, for example has huge outbreaks–many thousands of horses–and afterward the disease disappears for 10 years or so. Then they have another huge outbreak, followed by another long period of quiet,” Chambers said. “They don’t routinely vaccinate in India, so probably when they have a huge outbreak, just about every horse is exposed, and develops some immunity. This ‘herd immunity’ apparently stays in place for several years after. This seems to keep the lid on the disease for a period of time, even without vaccination.” Herd immunity eventually wears off and then there’s another big outbreak. “Here in North America we have a few low-level outbreaks–nothing dramatic. It’s only been in the last eight years that vaccines have caught up with recommendations we made in 2010—that vaccines should contain both the Clade 1 and Clade 2 strains. Since the Florida Clade 2 strains circulate elsewhere (primarily in Europe) and because there is international horse traffic, we can’t expect that we only have to worry about Clade 1,” he said. “Dr. Nicola Pusterla at the University of California at Davis identified some imported horses that were infected with the Clade 2. Fortunately they were quarantined, and the disease was caught before these horses could start any outbreaks in the U.S. But at some point there will probably be re-introduction of Clade 2, so owners and practitioners should use vaccines with updated virus strains.” PREVENTING INFLUENZA Chambers suggests testing for the virus if you have a sick horse with fever, cough and nasal discharge (typical signs of respiratory disease). “Try to get the horse swabbed [to test] as soon as possible and get the swab sent to a diagnostic laboratory. Do it as soon as you notice that the horse is sick. The longer you put it off, the poorer the sample will become. A test for the virus won’t be as sensitive.” It’s also important to keep good vaccination records—the date when each horse is vaccinated, and with what product. “We need the specific product, not just the name of the company. The big manufacturers today market various products, not just the equine flu vaccine, but maybe five different kinds of flu vaccine, in different combinations with other vaccines. One type may be in combination with herpes, or tetanus, or Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE) and Western Equine Encephalitis (WEE), and some combinations with West Nile. So record not just the date and vaccine company, but also which specific product was used.” Vaccine is just one tool, since disease prevention is more complex than simply vaccinating. Biosecurity is also crucial, to keep disease out of a farm. “Some biosecurity procedures are simple, such as just washing your hands. It’s also helpful to quarantine new arrivals until you are sure they are not infected. Quarantine can be your first defense against introduction of disease. Other practices like not using the same grooming tools, water buckets, etc. with multiple horses, are also helpful. Viruses, especially influenza, transmit easily from horse to horse and it doesn’t have to be direct nose-to-nose contact. The virus can be passed to another horse on grooming tools, or by someone using an endoscope on multiple horses without disinfecting it in between,” Chambers said. It is easy to transmit disease, and also easy to kill this virus by disinfecting things between horses. “Soap and water will kill the influenza virus, as will laundry detergent, bleach, Lysol, etc. It generally doesn’t last a long time in the environment but maybe lasts longer than we originally thought. We used to think it only lasts a few hours, but now we realize it may last a few days, or in some circumstances (shielded from heat and direct sunlight) it might last weeks,” he explains. “Maybe 90% of it is dead within a few hours, but it could take much longer to kill that last 10%.” If a sick horse coughed into the hay or bedding, and another horse came along the next day or so and noses around in that hay or bedding, there might be risk. Aliza Simeone, VMD (Director of Biosecurity and Assistant Professor of Clinical Infectious Diseases and Biosecurity, University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine, New Bolton Center) says this disease shows up more often in winter, just as it does in other species and in people. “It is spread by infectious droplets. When sick horses cough, they cough out a lot of the virus and it can also travel in drops of mucus or saliva. It can be transmitted directly to another equine or spread on hands that haven’t been washed, or clothing that’s been ‘snotted’ on by a horse,” she said. “Simple steps like washing hands or using a good alcohol-based hand sanitizer between horses are effective. Avoid having to put your hands in horses’ mouths. I did some work at Thoroughbred tracks before starting my present job, and was happy to see how much more we are doing identification with microchips so we don’t need hands in mouths all the time to check tattoos,” she said. “I recommend routine temperature-taking, especially for horses that move around a lot or are in heavy work, or stabled at racetracks or traveling to races. The more often we check temperature (usually once or twice a day is adequate) the sooner we know if something is going on. We may not know what it is, but the start of a fever can enable us to get that horse away from the others and keep a closer eye.” Incubation period with influenza is short—just a few days—and a horse might be already shedding virus before showing signs or before it tests positive. TREATMENT AND RECOVERY Most horses recover with basic supportive care. “If they have a high fever, your veterinarian may suggest medication to reduce fever and making sure they stay hydrated, and taking them out of work (full rest) to aid recovery,” Simeone said. “The trainer shouldn’t continue working that horse when it is sick, and for several weeks after,” she says. That kind of stress will slow their recovery and won’t benefit their training if they are having trouble breathing. “There can be cases that are very mild, with just a day or two of extra nasal discharge. In some cases the horses don’t appear sick at all, or mild signs are overlooked, but these horses are still able to spread the virus,” Simeone said. How long a horse might shed the virus depends on that horse’s own immunity. “Some will shed for a shorter time than others, but to stay within the window of safety we generally give a recovered horse a two-week period before it comes in contact with other horses. The recovered horse may still be coughing even after it is no longer shedding the virus.” This is similar to a person who has recovered from a cold but is still coughing and may still have decreased lung capacity, but that person is no longer contagious. RESEARCH “We are always interested in improving vaccines,” Chambers said. “My lab has done work on various new technologies over the years. There isn’t anything right now that will totally replace conventional vaccines; they do work, if they are given on the proper schedule. If you keep horses regularly boosted, the conventional vaccines work, and are simple,” Chambers said. “Practitioners like the fact that they can just give a shot in the neck, and horses are fairly used to getting shot in the neck. There are alternatives, and we’ve done a lot of work on some of those alternatives (such as intranasal vaccines) and in some respects we think they work better,” he says. “Future vaccines may be different, however. In the human field there’s been a lot of work on what is called a universal vaccine (against the basic virus itself rather than the various strains). Within a few years we may be looking at a universal influenza vaccine. We need to make sure it is effective, however,” Chambers said. “If it works, we would not need to worry about updating the virus strains. A universal vaccine induces the horse to make antibodies that will neutralize the virus—but not by attacking the specific strain. The virus has a defense of always changing, and the idea is to not go after those changes, but attack the virus itself. ” he says. VACCINES There are several types of vaccines available—inactivated (killed virus) products administered intramuscularly, the modified live virus intranasal vaccine, and the canary pox vector vaccine which is administered intramuscularly. “I think an influenza virus vaccine administrated by the intranasal route should be very effective because it should mimic the immune response that the actual influenza infection stimulus,” says Chambers. “In particular it should give good local protection in the nasal mucosa which is the route of entry for infection.” An intranasal vaccine has some advantages but other vaccine types have their own advantages. “The conventional vaccines work, if you keep horses regularly boosted,” he says. It is important to follow label directions regarding administration, boosters, and vaccination schedules.

(WTOC) - The Coastal Health District is preparing for updated COVID and flu vaccines this fall.The district is preparing for the start of respiratory virus season with a shipment of updated COVID and influenza vaccines to all of their health departments. They are expected to be at health departments in September.“Our health departments will offer COVID vaccinations again as soon as we have the updated vaccine in stock,” said Paige Lightsey, immunization program coordinator for the Coastal Health District. “We also expect this year’s influenza vaccine in September, and we encourage everyone to make plans to get both vaccinations this fall.”Vaccinations for COVID and influenza can be given at the same time and are recommended for everyone aged 6 months and older, according to the Coastal Health District. They say vaccinations are especially important for people at a higher risk for severe illness, like older adults, young children, pregnant women, and people with weakened immune systems.When the updated COVID and flu vaccines are available in the coming weeks, the Coastal Health District will post announcements on its website.Copyright 2024 WTOC.

Image Credit: Mongkolchon Akesin / Shutterstock.com A recent study published in the Journal of Virology discusses a recent vaccine candidate that has the potential to neutralize both existing and emerging flu viruses effectively. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), seasonal influenza epidemics result in approximately 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness and about 290,000 to 650,000 respiratory deaths worldwide each year. Modern flu vaccines The three human influenza viruses, A, B, and C are represented as IAV, IBV and ICV, respectively. Each type has multiple 18 and 11 subtypes distinguished by their hemagglutin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) surface glycoproteins, respectively. H1N1 and H3N2 IAV strains and IBV circulate extensively in humans. Comparatively, H2, H5, and H7 subtypes are endemic in birds. Current flu vaccines are based on three or four seasonal subtypes of circulating human strains and range in their effectiveness from 10% to 60% The high mutation rate and selective immune pressure of influenza cause frequent antigenic variation to occur, enabling immune evasion. Thus, updated vaccine formulations are necessitated every year. Emerging viral variants could also cause a new pandemic if they escape pre-existing immunity. What are recombinant antigens? The current study sought to develop a universal recombinant vaccine candidate that could protect against multiple influenza virus strains over multiple seasons. Recombinant antigens can overcome the limitations of standard split-inactivated or attenuated vaccines. Conventional flu vaccines are produced in embryonated chicken eggs, and they contain egg-specific adaptive mutations that limit the induction of virus-specific immunity. In contrast, recombinant antigens target specific antigenic sites that elicit neutralizing antibodies. These work effectively or better than conventional vaccines in normal and high-risk groups, reducing their risk of hospitalization. About the vaccine In the current study, researchers utilized the computationally optimized broadly reactive antigen (COBRA) methodology to isolate numerous sequences from thousands of isolates. Thereafter, broadly reactive immunogens that elicit immune responses to multiple strains circulating over many seasons were identified. Diagram of ferret vaccine study. For the pre-immune vaccine groups, ferrets that had been exposed to A/California/2009 3 months previously were intranasally infected with A/Panama/1999 and B/Hong Kong/2001 60 days prior to vaccination. On days 0 and 28, pre-immune and naïve groups were vaccinated intranasally with c-di-AMP as adjuvant. Sera were collected on days 0, 28, and 56. Ferrets were challenged with A/Brisbane/02/2018 (H1N1), B/Washington/02/2019 (IBV), or A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) on day 56. Ferrets were weighed and monitored for clinical signs daily. Nasal washes were taken on days 57, 59, 61, and 63. In a previous mouse experiment, an intramuscular heptavalent vaccine containing COBRA HA and NA immunogens protected mice against both seasonal and potential pandemic IAV strains. However, intramuscular vaccines fail to induce local mucosal immunity. Comparatively, intranasal vaccines stimulate local and systemic immune responses against respiratory pathogens. This prevents viral colonization at the entry site, thereby reducing the likelihood of viral transmission and severe illness. Furthermore, intranasal vaccines are less painful, more convenient, require less skill, and are associated with fewer complications as compared to intramuscular vaccines. Octavalent COBRA immunogen In the current experiment, octavalent combinations of COBRA HA antigens H1, H2, H3, H5, and H7, IBV, and NA N1 and N2 recombinant antigens were studied. Bis-(3,5)-cyclic dimeric adenosine monophosphate (c-di-AMP) was used as an adjuvant to stimulate type 1 interferon (IFN) and tumor necrotic factor α (TNF-α) antiviral immune responses. Previously, c-di-AMP has been shown to promote both mucosal and systemic immunity and overcome immune tolerance while preventing vaccine breakdown. The vaccine candidate was administered intranasally to either naïve or pre-immune ferrets, whereas a control vaccine was administered to another group of pre-immune animals. Ferrets are the model of choice for studying influenza infections, as they exhibit similarities to humans in many key aspects of infection and immunologic response. Vaccine immunogenicity In the pre-immune group, immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to H1, N1, and N2 rose by 60 days from infection. Following vaccination, all eight antigenic components induced IgG binding antibodies. In the control group, antibody titers were unchanged, whereas H1 antibody titers decreased. Anti-stem antibodies Pre-immune but not naïve ferrets had anti-HA and anti-NA antibody titers at baseline. After vaccination, antibody titers rose in the pre-immune group, whereas naïve ferrets exhibited high binding antibody levels against all eight components of the vaccine. In the control group, titers remained unchanged, except for a reduction in anti-H1 antibodies. Baseline anti-group 1 HA stem antibody titers were high in pre-immune ferrets but not in group 2 stem antibodies. The vaccine elicited a strong rise in cross-reactive antibody titers against both group 1 and 2 stem antigens in pre-immune and naïve ferrets. HAI activity In the pre-immune group, hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titers to the post-pandemic H1N1 strains isolated in 2009, 2015, 2018, and 2019 were significantly higher than baseline levels. This immune response is significant, as HAI activity in earlier strains was very low. Pre-immune ferrets lacked detectable HAI antibodies to H3N2 strains at baseline. After vaccination, HAI titers against four of the six H3N2 strains significantly increased. The lowest titers were observed in the pre-immune control ferrets. HAI activity against the 2015 and 2018 strains decreased fourfold by day 56 post-vaccination, compared to an eightfold reduction against the 2019 strain. Anti-IBV antibodies Cross-reactive anti-IBV HAI antibodies were produced against both IBV strains following infection with one IBV lineage. In pre-immune ferrets, post-vaccination HAI titers were observed against all IBV strains, irrespective of lineage. The naïve vaccinated group exhibited a small increase in HAI titers against the infecting lineage only. Anti-pre-pandemic antibodies Baseline HAI activity was not observed against any pre-pandemic strains. After vaccination, pre-immune and naïve groups exhibited detectable HAI activity against H2, H5 and H7 antigens. Higher anti-H5 HAI titers were achieved in pre-immune ferrets with baseline antibodies to H1N1, H3N2, and IBV strains after vaccination as compared to naïve ferrets. NAI activity NA inhibition (NAI) titers to N1, but not N2, were detected at baseline in pre-immune ferrets. Following vaccination, NAI activity against both N1 and N2 increased. Protection against infection The vaccine candidate protected naïve and pre-immune ferrets against illness following infection with H1N1, IBV, and H5N1. The greatest protection was observed in the pre-immune vaccinated group. Mucosal immunity was also highest in this group; however, both pre-immune and naïve ferrets exhibited undetectable viral titers in their nasal wash fluid by day five following immunization. Conclusions The mixture of eight COBRA HA/NA proteins mixed with an intranasal adjuvant is a promising candidate for a universal influenza vaccine.” The novel vaccine formulation developed in the current study provided a balanced helper/cytotoxic/inflammatory T-cell response while also inducing the production of a broad range of IgG antibodies against virus-specific epitopes. Moreover, this octavalent vaccine elicited a cross-reactive response that was effective against new strains, which is a crucial aspect of a potential universal flu vaccine in the future. All three ferret groups exhibited cross-reactive protection against lethal H5N1 infection, which may be due to the presence of antibodies to the conserved HA stem. These may neutralize this strain by inhibiting fusion or producing Fc-receptor-mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Future studies are needed to examine the role of immune imprinting in these post-vaccination responses. The use of additional doses to counteract the immunodominance of H1 has the potential to enhance HAI responses to IBV or H3N2 strains in naïve ferrets.

The team published its findings today in the latest edition of Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.In the first outbreak, confirmed on July 8, a team of about 250 contract workers began culling the following day. Two days later, Colorado agriculture officials were notified that several workers were sick, prompting testing and empiric treatment with oseltamivir by a state health department field team. The CDPH delivered personal protective equipment (PPE) and distributed oseltamivir (Tamiflu) to all workers, regardless of symptoms.On July 14, poultry at another large layer farm tested positive for the virus, and the following day a team of about 400 contract workers began culling operations as the CDPH distributed goggles and N95 respirators. Health officials observed high compliance with PPE use and offered routine screening and empiric oseltamivir over six visits.Some with symptoms had COVIDBetween the two locations, 109 of the 663 workers reported symptoms and agreed to testing. Of those, 9 (8.3%) were positive for H5 avian flu and 19 (17.4%) were positive for COVID-19. Five of the infected workers were women. All nine had conjunctivitis and other mild symptoms. Investigators said the symptoms were similar to those reported by workers who got sick after exposure to H5N1-infected dairy cows. Though they couldn’t rule out environmental contamination—such as noninfectious viral particles carried in the nose or eye—they said the evidence leans toward actual infections. Which is especially likely because four of the nine people who tested positive were swabbed in the morning, before exposure to environmental or occupational contamination that day. Also, virus was isolated from the clinical specimens of five patients.Multilingual response teams were keyExposure risks included having to catch and handle each live bird and inconsistent or improper PPE use in a setting where hundreds of workers were urgently hired for poultry depopulation. Extreme heat also added to PPE compliance challenges. The clusters in poultry workers emphasize the ongoing threat of H5N1 to people who have close contact with infected animals, the team wrote, adding that early response with multilingual teams were crucial for building trust, conducting screening, and providing treatment.Public health agencies should proactively prepare for additional human cases in both dairy and poultry facilities."Given the continued circulation of this virus in the United States, public health agencies should proactively prepare for additional human cases in both dairy and poultry facilities," the authors concluded. "This preparation should include distributing PPE; training public health field teams on proper PPE use; determining the logistics of large-scale screening, specimen collection, and laboratory testing to distinguish influenza A(H5) virus from seasonal respiratory viruses; acquiring oseltamivir; and developing standardized protocols for empiric treatment or [post-exposure prevention] with oseltamivir."

They noted that cattle movement between states, which played a role in initial spread, picks back up in the fall due to greater demand for milk, partly due to schools resuming.Suspected outbreaks in Central ValleyThe California Department of Food and Agriculture yesterday announced that it is investigating the possible introduction of the virus into three dairy farms in the state’s Central Valley. It said samples have been sent for testing to California Animal Health and Food Safety laboratory. If positive, they will be considered "presumptive" and submitted to the USDA for confirmation.In early June, WastewaterSCAN launched an H5 wastewater dashboard to help track undetected H5 spread, and, since then, traces of the virus have been found in nine states, seven of which have reported H5N1 outbreaks in dairy cows. California and Arkansas were the only two states with positive H5 wastewater findings that hadn't reported recent outbreaks on dairy or poultry farms.California is the nation's top milk production state and accounts for one fifth of the nation's supply. The state has about 1,100 dairy farms, and herds in Tulare, Merced, and Stanislaus counties make up just more than half of the state's milk output. FDA approves use of Novavax's updated COVID vaccine News brief Lisa Schnirring Topics COVID-19 rogerashford / iStock The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) today announced that it has granted emergency use authorization for Novavax's updated COVID-19 vaccine. Approval of the protein-based vaccine comes about a week after the FDA green-lighted the two updated mRNA vaccines—made by Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech—which target the KP.2 variant. The Novavax vaccine targets JN.1, the parent of KP.2.Novavax's updated vaccine is authorized for people ages 12 and older. A third COVID vaccine optionIn a statement, Peter Marks, MD, PhD, who directs the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said COVID vaccines continue to have a major positive impact on public health and that vaccination continues to be the most effective method for COVID prevention. "Today's authorization provides an additional COVID-19 vaccine option that meets the FDA's standards for safety, effectiveness and manufacturing quality needed to support emergency use authorization."Today's authorization provides an additional COVID-19 vaccine option that meets the FDA's standards.The company has said the vaccine will be available in prefilled syringes and that it will promptly deliver it as soon as the FDA authorizes the vaccine. Its data suggest the JN.1 monovalent vaccine induces broad neutralization responses against JN.1 lineage viruses, including ones such as KP.2 and KP.3 COVID still on the rise in parts of US News brief Lisa Schnirring Topics COVID-19 As the United States heads into the Labor Day holiday weekend and with schools resuming, COVID-19 activity continues to rise in many areas, but it's showing early signs of decline in others, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said today in its data updates. dronepicr / Flickr cc Wastewater SARS-CoV-2 detections are still at the very high level and are highest in the South. Though levels are dropping in the West, they are rising in the South, Midwest, and Northeast, the CDC said.Meanwhile, wastewater tracking from WastewaterSCAN shows that detections nationally are still at the high level, with no clear trend up or down over the past 3 weeks. The group, however, noted an upward trend in the Midwest. WastewaterSCAN is a national wastewater monitoring system based at Stanford University in partnership with Emory University.KP.3.1.1 levels climb; hospitalizations elevatedIn updated variant proportion estimates today, the CDC said the level of KP.3.1.1—a JN.1 offshoot thought to more easily evade immunity from earlier infection and vaccination—continues to rise sharply and is at 42.2%, up from 29.5% 2 weeks ago.Among the CDC’s other COVID indicators, national test positivity is at 17%, down a hair since the previous week. Positivity is higher in Texas and surrounding states and in the lower Midwestern states than in other parts of the country. Emergency department visits declined from the previous week and are highest in parts of the South and Southeast.Hospitalizations from COVID remain elevated, especially in seniors and in children younger than 2 years old, the CDC said in its weekly respiratory illness summary.Deaths from COVID-19, though still low, rose last week and were at the highest level in Kentucky. Chinese researchers warn of rise in Acinetobacter strains carrying multiple carbapenemase genes News brief Chris Dall, MA Topics Antimicrobial Stewardship Dan Higgins, James Archer / CDC A study by Chinese researchers indicates a global rise in Acinetobacter species carrying multiple carbapenem-resistance genes.In a letter published yesterday in Clinical Microbiology and Infection, a team led by researchers from Zhejiang University School of Medicine said analysis of 30,713 Acinetobacter genomes from the National Center for Biotechnology Information Pathogen Detection Database revealed that 1,409 (5.1%) of 27,487 A baumannii isolates and 216 (6.7%) of 3,226 non-baumannii Acinetobacter spp. (nAB) isolates co-harbored at least two carbapenemases, with notable increases from 2018 through 2023. Multiple carbapenemase-positive Acinetobacter genomes were detected in 61 countries across six continents, with the highest prevalence found in the United States (33.7%), India (13.3%), and China (8.6%).Carbapenem-resistant A baumannii is already considered an urgent public health threat by the World Health Organization and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention because it's so difficult to treat. Some studies have found mortality rates as high as 72% in patients with carbapenem-resistant A baumannii infections.But among the 54 distinct combinations of double carbapenemases identified, the analysis also found the co-existence of metallo-beta-lactamase and tetracycline-inactivating genes, which confer resistance to many of the recently approved beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations (such as ceftazidime/avibactam and meropenem/vaborbactam) and tigecycline, all of which have been considered potential treatments for carbapenem-resistant A baumannii infections. These combinations, the study authors said, further restrict the antibiotic treatment options for Acinetobacter infections.Strains found in clinical settings, livestock, and the environmentWhile nearly all the A baumannii strains originated from clinical settings, 33.5% of the nAB strains were isolated from environmental or livestock sources, the researchers added."In summary, the prevalence of Acinetobacter species co-harboring multiple carbapenemases is increasing globally, and the emergence of novel combinations of carbapenemases and their coexistence with Tet(X) enzymes requires further investigation" they wrote. "Moreover, the global emergence of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter species in diverse sources emphasizes the critical importance for a One Health approach for the investigation and control of its spread." Investors can play 'pivotal role' in addressing antimicrobial resistance, report says News brief Chris Dall, MA Topics Antimicrobial Stewardship robtek / iStock A new report lays out the financial risks posed by antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and how investors might be able to mitigate them.The health risks posed by drug-resistant pathogens are already well known. A 2022 study published in The Lancet estimated that AMR was directly responsible for 1.27 million deaths, and contributed to an additional 3.7 million deaths, in 2019. That's more than the number of deaths caused by HIV/AIDS, malaria, and many cancers.But the report published this week by the Farm Animal Investment Risk & Return (FAIRR) initiative, the MSCI Sustainability Institute, and Investor Action on AMR highlights the significant financial costs. According to World Bank estimates, unchecked drug-resistance could cause annual gross domestic product losses ranging from US $1 trillion to $3.4 trillion by 2030, driven by increased human and veterinary healthcare costs, reduced productivity, and declines in global livestock production. Those losses could rise to $100 trillion by 2050 if the weak pipeline for new antibiotics continues to falter.Incorporating an 'AMR lens' into investment decisionsBut investors can play a role in addressing AMR by incorporating an "AMR lens" into investment decisions, the report suggests. This means identifying opportunities to invest in companies that are part of the solution to AMR and avoiding investments that exacerbate it. One clear area of opportunity is antibiotic research and development"Investors can play a pivotal role in driving the research and development of new antibiotics, diagnostics, and alternative treatments," the report states. "By providing the necessary funding, investors can help accelerate the pace of innovation and commercialization of solutions."Investors can play a pivotal role in driving the research and development of new antibiotics, diagnostics, and alternative treatments.In addition, the report suggests that investors can work with companies in the livestock sector to encourage them to reduce inappropriate antibiotic use and adopt alternative treatment strategies, invest in global AMR surveillance systems that will help companies with global risk planning, and support healthcare companies that are using tools and databases to evaluate appropriate antibiotic use."By working collaboratively, investors can address existing gaps and promote sustainable practices," the report states. "Understanding the economic impact, integrating AMR into investment decisions, and supporting research and innovation are crucial." Study: Highlighting harms of skipping COVID vaccines more effective than promoting benefits News brief Stephanie Soucheray, MA Topics COVID-19 twinsterphoto / iStock A new study in the Journal of Public Health suggests that it is more effective to emphasize the harms that come from not getting vaccinated rather than emphasizing the benefits of vaccination at the individual or community level.The study was based on findings from three experimental messages given to 1,085 participants from China who were randomly assigned to one of four groups, including one control group. All groups were given a message about COVID-19 vaccination; the first group was told, "Vaccination can make you develop antibodies against COVID-19, thus reducing the likelihood of contracting COVID- 19 and developing severe symptoms after infection."The second group’s message was "Vaccination can promote the formation of community herd immunity, thereby reducing the likelihood of community members getting infected with COVID-19 and developing severe symptoms after infection," while the third group’s message emphasized harm: "If you are not vaccinated, you will not develop antibodies to COVID-19, and thus you will be more susceptible to COVID-19 and more likely to develop severe symptoms after infection."73% of harm group willing to get vaccinated When asked about intent to receive the COVID-19 vaccine after hearing the group’s message, 72.6%. of the harm group said they would get vaccinated, compared to 62% in the community-benefit group. In the personal-benefit group, 65.5% said they likely to get vaccinated."The findings of the study can provide valuable insights for improving the ability of governments to respond to pandemics,” said senior author Ke Feng, PhD, of the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, in a press release from Oxford University Press.

We also illustrate how scenario modeling helped inform the Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics’ 2024-2025 Respiratory Season Outlook, a high-level assessment on how the season could unfold. Scenario Modeling Overview Disease modeling provides insights into how pathogens might spread through a population, informing preparedness and response efforts. Two types of disease modeling—forecasting and scenario modeling—attempt to capture past dynamics to illustrate how future disease dynamics might occur. While similar in approaches, scenario modeling allows us to explore longer-term hypotheticals in the form of "what if" questions, whereas forecasting focuses on shorter-term predictions and quantifying uncertainty. Because forecasting focuses on the near-term future, this approach is more useful in predicting what will happen, while scenario modeling is helpful for exploring a broader set of long-term outcomes under a range of assumptions about the future, providing insights for addressing specific policy questions and for general preparedness and planning. Scenario Modeling to Inform Specific Policy Questions Scenario modeling allows decision-makers to examine a range of possible outcomes under different assumptions about the future. Scenario models can examine the impact of factors that are out of our control, such as the emergence of a new variant or severity of disease, informing preparedness and situational awareness. Scenario models can also examine factors that are under our control, such as vaccination or treatment recommendations, guiding decisions about interventions and policies (Howerton et al., 2023). COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub results have been used to anticipate the possible number of COVID-19 hospitalizations under a variety of potential conditions, including new viral variants and vaccine uptake, and have informed discussions around specific vaccination policies (Borchering et al., 2023). The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) used the results to help guide their interim recommendations for the use of bivalent booster doses of COVID-19 vaccines in 2022. Scenarios demonstrated that increased vaccination coverage among a broader subset of the population would result in a reduction in hospitalizations and deaths from COVID-19 (Rosenblum et al., 2022) regardless of a new variant emerging. Modeling results were also used to evaluate the impact of different COVID-19 vaccine recommendations in 2023-2024 and 2024-2025. Scenario Modeling for Planning and Preparedness Scenario models can also inform planning and preparedness, such as evaluating how diseases might progress over several months or during a respiratory season. Below we detail how scenario models were used to help inform long-term planning for the respiratory virus season in the 2024-2025 Respiratory Disease Season Outlook. Scenario Modeling in the 2024-2025 Respiratory Season Outlook Every winter, the U.S. hospital system prepares for an increase of emergency department visits and hospitalizations from the three major seasonal respiratory diseases: COVID-19, influenza, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). COVID-19 has added substantial disease burden to the respiratory season, increasing the risk of hospital strain compared to pre-pandemic years. To provide public health decision-makers with potential scenarios for how the season could unfold for each disease, we used two separate modeling approaches in our 2024-2025 Respiratory Disease Season Outlook. The first was a dynamic disease transmission model to examine potential hospitalization burden for COVID-19. The second was a model to estimate the number of hospitalizations that could be prevented in the upcoming season due to vaccination for influenza and RSV. Transmission Modeling Approach Model Structure Our COVID-19 transmission model used a compartmental modeling structure, which groups the population into categories or "compartments" based on characteristics such as their age, infection history, and disease status. The model then uses mathematical equations to describe how groups move between compartments (e.g., from uninfected to infected, or from unvaccinated to vaccinated). A common example of this type of model for infectious diseases is the SEIR model, where compartments represent S: susceptible, E: exposed, I: infectious, and R: recovered (Figure 1). Figure 1: Disease state progression in our compartmental model, where S is Susceptible, E is Exposed, I is Infectious, and R is Recovered. Compartmental models can include more complexity—and therefore more accurately depict the real world depending on data availability—by incorporating factors such as age structure of the population, infection and vaccine history, and waning immunity. These models also incorporate both the effects of vaccination on protecting vaccinated individuals (direct effects) and reducing transmission (indirect effects). However, more complexity can increase the time needed to develop and deploy the model, increase the amount and types of data required to calibrate the model, and make the results more challenging to interpret. Compartmental models can provide insights into questions such as, “When might weekly hospitalizations peak this winter?” To answer this question, a model requires disease-specific values, or parameters, that represent various characteristics of infection, such as transmission rates, incubation period, and duration of infectiousness. Model structures and parameters can be adjusted to create hypothetical scenarios representing public health interventions (e.g., vaccinations that increase immunity or treatments that shorten infectiousness period) or pathogen evolution (e.g., a new variant with a shorter incubation period). The modeled output from each scenario can be compared to understand how each factor affects the estimated number of weekly hospital admissions, which in turn can help with planning, preparedness, and public health decision-making. How did we use this modeling approach in the outlook? To evaluate different COVID-19 hospitalization burden scenarios for the 2024-2025 respiratory season in the U.S., we developed a compartmental model that takes into account population age structure, previous infection, vaccination, immunity waning, and multiple variants. To improve accuracy of the model and ensure it aligned with real-world observations, we calibrated it to hospitalization, serology, and strain prevalence data for each U.S. state using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations. Among other parameters, our MCMC approach estimates age- and state-specific hospitalization-per-infection rates, which we used to translate modeled infections into hospitalizations. We produced forward projections (sample size = 100) for each state and scenario, and then aggregated the state-level output to produce national projections. At the time of publication (August 2024), there was an ongoing COVID-19 wave, which resulted in uncertainty in how the wave would impact the magnitude and timing of peak hospitalization burden for the fall/winter 2024-2025 respiratory season. While this model can be used to evaluate the impact of interventions such as vaccinations, given this uncertainty, we chose instead to focus on two scenarios of how the respiratory season might unfold. These two scenarios were modeled based on inferred hospitalization rates using National Syndromic Surveillance Program (NSSP) emergency department visits (Scenario A) and the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET) hospitalization data (Scenario B). We also assumed vaccine effectiveness and uptake similar to the 2023-2024 respiratory season and modeled a potential new winter variant with similar properties (innate transmission ability, immune escape relative to earlier variants, and introduction timing) as JN.1, the variant that drove the 2023-2024 winter wave. Prior to April 27, 2024, we used the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) hospitalization data to characterize the national COVID-19 burden. NHSN data reporting requirements changed after April 27, 2024, necessitating that we infer hospitalization rates through other indirect data sources: NSSP nationwide emergency department visits and COVID-19 hospitalization surveillance network data (COVID-NET) from a subset of hospitals nationwide. We predicted national hospitalization rates for each of these data sources using linear regression, fitting the linear models using data from July 2022 to April 2024. We then used the fitted model to estimate hospitalizations nationwide from May 2024 to July 2024 (Figure 2). Figure 2. COVID-19 scenario modeling results for two potential scenarios for the 2024-2025 respiratory season. Dashed lines represent two inferred COVID-19 hospitalization rate scenarios for the summer, using hospitalization data for relatively small subset of hospitals (Scenario A) or emergency department visit data (Scenario B). Ribbons represent 50% prediction interval range of modeling results. The model is calibrated to NHSN data (historical COVID-19 hospitalizations line in figure).Show More For Scenario A, we found that if summer COVID-19 activity continues to increase into the fall and doesn’t peak before the respiratory season (October-April), the wave may peak in the range of 7.2-9.7 peak weekly hospitalizations per 100,000 during late December 2024. For Scenario B, we found that if the summer COVID-19 activity peaks before respiratory season begins, modeling results suggest that a second, smaller wave would occur mid-January 2025, with a range of 4.2-5.8 peak weekly hospitalizations per 100,000. We highlight these two example scenarios to demonstrate the range of uncertainty for how this season could unfold at a national level. In both scenarios, the peak COVID-19 hospitalization burden is lower than last year's peak. Influenza and RSV Prevented-Burden Modeling Model Structure For influenza and RSV, we used a modeling approach that allows for estimating the effect that immunization could have on preventing hospital admissions in this coming respiratory season. This modeling approach is similar to ones used by the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD) Influenza Division and the COVID-19 Response to retrospectively estimate hospital admissions prevented by vaccination (Reed et al. EID 2009; Steele et al., 2022,Tokars et al., 2018,Rolfes et al., 2019). The model assumes that immunization protects those who are vaccinated against severe outcomes (direct effects) but does not prevent disease transmission (indirect effects). This simplification means that the model underestimates the value of immunization, but it also means that a relatively simple calculation can be used to estimate the number of hospital admissions prevented by vaccination. This approach uses fewer parameters and requires fewer data inputs than the dynamic transmission models described above. In a hypothetical example of a single immunization event in a fixed population, this calculation reduces to: Burden with immunization = Burden without immunization * (1 - coverage * effectiveness) To develop a baseline projection of next season’s burden, we first used RSV and influenza hospitalization data from last season, adjusting for the fact that not everyone hospitalized because of influenza or RSV has received a positive test. Next, we use the above equation to infer the number of hospitalizations that would occur next season if no one is immunized. Finally, we reverse the calculation to estimate the number of hospitalizations that would occur under certain assumptions about future immunization coverage and effectiveness. The prevented burden is estimated as the difference between the counterfactual, no-immunization burden and the observed burden. How did we use this modeling approach in the outlook? We used this method to generate a hypothetical hospital admission time course for several influenza and RSV scenarios. Immunizations assessed include the seasonal influenza vaccine, the RSV vaccines for older adults (Arexvy, Abrysvo, mRESVIA), the RSV immunization for infants and young children (nirsevimab), and the RSV vaccine for pregnant persons to protect their infants (Abrysvo). We developed scenarios for 2024-2025 using aggregate estimates from the expert elicitation process for effectiveness and uptake of all immunizations.A Select modeling results from this approach were included in the Respiratory Disease Season Outlook to help assess how the season might play out. Modeling results showed that prevented hospitalizations for flu and RSV varied across scenarios. Of note, our work is prospective and illustrates a limited set of possible futures to inform planning and preparedness activities. These scenarios provide insight into how the season may unfold, and the actual 2024-2025 season may differ substantially from these scenarios. Conclusions In conclusion, scenario modeling allows us to examine how disease transmission dynamics may fluctuate depending on different circumstances and explore how long-term hypothetical scenarios may occur over the course of a season. Scenario modeling has informed vaccination policy and enabled planning and preparedness. Both the compartmental modeling as well as the vaccine-prevented burden modeling approaches have their advantages and disadvantages, with both approaches offering insight for decision-making and planning for the 2024-2025 Respiratory Disease Season Outlook.

In partnership with Metaculus, CDC designed a questionnaire and process for soliciting views from experts on the upcoming fall and winter respiratory season. Experts each answered a series of questions on the expected hospitalization burden posed by each disease, as well as on key drivers for a season with a higher peak hospitalization rate. After experts submitted initial responses to the questionnaire, CDC and Metaculus convened a workshop to discuss results and any key areas of disagreement. Experts were then allowed to update their responses, if desired. The final results were used to inform this Respiratory Disease Season Outlook and as inputs into scenario modeling.

Photo: CanvaThe French department of agriculture has purchased another 67.75 million doses of a vaccine against high pathogenic avian influenza. The new avian influenza vaccination campaign will begin on 1 October. The government will cover 70% of the costs during the first 3 months of the campaign, the department in Paris has announced. France began a first vaccination round of poultry against highly pathogenic avian influenza last autumn after the country had been hit by serious, large-scale outbreaks of the disease in some previous winters, particularly among ducks, which appeared to be very susceptible to avian influenza infection. Those outbreaks occurred mainly in the south-western part of the country, which is the centre of intensive duck farming for the foie gras industry. The largest avian influenza vaccination campaign Over the last few months, some 50 million ducks have been vaccinated – this, says the department, is the first campaign seen globally on such a large scale. As a result, France didn’t report any major highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreaks last winter or spring, apart from the occasional case. However, earlier in August, a new case emerged at a chicken farm in the Brittany region in the very west of the country. ALSO READ: Spotting avian influenza with infrared imagingThe department says a new vaccination campaign is needed because the epidemiological context indicates a high infection rate with HPAI among wild birds. “The first campaign has been a success thanks to the close cooperation between all parties involved – the vaccine suppliers, veterinarians, agricultural organisations, the government and the poultry holders themselves,” said the department. “We can now build on that success and the experience and knowledge we gathered with the first action. The government initiates a new campaign in order to avoid the avian influenza virus to enter and spread in our country.” French and German vaccine produces The 67.75 million new doses will be supplied by 2 producers, German Boehringer Ingelheim Animal Health and French pharmaceutical company Ceva Santé Animale. In the first round, the department only selected Boehringer Ingelheim as a supplier but that lead to critical comments from both the livestock community and Ceve Santé Animale itself.

Partners University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus provides funding as a member of The Conversation US. View all partners Email X (Twitter) Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger The current strain of avian flu, H5N1, is responsible for the culling of millions of domestic birds and has sickened more than a dozen farmworkers in 2024, most recently in Colorado. The Conversation U.S. asked immunologist and microbiologist Jenna Guthmiller from the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus to explain the historical roots of H5N1, its mode of transmission and how to avoid coming into contact with it. What is H5N1? H5N1 is a subtype of influenza A viruses. Other commonly known influenza A virus subtypes include H1N1 and H3N2, which cause seasonal outbreaks in humans. Unlike H1N1 and H3N2, H5N1 largely infects wild birds, with waterfowl such as ducks and geese being the natural reservoirs for H5N1 viruses. Most H5N1 viruses are highly pathogenic avian influenza, meaning spillovers into other bird populations can lead to high mortality rates, including domesticated poultry. H5N1 viruses were first identified in 1959 due to an outbreak in domesticated chickens in Scotland. In 1996, waterfowl were identified as the natural reservoir for H5N1. Since its identification, H5N1 viruses have led to four major outbreaks: in 1997, 2003-2005, 2015 and 2021-to-present. The outbreaks in 1997 and 2003-2005 led to substantial spillover to humans. Since 2003, nearly 900 H5N1 infections in humans have been recorded. Of those infections, more than half were fatal. Where did H5N1 originate? The current outbreak of H5N1 started in late 2021 and derives from the virus that caused a major outbreak in 2015. Since 2021, H5N1 strains have spread to six continents by migratory birds. Spillover to domestic poultry has led to the culling of millions of domestic birds Researchers have documented the current H5N1 strain in numerous mammals, with it largely affecting aquatic mammals like seals and scavenger mammals. Sporadic spillover to domestic mammals has been recorded, including to minks, goats and alpacas. In March 2024, the U.S. Department of Agriculture reported an outbreak of H5N1 in lactating dairy cows. As of Aug. 27, 192 herds in 13 states have been confirmed H5N1 positive. Dairy cow-associated H5N1 viruses have since jumped back into wild birds, and recent outbreaks in domestic poultry resembled H5N1 in dairy cows. Between May and July 2024, 13 confirmed H5N1 infections have occurred in humans, with all cases directly linked to dairy farms and poultry culling. The concern is that the virus could evolve to allow human-to-human transmission. Why did the avian flu become more widespread? It is unclear why H5N1 has become such a widespread problem. H5N1, like all influenza viruses, rapidly mutates to infect new hosts. However, H5N1 has several features that could increase its host range. First, H5N1 viruses use a protein called hemagglutinin that allows H5N1 to infect with new hosts. Second, my research group identified a mutation in H5N1 viruses causing the dairy cow outbreak that allows hemagglutinin to bind to its receptor more efficiently. Lastly, H5N1 viruses are mutating genes associated with replication and immune evasion that are known to increase the infection of mammals. Together, these factors could heighten H5N1 transmission and increase H5N1 spillover to mammals. How is the strain transmitted to dairy cattle? H5N1 viruses are largely causing infections in the mammary glands of cattle rather than the respiratory tract, which is the main site of infection for other influenza viruses in mammals. Recent studies have shown that the mammary tissue has receptors for H5N1, which could make this tissue susceptible to infection. Since the infection is largely restricted to the mammary glands, researchers believe that H5N1 is being transmitted to cows by contaminated milk equipment, particularly the milking apparatus that attaches to the cow udders. Transmission across farms is due to infected cattle movement and shared equipment and personnel across dairy farms. To reduce transmission, in April 2024, the USDA put in testing requirements for when cows are transported across state lines. In addition, Colorado, the state with the greatest number of positive herds, requires weekly testing on farms to identify infected herds. What are the risks to people and other animals? H5N1 does not pose a risk to the general public, as this virus is not known to transmit between people. As all known cases were those with direct contact with infected animals, people with occupational exposure to H5N1-infected cows and poultry continue to be at the greatest risk of infection. People with occupational hazards should be aware of the H5N1 symptoms – similar to those of a cold – such as congestion, sore throat and fatigue, as well as conjunctivitis, more commonly known as pink eye. For more information, see the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s webpage on avian influenza in people. Domestic and wild animals near dairy farms are at high risk of infection. Particularly, barn cats that have been fed raw milk have been reported dead on dairy farms with infected cows, with these animals coming back positive for H5N1. In addition, spillover of H5N1 to other domesticated farm animals near infected dairy cows has been recorded. What are the best ways to keep farm workers safe? Using personal protective equipment, such as goggles and gloves, remains the best way to prevent the transmission of H5N1 to humans and from humans back to animals. People working around poultry or dairy cattle should also be aware of biosecurity measures, such as not wearing the same clothes and boots when traveling from one farm to another. Is drinking dairy milk a concern? As long as you are consuming pasteurized milk products, there are no concerns for infections in humans. Pasteurization is very effective at killing any H5N1 virus that ends up in milk. People should avoid raw or unpasteurized milk, as H5N1 virus has been found at very high levels in raw milk.

Pertussis The Virginia Department of Health (VDH) is reporting an increase in pertussis (whooping cough) cases. As of August 1, 2024, more than five times as many cases have been reported compared to the same time last year and exceed pre-pandemic levels. This trend is linked to a rise in pertussis outbreaks across the Commonwealth occurring in group settings, including universities, schools, religious communities, and childcare settings. Outbreaks of pertussis can be large and last for several weeks or longer, impacting both vaccinated and unvaccinated persons. VDH recommends that healthcare providers: Maintain a heightened index of suspicion for pertussis in patients presenting with cough illness. Obtain a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab or aspirate for testing of suspected cases. Contact your local health department to request pertussis testing at Virginia’s state public health laboratory. Ensure timely receipt of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) antibiotics for contacts meeting high-risk criteria. People who refuse PEP should be excluded from high-risk settings for 21 days. Ensure all patients are up to date on DTaP and Tdap vaccination. Avian Influenza A(H5N1) VDH continues to monitor the outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) in poultry and dairy cattle that has resulted in human infections in parts of the United States. At this time, there are no reports of cases in cattle or people in Virginia and the risk of H5N1 infection for the general public remains low. For more information on H5N1, please see VDH’s Avian Influenza webpage. VDH recommends that healthcare providers: Ensure people who have job-related exposure to infected or potentially infected cattle, birds, or other animals get vaccinated for seasonal influenza. While the seasonal influenza vaccine will not protect against H5N1, it can help prevent a person becoming ill with seasonal flu or becoming coinfected with a seasonal flu virus and H5N1. Maintain a low threshold for testing people for H5N1 if they have compatible signs and symptoms and a relevant exposure history. Streptococcal Disease, Group A, Invasive There has been a noted increase in reported invasive Group A Streptococcus (iGAS) cases and outbreaks in Virginia for the past few years. This increase follows national trends of increasing invasive and noninvasive group A strep cases. In Virginia, an increase in iGAS cases have continued for the first half of 2024, surpassing the number of cases reported in 2023 during the same timeframe. Healthcare providers should: Consider antibiotic resistance testing for iGAS infections. CDC reports about 1 in 3 iGAS infections are now caused by bacteria that are resistant to erythromycin and clindamycin. Consider iGAS in groups that are at increased risk for getting a serious group A strep infection such as: people with preceding viral infections like flu or chickenpox, people aged 65 years or older, residents of long-term care facilities, people who inject drugs or who are experiencing homelessness, and people with immunocompromising conditions. Stay up to date on infection prevention strategies in long term care facilities for GAS and wound care. Mpox CDC recently issued a Health Alert Network health update about the large, ongoing clade I mpox outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). It continues to grow and has spread to neighboring countries​. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared mpox to be a public health emergency of international concern on August 14. The risk for Clade I mpox in the general U.S. population is very low. Clade I cases in the U.S. have not been reported.​ VDH asks providers to maintain a high index of suspicion of mpox in recent travelers to affected areas and their close contacts. Providers should report suspected cases to the local health department and discuss clade testing at the Division of Consolidated Laboratory Services. Mpox cases associated with the ongoing 2022 global outbreak and milder virus strain (Clade II) continue to occur in Virginia. People at risk for mpox can maximize their protection by getting both doses of the JYNNEOS vaccine. Thank you for your continued partnership and attention to these timely updates.

But the point is, we don’t wait for that to happen. Right?”US to survey dairy cattle brought to slaughter to study bird flu infectionsRead moreGlobal officials have feared an H5N1 pandemic ever since the first case was detected among people in 1997.Highly pathogenic influenza viruses have been closely watched for decades because of their pandemic potential, and it was partly because of its monitoring for pandemic-potential pathogens like these that the US ranked No 1 for pandemic preparedness in 2019.Yet when struck by a new respiratory virus, SARS-CoV-2, the US fared much worse than other countries in the global north, with at least 1.2 million deaths and millions more sickened and disabled by the virus.Experts are still unraveling the reasons why – and trying to draw attention to these failures before the next avoidable crisis.A lack of testing and monitoring of the virus plagued the Covid response, from the limited and faulty tests in the early days to the lack of testing that persisted. Similarly, scientists now know H5N1 circulated in cattle for months before being detected, and reporting indicates infections among farm workers may have gone unreported as well. Some employers at farms have been reluctant to cooperate with health officials – much like the meatpacking industry was with Covid, Gonsalves said.The confusing and byzantine structure of federal, state and local agency responsibility also creates significant challenges. Although there were calls for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to be granted greater powers to lead federal responses to pandemics because of Covid, no such changes have been made.Agencies still struggle with jurisdiction and collaboration, and there are also substantial differences between federal, state and local approaches. With Covid, “we had a patchwork of state responses, some of which were more robust than others, and we paid for it”, Gonsalves said.The curbs on public health powers only worsened because of Covid. At least 26 states introduced new laws putting limits on public health authorities during the pandemic.Iowa and Tennessee, for example, now prohibit mask requirements in schools, and health officials can’t close schools in Wisconsin.That’s deeply troubling because the next pandemic could greatly affect school-aged children, which has been true of influenza historically, Gonsalves said. “We’re fixated on what just happened, not having any sort of imagination of what a new pandemic could bring.”The next pandemic virus could spread even faster and be even more lethal – and that’s true even if the virus itself isn’t more virulent, because of the lack of funding for, trust in, and authority of public health, he said.Recent decisions from the US supreme court, including invoking the “major questions” doctrine and overturning the Chevron precedent, mean federal agencies would likely need explicit permission from Congress, which can be divided and slow to act, to take quick action and stem new outbreaks.“We’re basically being told, ‘Ignore what just happened over the past four-plus years, ignore what’s happening now with bird flu, and let’s tie your hands behind your backs in terms of being able to respond when the time comes,’” Gonsalves said.Political fractures only worsened during the Covid pandemic and threaten to derail efforts to contain outbreaks of infectious diseases.Growing anti-vaccine sentiment could block the development and distribution of new and existing pharmaceuticals, like vaccines, once they have gone through the complicated and expensive process of development. Operation Warp Speed, a massive and successful project to produce Covid vaccines quickly, wound down instead of becoming a regular fixture in pandemic response.Inequities have hampered vaccine distribution even now. “We have a fractured healthcare system, which means if you can’t get a vaccine because you don’t have insurance right now, you’re shit out of luck,” Gonsalves said.Those who can afford it may access quality health care in the US, but serious gaps remain for those who are uninsured or under-insured. The US health system has “the most fancy tertiary care in the world”, he said, but it stumbles on primary care, preventive medicine and public health. “We’re not good at the basics.”Vast inequality meant some patients were able to access some of the most sophisticated care in the world while others struggled to find enough masks, ventilators and treatments. While other countries softened the worst of the pandemic’s blows with social safety nets, many Americans were left to fend for themselves, Gonsalves said. And the focus on individual health overlooks the role of public health, which is collective by definition.Despite these fatal missteps, the US has never had a Covid commission to analyze what went wrong, as countries like the UK have done. There was a bipartisan effort to create an inquiry similar to the 9/11 Commission, but it fizzled.It was America’s sense of misplaced and persistent confidence that it was handling the pandemic as well as possible that perhaps most damaged its response, Gonsalves said. “We have a vastly overinflated view of our abilities, capacities and willingness to do the right thing.”Officials have reiterated, for instance, that “we have the tools” – yet treatments and vaccines quickly become outdated as the virus evolves, while access issues and misinformation persist and other precautions, like isolating for the duration of illness, are no longer recommended.There’s still time to correct these mistakes, the experts said.“Everybody is exceedingly grateful that we are not stuck in a loop of 2020, in which our hospitals were overflowing, morgues were overflowing and we had no recourse against the virus,” Gonsalves said. But “we can do a lot more”, from updating respiratory virus guidance with the latest evidence on transmission to improving indoor air quality.The Covid pandemic has been “one of the most important historical events in the United States in the past 100 years, in terms of public health. We’ve all suffered,” Gonsalves said. “The best way to avoid the pain that we’ve felt in the past four years is being prepared.”Explore more on these topicsUS newsBird fluCoronavirusHealthInfectious diseasesnewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveTax strategyFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInXNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

PDF FILE Over 100 million birds lost in the U.S. since outbreak began The United States is grappling with one of the most severe avian influenza outbreaks in its history. Since the onset of the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus on February 8, 2022, the country has witnessed the loss of over 100.7 million birds. This staggering figure includes both birds that succumbed to the disease and those culled as a preventive measure. Impact on poultry industry The outbreak has had a devastating impact on the poultry industry, particularly in states like Iowa, which has reported the highest number of affected birds. Over 23.3 million birds in Iowa alone have been impacted, primarily in commercial poultry farms. The virus has spread across 48 states, affecting a total of 1,173 flocks, including 508 commercial and 665 backyard flocks. Economic consequences The economic ramifications of this outbreak are profound. The poultry industry, a significant contributor to the U.S. economy, has faced substantial losses. The culling of millions of birds has led to a decrease in poultry supply, driving up prices for consumers. Additionally, the cost of implementing biosecurity measures and compensating farmers for their losses has placed a financial strain on both the industry and the government. Efforts to contain the virusContinue after advertising. Efforts to contain the virus have been extensive. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has been at the forefront of these efforts, working closely with state and local authorities to monitor and control the spread of the disease. Measures include increased surveillance, culling of infected and exposed birds, and strict biosecurity protocols to prevent further outbreaks. Human health concerns While the primary impact of the H5N1 virus has been on birds, there are concerns about its potential to affect human health. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported a few cases of human infection, primarily among individuals who had direct contact with infected birds. However, the risk to the general public remains low, and there is no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission. Future outlook The future outlook for the avian influenza crisis in the U.S. remains uncertain. While the number of new cases has decreased in recent months, the virus continues to pose a threat. Ongoing surveillance and biosecurity measures are crucial to prevent future outbreaks. Additionally, research into vaccines and treatments for avian influenza is ongoing, offering hope for more effective control and prevention strategies in the future. In conclusion, the avian influenza outbreak in the U.S. has resulted in the loss of over 100 million birds, with significant economic and health implications. Continued efforts to monitor, control, and prevent the spread of the virus are essential to mitigate its impact and protect both the poultry industry and public health.

The epicentre of the outbreak was in the Puri district, about 19 miles from the state capital Bhubaneswar, and follows the recent death of 1,800 birds at a local poultry farm. “The work is ongoing. We are going to cull about 20,000 birds,” Additional Director of Disease Control Jagannath Nanda told Reuters. The H5N1 strain is considered highly pathogenic and can also be transmitted to animals such as pigs, horses, large cats, dogs, and occasionally humans. The spread of the virus is a concern for governments and the poultry industry due to the devastation it can cause to flocks, the possibility of trade restrictions and the risk of human transmission.

PDF FILE In a significant move to protect its poultry industry, France is set to launch its second commercial vaccination campaign against Avian Influenza H5N1. This initiative, scheduled to begin on October 1, 2024, follows the success of the inaugural campaign last year, which saw the vaccination of over 50 million ducks. Background and importance Avian Influenza H5N1, a highly pathogenic virus, poses a severe threat to poultry worldwide. The virus can cause high mortality rates in birds, leading to substantial economic losses for farmers and the broader agricultural sector. In recent years, outbreaks have been reported globally, prompting countries to adopt various measures to control its spread. France, a major player in the poultry industry, has been proactive in its efforts to combat this disease. The first campaign: a success story The first vaccination campaign, launched in 2023, was a landmark effort in the fight against Avian Influenza. The French government, in collaboration with leading pharmaceutical companies administered vaccines to millions of ducks. This campaign not only helped in controlling the spread of the virus but also provided valuable insights into the logistics and effectiveness of mass vaccination programs. The second campaign: building on success Encouraged by the positive outcomes of the first campaign, the French Ministry of Agriculture announced the second phase of the vaccination drive. This time, the government has ordered approximately 68 million doses of the vaccine, ensuring ample supply for the upcoming campaign. The cost of this initiative is estimated to be around 100 million euros, with the government covering 70% of the expenses.Continue after advertising. Objectives and implementation The primary objective of the second vaccination campaign is to further reduce the incidence of Avian Influenza in France and safeguard the poultry industry. The campaign will focus on vaccinating ducks, which are particularly susceptible to the virus. By immunizing a significant portion of the duck population, the government aims to create a buffer against potential outbreaks, thereby protecting both animal and public health. Challenges and considerations While the first campaign was largely successful, it also highlighted several challenges. Logistics, such as the distribution of vaccines and coordination among various stakeholders, were critical factors that required meticulous planning. The second campaign will benefit from the lessons learned, with improved procedures and strategies to ensure a smoother implementation. Moreover, the gradual shift of financial responsibility from the government to the poultry sector is a notable aspect of this campaign. Last year, the government funded 85% of the vaccination costs, but this year, the contribution has been reduced to 70%. This transition aims to encourage greater involvement and investment from the industry itself. Global implications France’s proactive approach to combating Avian Influenza sets a precedent for other countries facing similar challenges. The success of these vaccination campaigns demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of large-scale immunization efforts. As the threat of Avian Influenza continues to loom, international collaboration and knowledge sharing will be crucial in developing comprehensive strategies to protect the global poultry industry. Conclusion France’s second commercial vaccination campaign against Avian Influenza H5N1 marks a significant step in the ongoing battle against this deadly virus. By building on the success of the previous campaign and addressing the challenges encountered, France is poised to enhance the resilience of its poultry sector. This initiative not only safeguards the nation’s agricultural economy but also contributes to global efforts in controlling Avian Influenza.

From: Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs and Animal and Plant Health Agency Published 27 August 2024 Work to understand how avian influenza behaves in wild bird and mammal populations will be accelerated with the launch of a new £2.3 million research consortium it has been announced today (27 August). Scientists from the UK’s world leading Animal Plant Health Agency (APHA), alongside the British Trust for Ornithology, RSPB, NatureScot, and various academic institutions will collect and analyse samples from a range of bird and mammal populations to better understand how the virus behaves and fill current gaps in understanding about its transmission within wild birds, as well as the wider risks to mammals. The most recent outbreaks of the current H5N1 strain of high pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI), commonly known as bird flu, were the largest ever in the UK and devastated wild bird populations including seabirds such as gannets and black-headed gulls. This strain has also infected numerous species of wild mammals around the world, including otters and foxes in Great Britain. To improve the existing data on wild birds, teams from across the consortia are sampling different bird species under license to assess the presence of active infection or antibodies from previous exposure to avian influenza viruses. This will help understand the extent to which native bird populations have developed an immune response to the virus and how the circulation of different avian influenza virus subtypes might impact upon the emergence of new notifiable avian influenza viruses. During the recent HPAI outbreak in GB, the genetic make-up of the H5N1 virus changed on multiple occasions following the exchange of genetic material between notifiable and non-notifiable viruses. This led to the emergence of the H5N1 virus in a broader range of species, which was a critical factor in the devastation of populations of great skua, gannets and various gull species. Evaluating the spectrum of notifiable and non-notifiable viruses that are circulating in different wild bird species will fill a huge knowledge gap in our understanding of the origin and risk of virus emergence. The research team will also consider the impact of avian influenza on wild mammals. In GB, mammals have been affected where they have likely scavenged on birds that have died from the disease. The project will assess the susceptibility of different species and the potential mechanisms by which the virus spreads between bird species and mammals and what role mammals might play in disease spread during an outbreak – such as via the feet and fur. The team will test mammals including rats, foxes and otters in high-risk environments - where there have been mass mortality events recorded in birds in the past two years - to understand whether exposure from infected wild birds and the carcasses of animals that have succumbed to infection has led to an antibody response. Professor Ashley Banyard, Influenza and Avian Virology workgroup leader at the Animal and Plant Health Agency, said: Having access to a wider range of samples will mean we can study avian influenza viruses in much greater detail to learn more about how they behave and interact and how this might affect future disease outbreaks. This vital research project brings together some of the leading ornithological organisations to help gather the samples, and ultimately, following diagnostic testing, increase our understanding of avian influenza viruses across bird populations within Great Britain. This will help APHA inform the development of future strategies to protect our wildlife and minimise the impacts of this awful disease on both animals and humans. Defra Deputy Chief Scientific Adviser Justine Betja said: This collaboration brings together a wealth of expertise to enhance our understanding of one of our most serious animal health challenges. The results from this co-ordinated scientific effort will be a vital contribution to our preparations for future disease outbreaks to help us protect the health of animals, humans and the environment. Between 2021-2023 the emergence of the current H5N1 strain of avian influenza saw the UK experience its largest ever outbreak of bird flu. The outbreak led to the death of 97 million birds globally (3.8 million in the UK), with significant consequences for agriculture and the environment. Thousands of wild birds tested positive for the virus across the country, with more than 90% of recorded bird flu detections in UK poultry happening during this period. HPAI was previously only seen as a seasonal risk with incursions into Great Britain being linked directly to wild bird migration. However, the shift in infection dynamics seen with H5N1 has meant that the virus has ‘over-summered’ in different avian species and has also extended beyond avian populations. By evaluating a broad range of species APHA will be able to define the likely impact of infection with different avian influenza viruses on different populations, not just where infection has caused clinical disease, but also where these viruses circulate in the absence of clinical disease. This new, multidisciplinary project, funded by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, will enhance our understanding of the factors behind the spread and evolution of avian influenza viruses, including the apparent decline in cases since January 2024 and the potential drivers behind this. The work, which will run until next year, will inform future risk assessments and strategies for disease control in both animal and human populations. It takes a One Health approach, recognising the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health in addressing the risks posed by emerging infectious diseases.

Pay Pay $49.99/Year + Go Ad-Free! The Humane League has reported a distressing milestone in the ongoing Avian Influenza crisis in the United States. Since February 2022, over 100 million birds have been deliberately culled following the detection of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) on farms. The majority of these, more than 77 million, were egg-laying hens confined in large-scale concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs), where a single outbreak often leads to the deaths of over a million birds. The primary method used for culling is Ventilation Shutdown (VSD), a practice that involves sealing off ventilation in barns and increasing temperatures until the animals succumb to heatstroke or suffocation. This process, which can take several hours, subjects the animals to extreme suffering. Originally intended for severe disease outbreaks, VSD is now being used as a cost-saving measure, a misuse that The Humane League condemns. Dayne Alexander, Senior Corporate Research Lead at The Humane League, described the use of VSD as “nothing short of torture,” criticizing the corporate agriculture industry for treating animals as disposable commodities. The American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) recommends VSD+—an even harsher variant—only as a last resort, but achieving the intended rapid death rate is often impractical, leading to prolonged suffering for the animals. Despite the AVMA’s guidelines, financial incentives from the Department of Agriculture have encouraged the continued use of these inhumane practices. Last year, poultry producers received over half a billion dollars in compensation, with major companies like Jennie-O Turkey Store and Tyson Foods among the largest beneficiaries.

A recent study conducted in a colony of wild birds in southern Japan reveals that flies could unexpectedly play a role in spreading this virus. Illustration image Pixabay Researchers from Kyushu University have identified meat flies as carriers of the avian influenza virus. Attracted to decomposing flesh and feces, these flies represent a potential new transmission route. Published in Scientific Reports, this study calls for new prevention strategies for poultry farms. Since 2020, avian influenza has spread rapidly, causing the death of millions of wild birds and the culling of over 500 million poultry. In Japan, the 2022-2023 winter season recorded a record number of 326 avian influenza outbreaks, leading to the culling of 17.7 million birds. Transmission to mammals and the increasing cases among poultry workers raise significant concerns. In this research, scientists studied a colony of cranes in Izumi, where the high density of birds makes them vulnerable to infections. Last winter, 1,600 cranes died from avian influenza. Researchers collected 648 meat flies, finding that 14 of them carried the virus, mainly near the crane colony. Unlike birds and mammals, flies ingest the virus from dead birds or their feces, with the virus remaining infectious for up to two days. Capable of flying 1.2 miles (2 km) per day, they could potentially reach nearby poultry farms. Researchers estimate that flies can contaminate surfaces, food, and water sources, thus infecting healthy birds. Closed-farm systems in Japan can integrate fly control measures, such as fine nets or insecticides, to reduce the risk of virus spread. However, these measures are challenging to implement in open-air farms and among wild bird populations. Fujita and his colleagues are working with the government to capture flies in quarantine areas around infected farms, to prove their role in outbreaks. They are also developing tools using artificial intelligence to assess and predict the risks posed by vector insects, aiming to better understand and control the spread of avian influenza and other insect-borne diseases.

(ABC Rural: Jane McNaughton)abc.net.auews/bird-flu-outbreak-wargaming-preparation-get-results/104169402Link copiedShareShare articleIt has been over 100 days since Victoria's largest outbreak of bird flu began and there are positive signs for the industry as farms begin to recover from the fallout.Agriculture Victoria has confirmed an affected farm has started restocking poultry and officials have begun to scale back quarantine operations after two months with no positive detections of the disease.Thousands of people have been working behind the scenes screening, researching, and analysing to help keep the outbreak under control.One of those is senior research scientist in virology at Agriculture Victoria, Dr Peter Mee, who has been a busy man over the past few months."There was a flurry of activity when we saw the [first] positive result come through. You have some dread," he said."It's been quite an event — processing thousands of samples seven days a week, every week, for a few months now."The team is pretty amazing here."Dr Peter Mee says they are aiming to detect disease before there are clinical presentations. (ABC Rural: Jane McNaughton)Busy biosecurity labsDr Mee works in the AgriBio Lab at Bundoora's Latrobe University Campus where swab tests from chickens in quarantine zones are delivered and tested daily to inform the government's biosecurity response."It's been interesting seeing the outbreak and trying to provide that quick turnaround time of diagnostics to support the response, and farmers, in understanding what's going on here," he said."We do extractions to pull out the nucleic acid, the genetic code, and then we set up our tests that are specific for avian influenza on our machines."We routinely get a range of samples from everywhere but recently it's mainly been those quarantine zones, and also if there's backyard flocks or areas that look a little bit suspect they'll come through to us."The testing by Ag Vic is gold standard, and efficiencies casting a wider net are being trialled. (ABC Rural: Jane McNaughton)Research director Grant Rawlin is one of about 150 people who have been on the scene since the outbreak began in May, working from a mobile diagnostics van parked on the farm at the centre of the outbreak."Control of highly infectious diseases is all about speed so the closer you can get to where the virus is the less delays you've got," he said."This van allows us the organise everything so we get results within 24 hours so we were able to get as close to in front of the virus as you possibly can."Grant Rawlin has worked as a veterinarian for 30 years (ABC Rural: Jane McNaughton)As a result of the outbreak, all 400,000 birds on site at the farm needed to be euthanased.The veterinarian of 30 years said that although this was not his first response to an emergency animal disease outbreak it was by far the largest."Is it complex and stressful? Yes. But you just do it," he said.Complex operationA mobile diagnostics research department has been set up in a van so scientists can quickly test for animal diseases. (ABC Rural: Jane McNaughton)Victorian broiler sheds can house up to 50,000 chickens each and Dr Rawlin said fatalities were common.However, in an avian influenza outbreak, all animal deaths were concerning."We've got a high risk district around here. All of the dead birds are collected by courier and they're brought to the van so we can swab those birds," Dr Rawlin said.Up to 50,000 chickens can be housed in sheds in on Victorian chicken farms. (ABC News: Kyle Harley)"These are large numbers of birds on these farms and it's hard to see individuals get sick."It's been quite powerful. We've picked up outbreaks before they were clinically apparent."Dr Mee said the department had been busy preparing for a large outbreak since Victoria's last incursion in 2020."We did some mock scenarios earlier in the year," Dr Mee said."If there were hanging points that were slowing down processing we could iron out those kinks before we had the real detections."Dr Rawlin said the wargaming was also useful out in the field."Without the simulations, what we've done here would have been much, much more difficult," he said."Those exercises show us holes we were able to fill. When reality hits it operates so much better."The diagnostics van is set up to detect disease on-farm. (ABC Rural: Jane McNaughton)There's an animal pandemic sweeping the world. Will humans be next?Photo shows A person in a white protective suit stands next to a lake holding a dead crane. Australia is one of the last places on the planet free from high pathogenicity bird flu. But authorities warn there's an increased risk of an outbreak here as scientists say the world is in an animal pandemic.Preparing for bigger threatsAs the recovery response begins to conclude, government and industry have the looming threat of a more contagious strain of bird flu that has wreaked havoc overseas which could be in Australia as soon as this spring.Dr Rawlin said he was confident the team could rise to the challenge."After we've done this work basically it's the same sort of thing," he said."There will be a lot more interaction with human health and wildlife, but as far as we're concerned the systems are pretty much the same whatever emergency animal disease comes in."Agriculture Victorian vans and trucks are on site at an egg farm near Meredith to help detect disease. (ABC Rural: Jane McNaughton)Trails are underway in a bid to detect disease at earlier stages.Dr Mee said although PCR testing was the gold standard it was a labour-intensive exercise to swab test individual birds, so they were trialling air quality testing of locations such as chicken sheds for disease.The technology is being developed alongside tests to detect "high volume samples" of viruses that can affect humans, such as COVID.Airborne disease detecting devices are being used in trials. (ABC Rural: Jane McNaughton)"We want to see if we can detect it before there are clinical presentations on an animal," Dr Mee said."It's trying to sample a larger number of animals to potentially capture it earlier and provide that earlier warning that could go to farmers and industry bodies to advise a disease could be circulating in an area."The clean up and testing of the affected farms will continue for a number of months so Victoria can declare "proof of freedom" and resume normal trading conditions.ABC Rural RoundUp newsletterStories from farms and country towns across Australia, delivered each Friday.Your information is being handled in accordance with the ABC Privacy Collection Statement.Email addressSubscribePosted Sat 31 Aug 2024 at 9:00pmSaturday 31 Aug 2024 at 9:00pmSat 31 Aug 2024 at 9:00pm, updated Sun 1 Sep 2024 at 7:40amSunday 1 Sep 2024 at 7:40amSun 1 Sep 2024 at 7:40amShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Top StoriesFamily shares tribute for Eleanor Bryant, teacher's aide killed when truck crashed into preschoolTopic:Road Accidents and IncidentsPhoto shows Eleanor Bryant, who was killed when a truck crashed into a Victorian preschool, pictured smiling at the races.Early election speculation reaches a fever pitch as Albanese announces two candidates in two hoursTopic:ElectionsPhoto shows A man in a black suit and a yellow tie stands at a podium, addressing the press and gesturing to the crowd.Donald Trump and the one big threat to Australia's almost $4 trillion superannuation systemDAnalysis by David TaylorPhoto shows SuperannuationUnder proposed laws the truth about COVID-19 could have been struck from the internetTopic:Social MediaPhoto shows A row of people looking at their phones with one set of hands and phone in focus.

Prev Next AP This photo provided by Moderna in August 2024 shows packaging and a syringe for the company's updated COVID vaccine for age 12 and older approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Thursday, Aug. 22, 2024. By: Justin Boggs Posted People across the country can now get COVID-19 and flu shots at their local pharmacy. Walgreens and CVS are two of the major retailers now offering the vaccines. The companies are accepting appointments on their websites for those wishing to get vaccinated.“Preventive vaccinations are the best way to protect yourself and your family from seasonal illnesses,” said Dr. Sree Chaguturu, executive vice president and chief medical officer of CVS Health. “Access to preventive vaccinations is critical to keeping our communities healthy. With thousands of CVS Pharmacy and MinuteClinic locations across the country, it’s easy to find and get a vaccination.”Kroger, the nation's largest chain of grocery stores, also has COVID-19 and flu shots available, in addition to RSV vaccinations. As well as appointments, Kroger said it will accept walk-ins."These illnesses can result in poor health, missed work, extra medical bills or even prevent an adult from being able to care for their family," said Dr. Marc Watkins, chief medical officer of Kroger Health. "We understand that people lead busy lives. That's why we've made it as easy as possible to get vaccinated at our stores. Customers can get their groceries and their vaccine(s) in one trip, saving them time and helping them be protected."Rite Aid also began offering new COVID-19 shots this week after starting to offer updated flu and RSV shots at the start of the month.The vaccines were made available after the Food and Drug Administration authorized their release last week amid a summer spike in cases. Instead of COVID-19 cases bottoming out in the summer, they have been on the rise this year.Who should get vaccinated?Here is the general guidance from the Centers for Disesae Control and Prvention on who should get which shot:COVID-19: Everyone ages 6 months and older should get a 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccine. ·Influenza: Everyone 6 months of age and older is recommended to get an annual influenza vaccine.RSV: Everyone ages 75 and older and adults ages 60-74 at increased risk of severe RSV, such as those with chronic heart or lung disease, certain other chronic medical conditions, and those who are residents of nursing homes or other long-term care facilities. Also infants and toddlers up to 24 months old. Those who are 32-36 pregnant between the months of September and January can also get vaccinated to pass antibodies onto their newborn.What is different about this COVID-19 vaccine?The FDA said that fall 2024 COVID-19 vaccines will target the KP.2 variant of the virus, which is a descendant of the JN.1 variant that widely circulated throughout the U.S. during the winter."This change is intended to ensure that the COVID-19 vaccines (2024-2025 Formula) more closely match circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains." the FDA said.Over the summer KP.3 and its descendants became the most prevalent strain of the virus. KP.3 and a descendant variant now account for over half of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. Like KP.2, KP.3 also mutated from the JN.1 variant.RELATED STORY | New study shows how common long COVID symptoms are for childrenKP.2 and KP.3 are known as FLiRT variants, because of their specific positions in the spike protein. Experts say these variants aren't more or less severe than previous variants, but more people have antibodies through vaccines and prior infection to better fight off an infection.But as COVID-19 mutates, the body loses its ability to fight off the virus without vaccination or prior infection, experts say.Is now the right time to get a COVID-19 shot?Andy Pekosz, a professor in molecular microbiology and immunology at Johns Hopkins, said there are several options for those considering getting an updated COVID-19 shot."People who have not had COVID in the past few months have a couple options," he said, "get the updated COVID vaccine as soon as it’s available to protect yourself as the wave of summer infections continues [or] get the updated COVID vaccine around mid-October to build protection in time for the rise of cases that typically occur around November through January."There are several factors that someone should weigh before deciding on the timing of a COVID-19 shot."People at higher risk of severe illness should consider getting an updated COVID vaccine as soon as possible," he said. "Everyone who is eligible should get an updated COVID vaccine by mid-October in order to build immunity ahead of holiday travel and gatherings. Remember, it takes about two weeks to build up immunity following a vaccine, so schedule your vaccination accordingly."RELATED STORY | Free COVID tests to be made available as experts anticipate winter surge Copyright 2024 Scripps Media, Inc.

According to the disease control director, 1,800 birds have been culled so far, but the number is expected to rise to 20,000 as the situation progresses. Experts warn that the H5N1 virus, which causes bird flu, has the potential to spread not only among birds but also to humans, pigs, and other animals. Authorities are taking necessary precautions to prevent the further spread of the virus and are urging the public to remain vigilant and follow safety guidelines to protect themselves from potential infection.

These viruses naturally spread among wild aquatic birds worldwide and can infect domestic poultry and other bird and animal species.While the H9N2 virus typically causes mild illness, further sporadic human cases could occur as the virus is one of the most prevalent avian influenza viruses circulating in poultry in different regions.Bird flu viruses do not normally infect humans, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). However, sporadic human infections with bird flu viruses have occurred. The CDC adds that there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission, and the risk to the general public is low. Animal influenza viruses usually circulate in animals but can also infect humans, typically through direct contact with infected animals or contaminated environments."Human infections with avian influenza viruses can happen when virus gets into a person’s eyes, nose or mouth, or is inhaled," says the CDC.Symptoms of bird flu infections in people have ranged from mild—such as eye infections and upper respiratory symptoms—to severe illness, including pneumonia, that have resulted in death. Conjunctivitis, sore throat, headache, runny nose, and muscle or body aches are other symptoms. The Mexican patient experienced symptoms like fever, shortness of breath, diarrhea, nausea, and general discomfort."CDC currently recommends treatment as soon as possible with flu antiviral drugs for people with suspected or confirmed influenza A(H5N1) virus infection. Antiviral treatment works best when started as soon as symptoms begin," advises the CDC.The CDC also recommends avoiding contact with surfaces that appear to be contaminated with animal feces, raw milk, litter, or materials contaminated by birds or other animals with suspected or confirmed avian influenza virus infection. Consuming uncooked or raw products contaminated by birds should also be avoided.(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)Read More News onbird fluPuri districtH5N1 outbreakTamiflu medicineavian influenzaindia bird fluodisha bird fluhuman bird flu(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

The move will reduce cost pressures on egg producers and packers and boost supply chains. From: Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs and Daniel Zeichner MP Published 27 August 2024 Egg producers and packers will no longer need to change how eggs are labelled during an outbreak of avian influenza under measures announced today by the Government (27 August). Currently, when mandatory housing measures are introduced to protect birds from the spread of disease, eggs from free-range birds can only continue to be labelled as ‘free-range’ for 16 weeks after the housing order has come into effect - the existing ‘derogation’ period under the Egg Marketing Standards Regulations. After that period, these eggs must then be labelled as barn eggs. In both 2021-22 and 2022-3, the 16-week derogation period was exceeded by six and seven weeks respectively, which led to significant costs for industry as egg packaging had to be changed to comply with legislation. The amends to existing legislation, which will be introduced through a Statutory Instrument later this year, will mean that free-range eggs can continue to be labelled as such throughout mandatory housing measures. The move will cut unnecessary red tape and costs for British producers while also strengthening supply chain and maintaining consumer confidence. Daniel Zeichner, Minister for Food Security and Rural Affairs said: We understand the pressures facing the egg producing sector and the crippling impact that avian influenza outbreaks can have on their businesses. Removing the need to change labels on eggs and packaging will help them keep costs down and remain competitive. This Government will restore stability and confidence in the sector introducing a new deal for farmers to boost rural economic growth and strengthen food security alongside nature’s recovery. The UK has self-declared freedom from HPAI for Great Britain with effect from 29 March 2024. There are currently no outbreaks of HPAI in poultry or other captive birds in the UK. However, HN51 continues to be found in wild birds in Great Britain and across Europe and keepers should remain vigilant and practice stringent biosecurity to protect the health and welfare of their birds. The proposal to remove this derogation period for England and Scotland was supported by the majority of respondents to an eight-week consultation undertaken earlier this year.

India has recorded only one H5N1 death in 2021.âThe transmission of the H5N1 virus to humans is rare. It could be fatal for humans if the viral load is high. People who handle infected birds are at risk. There is no risk in eating properly cooked chicken,â said Debdutta Bhattacharya, a scientist at ICMR-Regional Medical Research Centre (RMRC), Bhubaneswar. âChances of transmission from infected birds are high when people handle birds without protective gear like masks and gloves,â he said.Deepak Kumar Kar, a public health expert, said people should not get worried about the spread of bird flu at this stage. âWe do not know how much time it will take for transmission of avian influenza from one person to another. Previous data shows a very negligible rate of transmission from birds to humans,â he added.He said the best thing is to contain the disease at the source. âIf we do not control the infection in birds, there is a chance that it may start spreading to humans. Genetic changes in the avian influenza virus can prove fatal for people. We need to identify suspected cases and isolate them to stop transmission,â he added.A person infected by avian influenza (H5N1) virus will get symptoms like normal flu. âIf a person engaged in an affected poultry farm gets flu-like symptoms, he/she should stay in isolation and go for testing immediately,â said Susanta Kumar Dash, a professor at Odisha University of Agriculture and Technology (OUAT).He said transmission of the H5N1 virus from one bird to another in a poultry farm is easy. âBut transmission from birds to humans is difficult due to the presence of a genetic barrier. If we contain the transmission immediately by culling birds and sanitising the area, it will not create major problems,â he added.We also published the following articles recentlyOdisha to cull 20,000 birds in response to avian flu outbreakIn Puri district of Odisha, over 20,000 birds are being culled due to the detection of H5N1 avian influenza in Pipli town's poultry farms. The Animal Husbandry Department is conducting the culling and disinfection measures while advising residents to report any sick or dead poultry. Officials are closely monitoring the outbreak to ensure public safety.Deadly infection alert! This fast-spreading virus in horses can infect humans through mosquitoesEastern equine encephalitis (EEE) has been found in Hudson Valley, New York. The rare mosquito-borne virus can cause severe neurological complications and has a significant mortality rate. Health officials recommend preventive measures such as wearing long-sleeved clothing and avoiding mosquito bites. The virus particularly affects people over 50 and children under 15.Is droplets a source of Mpox transmission? What we know so farWHO has indicated that the mpox virus mainly spreads through close physical contact, such as skin-to-skin or mouth-to-skin contact, rather than droplets. The virus can also transfer during pregnancy or to infants through close contact. Research is ongoing to fully grasp the transmission dynamics and differences between Clade 1 and Clade 2 strains.About the AuthorHemanta PradhanHemanta Pradhan writes for the Times of India on education, hospital issues, transport, agriculture & tribal affairs.

Under the current legislation, when mandatory housing measures are introduced to protect against the spread of AI (avian influenza), eggs from free range birds can only continue to be labelled as ‘free range’ for 16 weeks after the housing order has come into effect. After this period, these eggs must then be labelled as barn eggs. Egg producers hold the majority of the risk associated with the loss of free range status after the current 16-week period expires and they are dependent on the goodwill of their customers to maintain their free range premium if eggs have to be re-classified as barn eggs. In both 2021-22 and 2022-23, the 16-week derogation period was exceeded by six and seven weeks respectively, which led to significant costs for the poultry sector as egg packaging had to be changed to comply with legislation. At the second annual Farm to Fork summit on 14 May 2024, the previous government confirmed that the 16-week derogation period would be removed, following responses to its consultation held in England and Scotland with key stakeholders, including the NFU. The new government has this week confirmed the amends to the existing legislation will be introduced through a statutory instrument later this year, allowing free range eggs to be labelled as such throughout mandatory housing measures. Level playing field Responding to the news, NFU Poultry Board chair James Mottershead said he was “pleased” to see that the amends would be made, adding that the removal of the 16-week derogation period forms one of the NFU’s four key asks on AI policy, dating back to October 2022. “It’s great to see that, during stressful times for poultry producers, any additional burden will now be minimised. This includes practical challenges and the excess costs associated with the previously required labelling changes,” he said. The NFU has consistently called for a GB-wide approach to egg marketing regulations and was therefore pleased to see the Welsh government announce its intention to consult on this same issue in addition to removing the 12-week grace period for free range poultry meat. “This move will be welcomed by producers and we hope to receive a further positive announcement for producers in Wales shortly.” NFU Poultry Board chair James Mottershead “This move will be welcomed by producers and we hope to receive a further positive announcement for producers in Wales shortly,” James continued. “Our overall aim for alignment across GB policy on this issue is crucial to ensure that producers are not left at a competitive disadvantage.” The change would bring domestic legislation in line with marketing regulations in the European Union, ensuring a more level playing field with European egg producers. Keepers to remain vigilant Making the announcement, Farming Minister Daniel Zeichner said the government understood pressures faced by egg producers and “the crippling impact that avian influenza outbreaks can have on their businesses”. “Removing the need to change labels on eggs and packaging will help them keep costs down and remain competitive.” The UK declared itself free from avian influenza since 29 March 2024. There are currently no outbreaks of the disease in poultry or other captive birds in the UK, however, it continues to be found in wild birds in Great Britain and across Europe and keepers should remain vigilant and practice stringent biosecurity to protect the health and welfare of their birds.

Photo: AFP/ Ernesto Benavides Clarification: This story has been updated to clarify between the effects and geographical spread of the H5 and H7 strains. As cases of bird flu mount overseas, New Zealand officials are bolstering their plans in case the virus arrives on our shores. Hundreds of millions of birds have now been destroyed around the globe due to infection with highly pathogenic strains of avian influenza, mostly the H5 and H7 strains. In June, the first human case of H5N2 died in Mexico, and this month, pet cats have been confirmed infected in the United States. Overseas officials are ramping up testing amid fears of infected beef being eaten by humans, while experts here at home are vaccinating native manu against the deadly virus. Here's what you need to know. Bird flu's spread overseas Avian influenza has been recorded as far back as 1878, but the current outbreak of H5N1 began in 2020 in Europe. From there, the virus spread to the Middle East, Asia, parts of Africa and the Antarctic peninsula, according to the US Centers for Disease Control. H5 strains have since spread from birds to at least 26 species of mammals, according to Harvard Health Publishing. Among them are mice, bears, foxes, dolphins, otters, alpacas, goats and hedgehogs. In Denmark, millions of mink have been culled after the virus spread through fur farms, and tens of thousands of seals and sea lions have died throughout the Americas, the BBC reported. Cases of bird flu have been confirmed in goats, among other mammals. Photo: 123RF This month, the Colorado Veterinary Medical Association reported six domestic cats in the US state had been diagnosed with the virus. This is not the first time it has threatened pets - in 12 cats died of bird flu in Poland and nearly 40 in South Korea. Their deaths were traced back to raw pet food that contained infected chicken and duck. The BBC estimates at least half a billion farmed birds have been slaughtered due to the H5 strains of bird flu. In the United States, nearly 200 dairy herds have been infected since March, when the virus jumped from wild birds to cows. The country's Department of Agriculture will in September begin testing beef entering the food supply over concerns the virus could be infecting meat, according to Reuters. New Zealand, Australia and the Pacific Islands remain free of the H5N1 strain. Also circulating are H7 strains, which have been the cause of outbreaks in Australia. In June, more than one million birds were slaughtered across Victoria to try to halt the spread of the virus. In July, ABC News reported nearly 10 percent of Australia's egg laying hens had been affected by the H7 outbreak. McDonald's stopped serving breakfast early to conserve its egg supply and supermarkets imposed restrictions on how many cartons of eggs could be purchased in one transaction. Human cases of bird flu Compared to bird flu's spread in animals, relatively few people have been infected so far, and the risk to human health is still classified as low. In 2020, there were 13 human cases of bird flu reported - mostly in China, with one each in Russia, Hong Kong and Senegal, according to the US Centers for Disease Control. The following year, 2021, was the deadliest of the epidemic for humans. There were 62 human cases reported in China, of whom 19 died, World Health Organization figures show. All but one of the deceased had the H5N6 strain. Over the next two years, human cases were reported in the United States (where the majority have been dairy farm workers), the United Kingdom, Cambodia, Vietnam, India, Mexico and Spain, according to the World Health Organization. Two further cases in China died in 2022, while a person from Mexico - the first confirmed human case of H5N2 - died in June. Australia reported its first human case of the H5N1 strain in May - a child who had likely contracted the virus while on holiday in India.

According to the World Health Organization, there have not yet been any cases of H5N1 that have been transferred from person to person. However, the virus is "constantly evolving" and could potentially become transmissible in that way. "If this occurs, it could be the start of a new influenza pandemic, as was the case with the 1918 and 2009 H1N1 pandemics." The situation in New Zealand New Zealand has never had a case of highly pathogenic avian influenza, but the Ministry for Primary Industries has been monitoring its movement around the world for more than 20 years, chief veterinary officer Dr Mary van Andel says. "New Zealand's geographical isolation has protected us from HPAI in the past, but we can't rely on it forever. Given the unpredictable journey of wild birds who can travel with HPAI, it may still arrive here." The ministry is most concerned about the H5N1 strain, and is developing a response plan alongside the Department of Conservation, Ministry of Health, Te Whatu Ora and key sector groups, van Andel says. That will cover surveillance, biosecurity, wild bird populations and human health. This month, representatives from the ministry and the poultry industry visited the United Kingdom to meet with experts and learn about the British response to the H5N1 strain. A small delegation visited Victoria in July. Some takahē have been vaccinated against bird flu. Photo: RNZ / Angus Dreaver "Although Australia does not have H5N1, the strain of HPAI we are particularly concerned about, its response to the current H7 outbreak provided useful insights for the New Zealand delegation," van Andel says. "Both trips will be used to sharpen ongoing operational planning and building of sector resilience at home." The ministry is working closely with the poultry industry to strengthen on-farm biosecurity and resilience, with the aim of reducing the impact on the sector and ensuring the domestic supply of poultry meat and eggs, she says. "We are also working closely with New Zealand's wildlife hospitals, poultry industry groups, veterinarians, wildlife hospitals and rehabilitation centres on monitoring and awareness to enable early detection." The Dunedin Wildlife Hospital is surveilling migratory wild birds and shorebirds and sampling for bird flu, and the ministry is working with Fish & Game to conduct summer surveillance programmes for waterfowl, she says. Meanwhile, the Department of Conservation has vaccinated 50 native birds, including takahē, kākāpō, tūturuatu, kakī and kākāriki, as part of a trial to see if it is an effective line of defence, The Guardian reported. The birds, which are about to undergo six-month efficacy tests, are all part of DOC's breeding programmes. Meanwhile, van Andel says, anyone who sees three or more sick or dead birds is encouraged to report it to the Exotic Pest and Disease hotline on 0800 80 99 66.

Influenza star shares ‘considerate and understanding’ as qualities in potential boyfriend follow us share Jisoo: Image from YG Entertainment BLACKPINK’s Jisoo is currently gearing up to make her acting comeback with the upcoming zombie drama Newtopia (previously known as Influenza). Ahead of the highly-anticipated premiere, in a recent interview, she discussed her ideal type, saying she wants to be with somebody who is considerate and understanding. For the promotion of her upcoming drama Newtopia, Jisoo recently appeared in an interview with Marie Claire. When asked to describe the character traits she finds attractive in a partner, the BLACKPINK member answered, “Someone who knows to acknowledge. Acknowledging something different from themselves shows that they have a big heart”. Discussing her ideal type, the K-pop star revealed that it’s important that the person who respects others is considerate and understanding. She added that her preferred person should have secured self-esteem that allows them to willingly lower themselves when needed. "I think people who courageously acknowledge their mistakes or shortcomings are also beautiful”, said Jisoo. Overall, the FLOWER hitmaker’s ideal type is someone with a relaxed inner self. Since the beginning of her K-pop career in 2016 till now, Jisoo has only been in one confirmed relationship. Back in August 2023, YG Entertainment announced that the BLACKPINK member is dating My Name fame actor Ahn Bo Hyun. Their budding romance was well-received by the fans. However, just two months later in October 2023, the two Korean stars confirmed their breakup. Their agencies revealed that Jisoo and Ahn Bo Hyun’s relationship naturally became distant due to their busy schedules. On the work front, Jisoo is currently gearing up for the release of her upcoming drama Newtopia, co-starring Park Jung Min. The series is set to premiere sometime this year. Meanwhile, the K-pop idol seems to be focusing on her acting career more than ever.Advertisement She has recently wrapped up the filming schedule for her first film Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint, starring Lee Min Ho, Ahn Hyo Seop, Chae Soo Bin, and more A-list Korean actors. In 2025, she is set to resume group activities for BLACKPINK’s highly-anticipated comeback and a world tour following a new album release. Meanwhile, she is also focusing on her solo music career under her new agency BLISSOO.

Video / NZ HeraldOne of the biggest flu seasons in years is likely to drag on well into spring, doctors say, as hospitals and GP clinics continue to see high case numbers.And while the worst of the sick season is likely now behind us, people are being urged to get their flu shots if they haven’t yet.ESR surveillance showed weekly hospitalisations of people with severe acute respiratory illness (Sari) in Auckland are still tracking far higher than the 2015-19 average, as well as rates from the last two years.At the wave’s peak in late July, there were 125 hospital cases of severe respiratory infections in the region in one week - about a third more than the same time in 2023 - prompting a plea from health agencies for people to get vaccinated and stay home if sick.Since then, weekly numbers had eased slightly to just over 100, ESR data for mid-August showed.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.ESR surveillance showed weekly hospitalisations of people with severe acute respiratory illness (Sari) in Auckland are still tracking far higher than the 2015-19 average, as well as rates from the last two years. Source / ESR“While rates are now decreasing as we move into late August and early September, we are remaining vigilant,” Health New Zealand - Te Whatu Ora national clinical director Dr Susan Jack said.Though the data only showed activity in Auckland, Jack said it was a good barometer of illness levels likely being experienced by hospitals across the country.GP clinics were also still busy dealing with flu cases, Royal New Zealand College of General Practitioners medical director Dr Luke Bradford said.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.“Anecdotally, we are still seeing a lot of respiratory presentations across the country, the South Island is particularly hard-hit at present,” he said.“We expect these illnesses at this time of year, but there does seem to be more influenza around this year than in the last couple.”There’d also been six serious outbreaks involving respiratory viruses around the country over mid-August, five of them in aged residential care facilities.National calls to Healthline for flu-like illnesses - mostly involving babies and young children - continued to run higher than the 2015-19 average.ESR virologist Dr Sue Huang said the busy flu season had been driven by influenza A strains spreading in tandem.Those were H3N2 and “swine flu” H1N1 - both of which were known to hit elderly people and kids particularly hard.“They have been circulating side-by-side and peaked only two weeks apart, which contributed to the very high number of flu cases at hospitals.”Bradford said most cases seen by GPs were also presenting with influenza A, “as this makes them feel very unwell, and they are more likely to get checked by their doctors”.ESR virologist Dr Sue Huang. Photo / Mark MitchellIn late January, influenza A happened to be implicated in an outbreak that killed six residents of a Whitianga rest home.Huang said doctors had meanwhile seen little of influenza B, which swept back into New Zealand last year with H1N1 after a years-long absence.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.“That’s the only unknown for us at the moment - whether we’ll see influenza B play up before the end of the season.”Otherwise, flu rates were expected to keep tracking down into spring.Going by past post-peak patterns, Bradford anticipated flu levels should drop over the next four weeks, “so we should see levels right down by October”.Flu wasn’t the only viral nasty keeping clinics busy, with Covid-19 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) also spreading widely over winter.Health NZ reported just over 100 Covid cases in hospital as of last Sunday - still roughly one-quarter of the number recorded at the last wave’s peak in late May.ESR’s latest surveillance showed while numbers of acute RSV cases among kids had crept up in Auckland over mid-August, levels were still generally low.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Jack said health authorities continued to encourage people to stay well and out of hospital by getting vaccinated and following other public health advice.Royal New Zealand College of General Practitioners medical director Dr Luke Bradford. Photo / George Novak “Getting immunised against influenza, which remains free for everyone aged 65 and over, pregnant people and many others, provides good protection against various strains of flu that are currently circulating,” she said.“Annual influenza vaccination is recommended for everyone over 6 months of age.“It’s not too late to get your influenza vaccination.”Before Covid-19 arrived, flu was New Zealand’s single deadliest infectious disease, killing around 500 Kiwis each year.Health experts have suggested Covid could again claim more lives than flu in 2024, although the toll could be slightly lower than the 1300-plus deaths reported last year.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Jamie Morton is a specialist in science and environmental reporting.

As part of containment measures, over 20,000 birds are set to be culled to prevent the spread of the virus to other regions. The Animal Husbandry Department has initiated the culling process, which is expected to continue for several days. Local officials are ensuring that all protocols are strictly followed during the operation. In addition to culling, extensive disinfection measures are being implemented in the affected areas to control the virus’s spread. Residents in Pipili have been advised to avoid contact with birds and to report any sick or dead poultry to authorities immediately. To further prevent the virus from spreading, a temporary ban on the sale and transport of poultry products from the region has been imposed. The situation is being closely monitored by health and veterinary authorities, with efforts focused on containing the outbreak and ensuring public safety. Animal influenza viruses normally circulate in animals but can also infect humans. Infections in humans have primarily been acquired through direct contact with infected animals or through indirect contact with contaminated environments. Dr Jaganath Nanda, Additional Director of Disease Control at the Directorate of Animal Husbandry, Odisha, said, “On August 17, we received a report from the Pipili area indicating that 1,800 birds had died under unusual circumstances. A team was immediately dispatched to the site to collect samples, which were then sent to Bhopal for testing. The results, received on August 23, confirmed the presence of bird flu. Consequently, culling operations commenced on August 24 in both the Pipili and Satyabadi blocks. The culling process is going on and we will pay Rs 20 and Rs 70 for as per their size.” The state’s Health and Family Welfare Department, posted on X and informed that Dr Nilakantha Mishra, Director, Public Health Dept., has directed CDMO Puri to remain prepared for the protection of human health due to the ongoing outbreak of bird flu in the district. “As two blocks of Puri district, Pipili & Satyabadi, are affected by the outbreak of BirdFlu, Dr Satya Panigrahi, State RRT & Sunita Jena, Epidemiologist, SSU, are directed to proceed to Puri to investigate and ensure the culling operation as per the guidelines,” it posted.
