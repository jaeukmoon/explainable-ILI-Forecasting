While flu seasons vary in severity, during most seasons, people 65 years and older bear the greatest burden of severe flu disease. CDC and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) preferentially recommend the use of higher dose flu vaccines (including high-dose inactivated and recombinant) or adjuvanted inactivated flu vaccine over standard-dose unadjuvanted flu vaccines for people 65 years and older. CDC recommends prompt flu antiviral treatment for people who have flu or suspected flu and who are at higher risk of serious flu complications, such as people 65 years and older. How age affects risk People 65 years and older are at higher risk of developing serious flu complications compared with young, healthy adults. This increased risk is due in part to changes in immune defenses with increasing age. While flu seasons vary in severity, during most seasons, people 65 years and older bear the greatest burden of severe flu disease. In recent years, for example, it’s estimated that between 70 percent and 85 percent of seasonal flu-related deaths have occurred in people 65 years and older, and between 50 percent and 70 percent of seasonal flu-related hospitalizations have occurred among people in this age group. Specific flu shots for people 65 years and older CDC and ACIP preferentially recommend the use of higher dose flu vaccines (high-dose inactivated and recombinant) or adjuvanted inactivated flu vaccine over standard-dose unadjuvanted flu vaccines for people 65 years and older. This recommendation is based on a review of available studies which suggests that, in this age group, these vaccines are potentially more effective than standard dose unadjuvanted flu vaccines. If one of these vaccines is not available at the time of administration, people in this age group should get a standard-dose unadjuvanted inactivated flu vaccine instead. There are other flu vaccines approved for use in people 65 years and older. People 65 years and older should not get a nasal spray vaccine.

Sept. 18, 2024 Prevention A flu vaccine is the best protection against flu The best way to protect against flu and its potentially serious complications is with an annual flu vaccine. Flu vaccination has many benefits. It has been shown to reduce the risk of getting sick with flu and also to reduce the risk of more serious flu outcomes that can result in hospitalization or even death. Although immune responses to vaccination may be lower in older people, studies have consistently found that flu vaccination has been effective in reducing the risk of medical visits and hospitalizations in older people. Higher dose and adjuvanted flu vaccines are potentially more effective than standard dose unadjuvanted flu vaccines for people in this age group and are therefore recommended preferentially over a regular dose flu vaccine. Flu vaccination timing For most people who need only one dose of influenza vaccine for the season, September and October are generally good times to be vaccinated against influenza. Ideally, everyone should be vaccinated by the end of October. Most adults, especially those 65 years and older, should generally not get vaccinated early (in July or August) because protection may decrease over time. However, early vaccination can be considered for any person who is unable to return at a later time to be vaccinated. Pneumococcal vaccination is also important Having flu increases your risk of getting pneumococcal disease. Pneumococcal pneumonia is an example of a serious flu-related complication that can cause death. People who are 50 years and older also should be up to date with pneumococcal vaccination. This vaccination helps protect against pneumococcal pneumonia and other serious infections. You can get the pneumococcal vaccine your provider recommends when you get a flu vaccine. Talk to your health care provider to find out which pneumococcal vaccines are recommended for you. Keep Reading: Pneumococcal VaccinationOther preventive actions In addition to getting a flu vaccine, everyone should take everyday preventive actions, including avoiding people who are sick, covering coughs and sneezes, and washing hands often. This also can include taking steps for cleaner air and hygiene practices like cleaning frequently touched surfaces.

In 2010 he became an assistant professor in the Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics at Stockholm University where he used his expertise in biochemistry and secretory protein folding to establish a research group that examined the maturation and evolution of the influenza virus surface antigen, neuraminidase (NA). He also received the 2018 Stockholm University teacher of the year award. In 2019, Dr. Daniels joined the Laboratory of Pediatric and Respiratory Viral Diseases (LPRVD) in the Division of Viral Products (DVP), in the Office of Vaccine Research and Review (OVRR) at CBER. His group focuses on increasing influenza vaccine efficacy and cross protection by developing methodologies for improving the response against the NA antigen in vaccines and for assessing NA in circulating strains and vaccine preparations. General Overview Influenza viruses are estimated to cause symptomatic infections in 3-11% of the U.S. population annually and severe disease in about 1.5% of those infected. Although several drugs now available can limit the severity of an influenza infection, yearly vaccination remains the most effective approach to reduce the disease burden caused by influenza viruses. Current influenza vaccines include split inactivated influenza viruses, live attenuated influenza viruses, and recombinant hemagglutinin (HA) antigens. Each vaccine type has advantages and all of them protect against the two influenza A subtypes (H1N1 and H3N2) and at least one of the influenza B lineages (Yamagata and Victoria) that are responsible for seasonal infections in humans. Manufacturing split inactivated influenza vaccines generally involves propagating candidate vaccine viruses (CVVs) in eggs or mammalian cells, whereas recombinant HA vaccines are produced using insect cells. Despite these differences, both products are standardized based on the HA antigen content, as responses against HA correlate well with protection. Each season, several inter-connected challenges can affect the influenza vaccine efficacy: 1) Influenza viruses are constantly evolving, which can cause antigenic drift and occasional antigenic shift in type A viruses; 2) vaccine strains must be selected months in advance to meet manufacturing deadlines; 3) viral propagation in eggs or cells can lead to unexpected adaptations that can alter important antigens in the vaccine. Although influenza vaccines have mainly been developed to generate an optimal immune response against HA, influenza viruses do possess a second, less abundant surface antigen, neuraminidase (NA). Like HA, antibodies that recognize NA can provide both matched and cross-protection against influenza virus strains. NA also evolves and drifts independently of HA. These properties imply that by improving the NA response, it might be possible to increase the breadth of the vaccine coverage and mitigate many of the yearly challenges that influenza vaccines face. In the split inactivated and the live attenuated influenza virus vaccines, NA is present. However, many technical issues must first be solved before the NA component of the annual vaccines can be regulated. Our laboratory is systematically addressing several of these issues to establish a framework for improving the ability of NA to increase the breadth and efficacy of the annual vaccine. Scientific Overview Influenza viruses contain two surface antigens, the receptor-binding protein, hemagglutinin (HA), and the receptor-destroying enzyme, neuraminidase (NA). However, influenza vaccines have primarily been developed using methodologies centered on the more abundant HA antigen. Our long-term objectives are to increase the breadth and efficacy of the annual influenza vaccine by establishing a similar framework for assessing the NA antigen. To reach this goal, we are working to create methods capable of rapidly monitoring changes in NA antigenicity and to define the NA parameters that correlate with protection. We will use these parameters to assess the immunogenic NA content during the vaccine manufacturing process and to determine if the quantity is sufficient. In parallel, we are developing approaches to increase the NA content in CVVs, retain its immunogenicity throughout the different manufacturing processes, and to rationally design NAs for improved immunogenicity in recombinant-based vaccines. Within the lab, these objectives are separated into the following research areas: 1) NA assay development for characterizing circulating strains; 2) engineering CVVs to increase NA responses from viral-based vaccines; 3) rationally designing recombinant NAs for improved production and immunogenicity. We address each research area using a similar systematic approach that generally involves in vitro biochemical analysis followed by validation tests that include cell-based assays and in vivo animal models. The techniques we utilize include: enzyme kinetics, protein/viral purification, analytical assays, viral reverse genetics with propagation in cells and eggs, and viral immunization and challenge models. This broad range of approaches are carried out using the most up to date equipment and techniques so that advancements in one area of vaccine manufacturing can be rapidly assessed in another. The results from this work will likely help to establish the frameworks that are necessary to better utilize the NA antigen in the influenza vaccine and to identify the NAs in circulating strains that will provide the greatest breadth of coverage for upcoming seasons. Together, these concepts should help to advance influenza vaccine manufacturing and to improve the efficacy of the yearly vaccine.

Here we report on the detection of clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 HPAIV in the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic regions of South Georgia and the Falkland Islands, respectively. We initially detected H5N1 HPAIV in samples collected from brown skuas at Bird Island, South Georgia on 8th October 2023. Since this detection, mortalities were observed in several avian and mammalian species at multiple sites across South Georgia. Subsequent testing confirmed H5N1 HPAIV across several sampling locations in multiple avian species and two seal species. Simultaneously, we also confirmed H5N1 HPAIV in southern fulmar and black-browed albatross in the Falkland Islands. Genetic assessment of the virus indicates spread from South America, likely through movement of migratory birds. Critically, genetic assessment of sequences from mammalian species demonstrates no increased risk to human populations above that observed in other instances of mammalian infections globally. Here we describe the detection, species impact and genetic composition of the virus and propose both introductory routes and potential long-term impact on avian and mammalian species across the Antarctic region. We also speculate on the threat to specific populations following recent reports in the area. Similar content being viewed by others Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b from Peru forms a monophyletic group with Chilean isolates in South America Article Open access 13 February 2024 Transatlantic spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 by wild birds from Europe to North America in 2021 Article Open access 11 July 2022 The global H5N1 influenza panzootic in mammals Article 24 September 2024 IntroductionFollowing the emergence and global expansion of A/goose/Guangdong/1/96 (GsGd)-lineage H5 high pathogenicity avian influenza viruses (HPAIV) there have been repeat epizootics in wild birds and poultry populations globally. This lineage spread globally, evolving into diverse clades classified according to the H5 haemagglutinin (HA) gene phylogeny1. In the autumn of 2021, the situation escalated considerably with the detection of a clade 2.3.4.4b HPAIV subtype H5N1 in Europe2. Subsequently, two unprecedented epizootic waves with this lineage in 2021/22 and 2022/23 were associated with mass mortality events in wild birds together with unprecedented numbers of incursions into poultry premises2,3,4,5,6. High levels of viral adaptation to wild bird species7, and increased fitness advantage through continued genetic reassortment8 likely underpin the broad impact infection has had across many avian species3. This wide host range has facilitated the transmission of the lineage across a large geographic area, including from Europe to North America9,10, where it has since rapidly expanded its range southward into South America via migratory avian species. Incursion into South American countries, starting in November of 2022, represented the first recorded instances of GsGd-lineage H5 HPAIV in the region11,12,13. Mass mortality events in the region have been particularly severe and reported across several different bird species in addition to marine mammals3,11,14, highlighting the extensive ecological impact of HPAIV and the ongoing threat it presents to naïve hosts.The Antarctic region includes the ice shelves, waters, and all the island territories in the Southern Ocean situated inside of the ‘Antarctic Convergence’ or ‘Antarctic Polar Front’, a marine belt encircling Antarctica where Antarctic waters meet those of the warmer sub-Antarctic15. Several islands are located inside the Antarctic region, including South Georgia, while the Falkland Islands among others are located outside the Antarctic Convergence in the sub-Antarctic zone (Fig. 1). There have been no previous reports of HPAIV inside the Antarctic region16,17. Antarctica and the sub-Antarctic islands possess unique ecosystems which support the population strongholds of several avian and marine mammal species. The relative isolation of these islands from human populations has provided species across the Antarctic with only limited protection from anthropogenic environmental change18. Indeed, wildlife populations in the Antarctic face a broad range of challenges from introduced species19, to longline fisheries20,21, and rapid climate change22,23,24. Several native bird species including wandering albatross (Diomedea exulans), macaroni penguins (Eudyptes chrysolophus), grey-headed albatross (Thalassarche chrysostoma), and white-chinned petrel (Procellaria aequinoctialis), are listed as either vulnerable or endangered25. Iconic long-lived species with late maturity, such as albatross, exhibit low resilience to rapid increases in population mortality26. High mortality disease outbreaks therefore represent a substantial threat to already vulnerable seabird populations27,28.Fig. 1: The Antarctic region showing locations of South Georgia and the Falkland islands.Map showing the locations of South America, the Falkland Islands, South Georgia, the Antarctic peninsula, and other major islands in the Antarctic region. The location of the Antarctic Convergence (Antarctic Polar Front) is indicated by a blue hashed line.Full size imageWhile geographically isolated, several Antarctic seabird species routinely range between the South Atlantic and Southern Ocean, visiting the South American coast to either forage or overwinter29. Brown skuas (Stercorarius antarcticus), kelp gulls (Larus dominicanus), southern giant petrel (Macronectes giganteus), and snowy sheathbills (Chionis albus) have previously been identified as potential vectors of infectious pathogens into this vulnerable ecosystem due to their migratory traits, scavenging behaviour, and previously identified roles as carriers of low pathogenicity avian influenza viruses (LPAIV)30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37. Evidence of LPAIV in the Antarctic region was first identified from serological studies in the 1980s38,39,40. A range of subtypes have since been reported (H140, H331, H435, H541, H632, H739, H931, and H1133) including genetic analysis of the influenza virus subtypes H4N735, H5N533,41, H6N832 and H11N233,42,43. In contrast to the more prevalent H11N2 influenza viruses, which likely circulate silently through local populations, H4-H6 subtypes were found to share high sequence similarity with viruses from South America, indicating more recent introduction events32,33,35. Evidence of LPAIV transmission to the continent from the Americas demonstrates the elevated risk of clade 2.3.4.4b H5 HPAIV being introduced to the Antarctic, encouraging researchers in 2022 to employ additional biosecurity measures while maintaining surveillance activities30,44. During the austral summer of 2022/23, sampling and surveillance was conducted at several sites in the Antarctic region, and as of March 2023, HPAIV had not been detected16.Here we describe the observation of morbidity and mortality events across different species as well as the positive detection of H5N1 HPAIV in a variety of species in South Georgia, inside the Antarctic region and the sub-Antarctic Falkland Islands. We detail the suspicion, diagnostic evaluation, and clinical presentations of HPAIV in the region. Genetic analysis is used to characterise potential introduction routes and the consequences of HPAIV circulation in this region are considered.ResultsCase description and virus detectionProvision for diagnostic investigation of avian influenza is limited in the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic regions. For some samples in the description below, local RT-PCR testing at the KEMH Pathology and Food, Water & Environmental Laboratory on the Falkland Islands was used to screen for the presence of avian influenza virus H5N1 viral RNA (vRNA). This was initially undertaken for a Southern Fulmar as described below and this detection, alongside the increase clinical disease and mortalities observed on South Georgia triggered shipment of samples to the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) and Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) International Reference Laboratory for avian influenza, swine influenza and Newcastle disease virus at the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA), Weybridge, UK for confirmatory and further diagnostic evaluation. An overview of both observations and testing is detailed below.On the 17th September, researchers of the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) on Bird Island, South Georgia (an island approximately 0.5 km Northwest of the main island of South Georgia) (Fig. 2A) discovered a single southern giant petrel showing behaviours indicative of loss of coordination, neurological twitching, and lethargy. This individual was observed being preyed and scavenged upon by brown skuas and other southern giant petrels (Macronectes giganteus). On 8th October, brown skuas were observed in the same locality showing lethargy, neck spasms, twitching, and an inability to fly, and by 10th October, bird mortality was seen on Bird Island, with the highest number of mortalities occurring at the roosting site of non-breeding birds. Swab samples were collected from the three brown skua (Stercorarius antarcticus) on 8th October 2023 and a further brown skua on the 11th October which were all later found dead on Bird Island. These initial sampling events all yielded PCR positivity for HPAIV H5N1. The series of sampling events and species testing positive from this point onwards are detailed in Table 1 and Supplementary Table S1.Fig. 2: Geographical distribution of H5N1 HPAIV detections from South Georgia and The Falkland Islands.A Map showing the location, species, and date of influenza positive samples collected from South Georgia. B Map showing the location, species, and date of influenza positive samples collected from the Falkland Islands. Locations with mortalities but no positive samples are also labelled.Full size imageTable 1 Summary of H5 HPAIV testing results from avian and mammalian species from South Georgia and the Falkland IslandsFull size tableBriefly, both brown skuas and kelp gulls then tested positive at two different locations on South Georgia (Hound Bay and St. Andrews Bay) on the 30th October with further gulls and skuas (Moltke Harbour) swabbed a day later (31st October) also testing positive. Further positive samples were taken on the 3rd (Harpon Bay) and 8th (Penguin River) November from both brown skuas and kelp gulls. Further escalation in mortality occurred by 17th November 2023, when 57 skuas were observed to have died at Bird Island although samples could not be retrieved. On the 27th of November a South Georgia shag tested positive from King Edward Cove alongside an Antarctic tern sampled dead on the 6th of December.Alongside avian species, in early December clinical disease consistent with mammalian infection with HPAIV was observed in colonies of southern elephant seal (Mirounga leonine) and Antarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus gazella) at Jason Harbour on South Georgia (Supplementary Table S2). Clinical presentation included difficulty breathing, with coughing and short sharp breath intake. Individuals also showed accumulation of viscous fluid around the nasal passage. Five southern elephant seals and 1 Antarctic fur seal from Jason Harbour collected on the 9th December tested positive for the virus (Supplementary Table S2).Overall, between the initial detection of HPAIV on the 8th of October and 9th December, from South Georgia a total of 33 avian carcasses and 17 mammalian carcasses were sampled including representatives of five different avian species and two mammalian species across eight different locations. Of these, 66% (n = 28/33 avian carcasses; n = 6/17 mammalian carcasses) tested positive for HPAIV H5N1.Concurrent to the events occurring on South Georgia, on 30th October, a southern fulmar (Fulmarus glacialoides) was reported dead on Stanley, Falkland Islands and tested positive for the virus (Fig. 2B). Numerous other swabs were taken from different avian species across the Falkland Islands (Supplementary Table 1) but only three black-browed albatross (Thalassarche melanophris) tested positive from Saunders Island (n = 1) and Steeple Jason (n = 2) being collected on the 19th and the 26th of November, respectively. In total between the 30th October and 10th December samples were taken and tested from a total of 13 carcasses from nine different bird species with 31% testing positive for HPAIV H5N1 (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S1).Virus isolationWherever samples tested positive for HPAIV H5N1, attempts to isolate viable virus were undertaken. From the samples collected from South Georgia, virus isolation was successful from two brown skuas and a kelp gull taken from Hound Bay on the 30th October, a brown skua and kelp gull collected from Moltke harbour on the 31st October, a kelp gull from Harpon Bay on the 3rd November and both a South Georgia shag and an Antarctic tern from King Edward Cove on the 27th November and the 6th December, respectively.Virus isolation was also successful from swabs taken from carcasses found dead on the Falklands Islands, including from samples from two southern fulmar collected on the 30th October and the 13rd November from the Falklands Islands, and from black-browed albatross from Saunders Island and Steeple Jason on the 19th November and the 26th November, respectively.From a mammalian perspective, no viable virus could be recovered from any of the samples testing positive by the generic AIV, HPAIV H5-specific assay and N1-specific rRT-PCR assays45,46,47,48 (Supplementary Table 2).Genomic and phylogenetic analysisWhilst successful virus isolation gave material for full virus genomic sequencing and analysis, wherever possible, samples for which only rRT-PCR detection was possible were also assessed for full genome generation and sequence analysis. A total of 20 full genomes were generated from avian samples and a further three full genomes were generated from samples collected from seals. These included ten full virus genomes from brown skuas (from Bird Island, Hound Bay, Moltke Harbour, and Penguin River); six full virus genomes from kelp gulls (from Hound Bay, Moltke Harbour, Harpon Bay, and Penguin River); and both a South Georgia shag and an Antarctic tern (both from King Edward Cove). A further avian full virus genome was generated from two Southern Fulmars, both from Stanley Island on the Falklands Islands (Supplementary Table S1).From a mammalian perspective we generated two full virus genomes from southern elephant seals (both from Jason Harbour); and one full virus genome from an Antarctic fur seal (from Jason Harbour) (Supplementary Table S2).Comparison of the full data set generated from samples described revealed that they shared 99.86–100% nucleotide identity across all eight influenza gene segments (Supplementary Table S3). The sequences generated were then analysed with representative global H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b full-genome sequences to assess genetic ancestry by inferring maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees (Supplementary Fig 1). The sequences from South Georgia and the Falkland Islands clustered with H5N1 viral sequences obtained from South America between October 2022 and October 2023, in particular Argentina, Uruguay, Peru, and Chile across all gene segments. All sequences from South Georgia and the Falkland Islands were genotyped according to the United States of America H5N1 schema, given the spread of these viruses from North to South America in early 202211, and found to be part of the B3.2 genotype49.To further investigate the introduction of H5N1 HPAIV into South Georgia and the Falkland Islands, representative H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b HA sequences from North and South America were used to perform time-resolved phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Fig 2). This analysis provided evidence for distinct, separate introductions of H5N1 into South Georgia and the Falkland Islands, with both sets of sequences sharing a common ancestor with sequences from South America dating back to July 2023 (Falkland Islands, range: December 2022 to November 2023) and August 2023 (South Georgia, range: February November 2023). However, both sets of sequences produced long branch lengths compared to South American sequences, potentially due to unsampled ancestry. The sequences from South Georgia formed a single monophyletic group suggestive of a single introduction, whilst those from the Falkland Islands formed a paraphyletic group, with sequences from Argentina and Brazil. To investigate the source of these introductions, a Bayesian stochastic search variable selection (BSSVS) analysis was performed using the country or location from which the sequences originated as a discrete trait and then the support for these transmissions was quantified using Bayes factors (BFs). This analysis demonstrated that Argentina was the likely source of H5N1 HPAIV for both South Georgia (moderate support with a BF of 3–10) and the Falkland Islands (very strong support with a BF of 30–100) (Fig. 3B). The spread of H5N1 HPAIV within South Georgia was then also investigated using the same approach (Fig. 3C). This analysis further supported that the initial introduction into South Georgia occurred on Bird Island, before onward spread to Penguin River (definitive support with a BF > 100), Hound Bay (strong support with a BF of 10–30) and Moltke Harbour (moderate support with a BF of 3–10). Interestingly, both Harpon Bay and Jason Harbour did not demonstrate a statistically relevant connection to Bird Island based on the BSSVS analysis, but also there was no connection between these sampling locations and any outside of South Georgia either. Nevertheless, this demonstrates that after introduction into South Georgia, H5N1 HPAIV was then spread onward to multiple locations across the islands, whereby it infected multiple avian and mammalian species.Fig. 3: H5N1 HPAIV transmission from the South American continent to Falkland Islands and South Georgia.A Maximum clade credibility (MCC) phylogeny of the HA gene by BEAST analysis.

From the mammalian samples, only a single amino acid change of interest (PB2 E627K in one southern elephant seal sequence from Jason Harbour) was observed. None of the sequences contained any of the other PB2 mutations of particular interest (i.e., T271A, K526R, Q591K or D701N) or any other mutations associated with adaptation to replication in mammals. Interestingly, a kelp gull sequence from Harpon Bay displayed a single amino acid change of interest, PB2 D701N, but no others. Both southern fulmar sequences obtained from the Falkland Islands contained Q591K and D701N mutations. There were also no mutations in either mammalian or avian species that would affect the susceptibility of this virus to antivirals (Supplementary Table S4). WGS read coverage for all sequences generated can be found in Supplementary Table S5.DiscussionSince the emergence and global expansion of Gs/Gd-lineage H5Nx HPAIV in 1996, Antarctica and Oceania were the only two continents in which it had not been detected. Moreover, until now, the Antarctic region remained the only major geographical region in which HPAIV had never been detected. The island of South Georgia lies in the Southern Ocean inside the Antarctic convergence, a marine belt encircling Antarctica which defines the Antarctic Region. The island is an area of high biodiversity and high conservation priority with multiple species being defined as vulnerable to the incursion of infectious diseases50,51,52. The Falkland Islands constitute a remote cluster of islands in the South Atlantic Ocean situated approximately 1500 km to the west of South Georgia. The Falkland Islands are situated outside of the Antarctic convergence, in the sub-Antarctic region. Both the Falkland Islands archipelago and South Georgia represent key areas that are host to significant avian biodiversity and the presence of HPAIV on these islands represents a significant risk to the susceptible bird populations. South Georgia is home to approximately 29 avian species which breed on the islands and is recognised as an ‘Important Bird Area’ by Birdlife International53. Therefore, any colony or population that comes under threat from an HPAIV outbreak on South Georgia may have direct impact upon the wider population of seabirds. Despite seabird colonies showing space partitioning between colonies54, there is often a high degree of species overlap within colonies. Often this is due to the movement of nonbreeders or juvenile birds55. It is therefore, not unreasonable to suspect that birds on South Georgia may freely interact, which may aid the spread of disease, as has been documented previously36,56. Indeed, in the northern hemisphere it has been found that northern gannets (Morus bassanus) increased their interactions due to high levels of colony prospecting from surviving birds56.The interlinkages between avian and mammalian species testing positive for H5N1, in closely linked ecosystems across the Antarctic region, means that there is potential for the virus to spread further and there have been reports of the virus being detected on mainland Antarctica57,58 as well as causing low level mortality events in penguins (APHA, unpublished results)58,59. Circumpolar and trans-Pacific migrants such as grey-headed albatross60, white-chinned petrel61, southern giant petrels, and northern giant petrels (Macronectes halli) may facilitate this spread. Indeed, phylogeographic analysis has suggested a dynamic geneflow between southern Atlantic populations and Macquarie Island (an island in the southwestern Pacific Ocean, about halfway between New Zealand and Antarctica)62, and as such the threat of transmission to New Zealand and Australasia must be considered.From a mammalian infection standpoint there have been several reports globally of wild aquatic mammals, including seals, being infected with H5Nx HPAIV since 2020, where infection has been attributed to the predation of sick or dead infected birds11,63,64. Information to date suggests that HPAIV infection in seals often leads to a neurological presentation that may not result in viral shedding being detected through standard swab sampling activities63. This may explain the initial lack of influenza vRNA detection in elephant seal swab samples taken in this study, despite the consistency of clinical presentation seen in elephant seals with that reported elsewhere. However, follow up invasive sampling clearly demonstrated that swab samples from elephant seals were positive for vRNA demonstrating the utility of tissue sampling. Whilst weather conditions prevented a thorough sampling of species from across the different islandsegions experiencing mortality events in seals, those achieved did include samples testing positive. Importantly, where mortality events continue to occur in cetacean species, the opportunity for infection of scavenging birds exists which may then continue the cycle of risk through the potential for disease events in birds and further shedding of virus into new environments. However, carcass removal, disposal and environmental clean-up is not an option. The Antarctic region is one of the most remote environments on earth and is the location of enormous breeding colonies of various avian species that may be susceptible, and succumb, to infection with HPAIV. Further, the potential for virus survival in this cold environment is increased and it may be that infectious virus remains for longer periods in carcasses preserved by the local climate. Local ecology of species could also influence the scale of impact throughout Antarctica. Although all species remain vulnerable to large scale infection events, it is possible that the density of animals may preclude some species from succumbing to viral spread65. For example, wandering albatross nest at low density (approximately 0.0022 nests per m2)66, which could limit spread between breeding individuals. However, non-breeding birds congregate in groups to display and dance67 which may provide opportunities for disease spread. Similar ecological considerations must be made when considering burrow nesting species (such as white-chinned petrel, diving petrel [Pelecanoides spp.], and prion species [small petrels in the genera Pachyptila and Halobaena]), which nest in separated burrow systems and may limit spread. Penguins are also susceptible to HPAIV, and mortality has been observed following infection68. Penguin species nest in high densities (dependent upon species ranging between 0.25 and 1.7 nests per m2)69,70, and although limited impact has been seen to date, if HPAIV does start to impact more significantly on penguin colonies, it could show rapid infection and spread. However, the current situation does not suggest that significant mortality events will be seen in penguin species. The report of an outbreak in Gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua) chicks has not resulted in dissemination and mortality events in adult birds59. Activities within the region are ongoing to track mortality events and autonomous authorities are on high alert to signal the potential for incursions across the broader area although as suggested previously the proximity of affected species, both avian and mammalian, suggests that penguins may be less susceptible to this genotype of the virus.Genomic analysis of the avian sequences obtained from South Georgia and the Falkland Islands suggested separate, distinct introductions of the B3.2 HPAIV genotype into the two locations. The B3.2 genotype emerged following co-infection (of a presumably avian host) with a viral descendant of the first GsGd HPAI virus detected in North America during 2021 (purportedly introduced from Europe) with a North American lineage virus. This genotype has been demonstrated to have been introduced into South America four times between October 2022 and March 202311. Analysis of all available full-genome sequences from South America demonstrated that 95% (184 of 193) of H5N1 HPAIV sequences corresponded to this genotype. Given the close geographical proximity of South Georgia and the Falkland Islands to South America, and that wild bird species are known to migrate between the mainland and these islands, it is not surprising that the B3.2 was detected as the cause of the disease events. The phylogenetic analyses undertaken demonstrated that the viruses detected in South Georgia and the Falkland Islands shared common ancestors with those detected in mainland South America from mid-2023 and further analyses demonstrated that Argentina was the likely source of HPAIV. However, the long branch lengths observed across all gene segments suggests unsampled evolutionary ancestry. Further to this, analysis of the sequences obtained from the sampling sites on South Georgia suggests that after the initial introduction, there was spread of HPAIV to multiple locations which is consistent with eye-witness accounts from the island.The observation that all sequences generated from positive samples across these sampling activities conducted on South Georgia cluster closely within a monophyletic group, along with the BSSVS analysis demonstrates a singular introduction and that they do not constitute a divergent lineage. Further, the mammalian sequences cluster amongst the avian sequences demonstrating that they are not forming a separate evolutionary lineage. Contrary to this, the two sequences from the Falkland Islands do not form a monophyletic group and cluster with sequences from Argentina and Brazil. However, assessment of whether this is the result of multiple, separate introductions is limited due to the small number of sequences available at the time of writing. Further sampling activities within the Falkland Islands should be considered to further investigate the introduction of H5N1.Critically, assessment of sequences derived from mammalian species did not indicate any adaptive mutations of increased risk to human populations. A single sequence from a single Southern elephant Seal sequence from Jason Harbour) contained the PB2 E627K mutation that is associated with adaptation to replication in mammalian species and a Kelp Gull sequence from Harpon Bay displayed PB2 D701N. Whilst the mutation at E627K is an early marker of mammalian adaptation, both further mutations in the PB2 gene and alterations to HA are required to define increased risk to human populations. No other mammalian or avian sequences investigated from South Georgia contained any of the other PB2 mutations of particular interest (i.e., T271A, K526R, Q591K or D701N). This contrasts with reports coming from sequences derived from mortality events in mammals across South America11,71,72,73. However, the two southern fulmar sequences obtained from the Falkland Islands contained Q591K and D701N mutations which match the mammal sequences from South America, potentially indicating different sources for introduction into the Antarctic region. The data generated here indicates that human populations on these islands are not at any increased risk from infection from these viruses. Further, there were no mutations that would affect the susceptibility to antivirals observed in the data generated in this study. Still, continual monitoring of the virus, especially where it appears to be the causative agents of mortality events in seals (and potentially further avian species where scavenging occurs on dead seals occurs), is critical to maintain an understanding of whether adaptive events may occur. Clearly, with continual infection events occurring in mammals globally it is of great importance to understand where mutations may represent a genuine zoonotic risk as well as understand where adaptations that have occurred in mammals become tolerated in avian species.In conclusion, whilst the H5N1 B3.2 HPAIV has been translocated to the fragile ecosystem in the sub-Antarctic region, the current impact appears to be relatively minimal for avian species with minimal impact upon penguin populations being reported to date. Further whilst infection and significant mortality events have been observed in both fur and elephant seals, there remains no evidence of viral adaptation for enhanced infection of mammals and, consequently no increased risk to the human populations on the islands is predicted. Whilst this data supports a low impact on penguin species and little to no risk to humans, the global release of data restricts a fulsome interpretation here. It is of high interest to understand what impact repeat introduction events may be having in the region. Currently, there are only a limited number of sequences deposited in public databases from H5N1 HPAIV detections in South America during summer 2023, which limits interpretation. This factor, as with countless other studies highlights the importance of real-time global data sharing as a key tool in understanding the emergence and spread of these viruses. The current lack of publicly available data precludes a conclusive assessment of potential incursion routes. Multiple disciplines globally continue to monitor the situation in Antarctica to see whether fears of ecological disaster in the region will be realised.MethodsSample collectionAll samples were collected from carcasses found dead on the islands with the permissions of the Falkland Islands government and the government of South Georgia through collaboration with the British Antarctic survey. Sampling was only conducted where safe to do so and to minimize potential pathogen spread by fomite transfer to healthy animals. Data was collected by staff on the ground to define location, species and approximate age.Virological detectionOn the Falkland Islands, initial diagnostic assessment of samples was undertaken at the KEMH Pathology and Food, Water & Environmental Laboratory utilising the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) and the Oasig OneStep RT-qPCR kit for H5N1 (Genesig). A preliminary diagnosis was made of avian influenza H5N1 infection. Following reports of increasing mortalities and the observation of disease consistent with HPAIV infection in avian and mammalian species in South Georgia, oropharyngeal (OP) and cloacal (C) swabs collected from birds were submitted to the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA)-Weybridge for laboratory virological investigation. Total nucleic acid was extracted from all samples45 for testing by a suite of three AIV real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assays consisting of the Matrix (M)-gene assay for generic influenza A virus detection47,48, an assay for specific detection of HPAIV H5 clade 2.3.4.4b45, and an N1-specific rRT-PCR to confirm the neuraminidase type46. All primers and probes used in these assays can be found in Supplementary Table 6A positive result was denoted in each case by a Cq value ≤ 36.0. The samples were also screened for avian paramyxovirus type 1 (APMV-1) by an rRT–PCR assay targeting the large polymerase (L) gene74 where a positive result was denoted by a Cq value ≤ 37.0. All amplifications were carried out in an AriaMx qPCR System (Agilent, United Kingdom). The OP swabs, C swabs or brain material were used for virus isolation in 9- to 11-day-old specific pathogen-free (SPF) embryonated fowls’ eggs (EFEs) according to the internationally recognised methods75.Whole-genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysisWherever possible, sequence generation was undertaken on original clinical material. However, material derived following successful virus isolation in eggs was also utilised for sequence generation. For whole-genome sequence analysis, the extracted vRNA was converted to double-stranded cDNA and amplified using a one-step RT-PCR using SuperScript III One-Step RT-PCR kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) as previously described76,77. The primers used can be found in Supplementary Table 6. PCR products were purified with Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coultrer) prior to sequencing library preparation using the Native Barcoding Kit (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) and sequenced using a GridION Mk1 (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Assembly of the influenza A viral genomes was performed using a custom in-house pipeline as described previously8 but adapted for nanopore sequence reads. All influenza sequences generated and used in this study are available through the GISAID EpiFlu Database (https://www.gisaid.org). All H5N1 HPAIV clade 2.3.4.4b sequences available in the EpiFlu database between 1st September 2020 and 22nd January 2024 were downloaded to create a sequence dataset. As North America and Europe were over-represented in this dataset, these were sub-sampled to maintain representative sequences using PARNAS78. The remaining dataset was separated by segment and aligned using Mafft v7.52079, and manually trimmed to the open-reading frame using Aliview version 1.2680 The trimmed alignments were then used to a infer maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree using IQ-Tree version 2.2.381 along with ModelFinder were downloaded to create a sequence dataset. As North America and Europe were over-represented in this dataset, these were sub-sampled to maintain representative sequences using PARNAS78. The remaining dataset was separated by segment and aligned using Mafft v7.52079, and manually trimmed to the open-reading frame using Aliview version 1.2680. The trimmed alignments were then used to a infer maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree using IQ-Tree version 2.2.381 along with ModelFinder8 and 1000 ultrafast bootstraps82. For the time-resolved phylogenetic analysis, all HA sequences available from South America, and representatives from North America were combined with the sequences from South Georgia and the Falkland Islands and used to infer phylogeny using BEAST version 1.10.483 with the BEAGLE library84. The Shapiro-Rambaut-Drummond-2006 (SRD06)85 nucleotide substitution model was implemented with a four-category gamma distribution model of site-specific rate variation and separate partitions for83 with the BEAGLE library83,84. The Shapiro-Rambaut-Drummond-2006 (SRD06)85 nucleotide substitution model was implemented with a four-category gamma distribution model of site-specific rate variation and separate partitions for codon positions 1 plus 2 versus position 3 with the Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano (HKY) HKY substitution models on each with a strict clock and a coalescent GMRF Bayesian skyride tree prior. Three independent Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) runs were performed and combined using the Log Combiner tool in the BEAST package. Each chain consisted of 200,000,000 steps and was sampled every 20,000 steps, and the first 10% of samples were discarded as the burn-in. Discrete geographical transition events were reconstructed using a symmetric continuous-time Markov Chain model with an incorporated Bayesian stochastic search variable selection (BSSVS) to determine which transition rates sufficiently summarize connectivity86. SpreaD3 was used to determine the rates of transmission using a Bayes factor (BF) test. The BF represents the ratio of two competing statistical models, represented by their marginal likelihood, and, in this case, was used to determine the likelihood of transmission between geographical locations. The support of the BF for transmission was interpreted as described previously87). BF and representative transitions related to South Georgia and the Falkland Islands were visualised on maps in R (v4.3.2) using the packages GGPlot288, rnaturalearth89, rnaturalearth data and sf90. Nucleotide identity between sequences was determined as described previously82. Sequences were genotyped according to the USDA schema, using the GenoFLU tool (https://github.com/USDA-VS/GenoFLU)49.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.

It may also be spread through contact with contaminated surfaces. There are many ways to prevent getting sick with the flu.Share on PinterestBrothers91/Getty ImagesInfluenza viruses cause a respiratory illness that you may know more commonly as “the flu.” In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that there were 35 to 65 million flu illnesses during the 2023 to 2024 flu season.The flu is contagious, meaning that it can spread from person to person. But how is it spread? Is it airborne, or is it spread by other means, such as by droplets or contact? Keep reading below as we explore what to know about how influenza spreads.Is influenza airborne, or does it spread by droplets or contact?So how exactly is influenza spread? Is it airborne, spread by droplets, or through contact? Why not all three?Let’s explore what we know about each type of transmission.Respiratory dropletsAccording to the CDC, most experts believe that influenza viruses are mainly spread by respiratory droplets.Respiratory droplets are made when you sneeze, cough, or talk. If respiratory droplets containing influenza virus come into contact with your mucus membranes, such as those in your nose or mouth, you can get sick.Research suggests that respiratory droplets are on the larger side, typically greater than 5 micrometers (µm) in size. Due to this, they don’t get very far and typically travel less than 6 feet before they fall out of the air the CDC reports.That means you have to be pretty close to someone to contract the virus from them. However, respiratory droplets can fall onto various objects and surfaces, which leads us to our next method.ContactWhen respiratory droplets fall out of the air, they can land on nearby surfaces. Depending on the conditions, influenza virus can still be infectious for many hours.For example, the virus can survive on hard, non-porous surfaces for 24 to 48 hours.You can contract the virus if you touch a contaminated surface and then touch your nose or mouth.Airborne transmissionWhen we talk about airborne transmission, we’re generally referring to aerosolized particles containing influenza virus that are less than 5 µm in size. These types of particles can be made simply by breathing.Unlike respiratory droplets (made when coughing or sneezing), which tend to land in the nose and throat, airborne particles can travel deeper into your respiratory tract. Because they are smaller, they can also remain suspended in the air for longer.The CDC notes that airborne transmission of influenza virus can occur when you’re in the vicinity of someone with the virus.Indeed, a 2020 study notes that previous research has found that 42% to 63% of particles containing influenza virus are of this small, respirable size.Further, researchers conducting a small 2018 study involving people with confirmed influenza and symptomatic were able to recover infectious virus from fine aerosols collected from breathing samples.Overall, the exact contribution of the airborne route of influenza transmission remains unclear. While an older 2013 study estimated that the airborne route may account for half of all influenza transmission events, more research is needed.Does air filtration help to prevent the spread of influenza?Yes. Improving ventilation indoors, such as through air filtration, can help prevent the spread of respiratory viruses like influenza.The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) notes that to be effective at removing viruses from the air, an air cleaner must be able to remove very small airborne particles, which it defines as those between 0.1 to 1 µm in size.They recommend checking the product information provided by the manufacturer to verify that an air cleaner can remove particles of this size.While air filtration can lower levels of virus in the air, it isn’t a substitute for other preventive measures, such as avoiding contact with people who are sick, handwashing frequently, and cleaning high-touch surfaces.How long does influenza stay in the air? The amount of time that influenza stays in the air can depend on the size of the particles that it’s in.For example, respiratory droplets between the sizes of 5 and 100 µm can remain in the air for about 5 minutes before dropping onto nearby surfaces.Aerosolized, or airborne, particles can stay in the air for longer. This is particularly true if there’s poor airflow or ventilation.One 2015 study involved aerosolizing a laboratory strain of influenza and sampling the air. It found that after 60 to 90 minutes, levels of infectious virus in the air were still enough to cause an infection.Aside from particle size, there are several other factors that can affect how long the influenza virus is infectious in the air or on surfaces. These include:Temperature: The influenza virus is more stable at lower temperatures.Humidity: Influenza virus is generally more likely to spread at lower humidity levels.UV radiation: Exposure to UV radiation, such as from sunlight, can inactivate influenza viruses.Does winter weather cause influenza? Yes and no. While the season doesn’t directly cause an influenza infection, some winter climates can cause the influenza virus to spread more easily. In many places the winter climate is colder and dryer, which can help the virus survive longer in the air and on surfaces. In addition, you’re more likely to spend time in crowded indoor spaces with poor ventilation and less likely to be using sunscreen (although it’s still important to). This can create an ideal situation for influenza to spread across communities during the winter months. Do masks help prevent the spread of influenza?According to the CDC, wearing a mask is an additional method for preventing the spread of respiratory viruses like influenza.The protection goes both ways and can protect you and your community. If you currently have the flu, wearing a mask can help lower your risk of passing it to others. If you don’t have the flu, a mask can prevent you from breathing in particles containing the virus.A 2020 analysis of 21 studies found that masks had a protective effect against respiratory viruses, including influenza.The authors of the analysis do point out that other studies have found that masks didn’t have a significant effect on influenza transmission. However, these studies often did not account for mask type, fit, or whether they were used consistently and properly.If you choose to wear a mask to prevent the flu, wearing a mask that offers a higher level of protection, such as a KN95, and fits well can help ensure that you receive the most benefits.Does hand sanitizer help prevent the spread of influenza? Yes. Hand hygiene, including using hand sanitizer, can significantly protect against influenza. Hand sanitizer can be particularly beneficial when soap and water are not readily available.For example, one small 2019 study found that, compared to schools with no hand hygiene methods, those using hand sanitizer had a 53% lower incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza infections.However, it’s important to note that some research suggests hand sanitizer is less effective than handwashing when the influenza virus is found in mucus.These results align with the CDC guidance that handwashing with soap and water is the best way to remove germs from your hands.Hand sanitizer can be used if soap and water are not available. Just be sure to use one that contains at least 60% alcohol, according to the CDC.Takeaway Influenza virus can spread in many different ways. It can be transmitted through the air via respiratory droplets and airborne transmission. You can also contract the flu virus from contacting contaminated surfaces and then touching your nose or mouth.There are many ways to prevent the flu. Some of these prevention methods we’ve discussed in detail here include practicing good hand hygiene, using an air filtration system, or wearing a mask.Another great way to prevent contracting the flu virus is getting the seasonal flu vaccine. Receiving the flu vaccine each year can help prevent sickness and complications from the flu. If you do get sick, it can help reduce the length and severity of your illness.How we reviewed this article:SourcesHistoryHealthline has strict sourcing guidelines and relies on peer-reviewed studies, academic research institutions, and medical journals and associations.

Children younger than 5 years old—especially those younger than 2—and children of any age with certain chronic health conditions, are at higher risk of developing potentially serious flu-related complications. Parents can help children fight flu by getting themselves and their children vaccinated against flu each year. Parents help children fight flu Each year, flu places a large burden on the health and well-being of children and their families. Annual flu vaccination offers the best protection against flu and its potentially serious complications in children. Children younger than 5 years old—especially those younger than 2—and children of any age with certain chronic health conditions, like asthma and diabetes, are at higher risk of developing potentially serious flu complications. Because these groups of children are at higher risk, it is especially important that they get a seasonal flu vaccine to help prevent flu, and to reduce their risk of being hospitalized or dying from flu if they do get sick. Healthy children 5 years and older can also get very sick from flu, in addition to spreading flu to vulnerable family members like infants younger than 6 months and adults who are 65 years and older or people of any age who have certain chronic health conditions. It's important to vaccinate everyone 6 months and older against flu each year to help protect those most at risk. Caregivers of young children Children 6 months and older and their caregivers should get vaccinated against flu each year and there are other preventive actions that everyone can take to help stop the spread of flu. Keep Reading: Caregivers of Infants and Young Children Who's at risk Flu can be dangerous for children Flu illness is more dangerous than the common cold for children. Each year, millions of children get sick with seasonal flu; thousands of children are hospitalized, and some children die from flu. Children commonly need medical care because of flu, especially children younger than 5 years old. Complications from flu among children in this age group can include: Pneumonia: an illness where the lungs get infected and inflamed Dehydration: when a child's body loses too much water and salts, often because fluid losses are greater than from fluid intake) Worsening of long-term medical problems like heart disease or asthma Brain dysfunction such as encephalopathy Sinus problems and ear infections In rare cases, flu complications can lead to death. Flu seasons vary in severity; however, every year children are at risk. CDC estimates that from the 2010-2011 season to the 2022-2023 season (excluding 2020-2021), flu-related hospitalizations among children younger than 5 years old each flu season have ranged from 6,000 to 25,000 annually in the United States. During the 2023-2024 flu season, 70 percent of children 0 to 17 years old hospitalized with flu had at least one underlying health condition, such as asthma, neurologic disease, obesity, or cardiovascular disease. While relatively rare, some children die from flu each year. From the 2004-2005 season to the 2022-2023 season (excluding 2020-2021), flu-related deaths in children reported to CDC during regular flu seasons have ranged from 37 to 199 deaths. Importantly, among reported flu-related deaths in children, about 80% occurred in children who were not fully vaccinated. Also of note, even though each flu death in a child is supposed to be reported to CDC, it is likely that not all flu-related deaths in children are captured and that the actual number of deaths is higher. CDC has developed statistical models that account for the underreporting of flu-related deaths in children to estimate the actual number of deaths. During 2019-2020, for example, 199 flu-related deaths in children were reported to CDC, but statistical modeling suggests approximately 434 deaths may have occurred. Prevention In children, annual flu vaccination has been shown to: Reduce flu illnesses, doctor's visits for flu, and missed school days. Reduce the risk of flu-related hospitalization and death. Keep Reading: Benefits of the Flu VaccineTypes of flu vaccines for children CDC recommends annual flu vaccination for everyone 6 months and older with any licensed, age-appropriate flu vaccine. There are many vaccine options: Flu shots are given as an injection (with a needle) and are approved for use in people 6 months and older. (Indications vary by vaccine.) Nasal spray vaccine (also known as the live attenuated influenza vaccine or LAIV) is approved for people 2 through 49 years old. However, LAIV is not recommended for people who are pregnant or who have certain underlying medical conditions. Keep Reading: Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine [LAIV] (The Nasal Spray Flu Vaccine)When children should get a flu vaccine Children should be vaccinated every flu season for the best protection against flu. For most people who need only one dose of flu vaccine for the season, September and October are generally good times to be vaccinated. Ideally, everyone 6 months and older should be vaccinated by the end of October. Some children need two doses of flu vaccine. For those children, it is recommended to get the first dose as soon as vaccine is available—even if this is in July or August—because the second dose needs to be given at least four weeks after the first. Vaccination during July and August also can be considered for children who need only one dose. If your child is visiting a health care provider in July or August (for example, in the back-to-school context) and vaccine is available, they can be vaccinated early. Early vaccination can be considered for any person who is unable to return at a later time to be vaccinated. However, getting vaccinated later can still be protective, as long as influenza viruses are spreading—even into January or later. Since it takes about two weeks after vaccination for the body to develop antibodies against influenza virus infection, it is best to get vaccinated so they are protected before flu begins spreading in their community. Special vaccination instructions for children aged 6 months through 8 years old Some children 6 months to 8 years old need two doses of flu vaccine this season: Children in this age group getting vaccinated for the first time, Children who have only previously received one dose of flu vaccine, and Children whose flu vaccination history is unknown. For these children it is recommended they get the first dose as soon as vaccine is available, because the second dose needs to be given at least 4 weeks after the first. Your child's health care provider can tell you if your child needs two doses. Other preventive actions In addition to getting a flu vaccine, children and caregivers should take the same actions CDC recommends for everyone, including avoiding people who are sick, washing hands often, and covering coughs. This also can include taking steps for cleaner air and hygiene practices like cleaning frequently touched surfaces.

Cathy/Flickr cc The herd started showing clinical signs consistent with H5N1 on August 25, and the dairy owners worked with veterinarians and the CDFA to submit samples for state lab testing. The CDFA added that no human cases have been detected and that the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) is working with the CDFA to monitor people who were exposed to the sick cows.The CDFA said it and the CDFA have been preparing for possible outbreaks and that, earlier this summer, the CDPH supported the distribution of personal protective equipment to dairy farms, workers who handle raw milk, slaughterhouse workers, and those working on poultry farms.The USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) yesterday added the three herds to its list of confirmed H5N1 outbreaks in dairy cows, lifting the nation's total to 197 in 14 states. CDC: Overall teen vaccine uptake plateaus, but up-to-date HPV coverage drops News brief Mary Van Beusekom, MS Topics Childhood Vaccines Human Papillomavirus (HPV) wissanu01 / iStock A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) analysis finds that overall US teen vaccination uptake was similar in 2022 and 2023, with a decline in up-to-date human papillomavirus (HPV UTD) vaccination by age 13 among adolescents born in 2010 versus 2007.CDC investigators used the 2015 to 2023 iterations of the National Immunization Survey-Teen of 16,658 participants aged 13 to 17 years (born from January 2005 to December 2010) to estimate 2023 coverage, recent patterns by birth year, and trends by eligibility for the no-cost Vaccines for Children (VFC) program.The results were published in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.Expanding opportunities to vaccinateIn 2023, 89.0%, 88.4%, 76.8%, and 61.4% of 13- to 17-year-olds had received one or more doses of tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis (Tdap), quadrivalent (four-strain) meningococcal conjugate (MenACWY), HPV, and HPV UTD vaccines, respectively. From 2022 to 2023, receipt of the serogroup B meningococcal and hepatitis A vaccines rose 3.0 and 1.9 percentage points, respectively.Vaccinations can also be administered through school-based clinics, pharmacies, and back-to-school health events, which can provide expanded opportunities for adolescents to receive recommended vaccines.Receipt of at least one vaccine dose against Tdap, MenACWY, and HPV by age 13 among VFC-eligible teens born from 2008 to 2010 was comparable to that of those born in 2007. But the proportions of VFC-eligible and -ineligible adolescents current with HPV vaccination were 10.3 and 7.1 percentage points lower, respectively, among those born in 2010 than those born in 2007. Of teens born from 2003 to 2008, uptake of at least one dose of the Tdap and MenACWY vaccines by age 13 was lower among VFC-eligible than -ineligible adolescents, while coverage was similar for both groups born in 2009 and 2010."Health care providers should make strong recommendations for all routine vaccines and verify if adolescents, particularly those eligible for the VFC program, are up to date with all recommended vaccines," the authors wrote."Vaccinations can also be administered through school-based clinics, pharmacies, and back-to-school health events, which can provide expanded opportunities for adolescents to receive recommended vaccines," they added. FDA clears new Lyme disease test News brief Topics Lyme Disease Antimicrobial Stewardship Diagnostics company ID-Fish Technology announced today that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has cleared its new Lyme disease test.The iDart Lyme IgG ImmunoBlot Kit is a stand-alone test for detecting Lyme-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies that includes 31 Lyme antigen bands, more than any other Lyme test on the market. The company says the inclusion of 31 antigens will improve the sensitivity of Lyme disease diagnosis in suspected patients without sacrificing specificity. "The R&D team at ID-FISH has worked tirelessly on making sure that we deliver the most accurate test possible for the detection of Lyme disease," ID-Fish Technology Chief Scientific Officer Jyotsna Shah, PhD, said in a company press release. "We look forward to working with partners to get these tests to patients who need a correct diagnosis." Around 475,000 Americans annually are diagnosed with Lyme disease, which is caused by Borrelia burgdorferi, a type of bacteria carried by black-legged (deer) ticks.Faster antimicrobial susceptibility test also clearedIn other diagnostic news, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) announced last week that the FDA has cleared bioMerieux's new antimicrobial susceptibility test (AST) for gram-negative pathogens commonly associated with bloodstream infections (BSIs).The Vitek Reveal GN AST works with bioMerieux's Vitek Reveal AST System, which uses a metabolomic signature technology to produce phenotypic AST results from positive blood cultures within 5.5 to 6 hours—75% faster than traditional AST methods.Fast and accurate AST results for gram-negative BSIs are considered crucial for reducing inappropriate antibiotic use and improving patient outcomes.The test was developed by bioMerieux in partnership with BARDA. Polio vaccination well under way in Gaza News brief Stephanie Soucheray, MA Topics Polio Today marks the third day of a widespread polio vaccination campaign in Gaza, and the World Health Organization (WHO) said the campaign was ahead of targets, with roughly 25% of children under 10 in the war-torn region now vaccinated. According to Reuters, the mass campaign occurs during daily 8-hour pauses in fighting between Israel and Hamas militants in specific areas of Gaza. In total 161,000 children have been inoculated since September 1, exceeding the goal of 150,000. Another 340,000 children in southern Gaza will be inoculated at the end of this week, and the 10-day campaign will conclude in northern Gaza. By the end of the campaign, approximately 640,000 children under 10 years old will be vaccinated. Call for Israel, Hamas to respect humanitarian pauses The efforts to launch a mass vaccination campaign were made after a 10-month-old baby in Gaza was diagnosed as having polio at the end of August, the first case in the region in 25 years. Several other suspected cases have been reported, according to Doctors Without Border, and positive environmental samples have been collected in at least two districts in Gaza. Our teams are committed to making sure no child is missed, despite ongoing displacement."Day three of the campaign is ongoing and the majority of the remaining children in central Gaza should be vaccinated by the end of the day," said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, on X. "Our teams are committed to making sure no child is missed, despite ongoing displacement. We call on all parties to continue respecting the humanitarian pauses." Cambodia's recent H5N1 case involved novel reassortant News brief Lisa Schnirring Topics Avian Influenza (Bird Flu) The World Health Organization (WHO) yesterday shared more details from Cambodia about its latest fatal H5N1 avian flu case, including that it involves the older 2.3.2.1c clade but noting that the virus that infected the girl is a novel reassortant that include internal genes from the newer 2.3.4.4b clade. Leo Malsam / iStock Investigators found that poultry died in the girl's Prey Vent province village and that her family was given some of them to eat and that the girl was exposed to the chicken while preparing food. Her symptoms began on August 11, and, when her condition worsened, she was hospitalized about a week later in Phnom Penh and treated with oseltamivir (Tamiflu). She died on August 20.Sequencing of the patient's virus sample at the Pasteur Institute in Cambodia found that the hemagglutinin gene from the 2.3.2.1c clade that has been circulating in Cambodia and Southeast Asia since 2013. The internal genes, however, belonged to the newer 2.3.4.4b, which is circulating globally. "This novel reassortant influenza A(H5N1) virus has been detected in human cases reported in Cambodia since late 2023," the WHO said.Cambodian health officials have tracked and monitored the girl's contacts, and no related cases have been found. The country has reported an uptick in human H5N1 infections since 2023, reporting 6 cases last year and 10 this year, of which 2 were fatal.Reassortant circulating in poultry, found in earlier human casesIn April, animal health officials in Vietnam and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) warned of the new reassortant circulating in chickens and muscovy ducks. The scientists said the virus has been circulating in the Greater Mekong subregion since 2022. Also, they noted that the reassortant had been linked to recent human cases and that the development shows the adaptive capacity of the virus and the risk of new, potentially more virulent strains. Study finds no benefit from longer antibiotic treatment for multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas pneumonia News brief Chris Dall, MA Topics Antimicrobial Stewardship sudok1 / iStock A single-center study found that prolonging antibiotic treatment beyond 8 days did not improve outcomes in patients who had healthcare-acquired pneumonia caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa, researchers reported today in BMC Infectious Diseases.In the retrospective study, researchers at Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami compared outcomes in two groups of patients who had been treated for hospital-acquired/ventilator-associated pneumonia (HAP/VAP) caused by MDR P aeruginosa from 2017 through 2020. One group received 8 days or less of antibiotic therapy, which is roughly in line with the duration recommended by Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines (7 days), and the other group received more than 8 days' worth. The primary outcome was clinical success at the end of therapy, defined as resolution of signs and symptoms of infection and no need for additional antibiotic treatment. Secondary outcomes included 30-day and 90-day mortality and relapsed pneumonia within 30 days of index culture. Relapse is one of the concerns when treating HAP/VAP caused by MDR P aeruginosa with a short course of antibiotics, particularly in immunocompromised patients.No difference in clinical outcomesOf the 85 patients (median age, 65.5 years) who met the inclusion criteria, 30 (35.3%) received 8 days or less of antibiotics and 55 (64.7%) received more than 8 days. Most patients in both groups were in the intensive care unit. Compared with those who received 8 days or less of antibiotics, no difference was seen for clinical success in patients treated for more than 8 days (80.0% vs 65.5%; odds ratio [OR], 0.47; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.16 to 1.36). Similarly, no difference was found in 30-day and 90-day mortality among treatment groups, nor did patients who received shorter therapy have a higher relapse rate within 30 days of index culture."This result favors the approach of treating patients with MDR P. aeruginosa HAP/VAP for ≤8 days, instead of a longer duration, to prevent the development of resistance and adverse drug events," the study authors wrote.

AP Photo Email X (Twitter) Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger Nineteen-year-old U.S. Army Pvt. David Lewis set out from Fort Dix on a 50-mile hike with his unit on Feb. 5, 1976. On that bitter cold day, he collapsed and died. Autopsy specimens unexpectedly tested positive for an H1N1 swine influenza virus. Virus disease surveillance at Fort Dix found another 13 cases among recruits who had been hospitalized for respiratory illness. Additional serum antibody testing revealed that over 200 recruits had been infected but not hospitalized with the novel swine H1N1 strain. Officials worried about a repeat of something like the 1918 flu pandemic, which took hold in soldiers and spread globally. PhotoQuest/Getty Images Alarm bells instantly went off within the epidemiology community: Could Pvt. Lewis’ death from an H1N1 swine flu be a harbinger of another global pandemic like the terrible 1918 H1N1 swine flu pandemic that killed an estimated 50 million people worldwide? The U.S. government acted quickly. On March 24, 1976, President Gerald Ford announced a plan to “inoculate every man, woman, and child in the United States.” On Oct. 1, 1976, the mass immunization campaign began. Meanwhile, the initial small outbreak at Fort Dix had rapidly fizzled, with no new cases on the base after February. As Army Col. Frank Top, who headed the Fort Dix virus investigation, later told me, “We had shown pretty clearly that (the virus) didn’t go anywhere but Fort Dix … it disappeared.” Nonetheless, concerned by that outbreak and witnessing the massive crash vaccine program in the U.S., biomedical scientists worldwide began H1N1 swine influenza vaccine research and development programs in their own countries. Going into the 1976-77 winter season, the world waited – and prepared – for an H1N1 swine influenza pandemic that never came. By September 1976, New York State Health Department workers were unloading cartons of swine flu vaccine for distribution. AP Photo/Jim McKnight But that wasn’t the end of the story. As an experienced infectious disease epidemiologist, I make the case that there were unintended consequences of those seemingly prudent but ultimately unnecessary preparations. What was odd about H1N1 Russian flu pandemic In an epidemiological twist, a new pandemic influenza virus did emerge, but it was not the anticipated H1N1 swine virus. In November 1977, health officials in Russia reported that a human – not swine – H1N1 influenza strain had been detected in Moscow. By month’s end, it was reported across the entire USSR and soon throughout the world. Compared with other influenzas, this pandemic was peculiar. First, the mortality rate was low, about a third that of most influenza strains. Second, only those younger than 26 were regularly attacked. And finally, unlike other newly emerged pandemic influenza viruses in the past, it failed to displace the existing prevalent H3N2 subtype that was that year’s seasonal flu. Instead, the two flu strains – the new H1N1 and the long-standing H3N2 – circulated side by side. Here the story takes yet another turn. Microbiologist Peter Palese applied what was then a novel technique called RNA oligonucleotide mapping to study the genetic makeup of the new H1N1 Russian flu virus. He and his colleagues grew the virus in the lab, then used RNA-cutting enzymes to chop the viral genome into hundreds of pieces. By spreading the chopped RNA in two dimensions based on size and electrical charge, the RNA fragments created a unique fingerprint-like map of spots. Researchers were surprised to see the ‘genetic fingerprint’ for the 1977 H1N1 Russian flu strain closely matched that of an extinct influenza virus. Peter Palese Much to Palese’s surprise, when they compared the spot pattern of the 1977 H1N1 Russian flu with a variety of other influenza viruses, this “new” virus was essentially identical to older human influenza H1N1 strains that had gone extinct in the early 1950s. So, the 1977 Russian flu virus was actually a strain that had disappeared from the planet a quarter century early, then was somehow resurrected back into circulation. This explained why it attacked only younger people – older people had already been infected and become immune when the virus circulated decades ago in its earlier incarnation. But how did the older strain come back from extinction? Though called the Russian flu, the virus appears to have been circulating elsewhere before being identified in the Soviet population. Gilbert UZAN/Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images Refining the timeline of a resurrected virus Despite its name, the Russian flu probably didn’t really start in Russia. The first published reports of the virus were from Russia, but subsequent reports from China provided evidence that it had first been detected months earlier, in May and June of 1977, in the Chinese port city of Tientsin. In 2010, scientists used detailed genetic studies of several samples of the 1977 virus to pinpoint the date of their earliest common ancestor. This “molecular clock” data suggested the virus initially infected people a full year earlier, in April or May of 1976. So, the best evidence is that the 1977 Russian flu actually emerged – or more properly “re-emerged” – in or near Tientsin, China, in the spring of 1976. A frozen lab virus Was it simply a coincidence that within months of Pvt. Lewis’ death from H1N1 swine flu, a heretofore extinct H1N1 influenza strain suddenly reentered the human population? Influenza virologists around the world had for years been using freezers to store influenza virus strains, including some that had gone extinct in the wild. Fears of a new H1N1 swine flu pandemic in 1976 in the United States had prompted a worldwide surge in research on H1N1 viruses and vaccines. An accidental release of one of these stored viruses was certainly possible in any of the countries where H1N1 research was taking place, including China, Russia, the U.S., the U.K. and probably others. Years after the reemergence, Palese, the microbiologist, reflected on personal conversations he had at the time with Chi-Ming Chu, the leading Chinese expert on influenza. Palese wrote in 2004 that “the introduction of the 1977 H1N1 virus is now thought to be the result of vaccine trials in the Far East involving the challenge of several thousand military recruits with live H1N1 virus.” Although exactly how such an accidental release may have occurred during a vaccine trial is unknown, there are two leading possibilities. First, scientists could have used the resurrected H1N1 virus as their starting material for development of a live, attenuated H1N1 vaccine. If the virus in the vaccine wasn’t adequately weakened, it could have become transmissible person to person. Another possibility is that researchers used the live, resurrected virus to test the immunity provided by conventional H1N1 vaccines, and it accidentally escaped from the research setting. Whatever the specific mechanism of the release, the combination of the detailed location and timing of the pandemic’s origins and the stature of Chu and Palese as highly credible sources combine to make a strong case for an accidental release in China as the source of the Russian flu pandemic virus. The H1N1 influenza virus identified at Fort Dix wasn’t the one that ended up causing a pandemic. CDC/Dr. E. Palmer, R.E. Bates, 1976 via Getty Images A sobering history lesson The resurrection of an extinct but dangerous human-adapted H1N1 virus came about as the world was scrambling to prevent what was perceived to be the imminent emergence of a swine H1N1 influenza pandemic. People were so concerned about the possibility of a new pandemic that they inadvertently caused one. It was a self-fulfilling-prophecy pandemic. I have no intent to lay blame here; indeed, my main point is that in the epidemiological fog of the moment in 1976, with anxiety mounting worldwide about a looming pandemic, a research unit in any country could have accidentally released the resurrected virus that came to be called the Russian flu. In the global rush to head off a possible new pandemic of H1N1 swine flu from Fort Dix through research and vaccination, accidents could have happened anywhere. Of course, biocontainment facilities and policies have improved dramatically over the past half-century. But at the same time, there has been an equally dramatic proliferation of high-containment labs around the world. Across the globe, researchers work on dangerous pathogens in labs that are part of biocontainment facilities. AP Photo/Michael Probst Overreaction. Unintended consequences. Making matters worse. Self-fulfilling prophecy. There is a rich variety of terms to describe how the best intentions can go awry. Still reeling from COVID-19, the world now faces new threats from cross-species jumps of avian flu viruses, mpox viruses and others. It’s critical that we be quick to respond to these emerging threats to prevent yet another global disease conflagration. Quick, but not too quick, history suggests.

This particular strain of influenza has recently been identified in dairy cattle and is now present in herds in 18 states. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported 13 cases of avian flu in humans since April 2024. “We will be developing two investigational mRNA vaccines targeting avian influenza, one is a more traditional vaccine, and one is a computationally-designed vaccine,” said Thomas Denny, chief operating officer of the Duke Human Vaccine Institute (DHVI). The mRNA approach is the same kind of vaccine used against COVID. The award from NIAID, which is a part of the National Institutes of Health, is part of a contract called the Collaborative Influenza Vaccine Innovation Centers (CIVICs), which NIAID set up to develop new influenza vaccines that induce long-lasting immunity and protect against more variants of the virus. DHVI is unusual in having a Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) program that enables it to rapidly produce experimental new vaccines in sufficient quality and quantity to use in clinical trials. The first investigational vaccine DHVI is being asked to make is more of a traditional design. “The second mRNA vaccine that we’re making is what we call more of a central immunogen designed vaccine. Think of this as more of a central immunogen vaccine designed around the evolution of the virus,” Denny said. “With this type of vaccine design the hope is that it will elicit a broad spectrum of antibodies against avian flu and reduce the need to adjust the vaccine periodically should we see new strains of avian flu develop. “This is in contrast to what currently occurs for COVID vaccines as new strains develop and we need to frequently update the vaccine.” If the virus that’s circulating now and has infected those 13 people changes a year from now, this vaccine could still provide coverage. The hope is also that a broadly effective vaccine would reduce or eliminate the need of boosting year after year as the type of flu changes. DHVI employs a team science approach and collaborated with the research team at Erasmus University Medical Center in the Netherlands who discovered the influenza immunogen. “We expect to complete manufacturing this fall, with the goal of having vaccines ready for Phase 1 clinical trials to begin in early 2025,” Denny said.

The first case of bird flu without a known exposure to a sick animal was announced Friday by the CDC. John Bazemore/AP CNN — A person in Missouri is the United States’ first case of H5 avian influenza without a known exposure to a sick animal, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday. “This is the 14th human case of H5 reported in the United States during 2024 and the first case of H5 without a known occupational exposure to sick or infected animals,” the CDC said in a statement. It’s also the first H5 case detected through the country’s national flu surveillance system rather than targeted surveillance of the ongoing bird flu outbreak in animals.

The case is under investigation by the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services. The person had underlying medical conditions and was hospitalized on August 22. The person tested positive for influenza A, was treated with influenza antiviral medications and is now recovered and at home, according to MDHSS. A sample from the patient was sent to the CDC, which confirmed that the case was a type of bird flu. Flu viruses are classified based on two proteins that sit on the surface of the virus an H, or hemagglutinin, protein, and an N, or neuraminidase, protein. A spokesperson for the CDC said the agency had confirmed the flu type is H5, but has not yet determined the N type. They are working on isolating the virus and reading its genetic sequence. Scientists at the CDC hope to have more information on the genetics of the virus in the coming days, the spokesperson said. Knowing the genetic sequence will tell researchers how closely the virus that infected this patient may be related to the viruses that currently causing outbreaks in chickens, and cows and other mammals in the US. There are no cases of bird flu among cattle in Missouri, but there have been outbreaks of the virus among poultry in the state. The CDC’s risk assessment of H5N1 for the general public remains low, the agency said. CNN’s Brenda Goodman contributed to this report.

Antiviral drugs are most effective when taken early (within two days of symptoms starting). Early treatment with antiviral drugs is especially important for children who are at higher risk for flu complications. Your child's health care provider can help decide if your child should take flu antiviral drugs. Background While getting an influenza (flu) vaccine each year is recommended by CDC as the first and most important action in protecting against flu, there also are drugs that can treat flu illness. These "flu antiviral drugs" are an important treatment option for children with suspected or confirmed flu. Flu antivirals Antiviral drugs for children come in the form of pills, liquid, inhaled powder, or intravenous (IV) solution. They fight flu by keeping influenza viruses from reproducing in the body. Antiviral drugs must be prescribed by a health care provider — they are not available over the counter. For treatment, flu antiviral drugs should ideally be started within two days after becoming sick, but children can still benefit when antiviral treatment is started two or more days after becoming sick. Antiviral drugs are especially important for children who are at increased risk for flu complications or who are hospitalized. If a child is sick with flu, antiviral drugs offer a safe and effective treatment option. Flu antiviral drugs only work against influenza viruses — they will not help against other viruses that may cause illness symptoms similar to flu. Benefits from antiviral treatment of influenza Flu antiviral drugs can make flu symptoms milder and can shorten duration of illness. Antiviral drugs work best if started soon after getting sick (within two days of symptoms starting). Early treatment of flu with antiviral drugs also has been shown to reduce the incidence of ear infections and the need for antibiotic treatment in children between 1 and 12 years old. Treatment with antiviral drugs also may reduce more serious flu-related complications like pneumonia and hospitalization. Studies in both adults and children show that treatment of hospitalized patients can be beneficial in preventing respiratory failure and death. Keep Reading: Signs and Symptoms of FluCDC and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommend antiviral drugs to treat confirmed or suspected flu in children with severe, complicated, or progressive illness, or who are hospitalized with confirmed or suspected flu, as early as possible. Prompt initiation of antiviral treatment also is recommended for children who have confirmed or suspected flu and who are at increased risk of serious flu complications. Children at increased risk of flu-related complications include children younger than 5 years old (especially those younger than 2 years old) and children of any age with certain chronic health conditions like asthma, diabetes, or heart or lung disease. See Also: AAP's Red Book Online Influenza Resource PageAntiviral drugs approved for use in children There are four flu antiviral drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the United States which are recommended by CDC for use in children this flu season: Oseltamivir (available as a generic version or under the trade name Tamiflu®) is approved for treatment of flu in children 14 days old and older. Oral oseltamivir comes in the form of pills and liquid. Although not part of the FDA-approved indications, use of oral oseltamivir for treatment of flu in infants younger than 14 days old, and for chemoprophylaxis in infants 3 months to 1 year, is recommended by the CDC and the American Academy of Pediatrics. If a child is younger than 3 months old, use of oseltamivir for chemoprophylaxis is not recommended unless the situation is judged critical due to limited data in this age group. Zanamivir (trade name Relenza®) is approved for treatment of flu in children 7 years and older. It is not recommended for use in children with underlying respiratory disease, including those with asthma and other chronic lung diseases. Inhaled zanamivir is given via a special inhaler (Diskhaler®). Peramivir (trade name Rapivab®) is given intravenously and recommended for use in children 6 months and older. Baloxavir (trade name Xofluza®) is a pill that is given as a single dose by mouth and is approved for early treatment of flu in children 5 years to younger than 12 years who do not have any chronic medical conditions, and for all children 12 years and older. Mixing oseltamivir capsules‎ If your child's provider prescribes oseltamivir capsules for your child and your child cannot swallow capsules, the prescribed capsules may be opened, mixed with a thick sweetened liquid, and given that way. Opening and Mixing Oseltamivir Capsules with Liquids if Child Cannot Swallow Capsules Side effects of antiviral drugs Side effects vary for each medication. The most common side effects for oseltamivir are nausea and vomiting. Zanamivir can cause difficulty breathing in people with underlying lung disease and peramivir can cause diarrhea. Other less common side effects also have been reported. Your health care provider can give you more information about these drugs or you can check the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website for specific information about antiviral drugs, including the manufacturer's package insert. See Also: Food and Drug Administration (FDA) If your child gets sick with flu Your child's health care provider can help decide whether your child should take antiviral drugs if they become sick with flu this season. Flu signs and symptoms include fever, headache, extreme tiredness, dry cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose and muscle aches. It's important to note that some children with flu will not have a fever.

Based on the National Influenza Surveillance Network (NISN), the Bv 72 strains isolated during 2019–2022 were selected by spatio-temporal sampling, then were sequenced. Using the Compare Means, Correlate and Cluster, the outbreak data were analyzed, including the single nucleotide variant (SNV), amino acid (AA), epitope, evolutionary rate (ER), Shannon entropy value (SV), charged amino acid and outbreak. With the emergence of COVID-19, the non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) made Less distant transmission and only Bv outbreak. The 2021–2022 strains in the HA genes were located in the same subset, but were distinct from the 2019–2020 strains (P < 0.001). The codon G → A transition in nucleotide was in the highest ratio but the transversion of C → A and T → A made the most significant contribution to the outbreaks, while the increase in amino acid mutations characterized by polar, acidic and basic signatures played a key role in the Bv epidemic in 2021–2022. Both ER and SV were positively correlated in HA genes (R = 0.690) and NA genes (R = 0.711), respectively, however, the number of mutations in the HA genes was 1.59 times higher than that of the NA gene (2.15/1.36) from the beginning of 2020 to 2022. The positively selective sites 174, 199, 214 and 563 in HA genes and the sites 73 and 384 in NA genes were evolutionarily selected in the 2021–2022 influenza outbreaks. Overall, the prevalent factors related to 2021–2022 influenza outbreaks included epidemic timing, Tv, Ts, Tv/Ts, P137 (B → P), P148 (B → P), P199 (P → A), P212 (P → A), P214 (H → P) and P563 (B → P). The preference of amino acid mutations for charge/pH could influence the epidemic/outbreak trends of infectious diseases. Here was a good model of the evolution of infectious disease pathogens. This study, on account of further exploration of virology, genetics, bioinformatics and outbreak information, might facilitate further understanding of their deep interaction mechanisms in the spread of infectious diseases.

According to the antigenic characteristics, human influenza viruses are divided into four types: A, B, C and D, of which influenza A virus gene and antigen are prone to mutation, often leading to an epidemic or pandemic; influenza B virus gene is relatively small variation, usually causing local outbreaks1,2. In recent years, influenza type B has attracted global attention, as according to a report summarized with 47 studies, hospitalization in type B for 6.7d was longer than that in type A for 6.5d, and the clinical fatality rate (CFR) of people aged 50 years could reach to 2.5% (95%CI 0.7% ~ 7.6%, P < 0.001)3.Influenza viruses are characterized by both surface glycoproteins, including hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). The HA and NA mutations based on amino acid sequences were the basis of antigenic shift and drift4. Due to their lack of polymerase proofreading activity, influenza virus genes are frequently mutated without genetic correction, resulting in 1–2% annual divergence of influenza strains5. Genetic evolution might be demonstrated by genome structure mutations and nucleotide substitutions, while the mutations of genome structure include insertions/deletions (indels) and inversions and the nucleotide (Nt) substitutions involving single nucleotide variant (SNV) includes both transition (Ts) and transversion (Tv)6. Either purine (pyrimidine) ↔ purine (pyrimidine) transitions or pyrimidine ↔ purine transversions in SNV have been explored in their impact on nucleotide composition evolution in human and animal7. A longstanding approach for analyzing amino acid (AA) and protein is to compare rates of nonsynonymous (dN) and synonymous (dS) substitutions at each site, where these dN/dS ratios might be calculated by counting mutations or using phylogenetic substitution models8.The epidemic of influenza arises from genetic and antigenic mutations, where the epitopes containing some key amino acids play a crucial role in antigenicity9. The D614G substitution in SARS-CoV-2 enhances the pathogenic infectivity, of which both (Aspartic/Glutamic) belong to the acidic amino acids10. Furthermore, the conserved protective epitopes of hemagglutinin (HA) are essential to the design of a universal influenza vaccine and new targeted therapeutic agents, especially on small proteins and peptides11. Thus, the amino acids that constitute the antigen domain, on account of their molecular structure, hydrophilicity and charged properties, might have different weights on their antigenicity.Globally, there were three seasonal influenza strains (H3N2/H1N1/B) cocirculating across continents, but the non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) since the spring of 2020 resulted in only influenza B Victoria lineage (Bv) dominated from March 2020 till March 2021 in China12. NPIs have been implemented worldwide, including travel restrictions, face masks, social distancing, public education on prevention measures, and school closures13. Due to the influence of NPI, influenza outbreaks and epidemic in southern China have become an investigation model for infectious disease transmission in an ideal closed-loop environment. Here, based on Bv epidemic information and some genetic sequence, we analyzed the data using the multiple statistical approaches based on spatio-temporal connectivity, to evaluate Ts/Tv substitutions, charged amino acid effects and variable-related outbreaks and to further explore the internal connections of genetic evolution with outbreaks.MethodsSurveillance and gene sequenceThis study was based on the National Influenza Surveillance Network (NISN, https://10.249.6.18:8881/cdc/)12. Influenza surveillance is performed on basis of the National Influenza Surveillance Program (2017 edition)14. The definition of influenza-like illness (ILI) case is a case had body temperature ≥ 38 °C, accompanied with either cough or sore throat, but a lack of molecular detection; Influenza case is an ILI tested positive for nucleic acid of influenza virus. An influenza outbreak is defined as the occurrence of 10 or more cases of ILI in the same school, childcare institution, or other collective unit within a week.A total of 72 Guangdong (GD) strains were selected by spatio-temporal sampling from March 2019 to April 2022, including 16, 9, 34 and 13 strains per year (no strains isolated during Apr-Dec 2020). Global strains were downloaded from GenBank (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/) or GISAID (https://platform.epicov.org/epi3/frontend), including four vaccine strains (VSs) recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) and five regional strains with characteristics. As for regional distribution, a total of 72 strains (42 from outbreaks and 30 from hospital sentinels) included in Chaozhou (5), Dongguan (2), Foshan (1), Guangzhou (5), Heyuan (4), Huizhou (5), Jiangmen (3), Maomin (6), Meizhou (3), Qingyuan (8), Shantou (2), Shanwei (2), Shaoguan (10), Shenzhen (6), Yunfu (2), Zhanjiang (4), Zhongshan (2) and Zhuhai (2) (Supplementary Table S1a,b). A set of primers of Bv strains was designed and synthesized, on account of the Bv strains isolated during 2016–2018 (Supplementary Table S2). The 72 strains in this study were extracted, amplified, and sequenced15, and then the genetic fragments were merged [GenBank accession PP989545-PP989616 (HA) and PQ037033-PQ037104 (NA)].Genetic data processingNucleotideThe nucleotide (Nt) sequences based on open reading frame (ORF) are aligned by Clustal W while both phylogenetic trees of HA and NA genes (Figure S1) are established with Neighbor-Joining (NJ) in MEGA 11.0.1316. Nucleotide variation rates are calculated across stages and years using a single VS sequence benchmark, of which the differences were statistically compared using One-Way ANOVA. Grounded in the neutral theory of molecular evolution, the binary coalescent tree is the dual backward representation of the continuous-forward-time diffusion model of genetic drift. In species phylogeny and epidemiology, the tree structure is often used to compare different models of evolution or to fit model parameters17. Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA) is a widely used method which employs variance to study the hierarchical genetic structure of populations, where the nucleotide diversity (D) is calculated as the mean pairwise genetic distance obtained17, while the statistical algorithm for genetic variability is as follows: D = [π − S/(0.5 − log(fmin))]/S. Here the pairwise dN/dS estimates were calculated for the coding regions19.Based on the SNV, the sequenced data are clustered into 12 substitutions (4 × 3), pooling both transition G(C) ↔ A(T) or transversion G(C) ↔ C/T (A/G). Here the substitution ratio is calculated: Ri = Mi/Ni, where R is ratio, subscript i is the specific nucleotide and both M and N are the mutation Nt numbers per specific purine or pyrimidine20.The strains were sampled from both the outbreak (Ob) and the hospital sentinel (HS), while the strain sampling dates were classified into the Stage 1 (S1, 2019 → February 2020) and the Stage 2 (S2, March 2020 → Apr 2022), which depended on the subsequent statistical calculation (Cluster).Amino acidThe amino acid (AA) sequences are aligned by Clustal W as well. The AA mutations are analyzed, then classified into four groups, the hydrophobic (H), polar (P), acidic (A) and basic (B) amino acids on account of their charged features (Supplementary Table S3). The Shannon entropy values per AA site are then calculated18. The equation in Shannon Entropy formulation is as follows, where L is a list of all possible amino acids in all the sequences and Pk(i) is the probability of finding the kth amino acid at that position19.$$ H\left( i \right) \, = - \sum\limits_{k \in L} {{P_k}(i) \times {{\log }_2}{P_k}(i)} $$Evolutionary and cluster analysisThe rate of molecular evolution is measured by the number of Nt sequence mutations per unit time. Cumulative mutations across the whole gene region can effectively be used to estimate positive selection (or selective pressure) by calculating substitution ratio of dN/dS (ω)21. Sequence data including Nt and AA are analyzed using the χ2 Test in categorical data and using the One-Way ANOVA in compare means. With the TwoStep and Hierarchical Clusters, the relationship among the variables related to influenza genetic and outbreak are analyzed22. Based on the Schwarz’s Bayesian Criterion (BIC), the Cluster model is as follows: − 2Lm + m × lnn, here with the maximized log-likelihood (Lm) and the sample size (n), which fitted for the minimum value.Statistical evaluationThe data are processed using WPS tabulation and SPSS 23.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL.), where the mean value in statistics description is performed using Mean ± SD (normal distribution) or Median (P25, P75) (skew distribution)17.The compare means and the nonparametric test are statistically significant relying on the P value < 0.05 in two sides, while the evolutionary selection is on the P value < 0.10. The correlation is significant based on the R value > 0.50. The statistical logic and processes of the other approaches are interpreted as needed.ResultsNucleotide homology and evolutionMost of the HA and NA sequences in the ORF have 1749 bp and 1401 bp, respectively, but by the genetic alignment, the HA ORF in Bri/60/08 (2008 VS) being 1758 bp was deleted of Nt529-537 (aaaaacgac) in all HA genes in the 2019–2022 strains in this study except for the HA gene in GD/1557/19 (1758 bp).The homologies of HA and NA genes in GD strains were compared with those of four VSs (Table 1). It showed as follows, (1) The highest identities in HA gene occurred in 2020 (99.80 ± 0.07, 2019 VS) and in 2022 (99.23 ± 0.22, 2021 VS) (P < 0.001), respectively; (2) On account of HA genes of the 2021 VS, the HA genes of the GD strains during 2021–2022 were classified in the subset 2, which was different from those of other three VSs; (3) The highest identity in NA genes with the 2021 VS was in 2021 (98.57 ± 0.15) than in 2022 (98.43 ± 0.13) (P = 0.012), which indicated that the 2022 strains in both HA and NA genes further evolved than the 2021 VS.Table 1 Homologies of HA/NA genes (ORF) between GD strains and vaccine strains (VSs).Full size tableBoth trees of HA and NA genes of 72 influenza Bv strains isolated in Guangdong (Supplementary Fig. S1) have the following characteristics, (1) The HA genes from 2019 to 2020 were closer to the 2019 VS (Was/2/19), and those in 2021–2022 were identical to that in the 2021 VS (Aus/1359417/21); (2) The NA gene in 2019 VS (Was/2/19) was closely related to those of the 2019–2020 GD strains, including the 2019–2022 ones, but these of other two VSs (Col/6/17 and Aus/1359417/21) were genetically different from those of the 2019–2022 GD strains, which suggested that the WHO recommended vaccine strains relied mainly on homologies of HA genes rather than those of NA genes.Transition and transversion in SNVThe number and ratio of purine and pyrimidine mutations in the nucleotide of each HA and NA gene were calculated according to the reference Bri/60/08 (Table 2). It was showed that (1) Ts mutations were mostly larger than Tv ones, with three increased (A → G↑, C → T↑ and G → A↑) during two stages and one decreased (T → C↓) in HA genes, and one increased (G → A↑) in NA genes; (2) Tv mutations usually were more significant than Ts ones, including two increased (C → A↑ and T → A↑) in HA gene during two stages, while the NA genes were increased and decreased once each (A → T↑ and T → A↓); (3) Tv mutations in HA genes might contributed to the influenza outbreaks after NPI (C → A↑↑ and T → A↑↑); (4) The nucleotide variation ratios of both HA and NA genes were in the following order, G → A, A → G, C → T, T → C, A → T, T → A, A → C, G → T, T → G and C → G (no G → C substitution).Table 2 Mutations of Ts/Tv on HA and NA genes during two stages.Full size tableEvolutionary selectionOn account of the dS/dN substitutions in the codons, evolutionary selections in both HA and NA genes in the present study were analyzed using both approaches FUBAR and MEME, shown in Table 3. Here the FUBAR had positive sites in HA genes including site 199, 214 and 563, where MEME had those including site 174, 214 and 563 (P < 0.10). Both methods were used for statistical assessment using Bayes Factor and MEME LogL. The positive sites in NA genes included the site 73 and 384 with FUBAR and only site 73 with MEME (P < 0.10) (Table 3, Supplementary Table S4). The positive selections suggested that these amino acid sites were under enormous external pressure. A lot of negative sites existed in FUBAR (Fig. 1).Table 3 Evolutionary selection on genes of influenza viruses.Full size tableFig. 1Positive selection of HA and NA genes analyzed by FUBAR and MEME. The negative sites were present in FUBAR, marked with small circle dots in blue.Full size imageEvolution comparisonComparing the two evolutionary indicators [the evolutionary rate (ER) and the Shannon entropy value (SV)], both ERs and SVs were significantly correlated in HA genes (RPearson = 0.690), meanwhile both also in NA genes (RPearson = 0.711); which indicated that both the ERs and SVs were consistent in the same gene (Fig. 2). The differences between two indicators might be that the ER focuses on all nucleotide mutations (dS and dN), and the SV mainly does on the amino acid site of the dN mutation.Fig. 2The evolutionary rates and entropy values of the sites on HA and NA [(a) ER; (b) SV].Full size imageBased on the Tajima’ Neutrality Test, the evolutionary selections were present (Supplementary Table S5). The Tajima` D Test is based on neutrality, if positive, common allele excess and if negative, rare alleles excess. It was indicated as follows, (1) Both SHA (195) and πHA (0.0109) were respectively more than SNA (176) and πNA (0.0095), but both psNA (0.1257) and ΘNA (0.0253) were respectively more than psHA (0.1116)and ΘHA (0.0225), which suggested that the dN was larger in HA than in NA and the dS was larger in NA than in HA; (2) Both HA and NA showed a higher rate of synonymous evolution than nonsynonymous evolution, while the DHA (− 1.7668) was larger than DNA (− 2.1355) due to the HA mainly being an antigenic domain and functional region.Genetic factors related to outbreakFor all HA gene mutations and outbreak influencing factors, the TwoStep cluster was used to explore the relationship among all the variables mentioned above, especially in the association of influenza outbreak events with genetic mutations. The findings in the TwoStep cluster were as follows, (1) Three clusters were mainly based on sampling dates, Ts and Tv, where Cluster 1 was completely separated from Cluster 2 and 3 and the Cluster 1 ended in the February 2020; (2) Cluster 1 isolated from Cluster 2 and 3 was contributed by the AA site 148 (B → P), 165(P → B), 199(P → A), 212(P → A) and 563(B → P), while Cluster 2 did from Cluster 1 and 3 was contributed by site 256 (P ↔ H); (3) Cluster 3 did from Cluster 1 and 2 was contributed by AA site 137 (B → P) and 142 (B → P), while the Cluster 3 started in the second half of 2021. According to the above analysis, the role of genetic evolution and mutation (the amino acid mutations preferring charge/pH) in the development of epidemic and outbreak could be preliminarily identified (Supplementary Tables S4 and S6).For all continuous and categorical variables in HA genes and disease outbreaks, the K-Mean Cluster was used to further analyze the relationship among all variables (Table 4). It was shown in the One-Way ANOVA of K-Mean Cluster (label cases by strain name) as follows (only show the significant results), (1) There were two clusters, including Cluster 1 in 2019–2020 and Cluster 2 in 2021–2022 (P < 0.001); (2) Three variables (Tv, Ts and Tv/Ts) were statistically different (P < 0.001); (3) AA sites included P137, P148, P199, P212, P214 and P563 were very significantly different (P < 0.001), as P256 as well (P = 0.002), but P188 (P = 0.302) and Outbreak (P = 0.089) were not significantly different between two clusters. Overall, the factors that determine the 2021–2022 influenza outbreak included epidemic time, Tv, Ts, Tv/Ts, P137(B → P), P148(B → P), P199(P → A), P212(P → A), P214(H → P) and P563(B → P) (Table 4, Supplementary Table S6).Table 4 Genetic variables related to the outbreaks analyzed by One-Way ANOVA.Full size tableDiscussionThe B/Victoria lineage stemmed from the 1988–1989 season, of which two distinct antigenic variants of influenza B virus were co-circulated, the B/Victoria and B/Yamagata lineages (Bv/By) with the reference strains B/Victoria/2/87 and B/Yamagata/16/88, respectively. The evolutionary dynamics of influenza B virus are complex and have been characterized by nucleotide insertions and deletions (indels) in the hemagglutinin (HA) gene and extensive reassortment events within and between the Bv and By lineages23. In this study, only strain GD/1557/2019 inserting 529AAAAACGAC537 in HA gene was similar to the vaccine strain B/Bri/60/08, which was different from others. On account of the vaccine strain Aus/1359417/21, the Bv strains circulating in 2022 had the highest homology with their HA gene but were different from those in other years (99.23 ± 0.22, F2022/Others = 74.78, P < 0.001). Some of influenza strains in the present study were isolated at the beginning of NPI (2020), being in fact a continuation of the 2019 epidemic and outbreaks. Moreover, from NPI (2020) to the end of April of 2022, only influenza Bv outbreaks (no H1N1 and no H3N2) occurred in southern China.This study included the analyses of nucleotides (molecular cluster, transitionransversion, evolutionary rate), amino acids (AA substitution, entropy, evolutionary selection, epitope), genes (HA/NA) and prevalence (epidemic/outbreak, different dates) and the relationship among them of Bv outbreaks. Although SNV occurs at random, the results are significant for the direction of biological evolution. From the results in the present study, the mutations were highly biased toward the specific amino acid, for example, the probability of GC transversion was one in 200,000 (only once) since 2008 (reference strain), but the probability of AG transition was 1–2 per thousand, which was faster than that of GC transversion. The evolutionary rates in this study were successively G → A, A → G, C → T, T → C, A → T, T → A, A → C, G → T, T → G and C → G, with the highest rate 10,000 times faster than the lowest rate. Compared with a study on SARS-CoV-2 pandemic spread during the first months, the frequency of both G → U and C → U substitutions increased, which suggested that the substitution spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 was determined by an interplay of factors, including intrinsic biases of the replication process, avoidance of CpG dinucleotides and other constraints exerted by the new host24.In this study, the epitope domain mutations including epitope A (120 loop, 137/142/144/199), B (150 loop, 165) and D (190 helix, 212/214) had high evolutionary rates, partially similar to a previous research23. The epidemic and outbreaks in southern China resulted from the mutations on HA genes, which were 1.59 times (2.15/1.36) faster than those on NA genes. As to the deeper reasons, the outbreaks here were associated with mutations of HA gene epitopes A, B and D. Compared with the epidemic in Germany during 2016–202025, a total of 13 substitutions were fixed over time (numbering in HA1 of Bri/60/08), including five in the 120-loop (R116H, I117V, N121T, K129N/D, K136E) and two substitutions in the 120-loop surrounding domain (K48E, N75K), one in the 150-loop (V146I), two in the 160-loop (E164D, N165K) and one in the 190-helix (S197N).Amino acids have been extensively studied as components of epitopes, while epitopes in infectious diseases involve epidemic, treatment, vaccines and so on26. The ionizing properties of amino acids are associated with the charged capacity, furthermore, with pathogenic adhesion and entry and molecular interaction between antigen and antibody, etc.; where interaction between antigen and antibody is involved in the multiply charged ion signals in amino acids27. Focusing on the epitope domain in this study, three polar amino acids (P137B/P199A/P212A) mutations occurred from 2019–2020 to 2021–2022 (P < 0.01), which affected the antigenicity of the epitope regions.Based on dS/dN substitution in the codon, there are certain errors in the evaluation of selective evolutionary sites. The site 214 and 563 in the HA genes and the site 73 in the NA genes in this study were the positive ones, which were evaluated by both approaches (FUBAR/MEME; P < 0.10)28. This suggested that the site 214 in HA genes was an AA in the epitope D (H214P) triggered off Bv outbreaks, and a positive selection site under the enormous external pressure in evolution as well.Entropy is usually used to evaluate the evolution as well29, while here the evolution was evaluated by both ER and SV, of which both were significantly correlated. Estimation of both rates of nucleotide substitution of HA and NA in Bv lineage were 2.05 × 10−3 s/s/y and 2.01 × 10−3 s/s/y, respectively23, while the RHA in this study was less than RNA (RHA = 0.690/RNA = 0.711), which suggested that the amino acid variations on HA were more active than the nucleotide variations, compared with those on NA. At the same time, both DHA (− 1.7668) and DNA (− 2.1355) in this study showed HA genes (especially in the five epitopes in HA1 region) were prone to variation, in other words, NA genes were more likely to evolve synonymous evolution rather than nonsynonymous one.The key role of charged amino acids has been widely studied in infectious diseases30. Here was a good model of the evolution of infectious disease pathogens (NPI/Bv outbreak only/Less distant transmission). In this study, the first stage entering the second stage of the Bv outbreak involved three polar AAs (N165K, P → H; G199E/K, P → A/B; N212E, P → A), substituted from the polar AAs into the basic, acidic/basic and acidic AAs, respectively; the second half of 2021 in the second stage (Cluster 3, Table S6) involved two polar AAs (H137Q/K/N, B → P; A142T, H → P), substituted from the basic and acidic AAs into the polar AAs, respectively. This suggested that the charge/pH preference for amino acid mutations is closely related (consistent) for the development trend of the outbreak. There are some similar reports, but with different research perspectives31. SNV adaptation is thus likely to have been associated with the influenza virus diversification across the outer environment and to have promoted their survival in extreme32. A genetic approach combined with potential epidemiological linkage enabled us to match data with previous reports on outbreaks or transmission chains, which may benefit public health actions33.ConclusionsWith the advent of COVID-19, the influenza epidemic affected by NPI had a closed, time-limited pattern, and only Bv outbreaks. The HA genes of Bv strains isolated in 2022 evolved further than the vaccine strain isolated in 2021 (Bv/Aus/1359417/21). The codon G → A transition in nucleotide was in the highest ratio but the transversion of C → A and T → A made the most significant contribution to the outbreaks. The epitope domain mutations occurred in the epitope A (AA 137/142/144/199), B (AA165) and D (AA 212/214). Amino acid mutations with polar, acidic and basic features are key factors in the 2021 Bv epidemic, in which the above mutational features alter the molecular structure, charged properties and molecular affinity of its epitope region. The amino acid sites 174, 199, 214 and 563 in HA genes and the sites 73 and 384 in NA genes were evolutionarily selected as the positive sites, which was under evolutionary pressure. The prevalent factors related to 2021–2022 influenza outbreak included epidemic timing, Tv, Ts, Tv/Ts, P137 (B → P), P148 (B → P), P199 (P → A), P212(P → A), P214(H → P) and P563(B → P). The preference of amino acid mutations for charge/pH could influence the trend of the epidemic/outbreak. Further exploratory studies employing mathematical and bioinformatics approaches based on clinical, public health, vaccine research and genetic information may facilitate further understanding of the deep interaction mechanisms of infectious disease transmission.

Share your Parkview story Two doctors weigh in on the importance of the flu shot Last Modified: September 04, 2024 Family Medicine With the passing of the Labor Day holiday weekend, we have officially entered flu season. This period, when influenza cases are heightened, lasts through March and brings the risk of extreme symptoms, hospitalization and even death. Two Parkview physicians passionate about prevention share their thoughts on the vaccine and how you can find the best option for you and your family. Why you need a flu shot This content was provided by Joshua Kline, MD, PPG – Family Medicine. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), every year, influenza sickens millions, hospitalizes hundreds of thousands and kills tens of thousands worldwide. It’s important to understand that influenza is not just a common cold. When medical professionals talk about influenza (the flu), we mean respiratory flu, not the stomach flu, which is caused by other viruses. While the flu is especially dangerous for anyone with a preexisting health condition (a weakened immune system, or heart or lung problems), it can be harmful for healthy people, too. I had a patient who was in his 40s and otherwise healthy who passed away from complications from influenza. It was heartbreaking, both for his family and for me. Even if you don’t get sick or experience symptoms from the virus, influenza is very contagious. You can be contagious before you realize that you even have it. That means you can spread it to others, some of whom may become extremely ill. Getting immunized helps keep everyone safe because it’s not just about you; it’s about everyone around you. This is especially true for those who are more vulnerable to serious flu illness, like babies and young children, older people and people with certain chronic health conditions. Here are a few things everyone should know about the flu vaccine: It’s the best way to prevent the flu. Hand washing is crucial, and staying away from sick people helps, but we can’t wash our hands every second, and we can’t always know who is sick. It’s true that the vaccine isn’t 100% effective (the effectiveness varies by year), but it’s your best option if you don’t want to get sick. The flu shot helps prevent doctor visits, hospitalization, flu complications and death. Even if you do get sick from the flu, vaccination has been shown in several studies to reduce the severity of the illness in people who get vaccinated but still get sick. You should get it early. The flu season runs from roughly September to March. The sooner you get it, the sooner you are protected. It’s best to get vaccinated before the end of October. People with an egg allergy can get the flu shot. If the allergy is severe, you should talk to your doctor. In those cases, people should be monitored and have medications to treat an allergic reaction ready, but it’s unlikely that anything will happen. There are very few people who shouldn’t get a flu shot. Children less than six months old or patients who had a definite allergic reaction to the vaccine are the only ones who can’t get a flu shot. Those with a history of Guillain-Barré syndrome should talk to their doctor, but that’s rare. If you are significantly ill, we will sometimes postpone the shot, but people with a minor illness like a cold can get it. There are some people who really need a flu shot. That includes babies and pregnant women, who are at higher risk of complications, as well as people with asthma, other lung diseases, heart problems, weakened immune systems or other chronic illnesses. You should call your doctor right away about getting vaccinated if you fall into one of these groups. You can’t catch the flu from the flu vaccine. The virus in the vaccine is inactivated. As with any vaccine, there can be side effects, like pain at the injection site or low-grade fever, but the shot cannot give you the flu. In Indiana and Ohio, you can get the flu shot at your doctor’s office or local pharmacy. While your physician or advanced practice provider would like you to get shots at our offices so that we have a record of it and can answer any questions, we really want you to be vaccinated, and we understand that getting to the office isn’t always easy. Many Parkview offices offer flu shots at any time or you can check with your local public health department or pharmacy. If you do get the flu shot at a pharmacy or a location other than the office, please bring documentation to your provider so that they can put it in their medical record. Are all flu shots created equal? This content was provided by Mark Mabus, MD, RPh, Chief Medical Informatics Officer, Parkview Health. The best possible way to prevent the flu is with an influenza vaccination. The CDC recommends the flu shot for everyone over six months of age. While the need might not be new information for you, you might be surprised to learn that there are different types of flu shots, or that all flu shots are not created equal. Every year, the CDC helps determine which strains of the flu the vaccine will prevent. This changes every year, hence the need to get a vaccine every year. Vaccine manufacturers also have different types of vaccines, including those that prevent against three versus four strains of the flu, regular dose and high dose, as well as injection versus nose spray formulations. So, as a patient, how do you know which type of vaccine would be best for you? The nasal spray formulation sounds enticing because it doesn’t involve needles. This is an option for only some patients. Parents may choose to have this type for their children if the child has an extreme fear of needles. The nasal spray flu vaccine is only approved from ages 2-50 and cannot be given to patients with certain health conditions. There are a number of health conditions that raise your risk of influenza. These include smoking, diabetes, heart disease, liver disease, kidney disease, obesity and a weakened immune system, among others. There is some evidence that a high dose or different manufacturing process in the flu shot may provide more benefit than the “regular” flu shots for these patients. At Parkview, we are committed to improving your health, and we want you to have the best options for managing your well-being. Using the CDC's guidelines, our providers and pharmacists have established clinical criteria for the use of the different flu vaccines. In my role as Chief Medical Informatics Officer, I have been able to integrate our electronic medical record system into this process. Our software searches your health information, located in your chart, and matches that with the most appropriate vaccine for you. So, you can be assured that if you get your flu shot from Parkview, you will be getting the best available vaccine for you.

This study aimed to elucidate NTB’s clinical characteristics, diagnostics, and therapeutic approaches. Diagnostics included symptom assessment, microbiological testing that confirmed all patients were positive for IAV H1N1 with a predominant S. aureus co-infection, and bronchoscopy. The patients predominantly exhibited fever, cough, and dyspnea. Laboratory analysis revealed decreased lymphocyte counts and elevated infection markers like C-reactive protein and procalcitonin. Chest computed tomography (CT) scans detected tracheobronchial obstructions in half of the cases, while bronchoscopy showed severe mucosal congestion, edema, necrosis, and purulent-hemorrhagic exudates. Treatments encompassed comprehensive strategies like oxygen therapy, intubation, bronchoscopic interventions, thoracentesis, oseltamivir, and a regimen of antibiotics. Our findings suggested potential correlations between clinical markers, notably lymphocyte count and procalcitonin, and clinical interventions such as the number of rescues and intensive care unit (ICU) duration. This research highlights the importance of early detection and the role of bronchoscopy and specific markers in assessing NTB, advocating for continued research in larger cohorts to better understand its clinical trajectory and refine treatment approaches for this challenging pediatric disease.

While most IAV infections culminate in mild respiratory manifestations such as fever, cough, and sore throat, a select few evolve into grave complications, including bacterial pneumonia, myocarditis, and encephalitis. Among these, necrotizing tracheobronchitis (NTB) stands out as an infrequent but potentially fatal complication1.NTB is characterized by tracheobronchial mucosal damage that can lead to necrosis and pseudomembrane formation, with both infectious and non-infectious origins. The sloughing of necrotic tissue and the pseudomembrane may induce acute airway obstruction, constituting a significant life hazard2,3,4. Clinically, NTB bears resemblances to pseudomembranous tracheobronchitis (PMTB)2. Due to its relative rarity, NTB is often reported in literature as individual case studies. Although Aspergillus is frequently identified as an etiological agent5,6, occasional reports have linked IAV7, Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus)8, Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M. pneumoniae)3,9, and other pathogens10,11,12. Non-infective triggers notably involve neonatal tracheal intubation13, with sporadic associations to radiation therapy and rheumatoid arthritis14,15,16. To our knowledge, roughly ten NTB cases have been ascribed to concomitant IAV and S. aureus infections17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24, with half resulting in mortality. Among these, pediatric patients account for four instances17,19,24, of which three were fatal. While a significant proportion of NTB cases can be attributed to immunodeficiency9, those co-infected with IAV and S. aureus typically manifest robust immune responses. Understanding these varied causes of NTB, especially in conjunction with IAV and S. aureus infections, is crucial.In light of the rarity and marked severity of NTB, combined with its intricate clinical implications, we amassed data from six pediatric NTB cases treated in our Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) in March 2023, each stemming from co-infections of IAV and S. aureus. With this investigation, we aspire to elucidate the clinical trajectories, findings from diagnostics, employed therapeutic regimens, and the eventual outcomes of these patients. Our ultimate goal is to bolster clinical insight, explore potential risk contributors, and highlight essential interventions that might contribute to more favorable patient outcomes.MethodsPatients and data collectionWe conducted a retrospective analysis of a cohort of six patients diagnosed with NTB who were admitted to our PICU in March 2023. Our data collection included their clinical presentations, salient findings from pathogen detection, infection markers, chest imaging, and bronchoscopic evaluations. Notably, bronchoscopy served dual purposes: it provided both diagnostic insights and therapeutic avenues. Upon clinical evaluation of airway obstruction in the PICU, bedside bronchoscopy was collaboratively performed by a multidisciplinary team, including bronchoscopists, otolaryngologists, intensive care physicians, endoscopy nurses, and critical care nurses. Under sedation, the bronchoscope was inserted through either the nasal cavity or the endotracheal tube. In cases where tracheal lumen obstruction was identified, biopsy forceps, foreign body forceps, and foreign body retrieval baskets were utilized repeatedly to remove the obstructing material. Following the removal of obstructions, saline lavage and suction were performed to clear the airway. Pathogen detection was conducted using a combination of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) on pharyngeal swabs, sputum, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). RT-PCR was specifically employed to target viral ribonucleic acid (RNA), including that of IAV. mNGS facilitated a comprehensive analysis of the microbial community, enabling the identification of a broad spectrum of viral, bacterial, and fungal pathogens. Additionally, gram staining was performed on sputum and BALF samples to differentiate between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. These samples were cultured under aerobic and anaerobic conditions to isolate bacterial pathogens and assess their antibiotic sensitivities using standard microbiological techniques, such as susceptibility testing. Moreover, we meticulously documented the therapeutic strategies employed. These strategies spanned procedural measures, such as endotracheal intubation and closed thoracic drainage, as well as a spectrum of pharmacological treatments. We diligently recorded outcome data to gauge the efficacy and ramifications of these interventions.Diagnostic criteriaWhile standardized diagnostic criteria for NTB are currently lacking, our clinical diagnoses drew heavily from the prevailing literature. This literature places emphasis on clinical presentations, microbiological findings, and endoscopic results16. Notably, some experts regard bronchoscopy as the gold standard for NTB diagnosis4. A diagnosis is corroborated when bronchoscopy unveils tracheobronchial mucosal necrosis and pseudomembrane formation. Furthermore, should a biopsy of the tracheobronchial mucosa display fibrinoid necrosis with concomitant inflammatory cell infiltration, the diagnostic assertion is further strengthened.Statistical analysisIn our statistical evaluation, the Shapiro–Wilk test was first employed to assess the normality of data distribution. Given the constrained sample size and potential outliers, we presented descriptive statistics as medians (M), accompanied by the first (Q1) and third (Q3) quartiles, represented as M (Q1-Q3). To identify differences in infection markers before and after treatment, we utilized the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, with p-values adjusted for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate (FDR). The paired Vargha-Delaney A values further aided in discerning the magnitude of group differences. Because some data did not follow a normal distribution, we systematically employed the Spearman rank correlation test for correlation analyses. For approximating confidence intervals for the Spearman coefficient, we used Fisher’s Z transformation25.Our regression analysis began with univariate linear regression due to the constraints of the dataset. Potential nonlinearities led us to consider polynomial regression. When faced with outliers or high leverage points, we resorted to robust linear regression. For the count variable ‘number of rescues (NumRescues)’, our initial analysis using negative binomial regression resulted in statistically non-significant coefficients. Given this result, we addressed zero counts by incrementing them by one, then applied a logarithmic transformation, and subsequently used linear regression. To ensure the robustness of the regression model, we verified major assumptions through residual plots, quantile–quantile (QQ) plots, and various statistical tests, including the Shapiro–Wilk, Jarque–Bera, Durbin–Watson, and Levene’s test. A two-tailed p-value less than 0.05 indicated statistical significance. All analytical procedures were performed in a Python 3.8 environment, leveraging libraries such as pandas (1.2.3), numpy (1.19.2), scipy (1.6.1), statsmodels (0.12.2), matplotlib (3.3.4), and seaborn (0.11.1).Ethical approvalThis study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Children’s Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, documented under Approval Number 2023-IRB-0241-P-01. All methods were carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and other relevant guidelines and regulations. Written informed consent was obtained from the parents of the children included in this study for participation and publication of identifiable details and accompanying images. Copies of the written consents are available for review by the Editor of this journal.ResultsPatient characteristicsAmong the six patients, the median age was 9Y2M (6Y1M-9Y7M). The cohort included four males and two females, with males comprising two-thirds. The median body weight (BW) was 28.0 kg (20.8–31.1 kg). All patients were previously healthy, with no reported history of immunodeficiency disorders or recurrent infections. Detailed clinical data for each patient are provided in Table 1.Table 1 Patient characteristics and infection markers upon admission.Full size tablePre-admission statusPatients were admitted a median of 2.5 days (2.0–3.8 days) post symptom onset. Two had previously been hospitalized at different institutions for durations of 2 and 4 days, respectively. From the onset of illness, fever was observed in all patients. Furthermore, in addition to this universal symptom, two patients predominantly displayed coughs, three experienced shortness of breath, and one described chest pain. All patients denied any history of foreign body aspiration. Clinical data for each patient are detailed in Table 1.Clinical status upon admissionVital signs were recorded as follows: the median temperature (T) was 38.4 °C (38.1–38.5 °C); the median pulse rate (PR) was 155 bpm (131–169 bpm); the median respiratory rate (RR) was 47 bpm (43–48 bpm); and blood pressure (BP) measurements showed a median of 109/76 mmHg (systolic: 104–110 mmHg, diastolic: 71–78 mmHg). The peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) was determined to be 96% (95–97%). Upon their arrival, all patients required oxygen support: one utilized a nasal cannula, four made use of face masks, and one was intubated. During physical examinations, tachypnea and visible retractions were evident in all patients. For one patient, breath sounds were distinctly reduced on the right side, three presented with moist rales, while the remaining two showed no signs of either dry or moist rales. Comprehensive immunological assessments included measurements of immunoglobulins and complement components, with values within normal ranges: IgG 8.41 g/L (7.79–10.89 g/L), IgA 1.39 g/L (1.12–1.67 g/L), IgM 0.80 g/L (0.57–0.97 g/L), C3 1.13 g/L (0.97–1.28 g/L), C4 0.33 g/L (0.24–0.44 g/L), and IgE 110.9 IU/mL (23.2–282.0 IU/mL). Cellular profiles revealed variations, with CD19 at 37.80% (36.00–39.00%), CD3 at 36.89% (34.50–42.72%), CD4 at 17.77% (17.30–20.33%), CD8 at 13.77% (10.35–18.60%), and CD3−CD16+CD56+ at 6.60% (5.75 − 17.00%). Despite these variations, no evidence of underlying immunodeficiencies was found.Evaluation of infection markersDuring hospitalization, we assessed several infection markers in patients, including white blood cell count (WBC), lymphocyte count (LC), C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-10 (IL-10). Here, “Init” refers to initial values upon admission; “Max” to peak values; “Min” to the lowest recorded values; and “Final” to values from the last examination before discharge. Initial infection markers upon admission are detailed in Table 1.For WBC, initial analyses revealed significant differences between InitWBC and MinWBC, as well as between MinWBC and MaxWBC (p < 0.05, Fig. 1a). However, these distinctions were not significant after FDR adjustment. Effect size analysis showed an A value of 1.00 between InitWBC and MinWBC and an A value of 0 for the comparison of MinWBC and MaxWBC. Concerning LC, all comparisons exhibited significant differences (p < 0.05, Fig. 1b), except for the MaxLC versus FinalLC comparison. Post FDR correction, the difference between InitLC and MinLC was no longer significant, but other comparisons maintained their significance (p < 0.05). Effect size yielded an A value of 0.92 for InitLC versus MinLC and an A value of 0 for both comparisons involving InitLC and MinLC against MaxLC and FinalLC.Fig. 1Dynamics of in-hospital infection markers and their correlations.

PCT showcased significant variances between InitPCT and FinalPCT, and between MaxPCT and FinalPCT (corrected p < 0.05, A = 1.00, Fig. 1d). With IL-6, a significant initial difference was noted between MaxIL-6 and FinalIL-6, which turned non-significant after FDR correction. Importantly, the effect size, as denoted by the A value, was 1.00 (Fig. 1e). For IL-10, marked differences were detected between InitIL-10 and FinalIL-10, and between MaxIL-10 and FinalIL-10 (corrected p < 0.05, A = 1.00, Fig. 1f).Correlation analyses underscored a strong negative correlation between InitLC and InitIL-6 (ρ = − 0.94, p = 0.005, Fig. 1g). MinLC negatively correlated with both MaxIL-6 and MaxIL-10 (ρ = − 0.89, p = 0.019, Fig. 1h). Additionally, a substantial positive correlation existed between MaxIL-6 and MaxIL-10 (ρ = 0.89, p = 0.019).Microbiological findingsOf the six patients evaluated, four tested positive for IAV H1N1 within the first 2 days of admission using pharyngeal swab, sputum, or BALF analyses via either RT-PCR or mNGS. Additionally, mNGS evaluations of BALFs diagnosed the other two patients with IAV H1N1 on the fourth day post-admission.Upon admission, Gram-positive cocci (G+ cocci) were detected in the sputum smear or BALF smear of two patients. Between the third and sixth days post-admission, five patients tested positive for S. aureus through sputum culture, BALF culture, or mNGS. Among them, four were confirmed to have Methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA), and one was identified with Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA).Additionally, M. pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae (H. influenzae) were identified in the BALF of one patient through mNGS. In another patient, although elevated M. pneumoniae IgM antibodies were observed, M. pneumoniae nucleic acids were absent in respiratory specimens. However, adenovirus nucleic acids were positively identified in the BALF via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. Detailed microbiological distributions can be found in Table 2.Table 2 Initial diagnostic findings and pathological results.Full size tableRadiological findingsWithin the first three days after the emergence of symptoms, chest computed tomography (CT) imaging for the six patients demonstrated marked infectious changes within the lung parenchyma. The majority presented with lung consolidation and pleural effusion. Notably, three patients had evidence of tracheobronchial obstruction, resulting in bronchial narrowing and atelectasis (Fig. 2a). Detailed information can be found in Table 2.Fig. 2Evolution of chest CT findings across disease progression. (a) Early-stage chest CT reveals a foreign object within the trachea; (b) Mid-course chest CT displays signs of pneumonia and pneumothorax; (c) Convalescent-stage chest CT shows improvement in both pneumonia and pneumothorax, with the presence of a pulmonary cavity.Full size imageAs the days advanced, especially between days 5 and 15, the radiological manifestations of pneumonia intensified across all patients. A majority, four out of six, presented with atelectasis and lung consolidation. Concurrently, conditions such as pneumothorax or subcutaneous emphysema emerged in five patients, with pleural effusion also being a prominent finding in the same number of individuals (Fig. 2b).In the later stages of the disease, predominantly after two weeks, all patients demonstrated an improvement in pulmonary inflammatory changes compared to earlier stages. Instances of pneumothorax, subcutaneous emphysema, and pleural effusion also started to resolve. However, one patient developed a new pulmonary cavity, and another exhibited a more pronounced local bronchiectasis compared to earlier imaging findings (Fig. 2c).Bronchoscopic observations and proceduresUpon hospitalization, bronchoscopic evaluations were conducted for all patients. The primary examination displayed marked congestion, edema, and necrotic erosion across the tracheal and bronchial mucosa. A delicate white pseudomembrane, prone to bleeding upon contact, was discerned. The airways were predominantly filled with purulent-hemorrhagic secretions. Notably, the trachea of three patients was obstructed by abundant purulent-hemorrhagic materials. Using bronchoscopic instruments, substantial pseudomembranous fragments and cast-like sputum were extracted. Saline lavage was then administered to cleanse the mucoid and purulent secretions. Additionally, mucosal erosions and necrosis were apparent in the pharynx of three patients (Fig. 3a). Detailed bronchoscopic findings are provided in Table 2.Fig. 3Bronchoscopic evaluation of airway mucosal damage and recovery. (a) Initial bronchoscopy showing erosion of the pharyngeal mucosa, necrotic formations within the trachea, and the presence of a pseudomembrane in the left main bronchus. (b) Intermediate stage bronchoscopy revealing continued congestion and edema in the pharyngeal mucosa, mucosal erosion at the tracheal carina, and a mucus plug observed at the left second carina. (c) Recovery stage bronchoscopy indicating improved mucosal erosion in the glottal region, persistent congestion at the tracheal carina, and a notable reduction in the edema of the left upper bronchial mucosa.Full size imageA subsequent assessment after 5–7 days revealed persistent mucosal congestion and edema in the cohort. Some demonstrated recovery in areas that were previously eroded or necrotic. The airways mainly housed yellow viscous or purulent secretions, and a sputum plug was identified in one patient (Fig. 3b).During the convalescence period, bronchoscopic evaluations showcased patent airways across all patients. Although mucosal congestion persisted, the earlier observed necrotic regions and erosions exhibited marked healing. The airways predominantly held yellow or white viscous secretions. In some instances, mucoid plugs were detected, which were subsequently lavaged (Fig. 3c).Histopathological examinations of bronchial biopsiesDuring the bronchoscopic procedure, biopsies were obtained from three distinct patients. Subsequent histopathological evaluations consistently revealed fibrinoid necrosis in bronchial tissues, accompanied by exudative changes and significant inflammatory cell infiltration (refer to Fig. 4). Detailed histopathological findings are provided in Table 2.Fig. 4Histopathological examinations of a consistent bronchial site visualized at varying magnifications, using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining technique. Fibrinoid necrosis is denoted by the black arrows, while the red arrows indicate the regions of inflammatory cell infiltration.Full size imageTreatmentUpon admission, all six patients required supplemental oxygen. Two exhibited milder symptoms and did not necessitate tracheal intubation. One patient was emergently intubated outside the hospital setting, and the remaining three were intubated within the first 1–2 days after admission. During their hospital stay, each of the four intubated patients underwent 1–3 emergency interventions. These included six instances related to airway obstructions due to endogenous foreign bodies, two due to pneumothorax, and one episode of septic shock resulting from a severe infection.All patients underwent bronchoscopic examinations, lavage, and foreign body removal within a median timeframe of 1.0 (1.0–1.8) days following admission. Following these procedures, five patients received thoracentesis and closed thoracic drainage. Notably, drainage persisted for 40 days in one patient due to an unresolved pneumothorax.Upon diagnosing IAV infection, oseltamivir was immediately prescribed to all patients. Given the potential risk of severe bacterial co-infections, broad-spectrum antibiotics were initiated early in the treatment course. Additionally, either vancomycin or linezolid was employed to address Gram-positive bacterial infections. Two patients, diagnosed with concurrent M. pneumoniae infection, were additionally treated with azithromycin. All patients received methylprednisolone to counteract inflammation, with four also undergoing intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy.A detailed summary of critical clinical procedures, their timings, durations, and frequencies post-onset, is provided in Fig. 5. Specific treatment interventions for each patient are detailed in Table 3.Fig. 5Clinical intervention timelines and treatment durations post-disease onset. (a) Median days post-onset for various clinical interventions, including days from onset to admission (DOTA), time to intubation (IntubationTime), initial rescue time (InitRescueTime), initial bronchoscopy time (InitBronchTime), initial thoracentesis time (InitThoracentesisTime), and initial closed thoracic drainage time (InitCTDrainageTime).

The error bars represent the IQR.Full size imageTable 3 Interventions, medication treatments, and outcomes.Full size tableClinical outcomesAmong the six patients, one encountered an airway obstruction attributed to an endogenous foreign body. This patient required multiple cardiopulmonary resuscitation interventions, subsequently developing neurological impairment. Upon achieving clinical stability, the individual was transferred to a rehabilitation facility. Conversely, the remaining five patients experienced a successful discharge, exhibiting a favorable post-treatment recovery. Detailed outcomes for each patient are provided in Table 3.Correlation and regression analysisIn our comprehensive analysis, we explored correlations among various biophysical markers and clinical parameters, with a particular focus on emergency interventions, mechanical ventilation duration, and hospital stay duration. The Spearman correlation revealed significant associations of InitPCT, MinLC, NumThoracentesis, and PR with NumRescues. However, these associations were not confirmed when assessed using negative binomial regression. After log-transforming NumRescues and applying linear regression, a notable association emerged between MinLC and the transformed NumRescues (β = − 3.31, p = 0.012, R2 = 0.829, Fig. 6a).Fig. 6Correlation and regression analyses of biophysical markers, clinical interventions and patient outcome measures.

(e) Quadratic polynomial and robust regressions of MaxWBC vs. DurHospStay.Full size imageSignificant linear relationships were discerned between PR, InitPCT, NumRescues, and MechVentDur. The respective coefficients for MechVentDur were as follows: PR (β = 0.11, p = 0.013, R2 = 0.818), InitPCT (β = 0.25, p = 0.038, R2 = 0.698), and NumRescues (β = 2.63, p = 0.013, R2 = 0.822), visualized in Fig. 6b. Associations between InitPCT, NumBronchoscopies, NumRescues, and MechVentDur with DurICUStay were also observed. The linear regression coefficients for these associations included: InitPCT (β = 0.28, p = 0.003, R2 = 0.912), NumBronchoscopies (β = 1.41, p = 0.016, R2 = 0.803), NumRescues (β = 2.58, p = 0.016, R2 = 0.802), and MechVentDur (β = 0.86, p = 0.025, R2 = 0.755), depicted in Fig. 6c. A significant correlation between DurCTDrainage and OxygenTherapyDur was also evident (β = 0.87, p < 0.001, R2 = 0.998, Fig. 6d).While MaxWBC showed a positive correlation with DurHospStay (ρ = 0.94, p = 0.005), it was not statistically significant in the linear regression (R2 = 0.599, p = 0.071). A quadratic polynomial regression, however, indicated a nuanced nonlinear relationship (R2 = 0.893, p = 0.035). Data diagnostics pinpointed two high-leverage points, which were supported by a robust linear regression presenting significant quadratic terms (constant β₀ = 20.92, p = 0.006; linear term β₁ = -1.21, p = 0.110; quadratic term β₂ = 0.05, p = 0.006, Fig. 6e). Based on the parameters derived from the robust linear regression with higher precision coefficients (not shown), an inflection point at a MaxWBC value of 13.16 × 109/L was mathematically determined, signifying a critical threshold where the relationship between MaxWBC and DurHospStay alters.In assessing our regression models, the majority of the assumptions were upheld. The Shapiro–Wilk test identified deviations in residuals’ normality for the models linking NumRescues to MechVentDur and NumBronchoscopies to DurICUStay. Nevertheless, subsequent validations using the Jarque–Bera test and graphical analyses confirmed the overall normality of residuals. These observed discrepancies may be attributed to our constrained sample size.DiscussionDuring the 2023 influenza season, we examined six pediatric NTB cases linked to IAV and S. aureus. These children primarily manifested fever, cough, and dyspnea, concurrent with a reduction in LC and elevations in CRP, PCT, IL-6, and IL-10. Influenza was promptly diagnosed through RT-PCR or mNGS of respiratory samples, while bacterial involvement was confirmed via smears, cultures, and mNGS. Initial chest CT may reveal potential airway obstructions, with bronchoscopy confirming tracheal mucosal necrosis. The rapidity of disease progression and significant risk of airway obstruction underscore the imperative of early intervention. Essential treatments encompassed oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilation, bronchoscopic procedures, thoracic drainage, and timely initiation of antivirals, antibiotics, and corticosteroids. Moreover, we observed potential correlations between initial PR and PCT with mechanical ventilation duration. The nadir LC appeared to be inversely associated with the frequency of emergency interventions, and peak WBC exhibited a non-linear relationship with the length of hospitalization, initially negative, then becoming positive. Other vital clinical parameters, including the frequency of emergency interventions, number of bronchoscopies, and duration of closed thoracic drainage, seemed to be associated with variations in mechanical ventilation, ICU stays, and oxygen therapy durations.The pathogenesis of this condition remains incompletely understood, but it is potentially associated with the synergistic interplay between IAV and S. aureus. IAV predominantly replicates within the airway and alveolar epithelial cells, leading to cellular damage and a compromise of barrier integrity, which in turn elicits extensive immune cell infiltration. Owing to the degradation of this epithelial barrier and altered immune defenses, secondary bacterial infections become more prevalent, with Streptococcus pneumoniae and S. aureus standing out as primary culprits26. Notably, strains of S. aureus, especially those producing Panton–Valentine leukocidin (PVL), exhibit a specific affinity for the exposed basement membrane following epithelial shedding. The released PVL targets and disrupts newly recruited polymorphonuclear leukocytes, resulting in the liberation of inflammatory mediators. In the context of an IAV infection, the phagocytic capacity of alveolar macrophages diminishes, permitting unhindered bacterial proliferation. This combined action of IAV and S. aureus results in severe tracheobronchial and pulmonary lesions, manifesting as NTB and necrotizing pneumonia23,27.Recognizing early clinical manifestations of NTB is pivotal for accurate diagnosis and timely intervention. In our cohort, the six observed patients predominantly fell within the school-aged bracket. While the literature primarily reports pediatric NTB cases between ages 7 and 9 years17,19, it also highlights occurrences in younger children, particularly between 1 and 3 years24. Our observations confirm this trend and extend to cases in children aged 1Y11M and 5Y2M. This suggests that, although NTB primarily affects school-aged children, it can also present in younger age groups. However, our study’s limited sample size may restrict the generalizability of these findings to the broader NTB population. NTB co-infected by IAV and S. aureus initially presents with influenza-like symptoms, occasionally accompanied by dyspnea and chest pain. Some patients may also experience hoarseness if the larynx is involved. As it evolves, airway obstruction becomes prevalent, mirroring most case narratives17,19,24. Early in the disease trajectory, we detected a pronounced elevation in infection-related markers, namely CRP, PCT, IL-6, and IL-10. These findings are consistent with previous research indicating the utility of these biomarkers in diagnosing bacterial infections, particularly those involving the bloodstream28. Notably, elevated levels of IL-6 and IL-10 have been identified as reliable indicators of disease severity in pediatric patients with sepsis in ICU29. The early detection of these elevated markers in our patients suggests the presence of a severe bacterial infection. Although WBC levels may appear normal or slightly reduced, there’s a marked decline in LC, corroborating previous studies30. Expedient etiological identification is of the essence. Respiratory assays, encompassing influenza antigens, RT-PCR, and mNGS, bolster early IAV discernment. Even though pinpointing bacterial origins early on poses challenges, smear tests swiftly discern G+ cocci, and mNGS heightens diagnostic precision. Bacterial culture, nonetheless, remains instrumental for tailoring antibiotic regimens. In our cases, initial chest CTs for three patients revealed tracheal and bronchial opacities suggestive of foreign bodies. Yet, a majority in existing literature display merely pulmonary inflammatory alterations in early scans, with a scant few indicating bronchial wall thickening or foreign shadows18,24. This hints at the circumscribed diagnostic potential of early chest CTs. A conclusive diagnosis predominantly hinges on bronchoscopy, a consensus echoed across numerous case reports17,19,24. Conclusively, while NTB’s onset might mimic severe influenza, a notable surge in infectious markers often suggests an ensuing bacterial superinfection. Accurate early etiological discernment, especially if bronchial anomalies are evident on initial CTs, warrants immediate bronchoscopic evaluation and robust intervention, preempting potential airway obstructions.Exploring factors linked to disease severity can offer insights, though interpretations must be approached with caution due to our study’s small sample size. We investigated correlations between initial clinical presentations, laboratory results, essential clinical interventions and the severity spectrum of the disease. Our analysis observed a notable negative association between MinLC and NumRescues, suggesting that lower LC levels may necessitate more frequent medical interventions. This association, supported by log-transformed linear regression, underscores the need for cautious interpretation due to the small sample size. A study indicates that severe influenza infections correlate with significant reductions in LC30. Aligning with these findings, recent studies have shown that reductions in specific lymphocyte subsets, notably T cells and Natural Killer cells (NK cells), correlate with increased disease severity in respiratory infections like coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and influenza, highlighting their role in prognosis and treatment planning31,32. Furthermore, influenza infections have been shown to suppress Th17 and γδ T cell functions and potentially inhibit NK cell responses, reducing the production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and consequently increasing bacterial burden33. This is consistent with the cellular immune findings in our six patients, all of whom showed decreased proportions of T cells and NK cells upon admission. This result aligns with a recent case of an adult with influenza B and S. aureus co-infection leading to NTB34. Additionally, we observed significant negative correlations between InitLC and InitIL-6, as well as between MinLC and MaxIL-6 and MaxIL-10, suggesting intricate interactions between decreased LC and increased cytokine release. Research on COVID-19 has suggested that early CD3+ T cell counts and IL-6 levels may serve as predictive markers for severe disease progression in viral infections35,36, raising the possibility that similar markers could be relevant in our study of influenza infections, warranting further investigation. These preliminary findings underscore the necessity for larger, more definitive studies to confirm these potential associations and further elucidate the role of lymphocytes and cytokines in the progression of severe respiratory infections.In evaluating NTB severity, we explored associations with MechVentDur and DurICUStay, finding a notable positive correlation between InitPCT and both variables. Furthermore, a potent positive relationship between MechVentDur and DurICUStay hinted at potential collinearity, which warrants careful scrutiny. Elevated initial PCT levels might serve as an early indication of an impending bacterial infection37,38, which could necessitate extended durations of mechanical ventilation and ICU stays. A significant relationship was observed between PR and MechVentDur. Given the variability of PR across different pediatric age groups, and acknowledging that the patient ages in our study ranged predominantly from 6Y1M to 9Y7M, PR at admission might tentatively correlate with initial disease severity. Clinically, severe infections in children are commonly associated with increased heart rates39,40,41. Additionally, a nuanced nonlinear relationship was revealed between MaxWBC and the duration of hospital stay: an initial shortening in stay duration with an increase in MaxWBC, followed by an elongation upon exceeding the 13.16 × 109/L threshold. This pattern could reflect the sequence of an initial IAV infection with normalized or reduced WBC, followed by a subsequent S. aureus infection increasing the WBC count. Prior studies suggest that higher WBC counts may be associated with increased severity of infections such as COVID-19 and sepsis, indicating their potential value in predicting patient outcomes42,43. These observations reveal the possible role of WBC counts in monitoring and managing severe infectious diseases.From an interventional standpoint, notable associations were observed between NumRescues and both MechVentDur and DurICUStay, between NumBronchoscopies and DurICUStay, and between DurCTDrainage and OxygenTherapyDur. Increased rescue events may indicate heightened disease severity, potentially correlating with longer durations of mechanical ventilation and ICU stays. The frequency of bronchoscopies might act as an indicator of the extent of airway mucosal damage; significant damage may necessitate more frequent bronchoscopic interventions to mitigate respiratory obstructions, potentially leading to prolonged ICU stays. Notably, in the six patients discussed, pneumothorax was the primary reason for continuous closed thoracic drainage. Given that oxygen therapy is a primary intervention for pneumothorax44, its synchronization with DurCTDrainage is consistent with established clinical guidelines. Our study contributes to understanding how these clinical interventions may influence the course of the disease.Our investigation included six cases of NTB. Within this group, G+ cocci were observed on a smear in one patient, but culturing for S. aureus was unsuccessful; two additional cases were marked by concurrent pathogen infections. These variations in etiology underscore the importance of meticulous clinical evaluation, which influences the interpretation of infectious markers and the strategic planning of treatment regimens. The study’s retrospective design inherently carries limitations such as the absence of a randomized control group and the potential for confounding factors. The rarity of NTB further constrained our sample size. While correlation and regression analyses were utilized to examine significant biomarkers, therapeutic interventions, and treatment progressions, the small cohort size limited the application of complex multivariate regression, thereby restraining a comprehensive analysis of the relationships between variables. Our statistical results suggest associations between specific biomarkers and disease progression, yet they should be interpreted with caution and not be construed as confirmation of causality. Future research efforts should aim to increase sample sizes to enhance the understanding of NTB and its clinical markers, thereby better informing clinical practice.ConclusionIn conclusion, this study explores the clinical manifestations, diagnostic methods, and treatment measures of pediatric NTB caused by co-infections of IAV and S. aureus. Our findings underscore the importance of early detection, through advanced diagnostic modalities and timely intervention to mitigate severe complications of NTB. Factors such as diminished LC and elevated infection markers were examined as potential indicators of disease severity. Although the limited sample size warrants cautious interpretation, our study provides a foundation for understanding the clinical course of NTB. Continued investigations with larger cohorts are essential to further elucidate this condition and optimize therapeutic strategies for pediatric populations.

This 2005 electron microscope image shows an avian influenza A H5N1 virion. (Cynthia Goldsmith, Jackie Katz/CDC via AP) CDC confirms Missouri's first case of influenza A bird flu By Elizabeth Barmeier St. Louis PUBLISHED 4:39 PM CT Sep. 06, 2024 PUBLISHED 4:39 PM CDT Sep. 06, 2024 SHARE JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. â The first human case of influenza A bird flu in Missouri was confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The case was detected through the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Servicesâ (DHSS) ongoing influenza surveillance program, according to an online press release. The risk of infection among the general public remains low. Avian influenza A (H5) is primarily found in wild birds, poultry, dairy cows and other animals, which can occasionally infect humans through close contact with infected animals or contaminated environments. The Missouri State Public Health Laboratory received a specimen from a patient who was hospitalized on Aug. 22. The adult patient, who remains anonymous, has underlying medical conditions and tested positive for influenza A. The patient had reported no exposure to animals, and the patient has since recovered and was discharged home, according to the press release. âThe Missouri State Public Health Laboratory conducted additional testing to determine the influenza subtype. This resulted in the presumptive detection of the H5 subtype,â press release states. âThe specimen was forwarded to CDC for additional testing and was confirmed as H5 subtype of flu, also known as a bird flu, or avian flu.â Further virus characterization is underway at the CDC. Since 2022, this is the 15th human case of H5 reported in the U.S. with 14 reported this year, according to the press release. H5 infection in dairy cattle has not been reported in Missouri, while some H5 cases in commercial or backyard flocks and wild birds have been reported. Nationally, this was the first H5 case found as part of a flu surveillance rather than the targeted H5-outbreak surveillance, which has identified all other cases. The stateâs flu surveillance system includes a collaborative partnership between clinical laboratories, Missouri health care providers, local public health agencies and the Missouri State Public Health Laboratory, according to the press release. âDHSS continues to closely monitor available data from influenza surveillance systems, and there has been no sign of unusual influenza activity in people, including no increase in emergency room visits for influenza and no increase in laboratory detection of human influenza cases in Missouri.â Spectrum News Our Journalists Contact Careers Advertise With Us TERMS Your Privacy Rights California Consumer Privacy Rights California Consumer Limit the Use of My Sensitive Personal Information Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information/Opt-Out of Targeted Advertising Â© 2024, Charter Communications, all rights reserved.DHVI Receives Contract to Manufacture Investigational Avian Flu Vaccines | Duke Health Duke Health Skip to main content Open Mobile Search Menu Search Search Home Who We Are Back title Who We Are Mission, Vision & Values Duke Health Leadership Teams Strategic Planning Framework Facts & Statistics History Community Health Government Relations Careers Diversity Duke Health Brand Center Duke Health Leadership Back title Duke Health Leadership Team Clinical Enterprise Back title Clinical Enterprise Health System Overview Our Hospitals Financial Information Primary & Specialty Clinics Networks & Affiliates Research & Education Back title Research & Education School of Medicine School of Nursing Duke-NUS Medical School Global Health Duke Clinical & Translational Science Institute Duke-Margolis Institute for Health Policy Community & Global Health News & Media Give Get Care At Duke Back title Get access to the best care in North Carolina and beyond.

View all partners Email X (Twitter) Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger A current strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza, commonly known as bird flu, has become a global problem. The virus has affected many millions of birds, some other animal species, and a small number of people. Last week, the Australian government issued a warning to residents travelling to Europe, North America, South America and Asia about the risk of bird flu. The alert, published on the Smartraveller website, included advice to ensure your flu vaccine is up to date. If you are about to go travelling, this generally means if you’ve had a flu jab this year, although if it has been 3–6 months since your vaccine you should discuss this with your doctor. But the seasonal flu vaccine we get each year doesn’t actually prevent bird flu in humans. So why is it being recommended in this context? Some bird flu background Smartraveller notes several strains of bird flu are currently circulating. The most concerning strain, called the 2.3.4.4b clade, emerged a few years ago from a type of influenza A (H5, or A/H5) that has been circulating for several decades. Clade 2.3.4.4b primarily affects birds, including wild birds and poultry. It has had devastating effects on bird populations, as well as farmers and others involved in the poultry industry. In recent years, clade 2.3.4.4b has adapted to infect some mammals. Unfortunately it seems to cause severe disease in certain animals. Some marine mammals have been hit particularly hard, with mass mortality events reported in elephant seals and sea lions. In the United States, bird flu has also spread among dairy cows. Compared to the huge number of animal cases, there have been a relatively small number of humans infected with bird flu. Since 2003, 878 cases of A/H5N1 influenza have been reported in humans, with a small proportion of these reported since 2020 when clade 2.3.4.4b first emerged. The reported cases have been people who have had close contact with infected animals. It does not appear to spread from person to person. As such, the risk to travellers is low. There are some situations where the risk may be greater, such as for people visiting live markets, or those who are travelling specifically to work with wildlife or animals in food production. Infections in humans with H5 influenza can vary significantly in severity, from mild conjunctivitis up to fatal pneumonia. H5 influenza strains appear to be sensitive to antivirals (oseltamivir, also known as Tamiflu) and they are generally recommended as treatment for human infection, but it’s not clear whether they reduce the risk of death in those with severe disease. To date, one case of A/H5 influenza (not 2.3.4.4b) has been reported in Australia, in a child who had recently returned from overseas. While clade 2.3.4.4b has been detected in all continents except Australia, other avian influenza strains (A/H7) have been reported here earlier this year. There are many different strains of bird flu. Snowboy/Shutterstock Seasonal flu vaccines are not effective against bird flu Seasonal influenza refers to the flu strains that circulate each year. Since the COVID pandemic, three different strains have circulated in various proportions – influenza A H1N1 (descended from the 2009 swine flu strain), influenza A H3N2 (which has circulated since 1968) and an influenza B strain. Interestingly, a second influenza B strain (the Yamagata lineage) appears to have vanished during the COVID pandemic. Seasonal influenza vaccines contain up-to-date variants of these types (A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and B) that are recommended by the World Health Organization each year. They are moderately effective, reducing the risk of hospitalisation by about 40–60%. Influenza vaccines are quite specific in the protection that they provide. For seasonal vaccines, even the very small changes that occur in the virus from year to year are enough to allow them to “escape” vaccine-induced immunity. Therefore seasonal flu vaccines do not provide any protection against A/H5 influenza. Preventing a hybrid bird-human strain The rationale for recommending travellers have a flu shot in the context of the current bird flu outbreak is that seasonal flu vaccines may help reduce the risk of simultaneous infection with both A/H5 and a seasonal influenza strain. When this occurs, there is potential for a “recombination” of the genetic code from both viral strains. This could have the transmissibility of a seasonal human virus with the severity of an avian influenza virus. The 2009 swine flu strain arose from the recombination of several strains over years to become more transmissible in humans. Obviously a more effective vaccine would include a H5 strain, to generate immune responses specific to the H5 flu strain. Vaccine manufacturers have developed H5 vaccines over the years, but to date only Finland has deployed a H5 vaccine in a small group of people who work closely with potentially infected animals. Currently the level of risk posed by H5 to humans is not thought to be sufficient to require a specific vaccine program, as the potential benefits are small compared to the costs and the potential risks associated with any new vaccine program. The value of a flu shot for travellers Seasonal flu vaccines protect against influenza infection, and may also reduce the risk of simultaneous infection with human and bird flu strains. Bird flu aside, for most travellers who haven’t received a flu shot this year, reducing the risk of illness disrupting travel plans should be enough of a reason to get one. For those who have already received a flu shot this season, similar to COVID jabs, protection after vaccination appears to wane over time. So if you’re travelling to the northern hemisphere during the winter months, and it’s been more than 3–6 months since you received a flu vaccine, your doctor may recommend you have another. Bird flu is only a small risk to most travellers, but people may want to take sensible precautions, such as avoiding close contact with birds at markets.

The recommendations highlight two key updates: After more than a decade of quadrivalent formulations, this year’s flu shot is a trivalent vaccine that does not include an Influenza B/Yamagata component. The trivalent vaccine will target three flu strains: two influenza A viruses — H1N1 and H3N2 — and an influenza B/victoria virus. The B/Yamagata lineage has not been detected globally since March 2020, which suggests it may have been eliminated. Flu shots for adult solid organ transplant recipients ages 18–64 on immunosuppressive medications will include HD-IIV3 (trivalent high dose inactivated influenza vaccine) and allV3 (trivalent adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine). These high dose vaccines help boost immune response in older adults.Infectious disease experts say the optimal time to receive both the flu vaccine and updated COVID-19 vaccine is late September and during October. This gives both vaccines their best chance to protect during the winter months, according to William Schaffner, MD, professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases in the Department of Health Policy at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville.Healthline spoke with Schaffner to learn more about the upcoming flu season and why it’s important to get vaccinated against respiratory illnesses like influenza and COVID-19.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity and brevity.Why are flu shots trivalent this year?Schaffner: Flu vaccines in recent years have protected against four different strains of the influenza virus: two influenza A strains and two influenza B strains. We always do that because although there’s a dominant strain, numerous strains are usually circulating. This year, the influenza vaccine will protect against three strains because one of the B strains has disappeared from the world and has not been detected in two years, so there’s no need to include it in the vaccine anymore. That’s a good thing.How bad will the flu season be this year?Schaffner: We can all hope for a very mild influenza season, but it’s very hazardous to predict the severity of the upcoming flu season. It’s much easier after the flu season to go back and say how severe it was. We can look to the Southern Hemisphere — where they have their winter during our summer — but what happens there is not always predictive of what will happen here. We have included the strains that were active in the Southern Hemisphere this summer in our flu vaccine, and at the moment, it looks as though we have a very good match between what’s in our flu vaccine and what we anticipate the dominant strains will be.Can you get your flu shot and COVID shot at the same time? Schaffner: Yes, you have to get both shots, whether in the same arm or the other arm, because the flu vaccine won’t protect against COVID-19, and the COVID vaccine will not protect against the flu. The recommendations for both vaccines are identical (6 months and older). Both of these vaccines are very important — and that goes for anyone who’s eligible.Are you concerned about vaccine hesitancy as students return to school?Schaffner: I’m always concerned about that because familiarity breeds, if not contempt, a certain nonchalance, and so we have come to accept and live with the annual influenza virus outbreaks.Those of us in infectious diseases and public health take flu very seriously because we know that this nasty family of viruses can take a normal, healthy young person and put them in the emergency room in the hospital. Within 48 hours, every major hospital in the country sees this sort of thing happening every year. Yes, most flu in children is mild, and they get over it very easily. But on occasion, a normal, healthy child can be made morbidly, gravely ill. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) agree 100% with the CDC that children should be vaccinated, and that goes along with adolescents and young and middle-aged adults. Why is it important for people to receive the flu vaccine?Schaffner: Getting vaccinated against the flu is the most comfortable and reassuring thing you can do to protect yourself against severe disease, but you also protect your family and your community.Older persons, frail persons, people with underlying chronic medical conditions, and people who are immunocompromised are at the greatest risk for severe disease from the flu. The flu vaccine is best at preventing severe disease and has some impact on reducing transmission. So if you get the flu vaccine, you will provide some modicum of protection to those around you.For those who are immune compromised who can’t respond to the vaccine very well because their immune system doesn’t work as well, the best way we can protect them is for everybody else around them to be protected, providing a kind of a cocoon of protection for those who are among the most fragile in our communities. TakeawayThe CDC’s recommendations for the 2024–25 flu season include two key updates: a return to trivalent flu shots and high dose vaccines for adults receiving organ transplants.To protect themselves during the winter months, everyone ages 6 months and older should get their flu and COVID shots, ideally at the same time and before the end of October.Getting vaccinated against the flu and COVID-19 helps prevent severe illness, even in young, healthy individuals.

To enhance comprehension of the source of infection and risk factors of the H10N3 virus infection, this case report summarizes the clinical features, epidemiological investigation, and laboratory test results. Provides recommendations for the prevention and control of Human infection with avian influenza H10N3.Case presentationA 51-year-old male with a history of COVID-19 infection and a smoking habit of 30 years, worked in livestock breeding and was exposed to sick and dead poultry before falling ill with fever and chills on 28th February 2024. A week later, he was diagnosed with severe pneumonia, influenza, and respiratory failure by the Third People's Hospital of Kunming(KM-TPH). He was discharged on 17th April and none of his 6 close contacts showed any symptoms of illness. Environmental samples taken from the epidemic spot revealed that peacock feces tested positive for avian influenza sub-type H9 and waterfowl specimens showed positive results for avian influenza sub-type H5. Gene sequencing conducted on positive specimens from the patient's respiratory tract by the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDC) showed a high degree of similarity (98.6–99.5%) with the strain responsible for the second global case of human infected with H10N3 (reported from Zhejiang, China 2022).ConclusionsAccording to the available epidemiological information, there is limited evidence to suggest that H10N3 viruses are excessively lethal. However, adaptive site mutations have been observed in the H10N3 isoform of mammals. While it is unlikely that the H10N3 virus will spread among humans, the possibility of additional cases cannot be entirely ruled out. Symptoms of human infection with H10N3 avian influenza are similar to those of common respiratory infections, which may result in them being overlooked during initial clinical consultations. Therefore, it is essential to improve surveillance of the H10 sub-type of avian influenza and to increase the awareness of hospital-related workers of cases of pneumonia of unknown origin. Peer Review reports IntroductionAvian influenza virus sub-type H10 was first isolated from poultry in 1949 (A/Chicken/Germany/N/1949 [H10N7]) [1].The first human case of avian influenza H10N3 was reported in Jiangsu Province, China in April 2021 [2, 3]. As of the latest WHO weekly report on avian influenza surveillance until March 8th 2024, only two human cases of avian influenza sub-type H10N3 have been reported globally, both in China [4]. This has become a public health concern worldwide [5,6,7]. In March 2024, a third case of avian influenza H10N3 was reported in Kunming, Yunnan Province, China. This was the first case of avian influenza H10N3 in a patient with a history of COVID-19 infection. This report provides a comprehensive description of the clinical presentation, epidemiological investigation, and laboratory testing to improve our interpretation of the pathogenesis, high-risk exposures, and control policy recommendations associated with human-infected H10N3 virus.Case presentationThe case under consideration in this report is a 51-year-old male (BMI 25.35) working in commercial services and livestock breeding in the Kunming, Yunnan province, China. He had a history of COVID19 infection (self-test for SARS-CoV-2 antigen), and he was a smoker with 30-year history. There was no previous history of infectious or chronic diseases, food or drug allergies or blood transfusions. He had a history of exposure to sick and dead poultry within prior to the onset of illness.Clinical historyOn 28th February 2024, the patient experienced clinical symptoms of fever and chills.he self-medicated with ibuprofen, the symptoms did not subside (Fig. 1). From 1st March to 5th March, the patient's condition deteriorated, exhibiting symptoms of influenza-like illness (recurrent high fever, maximum temperature of 39 °C, chills, cough, and shortness of breath). The patient received infusion treatment multiple times at the clinic and the Community Health Service Centre (CHSC) near his residence (the detail was unknown), but his condition did not improve. On 5th March, the patient's chest X-ray at the CHSC revealed an infection in the lower lobe of the right lung. The patient was diagnosed at the Respiratory Department of the KM-TPH on 6 March with (1) severe pneumonia; (2) type I respiratory failure; (3) influenza; (4) hepatic insufficiency; (5) hypercoagulable state; and (6) renal insufficiency(Additional file 1: Table 1). The chest CT scan showed the presence of an infection(Fig. 2). On 7th March, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to significant wheezing(PCO2 32 mmHg, PO2 34 mmHg, and SPO2 66%). Between 7 and 15th March, the ICU provided non-invasive ventilator to improve his respiratory functioning(mode S/T, f18 beats/min, IPAP 14 cmH20, EPAP 10 cmH20, Fi02 95%)while administering drugs to control the infection (Omadacycline, Mefenamic acid, Marbofloxacin, and Oseltamivir). On 17th March, the patient's oxygen saturation dropped to 65–75% due to non-cooperation with the non-invasive ventilator. ICU performed orotracheal intubation to improve his respiratory function.Fig. 1Timeline of the patient's progression for breeding animal, exposure and treatment historyFull size imageFig. 2Chest CT in this case of a 51-year-old man with H10N3: Multiple patches and flaky shadows in both lungs, slight thickening of the pleura bilaterally, and a small amount of pleural effusionFull size imageThe patient was discharged on 17 April at and was recommended to receive continuous home oxygen therapy and regular follow-up after discharge.Additional file 1: Table 1 Clinical characteristics of the H10N3 patient(see supplement, P 26).Field epidemiology investigationHistory of suspected exposure and contactThe patient's history of suspected exposure and contact was investigated retrospectively. It was found that the patient followed a consistent and uniform weekday routine without any recent travel abroad. Additionally, the patient had not come into contact with anyone who had respiratory symptoms before experiencing symptoms. Since January 2023, the patient has been farming livestock including chickens, ducks, geese, peacocks, and goats within a particular area. All of the poultry and livestock that the patient raises are purchased from local markets.The patient is primarily responsible for the upkeep of the farm as well as any sales of animals, he visits once a day to feed the animals. From mid-February to 29th February, there were reported illnesses and deaths among the farmed animals, with approximately 10 chickens, 5 geese, and 5 sheep dying(Table 1). During the period, patients were fed animals and disposed livestock faeces, as well as dead poultry on the farm, without the use of any personal protective equipment (PPE). His family members later stated that the dead poultry and animals had been disposed of by the patient. Though no carcasses were discovered during our epidemiological investigation. Table 1 Changes in the type and number of animals kept by patientsFull size tableEpidemic spot investigationThe epidemic spot is a wasteland located southwest of the Panlong District of Kunming (KM-PL). The site is located next to the local forest fire prevention station (FFPS) to the west (Fig. 2). To the south, about 10 m away, there is a residential area (RA). The East Baisha River Reservoir (BRR) in Kunming is located approximately 1.5 km southeast. This area is around 1,000 square meters and is open-air. The hygiene conditions in the area are inadequate, with livestock excreta contaminating livestock troughs and personnel areas. The farming pattern in the epidemic spot was mixed captive and free-range farming with no clear regional division. This shows the phenomenon of co-habitation and co-existence of humans, animals, and poultry (Fig. 3).Fig. 3Epidemic spot investigation diagram:UR is used for egg incubation, young bird rearing, feed processing, and Pharmaceutical Storage and Configure. SB-2 serves as a night time penning area for livestock and poultryFull size imageIdentification and Tracing of close contactsAccording to the Technical Guidelines for the Prevention and Control of Influenza of Human Infection of Animal Origin, person who had direct contact with a patient between February 28th and March 5th 2024 without using any PPE is considered a close contact. In this case, there were a total of 6 close contacts identified for daily monitoring, including 4 family members (3 of whom lived with the patient and 1 who accompanied the patient to the clinic) and 2 management farm workers employed by the patient. None of these individuals had shown any symptoms related to H10N3 or any other respiratory illness within the 10 days following their last exposure to the patient.Laboratory testingOn 15th March, TPH submitted a sputum specimen from the patient to KMCDC for testing. The results showed that the patient was positive for influenza A virus sub-type nucleic acid and sub-typing identified influenza virus A (H10N3) sub-type nucleic acid. On the same day, the Yunnan Provincial Disease Control (YNCDC) reviewed the specimen and confirmed the test results. The CCDC gene sequencing results from March 25th indicate that the specimen from this case has a high sequence homology of 98.6–99.5% with the human-infected avian influenza H10N3 sub-type virus that was reported in Zhejiang Province in 2022. The virus may have dual receptor binding since the amino acids 226–228 at the HA (Hemagglutinin) receptor binding site are L/RSG. The amino acid 701 of the PB-2 protein is N, indicating a mutation that is adaptive to mammals. No resistance mutations associated with neuraminidase inhibitor analogues and polymerase inhibitor analogues were detected in the genetic sequences obtained from the patients. Suggests sensitivity to neuraminidase inhibitors (e.g. Oseltamivir) and polymerase inhibitors (e.g. Baloxavir).The six internal genes identified in the specimens originated from the H9N2 virus.Nucleic acid tests were conducted twice by the KMCDC on samples from the six close contacts. No influenza A virus was identified. GenBank accession numbers of HA and PB-2 are as follows: HA (PP555669), PB-2(PP555666).On 16th March, the PLCDC collected the samples from breeding sites, including poultry, livestock, and eggs (Table 2). The KMCDC has detected positive nucleic acid for avian influenza virus A (H9 sub-type) in peacock fecal samples. The Animal Disease Prevention and Control (ADPC)collected 23 biological samples from animals at the exposure site. Among these, three waterfowl anal samples tested positive for influenza virus A (H5 sub-type) nucleic acid, while the remaining samples tested negative. Table 2 Results of environmental and animal specimen samplingFull size tableConclusionOur report meticulously describes the first case of human-infected avian influenza H10N3 virus since the end of the COVID-19 pandemic. Similar to the onset of the first two globally reported cases [5, 8], human infection with the H10N3 virus initially presents with common symptoms of respiratory disease, such as fever, cough, shortness of breath, and fatigue. These symptoms could be easily overlooked, leading to delayed treatment. The three reported cases worldwide were all caused by delayed treatment in the early stages of the disease, resulting in severe pneumonia, systemic infection, and respiratory failure a week later. The initial two reported H10N3 cases(reported in Jiangsu and Zhejiang) were discharged from the hospital after approximately one month of treatment. However, in this case, the patient was hospitalized for over a month before his infection was initially controlled. Although the inflammation in the lungs had subsided, the patient still required ventilator assistance. It is possibly related to the fact that the patient's exposure history of COVID-19 and prolonged smoking increased the rate of respiratory viruses or even aggravated the severity of the influenza host infection [9, 10]. Moreover, the evidence available could not confirm that the H10N3 virus is more pathogenic compared to other highly pathogenic sub-types of avian influenza. Resistance testing suggests that neuraminidase inhibitors (e.g., oseltamivir) and polymerase inhibitors (e.g. baloxavir) may be used to treat H10N3 virus infection.This case report was preceded by a clear history of exposure to sick and dead poultry, as well as prolonged exposure to mixed farming. The proximity of case-exposed epidemic spot to BRR may increase the risk of cross-infection between different species of poultry and wildfowl. Research by Wang and Zhang et al. showed that inter-population transmission of avian influenza sub-type H10 and other human-infected avian influenza sub-types occurs through the alteration of a certain gene segment after poultry infection by wild birds carrying the virus, particularly wild waterfowl. This alteration increases the affinity of avian influenza viruses to bind to human receptors [11,12,13]. Dai et al. also found genetic mutations in this case may increasing the likelihood of human infection avian influenza [14]. Furthermore, the H10N3 sub-type avian influenza virus is a recombinant virus with surface genes derived from the H7 and H9 sub-types of viruses circulating in chickens and ducks [12]. This is despite the limitations of the report, as no poultry carcasses were found and no environmental samples positive for the H10 sub-type were identified. Based on the available epidemiological investigations and genetic sequencing results, the mixed farming pattern of the epidemic spot and the detection of avian influenza viruses (sub-types H5 and H9) in different animals suggests that this is an environment of elevated risk of human exposure to avian influenza viruses including H10N3. Currently, none of the close contacts of the three reported human cases of H10N3 infection worldwide have exhibited clinical symptoms related to avian influenza or tested positive for the H10N3 virus. The H10N3 virus has not acquired the ability for sustained human-to-human transmission, therefore the probability of transmission among humans is currently low [7].This reported case in Kunming is over 2,000 km away from the locations of the first two cases of homozygosity in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. It could be inferred that avian influenza H10 sub-type viruses have been spreading for a longer period within Yunnan Province even in the wider avian population. Further cases of human-infected H10N3 avian influenza may be reported locally or in other regions of the world. Thus, in terms of the current state of global prevalence. Enhanced surveillance of H10 sub-type viruses in avian influenza-prone areas worldwide is necessary. It's particularly important to reviewed test nucleic acid-positive specimens of excluded seasonal influenza viruses (H1N1, H3N2, B Victoria, B Yamagata) to prevent the spread of this virus.To reduce the risk of human infection with various animal-borne diseases due to lack of formal regulation and health education. We recommend the following based on this report: (1) The departments of agriculture and rural areas should enhance the regulation and approval process for privately contracted land used for breeding farms. Government agencies should thoroughly review and document the use of contracted land under their jurisdiction. (2) ADPC should improve surveillance and risk identification of animal diseases in live poultry trading markets and private breeding sites. In addition, it is highly recommended that health education be provided to high-risk groups. (3) Clinical staff are advised to improve their sensitivity in the diagnosis and recognition of avian influenza. The focus should be on individuals who have a history of respiratory infectious diseases and smoking. Clinical diagnosis needs to be combined with epidemiological information on the case. (4) The diagnosis must be promptly reported to the CDC for investigation and disposition to interrupt the spread of the disease early.

Experimental subunit vaccines based on the conserved ectodomain of the matrix protein 2 (M2e) induce cross-reactive antibody responses, but fail to fully prevent virus shedding after low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) virus challenge, and are ineffective against highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses. This study assessed the benefits of combining nanoparticles bearing three tandem M2e repeats (NR-3M2e nanorings or NF-3M2e nanofilaments) with an HA1 subunit vaccine in protecting chickens against a heterologous HPAI H5N1 virus challenge. Chickens vaccinated with the combined formulations developed M2e and HA1-specific antibodies, were fully protected from clinical disease and mortality, and showed no histopathological lesions or virus shedding, unlike those given only HA1, NR-3M2e, or NF-3M2e. Thus, the combined vaccine formulations provided complete cross-protection against HPAI H5N1 virus, and prevented environmental virus shedding, crucial for controlling avian influenza outbreaks.

IAV are divided into subtypes based on two proteins on the surface of the virus: hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). There are 18 different HA subtypes and 11 different NA subtypes (H1 through H18 and N1 through N11, respectively). H17N10 and H18N11 are restricted to bats. Generally, avian IAV are classified into low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) or high pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses on the basis of their pathobiological effects in gallinaceous species2. In chickens, infections with LPAI viruses are usually asymptomatic or cause low to mild clinical signs associated with viral replication in the respiratory, digestive, and/or reproductive systems2. Nevertheless, in the case of comorbidities, clinical signs and lesions can be more prominent in affected birds. In addition, some Asian LPAI H9N2 viruses can cause more severe clinical symptoms and even mortality in chickens2. HPAI viruses replicate in multiple tissues leading to systemic disease with damages in multiple visceral organs, nervous and cardiovascular systems causing high morbidity and mortality2. HPAI H5 viruses derived from the Gs/GD lineage, which has evolved worldwide into diverse clades, subclades and reassortant viruses (“H5Nx viruses”), cause important economic losses to the poultry industry. In addition, they are considered as a serious threat to public health worldwide through their zoonotic and pandemic potential.Vaccination, when implemented with good farm biosecurity measures, can be an effective approach to control IAV infections in poultry and to reduce the economic impacts. Although vaccination of poultry against IAV varies between countries, licensed vaccines include whole inactivated viruses (WIV) emulsified in oil adjuvants and live recombinant viral vectors with HA-encoding gene inserts3. These vaccines generate variable levels of neutralizing antibodies directed towards the globular head domain of HA (HA1), which can prevent viral entry into permissive host cells and subsequent virus replication. While antigenic mismatch between vaccine strains and circulating IAV reduces vaccine efficacy, antigenically updated vaccines can provide improved protection against the clinical disease and virus shedding3,4,5,6,7,8,9. However, antigenic drift resulting from mutations, mainly in the HA gene and virus reassortment events that occur periodically in circulating IAV have a deleterious impact on vaccine efficacy in the field3.Owing to the high genetic and antigenic variability of IAV, current research focuses on developing subunit vaccines which contain “universal” viral antigens, including a conserved sequence located in the ectodomain of the matrix protein 2 (M2), termed M2e10. M2 protein is sparsely expressed at the surface of the virus, but is abundant on the surface of IAV-infected cells. The protection conferred by M2e-based vaccines is associated with the production of M2e-specific antibodies that can eliminate infected cells mainly through Fc-mediated effector mechanisms, although M2e-specific T-cell responses may also contribute to eliminating virus-infected cells10. While vaccination trials in mouse or ferret models have demonstrated that M2e is a promising antigen candidate for inducing broad protection against a range of IAV, M2e-based vaccines were not protective in pigs11,12,13, and results in chickens were lukewarm so far10,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32. Vaccine formulations incorporating single14,28,32 or multiple15,16,17,18,19,20,22,23,29,30,31,32 M2e antigens alone or combined with other conserved epitopes, such as those located in the stalk domain of HA (HA2)28,29, were unable to protect chickens against mortality associated with HPAI viruses28,29,30,31, nor to prevent virus shedding upon experimental infections with LPAI14,15,16,17,18,19,20,22,23 or HPAI28,29,30,31,32 viruses. While subunit vaccines based solely on M2e did not provide complete protection against IAV, two recent studies indicated that the supplementation of H5N1 WIV vaccines with M2e conferred clinical protection and impeded virus shedding after heterologous HPAI H5 virus infection in chickens31,33. Nonetheless, the WIV and challenge virus strains used in these studies belonged to the same second-order clade. Moreover, the ability of these supplemented vaccines to prevent virus replication in different organs was not demonstrated in any of these studies.We previously developed two innovative nanostructures with inherent immune adjuvant property, namely nanorings (NRs) and nanofilaments (NFs), that showed high efficiency as vaccine delivery platforms for the M2e antigen in mice. NRs are composed of recombinant nucleoprotein (N) of the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which self-assembles into homogenous rings of about 15 nm in diameter when expressed in Escherichia coli (E. coli)34,35,36. NFs, on the other hand, are composed of recombinant curli-specific gene A (CsgA) protein, a major extracellular matrix component contributing to biofilm formation in numerous enteric bacteria37. Recombinant CsgA monomers produced in E. coli spontaneously self-assemble in vitro into cross-β-sheet quaternary structures forming long and unbranched fibrils with diameter ranging from 5 to 15 nm and length that can reach over 1 µm38,39. Thus, recombinant chimeric NRs and NFs were produced as vaccines against IAV by fusing three tandem repeats of the M2e peptide (3M2e) at the C-terminal end of the N sequence of RSV (NR-3M2e), and by linking the N-terminal domain of CsgA with 3M2e (NF-3M2e), respectively. Mice immunized with NR-3M2e or NF-3M2e developed potent M2e-specific humoral and cellular immune responses and survived a homologous H1N1 IAV challenge34,40,41. The efficacy of NR-3M2e and NF-3M2e in anti-IAV vaccination in chickens has not been demonstrated yet. In addition, the ability of enhancing the cross-protective potential of subunit vaccines by combining HA1 and M2e remains unexplored in chickens. In this study, we evaluated the benefit of supplementing NR-3M2e or NF-3M2e with an HA1 subunit vaccine against a genetically divergent HPAI H5N1 virus challenge in specific pathogen-free (SPF) chickens.ResultsBiochemical and structural characterization of NR-3M2e and NF-3M2eIn this study, we evaluated the effect of the supplementation of nanoparticles incorporating M2e antigens with an HA1 subunit vaccine in the cross-protection against HPAI H5N1 virus challenge in chickens. To this end, chimeric NR-3M2e and NF-3M2e were produced and their (supra)structural characteristics were validated. The purified NR-3M2e and NF-3M2e preparations appeared as a single band at the predicted molecular weight by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie blue staining (Fig. 1A, D). Western blotting using specific antibodies validated the identity and antigenicity of preparation (Fig. 1B, E). NR-3M2e exhibited ring-like morphological features by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. 1C), and dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis indicated that the preparation was mainly composed of a homogenous population with a hydrodynamic radius of around 20 nm (Supplementary Fig. 1).Fig. 1: Biochemical and biophysical properties of NR-3M2e and NF-3M2e.Recombinant NR-3M2e were produced and purified as described in “Methods” section, and then analyzed by (A) SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie blue staining, (B) Western blot assays with (B, left panel) N-specific polyclonal antibodies and (B, right panel) M2-specific monoclonal antibody, and (C) transmission electron microscopy after negative staining. Recombinant NF-3M2e were produced and purified as described in “Methods” section, and then analyzed by (D) SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie blue staining and (E) Western blot assays with M2-specific monoclonal antibody, and (F) transmission electron microscopy after negative staining.Full size imageThe self-assembly and morphology of purified NF-3M2e were confirmed by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy and TEM. CD indicated that NF-3M2e displayed a characteristic minimum at ~218 nm and maximum at ~197 nm, corresponding to a β-sheet-rich secondary structure (Supplementary Fig. 2)42. Thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence further confirmed the presence of the cross-β-sheet quaternary structure, whereas 8-anilino-1- naphthalenesulfonic acid (ANS) revealed the formation of accessible hydrophobic pockets upon nanofilament formation (Supplementary Fig. 2C). TEM (Fig. 1F) analyses of NF-3M2e revealed the formation of a dense network of fibrillar assemblies with widths in the order of 2.5–5 nm. These observations supported the typical morphological heterogeneities of CsgA, in accordance with previous studies39,43,44,45.The co-administration of NR-3M2e or NF-3M2e with HA1 protein triggered M2e-and HA1-specific antibody responses in chickensFirstly, we evaluated the immunogenicity of our vaccine formulations. Chickens received three intramuscular administrations, at 2-week intervals, of NR-3M2e or NF-3M2e admixed with HA1 protein, or each single component alone. Vaccine antigens were emulsified with Emulsigen®-P, an oil-in-water adjuvant used in veterinary vaccination46. The HA1-specific antibody responses were assessed by an hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay (Fig. 2) and competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Fig. 3A). Chickens immunized with HA1 protein exhibited significant HI titers as soon as day 28 post-primary vaccination in comparison with non-vaccinated chickens, and the highest titers were observed after the second boost (Fig. 2). A high intragroup variability was observed, and the administration of a second boost was necessary to maximize the number of seroconverted chickens (1/15 and 11/15 chickens presenting HI titers ≥ 16 at day 28 and day 42 post-primary vaccination, respectively). Chickens immunized with NR-3M2e or NF-3M2e admixed with HA1 exhibited significant HI titers after the second boost in comparison with non-vaccinated chickens, with a high intragroup variability (6/15 and 10/14 chickens presenting HI titers ≥ 16 at day 42 post-primary vaccination with [NR-3M2e + HA1] and [NF-3M2e + HA1], respectively). The co-administration of NF-3M2e with HA1 did not have a major impact on HI titers in comparison with the administration of HA1 protein alone (Fig. 2). By contrast, chickens co-immunized with NR-3M2e and HA1 exhibited lower HI titers in comparison with chickens immunized with HA1 alone, even after the second boost. The competitive ELISA confirmed that chickens immunized with HA1, [NR-3M2e + HA1] or [NF-3M2e + HA1] developed significant HA1-specific antibody responses at day 42 post-primary vaccination (Fig. 3A). Chickens immunized with NR-3M2e or NF-3M2e administered alone or in combination with HA1 developed significant M2e-specific IgG at day 42 post-primary vaccination, and there was no difference in the magnitude of the response whether HA1 was incorporated in the formulation or not (Fig. 3B). In conclusion, chickens immunized with HA1 protein in combination with NR-3M2e or NF-3M2e developed significant HA1- and M2e-specific antibody responses, and the co-administration of the two IAV antigens did not notably hinder the induction of the response directed against each of the antigens.Fig. 2: Serum hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers of chickens immunized with HA1 protein administered alone or in combination with NR-3M2e or NF-3M2e.Chickens received at 2-week intervals three intramuscular administrations of HA1 protein in combination with NR-3M2e or NF-3M2e, or each single component alone.

The challenge virus belonged to clade 2.3.4.4c, whose HA gene was derived from the Eurasian Gs/GD-like H5N1 lineage47. The HA1 vaccine protein was derived from a North American lineage LPAI H5N1 virus, and shared only 81% identity in amino acid sequence with the HA1 sequence of the challenge virus, allowing to evaluate the broad-protective potential of our vaccine formulations. Unvaccinated chickens (PBS group) and chickens immunized with NR-3M2e or NF-3M2e started to die from 2 to 3 dpc, with 100% mortality by 4 dpc (NF-3M2e and NR-3M2e) or 7 dpc (unvaccinated). Thirty-three percent of chickens (5/15) immunized with HA1 protein survived the challenge by 21 dpc, and no clinical signs were observed in the surviving chickens. Finally, all chickens immunized with HA1 protein in combination with NR-3M2e or NF-3M2e survived the infection, with no protracted clinical signs (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 1). The virus was detected in the oropharyngeal (Fig. 5A) and/or cloacal (Fig. 5B) swabs of all unvaccinated chickens, and in chickens immunized with NR-3M2e or NF-3M2e. Viral RNA was detected in the swabs of all dead chickens and all surviving chickens with the exception of three surviving chickens in the HA1 group (Supplementary Table 1). In sharp contrast, no viral RNA was detected in both cloacal and oropharyngeal swabs of birds immunized with [NR-3M2e + HA1] or [NF-3M2e + HA1] during the course of the experiment (Fig. 5A, B). Thus, the supplementation of NR-3M2e or NF-3M2e with HA1 protein was essential to completely prevent chickens from clinical disease, mortality, and virus shedding after a challenge with heterologous H5N1 virus.Fig. 4: Clinical protection in chickens immunized with NR-3M2e or NF-3M2e supplemented with HA1, or each component alone, after infection with heterologous HPAI H5N1 virus.Chickens received at 2-week intervals three intramuscular administrations of HA1 protein in combination with NF-3M2e or NR-3M2e, or each single component alone. Chickens receiving PBS were included as a control group. All preparations were admixed with Emulsigen®-P. Two weeks after the third immunization, all chickens were challenged with 2.3 × 102 PFU of heterologous HPAI H5N1 virus and monitored daily for mortality. The survival curves of infected chickens are expressed as the percentages of surviving chickens. The log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test was used to compare survival curves. *statistically significant difference (P < 0.05) in comparison to PBS group. ¤statistically significant difference (P < 0.05) between the indicated groups.Full size imageFig. 5: Virological protection in chickens immunized with NR-3M2e or NF-3M2e supplemented with HA1, or each component alone, after infection with heterologous HPAI H5N1 virus.Chickens received at 2-week intervals three intramuscular administrations of HA1 protein in combination with NF-3M2e or NR-3M2e, or each single component alone.

Infections with HPAI H5N1 viruses usually result in moderate pulmonary lesions in chickens48. However, in this study, chickens in the PBS group exhibited obvious lung lesions, consisting of necrosis and hypercellularity (Fig. 6A). Mild increase in cellularity due to inflammatory cell infiltration was observed in the NR-3M2e (Fig. 6C) and NF-3M2e (Fig. 6E) groups. By contrast, no prominent lung lesion was noticeable in the HA1 (Fig. 6G), [NR-3M2e + HA1] (Fig. 6I) or [NF-3M2e + HA1] (Fig. 6K) groups. IAV antigen was extensively detected in scattered alveolar macrophages and necrotic focus in the PBS group, and in fewer endothelial cells and alveolar macrophages in the HA1 group (Fig. 6B, H). While staining for virus antigen was extensive and involved large number of alveolar macrophages in the lungs of chickens vaccinated with NR-3M2e (Fig. 6D), scanty and few viral antigen-laden macrophages appeared in the NF-3M2e group (Fig. 6F). No virus antigen was visible in the lungs of chickens immunized with either NR-3M2e or NF-3M2e supplemented with HA1 (Fig. 6J, L).Fig. 6: Histological and immunohistochemical analyses of lung tissues.Chickens received at 2-week intervals three intramuscular administrations of NR-3M2e or NF-3M2e in combination with HA1 protein, or each single component alone. Chickens receiving PBS were included as a control group. All preparations were admixed with Emulsigen®-P. Two weeks after the third immunization, all chickens were challenged with 2.3 × 102 PFU of heterologous HPAI H5N1 virus. Lungs were collected at selected days post-challenge (dpc), and sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) before histological analyis (left panels), or stained with anti-NP antibody before immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis (right panels).

By contrast, no microscopic brain lesion was observed in the group immunized with [NR-3M2e + HA1] (Fig. 7I). Although the extent of the virus antigen load varied between the groups, the virus was detected in the brain of the PBS (Fig. 7B), NR-3M2e (Fig. 7D), NF-3M2e (Fig. 7F), and HA1 (Fig. 7H) groups. No viral antigen was detected in the [NR-3M2e + HA1] group (Fig. 7J). Finally, whereas necrotic foci were observed in the heart tissue of chickens immunized with HA1 (Fig. 8G), no cardiac lesion was detected in the PBS group (Fig. 8A) or in chickens immunized with the M2e-based nanoparticles administered alone (Fig. 8C, E) or in combination with HA1 (Fig. 8I, K). Remarkable amounts of virus antigen were detected in the cardiac fibers in all groups of chickens (Fig. 8B, D, F, H) with the exception of chickens immunized with the supplemented vaccine formulations, which did not harbor any traces of virus antigen in the cardiac tissue (Fig. 8J, L). To conclude, the supplementation of NR-3M2e or NF-3M2e with HA1 protein prevented virus replication and subsequent pathological alterations in chicken lung, brain, and heart tissues after infection with a heterologous HPAI H5N1 virus.Fig. 7: Histological and immunohistochemical analyses of brain tissues.Chickens received at 2-week intervals three intramuscular administrations of NR-3M2e or NF-3M2e in combination with HA1 protein, or each single component alone.

Besides, traditional WIV vaccines are produced in embryonated chicken eggs, a technology that is time-consuming and requires a large supply of SPF eggs3. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of vaccine formulations incorporating the conserved M2e peptide and HA1 protein against an experimental challenge in chickens with HPAI H5N1 virus. The vaccine HA1 gene was derived from a strain antigenically divergent from the challenge strain.M2e is an attractive vaccine candidate because its amino acid sequence is highly conserved among IAV49. Since M2e peptide is poorly immunogenic per se, several approaches have been developed to increase its immunogenicity, including its fusion to adjuvant sequences14,17,28,29,30, and its expression within nanoparticles16,18,22,31,50,51. In this study, we grafted M2e antigen to NRs and NFs, two nanoplatforms with inherent adjuvant activity. NRs are composed of 10-11 NRSV protomers entrapping random single-stranded bacterial RNA fragments of 70 to 77 bases35. Previous in vitro experiments using NRs fused to the green-fluorescent-protein (GFP) demonstrated that NRs were rapidly captured by mouse antigen-presenting cells (APCs) (including macrophage and dendritic cell lines), and the punctuated fluorescence observed by confocal microscopy suggested that internalized NRs were located in endosomal compartments52. NRs stimulated the expression of co-stimulatory molecule CD86 and the secretion of type I IFNs by mouse APCs in a MyD88-dependent pathway (Riffault S, unpublished results). Both the organized structure of NRs and encapsidated RNA fragments, which are natural ligands for pattern-recognition receptors such as Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7/8, may be involved in the immunostimulatory properties of NRs (Riffault S, unpublished results). Previous studies in mice demonstrated the genetic linking of H1N1 M2e or HA2 proteins to NRs increased the immunogenicity and protective potential of the antigens against a homologous H1N1 challenge34,40. On the other hand, CsgA fibrils engage the membrane heterodimeric TLR1/TLR2 and the cytosolic inflammasome NOD-like receptor pyrin 3 (NLRP3), inducing the activation and maturation of APCs and the production of IL-1β and IL-6 pro-inflammatory cytokines that are important for adaptative immune responses41,53. The present study demonstrated that chickens immunized with NF-3M2e or NR-3M2e exhibited robust M2e-specific antibody responses, and that NRs and NFs are effective scaffolds for the delivery of IAV antigens in vivo.Although chickens vaccinated with HA1 protein developed significant levels of specific antibodies, almost 70% of the chickens died after the heterologous H5N1 virus challenge by the end of the experimental period of 21 days. Moreover, viral RNA was detected in the oropharynx and cloaca of two surviving chickens through the 14 day-sampling period. This result is in agreement with other studies where experimental H5 HA subunit vaccines, such as baculovirus-expressed HA54, virus-like particles (VLP) displaying HA antigens55, or commercial viral vector vaccines expressing HA56,57,58 alone, failed to confer full protection or to prevent virus shedding after challenge with HPAI H5 virus whose HA sequence shared less than 90% identity with the vaccine HA. Notably, the percentage of HA homology between the vaccine and challenge strain is not always an adequate indicator for protection, and key amino acids can dictate the protection offered by HA-based vaccines. Indeed, several studies reported that chickens vaccinated with H5 HA subunit vaccines were not completely protected from clinical disease and/or virus shedding after infection with HPAI H5 viruses whose HA sequence shared ≥ 98% identity with the vaccine sequence, or whose HA belonged to the same (sub)clade as the vaccine HA59,60,61,62,63,64,65. A multitude of other experimental factors could also influence the efficacy of HA subunit vaccines, including the vaccine dose59,66,67,68,69, the adjuvant used59,66,70,71,72,73,74, the route of vaccination75,76, the number67,68,77,78 of vaccine doses, the challenge virus dose79, the time interval between vaccination and challenge80, and the age of chickens68.In this study, all chickens vaccinated with NR-3M2e or NF-3M2e died within 4 dpc, and substantial amounts of viral RNA was detected in the oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs, implying the lack of protection when the nanovaccines were used as standalone vaccines. The lack of protection observed for these vaccine groups correlated with the appearance of histological lesions and the detection of virus antigen in the lung, brain, and heart tissues. It is noteworthy that several M2e-based subunit vaccines have been tested in chickens against HPAI viruses25,28,30,31,32. Although these studies associated M2e peptides with various adjuvants or delivery systems, and used multiple immunization regimens to increase the immune response to M2e, strategies targeting M2e alone showed no or limited efficacy25,28,30,31,32. Compared to anti-HA antibodies that interfere with the binding of IAV to sialic acid receptors present on the surface of infected epithelial cells and block viral entry, anti-M2e antibodies do not exert neutralizing activity against the virus but, instead, can eliminate virus-infected cells via antibody-dependent cell-mediated and complement-dependent cytotoxicity mechanisms81,82,83. Thus, M2e-based vaccines do not confer sterilizing immunity, but rather alleviate or suppress the symptoms of the disease by reducing the viral spread. Although some reports indicated that M2e vaccines suppressed clinical signs23 or prevented lung lesions23 after LPAI virus challenge, these vaccines were inefficient to protect chickens against HPAI virus infections25,28,30,31,32.In contrast to chickens immunized with HA1 protein or M2e nanovaccines alone, chickens vaccinated with formulations that combined HA1 and each of the nanovaccines ([NF-3M2e + HA1] or [NR-3M2e + HA1]) survived the challenge. Remarkably, they did not exhibit any outward clinical signs, tissue pathology or virus shedding. Different vaccine strategies combining IAV antigens have been explored in attempts to broaden the protection against HPAI viruses in chickens. For example, VLP incorporating multiple HA derived from various subtypes or H5 clades protected chickens against clinical disease after heterologous challenge with H5N2 and H7N3 viruses55, or H5N1 and H5N8 viruses61, respectively. Nonetheless, in all these studies, viral excretion was not completely suppressed55,61. Another strategy based on viral vectors co-expressing H5 HA protein and conserved IAV antigens such as NA84 or nucleoprotein (NP)85 did not improve the cross-protection against H5 viruses in comparison with the viral vectors expressing HA alone. Actually, only formulations consisting of H5N1 WIV admixed with M2e, either incorporated within VLP or expressed by recombinant baculovirus, abolished both clinical disease and virus shedding after challenge with HPAI virus belonging to the same second-order subclade as the WIV strain (clade 2.3)31,33. New subclades are designated when the average percentage pairwise nucleotide distances exceed 1.5% from existing clades or subclades, depending on their order. Thus, in these studies, the HA gene homology between the vaccine and the challenge virus strain was greater than 90%. In the present study, the percentage of homology between the vaccine and the challenge virus strain did not exceed 81%. Moreover, the vaccine virus strain was a LPAI strain while the challenge virus strain belonged to the H5Nx viral constellation.To the best of our knowledge, the current study demonstrated for the first time the ability of a subunit vaccine formulation incorporating conserved M2e antigens and HA1 to provide a complete protection from disease and virus shedding after a challenge with highly divergent HPAI H5 virus in chickens. Such protection may be due to the neutralizing activity of HA1-specific antibodies as a first virus barrier, followed later on by the M2e-specific antibody- or T cell-mediated cytotoxic activities that would contribute to completely eliminate the virus and prevent virus dissemination within the host. Whatever the mechanism is, our study demonstrated that the supplementation of NR-3M2e or NF-3M2e with HA1 protein is an alternative strategy to enhance the cross-protection against avian influenza H5 viruses in chickens. In the commercial poultry settings, highly desirable and cost-effective vaccines are those that can offer relatively high protection from the first dose. In line with this approach, it would be very interesting to investigate in the future whether our combined vaccine formulations provide adequate protection even after reducing the number of vaccine doses.MethodsViruses and vaccine antigensA/chicken/BC/FAV-002/2015 HPAI H5N1 (2.3.4.4c) virus [accession numbers: KP892988 to KP892995] isolated from a backyard layer chicken flock near Chilliwack, British Columbia (National Centre for Foreign Animal Disease [NCFAD], Winnipeg, Canada) was used in the heterologous challenge experiment47. The virus was inoculated via the allantoic route in 9-day-old SPF embryonated chicken eggs (Canadian Food Inspection Agency [CFIA] Fallowfield Laboratory, Ottawa, Canada) and incubated at 37°C for 48-72 h or until embryos died. The allantoic fluid was harvested and the virus titer was determined in Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells and expressed as PFU/ml. The stock virus had a titer of 1.2 × 106 PFU/ml. The M2e sequence MSLLTEVETPTRTEWECRCSDSSD was derived from A/chicken/BC/FAV-002/2015 HPAI H5N1 virus. The two cysteine residues of the M2e sequence (amino acids 17 and 19) were substituted to two serine residues to avoid formation of a disulfide bond that could impair the assembly of the nanoparticles34. The recombinant HA1 protein was produced from North American lineage Aurkey/Ontario/6213/1966 LPAI H5N1 virus (GenBank accession number CY107858).Production of HA1 proteinThe expression and purification of soluble recombinant HA1 protein was performed as previously described86. Briefly, the codon-optimized HA1 gene for expression in insect cells was cloned into a pAB-beeTM-FH vector (AB Vector, San Diego, CA) through GenScript services (GenScript USA Inc, Piscataway, NJ). The vector was purified and co-transfected with linearized baculovirus vector DNA and ProFoldTM-ER1 (AB Vector) into Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) insect cells to generate recombinant baculovirus containing the HA1 gene. The baculovirus was plaque-purified and sequenced for HA1 gene validation. Sf9 cells were infected with the baculovirus, and incubated for 72 h at 27°C under agitation. Cells were pelleted and lysed with I-PER insect cell protein extraction reagent (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL). The supernatant was purified using Ni-NTA bead resin and the presence of the recombinant protein was confirmed by Western blotting (Supplementary Fig. 3) using mouse monoclonal antibody against HA1 (40).Production of NR-3M2eThe pET-N-Sac plasmid was obtained from the pET-N plasmid, which contained the full-length coding sequence of the N protein derived from RSV Long strain (ATCC VR-26, GenBank accession number AY911262.1), by introducing a SacI restriction enzyme site in frame and at the C-terminal end of the N sequence34. To obtain the pET-N-3M2e plasmid containing three repetitions of the M2e sequence, the synthesized pUC57-3M2e plasmid (ProteoGenix, Schiltigheim, France) was used as a template to amplify the 3M2e sequence by PCR using the Phusion high-fidelity DNA polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) with gene-specific primers flanked with SacI/SacI (forward primereverse primer) sites. The PCR-amplified 3M2e sequence was then digested by SacI enzyme and inserted into the pET-N-Sac plasmid using the same restriction site. NR-3M2e were expressed and purified as previously described34,36,40. The identity and antigenicity of NR-3M2e were validated by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot assays with anti-N (rabbit polyclonal antibody against N at a dilution of 1:3,000) and anti-M2e (mouse 14C2 monoclonal antibody against M2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX) at a dilution of 1:3,000) antibodies. The structural integrity of the NRs was confirmed by DLS and TEM, as described previously40. The absence of endotoxins in the NR-3M2e vaccine was confirmed using the toxin sensor chromogenic LAL endotoxin assay (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL) with a sensitivity limit of 0.03 EU/ml.Production of NF-3M2eThe pET-29a (+) plasmid containing three repetitions of the M2e sequence fused in frame at the N-terminal end of the E. coli CsgA sequence (GenBank accession number WP124055573) was provided by GenScript (Piscataway, NJ). To express NF-3M2e, E. coli NiCo21(DE3) competent cells (New England Biolabs Inc., Ipswich, MA, USA) transformed with the pET-3M2e-CsgA plasmid were grown at 37 °C under agitation (225 rpm) in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml of kanamycin. Protein expression was induced by adding 1 µM IPTG to mid-log-phase cells (OD600nm ~ 1) and subsequent incubation for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were then harvested by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 15 min and stored at -80 °C. All purification steps were performed under denaturing conditions with 8 M guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) to prevent uncontrolled aggregation, until the assembly was precisely initiated by switching from 8 M GdnHCl to PBS buffer. Thawed cell pellet was resuspended in 8 M GdnHCl, PBS pH 7.2 and sonicated on ice using six cycles of 20 s. Clarification of lysate was achieved by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The protein of interest was purified over a Ni-charged ProfinityTM metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC) resin (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA) in a gravity flow column equilibrated in 8 M GdnHCl, PBS pH 7.2. The column was washed with 8 M GdnHCl, PBS pH 7.2 supplemented with 12.5 mM imidazole, and protein was eluted using 250 mM imidazole in PBS pH 7.4. A final desalting step was performed using a Sephadex G-25 fine desalting column in PBS pH 7.4. The identity and antigenicity of NF-3M2e were validated by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot assays with anti-M2 (mouse 14C2 monoclonal antibody against M2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX) at a dilution of 1:3,000) antibody. The (supra)structural characterization of the NFs was validated by CD spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy and TEM, as described below. Removal of endotoxins from the NF-3M2e vaccine was performed using Pierce endotoxin-removal spin columns and was confirmed using the toxin sensor chromogenic LAL endotoxin assay with a sensitivity limit of 0.03 EU/ml.Circular dichroism spectroscopyA Jasco J-815 CD (Jasco Inc., Easton, MD, USA) spectrometer was used to record Far-UV CD spectra from 190 to 260 nm at room temperature. The wavelength step was set at 0.5 nm with a scan rate of 20 nm × min-1. Each collected spectrum was background subtracted with protein-free buffer (PBS pH 7.4). The raw data were converted to mean residue ellipticity (MRE) as described elsewhere43,44.Fluorescence spectroscopyThT (1 mM) was added to NF-3M2e sample to reach a final ThT concentration of 40 µM, and fluorescence emission was recorded by a PTI QuantaMasterTM (Horiba Ltd., Kyoto, Japan) spectrofluorometer from 450 nm to 550 nm at an excitation wavelength of 440 nm. The final concentration of ANS was 450 µM and the fluorescence emission was measured between 385 nm and 550 nm with a constant excitation at 370 nm. Fluorescence was measured in ultramicro 10 mm length quartz cells. Data are expressed as arithmetic means with the standard error of the mean ( ± SEM) of at least three individual experiments performed in triplicate.Transmission electron microscopyNF-3M2e samples at 0, 24 and 48 h of self-assembly were diluted in 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) before being applied to glow-discharged carbon films on 400 mesh copper grids. After adsorption, samples were negatively stained with 1.5% uranyl formate for 1 min and air-dried for 15 min. Images were recorded using a FEI Tecnai 12 BioTwin microscope as described elsewhere43,44. Electron micrographs of NR-3M2e were acquired using a CM12 TEM (Royal Philips Electronics, Amsterdam, Netherlands) at 80 kV excitation voltage. Samples at 0.05-1 mg/ml were applied onto an airglow- discharged carbon-coated 200-mesh copper grid and stained with a 2% uranyl acetate aqueous solution.Dynamic light scatteringSize measurements with the Zetasizer Nano series (Malvern Panalytical, Malvern, UK) based on the principle of DLS were made at 20°C using a helium-neon laser wavelength of 633 nm and detection angle of 173°. The results were presented as size distribution by volume calculated from the Malvern software.Animal experimentsAll animal experiments were conducted after approval by the Canadian Science Centre for Human and Animal Health institutional guidelines for animal care (AUD# C-20-007). One-day-old SPF white Leghorn layer chickens (CFIA, Ottawa, Canada) were housed in heated BSL3 plus animal cubicles at the NCFAD on a floor system. Feed and water were ad libitum, and the animal cubicles were enriched with cupboards and porches. When chickens were 21-day-old, they were randomly assigned to six experimental groups (n = 14-15/group) and kept in a separate cubicle. The vaccine formulations consisted of HA1 protein (15 µg) admixed with NF-3M2e (50 µg) or with NR-3M2e (50 µg), or each single component administered alone. The last group served as unvaccinated PBS group. Before administration, vaccine antigens were mixed with Emulsigen®-P (MVP Adjuvants, Phibro Animal Health, NJ) for 2 h under gentle agitation. Three vaccinations were applied via the intramuscular route. The two booster vaccinations were applied two weeks apart. On days 14, 28, and 42 post-primary vaccination, sera were collected from each bird. Chickens were challenged at day 42 post-primary vaccination with 2.3 × 102 PFU of heterologous A/chicken/BC/FAV-002/2015 virus in 100 µl endotoxin-free PBS via the intranasal route (50 µlostril). They were observed daily for clinical signs and scored as follows: 1) clinically normal - chickens fed, drank and moved well; 2) mild clinical disease - chickens showed either one or a combination of the following clinical signs: depression, mouth breathing, diarrhea, mild neurological signs, wing drooping, facial edema - but moved freely, ate and drank; 3) severely sick - chickens showed any of the above clinical signs, were unable to move and drink - chickens euthanized and recorded as dead birds the next day; 4) dead - chickens died acutely with no overt clinical signs. The clinical scores of each chicken of each group are indicated in Supplementary Table 1. Moreover, oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs were collected on 3, 5, 7, 10 and 14 dpc. On 3 dpc (PBS, NF-3M2e and NR-3M2e groups), 19 dpc (HA1 group) and 21 dpc ([NR-3M2e + HA1] and [NF-3M2e + HA1] groups), chickens (n = 1 per group) were euthanized and tissue samples from brain, lung, and heart were collected and fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin for histopathological/immunohistochemistry assessments. For euthanasia of sick birds and at the end of the experiment, each bird was anesthetized with isoflurane (5% for induction and 2-3% for maintenance, delivered in 100% oxygen via a mask) using a Bain open anesthetic system (Benson Medical Industries INC., ON, Canada) set with a flow rate of 2–5 L/min. The birds were then euthanized by intracardiac injection of euthanyl (BIMEDA-MTC Animal Health INC., ON, Canada) at a dose of 40-60 mg/kg (Supplementary File 1).Hemagglutination inhibition assayThe HI assay was performed according to WOAH manual standardized protocol87. Briefly, two-fold serially diluted serum samples from each chicken were incubated with four HA units of the Aurkey/Ontario/6213/1966 (H5N1) virus in a V-bottom plates (Costar, Cole-Parmer Canada, Quebec, Canada) and incubated for 30 min. Subsequently, 0.5% chicken red blood cells were added and incubated for another 30 min. The HI titers were scored as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution resulting in 100% inhibition of chicken red blood cells from hemagglutination. When no HI was obtained, an HI titer of 2 was given for plotting.Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assayHA1-specific antibody response in serum samples was evaluated by competitive ELISA as described previously86 with modifications. Briefly, 96-well flat-bottom polystyrene plates (Nunc MaxiSorp™; Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) were coated with recombinant HA1 protein in carbonate- bicarbonate buffer 0.1 M (pH 9.6). After blocking, diluted sera (1:10) were added to the plates right before the addition of F73-H5-3 monoclonal antibody (1:300)86, and subsequently incubated for 1 h at 37°C with agitation. Each serum was assayed in duplicate. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:2000) (Jackson) was added and incubated at 37°C for 1 h with agitation. Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate was added, and plates were further incubated for 15 min at room temperature with shaking in the dark. Enzyme reaction was stopped with 2 M H2SO4, and absorbance was read at 450 nm with an ELISA plate reader. Results are expressed as percent inhibition [1-(ODchicken serum+Mab/ODMab)*100]. Values above 40% inhibition are considered positive.The presence of M2e-specific antibodies in serum samples was evaluated by indirect ELISA using the same 96-well flat-bottom microtiter plates (Nunc MaxiSorp™) as above. The plates were coated with synthetic M2e peptide (200 ng/well in 0.1 M carbonate-bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.6)) overnight at 4°C. Plates were washed five times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T), blocked in 0.5% BSA for 1 h at room temperature, and diluted sera (1:3200) were added and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. Negative control wells only contained PBS-T. Plates were washed and then incubated with HRP-conjugated donkey anti-chicken IgG (1:5000 in PBS-T) at 37°C for 1 h under agitation. TMB substrate was then added and plates were further incubated for 10 min at room temperature in the dark with gentle agitation. The enzymatic reaction was stopped with 1% 2 M H2SO4. The plates were read with an ELISA plate reader at an absorbance of 450 nm. The results were expressed as optical density (OD) values whose background (twice the OD450nm of negative wells) was subtracted.Determination of viral RNA shedding by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reactionTotal RNA was extracted from the oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs using the MagMAX 1835 Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The spiked Enteroviral armoured RNA (ARM-ENTERO; Asuragen) was used as an exogenous extraction and reaction control. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) targeting the matrix (M) gene of IAV was used to quantify viral RNA shedding as described previously88. Samples with Ct values > 38 were considered as negative as none of these samples yielded infectious viruses when inoculated via the allantoic route in 9-day-old SPF embryonated chicken eggs. A standard curve was generated from a 10-fold dilution series of an in vitro synthesized RNA template from the M gene of IAV to calculate M gene-specific RNA copy numbers in the samples based on the linear regression of the standard curve in LightCycler®480 System (Roche Diagnostics). The results were expressed as log10 viral RNA copy numbers/µl. The viral RNA copy numbers/µl of each chicken are indicated in Supplementary Table 1.Histopathology and immunohistochemistryTissues were collected only when birds reached a humane endpoint because they were severely ill (not eating, drinking, moving) and due to neurological signs or at the end of the experiments. Tissues fixed in 10% neutral phosphate buffered formalin were sectioned at 5 µm and stained with haematoxylin and eosin for histopathologic analysis. For immunohistochemistry, paraffin tissue sections were quenched for 10 min in aqueous 3% H2O2 and then pretreated with proteinase K for 15 min for epitope retrieval. A mouse monoclonal antibody specific for influenza A NP (F26NP9)89 was applied on the sections at a dilution of 1:10,000 for 1 h. The microscopic sections were then visualized using a horseradish peroxidase labeled polymer, Envision®+ system (anti-mouse) (Dako, USA), and reacted with the chromogen diaminobenzidine (DAB). The sections were then counter stained with Gill’s hematoxylin. The virus antigen load and distribution in the tissue section were visualized under the microscope and the intensity of coloration (brown) in the tissues of the different groups were qualitatively evaluated.Statistical data analysisThe log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test was used to compare the survival rates between groups. Otherwise, differences between the experimental groups were analyzed for significance using the Mann-Whitney rank sum test. All analyses were done using the Sigma Plot system v11.0 (Systat Software, San Jose, CA, USA). A P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

It's the first time the agency's national flu surveillance system has detected a human case of H5 virus without known exposure, the CDC said, adding that the general public's risk of bird flu, or avian influenza, remains low. The other 13 cases of H5 in humans were detected in targeted surveillance of people who've worked directly with sick animals, the agency said. H5 is the type of flu currently driving the outbreak among birds and cattle in the US.The person who was sick had underlying health conditions, was hospitalized and has since recovered, the CDC said. No other transmission has been found among contacts, and there's been no sign of unusual flu activity in people that would suggest a bigger public health threat. An investigation is ongoing, as more information is needed about the strain the patient was sick with. "It is important to note that, while rare, there have been novel influenza A cases where an animal source cannot be identified," the CDC said in its release, referencing the type of influenza that the bird flu outbreak strain belongs to. But ongoing investigation into the case will be "particularly important," the CDC said, "in light of the current lack of an obvious animal exposure."In the US, bird flu started out by ravaging the poultry industry in 2022 but made the jump to cattle this year and has been impacting the dairy industry since spring. That's thinned the line between where the virus has stayed so far — spreading among animals — and contact with humans.Health officials have been taking steps to curb the spread of avian influenza (specifically, H5N1 or "bird flu") by ramping up their monitoring of the virus and preparing for a worst-case scenario. The US Department of Health and Human Services announced in early July that the government is providing Moderna with $176 million to develop its influenza mRNA vaccine, which could be used if bird flu starting spreading person-to-person or became a pandemic. As long as animals and humans live, work and gather around each other, there will be a risk of viruses mutating enough to make the jump from species to species. Fortunately, bird flu in humans so far has been rare, in part because the virus doesn't spread that easily from animals to humans, or between humans, though sporadic cases have occurred in other countries as well as in the US. Here's what to know about bird flu, or avian influenza, and what it looks like in people. Bird flu started as a poultry and bird issue in the US but has spread to cows, which frequently have close contact with people. That increases the risk of the virus one day making the jump to humans.

In short, bird flu, aka avian influenza, is a type of flu that spreads between some animals and is currently causing outbreaks among birds and cattle in the US. Scientists are watching closely for mutations that could make it possible for the virus to spread between people, which would pose a major public health threat.More specifically, bird flu is a disease caused by infection with an influenza type A virus, and it's either "highly pathogenic" or "low pathogenic." The current H5N1 outbreak strain among animals is highly pathogenic. Bird flu was first detected and controlled in 1997, but it reemerged in 2003 and started spreading widely among birds.The World Health Organization reports four types of influenza viruses: A, B, C and D. Type A viruses, which occur in humans and in different kinds of animals, are the biggest threat to public health and can cause pandemics, the WHO says. The "swine flu" of 2009's pandemic was caused by a type A virus. Seasonal flu viruses in humans are caused by type A and type B viruses. Bird flu has been ravaging the US poultry industry for the last couple of years, resulting in the culling (killing) of millions of infected or potentially infected birds.

Is bird flu deadly? How many cases have there been in the US?With the additional case in Missouri, there have been 15 human cases of H5 (highly pathogenic) bird flu in the US since the bird flu outbreak began. Fourteen of them are from this year.Human cases remain rare, but bird flu is considered a serious threat to public health because of its historically high mortality rate -- about half the cases of bird flu H5N1 in people have resulted in death since tracking began, according to WHO information. No deaths from bird flu have been reported in the US; people who've tested positive for the virus historically have had direct contact with sick animals and exhibited mild symptoms. Earlier this summer, a handful of mild bird flu cases in farm workers from Colorado who had direct contact with sick birds were discovered. While they weren't the first human cases, the new cluster of cases prompted more concern that the virus may one day start spreading from person to person and pose a greater health threat to people. It also called attention to how some people are tasked with handling affected birds in potentially dangerous ways, and the risks to their health, as NPR reported. Can I get bird flu from milk, eggs or meat? There haven't been any reports of people getting bird flu in the US from drinking milk or eating meat from birds or cows. The commercial food supply, which makes up most food you'd get in a regular grocery store, is regulated, and meat from impacted animals shouldn't make it to store shelves. There have been fragments of inactive bird flu virus found in pasteurized milk samples since the virus started spreading to cows. The high-temperature pasteurization process inactivates any virus or bacteria, including bird flu, that could make people sick. Infectious virus has been found in raw milk, and the US Food and Drug Administration is reiterating the general health risks of drinking raw milk, not just in terms of bird flu but also for other pathogens that often live in unpasteurized milk. In terms of meat, cooking ground hamburger is also expected to kill the bird flu virus, according to the Department of Agriculture. The same is true for poultry; according to the CDC, cooking eggs and poultry to an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit kills viruses, including bird flu. It might be difficult to catch influenza from food or drink anyway, according to infectious disease experts we've spoken to in the past, since influenza (including bird flu) is a respiratory virus. If you work directly with animals or livestock, which would include working on a farm, or even if you visit a fair where there's livestock, you should check out the CDC's specific tips for safety to reduce the risk of spread.

The adult patient, who has underlying conditions, was admitted to hospital on August 22, received antiviral medications against influenza, then recovered and was discharged, according to statements from the Centers for Control and Disease Prevention (CDC) and the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services. As the patient’s flu type appeared suspicious on an initial test, it was sent for additional testing in state and federal laboratories, which revealed it was H5, also known as avian flu or bird flu. The CDC said it had not identified any transmission to the patient’s close contacts or any other person. Scientists have voiced concern about the growing number of mammals becoming infected by bird flu, even if cases in humans remain rare. They fear a high rate of transmission could facilitate a mutation of the virus, which could enable it to be passed from one human to another. Contacted by AFP, the World Health Organization said on Saturday it was “encouraging that the national disease surveillance system has identified this case, that the patient received antiviral treatment, and that no further cases have been detected among close contacts”. “It is critical that investigations into the patient’s exposure are continued, as indicated by national and state authorities, to inform further prevention and response activities,” said Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO’s director of epidemic and pandemic preparedness and prevention. “WHO strongly supports US efforts for surveillance of zoonotic influenza across human, environmental and animal sectors,” Van Kerkhove continued. “It is important to understand the circulation of avian influenza in poultry, wild birds and other animals in the state,” she said of Missouri. “Stronger disease surveillance in animals is essential to protect animal and human health.” No animal contact The person who tested positive for bird flu was the 14th to do so in the US this year, and the first without known contact with animals. Indeed, “no H5 infection in dairy cattle has been reported in Missouri,” said the Missouri health department, though “some H5 cases in commercial or backyard flocks and wild birds have been reported.” All previous bird flu cases in the United States have been among farmworkers, including the very first, in 2022. Bird flu is most commonly found in wild birds and poultry, but has more recently been detected in mammals, with an outbreak in cattle seen across the country this year. It can occasionally infect humans through close contact or contaminated environments. While the CDC continues to assess the risk to the public as low, “circumstances may change quickly as more information is learned”, it said. In the decades since H5 has been found in humans, there have been rare cases where an animal source cannot be identified. But there has so far not been evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission, which would significantly increase the threat level.A newsletter for the boldest, brightest leaders: CEO Daily is your weekday morning dossier on the news, trends, and chatter business leaders need to know.

When's the ideal time to get one, and should you get it with the Covid vaccine?Flu and Covid shots are now available at pharmacies. Both have new formulas this year, and they can be administered at the same time.This year’s flu shots are trivalent, meaning they protect against three flu viruses: two versions of influenza A and one of influenza B. Antonio Perez / TNS via Getty ImagesSept. 4, 2024, 9:11 PM UTC / Updated Sept. 5, 2024, 3:09 PM UTCBy Aria BendixFlu shot season is upon us.Pharmacies began giving out the vaccines — which are recommended for everyone ages 6 months and older — last month. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends getting a flu shot either this month or next, since flu activity typically picks up in the fall, with cases reaching their peak sometime from December to February. It takes around two weeks for the vaccine to become fully effective. “You really want to think about getting your appointment or making your plan to get vaccinated sometime around the last half of September through the end of October,” said Dr. Judith O’Donnell, chief of infectious diseases at Penn Presbyterian Medical Center in Philadelphia.This year’s flu shots are trivalent, meaning they protect against three flu viruses: two versions of influenza A and one type of influenza B. For more than a decade, flu shots in the U.S. also protected against a fourth strain of influenza B, but that strain hasn’t circulated since March 2020, so the Food and Drug Administration’s vaccine advisory committee elected this year to exclude it.What to know about flu shotsAlthough most people need one dose of the vaccine, children up to 8 who haven’t been vaccinated for flu before should get two shots at least four weeks apart. The CDC recommends that unvaccinated children get their first shot right away.Because adults ages 65 and up have the highest risk of severe illness from flu, they should ask for certain shots that produce a stronger immune response than a standard flu vaccine. The CDC recommends three options for this age group: Fluzone High-Dose, Flublok or Fluad. The first two are high-dose vaccines, meaning they contain a greater amount of antigen, an ingredient that triggers an immune response. Fluad, meanwhile, contains an ingredient that helps boost the immune response, called an adjuvant. “You have to really shop around and figure out where that’s available, because it won’t be available everywhere,” said Amanda Joy, a physician assistant at MedStar Health, a health care provider in the Washington, D.C., area. She suggested calling ahead to doctor’s offices or pharmacies.Last year, around 25,000 people died of the flu in the U.S. and 400,000 were hospitalized.The effectiveness of flu vaccines at preventing doctor’s visits tends to vary from year to year. Scientists choose which strains to target based on what’s circulating in other parts of the world, but it’s not a guarantee that those strains will dominate in the U.S.“In an optimal year, you get up to about 80% [effectiveness]. In a bad year, maybe 30%,” said Dr. Michelle Barron, senior medical director of infection prevention and control at UCHealth.Australia offers a window into what the U.S. can expect, since its flu season lasts from around June to September. This year, there weren’t an outsized number of hospitalizations or deaths.“It looks like it was a fairly typical flu season. It didn’t necessarily start early, which was our concern last year,” Barron said.Although some people with egg allergies may be hesitant to get flu vaccines, given that most are egg-based, the shots are still safe for that group. Joy said people with lingering concerns can seek out Flucelvax, a vaccine that’s developed using mammalian cells instead. Covid and flu shots can be administered at the same timeHealth experts expect flu and Covid to deliver a one-two punch during the fall and winter, as they have in past years. Although the summer wave of Covid cases hasn’t died down yet, experts anticipate another wave this winter, perhaps at the same time that flu cases peak.The new Covid vaccines target the KP.2 variant, which became dominant in the U.S. at the end of April. A genetically similar strain, KP.3.1.1, has since taken over, but the latest vaccine should still offer better protection against it than previous Covid shots.The shots are recommended for everyone 6 months and older. Children up to 4 years old should get at least one dose of the new formula, and potentially two or three if they’ve never been vaccinated before, according to the CDC.Everyone else should get one dose. People who recently had Covid can wait to get their shot until three months after their infection, since they’re likely to have some immunity already. The Covid and flu shots can be safely administered at the same time, in the same arm or different ones. The CDC recommends getting both at once for convenience, though it’s unclear if this brings additional advantages. A small study published in April found that co-administering Covid and flu shots boosted the antibody response to Covid in blood samples, but experts aren’t sure if that translates to more protection.Getting the shots at once might also slightly increase side effects, according to a CDC study, though the reactions are still generally mild.“You may feel some aches and some chills and maybe a low-grade temperature if you get them both together, but you could also get that from each individually,” Joy said.She added that when finding a time to get any vaccine, it’s best to hold off if you’re feeling unwell.“You may not get the full response you want if you’re getting vaccines while you’re sick, so it’s much better to wait ‘til you’re healthy,” she said.How much do the shots cost?Flu shots are available at doctor’s offices, pharmacies, health clinics and through some workplaces.CVS, Walgreens and Walmart pharmacies all have Covid and flu vaccines in stock, though certain Walmart stores won’t carry Covid shots until mid-September.People with insurance shouldn’t have to pay out-of-pocket for the vaccines as long as they get them from an in-network provider. Covid and flu shots are also covered for children without insurance through the government-run Vaccines for Children Program. Adults without insurance may be able to find free or low-cost vaccines at some federally qualified health centers or state or local health departments, but supply can be limited. Otherwise, the Covid vaccine costs around $150 to $200 — a difference from past years, when they were free regardless of insurance status. The CDC’s Bridge Access Program, which paid for Covid shots for uninsured adults, ended in August.Flu vaccines can range from $25 to more than $100, depending on the shot.CORRECTION (Sept. 5, 2024, 11:09 a.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated the availability of Covid vaccines at Walmart.

Here’s why state fairs could be potential breeding grounds for viral mutation. Shots Health News From NPR Your Health Treatments & Tests Health Inc. Policy-ish Public Health Twitter Shots - Health News Could bird flu spread at state fairs? Here’s why health experts advise caution September 4, 20247:00 AM ET From Side Effects Public Media By Benjamin Thorp Indiana’s state fair will bring animals from across the state together. Experts say it poses a risk for the spread of bird flu Benjamin Thorp/WFYI hide caption toggle caption Benjamin Thorp/WFYI Between July and October states across the country hold their annual state fairs. The events are known for things like Ferris wheels and corn dogs, sculptures made entirely from butter and the biggest pig in the state. But state fairs can also be places where it’s easier to spread disease – bringing humans and animals from farms across the state into close contact. That’s of particular concern this year, as H5N1 or bird flu infections have been confirmed in dairy cattle in 14 U.S. states, including in California as of last Thursday. The virus has also infected four dairy workers across Michigan, Texas, and Colorado. Sponsor Message Shots - Health News With the U.S. bird flu outbreak uncontained, scientists see growing risks But that’s not keeping many fairgoers from lining up in front of the cattle nosing their way out of their barn fences. Mel Ventimiglia stood by several cows with his grandkids inside a barn at the Indiana State Fair in Indianapolis on a weekday in August. He said bird flu isn’t even on his radar. “I haven’t heard anybody mention it except for you,” he told Side Effects. “Hopefully, I forget about it pretty quickly.” At the fair, members of the public are able to interact with animals. Health experts are advising at-risk people to exercise caution. Benjamin Thorp/WFYI hide caption toggle caption Benjamin Thorp/WFYI At another nearby cattle barn, farmer Randy Mason says he follows basic precautions to keep his cattle from getting sick while at the fair, but he’s not particularly worried. “A lot of that in my opinion gets overblown,” he said. “They get one or two cases and then it becomes –– like everything the government does –– it becomes overblown and out of proportion.” But across the country, bird flu infections have been confirmed in nearly 200 herds, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That’s led officials at some state fairs to enact stricter rules to keep the virus from spreading. In Minnesota, which has detected cases of bird flu within its dairy cattle, the state is requiring all cows to have a negative bird flu test before coming to the state fair. Sponsor Message That’s not the case in many other states, however, including Indiana, where there haven’t been any confirmed cases of bird flu. “Since we've not had a diagnosis, we've not put those additional measures,” said Bret Marsh, Indiana state veterinarian. He said the state has told farmers to keep an eye out for signs of bird flu in their animals. They have also communicated to farmers the risks of spreading illness when coming to the fair and advised that animals are quarantined for 30 days after being shown. But until there’s a positive test in Indiana, Marsh said, the state doesn’t need to put tighter restrictions in place. Shots - Health News U.S. is 'flying blind' with bird flu, repeating mistakes of COVID, health experts say Why are state fairs a concern? But scientists widely agree that there is not enough testing going on to fully understand which states have cows infected with bird flu. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said states like Indiana don’t have any positive bird flu cases in cattle because they aren’t looking for them. “The assumption should be, this virus is in the state of Indiana, we just haven't found it yet,” he said. “That's what they should be messaging, not ‘Our cows are free.’ That's foolish to believe.” That makes sites like state fairs –– where humans will be coming into contact with different animals –– especially concerning. Scientists worry that the bird flu could mutate to spread more easily among mammals, including humans, if given the opportunity. Currently, the virus seems to only have infected humans coming in direct contact with the udders and equipment used on infected cows, or farm workers involved in culling infected poultry flocks. The handful of human cases have had mild symptoms including conjunctivitis or pink eye in humans. The broader concern is that the virus could mutate into a respiratory virus which would spread more easily from person to person. Sponsor Message And fairs have a history of being places where that spillover – from animals to humans – happen. Indiana’s state fair has signs posted reminding visitors to wash their hands after visiting the cattle barn. Benjamin Thorp/WFYI hide caption toggle caption Benjamin Thorp/WFYI In 2012 a major swine flu outbreak led to over 300 infections in the U.S., with the majority of those associated with exposure at agricultural fairs. And last year, the CDC reported that two people caught swine flu after visiting pig exhibits. Each time an influenza virus jumps into a new host it’s given an opportunity to evolve, potentially becoming one that could begin to spread among humans. Experts worry that the risk of H5N1 becoming a human virus could be substantially heightened if the virus makes it to pigs in particular because they are a perfect mixing vessel for viruses from different species. This means that the different viruses can exchange genetic material and learn from one another, potentially mutating and becoming more adept at infecting humans. “One of the things that people bring up so much about COVID-19 are the animal markets in China, where you have multiple different animals and different species interacting with each other,” Adalja said. “Similar things happen at state fairs in the United States. That's not really any different.” Andrew Bowman, professor of veterinary preventive medicine at the Ohio State University, agrees that the co-mingling of animals and people at state fairs poses a risk. “We've thought about new pandemic viruses arising from Southeast Asian live animal markets. And we think, ‘Oh, we would never do that in the U.S.’ Well, fairs kind of mimic that,” he said. The public health risk is still low Still, experts like Bowman say that isn’t a reason to miss out on the state fair altogether. “I'm still going to the fair, and my family is still going to the fair. I had a milkshake when I was there,” Bowman said. Sponsor Message He added that at-risk populations, such as the immunocompromised, should consider avoiding the cattle barn this year. “You know, exercise caution and really kind of think about which contacts [you] need to have,” Bowman said. “Can I enjoy the animal exhibits, maybe from a little further distance, and not get right in the middle of it?” The CDC issued guidance in June for state fairs to reduce the spread of bird flu, including a prohibition on dumping milk on the ground, because raw milk from infected cattle is likely to carry live virus. The guidance also advises keeping cows from different herds apart, and encourages visitors to wash their hands before leaving a barn. Earlier this year the U.S. Department of Agriculture instituted a rule requiring cows test negative for the virus before crossing state lines. Still, the risk to humans from the bird flu virus remains low, according to the CDC’s assessment.

Bird flu has been slowly spreading across the nation's farms since the beginning of spring. So far, there have been 14 human cases of the virus. All the patients — except the one from Missouri — had been linked to sick dairy cows or poultry. Sponsor Message Shots - Health News Bird flu cases among farm workers may be going undetected, a study suggests The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday that the Missouri patient was hospitalized and treated with influenza antiviral medications. The patient has since recovered and been discharged. The agency added that the virus did not appear to have spread to the patient's close contacts. Aside from Missouri, human cases have been reported in Texas, Michigan and Colorado. At least 196 dairy cattle herds as well as 56 commercial and backyard poultry flocks have been infected nationwide, according to the CDC. Goats and Soda Thailand beat avian flu 20 years ago. What can we learn from their strategies? Shots - Health News Could bird flu spread at state fairs? Here’s why health experts advise caution There are no known bird flu outbreaks in cattle in Missouri, the CDC said. But there have been outbreaks in commercial and backyard poultry flocks in the state this year. In previous years, bird flu has been detected in wild birds in that state. The CDC said its current risk assessment of bird flu to the general public "remains low." It said "there has been no sign of unusual influenza activity in people, including in Missouri." The agency recommends that people avoid contact with sick or dead animals — regardless of whether the animals are wild or domesticated. The CDC also warns against drinking raw milk, adding that pasteurization kills the virus and pasteurized milk is safe to drink. bird flu Facebook Flipboard Email Read & Listen Home News Culture Music Podcasts & Shows Connect Newsletters Facebook Instagram Press Public Editor Corrections Contact & Help About NPR Overview Diversity NPR Network Accessibility Ethics Finances Get Involved Support Public Radio Sponsor NPR NPR Careers NPR Shop NPR Events NPR Extra Terms of Use Privacy Your Privacy Choices Text Only Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsorOseltamivir and peramivir may reduce length-of-hospital-stay in patients with severe influenza | 2 Minute Medicine About Masthead License Content Advertise Submit Press Release RSS/Email List 2MM Podcast Write for us Contact Us No Result View All Result No products in the cart.

Time in hospital was modestly reduced in both intervention groups compared to the control. 2. There was little to no improvement in symptom alleviation with oseltamivir and peramivir compared to control. Evidence Rating Level: 1 (Excellent) Study Rundown: There is little consensus around the first-line antiviral treatment for severe influenza. This systematic review of randomized controlled trials assessed different antivirals used in hospitalized patients with severe influenza. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of various antiviral drugs, including oseltamivir, peramivir, and zanamivir, in reducing important clinical outcomes compared to placebo or standard care. The primary outcome of this study was the reduction in length-of-hospital-stay, while a key secondary outcome was time to symptom alleviation. According to study results, oseltamivir and peramivir have the potential to modestly reduce the duration of hospital stay while the effect on mortality remains unclear. This study was limited by a small number of eligible trials and low certainty of evidence, which hinders drawing strong conclusions about the benefits of these antivirals.

Included were studies with patients hospitalized due to suspected or confirmed severe influenza who received direct-acting antiviral treatment. Altogether, 8 trials involving 1,424 participants were included in the final analysis. The primary outcome of duration of hospital stay was modestly reduced in the oseltamivir (mean difference -1.63 days, 95% confidence interval [CI] -2.81 to -0.45) and peramivir (-1.73 days, 95% CI -3.33 to -0.13) groups compared to standard care. The secondary outcome of symptom alleviation showed minimal to no improvement with oseltamivir (0.34 days; low certainty evidence) and peramivir (-0.05 days; low certainty evidence). Findings from this study suggest that while oseltamivir and peramivir may shorten hospital stays in patients with severe influenza, the overall benefit on mortality remains uncertain.

Last week, Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack announced that USDA has authorized the first field trial of a vaccine for the virus.Several groups have been working on developing a vaccine for this novel concern that was first confirmed in March, he continued. All trials have so far been conducted in contained research facilities, such as the one at the National Animal Disease Research Center, a USDA facility in Ames, Iowa. This approval will allow potential H5N1 vaccines to instead be tested in environments that more closely resemble today’s dairy farms.It is an important development in equipping dairy farmers with a plan of attack against the disease. Since March, 193 cases have been confirmed in 13 states. Fortunately, spread has slowed this summer, with just 20 new cases in five states confirmed in the last month. While cows that contract the disease have not been as severely impacted as poultry that do, milk production and feed intake are affected, leading impacted herds to cull cattle even after they recover due to lingering effects. There are also concerns about the disease spreading to humans after a handful of farm workers who have been around sick cows experienced mild disease symptoms.No vaccines against the disease have been developed for poultry. Vilsack expressed optimism that with information from a field trial in dairy cattle, a vaccine that is safe and effective could be developed in the near future.Research has been crucial because the movement of the virus to dairy cattle was not expected. As this timeline from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicates, forms of the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus have been detected in multiple species around the world for more than a century. There is much still unknown about how it spreads and mutates. In dairy cattle, it appears to be developing in the udder, which contains many potential receptors for the virus. This is in contrast to how influenza viruses typically infect the respiratory system.Until a vaccine is tested and approved, a dairy farmer’s best protection against the disease is to continue taking biosecurity measures to prevent new contaminants from entering the farm.

The best way to protect yourself and your loved ones against influenza is to get a flu vaccine every flu season, said Dr. Travis Walker, chief medical officer at CHA Nevada.“I recommend that everyone six months and older get a seasonal flu shot,” he said. “The flu vaccine helps prevent illness and the more people that are vaccinated, the more we can prevent the spread of the virus and the more likely we are to prevent people being hospitalized or deaths related to influenza.”According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), September and October are generally good times to be vaccinated against influenza. Ideally, everyone should be vaccinated by the end of October.Flu signs and symptoms usually come on suddenly. People who are sick with flu often experience fever, cough, sore throat, runny nose and muscle or body aches.Community Health Alliance will also receive the new COVID booster in the next few weeks, Walker said.This vaccine is especially recommended to adults who are older or who have multiple medical conditions.”This year the specific type of vaccine or strain that we're fighting is the J.N 1 strain of COVID. And so the booster or vaccine this year is specifically formulated for the type of virus that's circulating right now,” he said.People can make an appointment online at CHANevada.org or by calling (775) 329-6300 Local Stories Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email Maria Palma Maria joined KUNR Public Radio in December 2022 as a staff reporter.

WASHINGTON – The California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) confirmed the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) was found at three dairy farms in the Central Valley. Congressman David G. Valadao (CA-22) released the following statement: “As a dairyman I’ve been closely following this situation since the first avian influenza case was detected in U.S. dairy cattle, and have remained in contact with dairy producers, USDA, CDC, and CDFA to ensure the dairy industry is equipped to keep dairy cattle and the workers who interact with these animals healthy,” said Congressman Valadao. “Thankfully, there is no milk, meat, or dairy product safety concern for consumers. I’ll continue working with local, state, and federal partners to bring avian influenza research to the forefront and better equip the industry to deal with these kinds of diseases.” Congressman Valadao is a co-sponsor of the Avian Influenza Research and Response Act, which would: Prioritize highly pathogenic avian influenza research under USDA’s Agriculture and Food Research Initiative. Codify in law recent USDA rulemaking that allows for dairy producers to be compensated for loss of milk production due to avian influenza infection. Direct the Secretary of Agriculture to establish a Dairy Biosecurity Education and Training program. ### Related News Disaster relief needed to help ag producers October 25, 2024 | Posted in In the News Congressman Valadao Introduces Supplemental Appropriations Bill to Assist Ag Producers Impacted by Natural Disasters September 27, 2024 | Posted in Press Releases Congressman Valadao Introduces Legislation to Fix Central Valley Roads September 10, 2024 | Posted in Press Releases Congressman Valadao Statement on Confirmed Avian Flu Cases in California Dairies September 4, 2024 | Posted in Press Releases Washington, DC Office 2465 Rayburn HOB Washington, DC 20515 (202) 225-4695 Bakersfield District Office 2700 M Street Suite 250B Bakersfield, CA 93301 Phone: (661) 864-7736 Fax: (833) 284-9090 Hanford District Office 107 South Douty Street Hanford, CA 93230 Phone: (559) 460-6070 Fax: (559) 584-3564 PRIVACY Accessibility Contact house.gov facebook twitter back to top Back to topComparison of Three Influenza Surveillance Data Sources for Timely Detection of Epidemic Onset — Chengdu City, Sichuan Province and Beijing Municipality, China, 2017–2023 Comparison of Three Influenza Surveillance Data Sources for Timely Detection of Epidemic Onset — Chengdu City, Sichuan Province and Beijing Municipality, China, 2017–2023 Advanced Search Search CCDC Weekly A-Z INDEX A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z # Home AllTitleAuthorAbstractDOICategoryAddressFund Home Publications Weekly Reports Past Volumes1 Manuscript Submission Instructions for Authors About CCDC Weekly Editorial Office Editorial Board Advisory Committee Youth Editorial Board Subscriptions Subscribe for E-mail Alerts CCDCW Paper Subscriptions Contact Us PDF Cite Share facebook twitter google linkedin AllTitleAuthorAbstractDOICategoryAddressFund Article Navigation > China CDC Weekly > 2024, 6(36): 918-923 Preplanned Studies: Comparison of Three Influenza Surveillance Data Sources for Timely Detection of Epidemic Onset — Chengdu City, Sichuan Province and Beijing Municipality, China, 2017–2023 Mingyue Pan1; Ying Shen1,2; Yao Wang3; Lu Long3; Xunbo Du3; Ying Sun1,2; Daitao Zhang1,2; Hui Yao1; Yonghong Liu1; Peng Yang1,2, ; Quanyi Wang1,2, ; Xiaoli Wang1,2, , ; Liang Wang3, , View author affiliations Summary What is already known about this topic?

Despite its historical significance, the effectiveness of this system is often compromised during periods when multiple respiratory pathogens are present, which may obscure the specific activities of the influenza virus (3–4). In addition to the ILI surveillance system, China employs two other primary systems for influenza monitoring: the nationwide Notifiable Infectious Diseases Reporting Information System (NIDRIS) and the Virological Surveillance System (5). A notable challenge within these systems is the potential for undiagnosed or misdiagnosed influenza cases, particularly during non-epidemic periods and in the absence of laboratory confirmation. Nevertheless, NIDRIS requires the nationwide reporting of all confirmed influenza cases, providing a comprehensive dataset for analysis. On the other hand, the Virological Surveillance System, while offering highly accurate tracking of viral activities, is hampered by its time-intensive processes and lack of immediate data availability. This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of these three surveillance datasets in detecting the timely onset of influenza epidemics. We employed the exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) and a modified version of the Cumulative Sum (modified-CUSUM) to assess the performance of each dataset. The findings from our evaluation suggested that the data derived from NIDRIS demonstrated superior performance in the early detection of influenza epidemics, particularly in scenarios involving the co-circulation of various respiratory pathogens. Based on these results, we recommend that public health practitioners in China prioritize the use of NIDRIS-reported case data to enhance the accuracy and timeliness of influenza epidemic detection. This approach could significantly improve the responsiveness and effectiveness of public health interventions against influenza outbreaks. We analyzed three datasets covering the period from 2017 to 2023 to facilitate early detection of influenza epidemics in Chengdu City, Sichuan Province and Beijing Municipality, cities emblematic of the southern and northern China, respectively. The first dataset comprised the daily count of reported influenza cases from the NIDRIS. The second dataset included daily reports of ILI cases from an ILI surveillance network, drawing data from 144 sentinel hospitals in Beijing and 11 in Chengdu. Finally, the third dataset was constructed by multiplying weekly ILI reports by the influenza positivity rate (PR) (ILIs*PR), as determined from the Virological Surveillance System active in Beijing and Chengdu. We utilized two widely accepted outbreak detection algorithms, the EWMA and the modified-CUSUM, to facilitate early warnings of influenza epidemics (Supplementary Material). The EWMA algorithm is designed for analyzing time series data by applying exponentially decreasing weights to older observations. An alert is triggered when the moving average surpasses a predefined threshold. Similarly, the modified-CUSUM algorithm monitors the cumulative difference between observed and expected values, issuing an alert when this deviation exceeds its respective threshold (6). The benchmark for these analyses was the influenza PR, which we deemed the gold standard. We defined the influenza season as spanning from the 27th week of one year to the 26th week of the following year. The threshold for an alert was set when the PR exceeded 40% of its peak value (7). To assess model performance, we employed evaluation criteria including sensitivity, specificity, and the Youden Index to optimize parameters. Sensitivity measures the model’s ability to correctly identify true positive instances when an alert is warranted, calculated as the ratio of true positives to all instances that should trigger an alarm. Specificity, in contrast, evaluates the model’s accuracy in identifying true negative instances where no alert is needed, computed as the ratio of true negatives to all instances without an alarm (8). The Youden Index is derived by summing the sensitivity and specificity and then subtracting one, providing a single statistic that balances both metrics. Data for each season were partitioned into training and test sets to facilitate early warnings. For the 2021–2022 season, for instance, all preceding data was utilized as the training set, while data from the 2021–2022 season comprised the test set. This approach was uniformly adopted for subsequent seasons. We optimized parameter values using the training sets, employing evaluation metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, and the Youden Index to determine effectiveness. Subsequently, the model demonstrating the highest performance with these optimized parameters was selected for early signal detection in the test sets. In the case of the ILIs*PR dataset, the PR for the most recent week was only available on the final day of that week. Consequently, we employed a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model (9) to forecast the latest PR in the test sets. The LSTM network, a variant of recurrent neural network, is particularly adept at longitudinal data prediction. It effectively retains critical data over time, which is essential for capturing long-term dependencies that enhance the accuracy of both current and future predictions. Prediction accuracy was quantified using the mean squared error (MSE). All analyses were conducted using R (Version 4.3.1, R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria), except for the LSTM model which was implemented using Python (Version 3.8.13, Python Software Foundation, Beaverton, USA). Surveillance data from Beijing revealed a consistent annual peak in ILIs each January up until 2020. However, the emergence of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the simultaneous circulation of multiple respiratory pathogens disrupted this established seasonal trend. Notably, an atypical peak occurred in 2023, occurring despite limited influenza virus activity (Figure 1). In contrast, the combination of reported ILI cases and virus PRs provided a more accurate reflection of influenza virus activity when the virus was actively circulating. Figure 1. The 7-day moving average of the daily number of new cases in the three datasets and the weekly influenza positivity rate, 2013–2023. (A) In Beijing Municipality; (B) In Chengdu City, Sichuan Province. Note: This figure illustrates the trends in the 7-day moving average of reported influenza cases, ILI cases, ILI cases adjusted for influenza positivity rate, and the weekly influenza positivity rate. The light blue shaded area represents the trend in ILI cases, while the dark blue shaded area indicates the trend in ILI cases adjusted by the influenza positivity rate. The pink shaded area depicts the trend in reported cases derived from the nationwide NIDRIS. The dotted line displays the weekly influenza positivity rate. Reported cases indicate the number of reported cases from the nationwide NIDRIS; ILIs*PR indicates the number of cases of influenza-like illness multiplied by the positivity rate of the influenza virus. Abbreviation: PR=positivity rate; NIDRIS=Notifiable Infectious Diseases Reporting Information System; ILI=influenza-like illness. During periods of concurrent circulation of multiple respiratory pathogens, both reported cases and ILIs*PR demonstrated superior performance compared to ILIs alone. Specifically, across the last three seasons in Beijing, reported cases and ILIs*PR consistently exhibited good sensitivity, with reported cases also displaying strong specificity. The composite Youden Index for these three seasons indicated that reported cases achieved the best overall performance (0.905), followed by ILIs*PR (0.844), and ILIs (0.566). In Chengdu, reported cases consistently exhibited better sensitivity and specificity. Conversely, the performance of ILIs and ILIs*PR was found to be suboptimal, achieving overall Youden Index scores of only 0.49 and 0.74, respectively, as shown in Table 1.

Table 1. Performance of three datasets for the early warning of influenza epidemic in Beijing Municipality and Chengdu City, Sichuan Province, using test sets, 2021–2024. The somewhat reduced specificity observed in reported cases and ILIs*PR can be primarily attributed to the prompt issuance of early warnings, which, in turn, led to a rise in the number of false positives. In scenarios where the prioritization of early warnings is critical, such performance might be deemed beneficial. Notably, an increase in false positives for ILIs was particularly evident during periods of low influenza activity, underscoring that in the presence of co-circulating pathogens, this dataset might not represent the optimal choice (Figure 2). Figure 2. Warning results of the optimal model across three datasets for the early warning of influenza epidemic in Beijing Municipality and Chengdu City, Sichuan Province, 2021–2024. (A) Reported cases in Beijing; (B) Reported cases in Chengdu; (C) ILIs in Beijing; (D) ILIs in Chengdu; (E) ILIs*PR in Beijing; (F) ILIs*PR in Chengdu. Note: This figure shows the performance of the three datasets for the early warning of influenza epidemics. For season 2021–2022, all data before 2021–2022 served as the training set, with data for 2021–2022 as the test set. This approach was consistently followed for subsequent seasons. The gray line represents the 7-day moving average number of corresponding cases. The red dots indicate TP, where the model accurately predicted an impending influenza epidemic; the orange dots represent FP, where the model incorrectly predicted an epidemic; the green dots signify TN, where the model correctly predicted the absence of an epidemic; and the purple dots represent FN, where the model failed to predict an actual influenza epidemic. Reported cases indicate the number of reported cases from the nationwide NIDRIS; ILIs*PR indicates the number of cases of influenza-like illness multiplied by the positivity rate of the influenza virus.Abbreviation: PR=positivity rate; NIDRIS=Notifiable Infectious Diseases Reporting Information System; ILI=influenza-like illness; TP=true positive; FP=false positive; TN=true negative; FN=false negative. DISCUSSION This study revealed that data reported through NIDRIS provided a superior early warning of influenza epidemics in both Beijing and Chengdu, particularly in the presence of concurrent respiratory pathogen co-circulation. This was indicated by the highest Youden index values among the three datasets examined. Since the 2017–2018 and 2018–2019 influenza seasons, Beijing and Chengdu have enhanced the reporting of clinically diagnosed influenza cases within the NIDRIS system. The data from this system demonstrated a robust capability to accurately capture influenza activity, correlating closely with the influenza PR. In contrast, the count of ILI cases exhibited diminished effectiveness as an early warning indicator. This trend was particularly pronounced during the 2022–2023 influenza season, during which the Youden Index in Chengdu dropped below 0.4. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the daily count of ILI cases reported in Beijing closely corresponded with the influenza PRs. However, a marked divergence between ILI case numbers and influenza PRs emerged from 2020 to 2023, a period characterized by the co-circulation of multiple respiratory pathogens including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). This discrepancy was similarly noted in data from the United Kingdom and the United States (10–11). Consequently, ILI counts may be less reliable as indicators of influenza virus activity. Our findings indicate that the dataset created by multiplying the number of reported ILI cases by the influenza PR exhibited strong early warning capabilities. Its performance, as measured by the Youden Index, surpassed that of using ILI counts alone. It appears that, in theory, this dataset could most effectively track daily increments in influenza cases. However, the reliance on laboratory testing data to ascertain PRs constrains its timeliness. To overcome this limitation and enhance the ability to provide real-time alerts, we integrated a predictive model employing LSTM techniques to approximate the most current influenza PRs. This predictive model demonstrated a low MSE, recording values of 0.0012 in Beijing and 0.0059 in Chengdu, which indicates its promising utility for the early detection of influenza outbreaks. This study was subject to several limitations. First, both Beijing and Chengdu enhanced their reporting of influenza cases in NIDRIS starting from 2018, which resulted in a paucity of historical data. This limited dataset may have affected the robustness of optimal model selection in the training sets, potentially impacting the models’ ability to detect epidemics early in the test sets. Second, a significant disparity in the number of sentinel hospitals between Beijing and Chengdu resulted in the early warning models performing better in Beijing, based on reported ILI case numbers. This discrepancy in the daily ILI case reports between the two cities may pose challenges when assessing their performance in early warning using ILI numbers. Third, our study utilized data collected during the COVID-19 pandemic. Nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) were implemented prior to the downgrading of COVID-19 management according to the law on prevention and treatment of infectious disease in China. These interventions could have affected case numbers across the three datasets, thus potentially introducing biases into our analysis. In summary, the NIDRIS, known for its comprehensive national coverage, obligatory reporting, high specificity, and consistent, real-time reporting capabilities, holds promise as a valuable early-warning tool for the onset of influenza epidemics. This is particularly relevant in regions where there is a lack of adequate ILI surveillance systems. As China places an increasing emphasis on early-warning capabilities, improvements in data quality and system informatization of NIDRIS are anticipated. These enhancements are expected to expand its utility in providing early warnings not only for influenza but for other infectious diseases, such as enterovirus infections as well. However, it is crucial to recognize that ILI surveillance remains vital for assessing the impact of concurrent circulation of respiratory pathogens on healthcare resource utilization. Therefore, it continues to provide a critical foundation for informed decision-making in the preparation and allocation of medical supplies and resources.

(KBAK/KBFX) — The Kern County fair is less than two weeks away and, this year there will be a few changes to one popular attraction that has farm animals. The fair has made some adjustments to its dairy area because of confirmed cases of the bird flu in Tulare county.The confirmed cases Avian Influenza (HPA H5N1) has the Kern County Fair working closely with the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA)to determine the best course of action moving forward.The dairy replacement heifer show and sale has been canceled. SIMILAR: Free Kern County Fair tickets for blood, platelet donors amid critical shortageAfter guidance from CFDA on September 5, the Kern County Fair said the following updates are official:The dairy birthing area has been converted into a beef cow-calf viewing area.The 2024 Dairy Replacement Heifer Show and Sale has been canceled.All dairy cattle entered in Division 202 are still eligible to be shown at the 2024 Fair.Dairy cattle will be stalled together based on their place of origin.2025 Springer Futurity Heifers will still be eligible for participation, even if exhibitors choose not to attend.After hearing some criticism online the kern county fair released a new statement Friday afternoon clarifying a few things saying in part...“The Kern County Fair’s decision to adjust the dairy shows stems from critical safety measures tied to the avian influenza (HPAI H5N1) outbreak, which has now affected nearby dairies in the Central Valley. After receiving a letter from the CDFA State Veterinarian, we were informed that the dairy replacement heifer show will be prohibited at the fair this year. This decision was made in coordination with the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) and with the health of our exhibitors, their families, fairgoers, and the dairy industry in mind.”There will be an option to participate in a virtual show."The proper measures are being taken by the California Department of Food and Agriculture," said Lavers Ranch Owner & Operator, Jack Lavers. "All of our state vets are being very proactive, those that are impacted and those who haven’t been impacted yet, are taking all the necessary steps and precautions to make sure that we can stop this from spreading as much as we can. This is just one of those critical steps that we have to do with the fair but unfortunately and I believe that we live in a great county, Kern County, that we can come together to help these kids."Many of these kids lavers is referencing have worked years to prepare their animals for the fair.The Fair says they made the decision with the health of their exhibitors, fairgoers, and the dairy industry in mind."This is a very good thing," said Lavers. "Keep them home, keep them safe and fortunately we live in the greatest county in California, Kern.

(Division of Agriculture image)FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. — While surges in colds, flu, and even COVID may come and go, agricultural producers are always on the lookout for avian influenza — and not just in poultry flocks. In 2024, highly pathogenic avian influenza has been detected not only in birds, but cattle, swine, and humans as well.To address the current state of HPAI, the University of Arkansas System Division of Agriculture’s Center of Excellence for Poultry Science will host the International Avian Influenza and One Health Emerging Issues Summit on Sept. 30 – Oct. 3 at the Don Tyson Center for Agricultural Sciences in Fayetteville, Arkansas.While the general public may be most familiar with the H5N1 strain of HPAI, multiple viruses have infected tens of millions of birds and more than 20 species of mammals worldwide since 2022. In response, event organizers have expanded the scope of this year’s annual summit to address emerging issues affecting cattle, swine, bees, humans and more as part of the “One Health” concept.This year’s summit will feature 55 speakers over four days, more than doubling the number of speakers at the 2023 two-day conference. More than 1,800 individuals from 81 countries registered for the 2023 summit.In-person attendance is limited to 200 people and online attendance is limited to 1,000 participants this year. There is no cost to attend either way, but registration is required. To register, visit https://internationalavianinfluenzasummit.uada.eduegistration/.

This is the aim of the VIVACE project, supported by the Marie Sklodowska-Curie doctoral network action of the Horizon Europe program and coordinated by the Host-Pathogen Interactions Laboratory (IHAP – INRAE/ENVT) at the INRAE Occitanie-Toulouse center. Published on 04 September 2024 illustration Management of avian influenza in a vaccination context © Chloé Le Gall-Ladevèze While outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in Europe used to be rare and geographically contained, the situation has dramatically changed in the last few years with thousands of outbreaks reported in domestic poultry and wild birds.Although this is an area of research on which a large number of teams are working, many unknowns remain. How can we predict the emergence of HPAI, prevent viral spread and limit the socio-economic impact of control measures? Vaccination of domestic poultry against avian influenza is now being given full consideration, as it is becoming clear that traditional prevention and control approaches alone will not curb the accelerating pace of occurrence of devastating HPAIV epidemics.On 1 October 2023, France became the first European Union country to implement a nation-wide vaccination campaign in ducks. However, vaccinating domestic poultry does not come without important epidemiological, virological and economic challenges.The VIVACE project therefore aims to set up a doctoral network - 13 theses (PhD) funded, including 3 at the IHAP laboratory - to contribute to the full integration of poultry vaccination approaches into effective avian influenza management strategies. Combining the disciplines of life sciences, epidemiology, mathematics and social and behavioral sciences, the project's objectives are to:analyze the impact of current and future EU vaccination policies on avian influenza virus evolution and the emergence of zoonotic strains;adapt surveillance strategies and develop improved diagnostic tools;assess the societal impact of HPAI by identifying factors influencing the effectiveness of control measures.The proposed training program includes sessions to acquire scientific and transferable skills. It draws on the integrated added value of complementary expertise (virology, immunology, modelling, spatial and molecular epidemiology, social psychology, economics and politics), and on full access to cutting-edge technologies in excellent research teams and companies.The consortium gathers 15 universities or research institutes and 5 private companies in 8 countries, securing both inter-sectoriality and wide geographic distribution with tailored epidemiological and vaccination contexts.

The case was detected in an adult patient with underlying medical conditions who reported no exposure to animals. The patient was hospitalized Aug. 22 and tested positive for influenza A. According to a Department of Health and Senior Services news release, the patient has recovered and was discharged to return home.When asked where the patient was and is located, a DHSS spokesperson told the News-Leader that additional patient information will not be provided to ensure patient privacy.The case was detected by the DHSS' ongoing influenza surveillance program. As part of the program, the Missouri State Public Health Laboratory conducted additional testing to determine the influenza subtype. The lab's presumptive detection was the H5 subtype. The specimen was then forwarded to the CDC for further testing, which is when the subtype was confirmed.What is avian influenza A or the 'bird flu'?The "H5 bird flu" is a widespread strain of the influenza virus that affects birds worldwide. Though the virus is most common in sick birds, it can also infect humans. This year, dairy cows have experienced an outbreak of the virus nationwide.More: Nationwide, 92M birds have been affected by bird flu. Here's what to know in MissouriHow contagious is 'bird flu'?The current public health risk of the "bird flu" is "low," according to the CDC. The spread of the virus between human to human is "very rare" and when it has happened, "only spread to a few people."However, the CDC is watching the situation closely, taking routine preparedness and prevention measures in case the virus changes to pose a greater risk.The virus can be transmitted through direct contact or an intermediate host, such as another animal. Direct infection can occur from exposure to saliva, mucous or feces from infected birds. People with close or prolonged unprotected contact with infected bird or places that sick birds have contaminated, may be at a higher risk for "bird flu" infection.What are 'bird flu' symptoms?The reported symptoms of the "bird flu" in humans have ranged from no symptoms or mild to severe. According to the CDC, commonly reported symptoms include:Eye rednessMild flu-like upper respiratory symptomsPneumonia requiring hospitalizationFever or feeling feverishCoughSore throatRunny or stuffy noseMuscle or body achesHeadachesFatiqueShortness of breath or difficulty breathingLess common symptoms include diarrhea, nausea, vomiting or seizures.These symptoms are all similar to other respiratory illnesses, including the seasonal flu. People who believe they have been exposed to sick birds and are displaying the common symptoms for the virus should contact their medical provider.Greta Cross is the trending topics reporter for the Springfield News-Leader.

No copayment, deductible needed for preventive benefit \ ﻿8 Medicine Cabinet Essentials for Cold and Flu Season ﻿Keep these items on hand to identify ﻿and treat troubling symptoms Health What You Need to Know About Getting the Flu Shot This Year The vaccine lowers risk of serious symptoms that disproportionately affect older adults By Rachel Nania, AARP Comments En español Published September 03, 2024 / Updated October 04, 2024 Photo Collage: AARP (Source: Shutterstock) Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Even though temperatures are still summerlike in many areas of the country, it’s time to start preparing for the coming cold and flu season. Health officials are predicting that the 2024-2025 respiratory illness season will be similar to last year’s, possibly even better. “That being said, there are a lot of assumptions that go into a projection,” Center﻿s for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Mandy Cohen, M.D., said at an August press briefing. “If those assumptions prove wrong, say, for example, the number of people who ultimately get vaccinated against flu, COVID-19 and RSV is lower than expected, then that could mean more hospitalizations, not fewer.” Newly updated COVID-19 vaccines were recently approved and are making their way to pharmacies and clinics nationwide. Flu shots for the 2024-2025 are also starting to become available and are especially important for older adults who are at higher risk for getting seriously ill if infected. The CDC estimates that between 70 and 85 percent of flu-related deaths in the United States occur among adults 65 and older, and as many as 70 percent of flu-related hospitalizations happen to people in this age group. “Influenza is a serious illness, and people need to be thinking of it as such,” says Mark Rupp, M.D., a professor and chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases in the Department of Internal Medicine at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. But often people don’t think of flu as being as serious as some other diseases, says Kathleen Linder, M.D. a clinical assistant professor of infectious diseases at Michigan Medicine. “I think part of the challenge is that people use the word ‘flu’ to mean a lot of different illnesses,” Linder says. “You hear people talk about the stomach flu, which isn't influenza at all. And I think it's just important to remember that influenza proper can be very, very dangerous. Some of the sickest patients that we see in our ICU are people who have influenza.” Research shows the flu vaccine can lower your risk of hospitalization and death from influenza. Rupp says that on an average year, “there's somewhere around 25,000 deaths in the United States due to influenza that can be very much diminished at risk by getting an influenza vaccine.” Here’s what you need to know about getting the shot this year. 1. The vaccine targets three influenza viruses Similar to the COVID-19 vaccine, the composition of the flu vaccine is updated each year to target stains of the influenza virus that health officials expect will be circulating. This year’s flu shot will be trivalent, meaning it will protect against three different influenza viruses, including H1N1, H3N2 and a B/Victoria lineage virus. The vaccine was found to reduce the risk of hospitalization from flu in high-risk individuals by 35 percent during the southern hemisphere’s 2024 flu season, which typically runs April through September, a new report from the CDC shows. The researchers note that the vaccine’s effectiveness could be similar in the northern hemisphere if similar flu strains circulate during its flu season (October through May).

Older adults need a high-dose version There are different flu vaccine options available, and for people under 65, health officials don’t recommend any licensed vaccine over another. However, adults 65-plus should choose one of the higher-dose vaccines available, the CDC says. The high-dose shots are: Fluzone high-dose vaccineFlublok recombinant flu vaccineFluad adjuvanted flu vaccine “The issue is that as people get older, their immunologic response is not as robust as younger, healthier people,” Rupp says. ﻿ ﻿In order to account for this, he says, you can either get a flu vaccine with a higher antigen level —﻿ a marker that tells the body's immune system that something is harmful ﻿— or that includes an ingredient called adjuvant, which stimulates the immune system to create a stronger immune response. “Both of them are ways in which you can get older people to have an appropriate amount of protection,” Rupp says. These higher-dose shots may result in more of the temporary, mild side effects that you’d expect from a standard-dose flu vaccine, the CDC says. Common side effects from the flu shot can include: Pain, redness or swelling at the injection siteHeadacheFeverNauseaMuscle acheFatigue Vaccine side effects typically disappear after a few days and are normal signs that the body is building protection.

It’s best to be vaccinated by the end of October The best time to get the flu vaccine is in September or October, the CDC says. If you get it too early, say in July or August, you “might run out of immunity by the end of the season,” Linder says. Flu season in the United States typically stretches from October to February, though activity can last as late as May, according to the CDC. It takes about two weeks after you are vaccinated for immunity to fully set in. 4. You can get your flu shot with COVID-19 and RSV vaccines Like last year, the advice from experts this fall is that the flu and COVID-19 vaccines can be given at the same appointment, so there’s no need to make two separate trips to the pharmacy or doctor’s office. You can also get your flu shot with an RSV vaccine, which is recommended just one time for everyone 75 and older and people 60 to 74 with certain health conditions. If you’re due for all three vaccines, it’s fine to get them all at once, the CDC says. You can find flu, COVID-19 and RSV shots near you at vaccines.gov.

During a call hosted by PennAg with stakeholders in the ag industry, Pennsylvania’s state veterinarian, Dr. Alex Hamberg, said efforts are underway to increase cattle surveillance via a voluntary bulk tank monitoring program. In addition, work is being done to establish testing at the milk processor level in multiple states.So far, seven Pennsylvania dairy farms are participating in the bulk tank monitoring program, and more are expected to sign up. While there are no new detections among poultry in Pennsylvania and no cases of HPAI in dairy cattle in the state, Hamberg cautioned the risk will rise as the fall migration begins.“It is critical if it does come to Pennsylvania that we detect it early and stamp it out,” he said. “It’s bad for poultry, but also bad for cattle.”Nan Hanshaw, chief of the Animal Health Division at the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture, said the recent case in California involved a large dairy operation with farms in other states. The cause of the outbreak, she said, is not wild birds but rather transporting cattle from one farm to another.The current influenza strain impacting dairy cattle can also be found in wild birds, however. Dr. Chrislyn Wood, a USDA veterinary medical officer, said wild birds have been found in close proximity to the dairy herds that tested positive for the virus. But testing in areas outside of the positive locations has yet to find the particular strain in wild birds.“There’s no indication wild birds are spreading this,” Wood said. “It seems to be movement of dairy cattle or people.”With two major livestock shows coming up in Pennsylvania - All American Dairy Show, Sept. 14-18 and the Keystone International Livestock Exposition on Sept. 27 through Oct. 6 - Hanshaw said surveillance efforts will be increased.Both shows will be held at the Farm Show Complex in Harrisburg, and Hanshaw said specific protocols will be in place before cattle can even enter the parking lot. Also, all lactating cattle must have a negative influenza test prior to the shows. Officials have the right to shut down either show if HPAI is detected, she added.Hanshaw also provided an update on the HPAI Recovery Reimbursement Grant program, which is still available. There is a $25,000 cap per farm, she said, and so far 82 applications have been received, totaling $1.5 million. The grant program has also been extended an additional 90 days to the end of the year.

Here’s the best time to get your annual vaccineBYLindsey LeakeSeptember and October are ideal flu vaccination periods for most people, who need only a single dose each season, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Violeta Stoimenova—Getty ImagesThe autumnal equinox may be three weeks away, but fall’s unofficial arrival has already ushered in the updated, 2024–25 flu vaccines. An influenza virus can make you ill any time of year. What we think of as the seasonal flu in the U.S., however, usually spreads throughout the fall and winter, peaking between December and February, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Even though vaccines can stave off severe infection, hospitalization, and death, their protection declines over time. That said, you may be wondering, When is the best time to get my annual flu shot? September and October are ideal flu vaccination periods for most people, who need only a single dose each season, the CDC says. Your state or local health department may have chartered a “vaccine before Halloween” or “flu before boo” campaign to encourage people in your community to get immunized ahead of November. The CDC recommends an annual flu shot for everyone ages 6 months and older; high-dose and adjuvanted vaccines are available to adults 65 and older. “For older adults and for folks who’ve got chronic medical problems, I usually recommend getting the flu vaccine around anytime from the middle of September through early October,” Dr. Robert Hopkins Jr., medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, tells Fortune. “Because in those of us with immune systems that aren’t quite as robust, we want to make sure that we vaccinate at a time that’s likely to give us immune protection throughout the flu season.” By getting yourself vaccinated against the flu, you’re also helping limit infection spread to the most vulnerable members of your community, says Dr. Michael Ben-Aderet, associate medical director of hospital epidemiology at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. “Every year in this country we have thousands and thousands of patients who are hospitalized and die with influenza, and they are particularly older people or people with medical illness,” Ben-Aderet tells Fortune. “It is beneficial to those people and everyone else that we get the flu vaccine.” Whenever you choose to get your updated flu vaccine, keep in mind that it takes as much as two weeks for your body to build up immunity to the virus. Is it ever too late in the year to get a flu shot? From 1982–83 through 2021–22, seasonal flu activity peaked 17 times in February, followed by seven in December and six in January, CDC records show. But it also peaked six times in March and once in April; though less common, early spring flu peaks do happen. In addition, the CDC notes that COVID has rendered the timing and duration of flu activity less predictable. Flu vaccination before November is ideal, but any time you’re able to get a dose throughout the season is better than no protection at all, Hopkins says. “Get it as soon as you can, and it’s not too late,” Hopkins says. “If you’ve got virus circulating in your community, get the vaccine, because that may help reduce the severity of your infection, even if it doesn’t necessarily prevent infection because you got it a little late.” No, the flu vaccine doesn’t give you the flu Some people feel sick after getting vaccinated, enough to perpetuate the myth that immunizations such as the flu and COVID vaccines give you those respective viruses. But regardless of when in the season you get your flu shot, getting it annually should minimize side effects over time, explains Dr. Priya Sampathkumar, an infectious disease specialist at the Mayo Clinic. “If you’ve not had the flu vaccine in a while, or if you’re getting the high-dose flu vaccine, you do get a sore arm, you can get generalized muscle aches and pains, you can get a low-grade fever, you can get a headache,” Sampathkumar tells Fortune. “These are all signs that your body is responding to the vaccine and not really the flu. The more frequently you get flu vaccines—if you get them year after year—you generally don’t have any of these side effects at all.” Some children, pregnant people can get flu shot in summer The CDC considers July and August too early for the general population to get an annual flu shot. Pregnant people in their third trimester, though, are encouraged to get immunized during these summer months; vaccine-induced protection extends to their infants, who won’t be eligible for a shot of their own until they reach 6 months of age. Children under 5, particularly those under 2, are at high risk of severe influenza infection and may get vaccinated as soon as doses are available—even before September. Children 8 and under with fewer than two lifetime flu vaccine doses require two doses of the new vaccine, four weeks apart. The CDC recommends these young children get their first dose in the summer. Your child’s pediatrician can help you determine an ideal dosing schedule. Pre-September vaccination is too early for adults 65 and older, as well as pregnant people in their first or second trimesters, the CDC says. However, people who would otherwise be unable to get vaccinated in September or October—those traveling abroad, for instance—may consider summer immunization.

The millions of wild birds killed includes tens of thousands of endangered and endemic species – and tens of thousands of mammals have died too.Today, new data, published in Nature Communications, documents the disease’s spread to the southernmost tip of the planet – the Antarctic region – where it has inflicted significant die-offs in elephant seals and fur seals. This outbreak has affected every continent except Oceania, and yet there has been little coverage of the impact on global biodiversity and farming systems – or of potential risks to human health.“I’m not sure the public is aware of the significance of the avian influenza,” said lead author Prof Ashley Banyard, a virologist at the UK’s Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) lab in Weybridge, Surrey. “It’s not been front-page news.”Experts are racing to find out more about the disease and understand where it might go next. “We can’t rest on our laurels … we have to make sure we are continually monitoring and tracking the threat from avian influenza viruses,” said Banyard. “It’s almost impossible for me to predict what’s going to flare up where.”Dr Connor Bamford, an assistant professor in virology from Queen’s University Belfast, said there could be further surprises. “One major open space for the virus remains the human population.”Bird flu has affected wild species in every continent except Oceania:Notable mass mortality events between 2021 and 2024, approximate numbersHow did it start?The bird flu variant that caused these deaths is more than a quarter of a century old. Highly pathogenic H5N1 was first reported in China in 1996, when it was found at a goose farm. The origins of all highly pathogenic avian influenzas – the ones that cause severe disease and death – have been tracked back to poultry farms.“The history of [bird flu strain] 2.3.4.4b goes back before we noticed these mass die-offs of wild birds,” said Bamford. “But something seemed to happen in 2021.” That is when the strain became the dominant bird flu virus globally, and is now highly pathogenic and highly contagious.What does an outbreak look like?The ornithologist Peter Stronach was among the first people in the UK to witness the unfolding disaster in the breeding bird population. On 11 May 2022, he was walking along thebeach at Littleferry in Scotland, a walk he had done often, to watch birds flying overhead. But that day was different: “There were just corpses of birds scattered along the high tide line,” he said.In total, Stronach counted 72 dead birds, including puffin, guillemot and great skua. The virus had killed birds from 17 different species, the first time several species had been killed in summertime (rather than overwintering species). “That’s really unusual. It signalled something was wrong,” he said.As the season wore on “everything escalated”, said Stronach. Fishers were reporting carcasses of birds far out at sea. “Doing some primitive maths we were able to work out huge numbers were involved and no one was monitoring it.”In the coming months, tens of thousands of seabirds would die. The virus survived the summer in Europe and quickly went global, spreading along bird migration routes.View image in fullscreenNational Trust rangers clear the bodies of birds from Staple Island, Northumberland, UK, where bird flu is devastating one of the UK’s most important seabird colonies. Photograph: Owen Humphreys/PAWhat has the toll been?Bird flu has caused the most significant and sudden loss of birds in decades, with some of the long-lived seabird species likely to take several years to recover. It has led to the death and mass slaughter of more than 280 million poultry birds since October 2021, based on data from the World Animal Health Information System. There is no total figure for wild bird deaths, though it is estimated to be in the millions.It has been particularly destructive in species of birds with a small geographic spread. The first big outbreak in the winter of 2021 was among the Svalbard barnacle geese in the Solway Firth where at least 13,000 birds died: a third of the global population of that species. In March 2022, more than 2,200 dalmatian pelicans died in Greece, or 40% of the south-east European population. The UK, which is home to most nesting great skua pairs, has lost three-quarters of those on surveyed sites since bird flu struck, according to a study published in February. Across Europe, more than 20,000 sandwich terns died during the 2022 breeding season– or 17% of the population in north-west Europe – in an outbreak that killed almost all chicks within colonies. In total it has killed birds from 320 species, and mammals from dozens of species.How does it spread?One bird can infect as many as 100, with the virus present in faeces, mucus, blood and saliva. A teaspoon of faeces is enough to kill an entire house of chickens or turkeys, experts say, with mortality rates of up to 100%.Where has it been detected?Australia and New Zealand are the only places still free of outbreaks among wild birds. In November 2021, the first case in North America was recorded in Newfoundland, Canada, probably carried by a bird migrating from northwest Europe along the East Atlantic flyway. By mid-2022, more than 230 outbreaks had been recorded in wild animals, and it had spread throughout Canada and the US.In October 2022 it arrived in South America. Data suggests there were three separate introductions. It spread the length of the continent (6,000km) in less than six months, arriving in Tierra del Fuego in April 2023. In total more than 500,000 wild birds have died in South America.In October 2023, bird flu arrived on the sub-Antarctic island of South Georgia. In total it has killed animals from about 10 species in the Antarctic region (most of them on South Georgia), including fur seals, elephant seals and gentoo penguins.Researchers warned of large geographic “black boxes” where it is not known whether there is bird flu in wild populations, particularly in parts of Africa and Asia.“It’s pretty unclear what’s happened in Asia and Africa. If you do look, it is there, but it has not been well tracked,” said Bamford.There are endemic strains in Bangladesh and Cambodia. Japan has recorded recent cases in large-billed crows; South Korea has reported it in whooper swans. Studies from west and south Africa confirm cases there: since January 2022, Burkina Faso has recorded 133 outbreaks, including three in wild birds. In early 2023, thousands of seabird deaths were recorded in Senegal, Gambia and Guinea-Bissau, including caspian terns, royal terns and grey-headed gulls.What about other animals? In South America, bird flu caused mass die-offs of mammals. More than 20,000 South American sea lions died in Chile and Peru, which is 9% of the regional population. An estimated 17,000 southern elephant seal pups died in Argentina – equivalent to 96% of all pups born in the country in 2023. This amounts to the loss of nearly an entire generation of seals, which take at least three years to reach maturity.In March this year, bird flu started spreading among US cattle. It is the first time a bird flu virus has been found in cows, with more than 100 herds affected and probably more that have not yet been reported.Poultry operations near farms have also reported cases, suggesting the virus may be spilling back into birds. Barn cats and mice have also tested positive for H5N1 so they could spread the virus out of farms into the wider environment.View image in fullscreenA sea lion on Chepeconde beach, amid rising cases of bird flu infections, in Lima, Peru. Photograph: Sebastian Castañeda/ReutersWhat is the risk to humans?As the virus evolves, it could become more of a threat to people, according to a recent report by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). There have been nine cases of H5N1 in humans in the US (although symptoms have been relatively mild) and officials said they expected to see more. “The more infections there are among cows, the more risk there is for infections to occur among humans,” said Dr Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the CDC.The UN health agency’s chief scientist has also said the risk of bird flu spreading to humans is an “enormous concern”. So far, there is no evidence that H5N1 is spreading between humans. But in the hundreds of cases where humans have been infected through contact with animals over the past 20 years the mortality rate is above 50%.What’s next?In October 2023, bird flu arrived in the Antarctic region. Researchers on the ground have counted hundreds of carcasses of dead seals in South Georgia. But it is a big area with few eyes on the ground.“It could be that the number we detect is only a fraction of the number that have actually died,” said Norman Ratcliffe, a bird ecologist at the British Antarctic Survey (BAS), who has worked on penguins and seabirds on South Georgia.Although it has killed gentoo and king penguins, losses among penguins have been relatively small. “There is cause for optimism. It’s not as bad as we thought it could be when we saw the first cases,” said Ratcliffe.Generally, viruses evolve in a way that means they do not kill their hosts – they tend to become less dangerous and more transmissible over time. The virus has also travelled around the whole world, so it has little new territory to cover – except for Oceania.“Predicting the future of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus is one of the biggest challenges facing the field,” according to Bamford. “It is possible this season could be less affected due to a build up of immunity in wild birds who were infected and survived in the preceding seasons. However, we continue to detect the virus in European birds sporadically so we should expect to see further outbreaks.”Explore more on these topicsBird fluThe age of extinctionHealthexplainersShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedEnvironmentClimate crisisWildlifeEnergyPollutionNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveTax strategyFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInXNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Chickens wait in a cage at the Chicken Market due to bird flu infection.Getty Images Timeline September 6The first case of the bird flu with “no immediate known animal exposure” was confirmed in a Missouri resident who was hospitalized, recovered and had no known work-related exposure to sick animals, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention—the Missouri Department of Health & Senior Services reported the infection was detected as part of the state’s standard flu surveillance system, unlike the targeted H5N1 surveillance program that has typically surveyed farm workers. August 30Three dairies in central California detected the bird flu virus among its herds and have been quarantined, according to the California Department of Food and Agriculture, which noted there are no human bird flu cases related to the incident, as well as no threat to the milk and food supply. August 29The July bird flu outbreaks in two Colorado poultry facilities were the country’s first known human cluster of cases caused by poultry—infections were just one-off in the past—though there was no reported human-to-human transmission, according to a new report by the CDC. July 25Three more human infections were confirmed in workers from a second Colorado poultry facility, bringing the country’s total case count to 14 since 2022, according to CDC data. July 24A new Nature study found bird flu spread among cows in the U.S., and the animals also spread the virus to cats and raccoons; this is one of the first studies confirming mammal-to-mammal bird flu transmission. July 19The CDC confirmed an additional two bird flu cases in poultry farm workers from the same facility in Colorado, bringing the country’s total human case count to 11. July 15Officials confirmed a fourth bird flu case in a poultry farm worker on the same Colorado farm from last week, and a fifth suspected case is pending confirmation from the CDC. This brings the national number to nine since the first human cases was detected in the state in 2022, with eight of the cases reported this year. July 12Colorado authorities announced three workers in a commercial egg operation have presumptive positive cases of bird flu, bringing the state’s count of known human infections up to as high as five—and the national number to seven—though authorities said none of the workers have been hospitalized, and showed “common respiratory infection symptoms” and pink eye. It’s the first time multiple cases have been recorded at the same location. July 3Colorado health officials confirmed the state’s second human case of bird flu in a dairy farm worker who has since recovered and only had mild symptoms, reporting pink eye. June 25Finland said it plans to begin vaccinating vulnerable populations like farm workers against bird flu as early as next week using 10,000 vaccine series—each with two doses—acquired as part of a European Union deal with vaccine maker CSL Seqirus to provide up to 40 million vaccines to 15 countries. June 11The World Health Organization announced a four-year-old child in India was infected with H9N2 bird flu—a different flu strain from H5N1—but recovered after suffering from seizures, respiratory distress, fever and abdominal cramps; H9N2 has infected around 100 people globally since 1998, and this is the second human case in India. June 6Dozens of cows infected with bird flu have either died or been slaughtered in Colorado, Ohio, Michigan, South Carolina and Texas, which is unusual since—unlike poultry—cows cost more to slaughter and around 90% usually make a full recovery, Reuters reported. June 5A new study examining the 2023 bird flu outbreak in South America that killed around 17,400 elephant seal pups and 24,000 sea lions found the disease spread between the animals in several countries, the first known case of transnational virus mammal-to-mammal bird flu transmission. May 30Another human case of bird flu has been detected in a dairy farm worker in Michigan—though the cases aren’t connected—and this is the first person in the U.S. to report respiratory symptoms connected to bird flu, though their symptoms are “resolving,” according to the CDC. May 23A new study with mice suggests that drinking infected milk can spread the disease—and that a certain type of pasteurization may not always be effective in killing the virus. May 22Michigan reported bird flu in a farmworker—the second U.S. human case tied to transmission from dairy cows—though the worker had a mild infection and has since recovered. May 21Australia reported its first human case of bird flu after a child became infected in March after traveling to India, though the child has since recovered after suffering from a “severe infection,” according to the Victorian Department of Health. May 16The USDA conducted a study, and discovered that after high levels of the virus was injected into beef, no trace was left after the meat was cooked medium to well done, though the virus was found in meat cooked to lower temperatures. May 14The CDC released influenza A waste water data for the weeks ending in April 27 and May 4, and found several states like Alaska, California, Florida, Illinois and Kansas had unusually high levels, though the agency isn’t sure if the virus came from humans or animals, and isn’t able to differentiate between influenza A subtypes, meaning the H5N1 virus or other subtypes may have been detected. May 10The Food and Drug Administration announced it will commit an additional $8 million to ensure the commercial milk supply is safe, while the Department of Agriculture said it will pay up to $28,000 per farm to help mitigate the spread of the disease, totaling around $98 million in funds. May 9Some 70 people in Colorado are being monitored for bird flu due to potential exposure, and will be tested for the virus if they show any symptoms, the Colorado Department of Public Health told Forbes—it was not immediately clear how or when the people were potentially exposed. May 1The Department of Agriculture said it tested 30 grocery store ground beef products for bird flu and they all came back negative, reaffirming the meat supply is safe. May 1The Food and Drug Administration confirmed dairy products are still safe to consume, announcing it tested grocery store samples of products like infant formula, toddler milk, sour cream and cottage cheese, and no live traces of the bird flu virus were found, although some dead remnants were found in some of the food—though none in the baby products. April 30Wenqing Zhang, head of WHO's Global Influenza Programme, said during a news briefing "there is a risk for cows in other countries to be getting infected," with the bird flu virus, since it’s commonly spread through the movement of migratory birds. April 29The Department of Agriculture told Forbes it will begin testing ground beef samples from grocery stores in states with cow outbreaks, and test ground beef cooked at different temperatures and infected with the virus to determine if it's safe to eat. April 24The USDA said cow-to-cow transmission may be occurring due to the cows coming into contact with raw milk—and warned against humans and other animals, including pets, consuming unpasteurized milk to prevent potential infection. April 18Jeremy Farrar, chief scientist for the World Health Organization, said during a press conference the threat of bird flu spreading between humans was a “great concern,” since it’s evolved and has increasingly been infecting mammals (on land and sea), which means it could possibly spread to humans. April 1The CDC reported the second U.S. human case of bird flu in a Texas dairy farmer who became infected after contracting the virus from infected dairy cows, but said the person was already recovering.

Bird flu doesn’t “transmit easily from person-to-person,” according to the World Health Organization. Bird flu rarely affects humans, and most previous cases came from close contact with infected poultry, according to the CDC. Because human-to-human spread of bird flu poses “pandemic potential,” each human case is investigated to rule out this type of infection. Though none have been confirmed, there are a few global cases—none in the U.S.—where human-to-human transmission of bird flu was thought to be “probable,” including in China, Thailand, Indonesia and Pakistan. Is Bird Flu Fatal To Humans? It is very deadly. Between January 2003 and March 28, 2024 there have been 888 human cases of bird flu infection in humans, according to a report by the World Health Organization. Of those 888 cases, 463 (52%) died. To date, only two people in the U.S. have contracted H5N1 bird flu, and they both were infected after coming into contact with sick animals. The most recent case was a dairy worker in Texas who became ill in March after interacting with sick dairy cows, though he only experienced pink eye. The first incident happened in 2022 when a person in Colorado contracted the disease from infected poultry, and fully recovered. Is It Safe To Drink Milk Infected With Bird Flu? Raw, unpasteurized milk is unsafe to drink, but pasteurized milk is fine, according to the FDA. Bird flu has been detected in both unpasteurized and pasteurized milk, but the FDA recommends manufacturers against making and selling unpasteurized milk since there’s a possibility consuming it may cause bird flu infection. However, the virus remnants in pasteurized milk have been deactivated by the heat during the pasteurization process, so this type of milk is still believed safe to consume. Is It Safe To Consume Meat Infected With Bird Flu? The CDC warns against eating raw meat or eggs from animals “confirmed or suspected” of having bird flu because of the possibility of transmission. However, no human has ever been infected with bird flu from eating properly prepared and cooked meat, according to the agency. The possibility of infected meat entering the food supply is “extremely low” due to rigorous inspection, so properly handled and cooked meat is safe to eat, according to the USDA. To know when meat is properly cooked, whole beef cuts must be cooked to an internal temperature of 145 degrees Fahrenheit, ground meat must be 160 degrees and poultry must be cooked to 165 degrees. Rare and medium rare steaks fall below this temperature. Properly cooked eggs with an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit kills bacteria and viruses including bird flu, according to the CDC. “It doesn’t matter if they may or may not have [avian] influenza… runny eggs and rare pieces of meat” are never recommended, Francisco Diez-Gonzalez, director and professor for the Center for Food Safety at the University of Georgia, told Forbes. To “play it safe,” consumers should only eat fully cooked eggs and make sure “the yolks are firm with no runny parts,” Daisy May, veterinary surgeon with U.K.-based company Medivet, said. What Are Bird Flu Symptoms In Humans? Symptoms of bird flu include a fever, cough, headache, chills, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, runny nose, congestion, sore throat, nausea or vomiting, diarrhea, pink eye, muscle aches and headache. However, the CDC advises it can’t be diagnosed based on symptoms alone, and laboratory testing is needed. This typically includes swabbing the nose or throat (the upper respiratory tract), or the lower respiratory tract for critically ill patients. How Is Bird Flu Affecting Egg Prices? This year’s egg prices have increased as production decreased due to bird flu outbreaks among poultry, according to the USDA. A dozen large, grade A eggs in the U.S. costed around $2.99 in March, up almost a dollar from the fall. However, this price is down from a record $4.82 in January 2023, which was also spiked by bird flu outbreaks. Earlier this month, Cal-Maine Foods—the country’s largest egg producer—temporarily halted egg production after over one million egg-laying hens and chickens were killed after being infected with bird flu. Why Do Poultry Farmers Kill Chickens With Bird Flu? Once chickens have been infected with bird flu, farmers quickly kill them to help control the spread of the virus, since bird flu is highly contagious and fatal in poultry. The USDA pays farmers for all birds and eggs that have to be killed because of bird flu, as an incentive to responsibly try and curb the spread of the disease. The USDA has spent over $1 billion in bird flu compensation for farmers since 2022, according to the nonprofit Food & Environment Reporting Network. Is There A Vaccine For The Bird Flu (h5n1)? The FDA has approved a few bird flu vaccines for humans. The U.S. has a stockpile of vaccines for H5N1 bird flu, but it wouldn’t be enough to vaccinate all Americans if an outbreak were to happen among humans. If a human outbreak does occur, the government plans to mass produce vaccines, which can take at least six months to make enough for the entire population. CSL Seqirus, the maker of one of the approved vaccines, expects to have 150 million vaccines ready within six months of an announcement of a human bird flu pandemic. Although there are approved vaccines for other variants designed for birds, there are none for the H5N1 variant circulating. However, the USDA began trials on H5N1 animal-specific vaccines in 2023. Key Background As of May 30, more than 92 million poultry (primarily chickens) in 48 states have been euthanized because of bird flu since 2022, and 57 dairy cow herds across nine states have tested positive, according to data from the CDC (unlike chickens, cows appear to recover from the virus). The USDA believes wild migratory birds are the original source of the cow outbreaks that recently has experts concerned it may mutate and spread more easily in humans, though the CDC said its risk to the public remains low. Farrar called the cattle infections in the U.S. a “huge concern,” urging public health officials to continue closely monitoring the situation “because it may evolve into transmitting in different ways.” The increased number of mammal bird flu infections since 2022 “could indicate that the virus is looking for new hosts, and of course, moving closer to people,” Andrea Garcia, vice president of science, medicine and public health for the American Medical Association, said. The first report of a walrus dying from bird flu was detected in April on one of Norway’s Arctic Islands, and the first U.S. dolphin infected with bird flu died back in 2022, according to a report published April 18. More than 10 human bird flu cases were reported to the World Health Organization in 2023, and all but one survived. Bird flu has devastated bird populations, and 67 countries reported the deaths of 131 million poultry in 2022 alone. Although bird flu typically infects wild birds and poultry, it’s spread to other animals during the outbreak, and at least 10 countries have reported outbreaks in mammals since 2022. Around 17,400 elephant seal pups died from bird flu in Argentina in 2023, and at least 24,000 sea lions died in South America the same year. Besides cattle, bird flu has been detected in over 200 other mammals—like seals, raccoons and bears—in the U.S. since 2022. Although rare, even domestic pets like dogs and cats are susceptible to the virus, and the FDA warns against giving unpasteurized milk to cats to avoid possible transmission. Tangent On June 5, WHO confirmed the first human death of a strain of bird flu that’s never before been seen in humans and is separate from H5N1. A 59-year-old man in Mexico contracted H5N2, and died on April 24 after being hospitalized and developing a fever, diarrhea, nausea, shortness of breath and general discomfort. Cases of H5N2 have been reported in poultry in Mexico, but the man had no history with poultry or animals, WHO said. It’s unclear how he became infected. He was bedridden for weeks prior to the infection, and suffered from several other health conditions.

Those included:Saskatchewan: One great horned owl and one Canada gooseBritish Columbia: Four dunlin, one cackling goose, one American crow and one merlinOntario: One great horned owl “Wildlife surveillance as well as the Canadian Avian Influenza Surveillance System (CanNAISS) activities for poultry are ongoing in Canada. According to Article 10.4.1.4. of the Terrestrial Animal Health Code, Member Country should not impose bans on the international trade of poultry commodities in response to notification of infection with any Influenza A viruses in birds other than poultry,” the WOAH report stated.Current HPAI situation with Canadian poultryThe Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) tracks cases of HPAI in commercial and backyard poultry, as well as non-commercial domestic birds not classified as poultry.The most recent of any of those cases was reported on April 10 in a non-commercial flock in Haut-Saint-François Regional County Municipality, Quebec. However, the last time the presence of HPAI was confirmed in a commercial poultry flock was February 19, 2024, with that case occurring in Mountain View County, Alberta.Only one HPAI primary control zone remains active in Canada. That zone involves a premises in Meadow Lake, Saskatchewan, where the presence of HPAI was found in a backyard poultry flock on November 15, 2023.View our continuing coverage of the global avian influenza situation.

The study was done by an important group of UK, Australian scientists, and from the Falklands, Zoe Fowler, who during the summers of 2022 and 2023 tracked and researched infected avian species. Basically conclusions on the outbreaks point to migratory species from South America Accordingly the report “demonstrate the expansion of the geographical distribution area of this disease and highlight the potential ecological impact and threat it poses to wildlife living in this remote location”. The full study with migration maps can be looked up at “Detection and spread of high pathogenicity avian influenza virus H5N1 in the Antarctic Region”, in Nature Communications.

News Missouri’s first case of bird flu confirmed by the CDC by: Dillon Seckington Posted: Sep 6, 2024 / 03:26 PM CDT Updated: Sep 6, 2024 / 08:51 PM CDT by: Dillon Seckington Posted: Sep 6, 2024 / 03:26 PM CDT Updated: Sep 6, 2024 / 08:51 PM CDT SHARE KANSAS CITY, Mo. — The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirms that there has been a human case of bird flu (avian influenza A) detected by the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services (DHSS). This is the first human case detected in the state, and DHSS claims the threat to the general public remains low. DHSS says that the case was identified through its ongoing influenza surveillance program. FOX4 Forecast: Cool sunshine The Missouri State Public Health Laboratory received a specimen from a patient who had been hospitalized on August 22. This patient had underlying conditions and tested positive for influenza A. They also reported no exposure to animals. The patient then recovered and was sent home. The laboratory then conducted more tests to determine the influenza subtype. While completing these tests, the H5 subtype, also known as bird flu, was detected. The specimen was then sent to the CDC for additional testing, and the H5 subtype was confirmed. The H5 subtype is usually found in wild birds, poultry and recently dairy cows. It can occasionally infect humans who have had close contact with infected animals or environments. This is the 15th case reported in the U.S. since 2022, no infection has been reported in dairy cows, but cases in birds and poultry have been reported.

Influenza activity in the 2023 to 2024 season was more prolonged than the 2022 to 2023 season, but peak activity was lower. Across most indicators cumulative burden estimates were lower in the 2023 to 2024 season than in the 2022 to 2023 season. The influenza epidemic wave in the England, Scotland and Wales was characterised by an initial peak in activity in weeks 51 and 52 2023, followed by temporary decrease and subsequent increase in activity which peaked between weeks 4 and 5 2024. This activity pattern is most likely explained by a temporary decrease in social contacts and changes in healthcare seeking behaviour during the holidays. In Northern Ireland, there was a single peak in week 4 2024. Influenza A predominated, with co-circulation of the A(H3N2) and A(H1N1)pdm09 subtypes. Influenza B type Victoria lineage circulated at low levels and became more prominent in 2024 as influenza A declined. All characterised viruses belonged to the same genetic clades as the vaccine strains. Across nations, the influenza hospitalisation rate peaked between week 51 2023 and week 4 2024. Peak hospitalisation rates were lower than the previous influenza season. Intensive care unit (ICU) or high dependency unit (HDU) influenza admissions across nations peaked between week 52 2023 and week 6 2024. Rates were lower than observed in the 2022 to 2023 season. Modelling of influenza-attributable mortality in England estimated approximately 2,776 deaths due to influenza, compared to 15,465 in the previous season. Provisional estimates of influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) against laboratory confirmed influenza in primary care across age groups ranged between 46% and 54%. Effectiveness against hospitalisation ranged from 30% in those of age 65 and above to 74% in those between 2 and 17 years of age. Across eligible groups, influenza vaccine uptake in the UK was generally lower in the 2023 to 2024 season compared to the 2022 to 2023 season. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) Overall RSV activity was consistent with the 2022 to 2023 season and recent pre-pandemic seasons. RSV activity overall peaked around weeks 46 2023 (Scotland and Northern Ireland) to 48 2023 (England) across the UK. Several surveillance systems indicated a bimodal peak, with one peak in between weeks 46 and 48 driven by children below the age of 5, and a second peak between weeks 51 and 52 leading to hospitalisation rates peaking driven by adults aged 65 years and above. Other non SARS-CoV-2 respiratory pathogens Rhinovirus, parainfluenza, adenovirus and human metapneumovirus all showed activity consistent with expected seasonal patterns. Background Surveillance of influenza and other seasonal respiratory viruses in the 4 UK nations is undertaken throughout the year by teams within the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), Public Health Scotland (PHS), Public Health Wales (PHW) and the Public Health Agency (PHA) Northern Ireland, who are each responsible for monitoring influenza activity for their respective nation. UKHSA undertakes a combination of England and UK functions and collated this annual report in collaboration with the other public health agencies. Outputs on influenza are normally published weekly during the winter season between October (week 40) and May (week 20), the period when influenza typically circulates. Since 2020 these reports have also covered COVID-19. This report describes influenza activity observed in the UK in the period generally from week 40 2023 (week ending 8 October 2023) to week 14 2024 (week ending 7 April 2024). Data beyond this point is not considered so that contributors are certain the latest data points are not subject to reporting delays. Of note, there was some limited influenza B activity beyond week 14 2024 across the UK. Details can be found in the weekly reports for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Devolved administrations are separately responsible for monitoring influenza with their own systems. Although systems across nations are very similar, the differences between these systems preclude combining data to a single national estimate. Surveillance of influenza and other respiratory viruses continues year-round with reduced reporting for weeks 21 to 39. Community surveillance Syndromic surveillance England In England, national UKHSA real-time syndromic surveillance systems include GP in-hours (GPIH) consultations and GP out-of-hours (GPOOH) contacts, emergency department (ED) attendances (Emergency Department Syndromic Surveillance System (EDSSS)) and NHS 111 calls and online assessments. These systems monitor a range of indicators sensitive to community influenza activity, for example NHS 111 ‘cold or flu’ calls and GP in-hours consultations for influenza-like illness (ILI). Coding and healthcare seeking behaviour may change over time and particular caution should be taken in comparing pre-pandemic, intra-pandemic and post-pandemic time periods. Both clinical coding and healthcare-seeking behaviour have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Syndromic data over the 2019 to 2020, 2020 to 2021 and 2021 to 2022 winter seasons should therefore be interpreted with some caution. Furthermore, during the 2022 to 2023 season, syndromic surveillance data should also be interpreted with some caution due to the ‘group A strep incident’ from week 48 2022. During this incident, national media reports of an increase in severe invasive group A streptococcus (iGAS) disease in children led to changes in healthcare-seeking behaviour across the NHS, particularly in children with GAS-type symptoms, which are likely to have been respiratory symptoms. GPIH consultation data presented here represents the findings from a sentinel surveillance system, as reported throughout the most recent 6 influenza seasons. The levels (consultation rates) reported may differ from those presented in previous annual reports, which were based on a dual data feed system with a larger population coverage which ended in March 2021. During the winter 2023 to 2024 season, GPIH ILI consultation rates increased from week 47 2023, peaking during week 51 2023 (7.3 consultations per 100,000 population) and again in week 5 2024 (8.6 consultations per 100,000 population). This peak at comparable time points with previous pre-pandemic years but was broadly lower than in those years (Figure 1). In the 2022 to 2023 season there was only one peak in week 51. Rates presented for weeks 52 and week 1 should be interpreted with caution as in those weeks there are less in-hour consultations due to the national holidays. Figure 1. Weekly all age GP in-hours consultations for influenza-like illness (ILI), winter 2017 to 2024, England [note 1] [note 1] Data from seasons 2020 to 2021 and 2021 to 2022 has been removed as there was low activity throughout these seasons. Emergency department (ED) attendance syndromic surveillance data presented here includes 100 EDs (NHS type 1) that reported data throughout the most recent 6 influenza seasons. Therefore, numbers may differ slightly from those presented in previous annual reports, where a different number of EDs were included. Acute respiratory infection (ARI) ED attendances increased gradually from week 41, peaked in week 52 2023 and again in weeks 4 to 6, and stabilized around 13,000 weekly attendances (Figure 2). The ARI indicator is a composite for respiratory diagnoses that follow below. Some caution is needed in interpreting attendances around week 52 2023 and week 1 2024 as increased attendances may be explained by less availability of primary care services due to bank holidays. Figure 2. Weekly ED attendances for ARI by season, England ILI ED attendances increased from week 48, showed 2 peaks in week 52 2023 and week 5 2024 and then gradually declined (Figure 3). Overall attendances were lower than in the previous season (17,535 attendances in the 2022 to 2023 season versus 10,873 attendances in the 2023 to 2024 season). Figure 3. Weekly ED attendances for ILI by season, England Pneumonia ED attendances gradually increased from week 40 2023, peaked in week 52 and stabilized at higher attendances than in previous seasons from week 3 2024 (Figure 4). Figure 4. Weekly ED attendances for pneumonia by season, England Acute bronchiolitis ED attendances were already rising in week 40 2023, peaked in week 47, decline steadily and stabilized around week 3 2024 (Figure 5). Figure 5. Weekly ED attendances for acute bronchiolitis by season, England In England, weekly 111 calls for ARI increased gradually in week 49 and peaked in week 52 2023. As with ED attendances, increases in weeks 52 and week 1 2024 should be interpreted with caution as patterns of health care use may change due to less availability of in-hour GP services (Figure 6). Please note that recent updates to the NHS Pathways clinical tool used by NHS 111 have affected the reported levels of certain syndromic indicators. As a result of these changes, the cold and flu indicator has been removed from this report and replaced with a generic ‘acute respiratory infections’ calls indicator. The ‘acute respiratory infections’ indicator is based on a broad group of symptoms/provisional diagnoses that may be indicative of acute respiratory infections including, for example, influenza-like illness, otitis media, pharyngitis. Figure 6. Weekly 111 calls for acute respiratory infection by season, England Scotland In Scotland, proportion of calls due to cold and flu increased from week 49 2023 and peaked in week 52 2023 and then gradually declined (Figure 7). Figure 7. Percentages of calls to 111 for cold or flu by season, Scotland Wales In Wales, the proportion of nurse-triaged possible flu-related calls represents calls coded as either related to colds and flu, cough, sore throat, fever and/or headache. This metric showed increases from week 40 and peaked in week 52 at 27%, stabilising around 20% from week 2 2024 to week 14 2024. Figure 8. Percentages of possible flu-related 111 calls by week, 2023 to 2024 season, Wales SARS-CoV-2 Immunity and Reinfection Evaluation (SIREN) cohort In SIREN 2.0 between September 2023 and March 2024, 5,970 healthcare workers from the original siren cohort completed fortnightly asymptomatic polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for SARS-CoV-2, influenza A/B and RSV, to monitor positivity rates and the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants. In addition, just under 5,000 participants provided samples for serology testing at regular time points. Participants are distributed across the UK, with a median age of 53 years, 78% are female, 59% in clinical roles and 85% of white ethnicity. Within the cohort, influenza positivity increased from week 48, peaked in week 52 2023 at 1.44 and again in week 5 2024 at 1.57% and decreased thereafter. RSV positivity increased from week 42, showing a temporary peak in activity in week 44 2023 at 1.39%, and after a few weeks of declining activity increases were observed which peaked at 2.27% positivity in week 51 2023 (Figure 9). Figure 9. Weekly positivity for Influenza A/B and RSV, SIREN cohort, 2023 to 2024 season, UK FluSurvey (internet-based surveillance) FluSurvey, run by the UK Health Security Agency, is an internet-based participatory surveillance system based on the InfluenzaNet platform (an EU initiative with 12 participating countries). It is designed to monitor trends of influenza-like illness (ILI) in the community using self-reported respiratory symptoms from registered UK participants. The platform has been adapted to capture respiratory symptoms, exposure risk and healthcare seeking behaviours among participants to contribute to national surveillance of COVID-19 and influenza activity since week 44 of 2020. Individuals aged 18 and over can register on the platform and complete a baseline profile questionnaire and weekly symptoms questionnaires on behalf of themselves or members of their household (referred to as ‘the participants’). The baseline profile questionnaire collects information on self-reported demographic, geographic, socioeconomic, and health data. Subsequently, participants are sent weekly reminders via email to report any symptoms relating to flu or COVID-19 that they may have experienced and their health-seeking behaviour as a result of their symptoms. Recruitment of survey participants commenced from October 2023 on a new web platform with a mixture of previous participants and new participants. Therefore, the baseline demographics and level of symptoms may have changed compared with last season, including the possibility that new registrations may have been initiated by recent onset of illness. The number of participants will slightly differ from the national weekly surveillance report as these analyses are based on participants that completed both the profile and symptoms questionnaires and are deduplicated by week. A total of 2,545 participants enrolled over the course of the season and completed at least one survey with an average weekly participation of 1,598 (62.8%), contributing each week. There were more participants in the 65 and over year age group (45.5%) compared to other age groups (2.2% aged 0 to 18 years, 13.0% aged 19 to 45 years, 38.7% aged 46 to 64 years). There was a higher proportion of female participants compared to male participants (62.3% compared to 36.7%). The majority (2,233 or 87.7%) of participants were resident in England, with 162 participants in Scotland, 22 participants in Northern Ireland and 80 in Wales. The European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) ILI case definition of sudden onset of symptoms with at least one of fever (chills), malaise, headache, muscle pain and at least one of cough, sore throat, shortness of breath has been used for reporting. The ILI case definition is derived based on self-reported symptoms only among all those who participated during each reporting week. The proportion of weekly participants with self-reported ILI episodes peaked in week 50 at 5.3% compared to previous season which peaked in week 52 at 4.5% (Figure 10). Healthcare use is presented as reported use of health services among persons who meet the ILI ECDC case definition. Where a person reports use of more than one health care service, secondary care will be indicated over primary care use and physical attendance to primary care will be indicated over use of remote services (for example, telephoning their GP or 111). Among participants who met the ILI ECDC case definition, the most frequently reported contact with healthcare services was a visit to their GP surgery. Figure 10. Weekly ILI incidence per 1,000 participants and their rate and type of healthcare use reported through FluSurvey, by season Crude self-reported daily social contact patterns by participants reporting any symptom are also shown (Figure 11), based on the number of people approached by the participants outside the household at less than one metre, on the day prior to survey completion. There was a slight increase in people reporting no social contacts around week 52 2023 consistent with the Christmas holiday period. Figure 11. FluSurvey symptomatic participants’ self-reported number of social contacts outside the household, 2023 to 2024 season FluDetector (internet-based surveillance) UKHSA works with University College London (UCL) to assess the use of internet-based search queries as a surveillance method for ILI in England. This is part of work on early-warning surveillance systems for influenza, through the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) Interdisciplinary Research Collaboration (IRC) project i-sense. Combining natural language processing and machine learning techniques, a non-linear Gaussian process model was developed by UCL to produce real-time estimates of ILI. The supervised model, trained on historic national data from the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) scheme, produces daily ILI estimates based on the proportion of ILI related search queries within a 10% to 15% sample of all queries issued, and is extracted daily from Google’s Health Trends Application Programming Interface. In the 2023 to 2024 season, estimated rates peaked around weeks 50 and 52 in 2023 (both at a rate of around 8.0 per 100,000) and week 4 2024 (estimated rate of 10.2 per 100,000). There was also a slight increase in activity later in the season in week 12 (peaking at 4.1 per 100,000). Overall rates were lower than previous seasons with influenza activity (Figure 12). Figure 12. Daily estimated ILI Google search query rates per 100,000 population by season Acute respiratory infection incidents ARI incidents in different settings that are reported to UKHSA health protection teams (HPTs) and entered onto the HPZone case and incident management system. Incidents are suspected or laboratory confirmed outbreaks and clusters of acute respiratory infections linked to a particular setting. All incidents are further investigated by the HPT in liaison with local partners. These data include only those reaching HPTs (rather than managed by health system partners such as community infection prevention and control teams) and classified as outbreaks rather than enquiries seeking public health advice. The ARI definition includes presentations of both of ILI and other acute viral respiratory infections (AVRI). Causal pathogens can include influenza A and B, RSV, adenovirus, rhinovirus, parainfluenza, human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and SARS-CoV-2. Detections may reflect the accessibility of testing for a particular pathogen as well as the incidence of disease. England In England, there were a total of 2,051 ARI incidents in closed settings reported between week 40 of 2023 and week 14 of 2024. Of these, 1,661 (81.0%) were reported from care homes, 104 (5.1%) from educational settings, 215 (10.5%) from hospital settings, 21 (1.0%) from prisons and 50 (2.4%) from other settings. Where information on virological testing results was available, 708 (53.3%) were confirmed as SARS-CoV-2, followed by 472 influenza incidents (35.5%), 68 RSV incidents (5.1%) and 80 (6.0%) incidents linked to other respiratory viruses or mixed infections (Table 1). Table 1. The number of incidents in England by institution and virus type between week 40 2023 and week 14 2024 Institution type SARS-CoV-2 Influenza RSV Other respiratory viruses and mixed infections Not available or not tested Care home 519 383 51 63 645 Educational setting 27 18 9 2 48 Hospital 124 61 5 7 18 Prison 8 8 0 4 1 Other settings 30 2 3 4 11 Total 708 472 68 80 723 The majority of influenza outbreaks occurred in care home settings, with the highest number in a week observed during week 4 2024 (Figure 13). 438 of the influenza incidents were influenza A(not subtyped), 10 were influenza B, 2 were influenza A(H3), and 1 was influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. In 21 incidents it was unknown whether this involved influenza A or B. Figure 13. The number of total influenza outbreaks by week and setting, the 2023 to 2024 season, England Scotland In Scotland, there were a total of 435 ARI outbreaks reported between week 40 2023 and week 14 2024, which was a decrease compared with 1,081 for the same time period in the 2022 to 2023 season. Of these, 344 (79.1%) were reported from care homes, 48 (11.0%) from educational settings, 36 (8.3%) from other settings, 5 (1.1%) from hospitals and 2 from prisons (0.5%). Virological results indicate that 84 outbreaks were SARS-CoV-2, 45 were influenza A(not subtyped), 1 was influenza A(H1N1), 1 was influenza B, 13 were RSV, 6 were hMPV, 3 were rhinovirus, and 1 was seasonal coronavirus. The remaining 281 outbreaks did not have an organism reported. Northern Ireland In Northern Ireland, there were a total of 502 confirmed respiratory outbreaks reported to the Public Health Agency Acute Response Duty Room between week 40 2023 and week 14 2024, compared to a total of 762 outbreaks for the same period in the 2022 to 2023 season and 1,058 outbreaks in the 2021 to 2022 season. A total of 234 (46.6%) of outbreaks were reported in a care home facility, 231 (46.0%) in a hospital setting and 37 (7.4%) were reported from other settings. Virological results were available for 502 confirmed respiratory outbreaks of which 420 were for SARS-CoV-2, 77 Influenza A (not subtyped), one influenza A(H1) and one influenza A(H3). Of the 77 influenza A (not subtyped) outbreaks reported, 8 facilities had another virus circulating at the same time. There were also 3 RSV outbreaks reported to the Public Health Agency (one of which had another virus circulating at the same time). Further information on ARI incidents during the 2023 to 2024 season is available in the weekly influenza and COVID-19 surveillance report and information on ARI incidents occurring in previous seasons is available in previous annual flu reports. Wales In Wales, outbreaks are reported on a different interface (Tarian) from other nations. Therefore some caution is needed when comparing absolute numbers between nations. There were a total of 205 ARI outbreaks reported between week 40 2023 and week 14 2024. Of these, 189 (92.2%) were reported from residential/care homes, 4 (11.0%) from educational settings, 5 (2.4%) from prisons and 7 (3.4%) from other settings. Virological results indicated that 173 outbreaks were due to SARS-CoV-2, 25 we due to influenza A(not subtyped), 1 was influenza A(H1N1), 1 was influenza B, 2 were due to RSV, 1 was due to parainfluenza and one was a mixed outbreak with influenza A(not subtyped) and RSV. In one outbreak no pathogen was identified. Primary care surveillance GP influenza-like-illness (ILI) consultations England Weekly rates of GP consultations for influenza-like illness (ILI) through the RCGP scheme remained below the 2023 to 2024 season moving epidemic method (MEM) baseline threshold of 10.25 per 100,000 for the duration of the influenza season (Figure 14). The ILI rate for the 2023 to 2024 season was similar or lower than that observed in the 2022 to 2023 season up to week 2 2024. In the 2022 to 2023 season, the ILI rates were above the MEM baseline threshold levels for 6 weeks. GP ILI consultation rates for the 2023 to 2024 season were similar or below the 2017 to 2018, 2018 to 2019 and 2019 to 2020 seasons for the duration of the influenza season (Figure 14). Figure 14. Weekly all age GP influenza-like illness rates by season, England (RCGP) [note 1] See [note 1] as above. Scotland Weekly GP consultations for ILI surpassed the baseline MEM threshold of 11.7 per 100,000 in weeks 1, 5, and 8 to 9 2024 in Scotland. Overall, the ILI consultation rate was lower than levels observed in the 2022 to 2023 season, however raised levels of activity were observed over a longer period than the previous season (Figure 15). Figure 15. Weekly all age GP influenza-like illness rates by season, Scotland [note 1] See [note 1] as above. Wales Weekly GP consultations for ILI in Wales surpassed the baseline MEM threshold of 11 per 100,000 in weeks 4 and 5 2024 The ILI consultation rate remained within the baseline MEM threshold for the rest of the season. Overall seasonal ILI consultation was higher than levels observed in 2021 to 2022 but below the activity in 2017 to 2018 (Figure 16). Figure 16. Weekly all age GP influenza-like illness rates by season, Wales [note 1] See [note 1] as above. Northern Ireland Weekly GP consultations for ILI in Northern Ireland surpassed the baseline MEM threshold of 10.7 per 100,000 between week 1 2024 and week 8 2024 and peaked at 19.2 per 100,000 in week 4 2024 (Figure 17). Rates in the current season were lower than observed in the 2022 to 2023 season, however remained above the baseline threshold for a longer duration (8 weeks) than the previous season (6 weeks). Figure 17. Weekly all age GP influenza-like illness rates by season, Northern Ireland [note 1] See [note 1] as above. Sentinel GP-based swabbing England In England, influenza positivity through the GP sentinel swabbing scheme in collaboration with the RCGP was lower overall in comparison with the previous season. Positivity began to increase in week 49 of 2023, compared to week 46 of 2022 last season (Figure 18). A total of 17,883 samples were tested between week 40 of 2023 and week 14 of 2024, 1,437 were positive for influenza. Between week 40 of 2022 and week 14 of 2023, a total of 9,062 samples were tested and 1,436 were positive for influenza. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 accounted for the majority of positive influenza specimens between week 40 2023 and week 14 2024. Among the positive samples for influenza, 53.5% (769 out of 1,437) were positive for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 34.6% (497 out of 1,437) were positive for influenza A(H3N2). Figure 18. Weekly positivity (%) for influenza in England by season, GP sentinel swabbing Broader virological swab positivity is depicted in Figure 19. For non-flu pathogens detected through the RCGP sentinel swabbing scheme, rhinovirus was the most detected respiratory pathogen between week 40 2023 and week 14 2024 in England (28.3% of total positive specimens). Influenza comprised 17.8% of the total respiratory pathogens detected in the swabbing scheme. This was followed by RSV at 15.9% of total positive specimens, hMPV at 11.4%, SARS-CoV-2 at 10.1%, seasonal coronavirus at 9.1%, adenovirus at 3.5% and enterovirus at 3.9%. Please note that starting in week 51, enterovirus and rhinovirus testing have been delayed. Figure 19.

Scotland In Scotland, the Community Acute Respiratory Infection (CARI) surveillance programme is the GP sentinel surveillance system and tests for a range of respiratory pathogens: SARS-CoV-2, influenza A and B, RSV, adenovirus, coronavirus (non-SARS-CoV-2), hMPV, rhinovirus, parainfluenza and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Between week 40 of 2023 and week 14 of 2024, 13.0% (2,786 out of 21,467) of total detections were influenza: 4.9% (1,048 out of 21,467) were influenza A(H3N2), 4.2% (908 out of 21,467) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, 2.0% (439 out of 21,467) were influenza A(not subtyped), 1.7% (358 out of 21,467) were influenza B. Additionally there were 10 were co-infections (<0.1% of total detections) of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza A(H3N2) and 23 were co-infections of influenza A and influenza B (0.1% of total detections). For non-flu pathogens, rhinovirus was the most commonly detected respiratory pathogen through sentinel sources (CARI) for the 2023 to 2024 season (up to week 14, 2024), with 17.7% of 20,535 samples testing positive for rhinovirus. Mycoplasma pneumoniae was the second most common non-influenza pathogen (8.7% of 20,575 samples) followed by seasonal coronavirus (non-SARS-CoV-2) (5.4% of 20,468 samples), RSV (6.2% of 20,469 samples), hMPV (6.0% of 20,469 samples), SARS-CoV-2 (5.2% of 21,727 samples), parainfluenza (4.0% of 20,440 samples) and adenovirus (2.2% of 20,447 samples). Figure 22 below includes individual pathogens and total samples received, in addition to coinfections as some samples tested positive for more than one pathogen (8.2% of all samples). Figure 22. Number of CARI samples and positives by pathogen, Scotland, week 40 2023 to week 14 2024 Wales In Wales, 5,259 samples were received for testing from sentinel GP practices between week 40 2023 and week 14 2024. Of these, 504 specimens tested positive for influenza during the 2023 to 2024 season through GP sentinel swabbing: 139 were influenza A(H3N2), 200 were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, 74 were influenza A(not subtyped) and 91 were influenza B. Of non-flu respiratory pathogens, 650 samples tested positive for Rhinovirus, 346 for Mycoplasma Pneumoniae, 274 for RSV, 274 for SARS-CoV-2, 254 for hMPV, 220 for other coronaviruses, 174 for parainfluenza, 144 were positive for enterovirus, 101 for Adenovirus and 29 were positive for Bocavirus. Figure 23. Number of GP sentinel samples and positives by pathogen, Wales, week 40 2023 to week 14 2024 Northern Ireland In Northern Ireland, 668 swabs were received from week 40 2023 to week 14 2024. 188 specimens tested positive for influenza during the 2023 to 2024 season through GP sentinel swabbing, of which 135 tested positive for influenza A(H3), 42 for influenza A(H1), 3 were influenza A(not subtyped) and 8 were influenza B. The highest amount of positive samples were received in week 4 2024 and a majority of positive samples (140) were received between weeks 2 2024 and week 8 2024. 16 swabs tested positive for RSV, with most detections (11 positive samples) occurring between weeks 44 and 47 2023. Secondary care surveillance Influenza hospitalisations England In England, the Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) Watch surveillance system was established in 2020 to report the number of laboratory-confirmed influenza, COVID-19 and RSV cases admitted to hospital and critical care units (ICU or HDU) in acute NHS trusts. This replaced surveillance systems used in previous seasons for reporting influenza and COVID-19 cases admitted to hospital – the UK Severe Influenza Surveillance System (USISS) and the COVID-19 Hospitalisations in England Surveillance System (CHESS). Aggregate level data is submitted weekly by acute NHS trusts in England. A week is based on the ISO week system running from Monday to Sunday. There are 137 acute NHS trusts in England at this time. The weekly rate of new admissions of influenza cases is based on the catchment population of those NHS trusts who made a return in that week. Surveillance is usually between week 40 (around October) to week 20 (late May) in the following year. However, during the pandemic (affecting seasons 2020 to 2021 and 2021 to 2022), influenza and RSV surveillance were extended to week 39 (comprising one-year surveillance) to detect out of season rebounds. Influenza ICU or HDU surveillance was also extended to week 39 2023 in the 2022 to 2023 season. Trends in influenza hospitalisation and critical care admission should be interpreted in the context of testing practices for acute respiratory infections. In recent years there has been wider implementation of rapid molecular point of care tests for influenza in hospital settings. From a public health surveillance perspective, it is important to consider a step change in influenza case ascertainment in more recent years. Subtyping of influenza A admissions to critical care is strongly recommended in line with existing guidance for hospital settings. This is in the context of vigilance over avian influenza and concern that severe cases presenting in ICU or HDU settings may be missed. In November 2023, a human case of A(H1N2)v was detected in the Yorkshire region which prompted a reminder to support subtyping of influenza A cases in the region. The testing direction may impact on the ratio of subtyped to unsubtyped cases in surveillance data. Furthermore, the ratios of different flu types and subtypes should be interpreted with caution due to possible differences in the availability of assays for different subtypes. The cumulative rates presented are based on a sum of weekly rates which take into account only trusts participating in that week. Figures 24, 27, 32 and 35 were adjusted to account for the leap week in 2020. Through SARI Watch, a total of 8,026 hospitalised confirmed influenza cases were reported by 31 participating sentinel NHS acute trusts in England from week 40 2023 to week 14 2024 inclusive. Of 31 trusts, 26 were regular reporters participating in 18 weeks or more in this period. This compares with 9,713 cases in the previous season (from week 40 2022 to week 14 in 2023) reported by 44 trusts. As a sentinel surveillance system, the number of trusts volunteering to participate may vary between seasons. Therefore, rates of hospitalised influenza cases are presented here to compare between different seasons. The cumulative admission rate between week 40 and week 14 was 76.9 per 100,000 trust catchment population in the 2023 to 2024 season. This compares with cumulative admission rates of between week 40 to week 14 of 94.2 per 100,000 in the 2022 to 2023 season. In the 2023 to 2024 season, the baseline MEM threshold was breached in week 49 2023 with a rate of 2.20 per 100,000 (Figure 24). Two peaks followed, one in week 52 (week commencing December 25) 2023 with a rate of 6.65 per 100,000 and another in week 4 (week commencing 22 January) 2024 with a rate of 7.55 per 100,000, both crossing into the medium impact range. The epidemic wave in the 2023 to 2024 season was similar to those in pre-pandemic seasons in terms of timing of the peak and magnitude of rates. In comparison, in the 2022 to 2023 season the rate breached the baseline threshold in week 45 2022 with a rate of 1.67 per 100,000. The peak was in week 51 with a rate of 18.09 per 100,000, crossing into the very high impact range. The epidemic wave in the 2022 to 2023 season was characterised by earlier activity, a sharp increase, a high peak and steep decreases (please refer to the previous annual report for further details). Weekly confirmed influenza hospitalisation rates to sentinel hospital trusts in England since winter 2016 are shown in Figure 27. Figure 24. Weekly influenza hospital admission rates per 100,000 trust catchment population (with MEM thresholds), reported through SARI Watch sentinel surveillance, England [note 1] See [note 1] as above. Figure 25 shows the proportional distribution of 8,026 sentinel influenza hospital admissions reported up to week 14 2024 by subtypeype and age group. Overall, 1,156 were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, 543 were influenza A(H3N2), 5,770 were influenza A(not subtyped) and 557 were influenza B. Influenza B can become a more common cause of admission later in the season than influenza A. In the 2023 to 2024 season, small increases in influenza B hospitalisations were observed from January 2024 peaking at 0.48 per 100,000 (based on 50 cases) in week 9 2024 but did not overtake influenza A hospitalisations. In the previous season influenza B also emerged later in the season but in higher case numbers, peaking at 1.23 per 100,000 (based on 116 cases) in week 7 2023 and overtaking influenza A. In both seasons the late season rise in influenza B mainly affected those aged 15 to 44 years. The subtyping of influenza A data is used for public health surveillance and allows a more complete picture of circulating subtypes affecting severe cases. Hospital trusts are encouraged to perform influenza subtyping locally where possible or regionally and to integrate results into local information systems. This sentinel system has noted a high proportion of influenza A that has not been subtyped in recent years. This may reflect increase in the use of rapid nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) used at the point of care as well as longer standing use of laboratory NAATs that do not include subtyping. Overall, of total influenza A hospitalised cases in the 2023 to 2024 season, 77% (5,770 out of 7,469) were not subtyped, ranging from 62% (69 out of 111) in 6 to 11 months to 82% (649 out of 794) in those aged 1 to 4 years. The data shows that those under one year had a lower proportion of influenza A samples subtyped at 68% for under 6 months and 6 to 11 months groups combined (165 out of 242). For other age groups, this percentage ranged from 76% to 79% apart from 1 to 4 years. As comparison, in the previous season, from week 40 2022 to week 14 2023, the overall proportion of influenza A hospitalised cases that were not subtyped was higher at 85% (7,164 out of 8,422). The ratio of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 to influenza A(H3N2) is a useful indicator of which of circulating influenza A subtype is dominant. This ratio was 1.1 in the early part from week 40 to 47 2023 in favour of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and increased to 2.2 in the latter part of the season. The increase may reflect the choice of assay that prioritised detection of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 over influenza A(H3N2). This coincided with the direction to NHS trusts in late November 2023 to subtype influenza A samples following the detection of a human case of influenza A(H1N2)v. As a result of testing changes from November 2023, it may be difficult to definitively conclude what was the true main circulating subtype among hospitalised influenza cases in the 2023 to 2024 season. Figure 25 shows the proportion of influenza subtypes by age group amongst hospitalised influenza cases in the 2023 to 2024 season. There was a slightly higher proportion of influenza B cases in younger age groups. The highest numbers were among those aged 15 to 44 years (n=1,801), followed by those aged 75 to 84 years (n=1,172) and 85 years (n=908). Absolute counts per age group will be published in the accompanying datafile. However, the rates which measure impact in the context of a susceptible population, were highest in the elderly particularly those aged 85 years and over (Figure 26). The rate in this age group peaked at 46.11 per 100,000 in week 4 (commencing 22 January) 2024. The rate in 75 to 84 years was the next highest, peaking also in week 4 2024 at 21.21 per 100,000. The rate in under 5 years was the next highest peaking at 17.74 per 100,000 also in week 4 2024. The rate in 15 to 44 years was one of the lowest peaking at 3.91 per 100,000 in week 5 2024.

Weekly influenza hospital admission rate by age group, reported through SARI-Watch sentinel surveillance, week 40 2023 to week 14 2024 [note 2] See [note 2] as above. Figure 27. Weekly all-age rate of confirmed influenza hospital admissions to sentinel trusts, 2016 to 2024, England Scotland Scottish influenza hospital admissions are calculated by linking the Rapid Preliminary Inpatient Dataset (RAPID) emergency or non-injury hospital admissions to positive Electronic Communication of Surveillance in Scotland (ECOSS) test results. RAPID captures all hospital admissions. The ECOSS data set provides all laboratory test data for respiratory viruses (including SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and RSV) in Scotland. Linkage is performed by linking the Community Health Index (CHI) number with the admission date to the ECOSS test results and test date. Cases counted in the hospital admission totals for these pathogens are defined as those admitted to hospital, appearing in RAPID and testing positive for influenza (appearing in ECOSS with a test or specimen date) within 14 days prior or 48 hours post RAPID admission date. There were a total 4,911 influenza hospital admissions reported in Scotland between week 40 2023 and week 14 2024, yielding a cumulative rate of 89.6 per 100,000 compared to 121.7 per 100,000 in the 2022 to 2023 season. Influenza hospital admissions peaked in week 52 2023 and again week 4 2024. There was a relatively equal ratio of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (n=448) admissions and influenza A(H3N2) admissions (n=444) during this period, with a late-season surge of influenza B admissions from week 8 2024 onwards. Further evolution of these trends can be found in the PHS weekly report. Figure 28. Weekly influenza hospitalisation rates, by season, Scotland Figure 29. Weekly number of influenza admissions by influenza subtype, week 40 2023 to week 14 2024, Scotland Northern Ireland Influenza admissions data comes from all trusts providing healthcare (100% coverage). Any admission with a positive influenza test taken with a period between 7 days prior to admissions, anytime during the admission and up to 7 days after discharge is included. Admission activity increased in week 48, showed a single peak in week 4 2024 at 15.9 per 100,000 and steadily declined for the remainder of the season. As there is 100% coverage counts by influenza subtype are shown in Figure 30. There was a total of 2,708 admissions, with a cumulative admission rate of 141.7 per 100,000. Overall, 314 admissions were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, 1,050 were influenza A(H3N2), 1,282 were influenza A(not subtyped) and 62 were influenza B. Influenza A(H3N2) was dominant in all age groups (Figure 31). Figure 30. Weekly number of influenza admissions by influenza subtype, week 40 2023 to week 14 2024, Northern Ireland Figure 31. Proportion of influenza hospital admissions by influenza subtype and age group, Northern Ireland, week 40 2023 to week 14 2024 Wales Hospitalized ARI cases in Wales are calculated by linking hospital admissions from Patient Administration Systems (PAS) to Datastore test results using the patient NHS number. Cases are defined as those admitted to hospital who tested positive for an ARI within 28 days prior to admission or up to day 2 of an inpatient stay (where admission date is day 1). A total of 1,159 hospitalized influenza cases were reported in Wales from week ending 40 2023 to week 13 2024. Activity increased in week 46 2023 and peaked in week 52 2023 at 2.2 per 100,000 and again in week 4 2024 at 3.4 per 100,000 (Figure 32). Figure 32. Weekly influenza hospitalisation rate per 100,000, Wales, the 2023 to 2024 season Influenza ICU or HDU admissions England Through SARI Watch, a total of 873 critical care (ICU or HDU) confirmed influenza admissions were reported by 112 NHS acute trusts across England from week 40 2023 to week 14 2024. This compares with 1,660 critical care influenza admissions reported by 110 trusts from week 40 2022 to week 14 in 2023. The cumulative rate was 1.92 per 100,000 trust catchment population based on data from week 40 2023 to week 14 2024. In the 2022 to 2023 season the cumulative rate for the same reporting interval was 3.78 per 100,000. The ICU or HDU admission rate for influenza crossed the baseline threshold in week 51 2023 with rate of 0.12 per 100,000 trust catchment population (Figure 32). An initial small peak followed in week 52 at 0.12 per 100,000. Two subsequent relatively larger peaks occurred in week 4 and 6 2024, both at 0.20 per 100,000 and remaining in the low impact range. As comparison, in the 2022 to 2023 season, the ICU or HDU admission rate for confirmed influenza increased earlier compared with pre-pandemic seasons crossing the baseline threshold in week 46 2022 with rate of 0.12 per 100,000. The peak was in week 51 2022 at 0.64 per 100,000, crossing into the high impact range for the first time since the 2019 to 2020 season. In the context of all the recent seasons (except 2020 to 2021 and 2021 to 2022), the peak in the rate of ICU or HDU admission for influenza in the 2023 to 2024 season was lower compared to other seasons with influenza activity (Figure 32). Of 873 influenza ICU or HDU admissions reported up to week 14 2024, 116 were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, 37 were influenza A(H3N2), 676 were influenza A (not subtyped) and 44 were influenza B (Figure 33). There was no observed increase in influenza B admissions later in the season. A high proportion of influenza A detections remains unsubtyped. Of all influenza A ICU or HDU cases in the 2023 to 2024 season, 82% (676 out of 829) were not subtyped, ranging from 73% (52 out of 71) in 5 to 14 years to 91% (20 out of 22) infants aged 6 months or less (Figure 34). The overall proportion of unsubtyped influenza A cases in critical care was similar in the 2022 to 2023 season at 85% (1,196 out of 1,459). Figure 33 shows the distribution of influenza ICU or HDU case numbers by age group and influenza type and subtype in the 2023 to 2024 season. The highest numbers were among those aged 15 to 44 years (n=175). However, the rate of admission was highest in older adults and those under 5 years (Figure 34) although rates across the board were low (less than 0.6 per 100,000) due to the low number of cases. The highest rate was for under 5 years at 0.54 per 100,000 in week 6 but the rates were mainly highest in 45 to 54 and 55 to 64 years. The rates for those aged 85 years and over was one of the lowest reflecting critical care admission protocols. The surveillance of influenza ICU or HDU admissions includes a separate collection for fatalities (any cause) among influenza cases admitted in ICU or HDU as an indication of severity near real time for use in conjunction with other severity indicators such as excess mortality – this is not equivalent to cause of death as included in death registrations. There were 75 fatalities reported among influenza cases admitted to ICU or HDU from week 40 2023 to week 14 2024. Of these, 12 were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, 2 were influenza A(H3N2), 58 were influenza A(not subtyped) and 3 were influenza B. Patients aged 65 years or over made up the largest group in ICU and HDU influenza fatal case reporting (40% of fatal cases). In the season the 2022 to 2023 season there were 139 fatalities among influenza cases admitted to ICU or HDU. Weekly confirmed influenza ICU or HDU admission rates in England since winter 2016 are shown in Figure 35. Figure 33. Weekly influenza ICU or HDU admission rates per 100,000 trust catchment population (with MEM thresholds), reported through SARI Watch mandatory surveillance, England [note 1] See [note 1] as above.

Weekly all-age rate of confirmed influenza ICU or HDU admissions, 2016 to 2024, England Scotland Patients admitted to ICU or HDU with recently confirmed influenza are identified from the Scottish Intensive Care Society Audit Group (SICSAG) that collects detailed patient level data on all patients in ICU or HDU across Scotland. Additional information on patients with laboratory confirmed influenza is collected through ICU enhanced surveillance forms. All patients that are admitted to ICU or HDU with a positive influenza test result within a period of 14 days before the ICU or HDU admission and the ICU or HDU discharge date are included. Where the discharge date is missing, any patient with a positive influenza test result within a period of 14 days before ICU or HDU admission and 7 days after ICU or HDU admission are included. There was a total of 240 ICU admissions in adults in the period between week 40 2023 and week 14 2024. Of these, 38 were positive for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, 26 were positive for influenza A(H3N2), 170 were positive for influenza A(unknown subtype) and 6 were positive for influenza B. Admissions peaked in week 52 with 25 admissions (Figure 36). The age distribution and subtypes are shown in Figure 37. Figure 37. Weekly ICU or HDU admissions by influenza subtype, Scotland, the 2023 to 2024 season Figure 38. Proportion of influenza ICU or HDU admissions by influenza type and subtype, and age group, reported through SICSAG, Scotland, week 40 2023 to week 14 2024 Wales 75 influenza ICU admissions were reported in Wales. Among 25 admissions were subtyping information was available, 14 were positive for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, 6 were positive for influenza A(H3N2), and 5 were positive for Influenza B. Northern Ireland Critical care data from Northern Ireland was not available. ECMO admissions UKHSA collects data on every adult patient admitted to a severe respiratory failure (SRF) centre, for extra corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or other advanced respiratory support, whether or not the primary cause is known to be infection related. There are 7 SRF centres in the UK (6 in England and 1 in Scotland) participating in the UKHSA ECMO surveillance module. Surveillance is all year round. For the surveillance, SRFs can select from a range of principal causes of admission, including test confirmed acute respiratory infection (ARI) and non-infection cause (such as asthma, primary cardiac and trauma. Causative pathogen is reported for test confirmed ARI admissions. Between week 40 2023 and week 14 2024, there were 94 admissions to SRF centres requiring ECMO in the UK (Figure 38). Of these, confirmed ARI accounted for 38% (36 out of 94) and non-infection accounted for 46% (43 out of 94). Suspected ARI and sepsis of non-respiratory origin accounted for 9% and 7% of admissions requiring ECMO respectively but underlying numbers were small. Of 36 ARI ECMO admissions in the 2023 to 2024 season, 16 were for influenza (9 influenza A (not subtyped), 4 influenza A(H3N2), 3 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 0 influenza B cases). In this period, there were 2 COVID-19 admissions, but no RSV admissions. In the previous season (from week 40 2022 to week 14 2023), there were 113 admissions to SRF centres requiring ECMO in the UK. Of these, confirmed ARI accounted for 58% (65 out of 113) and non-infection accounted for 32% (36 out of 113). Of 65 confirmed ARI cases, 39 were influenza (19 influenza A (not subtyped), 8 influenza A(H3N2), 5 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 7 influenza B cases). There were 3 RSV admissions. In pre-pandemic seasons, there were 37 influenza admissions to adult SRF centres in 2019 to 2020, 110 in 2018 to 2019 and 62 in 2017 to 2018. Figure 39. Laboratory confirmed ECMO admissions in adults (influenza and non-influenza confirmed) to Severe Respiratory Failure centres in the UK, week 14 2022 to week 14 2024 RSV England UKHSA collates data on confirmed hospitalised RSV cases in England through the SARI Watch surveillance system. For RSV, this is a sentinel surveillance system. Between week 40 2023 and week 14 2024, a total of 3,016 confirmed RSV cases (2,758 hospitalised to lower level of care and 258 admitted to ICU or HDU) were reported from 24 participating sentinel trusts. Of 24 trusts, 18 were regular reporters (participating in 18 weeks or more in the 27-week reporting period). The cumulative admission rate between week 40 2023 and week 14 2024 was 37.79 per 100,000 trust catchment population. This compares to 32.98 per 100,000 in the 2022 to 2023 season for the same 27-week interval from the 2022 to 2023 season. The epidemic wave for RSV in the 2023 to 2024 season and the 2022 to 2023 season (both up to week 14) was similar to those in pre-pandemic seasons in terms of timing of the peak and seasonality. However, RSV activity in the 2022 to 2023 season appeared to be lower even after a return to seasonality which may be partly explained by disease activity in earlier weeks (from week 21 to 39 2022) as RSV transitioned towards normal seasonality following easing of pandemic control measures. It should be noted that the displacement effect was strongest in summer of 2021 (please refer to the previous annual report for details). The overall RSV hospitalisation rate (inclusive of ICU or HDU admissions) in the 2023 to 2024 season peaked at 3.95 per 100,000 trust catchment population in week 48 2023. In the 2022 to 2023 season this peaked at 3.17 per 100,000 in week 47 2022. For comparison, peak weekly admission rates for RSV (lower level of care and ICU or HDU) were observed at 5.28 per 100,000 in 2019 to 2020, 4.67 per 100,000 in 2018 to 2019 and 4.06 per 100,000 in 2017 to 2018 (Figure 39). Figure 40. Weekly hospitalised RSV case rate per 100,000 trust catchment population, England, post pandemic (the 2023 to 2024 season and the 2022 to 2023 season) and pre- pandemic seasons (2019 to 2020, 2018 to 2018 and 2017 to 2018) Children under the age of 5 years are most affected by RSV with substantially high hospitalisation rates. Those aged 65 years and over have the next highest burden. In the 2023 to 2024 season the RSV hospitalisation rate for children aged under 5 years peaked at 44.83 per 100,000 in week 48 2023 (Figure 40). The epidemic curve in the 2023 to 2024 season and the 2022 to 2023 season for those under 5 years both followed a typical seasonal pattern. This is in contrast to the 2 preceding seasons over the pandemic (2020 to 2021 and 2021 to 2022) where displacement of RSV activity to the summer following the easing of COVID-19 restrictions (thus allowing some other respiratory viruses to circulate). The previous annual report provides a more detailed description. As comparison to pre-pandemic years, the RSV hospitalisation rate in those under 5 year olds peaked at 56.73 per 100,000 in week 51 in 2019 to 2020, 67.37 per 100,000 in week 48 in 2018 to 2019, and at 56.38 per 100,000 in week 46 in 2017 to 2018. In the 2023 to 2024 season from week 40 to week 14 inclusive, there were 1,739 RSV hospitalisations (lower level of care or ICU or HDU admissions) to SARI-Watch sentinel trusts in those aged under 5 years. Of these, 647% (1,123) were in children aged under 1 year, including 849 aged 6 months or younger. Figure 41. Rate of RSV hospitalisation in those aged under 5 years per 100,000 trust catchment population by week of admission and season, sentinel data from acute NHS trusts, England, post pandemic (the 2023 to 2024 season and the 2022 to 2023 season) and pre- pandemic seasons (2019 to 2020, 2018 to 2018 and 2017 to 2018) The rate for those aged 65 years and over peaked at 6.43 per 100,000 in week 52 2023, later than the peak among children aged under 5 years (Figure 41). For those aged 85 years and over the rate peaked at 17.26 per 100,000 in week 52 2023. In pre-pandemic seasons the rate for the elderly (65 years and over) was 6.93 per 100,000 in 2019 to 2020, 6.07 per 100,000 in 2018 to 2019 and 3.77 per 100,000 in 2017 to 2018. These also peaked later than the peaks for children aged under 5 years. Rates across all age groups are shown in Figure 42. Figure 42. Weekly hospitalisation (including ICU or HDU) admission rates by age group for RSV cases reported through SARI Watch sentinel surveillance, England Scotland Scottish RSV hospital admissions are calculated by linking the Rapid Preliminary Inpatient Dataset (RAPID) emergency or non-injury hospital admissions to positive ECOSS test results. RAPID captures all hospital admissions. The ECOSS data set provides all laboratory test data for respiratory viruses (including SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and RSV) in Scotland. Linkage is performed by linking the Community Health Index (CHI) number with the admission date to the ECOSS test results and test date. Cases counted in the hospital admission totals for these pathogens are defined as those admitted to hospital, appearing in RAPID and testing positive (appearing in ECOSS with a test/specimen date) within 14 days prior or 48 hours post RAPID admission date. There was a total of 4,057 RSV admissions reported in Scotland from week 40 2023 to week 14 2024, yielding a cumulative hospital admission rate of 74.0 per 100,000. Activity peaked in week 46 2023 at 394 admissions (7.2 per 100,000) and declined thereafter (Figure 42). Figure 43. Rate of overall RSV hospitalisation per 100,000 population by week of admission, Scotland, by season Northern Ireland There was a total of 1,284 RSV admissions reported in Northern Ireland from week 40 2023 to week 14 2024, yielding a cumulative hospital admission rate of 67.2 per 100,000. Activity peaked in week 47 2023 at 147 admissions (7.7 per 100,000) and declined thereafter (Figure 44). Figure 44. Rate of overall RSV hospitalisation per 100,000 population by week of admission, Northern Ireland, the 2023 to 2024 season Wales Hospitalized ARI cases in Wales are calculated by linking hospital admissions from Patient Administration Systems (PAS) to Datastore test results using the patient NHS number. Cases are defined as those admitted to hospital who tested positive for an ARI within 28 days prior to admission or up to day 2 of an inpatient stay (where admission date is day 1). A total of 1,386 hospitalized RSV cases were reported in Wales from week 40 2023 to week 13 2024. Activity was increasing in week 40 and peaked in week 44 at 3.4 per 100,000 and steadily declined thereafter (Figure 45). Figure 45. Weekly RSV hospitalisation rate per 100,000, Wales, the 2023 to 2024 season Microbiological surveillance Influenza England The Respiratory Datamart system began during the 2009 influenza pandemic to collate all laboratory testing information in England. It is now used as a sentinel laboratory surveillance tool, monitoring all major respiratory viruses in England. 16 laboratories in England, including 4 public health laboratories, 11 NHS hospital laboratories and a UKHSA national laboratory, reported data for this season. The majority of samples were received from hospitals. Overall influenza positivity showed an increased level of activity (above 5%) between week 49 of 2023 and week 11 of 2024, with peak positivity (17.5%) much lower than that seen in the 2022 to 2023 season (31.0%) (Figure 46). There was bimodal activity with a first lower peak in week 52 2023 and the main peak seen in week 4 2024. Reduced mixing during the holiday period may explain this pattern. The majority of detections were influenza A (Figure 47). Of the detected influenza A viruses that were subtyped, the majority were influenza A(H3N2). Influenza B positivity increased to levels between 1.6% and 1.7% between week 5 2024 and week 11 2024. Comparatively, the 2023 to 2024 season was a longer, lower, later season than the 2022 to 2023 season detections of all influenza through Respiratory DataMart. Peak positivity was also lower than the 25.3% in 2019 to 2020 and 28.6% in 2018 to 2019 season. However, positivity estimates should be interpreted with caution as they arise from time periods when SARS-CoV-2 was not co-circulating. Figure 46. Weekly influenza swab percentage positivity through Respiratory Datamart sentinel laboratories by season, England See [note 1] as above. Figure 47. Number of influenza detections by subtype through Respiratory Datamart sentinel laboratories in England The weekly count of confirmed cases by each major type or subtype of influenza through Respiratory DataMart from winter 2009 onwards is shown in Figure 48. Figure 48. Weekly number of influenza detections by subtype and overall percentage positivity, Respiratory Datamart, England, 2010 to 2024 Scotland In Scotland, overall influenza positivity is reported through non-sentinel sources via ECOSS. There have been fewer numbers of influenza diagnoses recorded to date this season with a total of 9,791 samples testing positive for influenza between week 40 of 2023 and week 14 of 2024 when compared to the previous season. Overall influenza positivity peaked between week 52 2023 and week 4 2024 at 14.9% and 14.7% respectively (figures 49 and 50). Figure 49.

Positivity increased starting in week 49 2023 and peaked once in week 3 2024 at approximately 22% and then gradually declined (Figure 48). Figure 51. Weekly influenza positivity by season, Northern Ireland A total of 2,322 of these samples were influenza A(not subtyped), 1,675 were influenza A(H3), 490 were influenza A(H1) and 114 were influenza B. Distribution of these samples across the season are shown in Figure 52. Figure 52. Weekly positive influenza samples by subtype, Northern Ireland Wales Diagnostic virology test results comprise test result for diagnostic respiratory panel testing in patients with ARI symptoms. The vast majority of these patients are in hospital, with a small proportion from non-sentinel community sources. Out of 33,162 samples, 2,304 tested positive for influenza A, and 251 tested positive for influenza B. Overall influenza positivity started to increase in week 46 2023 and peaked in week 52 2023 at 11.8% and again in week 5 2024 at 17.0% (Figure 53). Figure 53. Weekly influenza positivity, diagnostic virology, Wales Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) England From week 40 2023 to week 14 2024, RSV detections reported through the Respiratory DataMart surveillance system in England showed a similar seasonality as in pre-COVID pandemic seasons. All-age positivity peaked at 12.5% in week 48 2023. This compares with positivity peak of 13.4% in 2019 to 2020 (Figure 54). However, positivity estimates should be interpreted with caution as they arise from time periods when SARS-CoV-2 was not co-circulating. Positivity by age group for the 2023 to 2024 season is shown in Figure 55 with highest positivity in those aged under 5 years old. Surveillance of RSV is ongoing with further data of current trends published in the weekly national influenza and COVID-19 surveillance report. Figure 54. Weekly overall RSV swab percentage positivity through Respiratory DataMart by season, England [note 1] See [note 1] as above. Figure 55. Respiratory DataMart weekly positivity (%) for RSV by age, England Scotland In Scotland, RSV was the most commonly detected non-influenza respiratory pathogen detected through ECOSS for the 2023 to 2024 season (up to week 14 2024), accounting for 22.2% of all positive samples. Northern Ireland Across the whole season 1,605 (5.4% of 29,611 samples) samples tested positive for RSV. RSV positivity peaked in week 46 2023 at 18.3%, and then gradually declined. Wales Across the whole season 2,271 (6.8% of 33,162 samples) samples tested positive for RSV. RSV positivity peaked in week 44 2023 at 27%, and then gradually declined. Other seasonal respiratory viruses England Of the other respiratory viruses monitored through the respiratory DataMart system, the highest levels of positivity were observed with rhinovirus throughout the season. Rhinovirus positivity was highest at the beginning of the season and then decreased and fluctuated between 6% and 24% positivity through the rest of the season, with lower activity levels seen between week 2 2024 and week 10 2024 (Figure 56a). Consistent with typical previous seasons, low levels of adenovirus were observed throughout the season (Figure 56b). Parainfluenza positivity started to increase slowly from week 47 2023, and by the data cut-off time for this report (week 14 2024) it increased to 7.2% in week 14 which was slightly higher than the 2022 to 2023 season peak of 6.3% in week 13 2023 (Figure 56c). Parainfluenza subtype analysis showed that parainfluenza 3 was the main circulating subtype accounting for 74.4% of all 4 subtypes in this season with data up to week 14 2024, which was similar to the previous seasons between 2020 and 2023 but different from the 2019 to 2020 season when parainfluenza 1 accounted for 36.0% followed by parainfluenza 3 (25.7%), parainfluenza 2 (22.1%) and parainfluenza 4 (16.2%). Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) activity in the 2023 to 2024 season was generally consistent with recent seasons outside of those impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and peaked at 4.3% in week 52 2023, compared with the peak of 5.2% in week 52 2022 in the 2022 to 2023 season (Figure 56d).

Weekly sample positivity for human metapneumovirus (hMPV) by season, DataMart sentinel laboratories, England Scotland Rhinovirus was the second-most commonly detected non-influenza respiratory pathogen detected through non-sentinel sources (ECOSS) for the 2023 to 2024 season (up to week 14, 2024), contributing to 15.9% of positive samples. Followed by Mycoplasma pneumoniae (5.3% of positive samples), hMPV (4.8% of positive samples), adenovirus (4.4% of positive samples), parainfluenza (3.6% of positive samples) and seasonal coronavirus (3.5% of positive samples). Wales In Wales, of the 33,162 testing episodes in hospital patients that had a sample collected from a hospital setting, the most commonly detected non-influenza respiratory pathogens were SARS-CoV-2 (7.8%, 2,574 out of 33,162) and rhinovirus (13.1%, 4,351 out of 33,162). Other detected causes of respiratory infection included: adenovirus (4.2%, 1,412 out of 33,162), enterovirus (2.7%, 882 out of 33,162), seasonal coronavirus (2.3%, 773 out of 33,162), hMPV (4.2%, 1,403 out of 33,162), parainfluenza (2.2%, 729 out of 33,162) and Mycoplasma pneumoniae (2.9%, 953 out of 33,162). Northern Ireland Only data regarding influenza and RSV was available. Preceding, co- and secondary respiratory infections with influenza The surveillance of preceding, co-, and secondary infections with COVID-19 in England began as part of UKHSA’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic and was expanded to include the surveillance of pathogens acquired in conjunction with influenza in 2022. Regular reporting in the National flu and COVID-19 surveillance report began in late 2020. The workstream aims to provide rapid detection and timely surveillance of bacterial, viral, and fungal pathogens acquired in conjunction with COVID-19 and influenza. Seasonal respiratory virus co-infections are defined as a patient with laboratory-confirmed influenza and a sample testing positive for another respiratory viral organism within one day (before or after) of the influenza positive specimen date. Other respiratory viral organisms of interest are adenovirus, SARS-CoV-2, enterovirus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus, and seasonal coronavirus. Full preceding, co-, and secondary infection definitions are available in Appendix 1 of the National flu and COVID-19 surveillance graphs packs. Preceding and secondary infection definitions for respiratory viral infections are defined as the positive specimen date occurring 2 to 27 days pre- or post-laboratory-confirmed influenza positive specimen date. Please note that undertesting of pathogens may result in an underestimate of preceding, co-, and secondary infection cases. Furthermore, children receiving the live attenuated Influenza vaccine (LAIV) in the 14 days prior to swabbing may result in positive influenza detection in the absence of infection. Seasonal respiratory viral pathogens acquired in conjunction with influenza Please note, the base infection is any type of influenza (A, B, or both) for all viral preceding, co-, and secondary infections, except for influenza B where the base infection is influenza A. A total of 4,216 pre-, co-, and secondary infections were detected across all seasonal respiratory viruses amongst persons with influenza in the 2023 to 2024 season in England, via the Respiratory DataMart and SGSS systems. Of which, 2,943 were defined as co-infections, 733 as preceding, and 540 as secondary to an influenza infection (Figure 57). Between week 40 2023 and week 14 2024, 215 respiratory viral co-infections of influenza B and influenza A were identified in England. A total of 8 preceding and 13 secondary influenza B infections with influenza A were reported (Figure 58). Between week 40 2023 and week 14 2024, the most frequent viral organisms (preceding, co-, or secondary infections) identified from respiratory specimens amongst persons with influenza were SARS-CoV-2, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and rhinovirus (Figure 55). SARS-CoV-2 was the most commonly detected pre-, co-, and secondary infection specimen, accounting for 47.0% of all pre-, co-, and secondary infections, followed by RSV, which accounted for 13.6%.

Most frequent respiratory viral specimens, by timing of diagnosis, in persons with influenza diagnosed in England between week 40 2023 and week 14 2024, [note 3] [note 3]: The baseline infection is any type of influenza (influenza A or B or both) for all viral preceding/co-/secondary infections except for influenza B where the baseline infection is influenza A. Virus characterisation England UKHSA characterises the properties of influenza viruses through one or more tests, including genome sequencing (genetic analysis) and haemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays (antigenic analysis). This data is used to compare how similar the currently circulating influenza viruses are to the strains included in seasonal influenza vaccines, and to monitor for changes in circulating influenza viruses. The interpretation of genetic and antigenic data sources is complex due to a number of factors, for example, not all viruses can be cultivated in sufficient quantity for antigenic characterisation, so that viruses with sequence information may not be able to be antigenically characterised as well. Occasionally, this can lead to a biased view of the properties of circulating viruses, as the viruses which can be recovered and analysed antigenically may not be fully representative of majority variants, and genetic characterisation data does not always predict the antigenic characterisation. Between week 40 2023 and week 16 2024, the UKHSA Respiratory Virus Unit have genetically characterised, by sequencing of the haemagglutinin (HA) gene, 2,072 influenza A viruses (925 A(H3N2) and 1,147 A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses) and 434 influenza B viruses. The 925 influenza A(H3N2) viruses genetically characterised all belong in the genetic clade 2 (formerly known as 3C.2a1b.2a.2). The Northern Hemisphere 2023 to 2024 season influenza Sequencing of the haemagglutinin (HA) gene shows that these influenza A(H3N2) viruses belong in clade 2a.3; defined by the amino acid changes clade 2a plus D53N, N96S (+CHO), and I192F in the HA gene. Two viruses have the additional HA substitution E50K (clade 2a.3a). Approximately 99.8% of characterised A(H3N2) viruses have the additional HA substitutions I140K and I223V (clade 2a.3a.1). A(H3N2) vaccine strain (an A/Darwin/9/2021-like virus) also belongs in genetic clade 2 but not the 2a.3a.1 subclade. The 1,147 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses characterised to date this season, all belong in genetic clade 5a.2 (formerly known as 6B.1A.5a.2). The Northern Hemisphere 2023 to 2024 season influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine strain (an A/Victoria/2570/2019-like virus) also belongs in this genetic clade. 86% of viruses characterised by sequencing of the haemagglutinin (HA) gene possessed the additional amino acid substitutions of clade 5a.2 plus K54Q, A186T, E224A, R259K and K308R (clade 5a.2a). 14% of characterised A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses have the additional HA substitutions P137S, K142R, D260E, T277A (subclade 5a.2a.1). 138 (86.8%) of the 5a.2a.1 viruses have also had the additional HA substitution T216A. The 434 influenza B/Victoria lineage viruses that have been genetically characterised, all belonging in clade V1A.3a.2. The Northern Hemisphere 2023 to 2024 season influenza B/Victoria lineage vaccine strain (a B/Austria/1359417/2021-like virus) also belongs in this clade. The first confirmed human case of influenza A(H1N2)v in England was detected in November 2023 through the RCGP sentinel surveillance scheme. Whole genome sequencing was undertaken directly from human clinical respiratory material and the sequence was consistent with a swine H1N2 virus belonging to 1B.1.1 HA clade. The neuraminidase (N2) and the internal gene segments all demonstrated a very close relationship to contemporary H1N2 swine influenza A viruses circulating in Great Britain with no evidence of a new reassortment. UKHSA conducted a rapid technical assessment and contact tracing, as well as enhanced surveillance in the York and Humber region, (by increased sentinel GP swabbing in the affected region and analysis of influenza A-positive samples from local hospitals). No further cases of A(H1N2)v were detected. The Respiratory Virus Unit has confirmed by genome sequencing the detection of LAIV viruses in 5 influenza A positive samples and 8 influenza B positive samples collected since week 40 2023, all from children aged between 2 and 16 years of age, consistent with known shedding characteristics of LAIV viruses as detailed in laboratory guidance. The WHO consultation on influenza vaccine composition for the Northern Hemisphere 2024 to 2025 season took place in February 2024. The recommendation is the use of trivalent vaccines for the use in the 2024 to 2025 northern hemisphere season, as follows. Egg-based vaccines: A/Victoria/4897/2022 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus A/Thailand/8/2022 (H3N2)-like virus (updated from previous composition) B/Austria/1359417/2021 (B/Victoria lineage)-like virus Cell culture- or recombinant-based vaccines: A/Wisconsin/67/2022 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus A/Massachusetts/18/2022 (H3N2)-like virus (updated from previous composition) B/Austria/1359417/2021 (B/Victoria lineage)-like virus Scotland Virus characterisation in Scotland is performed by the West of Scotland Specialist Virology Centre (WoSSVC) throughout the influenza season on a small number of influenza samples. Between week 40 2023 and week 14 2024, the 116 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses characterised all belong in genetic clade 5a.2 (formerly known as 6B.1A.5a.2); 54 belong to the Norway/25089/2022 strain and 62 to the Sydney/5/2021strain. The Northern Hemisphere the 2023 to 2024 season influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine strain (an A/Victoria/2570/2019-like virus) also belongs in this genetic clade. Between week 40 2023 and week 14 2024, the 88 influenza A(H3N2) viruses genetically characterised in Scotland, all belong in genetic clade 2 (formerly known as 3C.2a1b.2a.2), specifically the A/Darwin/9/2021 strain. A(H3N2) vaccine strain (an A/Darwin/9/2021-like virus) also belongs in genetic clade 2. There were 18 influenza B/Victoria lineage viruses genetically characterised, all belonging in clade V1A.3a.2. The Northern Hemisphere the 2023 to 2024 season influenza B/Victoria lineage vaccine strain (a B/Austria/1359417/2021-like virus) also belongs in this clade. Influenza antiviral susceptibility Influenza positive samples are genome sequenced and screened for mutations in the virus neuraminidase (NA) and the cap-dependent endonuclease (PA) genes known to confer neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI) or baloxavir marboxil resistance, respectively. The samples tested are routinely obtained for surveillance purposes, but diagnostic testing of patients suspected to be infected with antiviral-resistant virus is also performed. Influenza virus sequences from samples collected between weeks 40 2023 and 16 2024 have been analysed. Analysis of 897 A(H3N2) viruses by sequencing did not identify any oseltamivir resistant virus. Of the 1,144 A(H1N1)pdm09 NA sequences analysed by sequencing, 6 oseltamivir resistant viruses were found. These were taken from 5 patients: Patient 1: 2 samples with H275Y – immune compromised adult patient known to have received oseltamivir treatment Patient 2: one sample with H275Y – adult patient with COPD exacerbation known to have received oseltamivir treatment Patient 3: one sample with H275Y – immune compromised adult patient known to have received oseltamivir treatment Patient 4: one sample with D199E – immune compromised adult patient known to have received oseltamivir treatment Patient 5: one sample with H275Y – adult patient referred for resistance testing, clinical details pending Other mutations in the NA (I223V, S247N, I223V+S247N) known to cause low level reduction of sensitivity to NAIs were detected in several influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses (Table 2). The clinical relevance of these mutations is under investigation. One influenza B virus with an amino acid change (I221T) known to confer slightly reduced sensitivity to oseltamivir and peramivir was detected. There were no known markers of resistance to NAIs detected in further 431 influenza B NA sequences analysed. No viruses with known markers of resistance to baloxavir marboxil were detected in 799 A(H3N2), 941 A(H1N1)pdm09 and 370 influenza B PA sequences analysed. There were 2 influenza A(H3N2) viruses identified with a deletion of amino acids 37 to 38 and one influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus with a deletion of amino acids 35 to 45; virus isolation and further characterisation is underway.

Mortality Influenza-attributable deaths The FluMOMO model has been used by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) for many years to estimate influenza-related mortality, adjusting for extreme temperature, and is published in annual reports. However, with the COVID-19 pandemic leading to very large mortality levels from late March 2020, and with very little influenza circulation in 2020 to 2021 and 2021 to 2022 winters, models were not run in those years. For the 2022 to 2023 season, a new model was developed to incorporate COVID-19, details of which are given in the 2023 working paper. In the 2023 to 2024 season the new FluMOMO model was run using data from week 40 2012 to week 13 2024. Further details of the model for this season, with comparisons to the 2023 model are given in the 2024 working paper. Briefly, the model estimates attributable mortality based on the pattern of all cause deaths by week compared to that seen for influenza activity, extreme cold or heat and COVID-19 death certifications. It allows an estimate of attributable mortality irrespective of whether deaths are recorded as due to these factors. During the 2023 to 2024 season, influenza circulated at fairly low levels from mid-December 2023 to early March 2024. COVID-19 also circulated with waves throughout the period. There were periods of extreme cold with alerts issued. In 3 weeks, the mean weekly temperature was below 3°C, the threshold used in the FluMOMO model. Figure 59 represents the weekly number of all-age deaths and attribution to influenza, COVID-19 and extreme temperature covering the most recent 2 winters (week 40 2022 to 13 2024). The model demonstrates that in the winter of the 2023 to 2024 season excess mortality was fairly low with the greatest contributors on top of the baseline (grey) being COVID-19 (blue), followed by influenza (red) and cold weather (green) (Figure 59, Table 3 and Table 4). Influenza-related mortality for winter the 2023 to 2024 season is estimated at about 2,800 which is much lower than that seen in the 2022 to 2023 season and lower than all the pre-pandemic years in the model except 2013 to 2014. The adapted method is less suited to estimation for cold and the more recent Omicron COVID-19-related mortality as they tend not to cause sharp mortality spikes, but they are included and give a higher estimate of COVID-19 attributable mortality (approximately 5,500) than influenza for the season. For temperature-related mortality, the 1,400 estimate is based on 3 cold weeks and is lower than the 2022 to 2023 season which had some colder weeks than the 2023 to 2024 season. This estimate is contingent on the definition of cold used and only considers extreme cold rather than general cold which is captured in the baseline component of the model along with other seasonal factors not specifically included in the model.

Vaccination Seasonal influenza vaccine uptake in adults Although all countries of the UK use standardised specifications to extract vaccine uptake data from IT information systems in primary care (GP system suppliers), there are some differences in extraction specifications, so comparisons between nations should be made with caution. England In England, the uptake of seasonal influenza vaccine is monitored by UKHSA throughout the season based on weekly and monthly extracts from GP system suppliers via ImmForm for the cohorts primarily delivered via the GP practice. Cumulative uptake on influenza vaccinations administered up to 29 February 2024 was reported from 96.9% (6,152 out of 6,346) of GP practices in England in the 2023 to 2024 season. Comparative data is up to 28 February 2023 where vaccine uptake was reported from 97.1% (6,257 out of 6,447) of GP practices in England in the 2022 to 2023 season. This season saw a vaccine uptake of 77.8% in those aged 65 years and over (compared with 79.9% in the 2022 to 2023 season ) and 41.4% for those aged 6 months to under 65 years of age with one or more underlying clinical risk factors (excluding pregnant women without other risk factors and carers), compared with 49.1% in the 2022 to 2023 season. Vaccine uptake in pregnant women was 32.1%, compared with 35.0% in the 2022 to 2023 season (Table 5a). Scotland In Scotland, the uptake of seasonal influenza vaccine is estimated by PHS throughout the season, using a combination of aggregated data returns submitted by staff in all the territorial NHS boards on a weekly basis for those eligible in the following cohorts: 6 months to 2 years at risk, 2 to 5 years not at school, primary and secondary school pupils, and weekly extracts of data downloaded from the national clinical data store (NCDS) which contains individual-level data for adults eligible for flu vaccine, and for one NHS board, the data relating to the childhood schools’ and nurseries’ programmes. Please note pregnancy uptake data is not available for 2023 to 24. By the end of week 14, 2024 a total of 1,598,869 influenza vaccines were delivered to adults currently resident in Scotland corresponding to a 53.7% uptake. Among adults aged 65 years and older, 79.8% have been vaccinated against influenza during the current vaccination programme. Among at risk groups, 42.2% have been vaccinated against influenza. Figures (numerators and denominators) are representative of the current living Scottish population of each respective eligible cohort. Deaths and leavers from Scotland have been removed. Data is presented in Scotland’s weekly national respiratory report. Wales In Wales, the uptake of seasonal influenza vaccine is monitored on a weekly basis by Public Health Wales throughout the season based on automated weekly extracts of Read coded data using software installed in all General Practices through the Audit+ Data Quality System. Cumulative uptake data on influenza vaccinations administered were received from 100% of GP practices in Wales in the 2023 to 2024 season. This showed a vaccine uptake of 72.5% in the 65 years and over age group (compared to 76.3% in the 2022 to 2023 season ) and 39.1% for those aged 6 months to under 65 years of age with 1 or more underlying clinical risk factors, compared to 44.2% in the 2022 to 2023 season. Overall uptake in pregnant women was 60.9% compared to 60.0% in the 2022 to 2023 season. In Wales, vaccine coverage in pregnant women is measured using a survey of pregnant women giving birth each year during January. In addition, as elsewhere in the UK, data are also automatically collected from general practices for women with pregnancy related Read codes, these data report uptakes of 47.0% in pregnant women at risk and 33.7% in healthy pregnant women, however issues of denominator inflation in these measures mean that the figures are likely to be underestimates. Northern Ireland In Northern Ireland, the uptake of seasonal influenza vaccine is monitored by the Public Health Agency (PHA) of Northern Ireland. From 2021 to 2022 onwards influenza vaccine uptake has been determined using data extracted from regional Immunisation Information System developed by the Department of Health (DoH) Digital team, known as the Vaccine Management System (VMS). Caution should be used when considering influenza vaccination uptake rates from 2021 to 2022 in comparison to previous seasons, due to the introduction of the new VMS involving new methods of recording and extracting influenza vaccine data. In the population aged 65 years and older, uptake was 78.0% (compared to 83.0% in the 2022 to 2023 season ). Uptake was 31.1% in the population of 50-64 year olds in the 2023 to 2024 season, compared to 54.5% in the 2022 to 2023 season. Uptake figures may be subject to revision with improvements in data collection and reporting. Healthcare workers England In England, vaccine uptake among all frontline healthcare workers was 43.1% (Trusts and GP practices). In Trusts, vaccine uptake was 42.8% (from 93.6% of Trusts responding), a decrease from 49.9% vaccine uptake in the 2022 to 2023 season. In GP practice, vaccine uptake was 61.8% (from 9.9% of GP practices), a decrease from 66.3% vaccine uptake in the 2022 to 2023 season. Scotland In Scotland, in the 2023 to 2024 season, the combined uptake among health and social care workers was 42.2%, a decrease from 55.7% vaccine uptake in the 2022 to 2023 season. Wales In Wales, uptake reached 40.5% in the 2023 to 2024 season compared to 46.7% in the 2022 to 2023 season. Northern Ireland In Northern Ireland, uptake in frontline healthcare workers excluding social care was 24.8% in 2023 to 24. Uptake figures may be subject to revision with improvements in data collection and reporting. Vaccine uptake by country tables Table 5a.

Influenza vaccine programme for children England The influenza vaccine uptake in 2 and 3 year olds in England is monitored by UKHSA throughout the season, through weekly and monthly extracts from GP system suppliers via ImmForm. Cumulative vaccine uptake on influenza vaccinations administered up to 29 February 2024 was reported from 93.6% (5,934 out of 6,342) of GP practices in England in the 2023 to 2024 season. Comparative data is up to 28 February 2023 where vaccine uptake was reported from 98.4% (6,339 out of 6,442) of GP practices in England in the 2022 to 2023 season. This season saw a vaccine uptake for all GP-registered 2 year olds of 44.1% (compared with 42.3% in the 2022 to 2023 season) and was 44.6% in 3 year olds (compared with 45.1% in the 2022 to 2023 season ) in England. The combined uptake for 2 and 3 year olds was 44.4% compared with 43.7% in the 2022 to 2023 season. In the 2023 to 2024 season, school-aged children in year groups reception to year 11 (aged 4 to 16 years) were eligible for the influenza vaccine programme. There were differences in eligibility for the school-aged programme between the 2023 to 2024 season and the 2022 to 2023 season, as last season Years 10 and 11 were vaccinated subject to vaccine availability, and at a national level very little activity took place in these years groups. The programme was mainly delivered via a school-based route, with one area (Isle of Scilly) delivering vaccinations through general practice. Vaccine uptake was monitored through manual returns by local teams for their responsible population. An estimated 4,022,141 out of 8,063,277 eligible children in school years reception to year 11 in England received at least one dose of influenza vaccine during the period 1 September 2023 to 31 January 2024. The overall uptake was 49.9%. Vaccine uptake in all primary school age children (age 4 to 11 years old) was 55.1% compared with 56.3% in the 2022 to 2023 season (Table 6). Vaccine uptake in secondary school age children (age 11 to 16 years old) was 42.8% and due to differences in eligibility, data is not comparable to last season (Table 6). Vaccine uptake in children of school age generally decreases with increasing age. This trend has been seen in the previous seasons (Table 6 and Figure 60). Table 6.

Percentage influenza vaccine uptake for children in school years Reception to Year 6 (age 4 to 10 years rising to 11 years old) (primary school age), collected between 1 September 2023 to 31 January 2024, compared to the previous 4 seasons Overall vaccine uptake for all children of school age reception to year 11 (age 4 to 16 years old) by local authority (not shown here) ranged from 40.0% (491,957 out of 1,229,314) in London to 57.5% (514,133 out of 894,243) in East of England. Uptake by year group and local authority ranged from: 25.0% to 94.9% in reception 25.9% to 86.5% in year 1 24.7% to 91.6% in year 2 25.2% to 77.5% in year 3 23.2% to 79.5% in year 4 23.3% to 74.9% in year 5 22.5% to 74.4% in year 6 22.3% to 90.6% in year 7 17.0% to 79.6% in year 8 13.8% to 84.8% in year 9 13.2% to 79.4% in year 10 10.9% to 65.4% in year 11 Further detail on final influenza vaccine uptake data in all cohorts (GP patients, school-aged children and frontline healthcare workers) in England is publicly available. Scotland As previously described, the uptake of seasonal influenza vaccine in children is estimated by PHS throughout the season, using a combination of: aggregated data returns submitted by staff in all the territorial NHS boards on a weekly basis for those eligible in the following cohorts: 6 months to 2 years at risk, 2 to 5 years not at school, primary and secondary school pupils weekly extracts of data downloaded from the national clinical data store (NCDS) which contains individual-level data relating to the childhood schools’ and nurseries’ programmes for one NHS board The estimated uptake in preschool children (2 to under 5 years old, not yet in school) was 48.8% – this compares with 56.4% in the 2022 to 2023 season. For primary school children the estimated uptake was 69.0% compared with 74.7% in the 2022 to 2023 season. In secondary school children there was an estimated uptake of 52.9% compared with 61.0% in the 2022 to 2023 season. Note, caution should be taken when comparing uptake percentages between the seasons due to differences in data collection methods. Wales In Wales, immunisations for 2 and 3 year olds were delivered through general practices, apart from one health board where the majority of 3 year olds were immunised through nursery school immunisations sessions (uptake in these nursery school sessions was 54.5%). National uptake of influenza vaccine in 2 and 3 year olds decreased slightly in the 2023 to 2024 season. Uptake of influenza vaccine for children aged 2 years was 41.3% (compared to 42.9% in the 2022 to 2023 season ), for 3 year olds it was 44.1% (compared to 44.7% in the 2022 to 2023 season ). For the whole group of children aged 2 and 3 years, uptake was 42.8% (compared to 43.8% in the 2022 to 2023 season). The childhood influenza programme in Wales includes all primary and secondary school children. Uptake in school children decreased slightly. Primary school children aged 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 years, received their vaccinations in school immunisation sessions and uptake was 60.8%, 62.7%, 62.3%, 63.2%, 61.9%, 60.9% and 61.3% in each of these groups respectively. For the group as a whole, uptake was 61.9% (compared to 63.8% in the 2022 to 2023 season). Secondary school children aged 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 years, received their vaccinations in school immunisation sessions and uptake was 55.5%, 51.3%, 49.5%, 47.8% and 44.1% in each of these groups respectively. For the group as a whole, uptake was 49.7% (compared to 54.4% in the 2022 to 2023 season). Northern Ireland Caution should be used when considering influenza vaccination uptake rates from 2021 to 2022 in pre-school children in comparison to previous seasons, due to the introduction of the new VMS involving new methods of recording and extracting influenza vaccine data. Influenza vaccinations administered by Trust School Nursing Teams are recorded in the Child Health System (CHS), similar to previous seasons while GP administered vaccinations are recorded in VMS. In 2023 to 2024 the childhood influenza vaccination programme continued to include all pre-school children aged 2 to 4 years old, all primary school aged children (years 1 to 7) and post primary school children in years 8 to 12. The former group were offered vaccination through primary care, with the latter 2 groups offered vaccination through school health teams. The vaccination uptake rate in 2023 to 2024 for pre-school children aged 2 to 4 years old was 32.9% (compared to 33.0% in 2023 to 2023). The vaccination uptake rate for children in primary school (aged approximately 4 to 11 years old) was 68.6% (compared to 70.7% in 2022 to 2023). In 2021 to 2022, Northern Ireland expanded the vaccination programme from all year 8 children (introduced in 2020 to 2021) to include post-primary school children (years 8 to 12) with an uptake rate of 56.5% in 2023 to 2024. In 2022 to 2023, uptake within this group was 61.0%. These year groups were vaccinated through school clinics and a small number by GP. Uptake figures may be subject to revision with improvements in data collection and reporting. Vaccine effectiveness Vaccine effectiveness against acute respiratory infection presenting in primary care In England, Scotland and Wales for the 2023 to 2024 season, influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) was estimated using a test-negative study design. VE is presented against influenza in those presenting within primary care with symptoms of acute respiratory infection. Infection data were collected through 3 sentinel GP-based swabbing schemes in England (RCGP), Scotland (CARI) and Wales (as described in the microbiological surveillance section of this report). Vaccination status of study participants was obtained through questionnaire at the time of swabbing (Wales) or data linkage with immunisation databases (England, Scotland) and GP records (England). In children aged 2 to 17 years, the overall adjusted influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) in the 2023 to 2024 season was 54% (95% confidence interval (CI): 45% to 61%) against all laboratory confirmed influenza (Figure 61). In adults aged 18 to 64 years, the overall VE was 49% (95% CI: 42% to 56%) against all laboratory confirmed influenza. In adults aged 65 years and over, the overall VE was 46% (95% CI: 29% to 59%). In subtype-specific analyses across the age groups, moderate VE was demonstrated against influenza A(H1N1) and A(H3N2). Protection against influenza B was good in children and adults aged 18 to 64 years, but it was not possible to estimate VE in adults aged 65 years and over due to low case numbers. Figure 61. Adjusted vaccine effectiveness against acute respiratory infection presentation in primary care with laboratory-confirmed influenza, by influenza subtype and age group, 2023 to 2024 season, England, Scotland and Wales [note 16][note 17] [note 16]: Adjusted for week of sample, age group, sex, nation, clinical risk status. [note 17]: it was not possible to estimate VE against influenza B in adults aged 65 years and over due to low case numbers. Vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization England In England for the 2023 to 2024 season influenza VE was also estimated using a test-negative study design against hospitalization. VE is presented against influenza in those requiring hospitalisation with a diagnosis consistent with acute respiratory infection in England during the period week 40 2023 to week 11 2024. Infection and admission data was collected through the Respiratory DataMart surveillance scheme and Secondary Uses Service (SUS) data. Vaccination status of study participants was obtained through data linkage with the Immunisation Information System (IIS). In children aged 2 to 17 years, the overall adjusted VE in the 2023 to 2024 season was 54% (95% CI: 42% to 63%) against all laboratory confirmed influenza. In adults aged 18 to 64 years, the overall VE was 31% (95% CI: 21% to 40%) against all laboratory confirmed influenza. In adults aged 65 years and over, the overall VE was 30% (95% CI: 22% to 37%). Overall VE reflects protection against influenza A, which predominated. However, only a proportion of influenza A positive samples were further subtyped, hence there was greater uncertainty in subtype-specific VE analyses across the age groups. Moderate VE was demonstrated against A(H1N1). Low to moderate VE was demonstrated against influenza A(H3N2), but confidence intervals crossed zero in adults aged 18-64. Protection against influenza B was good in children but uncertain in adults due to low case numbers- in those aged 65 years and above there was insufficient data to estimate vaccine effectiveness (Figure 62). Figure 62. Adjusted vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisation with a diagnosis consistent with an acute respiratory infection and laboratory-confirmed influenza by influenza subtype and age group, the 2023 to 2024 season, England [note 18][note 19] [note 18]: It was not possible to estimate VE against influenza B in adults aged 65 years and over due to low case numbers. [note 19]: Adjusted for week of sample, age group, UKHSA region, clinical risk status. Scotland In Scotland, in the 2023 to 2024 season, influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) was measured using a test-negative study design. VE is presented against influenza hospitalisation among individuals admitted to hospital, as an emergency admission, with a respiratory related diagnosis. This study estimated the odds of testing positive for influenza among vaccinated individuals compared to unvaccinated individuals in a hospitalised population, as a measure of vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisation. The analysis was performed through the data linkage of influenza testing data from the Electronic Communication of Surveillance in Scotland (ECOSS), hospital admission data from Scottish Morbidity Records 01 (SMR01) database and vaccination status of patients from the national clinical data store (NCDS). Study period for the analysis was 3 October 2023 to 29 March 2024. In children aged 2 to 17 years, the overall adjusted VE in the 2023 to 2024 season was 74% (95% CI 63% to 81%) against hospitalisation with a respiratory condition and any laboratory-confirmed influenzas. In adults aged 18 to 64 years, the overall VE was 48% (95% CI 38% to 55%) and in adults aged 65 years and over, overall VE was 41% (95% CI 33% to 49%). For all influenza types VE was higher in children than older age groups. In subtype-specific analyses across the age groups, moderate to high VE was demonstrated against influenza A(H3N2) for those aged 2 to 17 years, and aged 65 years and over. High VE was observed against influenza A(H1N1) for those aged 2 to 17 years and 18 to 64 years. High VE was found against influenza B in those aged 2 to 17 years and 18 to 64 years; however, these results should be interpreted with caution due to low circulation of influenza B in the study period resulting in wide confidence intervals. For those aged 65 years and above there was insufficient data to estimate VE against influenza B (Figure 63). Figure 63. Estimated vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisation with a respiratory condition and laboratory confirmed influenza by subtype and age group, the 2023 to 2024 season, Scotland [note 20][note 21] [note 20]: It was not possible to estimate VE against influenza B in adults aged 65 years and over due to low case numbers. [note 21]: Adjusted for time during season, age, sex, deprivation and number of clinical risk groups. Avian and other zoonotic influenza Avian influenza A(H5N1) Since 2003 and up to 24 May 2024, over 890 human cases of avian influenza A(H5N1) have been reported worldwide with a case fatality ratio of over 50%. Since 2020, the avian influenza A(H5N1) clade 2.3.4.4b has become widespread in birds, with some limited spillover to non-avian species and rare detections in humans. On 25 March 2024, the US reported an outbreak of avian influenza A(H5N1) clade 2.3.4.4b, genotype B3.13 in dairy cattle, and one associated human case. The human case had exposure to cattle presumed to be infected with the virus on a commercial dairy cattle farm in Texas and developed conjunctivitis before recovering. A second human case was reported on 22 May 2024, in an individual in Michigan who also had exposure to infected dairy cattle. Influenza A infection is exceptionally rare in cows, and avian influenza virus infection of cattle has never been seen. The US outbreak is ongoing, with confirmed A(H5N1) genotype B3.13 detections now reported across 9 states. This specific genotype has not been detected in birds or mammals outside of the US. In the UK, an ongoing enhanced surveillance study of asymptomatic workers exposed to poultry infected with avian influenza identified 4 human detections of influenza A(H5N1) clade 2.3.4.4b from 3 geographically distinct sites in 2023. The last human detection in the UK was in July 2023 and on 29 March 2024. The UK self-declared zonal freedom from highly pathogenic avian influenza. Avian influenza zoonoses summary In 2021 there was an increase in detections of both influenza A(H5N6) and influenza A(H9N2) in humans, internationally, with sporadic detections continuing to date. Up to 24 May 2024 there have been 91 laboratory-confirmed cases of A(H5N6) in humans, with the most recent case reported from China with onset on 13 April 2024. Up to 24 May 2024 there have been at least 99 laboratory-confirmed cases of A(H9N2) in humans, including 2 deaths, reported since 2015. The latest case was reported from Vietnam with an onset date of 10 March 2024. Most human cases of avian influenza viruses are exposed through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments, including live poultry markets or domestically kept birds. Since the viruses continue to be detected in animals and environments, further human cases can be expected, however current epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that these viruses have not acquired the ability to undergo sustained transmission among humans. It is important to ensure that imported cases of suspect avian influenza are detected promptly to ensure public health measures including infection control can be rapidly put in place to minimise any risk of onward transmission. Swine influenza zoonoses summary On 25 November 2023, UKHSA notified the WHO of a human case of swine-origin influenza A(H1N2)v clade 1B.1.1, detected in England through routine community respiratory virus surveillance. The case fully recovered. While similar viruses have been detected in pigs in England, and the case lived in a region with pig farms, no direct contact between the case and pigs was reported. No other confirmed cases associated with the event were reported. There continue to be some sporadic reports internationally of human infections with swine influenza viruses such as influenza A(H3N2)v, influenza A(H1N1)v and influenza A(H1N2)v. Close contact with infected pigs or attendance at sites such as farms and agricultural fairs continue to pose an exposure risk. Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infections Since the World Health Organization (WHO) first reported cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in April 2012, a total of 2,613 laboratory confirmed cases have been reported globally to WHO up to April 2023. This includes 941 fatal cases (case fatality ratio of 36%). The majority of these cases have occurred in countries in the Arabian Peninsula. A feature of MERS-CoV is its ability to cause large outbreaks within healthcare settings. Local secondary transmission following importation has been reported from several countries including the UK, France, Tunisia, and the Republic of Korea. A total of 5 cases of MERS-CoV (3 imported and 2 linked cases) have been confirmed in the UK through ongoing surveillance since September 2012. In April and May 2014, 2 laboratory confirmed cases transited through London Heathrow Airport on separate flights to the US. Contact tracing of flight contacts did not identify any further cases. Further information on management and guidance of possible cases is available online. The latest ECDC MERS-CoV risk assessment highlights that risk of widespread transmission of MERS-CoV remains very low. General comments on methodology The moving epidemic method (MEM) is used by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) to standardise reporting of influenza activity across Europe. It has been adopted by the UK and is presented for GP ILI consultation rates for each UK scheme and for the hospitalisation and ICU admissions rate through the SARI Watch scheme. Thresholds of influenza activity intensity using historic data. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the MEM thresholds were calculated using historic data from past 5 seasons. However, due to low circulation of influenza due to measures put in place during the COVID-19 pandemic, seasons 2020 to 2021 and 2021 to 2022 were excluded from the calculations. Measures put in place during the COVID-19 pandemic affected the transmission of influenza and other respiratory viruses during this period. Although these restrictions and interventions were lifted by the 2022 to 2023 season influenza season, lasting changes in hand hygiene, healthcare-seeking patterns and social distancing measures continue to be important to consider when interpreting the surveillance indicators presented in this report, particularly when comparing to pre-pandemic seasons.

Henderson Published September 6, 2024 at 5:42 PM CDT Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email Cynthia Goldsmith / CDCThe Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services detected the first human case of H5 Bird Flu in Missouri. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed the case. Infection transmission among the public remains low. The Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services detected the first human case of H5 bird flu in the state, and the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed the infection Friday.The state’s health department was alerted of the infection through its ongoing influenza surveillance program. The patient was hospitalized on Aug. 22 and tested positive for influenza A. The patient has since recovered.H5 bird flu is typically found in poultry, wild birds and more recently dairy cows. People can be infected when in close contact with infected animals. The patient reported no exposure to animals. There are no bird flu infections in dairy cows reported in the state; however, some outbreaks in wild birds and commercial or backyard flocks have been reported.This is the first case of H5 bird flu that has been detected across the nation through the influenza surveillance system. Since 2022, there have been 15 human cases of bird flu reported, and it is the 14th human case this year.The CDC says there is low risk of public transmission or infection.

Over 43.4 million hens were depopulated in 2022, with March being the month with the most bird losses at 16.91 million over eight flocks. Following March 2022 were April at 10.7 million layers over 10 flocks, September at 4.9 million layers over two flocks and December at 3.9 million layers over four flocks.Courtesy Denise O'KeefeEven though there are approximately four months left in 2024, this year has seen more layer hen depopulations than has 2023. In 2024, almost 17.2 million layers have been depopulated due to HPAI outbreaks. Only three months have been impacted this year including, April at 8.4 million layers over four flocks, May at 5.7 million layers over two flocks and July at 3.1 million layers over two flocks.In 2023, the U.S. layer industry did not see an HPAI outbreak in one of its flocks until November, which involved 5.1 million birds over five flocks. In December, almost 7.8 million layers were depopulated over 11 flocks.U.S. free of HPAI since mid-July 2024The U.S. poultry industry has not seen a commercial case of HPAI in approximately six weeks. The last case confirmed by USDA APHIS occurred on July 19, 2024, in a flock of 300,800 commercial table egg pullets in Weld County, Colorado. HPAI cases on July 24 and August 5 were confirmed this year in non-commercial flocks in Florida, but will not have an impact on international trade, according to World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) standards.View our continuing coverage of the global avian influenza situation.

After recovering, the patient was discharged, and no further personal information will be disclosed to protect privacy.H5 bird flu typically affects wild birds and poultry, occasionally infecting humans through close contact with infected animals or contaminated environments.This case is the fifteenth H5 human infection in the U.S. since 2022 and the first identified through standard flu surveillance rather than targeted outbreak monitoring.There have been no H5 infections in Missouri’s dairy cattle, though some cases have been reported in bird flocks and wild birds. DHSS continues to monitor influenza activity closely, with no unusual increases in flu cases or emergency room visits reported statewide.Health officials assure the public that measures are in place to maintain safety and prevent further transmission.COPYRIGHT 2024 BY KOAM NEWS NOW.

In October 2023, British researchers confirmed for the first time the presence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic regions. The strain detected in remote South Georgia and the Falkland Islands was HPAI H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b, the virus responsible for the global animal pandemic that has caused the death and destructions of millions of wild and domestic animals. The initial viral genome sequences were made freely available months ago. Now, a full documentation of the extensive field sampling and diagnostic testing, published in Nature Communications, has revealed the virus spread from South America, likely through migratory wild birds. The study details the virus’ initial detection in brown skuas in South Georgia inside the Antarctic region, followed by its rapid spread across multiple avian species and 2 seal species. It was simultaneously detected in southern fulmar and black-browed albatross in the Falkland Islands archipelago 1,500km to the west. A brown skua (Stercorarius antarcticus). Credit: Ashley Bennison Dr Jane Younger, a lecturer in Southern Ocean vertebrate ecology at University of Tasmania in Australia, who was not involved in the research, says HPAI in the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic regions is an alarming development, underscoring the vulnerability of these remote ecosystems to infectious diseases. “The recent study … provides critical insight into how migratory birds may act as vectors for the virus to enter new regions,” says Younger. Read More Body and Mind Are we prepared for it if bird flu starts spreading between humans? “In this case, the virus most likely spread to South Georgia and the Falklands from South America, where infections have killed tens of thousands of seabirds and marine mammals. This raises significant concerns about the potential spread of the virus to other areas of Antarctica, especially during the upcoming Antarctic seabird breeding season. “This heightens fears that the virus could spread to more isolated regions via migrating birds and mammals.” Confirmed and suspected cases of HPAI in the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic are reported through the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR). Dr Michelle Wille, of the Centre for Pathogen Genomics at the University of Melbourne, Australia who was not involved in the research, says the last reported case in the Antarctic region was in March 2024, at the end of the tourist and research season. A map of Antarctica and the surrounding oceans, showing the Antarctic South Georgia and the sub-Antarctic Falkland Islands in the top left. Credit: Hogweard CC BY-SA 3.0 “This article is extremely timely, given that research teams (and tourists) will soon be returning to the Antarctic region for the austral summer season,” says Wille. “The data provides critical insights into virus introduction and spread, which will be integrated into continued and future preparation and response activities in Antarctica.” Crucially, genome analysis reveals no evidence yet of virus transmission between infected marine mammals. “Given the concern around potential mammal-to-mammal transmission in marine mammals in South America, it is encouraging that the full genome sequences from elephant seals and a fur seal did not contain any PB2 mutations of interest,” says Wille. Dr Vinod Balasubramaniam, a molecular virologist at Monash University Malaysia, who was not involved in the research, adds: “The study did not find any unique adaptive mutations in the Antarctic strains that would increase the risk to human populations compared to other global instances of H5N1 infections. “This finding is crucial because H5N1 is known for its potential to cause severe disease in humans, and mutations that increase transmissibility or virulence could pose significant public health risks. Monitoring the genetic composition of the virus is essential to detect any changes that might enhance its threat to humans or wildlife.” Originally published by Cosmos as How avian influenza has spread to Antarctic islands You Might Like Birds Birds without borders: a dive into the archives Birds Bin chickens love bins, say scientists Birds Common ancestor of all birds was probably iridescent Birds Tree of life for modern birds reveals rapid increase in diversity 66 million years ago Loading next article...

Fourteen states and 197 herds have now been affected by the unprecedented outbreak in dairy cows, which was first confirmed by federal health officials on March 25. In a statement, the secretary of the California Department of Food and Agriculture, Karen Ross, said the spread of the virus to California was not unexpected. "We have been preparing for this possibility since earlier this year when [Highly pathogenic avian influenza or HPAI] detections were confirmed at dairy farms in other states," Ross said. "Our extensive experience with HPAI in poultry has given us ample preparation and expertise to address this incident, with workers’ health and public health as our top priorities." Virus on the move The herds in California are thought to have been infected through the movement of cattle, despite a federal order mandating testing of cattle prior to movement between states. So far, health officials believe that all of the dairy infections across the affected states stem from a single spillover event from wild birds to dairy cows in Texas. The virus is thought to spread from cow to cow, as well as from contaminated milking equipment, hands, and boots. Wild bird populations worldwide have been devastated by H5N1 in recent years, with its spread in the US first documented in 2022. But, unlike past avian influenza outbreaks in wild bird populations, the current strain of H5N1 spreading—clade 2.3.4.4b—has proven unusually adept at spilling over to various mammals. For instance, the US dairy outbreak marked the first time the virus was documented to cause an outbreak among cows. Since the beginning of the US dairy cow outbreak, federal officials have suggested that they are well-equipped to stop the spread. However, the tally of affected herds has continued to increase, with 17 herds reported infected in the last 30 days, according to the US Department of Agriculture. The state with the most affected herds—64—is Colorado, the only state to mandate bulk milk testing for H5N1. Since that July 22 mandate, the state has identified 11 infected herds through bulk testing. Overall, testing for H5N1 is limited, and experts believe that official tallies of infected herds are significant undercounts. Reassortment risk For now, the risk to the general population is still considered to be low, and the virus does not pose a risk via pasteurized milk and dairy products or properly cooked meat. The influenza virus is readily inactivated by heat treatments. The risk is also relatively low for the infected cows, most of which make full recoveries within a few weeks. Farm workers exposed to infected animals are at risk of contracting the virus, however. To date, four dairy farm workers and 10 poultry farm workers have contracted the bird flu virus behind the dairy outbreak. The infections have been mild so far, with some having only inflamed eyes and others having classic flu symptoms. Officials have not seen evidence of the virus spreading from human to human in any of those cases. However, experts fear that the continued adaptation to mammals and exposure to humans will give the virus ample opportunities to shift to a more dangerous, more transmissible virus, potentially one that could spark the next pandemic. The concern was evident in a July 30 press briefing when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced a $5 million effort to get farm workers vaccinated against seasonal flu. The fear is that farm workers could become human mixing bowls for H5N1 and the seasonal flu strains this year. Influenza viruses are notorious for undergoing reassortment, a process in which different strains of flu viruses can exchange segments of their genomes with each other when they co-infect a host. This can create genetically distinct strains, potentially ones with new abilities. By vaccinating farm workers against seasonal flu, health officials hope to keep the bird flu and human-adapted seasonal flu from commingling.

Courtesy County News Center The annual flu season is set to begin soon, and it looks like this year’s might be a big one. American researchers typically look to Australia for clues about how severe the upcoming flu season might be, as influenza typically spreads there during the Northern Hemisphere’s spring and summer months. This year, Australia has had an active flu season, with case numbers running at their highest levels since before the COVID-19 pandemic years. And once again, surges of COVID and respiratory syncytial virus are anticipated while influenza is spreading across the United States this fall and winter, putting even more strain on health systems. Flu vaccines are now widely available across the county, but they are not the only line of defense. “Vaccination isn’t the only thing you can do to protect yourself and others around you from infection,” said Dr. Anthony Chong, a family medicine physician and chief medical officer at Scripps Coastal Medical Center.

Beyond the physical discomfort and schedule disruptions that a routine flu infection can bring, the virus also can be deadly. During the 2023-24 flu season, the virus infected more than 19,000 people in San Diego County and killed 60 people locally. Across the United States, as many as 64 million people were sickened by influenza, and as many as 72,000 died. This year’s flu vaccine will be a bit different, however — for the first time since 2013, the shot no longer contains protection against the B/Yamagata family of viruses, which has not been seen anywhere in the world since it disappeared in 2020 during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, when global infection mitigation efforts largely sidelined influenza from circulation.

From: Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs and Animal and Plant Health Agency Published 2 September 2024 Bird keepers are today (2 September) being reminded that there is now one month to go until new measures to better protect the poultry sector from future avian influenza outbreaks are in place. This includes a legal deadline which comes into force on 1 October for all bird keepers – regardless of the size of their flock – to officially register themselves with the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA), if they have not already done so. Registering your birds is important in the prevention and control of notifiable avian disease outbreaks (such as avian influenza and Newcastle disease). The register is used to communicate with keepers to inform them about measures they need to take to protect the health of their birds and to prevent the spread of disease. The new rules cover owners of backyard flocks, birds of prey and pigeon fanciers, but do not affect caged pet birds (excluding any poultry species) kept entirely inside a domestic dwelling, such as a parrot, canary or budgie, which never leaves the property other than to visit a vet or another short-term period. The information will also be used to identify all bird keepers in disease control zones, allowing for more effective completion of surveillance activities, so that zones can be lifted at the earliest possible opportunity enabling trade to resume swiftly following an outbreak of avian disease in Great Britain. For bird keepers who have already registered and whose details haven’t changed, there’s no action needed. For those looking to update an existing registration and who already have a CPH number, please contact the APHA registration team directly by phone or email Customer.Registration@apha.gov.uk. Deputy Chief Veterinary Officer, Ele Brown said: The legal deadline for bird keepers to register with the Animal and Plant Health Agency is now less than one month away. These measures are an important step which will enhance monitoring and understanding of the disease, combatting the spread of avian influenza in Great Britain. The registration requirements will support better collaboration between bird keepers and government, with keepers informed of measures to take to protect the health of their birds. All poultry, whether a large commercial flock or a few backyard pets, are at risk of infectious diseases. This approach will improve our resilience to future pandemics. Richard Griffiths, British Poultry Council Chief Executive, said: Registration is a tool to have in the toolbox, allowing birdkeepers and Government to work together to track and combat avian influenza. Alongside stringent biosecurity, registration means all birdkeepers should receive important updates and timely communication, amplifying efforts to safeguard bird health as we move into the colder months. The UK has self-declared freedom from HPAI for Great Britain with effect from 29 March 2024. There are currently no outbreaks of HPAI in poultry or other captive birds in the UK. However, HN51 continues to be found in wild birds in Great Britain and across Europe and keepers should remain vigilant and practice stringent biosecurity to protect the health and welfare of their birds.

California hosts a fifth of the nation's dairy cows, and it is the number one producer of milk, butter, and ice cream, and the number two producer of cheese and yogurt in the US. A CDFA statement assures the public that the state's supply of pasteurized milk and dairy products remains safe for consumption, but an outbreak of bird flu at three different dairy farms is an event officials are not taking lightly. "We have been preparing for this possibility since earlier this year when HPAI detections were confirmed at dairy farms in other states," says CDFA Secretary Karen Ross. "Our extensive experience with HPAI in poultry has given us ample preparation and expertise to address this incident, with workers' health and public health as our top priorities. This is a tough time for our dairy farmers given the economic challenges they're facing in a dynamic market, so I want to assure them that we are approaching this incident with the utmost urgency." The current infections of HPAI among cattle in the US started in March, when a 'mysterious' illness broke out among dairy cows in Texas, causing thick and discolored milk. These cows were the first in the world to officially test positive for the bird flu virus. Thankfully, the infection seems to be non-lethal, but it does cause a temporary drop in milk production for a week or more. Officials still don't know how the virus is transmitted from cow to cow, but it's possibly spreading through contaminated milking machines. Only if dairy milk is raw or unpasteurized does it pose a threat to humans. Since March, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) reports that 197 cattle in total have tested positive for bird flu in no less than 14 states, including Kansas, Michigan, Idaho, Ohio, Colorado, South Dakota, Minnesota, Oklahoma, Iowa, Wyoming, and New Mexico.Confirmed cases of HPAI in livestock as of 30 August 2024. (APHIS/USDA)In the last 30 days alone, there have been 17 confirmed cases of bird flu among dairy cows in four states. On 30 August 2024, three livestock herds in California joined the list. Colorado, meanwhile, is dealing with an outbreak among 12 livestock herds. At the moment, no domestic poultry flocks are affected by the avian flu in California, which suggests the cows were infected not via birds but from their own kind.No human cases have been detected in the state, but public health officials urge dairy workers to remain vigilant and to wear protective equipment while handling raw milk.

Share this item with your network: By Veronica Salib, Associate Editor Published: 03 Sep 2024 Last week, the CDC released its 2024-2025 respiratory disease season outlook, indicating that the upcoming fall and winter respiratory virus season will produce similar or lower peak numbers of hospitalizations. The organization's outlook focused on three primary respiratory infections, including COVID-19, influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Predictions about the upcoming respiratory virus season were formed using input from experts, historical data, and scenario modeling from the Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics. While the organization acknowledges the inherent uncertainty associated with longitudinal predictions, it offers insights and justifications for its forecasts in the upcoming seasons. First, the public health organization examined the combined peak hospitalization burden of COVID-19, influenza and RSV. Analysts made predictions for the 20204-2025 season based on three scenarios relative to the 2023:2024 season. A similar peak would be defined as a combined peak hospitalization burden in 2024-2025 within 20% (either greater or lower) of the combined peak hospitalization burden in 2023-2024. A lower peak would be a significantly lower combined peak hospitalization burden in 2024-2025 (20% lower or more). Finally, a higher peak would be 20% higher or more than the combined peak hospitalization burden in 2023-2024. According to the data presented in the outlook report, CDC experts predict that there is a roughly 80% chance that the combined peak hospitalization burden of COVID-19, influenza, and RSV will be similar to or lower than last season. There is a 54% probability of a similar peak and a 28% probability of a lower peak. The data estimates an 18% chance that the peak will be higher this season. Looking at independent data for each condition, the CDC depicts two scenarios for COVID-19. In the first scenario, the summer COVID-19 hospitalization rate does not peak before the start of respiratory virus season. In this case, the CDC anticipates that the fall and winter COVID-19 hospitalization rates will peak at 7.2-9.7 hospitalizations per 100,000 in late December. However, the second scenario paints a more promising picture, in which the summer COVID-19 hospitalization rates peak before the respiratory season begins. In this case, the CDC estimates that the respiratory season wave could be smaller, peaking at 4.2-58 hospitalizations per 100,000 in mid-January. Regarding influenza, the CDC predicts a peak hospitalization rate similar to or lower than 8.9 weekly laboratory-confirmed hospitalizations per 100,000, which was the peak in the 2023-2024 respiratory disease season. These predictions are based mainly on estimates for the influenza vaccine this season. For example, experts hypothesize that the annual influenza vaccine will be 33% to 50% effective at protecting against infection. Additionally, estimated vaccine uptake for adults 18 and older ranges from 42% to 44%. Finally, focusing on RSV, the CDC estimates similar or lower rates than the 2023-2024 season level of 4.2 weekly laboratory-confirmed hospitalizations per 100,000. Although RSV vaccines are currently only recommended for vulnerable populations, such as the elderly, infants and pregnant individuals, the CDC predicts that vaccine uptake will contribute to similar or lower hospitalization rates. Although the availability of prevention tools and current viral trends have informed the CDC's prediction that 2024-2025 hospitalization peaks will be similar to or lower than the previous year, certain factors might contribute to higher rates. For example, new strains of COVID-19 or the predominance of different influenza subtypes could skew predictions. Additionally, lower vaccine uptake or effectiveness could contribute to higher rates. Despite these predictions, following the appropriate public health guidelines and getting vaccinated will be critical to protecting against respiratory viruses this season.

Opens in a new tab or window Share on X. Opens in a new tab or window Share on LinkedIn. Opens in a new tab or window email article In this video interview, Paul Offit, MD, of Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and a member of FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, gives recommendations for who should get the lineup of fall vaccines this year. The following is a transcript of his remarks: The goal of the COVID vaccine is to keep people out of the hospital and out of the intensive care unit. So the critical question then is: who's getting hospitalized? Who's getting hospitalized with COVID? And the answer is, it generally falls into four high-risk groups. One are people who are elderly, which is to say those over 75. Two are people who are immune compromised either because they were born with certain immune deficiencies or they're taking drugs that suppress their immune system because of cancers or rheumatologic disease. Three are people who are pregnant. And four are people who have high-risk medical conditions like obesity, diabetes, chronic lung disease, chronic heart disease. So that's who you're trying to keep out of the hospital. And so if you look at the data in terms of the ability of these yearly vaccines to keep people out of the hospital, they're about 50% to 55% effective in the first few months, assuming the strain is matched to the circulating strain. So that is valuable. Novavax is a purified protein vaccine that has a relatively long reduction cycle, about 6 months. They had to make a decision about what strain to include earlier than the manufacturers of the mRNA vaccines, Pfizer and Moderna. So they chose the so-called JN.1 strain because that's what was the predominant strain circulating at the time that they had to make a decision to have a September rollout. In June, the FDA Vaccine Advisory Committee met and ultimately the decision was made to use the KP.2 strain in the two mRNA vaccines. So the Novavax [vaccine] has JN.1, the two mRNA vaccines, Pfizer and Moderna, have KP.2. Is there a functional difference? Not really. I mean, KP.1 and KP.2 and KP.3 and KP.3.1.1 are all derivatives of JN.1, so there's a lot of cross-reactivity. I think functionally it really doesn't make any difference which of those two vaccines you get. It will be interesting to see what happens with Novavax this year because Novavax has generally been slow to market, so you don't have a lot of comparisons between Novavax and mRNA vaccines in terms of longevity of protection and also degree of protection. Hopefully, we'll get those kind of data this year. Influenza, like respiratory syncytial virus, is basically a winter respiratory pathogen. So it's important to get the influenza vaccine before the winter season. Same thing with RSV, it's important with respiratory syncytial virus to get it before the winter season. Now, the influenza vaccine is recommended for everybody over 6 months of age. I'm definitely getting my influenza vaccine before the winter starts. The RSV vaccine is recommended for adults who are either over 75 years of age or who are 60 to 75 years of age and have high-risk medical conditions like obesity, diabetes, chronic lung disease, chronic heart disease. So that's who the RSV vaccine is recommended for. Those two viruses are winter viruses; therefore, you need to get that vaccine before the winter starts. COVID has been surprising. I think everyone assumed that COVID would settle into a winter respiratory pattern, but that really hasn't happened yet. It still occurs year-round. So if you get the vaccine before the winter, you know you're going to be protected against what is invariably a winter peak. But that immunity will fade to some extent 4 to 6 months later, and the virus will still circulate and cause disease even in summer months. I'm going to get an influenza vaccine probably in October. I'm not going to get an RSV vaccine because I'm not over 75 and I'm not in a high-risk group for those less than 75. I am going to get a COVID vaccine this year because I'm getting close to 75. I really haven't had a COVID vaccine since the Wuhan strain. I had three doses of the Wuhan strain and I've had one natural infection, which I think frankly gives me a high frequency of memory B and T cells, which are likely to protect me -- especially memory T cells, which can then become activated and become cytotoxic T cells -- and that is very much an important immunological component in protection against severe disease. That's my goal. My goal is to keep myself out of the hospital. I assume I'm going to get a mild or moderate infection as the years go on, but I just want to stay out of the hospital.

Facebook Twitter Whatsapp Whatsapp Copy link Chickens on a poultry farmUlises Ruiz / AFP. Published by Sabrina Martin Verified by 7 de septiembre, 2024 Topics: bird flu A person in Missouri tested positive for H5N1 avian flu without having had known contact with infected animals, health officials said. This is the first case in the United States of an infection in an individual without direct exposure to birds or other affected animals.Case details.The patient, an adult with underlying health conditions, was admitted to the hospital on August 22. He received antiviral treatment and was discharged after recovery. Tests confirmed H5N1 infection after an initial test indicated the presence of the virus. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed that no transmission of the virus to close contacts or others has been detected.The Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services indicated that no infections have been reported in dairy cattle in the state. However, cases have been reported in poultry and wild birds.Surveillance and recommendationsThe World Health Organization (WHO) welcomed the identification of the case by the national surveillance system and the absence of additional infections among close contacts. However, Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO's director of epidemic and pandemic preparedness and prevention, stressed the importance of continuing investigations into the patient's exposure and emphasized the importance of enhanced animal disease surveillance to protect both animal and human health.Context and riskAlthough human cases of avian influenza are rare, scientists are concerned about the increase in mammalian infections and the potential risk of virus mutations that could facilitate human-to-human transmission. So far, cases in the country have been limited primarily to agricultural workers. Currently, the CDC assesses the risk to the public as low but cautions that the situation could change as more information becomes available.

Posted inEnvironmental Health State agricultural, veterinary officials stay on the lookout for bird flu in NC cattle Ag commissioner Steve Troxler gave North Carolina farmers a chance to hear from agricultural and veterinary officials about the national outbreak and what that means for them. by Rose Hoban September 4, 2024September 4, 2024 FacebookTwitterLinkedInEmail NC State Agriculture Commissioner Steve Troxler (left) speaks with Robert Califf (middle), commissioner for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration during a conversation last week about highly pathogenic avian influenza at the state fairgrounds. U.S. Department of Agriculture undersecretary Eric Deeble (right) looks on. Credit: Rose Hoban By Rose Hoban In April, North Carolina’s agricultural officials received an unwelcome surprise. Cows in one of the state’s dairy herds tested positive for a strain of avian influenza that’s been appearing in herds throughout the United States since the spring. State veterinarian Mike Martin relayed the story of how North Carolina discovered the information during a recent gathering of 150 farmers, county and state agricultural officials, and federal regulators at a panel discussion convened by N.C. Agricultural Commissioner Steve Troxler. Martin said his office knew cows from the Texas panhandle where the outbreak was first identified had been transported to North Carolina and that routine testing for the virus, not identified symptoms, had led to the identification. “We had already started to work on establishing a relationship with that farmer, talking with them, making sure they’re doing things in a biosecure fashion, and trying to educate them on the information that we knew as we got it,” Martin told the group gathered at the state fairgrounds in Raleigh. Martin also told the crowd that the genetic sequence of the virus found in North Carolina-based cows was the same as the genetic fingerprint of the avian influenza virus in the Texas herd. Veterinary officials believe the Texas outbreak was the result of the cows’ contact with wild birds migrating through the center of the country in late 2023 or early 2024. Martin said the North Carolina case was the first time cattle without symptoms of the disease had been detected in the U.S. outbreak, which now spans 14 states and 197 confirmed cases. In the past month, the disease was detected in Colorado, California, Michigan and Idaho. Thus far, North Carolina has had just the one confirmed case. That’s the way Troxler wants it. And his goal is for North Carolina to have no more cases going forward, despite the large number of cows that get moved around the country. That means frequent testing and providing compensation to farmers who are affected. “It’s a numbers game. The more virus that’s out there, the more likely it is to be mutated and spread to other species,” Troxler said. And while there’s risk to cows — and people — chickens and turkeys could be devastated if the virus got into poultry flocks. Troxler reminded the audience that agriculture, with its $111 billion in annual economic impact, is the state’s largest industry. “And we are particularly vulnerable because of the size of our poultry industry in North Carolina,” he said. “We actually ranked No. 1 in the nation in egg and poultry receipts.” Bird flu in cows? Highly pathogenic avian influenza, H5N1, has been spreading around the world for decades, closely watched by both veterinary and human health officials because of its potential to cause a devastating human pandemic. In the past several years, the disease — which has caused outbreaks in countless commercial poultry flocks throughout the U.S. and the rest of the world — has jumped from birds to other species. The disease has killed mammals on almost every continent in the past few years: red foxes in the Netherlands in 2021, thousands of sea lions and tens of thousands coastal birds in Peru in 2022, and a massive die-off of elephant seal pups in Antarctica and the Atlantic coast of Argentina in 2023. A polar bear died in Alaska last winter. Sea lions on the Pacific coast in Peru and the Atlantic coast in Uruguay have died from the disease, and the list goes on. When “high path” avian influenza outbreak hits a farm — a thought that strikes fear in the hearts of commercial poultry farmers — Troxler said the fatal consequences can be swift. “Maybe overnight, half of the chickens are already dead,” he said. That’s when agricultural officials jump in quickly, typically euthanizing an entire chicken house to keep the disease from spreading further. What’s different about this outbreak in cows is that the disease, which usually affects the respiratory tract (think coughing chickens) is affecting different parts of the animals. In cattle, the virus seems to show an affinity for the cows’ mammary glands, where milk is produced. Symptoms for the cattle include reduced appetite and feeding, and reduced milk production. The milk that is produced comes out thick and yellow. Make more sense of the health care system. Our newsletter can help!

But it’s not benign for all animals that come in contact. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a report of barn cats dying after drinking unpasteurized milk on a farm where the disease had been identified in cows. Eric Deeble, a cattle veterinarian and undersecretary for marketing and regulatory programs at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, was on the panel that Troxler convened last week. He said his agency is compensating farmers for their losses while their animals are sick. The USDA provided a link to information on their website about the farmer compensation program. Credit: USDA The indemnity programs were quickly implemented by the federal agriculture agency to help farmers who can’t sell milk on the market while their cows are sick. Dumping the product could be devastating for their bottom lines. “It’s important, that message, that a farmer — if they detect this in a herd, will not lose their market,” Deeble said. “If there is somebody who suspects that they may have this on their farm, it’s really in their interest to come forward, because there are indemnity programs that can offset the losses that they will experience as this moves through the herd.” Those incentives are there, in part, as an incentive to keep farmers from hiding cases, he added. Managing the spread If farmers hide cases, and health and veterinary officials don’t know about it, then the virus is sure to keep moving, agricultural officials say — in part because it’s not clear how the virus gets from cow to cow. “We’re looking at things like mats, flooring, insects, milking equipment, individual hands, the equipment people are using for pre- and post-milking dips, dip cups, those sorts of things, towels,” Deeble said. “We know that it’s not an aerosolized infection, for which we’re very grateful.” Several dozen cattle workers throughout the country have contracted the disease, which has largely shown up as cases of pink eye. In recent years, more people are seeking out raw, unpasteurized milk. Credit: Rebecca Siegel, Flickr Creative Commons The more cases that get into humans, the bigger the risk that the virus could mutate to become transmissible from person to person as a respiratory disease. That’s what health officials have been watching for in Southeast Asia, where, for instance, several children were infected with a respiratory disease after handling dead chickens last year. In Vietnam and Cambodia, several people have died, but, thus far, the disease has not shown the ability to be passed from person to person, only from animal to person. In the spring, Martin, the state veterinarian, heard from his peers in Idaho that there had been an outbreak in a herd that had received dairy cattle from the Texas herd with the initial outbreak — the same herd that had sold cows to the North Carolina farmer. “The Texas cows probably brought it over, cleared the virus, and now it was just our native cows that had the virus,” he said. “The farmer, much to his credit, gave us the ability to test this herd and work forward under a time when it wasn’t even recommended to test this herd, and we developed a testing protocol,” Martin added. “We basically tested all the positive cows that came from that herd until they stopped testing positive.” But, as Troxler noted, it’s a numbers game. The more cases there are in other species, the more chances there are for the notoriously mutable avian influenza virus to mix and match DNA and start spreading. One easy way to contain potential spread to humans is by pasteurizing milk, all of the panelists said. Headlines this spring proclaimed that evidence of high path avian influenza had been found in parts of the nation’s milk supply, but Troxler was quick to explain that what was found was evidence of the virus’ DNA, not the virus itself. He noted that pasteurization — where milk is heated to high temperatures for a few seconds and then rapidly cooled — completely kills the virus, leaving behind only scraps of its DNA that pose no danger. “Pasteurization takes care of all of it. I know that the first time that we started doing the testing for pasteurization, ‘Does it really kill it or not?’ the public had to know for sure that it killed it,” Troxler said. “There’s no mistake. Pasteurization does take care of this pathogen in the milk and other pathogens.” Republish This StoryRepublish our articles for free, online or in print, under a Creative Commons license.

Debbie James 03 September 2024 https://www.fwi.co.uk More in Health and welfareLivestockLivestock diseasesPoultry Avian influenza insurance now closed to new customers Debbie James 03 September 2024 >More in Health and welfareLivestockLivestock diseasesPoultry © Tim Scrivener One of the UK’s leading providers of avian influenza insurance cover to UK poultry farmers has closed its books to new customers. From 1 September, NFU Mutual says it will not take on new clients for bird flu insurance cover, but insists it made this clear when it opened its avian influenza insurance policy to all new business from 1 April 2024 – the first time it had provided that in over three years. See also: Avian influenza prevention tips and how to handle an outbreak This development could leave farmers vulnerable to significant losses in the event of a disease outbreak this winter, despite a government compensation scheme which pays out on a sliding scale according to bird age. The UK does not currently have outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza in poultry or other captive birds – the last outbreak occurred between October 2021 and March 2024. However, the virus continues to be found in wild birds and there have been cases in poultry and other captive birds in several European countries, most recently on a mixed poultry farm in Brittany, north-west France. Critical period NFU poultry board chairman James Mottershead said the country was now entering a critical period for poultry producers. As the risk of avian influenza ramps up, so does the “vital need” to ensure adequate insurance cover and protection, he added. “The NFU will be looking to support any members impacted by changes within the marketplace,” said Mr Mottershead. “We urge any producers who are affected to contact NFU CallFirst [0370 845 8458] for advice and support.” Unfortunate James Baxter, chairman of the British Free Range Egg Producers’ Association (Bfrepa), whose entire flock of 192,000 layers was culled in 2023 after his birds tested positive for the disease, said it was “unfortunate” that farmers taking out insurance for the first time could no longer insure against avian influenza. “It is a real shame that we find ourselves in this position,’” said Mr Baxter, who farms near Stranraer. “There could also be many farmers with banking facilities where [avian influenza] insurance is expected to be in place who could now be left without cover.” Egg packers Packers Stonegate and Noble Foods provide insurance cover to their suppliers. Stonegate is confident that new applicants to this scheme will not be affected. “Last year, on behalf of its farmers, Stonegate attained a first-of-its-kind avian influenza insurance policy in conjunction with NFU Mutual,” said a spokesperson. “It remains the largest packer-funded scheme in the country and is available to both new and existing Stonegate farmers.” NFU Mutual said that customers who have a policy that renews after 1 September will still be offered renewal terms. Payouts capped However, some egg producers have reported that premiums have become unaffordable and underwriters had capped maximum payouts too. Producers will now find themselves in the position where they need to “self-insure” by putting money aside in the event of an outbreak. In a statement, an NFU Mutual spokesperson said the highest risk from avian influenza is generally from October to March. “By only opening for new business outside of this volatile period, we can ensure that we are able to continue to provide a sustainable, viable insurance product for customers both this year and in years to come.” See more Health and welfareLivestockLivestock diseasesPoultry Share this Most recentSee all Advertisements Explore moreKnow How Visit our Know How centre for practical farming advice Health and welfare Related Most popular this week Explore Latest articles Know How Learning Centre Markets Products and services My Farmers Weekly Newsletters FW Today Magazine online Classifieds Jobs Property Machinery About us Help centre Contact us Advertise with us Subscribe Magazine store finder Join us on Facebook Twitter LinkedIn YouTube Instagram Other services Tax incentives Events Weather Contractor services Value my tractor (beta) Futures course Hedging tool © 2024 MA Agriculture Ltd, a Mark Allen Group company Privacy Policy Cookies Policy Terms and conditionsSwine flu: What is H1N1 infection?

Durg has seen a significant increase in swine flu cases, prompting urgent measures to contain the virus. The situation underscores the importance of understanding the H1N1 influenza virus, recognizing its symptoms, and following preventive measures to protect oneself and the community. What causes H1N1 Infection? Swine flu, caused by the H1N1 influenza virus, is a type of influenza that affects the respiratory system. Originally identified in pigs, this virus can spread to humans, leading to flu-like symptoms. H1N1 is a subtype of the influenza A virus and is known for its rapid transmission and ability to cause widespread illness. Symptoms of Swine Flu The symptoms of swine flu can resemble those of seasonal flu but may also present with some distinct features. Common symptoms include: Fever: Often accompanied by chills and body aches. Persistent Cough: A dry or productive cough that can be severe. Runny or Congested Nose: Nasal symptoms similar to those of a common cold. Gastrointestinal Issues: Diarrhea and vomiting, which are less common in seasonal flu. General Flu Symptoms: Fatigue, muscle aches, and headaches. Protective Measures To reduce the risk of H1N1 infection, follow these steps: Get the flu vaccine, as it helps protect against H1N1. Practice good hygiene by washing your hands often and using hand sanitizer. Cover your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing, and dispose of tissues properly. Avoid close contact with sick people and crowded places if you’re unwell. Stay healthy by eating well, exercising, and sleeping enough. If you have severe flu symptoms, see a doctor right away.

disclaimer News Home News Far south coast of NSW preparing for potential bird flu outbreak in wildlifeMinisterial media releaseAnimals and plantsNative animalsNews and media releasesThe NSW Government is taking action to prepare for a potential wildlife emergency if a dangerous strain of avian influenza reaches Australian shores this spring.H5N1 is a highly contagious strain which is affecting bird species and some mammals overseas. It has seen mass deaths of wild birds and marine mammals as well as animals that prey or scavenge on birds.Australia is the only continent that has not yet detected cases of H5N1 avian influenza. But migratory birds pose a risk of introducing it from the north and from Antarctica.The NSW Government recognises the risk to wildlife, ecosystems, food security, the economy and potentially human health.Several locations on the far south coast of NSW have been identified as high priority sites for risk assessment and response planning. Work is underway at Barunguba – Montague Island Nature Reserve, which is home to bird and seal colonies.The island is considered a potential risk from an H5N1 incursion due to the large number of migratory birds arriving to breed over the coming months. Response strategies will also consider the risk to little penguins and fur seals.If this strain of bird flu arrives in Australia, communities can assist with early detection by reporting what they see. Symptoms of avian influenza usually appear in several or all birds in a flock and include:lack of coordination, arched head, paralysis, seizures, tremorsconjunctivitis, nasal secretions, laboured breathingunusual sudden death.Members of the public and wildlife carers who see dead or symptomatic birds are advised to take the following steps:AVOIDAvoid contact with sick or dead wildlife and their environment.Do not allow pets to touch or eat sick or dead wildlife.RECORDRecord what you see, including the wildlife, location and surrounding area, using video and photographs.REPORTReport any unusual sickness or mass deaths of wild birds (more than five birds) to the Emergency Animal Disease Hotline on 1800 675 888.The NSW Government is taking a range of actions to prepare for the potential arrival of bird flu. They include:The NSW Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water (DCCEEW) is working closely with the NSW Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development (DPIRD) which is the lead agency for an H5N1 outbreak.Setting up an H5N1 taskforce with a specific focus on risks, preparedness and response to outbreaks in wildlife. It is working with other agencies and non-governmental organisations including wildlife carers.Conducting species risk assessments that identify species most at risk, and then assessing priority locations. They include the Little Penguin colony at Manly in Sydney and offshore islands and estuaries where there are important migratory bird or marine mammal colonies.NSW agencies participated in an Australian Government led, all jurisdiction H5N1 preparedness exercise in August. Another exercise is scheduled for September.The recent outbreaks of avian influenza in poultry in Australia have been the H7 strain not the H5N1 strain of current concern.Quote attributable to Minister for the Environment Penny Sharpe:'Australia is yet to be hit by this dangerous strain of bird flu, but NSW is taking action to prepare for its potential arrival.'The NSW Government is working closely with experts across government and across state borders to prepare for risks and respond to any outbreaks.'It is difficult to stop the spread of avian influenza in wild birds, but we are getting the message out now so government agencies, wildlife groups and communities are ready to Avoid, Record, Report.'Quote attributable to Member for Bega Dr Michael Holland:'Our region is home to large wild bird colonies as well as many little penguins and fur seals, and it is important we do all we can to prepare for the potential arrival of this dangerous strain of avian influenza.'The NSW Government is alert to the risk to both poultry farms and wild bird populations, and I thank the community, industry and wildlife groups for their assistance.'photo_cameraOpen description Crested tern (Thalasseus bergii) in flight, returning to the nest Barunguba Montague Island Nature Reserve closeClose descriptionImage Credit: Stuart Cohen/DPE Crested tern (Thalasseus bergii) in flight, returning to the nest Barunguba Montague Island Nature Reserve Contact usMediaEmail: [email protected] Updated September 07, 2024 Regional information Metropolitan Sydney Central Coast Central West and Orana Far West Hunter Illawarra Murray-Murrumbidgee New England-North West North Coast South East and Tablelands Policy and law Legislation Litigation Compliance and enforcement programs Policies Public registers About this website Who we are Our website Privacy and security Copyright and disclaimer Contact us Office Have your say Feedback or complaint We pay respect to the Traditional Custodians and First Peoples of NSW, and acknowledge their continued connection to their country and culture.

Meanwhile, there were 5,006 cases recorded from August 11 to 24, but there may be late reports coming, said DOH.All regions except for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) had an increase in ILI cases over this period. All in all, 102,216 ILI cases were reported in the country from January 1 to August 24. This was 18% lower than the 125,153 cases during the same period last year. ILIs are a group of illnesses that present with common symptoms such as fever, cough, sore throat, colds, body aches, and headaches. The top three causes of ILIs in the Philippines during this reporting period were Influenza A (777, 28.5%); Rhinovirus (770, 28.2%); and Enterovirus (675, 24.7%), according to DOH. The agency said that it is in the process of procuring additional influenza vaccines. It has also cautioned the public against the spread of diseases that may become prevalent during the rainy season. These diseases were called "WILD," which stands for Water and food-borne diseases; Influenza-like illnesses; Leptospirosis; and Dengue. —VAL, GMA Integrated News Tags: Influenza, DOH More Videos Most Popular LOADING CONTENT LOAD MORE ARTICLES RETRY LOADING ◀ All Rights Reserved 2024 © GMA Network Inc.

Funded by Stonegate, the AI Group Insurance initiative is exclusive to Stonegate producers and is designed to protect free range and organic egg farmers by offering six months business interruption should their poultry be infected with AI. While the 180-day cover is free to Stonegate farmers, producers will be able to decide for themselves whether to purchase additional individual cover. Stonegate has introduced a number of initiatives, such as its pullet finance facility, to minimise external pressures on farmers and create a more stable environment to operate in. Adrian Gott, chief executive of Stonegate, said: “We had 100% take up of the policy when we launched the cover last year, which gives an idea of how successful it’s been. We’re in constant communication with our producers about how to create the best possible working environments and reducing risk is a big part of this. I’m delighted to be able to offer our producers the most comprehensive AI cover in the market. It’s another significant step forward in our move to ever close collaboration with our farming partners.” Share.

(HANDOUT/DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY, ENVIRONMENT AND CLIMATE ACTION)Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Julie Collins described the situation as "dynamic" as she highlighted concerns about the impact to wildlife, threatened species and agriculture."While we can't stop the natural migration patterns of wild birds that may be sick, we can prepare ourselves if that does occur by ensuring we are working together in this national effort to protect Australia," she said. Health minister Mark Butler said it was important to remember most strains did not easily spread to humans. "It's important people are aware human infections of avian influenza are rare – and the current risk to the Australian population remains very low," he said."When there are human cases, they typically occur after a person has had close contact with sick birds and livestock or contaminated environments. Poultry workers are most at risk." Members of the public have been urged to minimise any risks by not having any contact with dead or sick wild birds and immediately reporting any deaths to authorities.Australian Associated PressShareFacebookTwitterWhatsappEmailCopyMore from HealthBig police pay rise sparks ructions in other wage deals1hr agoWhy everyday medications could be turning your teeth yellowNo comments'Generational' wage rise to make state's cops top-paidTrial to see if red wine chemical can stop bowel cancerBabies, pregnant mums to have greater RSV protectionCanada detects first presumptive human H5 bird flu caseNewsletters & AlertsView allDAILYYour morning newsToday's top stories curated by our news team.

More than one million birds have been culled as the virus has ravaged eight Victorian farms. Victoria Chief Veterinary Officer Graeme Cooke says, “If this virus were allowed to spread further, it would be devastating for the rest of the poultry industry in Victoria and perhaps onward through Australia.” The avian influenza outbreak has been detected in Victoria, NSW, and the ACT leading to nationwide egg shortages. Amidst this crisis, consumers are turning to alternatives, including Melbourne based, family-owned company Roma Food Products. The owner of the OrgraN brand has seen increase in interest towards its Easy Egg and No Egg Replacer, traditionally favoured by vegans and vegetarians as the go-to egg substitutes for baking and cooking. This shift reflects a broader trend, with these products gaining popularity among a more diverse audience. Roma Food Products founder and Managing Director Max Buontempo considers that supply shortages are the driving forces behind the increased demand for their products as well as the increased costs of groceries including eggs. “With the current crisis affecting egg supplies, combined with the rising cost of living, we’re seeing more households willing to try our OrgraN Egg Replacer and Easy Egg product as a reliable, safe, and cost-effective solution,” Mr Buontempo said. OrgraN attributes much of its success to the convenience and value offered by their No Egg™ product, which serves as a substitute for up to 66 eggs per pack. This product, designed for long-term storage, has a shelf life of 18 months and is free from cholesterol, gluten, dairy, soy, or any animal derivatives, making it a versatile option in today’s competitive market. OrgraN’s success is not only limited to its No Egg product but extends to its Vegan Easy Egg™ as well. “Both products are designed with convenience and long shelf life in mind, making them practical choices for households facing the challenges of the current egg shortages,” the company said. “While No Egg is valued for its versatility in baking and cooking, Vegan Easy Egg offers a more direct substitute for traditional eggs in various dishes, providing customers with multiple options to suit their needs.” It is made primarily from chickpea flour, which is rich in fibre, protein, and micronutrients. It has also earned global recognition, including the prestigious Gold Winner title at the ‘Free From’ Food Awards in London. Since its launch in 1984, OrgraN has expanded to 70 international markets, establishing itself as a leader in allergen-free foods. Their products are available in Australia through Coles, selected independent retailers and exported to distributors worldwide.

The seasonal drive will encourage residents to get vaccinated against influenza. It will also equip medical professionals with the latest international prevention practices, and expand vaccine coverage for target groups. It will be aimed at all segments of the population, including citizens, residents, government and private sector employees, and healthcare workers, with a special focus on those most vulnerable to severe flu complications — elderly individuals, pregnant women, and people with chronic conditions. Stay up to date with the latest news. Follow KT on WhatsApp Channels. The flu season in the UAE typically starts in October. A vaccination drive now help ensure a safe winter. Although flu vaccine may not offer 100 per cent protection, it significantly decreases the severity of the illness if one does get infected. The initiative will be launched in collaboration with the Emirates Health Services (EHS), Abu Dhabi Public Health Centre (ADPHC), Department of Health Abu Dhabi (DoH), Dubai Health Authority (DHA) and Dubai Health. Limit the spread MoHAP’s annual flu campaign is part of a national strategy to immunise the community and safeguard its health. It aims to implement necessary preventive measures to limit the spread of the virus while educating the public about causes, symptoms, and prevention methods of influenza. In July this year, doctors had reported seeing influenza persisting in summer — a phenomenon that they attributed to changing weather patterns, international travel and an influx of tourists. Medical professionals had also stressed on the importance of students getting flu vaccinations before returning to school after the summer break. According to the World Health Organisation, seasonal influenza is an acute respiratory infection caused by influenza viruses. While these viruses are prevalent globally and most people recover without treatment, influenza spreads easily through coughing or sneezing. Vaccination remains the most effective way to prevent the disease and curb its transmission.
