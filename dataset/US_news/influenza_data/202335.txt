The emergence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in wild birds and poultry in North America in late 2021 was the first such outbreak since 2015 and the largest outbreak in North America to date. Despite its prominence and economic impacts, we know relatively little about how HPAI spreads in wild bird populations. In January 2022, we captured 43 mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) in Tennessee, USA, 11 of which were actively infected with HPAI. These were the first confirmed detections of HPAI H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b in the Mississippi Flyway. We compared movement patterns of infected and uninfected birds and found no clear differences; infected birds moved just as much during winter, migrated slightly earlier, and migrated similar distances as uninfected birds. Infected mallards also contacted and shared space with uninfected birds while on their wintering grounds, suggesting ongoing transmission of the virus. We found no differences in body condition or survival rates between infected and uninfected birds. Together, these results show that HPAI H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b infection was unrelated to body condition or movement behavior in mallards infected at this location during winter; if these results are confirmed in other seasons and as HPAI H5N1 continues to evolve, they suggest that these birds could contribute to the maintenance and dispersal of HPAI in North America. Further research on more species across larger geographic areas and multiple seasons would help clarify potential impacts of HPAI on waterfowl and how this emerging disease spreads at continental scales, across species, and potentially between wildlife and domestic animals.

Avian influenza viruses (AIVs) are one such emerging threat to wildlife, domestic animals, and potentially human health. Low pathogenic avian influenza viruses (LPAI) circulate endemically in wild waterfowl populations (ducks, geese, and swans; order Anseriformes) and generally cause little or no clinical disease5. However, since the 2.3.4.4 clade of the A/goose/Guangdong/1/1996 H5N1 lineage of highly pathogenic influenza (HPAI) emerged in 2010, it has caused substantial mortality in many sensitive wild bird populations and significant economic impacts to commercial poultry operations6,7. Outbreaks of HPAI have been concentrated in Eurasia, where these viruses are beginning to be independently maintained in wild birds and cause detrimental effects to many species8,9. In November 2021, the 2.3.4.4 clade was detected in North America for the first time since 201510. It has since spread across the contiguous U.S. and Alaska, across 12 Canadian provinces and territories, and into Central and South America11. Given its pandemic potential in wild birds and poultry9,12, it is crucial to further understand how HPAI impacts wild bird health and how it spreads within and among wild bird populations.Movement behavior of infected hosts drives the spread of infectious diseases and serves as an important indicator of an infection’s pathogenicity. For example, a pathogen that imposes an energetic cost can reduce infected hosts’ movement ability, thus reducing contact rates and limiting transmission. Infection with LPAI is sometimes associated with reduced movement in wild waterfowl at both local and migratory scales13, but just as often LPAI infection has no effect on waterfowl behavior14. However, HPAI viruses likely have stronger negative effects than LPAI viruses on waterfowl movement behavior. For example, a lesser scaup (Aythya affinis) infected with HPAI H5N1 in Maryland, USA in January 2022 exhibited reduced local movements and subsequent mortality (cause unknown); despite these reduced movements, this individual still could have contacted multiple uninfected birds while infected with HPAI H5N115. Conversely, a white-faced whistling duck (Dendrocygna viduata) infected with a highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza (HPAI H5N2) in West Africa displayed similar movement patterns as uninfected conspecifics16. Laboratory studies also show wide variation in responses to HPAI infection across waterfowl species and individuals, including in viral pathogenicity and shedding rates17,18,19,20, which can be modulated by individuals’ previous exposure to HPAI and/or LPAI21,22. Each species’ unique relationship between HPAI infection and movement behavior likely influences its role in the dispersal of HPAI at local, continental, and global scales.Among waterfowl, mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and other dabbling ducks are the best-known reservoir species for AIVs23. Although mortalities have been reported in wild mallards infected with HPAI, including in the 2021–2022 North American outbreak24, most mallards experimentally infected with HPAI H5N1 in laboratory settings show few or no clinical signs despite shedding large quantities of virus25,26,27. Mallards are also the most abundant waterfowl species globally, are distributed across the Northern Hemisphere, and exhibit complex migratory patterns including within-population variation in migration propensity and distance, making them an important species for both dispersal and local maintenance of AIVs28,29. Finally, mallards are relatively adaptable to human activities and often occupy urban and agricultural areas30,31. Their abundance in anthropogenic landscapes makes mallards a potential source of spillover or spillback of AIVs between wild and domestic birds. However, despite their potentially important role for HPAI infection dynamics, we know little about how HPAI infection affects mallard movement behavior, and until now, have had no data on North American mallards’ movement responses to newly emerged HPAI H5N1.In January 2022, we detected HPAI H5N1 in 11 wild mallards in Tennessee, USA. These are the first known detections of HPAI in wild waterfowl in the Mississippi Flyway during the 2021–2022 North American outbreak24. These mallards, which showed no signs of disease at capture, and 32 uninfected conspecifics were fitted with GPS transmitters that provided hourly locations. We used these data to compare local movement behavior and migration patterns between infected and uninfected individuals, and to identify spatio-temporal interactions between marked birds that could have resulted in HPAI transmission. We expected that HPAI H5N1 infection would have pathogenic effects on mallards, which would be reflected in reduced movement by infected mallards shortly after detection of the virus. We expected that this reduced movement would decrease contact rates and shared space use between infected and uninfected birds. We also hypothesized that energetic costs of infection could carry over to spring migration, which would be reflected in later, slower, and/or shorter-distance migration in mallards infected during winter, compared to those with no known history of HPAI infection. Finally, we compared mortality rates and body condition between infected and uninfected birds to understand whether infection with HPAI H5N1 had apparent energetic or fitness costs.ResultsWe captured 11 mallards infected with HPAI H5N1 and 32 that were not shedding any AIV in Tennessee, USA in January 2022. HPAI infection prevalence was 0.39 in females (n = 7/18), 0.16 in males (n = 4/25), 0.32 in juveniles (n = 7/22), and 0.19 in adults (n = 4/21). Prevalence of antibodies to the nucleoprotein of AIV was 0.57 overall (n = 23/40; antibody data were unavailable for three individuals) and 0.54 in HPAI-infected birds (n = 6/11); detection of antibodies could indicate either prior exposure to influenza (HPAI or LPAI) or seroconversion from a recent infection. No clinical signs of illness were observed at the time of capture.Local movementsLocal movement behaviors in the first 19 days following sampling were unrelated to HPAI infection status (Fig. 1, Tables S1–S3); the 19-day period of study was designed to include both active infection and recovery for HPAI-infected birds and ended before any tracked mallards initiated migration. On the first day following sampling, when differences between groups would be expected to be largest, the average area of a HPAI-infected mallard’s daily 100% minimum convex polygon (MCP) was 0.085 km2 (95% CI: 0.036–0.203), which was indistinguishable from that of the average uninfected mallard (mean: 0.148 km2, 95% CI: 0.087–0.250). Regardless of infection status, mallard space use increased following sampling and release, probably indicating temporary effects of capture or transmitter attachment and not infection on movement. We also found no difference in movement behavior by infection status for hourly movement distances or mean net displacement (Fig. 1B, C; Tables S2, S3). In a second set of models, we found no evidence that AIV antibody status (which could indicate either seroconversion from the current infection or from a prior infection) moderated the relationship between HPAI active infection and movement behavior (Table S4).Figure 1Local movement patterns are unrelated to infection with HPAI H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b in 43 mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) sampled in Tennessee, USA during winter 2022. In each plot, points show raw data, lines show estimated means from a linear mixed-effects model, and shaded areas show 95% confidence intervals of the mean. Models also included terms for age, sex, and a temporal autoregressive term for each individual; plots show marginal values averaged across age and sex. For plots that show predictions conditional on random effects, see Fig. S1. (A) Area of a 100% minimum convex polygon (MCP), a measurement of space use. (B) Mean hourly step lengths, a measurement of overall movement. (C) Net displacement, i.e., mean daily distance from the first GPS fix, a measurement of dispersal from the capture site.Full size imageContact ratesWe observed 375 interactions between pairs of mallards (i.e., a mallard was detected within 25 m of a known location of another bird within 65 min; Fig. S2), of which 80 (23%) were potential close or indirect HPAI contacts, i.e., an infected bird followed by an uninfected bird. When we compared this proportion to the expected frequency of contacts in the population, the observed proportion was in the 75th percentile of the randomized data, indicating no significant difference between the observed frequency of contacts and the expected frequency assuming birds were interacting independently of infection status.Infected birds used a cumulative total area of 6.9 km2 during the first four days following sampling; birds were likely to be shedding HPAI for at least four days after sampling, so we considered this area potentially HPAI-contaminated (hereafter “contaminated area”). All birds initially spent most of their time in the contaminated area, but use of this area declined as the winter progressed, at similar rates for infected and uninfected birds (Fig. 2, Table S5). Our model estimated that on the first day of measurement (February 4), tracked mallards spent > 90% of their time in the contaminated area, but this time decreased to < 5% by February 9. There was substantial variation among individuals; two individuals (6%) were never detected in the contaminated area while two others spent all their time in the contaminated area through the end of the study period (individual ID standard deviation = 5.085; AR1 correlation = 0.862). Males spent more time in the contaminated area than females (Table S5).Figure 2Time spent in the potentially HPAI-contaminated area declines prior to initiation of migration. The contaminated area was defined as the total area of all 95% utilization distributions of HPAI-infected mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) in the first four days following sampling. The proportion of time was calculated as the proportion of daily fixes for each mallard within the contaminated area. Points show raw data and are jittered to increase visibility. The line and shaded area show marginal means from a generalized linear mixed-effects model. The model also included terms for HPAI infection status, age, and sex; only sex was related to time spent in the contaminated area (Table S5, Fig. S3).Full size imageMigration patternsWe quantified migration patterns for birds with sufficient telemetry data to measure the beginning of spring migration (n = 35) and arrival at summer sites (n = 29); some birds lacked sufficient data due to mortality, lack of transmitter signal, or transmitter failure. The mean spring migration initiation date was March 15 for infected birds (n = 9) and March 20 for uninfected birds (n = 26). Infected birds departed slightly earlier than uninfected birds (13 days, 95% CI: 27 days earlier to 0.2 days later, R2 = 0.33; Fig. 3, Table S6) and males departed earlier than females (14 days, 95% CI: 1–28 days earlier).Figure 3Relationships between HPAI infection status, sex, and migration patterns in mallards (Anas platyrhynchos). Each panel shows the estimated mean and 95% confidence interval of the mean from a linear model. Partially transparent points show raw data. Models also included a term for age; plots show values for juveniles. (A) HPAI-infected birds departed on spring migration slightly earlier than uninfected birds and males migrated earlier than females. The y-axis shows the day of year of spring migration initiation (day 80 = March 21). (B) The duration of migration was unrelated to infection status. (C) Migration distance was unrelated to infection status, but males migrated farther than females. (D) Migration speed was unrelated to infection status or sex.Full size imageThe time between winter site departure and summer site arrival (i.e., migration duration) averaged 63 days for infected birds (n = 8) and 69 days for uninfected birds (n = 21). Our model indicated no difference in migration duration by infection status or age (Fig. 3, Table S6; R2 = 0.24). There was weak evidence that males migrated for longer than females (estimate: 33 days longer, 95% CI: 3 days shorter to 70 days longer).The average migration distance was 1540 km for infected birds (n = 8) and 1445 km for uninfected birds (n = 21). Our model showed no evidence for a difference in migration distances in infected birds (difference: 228 km, 95% CI: 80 km shorter to 536 km farther, R2 = 0.17; Fig. 3, Table S6). We found no evidence for a difference in migration distance by age or sex.The average migration speed for infected birds was 38 km/day and for uninfected birds was 36 km/day. We found no relationship between infection status and migration speed (estimate: 16 km/day, 95% CI: 24 km/day slower to 57 km/day faster, R2 = 0.14; Fig. 3, Table S6). We also found no evidence for differences in migration speed by age or sex.We found no evidence that AIV antibody status was related to migration date, duration, distance, or speed (Fig. S4, Table S7).Body condition and mortalityWe found no evidence for differences in body condition at capture between infected and uninfected birds (F1,47 = 0.073, p = 0.787) or for differences in survival by infection status, age, or sex. Model-estimated mortality was 0.38 for infected birds (n = 7; 95% CI: 0.01–0.77) and 0.33 for uninfected birds (n = 14; 95% CI: 0.05–0.62).DiscussionWe detected infections with HPAI H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b in 11 of 43 (26%) mallards sampled in Tennessee, USA, during January 2022. These detections represent some of the earliest detections in live birds during the ongoing HPAI outbreak in North America, which has severely impacted wild bird health (e.g., colonially nesting seabirds) and poultry production11. Collectively, our analyses show that HPAI infection in wild mallards during winter had no detectable effects on movement behavior at local (within 19 days) or migratory scales or on body condition or survival. Importantly, we observed shared space use between infected and uninfected birds on the wintering grounds as well as extensive movement of infected birds on the wintering grounds (up to 50 km from the capture site) and during migration. Together, these results suggest that tolerance of HPAI H5N1 infection could promote transmission within this wintering mallard population and beyond, including to other species and geographic areas.Our finding that HPAI-infected and uninfected birds migrated similarly suggests that mallards had the potential to be effective dispersal agents for this emerging virus during its initial introduction to North America in winter 2021–2022. In general, host-parasite combinations where pathogenicity is low or tolerance is high should be associated most strongly with long-distance pathogen dispersal32, especially for migratory species33. Although the expected duration of infection with this clade of HPAI H5N1 can be up to 14 days (in experimentally-exposed immunologically naïve mallards27) and most migrations began more than 14 days after sampling, the shared space use that we observed suggests potential ongoing transmission during winter. Thus, we strongly suspect that many birds could be actively infected at the time of their migration. In addition, all birds either completed their migrations or made a stopover in less than 14 days (Fig. S5), thus providing a potential mechanism for long-distance spread of this pathogen34. However, infection statuses of all marked birds were unknown at the time of migration. It is possible that active and recent HPAI infection affects migration behavior, but that we could not detect these effects because recovery and transmission occurred between the time of sampling and initiation of migration. Nevertheless, our data and analyses show no relationship between infection and movement behavior in the week following sampling, or between infection and body condition, collectively suggesting that HPAI H5N1 infection had minimal negative effects on health or behavior in these wild North American mallards.Laboratory studies show that HPAI infection often has minimal or no effects on duck health or behavior27,35,36, and that in experimental settings, mallards can shed high concentrations of HPAI H5N1 relative to other duck species26. Likewise, we found no differences in body condition or mortality between infected and uninfected birds in this wild population, even though natural settings exhibit higher variability in food availability37,38, body condition39,40, social interactions41, previous AIV exposure, and influenza viral loads in the environment41 than laboratory settings, all of which could influence the dynamics and pathogenicity of influenza infection. Still, infections with the same pathogen can differ in their pathogenicity across individuals and across time, depending on body condition, time since infection, behavior, or infection history39,42,43,44; if the most negatively affected birds are more likely to die or “hunker down,” they would not have been sampled, thus potentially biasing our sample towards individuals that are tolerant of HPAI infection. We also found no evidence that AIV antibodies mediated the effects of HPAI infection on movement behavior. Antibody prevalence is relatively high during winter45, which could have limited our ability to detect subtle changes in behavior of infected mallards; this protective benefit of prior exposure could differ at other times of year or in groups of immunologically naïve birds (e.g., juveniles), which could alter infection-movement relationships. A combination of experimental, observational, and theoretical studies across more species and seasons is necessary to fully understand how immunology and the environment interact to determine the impacts of influenza infection on wild bird behavior and health.Mechanistic models are important tools for understanding the maintenance, dispersal, transmission, and reassortment of influenza viruses46,47, but often face uncertainties in parameter values (e.g., HPAI pathogenicity) or model structures (e.g., HPAI transmission routes). This study can inform several important parameters for these models. First, in North American wintering mallards with some prior AIV exposure, infection with HPAI H5N1 is unrelated to movement distances at local or migratory scales based on our fine-scale location data; therefore, modeling movement as homogeneous across infection statuses could be a reasonable assumption in mechanistic models. Second, mallards in our study contacted one another independent of infection status, but shared space use between birds declined over the course of the winter, probably coincident with increases in movement and changes in habitat selection and availability as the hunting season ended and preparation for migration began48. This pattern suggests that, while contact rates and contact with virions in the environment might be homogeneous within a population, they might vary within seasons. HPAI was also detected concurrently in heterospecific birds at the same refuge (R. Gerhold, unpubl. data), which could further contribute to environmental contamination. Modeling these spatio-temporal patterns in environmental transmission will require more complex functions than assuming that all birds are equally likely to encounter influenza virus in the environment. These results can inform more realistic models that more accurately predict the mechanisms of HPAI transmission and dispersal.The current HPAI H5N1 outbreak in North America has affected over 47 million domestic poultry in the United States and threatens some wild bird species of conservation concern, including seabirds and raptors11,24,49,50. As this outbreak continues, wildlife managers and farmers must adapt their practices to prevent influenza infection in these sensitive species. Our results suggest that mallard populations—which are important culturally as a game species and for wildlife viewing51—might not be substantially impacted by the ongoing outbreak, at least for wintering mallards with prior exposure to AIV infected with the genotype of HPAI circulating in North America in January 2022. However, reduced wetland availability, as has been observed over the last century52, can promote disease transmission within wild waterfowl populations by increasing local densities, contact rates, and probabilities of environmental transmission53. Waterfowl densities at these and other state- and federally-owned waterfowl refuges can be high54,55, meaning that contacts and shared space observed in our study represent only a small fraction of potential direct and environmental transmission among the entire (mostly unmarked) population. As these mallards move locally and northwards on their spring migration, they travel through agricultural areas56 and share stopover sites with other waterfowl species57. We therefore expect that, because of their apparent tolerance to infection and gregarious behavior, wild mallards (and potentially other waterfowl) are important for the epidemiology of HPAI H5N1 in North America. However, because influenza viruses are constantly evolving and some strains exhibit higher pathogenicity than others7,58,59, it is critical to continue to monitor the effects of HPAI H5N1 across larger samples of multiple wildlife species, especially as the virus continues to reassort with North American-origin LPAI. More broadly, these results highlight that interspecific variation in behavior and responses to an emerging infectious disease can impact how these diseases spread, how long they persist, and their potential impacts on wildlife, domestic animal, and human health.MethodsStudy area, capture, and samplingWe captured male and female mallards using rocket nets at Lake Isom National Wildlife Refuge (NWR; 36.3049° N, − 89.4173° W) on 24, 25, 30, and 31 January 2022 (n = 20, 8, 5, and 10 individuals, respectively60. Lake Isom NWR was established in 1938 as Tennessee’s first NWR and maintains a diversity of managed wetlands including croplands, forested wetlands, and a large ~ 150 ha shallow-water lake that is seasonally dried, mechanically manipulated, and flooded during winter to provide moist-soil vegetation and seeds for wintering waterfowl. Lake Isom NWR hosts nearly 40,000 ducks on average in January (January 2022 aerial estimate = 36,83455).We banded all captured mallards with U.S. Geological Survey aluminum tarsal bands and determined sex and age based on cloacal inversion, wing plumage, and bill color61. We aged ducks as juvenile (second year) or after adult (after second year). We measured weight (± 0.10 g) and wing cord length (± 1 mm) for all individuals. We collected oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs of all individuals and placed paired swabs into 2 mL viral transport medium (VTM)62. We also extracted ≤ 3 mL of blood from the brachial artery for each individual and separated the serum fraction. Swabs and sera were stored at − 80 °C until sent for virologic testing and additional analyses at the University of Georgia (Athens, GA, USA).We attached 20-g solar rechargeable and remotely programmable Global Positioning System-Global System for Mobile (GPS-GSM) transmitters (OrniTrack; Ornitela, UAB Švitrigailos, Vilnius, Lithuania) to birds weighing ≥ 1 kg to ensure deployment package remained below recommended body weight limits (3–5%63). We attached transmitters using dorsally-mounted body harnesses made of automotive moisture-wicking elastic ribbon64. Completed harnesses had two body loops knotted and sealed with cyanoacrylic glue above the keel and across the abdomen64. Total package of GPS-GSM transmitter and harness weighed ~ 22 g. Transmitters were remotely programmed to record hourly locations and were not synchronized among individuals. Calibration data on this tag model indicates median location error of < 25 m. We used all available telemetry data from AIV-sampled birds from the first capture (24 January 2022) until we began analysis (27 October 2022)65.All duck capture, handling, and sampling procedures were approved by and carried out in accordance with Tennessee Technological University’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol #19-20-0020) and authorized under Federal Banding Permit #05796. This study complies with the relevant portions of the ARRIVE guidelines for observational studies.Influenza lab methodsWe attempted virus isolation on all swab samples by inoculating a total 1mL of VTM into the allantoic cavities of three 9–11 day-old embryonated chicken eggs66 and incubating at 37 °C for 120 h. Amnioallantoic fluid was collected and tested by hemagglutination assay67. RNA was extracted from amnioallantoic egg fluids for all putative virus isolation-positive samples using the QIAamp viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen Inc.; Germantown, MD, USA) following manufacturer recommendations, and screened for the matrix gene of influenza A virus in real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) as previously described68. Influenza A-positive samples were further screened for 2.3.4.4 HP H5 via rRT-PCR; suspect positives from this assay were sent to the United States Department of Agriculture National Veterinary Services Laboratory, Ames, Iowa for confirmation. A positive virus isolation result indicates active shedding of influenza at the time of capture.Because no birds displayed visible indications of illness, laboratory testing was completed after capture and release, meaning that infection statuses were unknown at time of release.Serum samples were tested for the presence of AIV antibodies by commercial blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (bELISA, IDEXX Laboratories, Westbrook, ME) as described by the manufacturer. An initial serum-to-negative control (S:N) absorbance ratio < 0.5 represents the cutoff threshold recommended by the manufacturer, so we considered samples with an S:N ratio > 0.5 to be positive. A positive bELISA result represents the presence of antibodies to AIV, which indicates prior infection with any AIV (HPAI or LPAI). Influenza antibodies are estimated to be detectable for 6 months–1.5 years69,70,71 but usually peak within 3 weeks of infection69,70.Data analysisLocal movementsWe analyzed daily movement patterns within 19 days of capture to determine whether movement behavior differed between HPAI-infected and uninfected birds, beginning at the time of capture and ending after presumed recovery from infection (≤ 14 days;27). We expected that, if HPAI infection affected local movement behavior, infected and uninfected birds would move differently in the first few days following sampling, but any differences in movement would no longer be observed by the end of the 19-day window. One mallard started migrating 20 days after capture, so we used a 19-day window to include non-migratory movements only.To measure daily movements, we used three related metrics of local movement: the area of a daily 100% minimum convex polygon (MCP), mean hourly step lengths per day, and mean daily net displacement. Daily MCPs draw a convex hull around all daily locations (i.e., GPS fixes); a larger MCP indicates more movement and more exploratory behavior72,73. Mean step length is the average distance between hourly GPS fixes in a day and has been used in prior analyses of influenza in ducks14,15. Finally, mean net displacement measures a bird’s daily average distance from its capture location and measures the timing and distance of initial dispersal. We resampled telemetry data to 1-h intervals with a tolerance of 8 min (i.e., GPS fixes between 52 and 68 min apart), then calculated each movement metric per individual per day. We split days at sunrise because ducks usually move between foraging and roosting areas at dawn and dusk64,73, so using sunrise as the beginning of a day helps ensure that movement or resting at a single foraging or roosting site are included as part of the same day. We identified sunrise times using statistical software (suncalc package version 0.5.0 in R version 4.0.174,75) and calculated MCPs and step lengths (amt package version 0.1.476).For each local movement metric, we fit a linear mixed-effects model with log-transformed area or distance as the response variable (glmmTMB package version 1.1.377,78). Explanatory variables were: active influenza infection status at capture (positive or negative); days since influenza sampling; sex; age; and the pairwise interaction between infection status and days since sampling. This interaction was included to test the prediction that movement would change as birds recovered from infection. We log-transformed days since sampling because we expected that differences in movement between infected and uninfected birds would be largest in the first few days following sampling14,79. We included log-transformed number of GPS fixes as a fixed effect to account for the sensitivity of movement metrics to sample sizes. We also included an AR1 autoregressive random slope for each individual to account for inter-individual variation and temporal autocorrelation in individuals’ locations over time80. We evaluated models using standard plots and tests of residuals (DHARMa package version 0.4.381) and calculated post-hoc estimated marginal means and 95% confidence intervals (CIs, emmeans package version 1.6.382).Antibodies from a prior infection can protect birds from the most severe effects of infection, and the presence of antibodies can indicate that an individual is relatively late in its current infection; in either case, we hypothesized that effects of HPAI infection on movement behavior might be smaller in individuals with antibodies to influenza. Therefore, we repeated these models using a combination of active infection and antibody status as a predictor variable. This variable had three levels: HPAI+/antibody+, HPAI+/antibody–, and HPAI– with either antibody status. These models were otherwise identical to the models using active infection status only.Contact rates and environmental transmissionWe used observed movement patterns of birds within four days of sampling to identify close and indirect contacts that could have led to transmission. Based on experimental infection data, four days is a conservative estimate of the shedding period for HPAI27. We defined a pair of locations as a contact if two birds were observed within 25 m of the same location within 65 min15; this 65-min window accounted for different schedules among GPS transmitters, which were not synchronized to provide fixes at the same time as each other, and allowed five minutes for deviations from this hourly schedule. We considered an interaction to be a contact that could lead to transmission if the bird that was present first was infected and the bird that was present second was uninfected.Next, we examined whether contacts that could have led to transmission were more or less common than would be expected if contacts were random with respect to infection status. To do so, we randomized infection statuses among individuals, then calculated the proportion of contacts that were “possible transmission contacts” in the randomized data. We repeated this process 500 times with replacement, then compared the distribution of proportions in the randomized data to the proportion in the observed data.We also assessed the potential for environmental transmission of HPAI from GPS-tagged mallards by estimating shared space use between infected and uninfected birds; note that this analysis does not account for the presence of untagged HPAI-positive birds at the site and therefore represents a conservative estimate of environmental transmission. For each infected bird, we calculated a dynamic Brownian bridge movement model (dBBMM83; move package version 4.0.684) for the first four days following sampling (as above, a conservative estimate of the HPAI shedding period). We used a location error of 23.5 m and a raster resolution of 30 m for dBBMMs. We then extracted the 95% utilization distribution (UD) contour for each infected bird, which represents the area where the infected individual spent 95% of its time during the four-day period. We then defined the “HPAI-contaminated area” for the population, which included any location covered by at least one infected bird’s 95% UD (i.e., the union of the 95% UDs across all infected birds).Starting at the end of the four-day period for the latest-captured infected bird (February 4, 2022) and continuing until the first date of spring migration (see below; February 11, 2022), we calculated the proportion of time that birds that were uninfected at the time of capture spent inside the HPAI-contaminated area. We started at the end of this period because we had incomplete data on infected birds until the end of this time. For each bird, we calculated the proportion of fixes in the HPAI-contaminated area vs. outside the area for each bird-day. This proportion is a proxy for the daily environmental transmission risk per individual. To understand how this risk varied across individuals, by infection status, over time, and by age or sex, we used a generalized linear mixed-effects model with a logit link to model the proportion of fixes within the contaminated area as a function of days since February 3 (log transformed), HPAI infection status, age, sex, and the interaction between infection status and days since February 3 (using glmmTMB77,78). We also included an AR1 autoregressive term for each bird80, because each bird’s locations on consecutive days are autocorrelated. The model used the number of fixes inside and outside the HPAI-contaminated area as the response variable.Migration patternsTo measure differences in migration phenology and migration patterns between infected and uninfected mallards (Fig. S5), we first segmented each track into wintering, migration, and summer periods. We used bivariate time-series segmentation on latitude and longitude using the segclust2d package85. This method uses the mean and/or variance in these two variables across the track to identify discrete segments. We visually inspected each track to identify the number of segments that most accurately separated wintering and summering phases from migration and stopover. Because segmentation accurately identifies break points in segments but includes movement bouts with either the previous or subsequent segment, we further segmented tracks by creating a new segment each time a bird was observed moving 20 km/h or faster; this speed was a clear distinction between dispersive (flight) and non-dispersive (local) movements for most birds86.We then classified each segment as winter, migration/stopover, or summer. We defined winter as segments with median locations within 50 km of capture. We defined summer locations as segments lasting at least 30 days and beginning in March-July, with a range of net displacement ≤ 50 km87,88. For birds whose transmitters failed before this 30-day period was over, we assigned the last segment as a summer segment if it was at least 1000 km from the capture location and started in March-July. We verified all classifications manually using plots of net displacement over time and maps of the locations of each segment.From these segmented tracks, we measured four characteristic of each individual’s spring migration: (1) the initiation date of spring migration, i.e., the end date of a bird’s last wintering segment; (2) the duration of spring migration, i.e., the time elapsed between the last day of wintering and the first day of summering; (3) migration distance, i.e., the median net displacement of all summer locations (i.e., median distance from capture site); and (4) migration speed, i.e., migration distance divided by migration duration. For six individuals, it was possible to calculate migration initiation date but not the other metrics because they did not have sufficient tracking data for the full migration period. For each migration metric, we modeled differences between infected and uninfected birds using linear models. Each model used the migration metric as the response variable and included infection status, sex, and age as predictors.We also developed a separate set of models that measured relationships between these same variables and prior infection (as opposed to active infection status). These models were constructed identically except that infection was measured using bELISA results as well as virus isolation (i.e., active infection) results. We considered an individual as previously infected at the time of migration if it tested positive for antibodies at the time of capture (i.e., a positive bELISA result) or if it was actively infected at the time of capture.Body condition and mortalityWe examined differences in body condition at capture between infected and uninfected birds. We estimated body condition using the residuals from a linear regression between body mass (g) and wing chord length (cm), which represent deviation from the expectation of size-adjusted mass in the population89. We found no evidence for differences in this relationship by age or sex, so we did not account for age or sex in our calculation of body condition. We tested for differences in body condition between infected and uninfected birds using a linear model with body condition as the response variable and infection status as the predictor variable.Finally, we evaluated whether survival to the end of the study (October 2022) was related to HPAI infection status at capture. We only included birds confirmed to be dead or alive on October 25, 2022 and omitted birds with unknown fates due to transmitter back-log, lack of cellular connectivity, and/or transmitter failure. We fit a generalized linear model with a logit link that measured mortality as a function of infection status, age, and sex.

Current studies focus on regional influenza and the impact of environmental pollutants on time series, and lack of overall studies on the national influenza epidemic and the nonlinear correlation between environmental pollutants and influenza. The unclear spatial and temporal evolution patterns of influenza as well as the unclear correlation effect between environmental pollutants and influenza epidemic have greatly hindered the prevention and treatment of influenza epidemic by relevant departments, resulting in unnecessary economic and human losses.MethodThis study used Chinese influenza incidence data for 2007–2017 released by the China CDC and air pollutant site monitoring data. Seasonal as well as inter monthly differences in influenza incidence across 31 provinces of China have been clarified through time series. Space-Time Cube model (STC) was used to investigate the spatio-temporal evolution of influenza incidence in 315 Chinese cities during 2007–2017. Then, based on the spatial heterogeneity of influenza incidence in China, Generalized additive model (GAM) was used to identify the correlation effect of environmental pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, CO, SO2, NO2, O3) and influenza incidence.ResultThe influenza incidence in China had obvious seasonal changes, with frequent outbreaks in winter and spring. The influenza incidence decreased significantly after March, with only sporadic outbreaks occurring in some areas. In the past 11 years, the influenza epidemic had gradually worsened, and the clustering of influenza had gradually expanded, which had become a serious public health problem. The correlation between environmental pollutants and influenza incidence was nonlinear. Generally, PM2.5, CO and NO2 were positively correlated at high concentrations, while PM10 and SO2 were negatively correlated. O3 was not strongly correlated with the influenza incidence.ConclusionThe study found that the influenza epidemic in China was in a rapidly rising stage, and several regions had a multi-year outbreak trend and the hot spots continue to expand outward. The association between environmental pollutants and influenza incidence was nonlinear and spatially heterogeneous. Relevant departments should improve the monitoring of influenza epidemic, optimize the allocation of resources, reduce environmental pollution, and strengthen vaccination to effectively prevent the aggravation and spread of influenza epidemic in the high incidence season and areas. Peer Review reports BackgroundInfluenza is an acute respiratory infectious disease caused by the influenza virus with obvious seasonal characteristics. The entire world’s population is essentially susceptible to influenza, which can be transmitted by aerosol, droplets, and physical contact. The burden of disease caused by influenza is severe. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), influenza kills about 650,000 people worldwide each year. Since the 20th century, there have been four influenza pandemics, but each has had significant differences with respect to virus subtypes, disease populations, spatial and temporal distribution, and case fatality. Influenza and its complications are a serious public health problem worldwide [1, 2]. China has a higher incidence of influenza than other countries. Owing to the diversity of population, economy, environment, and other factors in different regions of China, the current unclear space-time evolution law of the influenza epidemic and complex pathogenic factors have brought great obstacles to the prevention and control of the influenza epidemic in China. In recent years, infectious respiratory diseases have become more serious. Respiratory diseases such as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which are still doing the rounds, are mixed with influenza. The early symptoms for both are very similar. During the COVID-19 pandemic, an increase in the number of cases of influenza with similar symptoms likely significantly increased the control of respiratory infectious diseases. Research on the spatio-temporal evolution of influenza and environmental risks may significantly reduce the disease and economic burden in China.Previous studies had shown that influenza in China had obvious seasonality, with a significant increase in the number of influenza infections in winter and spring. Studies conducted in different regions of the world have found regional variations in influenza seasonality. In tropical and subtropical regions, there were many peaks in influenza incidence [3]. In the middle latitudes that experience distinct seasons, influenza was more prevalent in winter and varied with latitude [4]. China has a large area and diverse weather patterns, and the influenza incidence in China also showed regional differences. A number of studies have been conducted from the aspect of epidemiological characteristics [5], regional clustering [6, 7], and prediction [8] of influenza. Few studies had combined time series and spatial heterogeneity to further investigate the spatio-temporal evolution pattern of influenza incidence across the country.Environmental epidemiological studies have shown that exposure to environmental pollutants significantly affects the risk of influenza [9, 10]. With the development of spatio-temporal statistical analysis techniques, many mathematical models have been used to study the environmental risk factors of influenza on a macro scale and their effects. Su et al. used wavelet coherence analysis and GAM to explore the short-term and delayed effects of environmental pollutants based on daily influenza incidence and pollutant data in Jinan, China [11]. Liao et al. analyzed the excess risk and lag effect of various environmental pollutants on influenza incidence by using a GeoDetector model and distributed lag nonlinear model [12]. Zhang et al. analyzed the community-level association between PM2.5 and influenza using random forest and spatio-temporal Bayesian model [13]. Most studies focused on the time series of influenza incidence to study the effects of short-term or long-term exposure to environmental pollutants. The exploration of spatial heterogeneity of environmental pollutants and influenza incidence in different regions is still in its early stage. One study showed that the influence of environmental pollutants on influenza had obvious regional differences [14]. At present, GWR and several spatial models are the main research methods for the spatial correlation effect between environmental factors and influenza incidence. GWR was based on linear models without considering the nonlinear effects of influencing factors. The GWR model showed poor adaptability to the multicollinearity of environmental factors with complex interactions. GAM is usually used to study the short-term lag effect of environmental factors on disease. Given the characteristics of its additive model, it can also better explore the nonlinear spatial correlation effect of environmental factors and influenza incidence [15].In this study, an STC model was established based on the time series and spatial heterogeneity of influenza incidence, to explore the spatio-temporal evolution of influenza incidence in China. Combined with GAM, the nonlinear spatial correlation effect between environmental pollutants and influenza incidence was explored. This study will help to better understand the developmental trend of the influenza epidemic in China, clarify the impact of environmental pollutants on influenza, and provide a basis for the prevention and control of the influenza epidemic.Materials and methodsInfluenza incidence dataInfluenza incidence data in China from 2007 to 2017 were obtained from The Data Center of China Public Health Science of Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC http://www.phsciencedata.cn/Share/index.html?ed9df15d-9e67-49c4-9416-1f179d198118). The database contains influenza incidence data from 2007 to 2017 from 315 municipalities in 31 provinces of China. Some data of a small number of municipal regions are missing. Due to difficulties in data acquisition, data of Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan are not included.Environmental pollutants dataThe concentration data of environmental pollutants came from 1,496 national air quality monitoring stations, including the longitude and latitude of the stations as well as the daily concentrations of PM10, PM2.5, SO2, NO2, CO and O3 in 2017. However, some time period data were missing. In this study, Python was used to carry out data cleaning, and some sites with special values and seriously missing data were eliminated, and then sliding average processing method was used to calculate the annual average concentration of six air pollutants from national ambient air quality monitoring stations in 2017. The Kriging method was used to interpolate the site data to cover the entire study area, followed by sectional statistics to match the influenza incidence data. Table 1 shows the summary of environmental pollutants used in this study. Table 1 Summary of environmental pollutantsFull size tableSpace-time cube model (STC)Figure 1 shows the Space-time cube model. The STC was proposed by Hagerstrand in 1970, and further discussed by Rucker and Szego. The STC can show how influenza incidence changes over time in geographic space, and identify the spatio-temporal evolution pattern of influenza incidence through spatio-temporal clustering and hotspot analysis. On the basis of two-dimensional plane space, a one-dimensional time axis was added to the STC, and time steps were used to divide the STC into multiple time slices, and then a three-dimensional cube combining the spatial location and time series was formed. It can represent changes of influenza incidence at a given location over time steps. Fig. 1Space-time cube modelFull size imageBased on the established STC, Getis-Ord Gi* was used to analyze the spatial hot spots of each time slice, and then Mann-Kendall statistical method was used to measure the trend of the bin time series in each location [16], so as to identify the spatio-temporal aggregation pattern. The Mann-Kendall trend test is as follows:For a bin time series with a sample size of n, each cube piece value on the bin time series was calculated and compared with the previous cube piece value, and the value was assigned according to its comparison results.$$diff=\left\{\begin{array}{c}1, {x}_{j}>{x}_{i}\\ 0, {x}_{j}={x}_{i}\\ -1, {x}_{j}<{x}_{i}\end{array}\right.$$Where diff is the assignment, i is a cube piece, j is the next cube piece.The results of each pair of time periods were summed: $$SUM=\sum_{i-1}^{n-1}\sum_{j=i+1}^ndiff$$The expected result of SUM is 0, indicating that there is no trend in influenza incidence at this location over time. Based on the variance of the values in the STC bin time series, the observed SUM was compared with 0 to determine whether the difference was statistically significant. The trend of each bin time series will be recorded as Z-score and p-value. By categorizing Z-scores and p-values, The spatio-temporal evolution pattern of influenza incidence can be classified as New, Consecutive, Sporadic, Oscillating, Intensifying, Persistent, Diminishing, Historical hot or cold spots, as well as one pattern with no significant hot or cold spots characteristics [17]. Table 2 shows the classification definitions of each hot and cold spot pattern. Table 2 Definitions of the Hot/Cold spot patternsFull size tableBased on the established STC, the time series clustering method used the k-means clustering algorithm to classify the spatial units with similar time series in the STC, so as to identify the temporal variation characteristics of influenza incidence in different cities. In this study, the cluster number was set as 5 categories.Generalized additive model (GAM)Poisson regression generalized linear model had been widely used in the study of the harm of environmental pollution to human health, which can quantitatively evaluate the intensity of the correlation effect between environmental pollutants and health. However, the generalized linear model assumes that the observations are independent. Health data on time series are all autocorrelation, so in the 1990s, Hastie and Tibshirani extended the generalized linear model to the generalized additive model. This model was more flexible and can estimate the relative risk, so it had been widely used in recent years to analyze the harm of environmental pollutants to human health. Influenza incidence usually follows Poisson distribution, so Poisson regression was selected as the link function, and GAM was established with the influenza incidence of each city in China as the dependent variable and each environmental pollutant as the independent variable. The model used is shown as follows:$$Log\left[E\right(Y\left)\right]=s({PM}_{2.5}, df)+s({PM}_{10}, df)+s(CO, df)+s({SO}_{2}, df)+s({NO}_{2}, df)+s({O}_{3}, df)+Intercept$$Where E(Y) represents the expected incidence of influenza; s() stands for smoothing function; df is the degree of freedom of the function.The minimum AIC value was used to select the optimal GAM. The establishment of the model, the calculation of relative risk and the plotting were completed by R software 4.1.1 (mgcv, gamRR, nlme package).ResultsTime series of influenza incidence in ChinaFigure 2 shows the time series of influenza incidence by province in China from 2007 to 2017. We normalized the influenza incidence by province. According to the statistics of time series, influenza incidence in most areas of China had obvious seasonal changes, and influenza occurred frequently in winter and spring. The 2009 influenza pandemic lasted from September to January of the following year. In recent years, many cases of influenza started from November to March of the next year, and the incidence was significantly higher than other months in summer and autumn. After March, the influenza incidence decreased significantly, and only sporadic outbreaks occurred in some areas. From a year-on-year perspective, in the past 5 years, the influenza incidence in various regions of China had increased rapidly. In December 2017, China experienced a relatively severe influenza epidemic. Influenza seasonality was not obvious in some areas. For example, Shanghai saw a peak of influenza incidence in July and August, Jiangxi Province showed no significant difference in monthly influenza incidence, and Guangdong Province had a high influenza incidence in June and July. Fig. 2Time series of influenza incidence in 31 provinces of China from 2007 to 2017Full size imageSpatial and temporal patterns of influenza incidence at municipal level in ChinaBased on the fixed locations of 315 cities in 31 provinces of China from 2007 to 2017, the STC of influenza incidence was established, and the blank cube piece was filled based on the spatio-temporal adjacent elements. Finally, 315 bin time series and 11 time slices were obtained. According to the Mann–Kendall trend analysis, the average Z-score was 2.316, and the p-value was 0.008. It can be concluded that the average influenza incidence in China showed an increasing trend over time. We realized the visualization of the STC through the emerging hot spots analysis and time series clustering.Figure 3 shows the spatio-temporal pattern evolution of influenza incidence in China based on STC. The influenza incidence in China from 2007 to 2017 showed an increasing trend in 221 cities, accounting for 70% of the cities in China (Fig. 3a). Only Deyang in Sichuan Province showed a downward trend. The increasing influenza incidence was more obvious in the coastal areas of south China and central China. The influenza incidence fluctuated in most areas of northwest and southwest China, and some areas showed an upward trend. This indicated that the disease burden of the influenza epidemic had gradually increased in the past 11 years, and the concentrated areas of influenza epidemic have gradually expanded, which has become a serious public health problem. We explored the spatio-temporal evolution pattern of national influenza incidence through emerging hot spots analysis.Figure 3b shows that the hot spots for high influenza incidence gradually expanded outward from three persistent hot spots in Guangdong, southern Hebei, southern Shanxi, and southern Anhui. Influenza epidemic hot spot areas had expanded from 21 consecutive hot spots (the nearest two consecutive adjacent time steps are hot spots) to 56 new hot spots (the last time step is a hot spot and has not previously been shown as a hot spot). A number of high-value aggregation regions had formed such as Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, South China, and eastern Central China, with a “+” banded distribution. Cold or hot spot patterns were not identified in other regions.By time series clustering, we divided regions with similar time series influenza incidence into five groups. Figure 3c and d show the spatial distribution and time change curve of the spatial and temporal clustering category of influenza incidence in China. The curve shows that most parts of China experienced a relatively mild influenza epidemic in 2009. Class 1 mainly includes Northeast China, Southwest China, Shandong, Jiangsu, Shanxi, northern Henan, northern Jiangxi, and Fujian, which showed a low level of incidence rate or slight increase after the influenza epidemic in 2009. The regions included in Class 2 are significantly similar to the hot spots in Fig. 3b, mainly including Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, South China, eastern Central China, Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia. These regions showed a slow rise in influenza incidence in recent years. According to Fig. 3c, Class 2 is roughly distributed around high value categories, so the rise of its influenza incidence may be because of the diffusion effect of influenza hot spots. Class 3 represents a small number of regions with a serious influenza epidemic in 2009, which was distributed sporadically. In the following year, the influenza incidence in these regions dropped rapidly, and had not increased significantly in recent years. Class 4 and Class 5 represent the regions where the influenza incidence had increased significantly in different degrees, mainly in Guangdong, parts of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, and southern Anhui. In recent years, the influenza epidemic trend in Guangdong was the most severe. It had risen sharply since 2012, showing a rapidly increasing trend and a clustering effect. The high incidence had spread to surrounding areas. The influenza incidence in central Guangdong, southern Anhui, Beijing, and some regions were significantly different from other regions, showing a strong epidemic trend in recent years. Class 4 and Class 5 were the core of hot spots and may be the source regions of the influenza epidemic. Fig. 3Spatial and temporal patterns of influenza incidence in ChinaFull size imageThe correlation effect between environmental pollutants and influenza incidenceBased on the annual average data of six air pollutants and the influenza incidence data in 315 cities in China in 2017, GAM was used to fit environmental pollutants and influenza incidence. The optimal degree of freedom of each pollutant in the model and the model statistics are shown in Table 3. Table 3 GAM model statisticsFull size tableThe gamRR package was used to determine the relative risk (RR) of the inflection point. Figure 4 shows the non-linear correlation between environmental pollutants and influenza incidence. The curve of the relationship between PM2.5 and influenza incidence generally showed an upward trend. A concentration of 29.44 µg/m3 and RR = 1 indicated that the correlation between PM2.5 and influenza incidence was weakened after reaching this concentration range. When the concentration reached 68.86 µg/m3, RR began to rise rapidly with the increase of PM2.5 concentration, indicating that high concentration of PM2.5 may have a strong influence on the increase of influenza incidence. The correlation of PM10 was roughly negative. RR reached its maximum at the PM10 concentration of 113.56 µg/m3, suggesting that PM10 would have the strongest effect on influenza onset at this concentration. Subsequently, the correlation between the two decreased with the increase of concentration and showed a negative correlation when the concentration was higher. The low concentration of CO showed a weak negative correlation with influenza incidence, and the positive correlation effect gradually became prominent with increasing concentration, and reached the regional peak when the concentration of CO was 1.15 µg/m3. Then, it gradually showed no association. At higher concentrations, the curve of association between CO and influenza incidence increased rapidly. SO2 was roughly negatively associated with influenza incidence. At low concentrations, SO2 likely causes a slight increase in influenza incidence, with a small excess risk. As the concentration of SO2 increased, the association with influenza incidence showed moderate protective effect, with the strongest protective effect at a concentration of 40.33 µg/m3. NO2 was strongly associated with influenza incidence at low concentrations, showing protective effects below 23.9 µg/m3 and the lowest relative risk at 17.98 µg/m3. The positive correlation effect of NO2 became stronger when the concentration exceeded 23.9 µg/m3. The correlation between O3 and influenza incidence is complex. The RR value fluctuates around 1, indicating that the correlation effect of O3 is not strong. It only shows weak protective effect at 88.12 µg/m3 and some small range concentrations. Fig. 4Correlation effect curve between environmental pollutants and influenza incidence in ChinaFull size imageDiscussionWith the increase of the global population, the acceleration of urbanization, the significant increase of population density and mobility, the global influenza epidemic had been increasing year by year. After the severe COVID-19 epidemic had leveled off, the level of influenza virus activity in China appeared to have a significant upward trend in early 2023. After experiencing the relatively serious COVID-19 epidemic, residents had shown significant contempt for the risk of influenza epidemic. In recent years, serious influenza epidemic had almost swept the country, with influenza epidemic occurring more frequently and on an increasingly large scale. Studies had shown that most environmental pollutants can increase the risk of influenza [18]. Clarifying the spatial and temporal evolution pattern of influenza incidence and the correlation effect with environmental pollutants will effectively promote the prevention and control of influenza epidemic and had positive significance for the protection of people’s health.According to the statistics of time series, this study found that influenza incidence in most areas of China had obvious seasonal changes, and influenza occurred frequently in winter and spring. In recent years, many cases of influenza begin from November to March of the next year. Other studies on mainland China also found the same time series results [19, 20]. A study on influenza incidence in the United States based on weekly time series found that the influenza incidence peaked from the 48th week of each year to the 8th week of the following year, and remained relatively stable until the middle of the year. The high incidence period was slightly shorter than that in China, but the seasonality was similar [4]. The spatial and temporal patterns of influenza in similar climate regions around the world also had similar characteristics [21,22,23]. Influenza seasonality may vary in some areas depending on the type of virus circulating, and there may be an unobvious summer peak [24]. Low temperature in winter and spring will increase the pressure of trachea and nasopharynx. Low temperature and dry air may lead to dehydration of the human nasal mucosa and facilitate easy adhesion of bacteria and viruses, thus increasing the risk of respiratory infectious diseases [25]. This study found that the influenza incidence in China was increasing year by year, but there were significant regional differences in the increment pattern. The influenza incidence in different regions had spatiotemporal heterogeneity, which generally showed a high concentration area and a diffusion trend. Regional studies in recent years carried out more detailed identification of high-prevalence areas of influenza and explored the influencing factors for each region [26,27,28]. The results showed that influenza, as a respiratory infectious disease, had a very strong clustering and long-term epidemic situation [29]. Moreover, there were complex differences in the types of epidemic strains, climate characteristics, population mobility, health conditions, and residents’ living habits among regions, which may be the reason for the heterogeneity of influenza incidence on a large scale [30]. These studies on spatial patterns of influenza incidence can quickly identify key areas and epidemic sources and provide effective reference for optimal allocation of resources. In general, the influenza incidence in China not only followed seasonal development but also increased year by year since 2012. Our data revealed a very serious epidemic by 2017. According to reports in recent years, the influenza epidemic in China is still at a high level, despite the relatively strict prevention and control of COVID-19. Relevant authorities need to pay considerable attention to prevent the worsening of the influenza epidemic and take urgent measures (such as timely vaccination) to curb the epidemic situation.Air pollution has always been a universal concern worldwide. The World Health Organization reported that air pollution exposure can cause 7 million premature deaths each year, and some diseases can even lead to severe disability, resulting in a huge burden on families and society. In the past decade, China made remarkable progress in the prevention and control of air pollution. However, even though some polluting enterprises had actively changed to cleaner models, the problems of industrial emissions and vehicle exhaust were still significant and posed a great threat to public health. Studies had shown that the correlation between air pollution and influenza incidence had become a consensus, but there was no clear research result on the influencing mechanism, and its correlation effect was still unclear [31]. Some studies reported the short-term effects of air pollution on the onset of influenza based on time series. They found that air pollution had a lag in the risk of influenza among residents. After experiencing short-term exposure to high concentrations of air pollution, the increase in the risk of illness tended to lag for a week or even longer, but almost no more than a month, and different regions exhibited different lag effects [27, 32]. Most recent studies have focused on the short- and medium-term effects of time, and there is a general lack of studies on the spatial heterogeneity of long-term exposure of environmental pollutants in different regions. Some studies indicated that there were regional differences in the long-term exposure effect of spatial environmental pollutants (one year or longer), and its spatial impact was uneven, which may be related to the inconsistency of many studies [33, 34].Based on GAM, this study explored the nonlinear spatial correlation between environmental pollutants and influenza incidence. It was found that all environmental pollutants and influenza incidence showed a nonlinear correlation, and their relationship curves were not always in the same direction. At low concentrations, PM2.5 was not strongly associated with influenza incidence and may even have a slight protective effect; whereas, its positive correlation developed rapidly at high concentrations. Unlike PM10, PM2.5 can enter the alveoli and be deposited for several years, which may lead to respiratory system damage and make the human body more susceptible to influenza virus infection or aggravation of illness [35, 36]. At high concentrations, PM10 showed negative correlation, and the same characteristics were observed in some other studies [37, 38]. They believed that high concentration of PM10 may reduce UV radiation and thus reduce respiratory system damage. PM10 has a large particle size and cannot easily cross the human barrier, rather it can be easily eliminated by the human body. At high concentrations, it may increase enzyme activity and reduce symptoms. The influencing mechanism of PM10 is not clear at present, and it may also interact with other pollution factors [39]. In general, CO showed a positive correlation, but at low concentration, there may be a negative correlation, which is consistent with some studies on the pathogenesis of CO [40]. Inhalation of CO will cause damage to human respiratory epithelial cells, which is the first barrier against viruses [41]. However, low concentrations of CO may have antibacterial properties, which may be beneficial to build resistance to influenza infection [42]. The correlation of NO2 was similar to that of CO. Although some studies believed that NO2 had no correlation with influenza [43], others reported that NO2 had a positive effect [44]. One study estimated that about 14% of influenza cases could be attributed to excessive NO2 exposure (over 40 µg/m3) [45], which was partly consistent with the results of this study. This study found that the correlation between SO2 and influenza incidence was negative, which was different from other studies. However, some studies also reported this phenomenon. They believe that acidic environments are not conducive to virus survival and may reduce viral transmission [37]. Considerable research has been carried out on the influence of SO2 on the respiratory system, most of which believe that the effect of SO2 should be positive. The results of this study found that O3 may have no correlation with influenza incidence or only have a slightly negative correlation. Some studies believed that it may be related to the bactericidal properties of O3 [18], while others observed a positive correlation [46]. Many research results showed inconsistency. Epidemiological analysis suggests that the correlation between environmental pollutants and infectious diseases may not be able to determine their mutual influence and response. Furthermore, there was a time lag effect between the two, and different regions and different types of environmental factors had great differences in the effect of time. Although we had greatly removed the effects of short-term effects by taking an annual average, environmental pollutants may still cause damage by accumulating in the human body for many years. Environmental pollutants also have seasonality, and the pathogenic mechanism of influenza is complex, which is not only affected by environmental pollutants. At present, there are still large gaps in knowledge regarding environmental toxicology and its harmful effects on the human body.Herein, we studied the influenza incidence in different time and space, determined the areas that need to be focused, and clarified the nonlinear spatial correlation effect between environmental pollutants and influenza incidence. However, our study has some limitations. First, because of the nature of data acquisition, we used the influenza incidence data of 315 cities in 11 years when establishing the STC, and did not carry out research on a smaller time scale. The year-scale data may cause some key areas with obvious seasonal differences in influenza incidence but low overall incidence to be incorrectly identified. Second, we explored the correlation effect of environmental pollutants, without considering the confounding effects of climate, population, and economic factors, and without considering the hysteresis effect. Last, we did not have data on influenza virus subtypes; therefore, the results may not be entirely accurate. In the future, we will aim to use a smaller scale and more detailed influenza data, combined with more detailed environmental-influence mechanism studies to further explore the development trend of influenza and the environmental response mechanism.ConclusionsBased on STC and GAM, this study explored the spatio-temporal evolution patterns of influenza incidence in China during 2007–2017, and identified the correlation effect of environmental pollutants. The study found that the influenza epidemic in China was in a rapidly rising stage, and several regions had a multi-year outbreak trend and the hot spots continue to expand outward. The association between environmental pollutants and influenza incidence was nonlinear and had spatially heterogeneous. Relevant departments should improve the monitoring of influenza epidemic, optimize the allocation of resources, reduce environmental pollution, and strengthen vaccination to effectively prevent the aggravation and spread of influenza epidemic in the high incidence season and areas.

The heavy toll of seasonal influenza has prompted major investments in improving these forecasts, making them a focus of machine learning research. However, little research has been devoted to how well users can understand and use these forecasts to inform decisions under uncertainty. Our approach extends psychological theory to experimental tasks posing hypothetical, but realistic decisions using alternative displays based on actual forecasts. Based on Tversky's theory of conceptual-spatial congruence, we predicted actual and perceived usability of four displays (bar chart, tree map, PDF, and 90% confidence interval). Participants (N = 301, recruited on Amazon MTurk) were randomly assigned to use one of four displays for four decision tasks, created to reflect our extension of the theory. We evaluated participants' comprehension, confidence, and judgments of perceived helpfulness, when the display and the decision were congruent or non-congruent. Participants had better comprehension with the most familiar display (bar chart), for all four decisions. However, they did not perceive that display as more helpful or have greater confidence in their responses to it. Participants who reported greater familiarity with a display performed more poorly, despite expressing greater confidence and rating it as more helpful. We discuss the need to evaluate performance, as well as ratings, and the opportunities to extend theoretical frameworks to specific contexts. 1. Introduction Whereas, numbers and verbal quantifiers are often used for communicating scientific uncertainty (Van Der Bles et al., 2019), visual displays can be a potentially powerful way to convey the complex information needed to inform decisions (Larkin and Simon, 1987; Woloshin et al., 2023). However, that potential is only realized if people can extract and apply the information that they need, and have appropriate confidence in their success. Overconfidence can lead to decisions based on wrong information. Under-confidence can lead to neglecting good information. The COVID-19 pandemic has led experts to produce visual displays for many statistics in many formats. However, few, if any, of those displays have been subject to user testing. We offer a general methodology for such user testing. We demonstrate it with displays used by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for seasonal influenza forecasting. We also test an extension of a prominent theory of display usefulness in this novel context. Seasonal influenza infects 9–35 million Americans annually, with 140,000–810,000 hospitalizations and 12,000–61,000 deaths (CDC, 2020). CDC has invested heavily in improving flu forecasts, hoping to inform both public health decisions (e.g., vaccine manufacture and distribution) and personal health decisions (e.g., taking flu shots and avoiding public areas). Since 2013, CDC has organized a weekly flu forecasting challenge, FluSight, with the twin goals of improving forecasts and developing common data standards. Submitted forecasts provide binned predictive distributions for several influenza events of interest (Reich et al., 2019). However, there is little evidence that the forecasts are being used by the many decision makers who might benefit from them (e.g., health officials, pharmacies, nursing homes, travelers). One possible barrier to wider use is how the forecasts are presented. Currently, flu data are displayed as the suite of confidence intervals submitted by the various teams on CDC's website. While important to CDC and forecasters, those details of epistemic uncertainties and expert disagreements might overwhelm potential users with less technical knowledge or more specific interests. As Pinker proposed, the usefulness of different types of graphs depends on the type of information being extracted (Pinker, 1990). According to Tversky's prominent account of visual information processing, natural correspondence theory (Zacks and Tversky, 1999; Tversky, 2011), a display's usefulness depends on those specific interests. Building on Gestalt principles, the theory posits that displays are more useful when there is a congruent mapping between them and the intended use. Congruency has been found to increase users' ratings of display usefulness and confidence in their decisions. For example, bar charts have been found to be more useful and preferred for discrete comparisons (e.g., males are taller than females), whereas lines are superior for trends (e.g., height increases over time; Tversky et al., 1991, 2000). One general principle of conceptual-spatial congruence theory is that bars, as closed containers, separate things that are inside and outside them, making them useful for communicating categorical information. In contrast, lines suggest connections, hence are useful for communicating continuous information. Thus, for example, Tversky et al. (2012) found that frequency is better represented by a continuous visual variable (e.g., thickness or distance), such that there is a congruence of continuous information and continuous format than by a container (e.g., closed circles); conversely, grouping is better presented by a container than by a continuous display. Tversky et al. found that people preferred and derived greater understanding from congruent mappings, compared to non-congruent ones. We extend the natural correspondence principles to examine how congruence between four displays and four decisions affects people's (a) comprehension, (b) confidence in their decisions, and (c) ratings of display helpfulness. Many studies have examined graph comprehension in terms of inferences drawn from main effects (Shah and Freedman, 2011) or the interpretation of causal and correlational relationships (Fansher et al., 2022). Here, we examine comprehension in terms of understanding uncertainties, as reflected in participants' interpretation, utilization, and evaluation of displays, in the message assembly and interrogation aspects of graph comprehension (Pinker, 1990). We focus on a focal measure in CDC's forecasts, the percentage of patients at medical offices who have influenza-like illnesses, or %ILI. CDC uses this measure, rather than actual influenza cases, because there is too little testing to know which patients' symptoms reflect flu, rather than other causes. Participants in our study made one decision under uncertainty based on each of the four flu-related probabilistic forecasts that FluSight teams make each week: (i) onset week, when the flu season will begin; (ii) peak week, when the flu season will be most intense; (iii) peak week intensity, as measured by %ILI during that week; and (iv) next week flu intensity, in %ILI. Two decisions had categorical options (vaccination campaign and staying home from daycare); two had continuous options (transferring hospital patients and travel plans). We use four displays (Figure 1). Based on our interpretation of natural correspondence theory, two of the displays are categorical (bar charts, tree maps) and two are continuous [probability distribution functions (PDFs), confidence intervals]. In terms of our three dependent variables, when there is natural correspondence, we expect greater comprehension, decision confidence, and perceived helpfulness. FIGURE 1 Figure 1. The four visual displays for “vaccination campaign” decision. (A) bar chart (upper left); (B) tree map (upper right), (C) probability density function (PDF; lower left), and (D) confidence interval (lower right). Hypothesis 1: Comprehension, decision confidence, and perceived helpfulness will be higher when categorical decisions (when to start a vaccination campaign, when to stop sending a child to daycare) are based on categorical displays (bar charts, tree maps) and when continuous decisions (how many patients to transfer, how safe it is to travel) are based on continuous displays (PDFs, confidence intervals)—compared to when there is no such natural congruence. Previous studies have considered bar charts, pie charts, stick figures, and probability density plots, for communicating scientific uncertainty in domains that have included seismic risk, weather forecasts, and health risks (Ibrekk and Morgan, 1987; Lipkus and Hollands, 1999; Bostrom et al., 2008). Most have examined user comprehension and preferences, and occasionally decision making (Fernandes et al., 2018; Padilla et al., 2018; Stephens et al., 2019). Some have investigated individual user features, including familiarity (Friel et al., 2001), subjective numeracy (Fagerlin et al., 2007; Zikmund-Fisher et al., 2007; Peters et al., 2019; Rolison et al., 2020), and subjective visual literacy (Galesic and Garcia-Retamero, 2011; Okan et al., 2012; Garcia-Retamero et al., 2016; Garcia-Retamero and Cokely, 2017). Expecting these results to be replicated, we predict that: Hypothesis 2: Comprehension, decision confidence, and perceived helpfulness will be higher for the displays with which participants are most familiar. Hypothesis 3: Comprehension, decision confidence, and perceived helpfulness will be higher for participants with higher subjective numeracy and subjective visual literacy scores. We also conducted exploratory analyses for how displays relate to decision making, following the findings that visual displays promote risk-avoidant choices, compared to numeric displays (Stone et al., 1997), and that geographical heatmaps promote risk-avoidant behavior, compared to picto-trendlines (Fagerlin et al., 2017). 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Recruitment Adult participants were recruited on Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) in early October 2020. MTurk has been frequently used for evaluating or piloting data visualization aids (Hullman et al., 2015; Okan et al., 2020). Heer and Bostock (2010) found consistent results with MTurk and previous laboratory-based studies of visual displays. An a priori power analysis for OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) with four display groups and four covariates, alpha = 0.05, and power = 0.95, determined a sample size of 236 to reveal a small effect size (0.10). Following Kennedy et al. (2020), we identified 301 responses with valid IP and geolocation addresses out of 370 completed responses for data analyses. Participants took ~25–30 min to complete the survey and were compensated $5.00 for their time. The research complied with the American Psychological Association Code of Ethics and was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Carnegie Mellon University. Informed consent was obtained from each participant. 2.2. Experiment protocol and measures Figure 2 shows the experimental design. Participants were randomly assigned to one of four Forecast Displays: Bar Chart, Tree Map, PDF, or Confidence Interval. They were then asked to use the information in that display to help hypothetical friends make four decisions, presented in random order: “Vaccination Campaign,” “Transferring Hospital Patients,” “Staying Home from Daycare,” and “Travel Plan.” For each decision, participants read background information and completed a task designed to increase their engagement and assess their attention, after which they saw the display and responded to it. After completing the four decision tasks, participants evaluated how familiar they had been with their assigned display before the study, assessed several related risks, and answered questions about themselves. See Supplementary material for the full survey. Figure 1 presents the four displays of one decision. Figure 3 presents the full text of one decision. FIGURE 2 Figure 2. Schematic of the experiment design. FIGURE 3 Figure 3. Text for the “vaccination campaign” decision. 2.2.1. Introduction Participants were first introduced to CDC's FluSight challenge and to the four forecasts events: onset week (when the flu season will begin), peak week (when the flu season will be most intense), peak intensity (%ILI during that week), and short-term intensity (%ILI for next week). They were asked to help CDC find the best way to present these forecasts. 2.2.2. Forecast display Participants were randomly assigned to one of four display types: (a) bar chart, (b) tree map, (c) PDF, and (d) 90% confidence interval. We interpreted two displays as categorical (2a, 2b) and two as continuous (2c, 2d). All four used data from the same hypothetical forecast, based on forecasts displayed on the CMU Delphi website at the time (https://delphi.cmu.edu). 2.2.3. Decision Each task asked participants to extract information from their assigned display to help a hypothetical friend make a decision. Two decisions (vaccination campaign, staying home from daycare) were designed to have congruent mapping with categorical displays and two decisions (transferring hospital patients, travel plans) were designed to have congruent mapping with continuous displays. 2.2.3.1. Vaccination campaign This task involved determining the flu season's onset week, to help the director of a local university's health center decide when to send out vaccination reminders. 2.2.3.2. Transferring hospital patients This task involved determining the peak week for flu intensity, during the next 4 weeks, to help the manager of a large local hospital decide how many patients with mild illnesses to transfer to other places before the peak, to guarantee having enough beds for patients with severe flu symptoms. 2.2.3.3. Staying home from daycare This task involved determining the flu season's peak week, to help parents of a 4-year-old child with a health condition choose the best time to stop sending their child to daycare. 2.2.3.4. Travel plan This task involved determining flu intensity for the following week at a travel destination, to help someone with a weak immune system decide whether to go there. After reading the description of each decision, participants indicated which of a set of factors their friend should consider when making the decision. The list had both relevant options, to engage them (e.g., the cost of canceling the trip), and an obvious decoy option, to serve as an attention check (e.g., the terminal your friend will be arriving at). 2.2.4. Evaluation tasks 2.2.4.1. Comprehension For each decision, participants (a) estimated the value relevant to the decision task from the forecast display (scored as 0 = incorrect, 1 = correct) and (b) identified the range within which that estimated value should fall (scored as 0 = incorrect, 1 = correct). An overall comprehension score summed these two scores for the four decisions (0–8). The comprehension score for categorical decisions summed scores (0–4) for the “Vaccine” and “Daycare” decisions; for continuous decisions (0–4), it summed scores for the “Hospital” and “Travel” decisions. 2.2.4.2. Risk aversion We scored participants' advice to their friend as risk avoidant or risk accepting, either discretely for the categorical decisions or continuously for the others. Thus, (a) Vaccine advice was coded as risk avoidant, if participants thought the campaign should start now (= 1, = 0 otherwise). (b) Travel advice was coded as risk accepting, if they thought their friend should go on the trip next week (= 1, = 0 otherwise). (c) Hospital advice was coded as the number of patients that participants suggested transferring (0, 5, 10… 500), with higher values indicating greater risk avoidance. (d) Daycare advice was coded as the week number that they suggested to start keeping the child at home, with lower values indicating greater risk avoidance. To increase engagement, participants were asked to provide reasons for their advice, which we read, but did not analyze. 2.2.4.3. Confidence We assessed confidence in terms of participants' perception of their ability to perform their assigned tasks. Participants rated their confidence in their advice for each decision, on a scale anchored at 1 = not at all confident and 5 = extremely confident. We took the mean decision confidence for all four decisions (Cronbach's alpha = 0.78), the two categorical decisions (= 0.72), and the two continuous ones (= 0.55), respectively. 2.2.4.4. Perceived helpfulness Participants indicated how helpful they found their assigned display when making each decision, where 1 = not at all helpful to 5 = extremely helpful. We took the mean perceived helpfulness rating for the four decisions (Cronbach's alpha = 0.8), the two categorical (= 0.76), and the two continuous ones (= 0.74). 2.2.5. Personal properties 2.2.5.1. Display familiarity After finishing the four decision tasks, participants rated how familiar their assigned display was before the study, on a scale anchored at 1 = not at all familiar and 5 = extremely familiar. 2.2.5.2. Medical background Participants indicated whether they had any background knowledge or work experience related to medical care or epidemiology, where 1 = yes and 0 = no. 2.2.5.3. Subjective numeracy Participants rated themselves on a four-item subjective numeracy scale (Peters et al., 2019), anchored at 1 = not at all good and 6 = extremely good, for each item. We took the mean rating (Cronbach's alpha = 0.86) as their subjective numeracy score. 2.2.5.4. Subjective visual literacy Participants rated their visual literacy, on a three-item scale developed for this study. It asked participants how well they could use three common displays (graph, map, and manuals; Tversky et al., 2000), for each of four tasks, on a scale anchored at 1 = not at all good and 6 = extremely good. We took the mean of the three items (Cronbach's alpha = 0.72) as their subjective visual literacy score. 2.2.5.5. Demographics Participants answered questions about their age, gender, income, political orientation, education, and health condition at the end of the survey. Participants reported being, on average, 37.7 years old (Median = 34.0, SD = 11.8), with 34.9% being female, 61.1% White or European American, and 64.7% having at least some college education, with 51.8% having a yearly household income above $50,000. On average, participants reported being ideologically moderate (Mean = 3.7, Median = 3.0, SD = 1.9), where 1 = extremely liberal and 7 = extremely conservative; and in relatively good health (Mean = 2.5, Median = 2.0, SD = 1.0), where 1 = Excellent and 5 = Poor. Participants skewed younger, better educated, and with more males, than the general U.S. population (Supplementary Table 3.1). One hundred out of 301 (33.2%) reported having some medical background. 2.2.5.6. Time spent on tasks We recorded how long participants spent on the survey, in minutes. All responses took over 5 min (Mean = 30.6, Median = 24.8). 2.3. Data analysis approach We preregistered our predictions and analyses for Hypotheses 1–3 before conducting any statistical analyses1. To assess the success of our randomization, we conducted separate one-way ANOVAs for subjective numeracy and education, across the four display conditions. As was pre-registered, we assessed participants' completion time and correctness for the attention-check questions and compared the results with and without participants who took two standard deviations less than the mean time to complete the survey or failed all four attention-check questions. To test Hypothesis 1, we first conducted OLS regressions comparing participants' performance (comprehension, decision confidence, and perceived helpfulness) when the decision and display were congruent and when they were not. Next, we compared performance on the two congruent and the two non-congruent displays. Finally, we compared performance on the two categorical and continuous displays. To test Hypotheses 2 and 3, we conducted OLS regressions predicting comprehension, decision confidence, and perceived helpfulness from the three individual-difference measures: familiarity with the display, subjective numeracy, and subjective visual literacy. We also conducted the following exploratory analyses: (a) non-parametric Kendall's tau correlations for participants' performance and time spent on tasks given the non-normal distribution of the completion times and (b) one-way ANOVAs for how many patients to transfer and which week to stop sending the child to daycare, by display groups, and Chi-square tests for proportions of responses for sending a vaccination reminder and continuing the trip. We conducted the preregistered analyses with and without demographic predictors as covariates and found no significant differences. All statistical tests were two-tailed. Exact p-values at < 0.05 level are reported here. However, only those < 0.01 were interpreted as significant, given the multiple tests. 3. Results 3.1. Randomization and attention check One-way ANOVAs revealed no differences across the four forecast displays in terms of participants' subjective numeracy [F(3, 297) = 1.6, p = 0.19] or education [F(3, 297) = 0.81, p = 0.49], indicating successful randomization. All participants spent at least 5 min on the survey, thereby passing that screening test. Twenty indicated that the decoy option was relevant for all four tasks, failing that attention check. As specified in our pre-registration plan, all responses were included in the analyses, regardless of completion time or attention check performance. Repeating the analyses without these responses revealed no differences in any of the patterns reported below (see Supplementary Sections 4–6). 3.2. Dependent measures: performance Table 1 shows correlations between the three dependent measures, and other variables. Participants with greater decision confidence (2) rated the displays as more helpful (3) (τ = 0.60, p < 0.001). Neither variable was, however, correlated with comprehension (1). TABLE 1 Table 1. Correlations (Kendall's tau- τ) of participants' performance and main covariates. Table 2 shows means for each dependent measure for each of the four decisions, for each of the four displays. Two-way ANOVAs (with repeated measures for decision) found a significant between-groups difference for comprehension [F(3, 297) = 5.2, p < 0.01], but not the other dependent measures. The interactions between decision and display group were significant for comprehension [F(9, 891) = 4.5, p < 0.001] and perceived helpfulness [F(9, 891) = 3.3, p < 0.001], but not for decision confidence. The following analyses consider the patterns underlying these overall results. TABLE 2 Table 2. Mean (SD) for participants' performance on the three dependent measures. Figure 4 shows the distributions of responses for the three dependent variables, comparing tasks with and without conceptual-spatial congruence. Supplementary Table 1.1 shows the corresponding OLS analyses. Table 3 shows OLS predictions from the individual difference variables. We report results for each performance measure in turn. Finally, we report risk avoidance for the four recommended decisions with the four displays (Table 4). FIGURE 4 Figure 4. Participants' performance by conceptual-spatial congruence (0 = non-congruent, 1 = congruent). (Left) Comprehension score (ranging from 0 to 4), (Middle) decision confidence (ranging from 1 = not at all to 5 = extremely), and (Right) perceived helpfulness (ranging from 1 = not at all to 5 = extremely). TABLE 3 Table 3. OLS regressions with the dependent measures (overall comprehension, decision confidence, and perceived helpfulness) and independent variables (display familiarity, subjective numeracy, subjective visual literacy, completion time, and demographics). TABLE 4 Table 4. Decisions. 3.2.1. Comprehension Comprehension was unrelated to conceptual-spatial congruence (Figure 4). Thus, we did not observe the hypothesized congruence effect. Looking at cases where the display and decision were congruent, there was no difference between the two categorical displays (bar chart, tree map). PDF was better than CI, the other continuous display, for one measure: comprehension was better with PDF than with CI [p = 0.012; B = −0.44, SE = 0.17, 95% CI = (−0.78, −0.10)] (Supplementary Table 1.2). As predicted in our pre-registered analysis, comprehension was significantly greater with the bar chart than with the other three displays (Table 2, Supplementary Table 4.1). Contrary to Hypothesis 2, OLS regressions (Table 3, Figure 5) found that individuals who reported greater familiarity with their assigned display had lower overall comprehension (also Supplementary Table 4.2). Subjective numeracy and subjective visual literacy were unrelated to overall comprehension (Supplementary Table 4.3). Exploratory analyses found that respondents with higher comprehension scores had less education (τ = −0.21, p < 0.001), were less likely to have a medical background (τ = −0.39, p < 0.001), and spent more time on the survey (τ = 0.18, p < 0.001). FIGURE 5 Figure 5. Display familiarity and participant performance by display group. (Left) Comprehension, (Middle) Decision confidence, and (Right) Perceived helpfulness. Error bars are 95% CIs based on standard errors. 3.2.2. Decision confidence Decision confidence was also unrelated to decision-display congruence (Figure 4, Supplementary Table 1.1), contrary to Hypothesis 2. When display and decision were congruent, there was no difference in participants' confidence in the two categorical displays (bar chart, tree map) or the two continuous ones (PDF, CI; Supplementary Table 1.2). Pre-registered analyses did not find the predicted greater confidence with the bar chart. OLS regressions (Table 3) found that individuals reporting greater familiarity with their display had greater confidence in their decision, as shown in Figure 5 (also Supplementary Table 5.3). Greater confidence was also associated with greater subjective numeracy and subjective visual literacy. All these results are consistent with Hypothesis 2 and 3 (Supplementary Table 5.4). Respondents with higher decision confidence saw themselves as having greater numeracy (τ = 0.34, p < 0.001) and visual literacy (τ = 0.34, p < 0.001). They were also more likely to have a medical background (τ = 0.13, p < 0.01; Mann-Whitney U-test found consistent results). 3.2.3. Perceived helpfulness Perceived helpfulness was also unrelated to decision-display congruence (Figure 4, Supplementary Table 1.1), contrary to Hypothesis 1. When decisions and displays were congruent, the two continuous displays (PDF, CI) were seen as equally helpful; the bar chart was rated as the more helpful of the two categorical displays [p < 0.01; B = −0.43, SE = 0.15, 95% CI = (−0.72, −0.14)] (Supplementary Table 1.2). Pre-registered analysis found, as predicted, that participants rated the bar chart as more helpful than the other three displays (Table 2, Supplementary Table 6.2). OLS regressions (Table 3) found that participants who rated displays as more familiar, also rated them as more helpful, as shown in Figure 5 (also Supplementary Table 6.3), consistent with Hypothesis 2. Higher subjective numeracy and higher subjective visual literacy were both associated with greater perceived helpfulness, consistent with Hypothesis 3 (Supplementary Table 6.4). Respondents who saw their assigned display as more helpful were also more familiar with it (τ = 0.27, p < 0.001), and saw themselves as more numerate (τ = 0.32, p < 0.001) and more visually literate (τ = 0.36, p < 0.001). 3.2.4. Decisions Unlike previous research, there were no significant differences in the decisions, and risk aversion, of individuals using the four displays. Pooling across the display groups, 48.0% of participants would advise sending a vaccination announcement the next week; 32.4% would advise their friend to take the trip. On average, they would advise transferring 38.5 patients and advise their friend to stop sending their child to daycare in week 10.2 (around mid-November). 4. Discussion 4.1. Explanation of results We present a general method for evaluating visual displays communicating scientific uncertainty, using hypothetical decisions that require extracting and employing specific information from a complex display. Our method evaluates users' success (and that of the display), in terms of three performance measures: comprehension, decision confidence, and perceived display helpfulness. We illustrate the method with tasks based on CDC's weekly influenza forecasts. These tasks ask participants to advise hypothetical friends about four decisions under uncertainty, based on the scientific research summarized in one of CDC's four key forecasts, using one of four, randomly assigned visual forecast displays. We found that participants rated the four displays as similarly helpful and had similar confidence in decisions based on them. However, their comprehension scores differed significantly across displays. The interactions between decision and display are significant for all three performance measures, indicating participants' sensitivity to decision-display combinations. Contrary to hypotheses based on previous research, however, that variation was not related to display-decision congruence or to any of our three dependent measures. Thus, participants made decisions similarly with categorical and continuous decisions, whether using categorical displays (bar charts, tree maps) or continuous ones (PDF, CI) and whether the displays and decisions were congruent or not. Our analyses of individual differences also produced surprising results. Comprehension was poorer for some participants for whom one might expect it to be superior: those who reported being more familiar with a display; those with more education, contrary to Brick et al. (2020); and those with medical backgrounds. Participants in each of these groups also completed the task more quickly. 4.2. Implications of results for theory and practice One possible explanation for this predictive failure of congruence theory is that our extension to these displays and decisions was inappropriate. One specific concern is that PDFs and uncertainty bounds (CI) may not fit the theory's construct of continuous visual displays. A second possibility is that familiarity obscured differences predicted by the theory, a possibility raised by Tetewsky (1992). Not only was the bar chart much more familiar than the other displays, but the others were quite unfamiliar. Participants rated a display as more helpful when they rated it as more familiar or rated themselves as having greater numeracy or visual literacy. Their education and familiarity (with a display or with medicine) might lead to unwarranted confidence and reduced carefulness, so that they failed to perform to their ability. Studies of word comprehension have found a similar pattern, with errors more common when participants read familiar, compared to unfamiliar, passages (Malik, 1990). The discrepancies between objective performance and subjective confidence, and the associated display evaluations, may reflect the role of fluency, in the sense of the metacognitive experience of ease associated with information or stimuli processed by people (Schwarz, 2004). Being more familiar with a display (perceptual fluency) or being a healthcare worker more familiar with medical decisions (decision fluency) may have increased confidence, without increasing comprehension (Alter and Oppenheimer, 2009). Consistent with this interpretation, participants who rated themselves higher on numeracy and visual literacy were more confident in their advice and saw the displays as more helpful, but had no greater comprehension. 4.3. Suggestions for future research This study demonstrates a method for testing the usability of visual displays, illustrated with communicating scientific uncertainty in epidemiological forecasts, in terms of comprehension, confidence, and perceived helpfulness as applied to hypothetical decisions that might be informed by each of the four measures reported in CDC's weekly influenza forecasts (Woloshin et al., 2023). We found modest performance differences for the four decisions and associated forecast measures, as well as between the displays. However, those differences did not reflect the predicted effects of congruence between display and decision, such as might support tailoring displays to decisions. Instead, the most familiar display, bar charts, outperformed the three less familiar displays (tree maps, PDFs, and confidence intervals) to a degree that may have wiped out any congruence effects. A recent review of COVID-19 forecasts found that most (29 of 48) uncertainty visualizations used prediction intervals like those in our displays (d) (Zhang et al., 2021). We found evidence suggesting that familiarity, or fluency, with a display can increase confidence in ways that reduce comprehension. Less familiar displays may have the benefit of slowing people down so that they are more careful, in addition to any additional information that they provide. Future research could examine these unexpected effects, along with other predictive frameworks, including alternative interpretations of congruency theory, for communicating uncertainty in decision-relevant terms. 4.4. Study limitations One limitation to these results is that we only have four tasks. In open-ended comments, some participants noted that they found the tasks easier as they moved on, suggesting that additional practice might have improved performance. However, we found little difference in performance between the first and last task, for any display (Supplementary Tables 7.4–7.6). Another limitation is not having the task-specific time stamps needed for finer grained analyses of the relationships between experience, time spent, and the dependent measures. A third limitation is that the study used a relatively well-educated MTurk convenience sample, roughly one-third of whom reported a medical background. Although such individuals are a likely audience for CDC's forecasts, less numerate, visually and medically literate respondents might have revealed greater differences between the displays.

Three years after the world took drastic steps to slow the spread of a different respiratory virus, she found herself living a twisted version of that experience—this time with the nearly 600 iconic birds she oversees as California Condor coordinator at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.California Condors (Gymnogyps californianus) are North America’s largest wild birds—and are among the most endangered. In 1982 there were just 22 of the birds left. Conservationists captured and bred them to painstakingly claw the birds back from the brink of extinction. At the beginning of this year, there were 561 California Condors, more than half of which lived in the wild across several western U.S. states. But this spring, as March turned into April and more birds got sick, the species’ success looked imperiled.“It was [like], ‘We’ve lost five birds today. We lost two more,’ and it just kind of felt like it was snowballing on us,” Blackford says of the losses. Many of these were condors that had roosted in Arizona’s Vermilion Cliffs, the same place where captive-bred birds were first released in 1996. By the end of spring, avian influenza had killed 21 condors out of the flock that soars over Arizona and Utah—and Blackford says the outcome could have been much worse.On supporting science journalismIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing.

Traditionally, wild birds have been known to carry low-pathogenicity avian influenza, which is typically asymptomatic, whereas highly pathogenic avian influenza is usually found in poultry. But in Europe a highly pathogenic strain became epidemic in numerous species of wild birds by 2021, and the strain reached the U.S. the following year. By now that strain has likely killed millions of wild birds, experts estimate.“This is very different from what we’ve seen historically [from avian influenza],” says Samantha Gibbs, lead veterinarian at the FWS Wildlife Health Office. “I don’t think it’s just going to disappear.”And while dead Caspian Terns (Hydroprogne caspia), Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and Red-tailed Hawks (Buteo jamaicensis) are bad news, none of those animals are as rare as the California Condor. “With a really nice, big population that’s healthy, we may lose a number of birds, but we would feel like they could bounce back,” Gibbs says. “We just don’t have that bench strength with the condors.”Condors are particularly vulnerable to avian influenza because of how they live, says Jonathan Hall, a wildlife ecologist at Eastern Michigan University, who specializes in the massive birds. Like humans, “they really interact with each other quite a bit, so that makes this disease much more easily communicable,” he says. “We’re talking about animals that live in extended family groups and kin networks.”Blackford says the flock that suffered from the virus this spring may have inadvertently cultivated it in cool, damp cliff-bound sanctuaries where they raise their chicks. “I think we had some little petri dishes in our nest caves that unfortunately had a greater impact on our population than if they had known to social distance,” she says.Unlike more plentiful species, condors are confronting avian influenza with the cards stacked against them. The mighty birds struggle to maintain their numbers because, like humans, they mature slowly and then reproduce at a low rate; they naturally lay just one egg every year or two. Although conservationists have found ways to increase that rate slightly in a captive breeding program, every bird remains precious.“They’re on this growth trajectory, but it’s slow going, and it’s really expensive, and condors are clearly not at a level where they’re self-sustaining,” says Jacqueline Robinson, an evolutionary geneticist at the University of California, San Francisco, who has studied the birds’ genome. “This loss of so many individuals in such a short time is a pretty big setback for them on that road to once again being a wild, free-ranging, self-sustaining population.”Desperate for anything that could protect the condors, the FWS reached out to the U.S. Department of Agriculture to ask for permission to test an avian influenza vaccine in the birds. “We didn’t know if there would be a vaccine even available,” Gibbs says. “Because no birds have ever been vaccinated against highly pathogenic avian influenza in the U.S., we didn’t think it was a high probability.”After some discussion, the USDA authorized the FWS to use a vaccine developed from a killed virus found in a Gyrfalcon (Falco rusticolus) in the mid-2010s, Gibbs says. But the USDA was reluctant to release a vaccine that could end up being used in poultry because there’s no way to differentiate between such domesticated birds that have been infected with avian influenza and those that have been vaccinated for it. The agency included strict constraints on the condor program to ensure none of the vaccine makes its way to poultry and imperils the $5-billion export market for the latter birds.“There are very tight controls on the way we use and administer the vaccine,” Gibbs says. “It’s akin to using controlled substances, like ketamine.” For example, only a certified veterinarian can administer the vaccine, and each vial must be destroyed within 24 hours after it is opened, she says.Once the condor team had the precious vaccine in hand, the first step was to test it on 20 Black Vultures (Coragyps atratus), which are not endangered, to check for any negative side effects. Now condors are receiving the shot, and 20 birds have been fully vaccinated as of August 25, according to the FWS. Although poultry vaccines are typically administered in two doses, the agency is testing how effective it is to give both the prime shot and the booster in one injection, compared with the usual strategy.How does one vaccinate a 20-pound bird with a nine-foot wingspan and a hooked beak that is often found slicing through an animal carcass? Blackford says experienced condor wranglers are accustomed to using one hand to clamp the beak shut while using the other to hold the bird. A second person does the injecting—down near the bird’s hip, Gibbs says.With the initial doses doled out to the trial condors, the FWS is now monitoring the birds and preparing to measure antibody levels to the virus in their blood beginning next month. “Step one was safety, step two is efficacy, and then step three will be ‘What’s the practicality in the wild flock?’” Blackford says.She says that if all goes well, she and her colleagues hope to plan a rollout strategy by, perhaps, October to protect all the condors before spring migration starts. Then the team will look into giving the birds annual boosters, which Blackford says she hopes can easily fit into the yearly health checks the team already conducts. During these checks, each bird is vaccinated for West Nile virus—a mosquito-borne pathogen that also threatens them—and has blood drawn to check for lead exposure from hunters’ ammunition in mammal carcasses that the massive scavengers eat.Those standard health checks are a testament to the effort people have poured into keeping condors in the sky. And while Blackford says she’s grateful to have a path toward protecting her charges from avian influenza, she would rather it wasn’t necessary.“Our goal is not to always touch every condor every year—it’s to not touch them, to not be able to capture them because they’re so wild and so self-sufficient,” Blackford says. Unfortunately, entering that next phase of recovery will require changing human behavior, not just neutralizing a virus, she says, because hunters’ use of lead bullets remains condors’ biggest threat.“I think it’s a lot easier to combat the avian flu issue because it’s much more straightforward,” Hall says. “The ongoing threats that condors face, really primarily because of the way that the environment has changed over the last 500 years on this continent due to colonization—that’s a much harder issue to address.”A version of this article with the title “Bird Flu Shots” was adapted for inclusion in the November 2023 issue of Scientific American.Rights & PermissionsMeghan Bartels is a science journalist based in New York City.

Common symptoms include headache, sore throat, fever, runny or blocked nose and body aches that last a week or more. Influenza is actually a group of viruses, divided into several sub-groups. Flu A and B are the most common groups that circulate in humans. What are flu antivirals? Influenza antivirals, target specific parts of the viral life cycle, which prevents the virus replicating and spreading. Most flu antivirals target neuraminidase, an important enzyme the virus uses to release itself from cells. On the other hand, COVID antivirals work by inhibiting other parts of the viral life cycle involved in the virus replicating itself. Three influenza antivirals are used in Australia. Relenza (zanamivir) is an inhaled powder and Tamiflu (oseltamivir) is a capsule; both are five-day treatments. Rapivab (peramivir) is a single injection. These antivirals may also come with side effects, such as a headache, vomiting, cough, or fever. Tamiflu and Relenza generally cost A$40-50 in Australia, plus the cost of the consultation fee with your doctor, if applicable. Read more: Should I get a flu vaccine this year? Here's what you need to know How effective are antivirals for the flu? Antivirals have the greatest effect if started 24-72 hours after symptoms. This is to prevent the virus from reaching high levels in the body. Among healthy adults, if Relenza or Tamiflu are started within 48 hours from your first symptoms, they can reduce the duration of symptoms such as cough, blocked nose, sore throat, fatigue, headache, muscle pain and fever by just under a day. For people who have developed severe flu symptoms or who have existing health conditions such as heart disease or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), antivirals that start later (but still before day five of symptoms) can still reduce the severity of infection and reduce the chance of hospitalisation and death. Antivirals need to be started early. Vlada Karpovich/Pexels In a study from the 2009 swine flu (H1N1) pandemic in the United States, treatment with antivirals (Tamiflu and Relenza) reduced the chance of needing to be hospitalised. Around 60% of hospitalisations prevented were among 18-64 years olds, around 20% in children 0-17 years, and 20% in adults aged over 65. The research is less clear about whether antivirals prevent the development of flu complications such as secondary bacterial pneumonia. They might, but so far the data aren’t clear. Are flu antivirals becoming less effective? Antiviral resistance to Tamiflu has been reported around the world, mostly in immunocompromised people, as they have a weakened immune system that allows higher viral loads and prolonged viral shedding. The impact of the antiviral resistance is unclear but there is evidence indicating resistant strains can uphold their ability to replicate effectively and spread. So far it’s not clear if these stains cause more severe disease. However, government agencies and surveillance programs are constantly monitoring the spread of antiviral resistance. Currently there is minimal concern for strains that are resistant to Tamiflu or Relenza. Read more: Why are there so many drugs to kill bacteria, but so few to tackle viruses? Antivirals can also prevent the flu if you’ve been exposed Tamiflu and Relenza can also be used to prevent flu infections, if we’re exposed to the virus or come into contact with infected people. Some studies suggest Tamiflu and Relenza can reduce the chance of developing symptomatic influenza by 70-90%. Many health agencies around the world recommend “prophylactic” treatment for high-risk patients in hospitals or age care setting when people have been in contact with others infected with influenza. Antivirals can stop people who have been exposed to influenza from developing severe illness. Anna Shvets/Pexels So who should talk to their GP about a prescription? Australian guidelines recommend doctors offer antivirals to people with influenza who have severe disease or complications. Doctors can also consider treatment for people at higher risk of developing severe disease from influenza. This includes: adults aged 65 years or older pregnant women people with certain chronic conditions (heart disease, Down syndrome, obesity, chronic respiratory conditions, severe neurological conditions) people with compromised immunity Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people children aged five years or younger residents of long-term residential facilities homeless people. Doctors can prescribe antivirals for the prevention of influenza in vulnerable people who have been exposed to the virus. Antiviral treatment also can be considered for otherwise healthy symptomatic patients who have confirmed or suspected influenza, if they can start treatment within 48 hours of developing symptoms. In some instances a doctors can make a clinical diagnosis of influenza based on the symptoms and known close flu positive contacts of the patient. However, it is preferred to have flu diagnosed by one of the approved diagnostic tests, such as a rapid antigen test (RAT) or the more accurate PCR test, similar to what is perfomed for COVID. There are also now combo tests that can distinguish between SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus. Remember, the flu can cause severe illness or death, particularly among people from the high-risk groups. So if you think you might have the flu, wear a mask and stay away to avoid spreading the virus to others.

Health Issues Which Flu Vaccine Should Children Get? Page Content By: Kristina Bryant, MD, FAAPMany people don't realize how serious influenza (flu) illness can be, even for previously healthy kids and teens. (See "Why Flu Vaccines Top Our Back-to-School List Each Year," below.) Children also play a role in spreading the flu in their homes and communities. Last flu season started earlier than usual. By October 2022, a record number of children under age 4 years were hospitalized with the flu—the most in 10 years. As a parent, the best thing you can do to protect your children and others from the flu is to get them vaccinated. Influenza viruses change yearly. All children age 6 months and older need a flu shot every year. Children should get their influenza vaccine when the shots become available, especially if they need two shots this season. That way they will be protected before flu starts circulating in your community. It takes about two weeks after the shot to build immunity. Which flu vaccines are available?There are two types of influenza vaccines available. The first is what many people call the "flu shot." The second comes as a nasal spray.All the vaccines available for children this year protect against four different influenza viruses (two A and two B viruses). During flu season, multiple different flu viruses may circulate. Sometimes the viruses change during the flu season.Should I get the shot or nasal spray for my child this year?The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) want as many children as possible to get a flu vaccine every year. Both types of flu vaccine (flu shot or nasal spray) can be given according to their indications for this flu season. Any licensed influenza vaccine available this year and appropriate for a child's age and health status can be given, with no preference. Can kids get a flu vaccine and other vaccinations at the same time?Yes. Each year, it is possible that flu, COVID-19, and other common viruses will spread at the same time. Sometimes, the vaccine is not an exact match with the strains in the community. But the vaccine still can protect against serious illness. Talk with your pediatrician about your child getting the flu vaccine along with other recommended immunizations. Flu vaccine can also be given at the same visit as nirsevimab, a long-acting monoclonal antibody indicated for the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. Learn more here. If my child tested positive for COVID, when should they get a flu vaccine?Children with COVID should get a flu vaccine after they have recovered from their COVID illness. Keep in mind that symptoms such as a stuffy and runny nose can make it hard to give the nasal spray vaccine.What about allergies to flu vaccines?A child who had an allergic reaction after a flu vaccine in the past should be seen by an allergist. The allergist can help parents decide if their child should receive their annual flu vaccination. A child with a known history of egg allergy can receive the flu vaccine without any additional precautions beyond those recommended for all vaccines. Why Flu Vaccines Top Our Back-to-School List Each Year By Jennifer Pool Miller Our daughter, Caroline, was very active, physically fit and healthy. She swam several times a week and participated in weekly gymnastics lessons.She had been vaccinated against the flu every year, except one. When she was 5 years old, influenza nearly stole her life. That year, the vaccine wasn't readily available prior to the beginning of school. Once the busy school year began, a flu shot fell off our radar. As winter break approached, Caroline came home from school with the sniffles and a mild cough. She has mild asthma and occasionally uses a nebulizer. But as the evening progressed, Caroline's breathing became more labored than usual. We called her pediatrician, who advised us to alternate doses of her asthma medications and to keep in touch. But by 1 a.m. her condition had worsened. The pediatrician urged us to take Caroline to the hospital, just to be safe. Caroline was diagnosed with influenza A and double pneumonia. Doctors placed her on oxygen and monitored her breathing. She was transferred by ambulance to another hospital with a dedicated pediatric unit, but she slipped into life-threatening acute respiratory distress syndrome and needed to be transported by helicopter to the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.She faced a long and frightening list of complications: flu, pneumonia, severe sepsis, septic shock, hypoxemia and was at risk of cardiorespiratory failure. For the next two weeks, Caroline remained in a medication-induced coma, intubated, and on an oscillating ventilator at the pediatric intensive care unit.Finally, on Christmas Day, Caroline's condition started to take a turn for the better. The recovery process was agonizing, with two steps forward and one step back. And after a long three weeks, she was able to go home. We are fortunate that our daughter was able to fight her way back. Her experience has changed our entire family's lives forever. I now encourage families to consider the flu shot a back-to-school essential. Jennifer Pool Miller serves as treasurer for Families Fighting Flu, a national nonprofit organization dedicated to saving lives and reducing hospitalizations by protecting children and their families against flu through education and advocacy. A strong advocate for annual flu vaccination, joined Families Fighting Flu in 2013 after her daughter Caroline's frightening battle with the flu. Her family established the Caroline Miller Endowed Fund for Nursing Education and "Katie and Caroline P.I.C. YOU!" Award at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia to support continuing education for nurses, in honor of the integral role the CHOP nursing staff played in Caroline's care and recovery. Where should I go for my child's flu shot?Many pediatricians offer flu shot clinics, including curbside and drive-through clinics. The pediatrician's office has your child's health information. That makes it easy to keep track of the flu shot in your child's health record.If they get a flu shot somewhere else, remember to share this information with the pediatrician so the vaccination is included in your child's health record.Don't let the flu stop you and your family!Most people who get the flu are sick for at least a week. But some people get much sicker. Getting vaccinated is the best way to prevent influenza and the serious complications that can result from it—especially for those with high-risk conditions like asthma. For example, flu can lead to pneumonia. Kids with flu also can develop brain inflammation as well as febrile and non-febrile seizures. The flu vaccine keeps people out of the hospital—it stops serious illness and deaths from influenza. Influenza causes thousands of deaths in the United States every year. In the last 10 flu seasons, the number of children who died from flu in a season has ranged from 1 child in 2020-2021 to 199 children in 2019-2020. Before the pandemic, the 2011-2012 season had the lowest number — 37 pediatric deaths from flu. Even children who are otherwise healthy and have no other medical conditions can be hospitalized with flu and develop life-threatening complications.There's no need to wait, even if your child received the previous year's flu vaccine in March or April. Children 6 months to 8 years of age should receive two doses if this is the first time they are being vaccinated against influenza, or if they have only received one dose of flu vaccine ever before July 1. The doses are given four weeks apart. If your child is 8 years old and requires 2 doses of influenza vaccine, they should receive both doses even if they turn 9 years old between dose 1 and dose 2.We have a vaccine for flu, unlike many other respiratory viruses that make kids sick. Let's protect our children from flu when we can.

Three research studies reported at AAIC 2020 suggest: At least one flu vaccination was associated with a 17% reduction in Alzheimer's incidence. More frequent flu vaccination was associated with another 13% reduction in Alzheimer's incidence. Vaccination against pneumonia between ages 65 and 75 reduced Alzheimer's risk by up to 40% depending on individual genes. Individuals with dementia have a higher risk of dying (6-fold) after infections than those without dementia (3-fold). With the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccines are at the forefront of public health discussions. It is important to explore their benefit in not only protecting against viral or bacterial infection but also improving long-term health outcomes." Maria C. Carrillo, Ph.D., Alzheimer's Association chief science officer "It may turn out to be as simple as if you're taking care of your health in this way — getting vaccinated — you're also taking care of yourself in other ways, and these things add up to lower risk of Alzheimer's and other dementias," Carrillo said. "This research, while early, calls for further studies in large, diverse clinical trials to inform whether vaccinations as a public health strategy decrease our risk for developing dementia as we age." Seasonal flu vaccine may reduce incidence of Alzheimer's Dementia Previous research has suggested vaccinations may have a protective factor against cognitive decline, but there have been no large, comprehensive studies focused on the influenza (flu) vaccine and Alzheimer's disease risk, specifically. To address this gap, Albert Amran, a medical student at McGovern Medical School at The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, and team, investigated a large American health record dataset (n=9,066). Amran and team found having one flu vaccination was associated with a lower prevalence of Alzheimer's (odds ratio 0.83, p<0.0001), and among vaccinated patients receiving the flu vaccine more frequently was associated with an even lower prevalence of Alzheimer's (odds ratio 0.87, p=0.0342). Thus, people that consistently got their annual flu shot had a lower risk of Alzheimer's. This translated to an almost 6% reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease for patients between the ages of 75-84 for 16 years. The researchers found the protective association between the flu vaccine and the risk of Alzheimer's was strongest for those who received their first vaccine at a younger age — for example, the people who received their first documented flu shot at age 60 benefitted more than those who received their first flu shot at age 70. "Our study suggests that regular use of a very accessible and relatively cheap intervention — the flu shot — may significantly reduce risk of Alzheimer's dementia," Amran said. "More research is needed to explore the biological mechanism for this effect — why and how it works in the body — which is important as we explore effective preventive therapies for Alzheimer's." Pneumonia vaccine may reduce Alzheimer's risk later in life Repurposing of existing vaccines may be a promising approach to Alzheimer's disease prevention. Svetlana Ukraintseva, Ph.D., Associate Research Professor in the Biodemography of Aging Research Unit (BARU) at Duke University Social Science Research Institute, and team, investigated associations between pneumococcal vaccination, with and without an accompanying seasonal flu shot, and the risk of Alzheimer's disease among 5,146 participants age 65+ from the Cardiovascular Health Study. The team also took into account a known genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's — the rs2075650 G allele in the TOMM40 gene. Related StoriesMachine learning reveals distinct clinical states in pneumonia patientsNIH grant funds study to understand how chemical exposure impacts Alzheimer’s riskExclusive: Emails reveal how health departments struggle to track human cases of bird fluThe researchers found that pneumococcal vaccination between ages 65-75 reduced risk of developing Alzheimer's by 25-30% after adjusting for sex, race, birth cohort, education, smoking, and number of G alleles. The largest reduction in the risk of Alzheimer's (up to 40%) was observed among people vaccinated against pneumonia who were non-carriers of the risk gene. Total number of vaccinations against pneumonia and the flu between ages 65 and 75 was also associated with a lower risk of Alzheimer's; however, the effect was not evident for the flu shot alone. "Vaccinations against pneumonia before age 75 may reduce Alzheimer's risk later in life, depending on individual genotype," Ukraintseva said. "These data suggest that pneumococcal vaccine may be a promising candidate for personalized Alzheimer's prevention, particularly in non-carriers of certain risk genes." Infection substantially increases mortality in people with dementia People living with dementia commonly experience other health conditions including viral, bacterial, and other infections. There is a growing trend in research to investigate whether infections might be worsening, more life-threatening or possibly causing dementia. Janet Janbek, a Ph.D. student at the Danish Dementia Research Centre, Rigshospitalet and the University of Copenhagen in Denmark, and team, used data from national health registries to investigate mortality in Danish residents over age 65 (n=1,496,436) who had visited the hospital with an infection. They found that people with both dementia and such hospital visits died at a 6.5 times higher rate compared with people who had neither. Study participants with either dementia alone or infection-related contacts alone had a threefold increased rate. The rate of mortality was highest within the first 30 days following the hospital visit. The researchers also found that for people living with dementia the mortality rates remained elevated for 10 years after the initial infection-related hospital visit, and mortality rates from all infections (including major infections like sepsis to minor ear infections) were higher compared with people without dementia or without an infection-related hospital visit. "Our study supports the need to investigate these relations even further; to find out why infections are linked to higher mortality in people with dementia, specifically which risk factors and biological mechanisms are involved. This will help advance our understanding of the role of infections in dementia," said Janbek. "Our study suggests that the health care system — as well as relatives of people with dementia — should have increased awareness of people with dementia who get infections, so they get the medical care they need. People with dementia require more specialized treatment even when their hospital visits are not directly due to their dementia but to what might appear to be an unrelated infection," Janbek added.

Therefore, we elucidated the kinetic lipid profiles of mice infected with different doses of influenza virus A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) (PR8) by measuring multiple lipid molecular species using untargeted lipidomic analysis. C57BL/6 male mice were intranasally infected with PR8 virus at 50 or 500 plaque-forming units to cause sublethal or lethal influenza, respectively. Plasma and tissue samples were collected at 1, 3, and 6 days post-infection (dpi), and comprehensive lipidomic analysis was performed using high-performance liquid chromatography–linear trap quadrupole–Orbitrap mass spectrometry, as well as gene expression analyses. The most prominent feature of the lipid profile in lethally infected mice was the elevated plasma concentrations of phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs) containing polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) at 3 dpi. Furthermore, the facilitation of PUFA-containing phospholipid production in the lungs, but not in the liver, was suggested by gene expression and lipidomic analysis of tissue samples. Given the increased plasma or serum levels of PUFA-containing PEs in patients with other viral infections, especially in severe cases, the elevation of these phospholipids in circulation could be a biomarker of infection and the severity of infectious diseases.

In particular, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have received considerable attention for their pro- and anti-inflammatory actions. Among PUFAs, arachidonic acid is one of the most important lipids because it is a precursor of downstream molecules, such as prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and thromboxanes. These eicosanoids significantly regulate inflammatory responses by causing vasocontraction/vasodilation, leukocyte migration, platelet activation, etc1. Arachidonic acid is hydrolyzed from intracellular phospholipids by phospholipases including cytoplasmic phospholipase 2 (cPLA2). Notably, cPLA2 activation by infection with viruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus2, human cytomegalovirus3, respiratory syncytial virus4, and influenza virus5, can induce increased production of free arachidonic acid. Since cPLA2 deficiency prevents pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection6 and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis7 in mouse models, the arachidonic acid cascade may be critically involved in the pathogenesis of various inflammatory diseases. Unlike arachidonic acid, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) have been studied for their anti-inflammatory effects; both DHA and EPA decrease the production of inflammatory cytokines and prostaglandins8 and inhibit the endotoxin-induced inflammatory cascade9.Because free arachidonic acid is further converted into prostaglandins and other molecules that induce various inflammatory responses, stimulation of arachidonic acid production in infectious diseases has been extensively studied, as described above. In addition, early studies have already demonstrated that viral infections can affect lipid composition, such as the ratios of phospholipids and cholesterol esters to total lipids, in the blood and tissues10, 11. Furthermore, our recent study revealed modulation of the signaling pathway of sphingosine-1-phosphate by influenza virus infection12. These findings demonstrate that lipid metabolism is one of the target functions significantly affected by viral infections in the host. However, information on the comprehensive and kinetic profiles of lipid molecules during infection is limited. To better understand host responses to viral infections, we applied an untargeted lipid measurement strategy to an established severe influenza mouse model13. In the analysis, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)–linear trap quadrupole (LTQ)–Orbitrap mass spectrometry (MS), which enables the simultaneous measurement of multiple lipids from different classes in a small amount of plasma samples14, was used. The results demonstrated a unique lipid profile in biological samples from the lethally infected mice.Materials and methodsChemicalsLiquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC–MS) grade methanol, isopropanol, chloroform, and 1 M ammonium acetate solution were obtained from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). The EquiSPLASH Lipidomix quantitative standard (100 µg/mL) and oleic acid-d9 for MS was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL, USA).VirusThe influenza virus A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) (PR8) was kindly provided by the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (Tokyo, Japan). The virus was propagated in 10-day-old embryonated chicken eggs at 35 °C for 48 h, and aliquots of the collected allantoic fluids were stored at − 80 °C until further analysis.MiceMale C57BL/6 mice purchased from Hokudo (Sapporo, Japan) were kept in a BSL-2 laboratory at the International Institute for Zoonosis Control, Hokkaido University, under standard laboratory conditions (room temperature, 22° ± 2 °C; relative humidity, 50 ± 10%) and a 12/12 h light/dark cycle. The mice were administered a standard CE-2 chow diet purchased from CLEA Japan (Sapporo, Japan) with water ad libitum. Experiments were performed on 9–12-week-old male mice.Virus infection and sample collectionVirus infection and sample collection were performed as previously reported13, 15. PR8 virus at 50 or 500 plaque-forming units (PFU) in 50 µL phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or PBS only (control) were intranasally inoculated into mice under inhalation anesthesia with isoflurane. Body weight was monitored daily. At 1, 3, or 6 days post-infection (dpi), the mice were euthanized by an overdose of isoflurane followed by cervical dislocation, and their blood, lungs, and liver were collected. Blood samples were centrifuged at 2000×g for 10 min at room temperature in the presence of heparin sodium (10 U/mL), and supernatants were collected as plasma and stored at − 80 °C until further analysis. Tissues for lipidome analyses were washed in cold PBS to remove excess blood and stored at − 80 °C until sample preparation. Tissue samples for gene expression analyses were homogenized in TRIzol reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and stored at − 80 °C until further analyses. Lung samples for virus titer measurement were homogenized in 1 mL RPMI-anti medium [RPMI-1640 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with 100 U/mL penicillin (Sigma-Aldrich), 100 µg/mL streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich), and 20 µg/mL gentamicin (Thermo Fisher Scientific)]. After centrifugation at 1750×g for 10 min, the supernatants were collected and stored at − 80 °C until further analysis. This study followed the Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments guidelines, with the exception of blinding. Because of the requirement to clearly indicate viral infection and treatment with any reagents on the cage cards, the investigators could not be blinded.Measurement of virus titers in the lungsTo measure lung virus titers, a plaque assay was performed using lung homogenates, as previously reported15.Measurement of the levels of cytokines and chemokines in the plasmaThe plasma levels of interferon-γ (IFN-γ), interleukin-6 (IL-6), IFN-γ-induced protein-10 (IP-10), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), macrophage inflammatory protein-1β (MIP-1β), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were determined using a MAGPIX Milliplex kit (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) following the manufacturer’s instructions, as reported previously15.Measurement of selected gene expressionTotal RNA was extracted from the tissue samples using TRIzol (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), and cDNA synthesis was performed using High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kits (Thermo Fisher Scientific) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Gene expression of ethanolamine kinase 1 (Etnk1; Mm07299373_m1), (Ept1; Mm01210813_m1), phospholipase A2 group IVA (Pla2g4a; Mm00447040_m1), acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4 (Acsl4; Mm00490331_m1), and lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 3 (Lpcat3; Mm00520147_m1) was quantified using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with a StepOne Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) with the indicated TaqMan probes (Applied Biosystems). Gene expression was normalized to 18S (Mm03928990_g1) from the same samples, and relative expression was calculated using the comparative Ct method (ddCt).Lipidome analysesTotal lipids were extracted from the liver, lungs, and plasma using Folch’s method with minor modifications16, 17. Briefly, weighed liver or lung tissue was transferred into a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube and homogenized in 10 volumes of methanol and five to six 1.4 mm ceramic beads (Fisherbrand, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) using a Bead Mill 4 (Fisherbrand) homogenizer (30 s, 2 cycles); for plasma samples, 50 µL of plasma was mixed with 100 µL of methanol. Then, 100 µL of the methanolic homogenate containing 10 mg of each tissue or 150 µL of the plasma–methanol mixture was transferred to a new Eppendorf tube, after which 100 µL of a pre-mixed internal standard solution (10 ng of EquiSPLASH + 100 ng of oleic acid-d9) prepared in methanol was added. The mixture was vortexed at 3500 rpm for 30 s. After adding 400 µL of chloroform, the mixture was vortexed at 3500 rpm for 5 min, and 100 µL of Milli-Q water was added with an additional vortex for approximately 30 s. The biphasic extracts were centrifuged at 20,630×g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the lower chloroform layer was transferred to a new vial. The lipids contained in the upper aqueous layer were re-extracted with 400 µL of chloroform. The organic extracts were combined, and the organic solvent was evaporated under vacuum. The dried total lipids were re-dissolved in 100 µL of methanol with gentle vortexing and centrifuged at 20,630×g for 10 min at 4 °C, after which the supernatant was collected as the LC–MS sample.The untargeted lipidomic analysis was performed using a prominence UFLC system (Shimadzu Corp., Kyoto, Japan) connected to an LTQ Orbitrap MS (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., San Jose, CA) and an Atlantis T3 C18 column (2.1 × 150 mm, 3 µm, Waters, Milford, MA, USA). The flow rate was 200 μL/min with linear flow of the mobile phase, the injection volume via an autosampler was 10 µL, and the column temperature was 40 °C. The mobile phase comprised 10 mM CH3COONH4 (A), isopropanol (B), and methanol (C) in negative mode with a gradient of 30% B and 35% C (0–1 min); 80% B and 10% C (1–14 min); 85% B and 10% C (14–27 min) or in positive mode with a gradient 6% B and 90% C (0–1 min); 83% B and 15% C (1–10 min); 83% B and 15% C (10–19 min); 6% B and 90% C (19–19.5 min); 6% B and 90% C (19.5–22 min). Mass spectrometric data were acquired in negative mode with electron spray ionization (ESI) under the conditions: capillary temperature (330 °C), sheath gas flow (50 units), and auxiliary gas flow (20 units). The source voltage value was set to 3 kV. The Fourier transform full scan range was set to m/z 100–1750 to acquire MS1 spectra for high-resolution masses. Tandem MS (MS/MS) was performed at a collision energy of 40 V in the ion-trap mode to obtain low-resolution MS/MS spectra for identifying lipid molecular species. Raw data were processed using MS-DIAL (version 4.2) software (RIKEN, Wako, Japan) for the alignment, identification, and peak processing of lipid species. The semi-quantification of each lipid molecule was performed with the deuterated internal standard of the same lipid sub-classes or representative lipid class category, following the instructions of Lipidomics Standards Initiative (https://lipidomicstandards.org/) level 2 and level 3. The concentration of the lipid molecular species was calculated by taking the peak intensity ratios of each analyte to those of the internal standard and normalized by the weight or volume of the tissue or plasma, respectively. The concentrations of individual lipid molecules in the plasma, liver, and lungs are provided in Supplementary Tables S1, S2, and S3, respectively.Plasma lipidome data analysisThe concentrations of 297 molecules were determined in the plasma samples, and the characteristics of lipid profiles in each biological sample were analyzed with MetaboAnalyst 5.0 (http://www.metaboanalyst.ca). Features with more than 25% relative standard deviation were removed (data filtering). The remaining 222 values were then log-transformed and normalized by the autoscaling function. Within them, 169 features were found with false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.01 by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Sparse partial least squares discriminant analysis (sPLS-DA) was performed with 20 variables to calculate variable importance in projection scores for components 1 and 2. Utilizing the top 100 features with lowest FDR values, heatmap analysis with data clustering was performed using Euclidean distance measuring and a Ward clustering algorithm.Ethical statementAll mouse experiments were performed with approval (approval# 17-003) from the Animal Care and Use Committee of Hokkaido University following the Fundamental Guidelines for Proper Conduct of Animal Experiment and Related Activities in Academic Research Institutions under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology in Japan. Body weight loss was monitored daily after infection, and mice were humanely euthanized when weight loss reached 25%.Statistical analysesStatistical analyses were performed using Prism 9 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). Differences were identified using two-way ANOVA or mixed-effects analysis with a correction for multiple comparisons, if necessary, and considered significant when p < 0.05. Data are represented as the mean ± SEM.ResultsSublethal and lethal infection with PR8 virus in male C57BL/6 miceOur previous studies defined severe symptoms of mice infected with the PR8 virus infection at 500 PFU, significant weight loss reaching over 25% at 3–6 dpi, and blood coagulation abnormalities such as increased thrombin production and intravascular blood clotting in the lungs13, 15. Therefore, this infection condition was employed to cause lethal disease in mice. In addition, infection at 50 PFU, which does not cause these pathological events, was used as a sublethal disease condition. Based on the observations in the previous studies, the plasma and lungs were collected from mice at 1, 3, and 6 dpi for representing samples at the very early, symptom-onset, and lethal stages during influenza, respectively.Upon intranasal infection with 50 or 500 PFU of PR8 virus, the mice showed significant body weight loss starting at 3 dpi, whereas the control mice showed no weight loss at any time point (Fig. 1a). Plaque assays were conducted to determine the virus titers in the lungs. In mice infected with 50 PFU, the highest virus titer was observed at 6 dpi, whereas in those infected with 500 PFU, the titer peaked at 3 dpi and decreased at 6 dpi (Fig. 1b). At 3 dpi, the virus titers between the mice in the 500 PFU group was significantly higher than those in the 50 PFU group.Figure 1Body weight change, virus titers in the lungs, and plasma concentrations of cytokines/chemokines. Male C57BL/6 mice were intranasally inoculated with PBS control or PBS comprising PR8 virus (50 or 500 PFU), and (a) body weight change was monitored. At 1, 3, and 6 dpi, lung and plasma samples were collected to evaluate (b) virus titers in the lungs and (c–h) cytokine/chemokine concentrations in the plasma. (a) The body weight change of the mice was calculated as a percentage of the original weight. Symbols represent mean ± SEM (n = 5–15 mice; 5 mice in each group were euthanized at 1, 3, and 6 dpi). White, gray, and black symbols indicate data from PBS control, and 50 or 500 PFU of PR8 virus-infected mice, respectively. Mixed-effect analysis using a multiple comparison correction. (b) Virus titers in the lungs were determined by a plaque assay on MDCK cells. Dots represent individual values, and the mean values with SEM are indicated by lines (n = 5). Gray and black symbols indicate data from mice infected with 50 and 500 PFU of the PR8 virus, respectively. (c–h) Concentrations of cytokines and chemokines in the plasma, (c) IFN-γ, (d) IL-6, (e) IP-10, (f) MCP-1, (g) MIP-1β, and (h) TNF-α, were determined by a multiplex ELISA kit. In each panel, dots represent individual values, and bars represent the mean ± SEM (n = 5 mice). White, light gray, and dark gray bars indicate data from PBS control, and 50 or 500 PFU of PR8 virus-infected mice, respectively. Two-way ANOVA using a multiple comparison correction. (a–h) PR8 influenza virus A/Puerto Rico/8/34, PFU plaque-forming unit, dpi day-post-infection, ND not detected.Full size imageProinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, IFN-γ (Fig. 1c), IL-6 (Fig. 1d), IP-10 (Fig. 1e), MCP-1 (Fig. 1f), MIP-1β (Fig. 1g), and TNF-α (Fig. 1h), were measured in the plasma samples collected from PR8 virus-infected mice at 1, 3, and 6 dpi. Among them, IFN-γ, IL-6, and TNF-α were similarly increased at 3 and 6 dpi in both infected groups; however, MCP-1, IP-10, and MIP-1β were higher induced in the lethally infected mice than in those infected with a sublethal dose, especially at 3 dpi. These results indicate that viral infection under both conditions caused systemic inflammation, but it was more severe in lethally infected mice than in the sublethal condition. Under these experimental conditions, comprehensive lipidome analyses were further performed to explore lipid profiles associated with influenza virus infection, particularly in the severe case.Characterization of the plasma lipid profile during severe influenzaUntargeted lipidome analyses were performed on the plasma samples collected at 1, 3, and 6 dpi by the HPLC–LTQ–Orbitrap MS, and 297 lipid molecular species were identified after confirming their MS/MS spectra. The lipid molecular species from major lipid classes included 148 phospholipids [25 phosphatidylcholines (PC), 50 phosphatidylethanolamines (PE), 2 phosphatidic acids (PA), 6 phosphatidylethanols (PEtOH), 1 phosphatidylmethanol (PmeOH), 17 phosphatidylglycerols (PG), 22 phosphatidylinositols (PI), and 15 phosphatidylserines (PS), 8 cardiolipins (CL) and 2 monolysocardiolipins (MLCL)], 45 lysophospholipids [18 lysophosphatidylcholines (LPC), 13 lysophosphatidylethanolamines (LPE), 1 lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), 2 lysophosphatidylglycerols (LPG), 8 lysophosphatidylinositols (LPI), and 3 lysophosphatidylserines (LPS)], 23 free fatty acids (FAs), 45 sphingolipids [24 ceramides (CER), 7 hexosylceramides (HexCER), and 14 sphingomyelins (SM)], 6 cholesteryl esters (CE), 20 triacylglycerols (TG), and 10 diacylglycerols (DG). Elution profiles and plasma concentrations of the annotated lipids are provided in Supplementary Fig. S1 and Supplementary Table S1. The plasma lipid concentrations of each category are shown in Supplementary Fig. S2. Infected mice demonstrated increased PC, PE, and PG at 3 dpi (Supplementary Fig. S2a), increased lysophospholipids at 3 and 6 dpi (Supplementary Fig. S2b), increased FA at 3 dpi and decreased TG and DG at 3 and 6 dpi (Supplementary Fig. S2c). While increased LPC and LPI, and decreased TG and DG were also observed in sublethally infected mice, the elevation of phospholipids at 3 dpi appeared to be specifically associated with lethal infection.Furthermore, sPLS-DA revealed the characteristics of the effect of disease stages and infection conditions, sublethal (50 PFU) and lethal (500 PFU), on the lipid profile in the plasma (Fig. 2a). At 6 dpi, comparable effects of PR8 virus infection under both conditions on plasma lipids were observed, as indicated by similar high values of component 1 scores of the groups in the plots. On the other hand, at 3 dpi, an increase in the component 2 score was observed uniquely in the mice infected under the lethal condition. Top 20 features based on variable importance for prediction (VIP) scores for components 1 and 2 are listed in Fig. 2b and c, respectively, and the individual concentrations of top 5 lipids are shown in Supplementary Fig. S3.Figure 2sPLS-DA of plasma lipidome data. Male C57BL/6 mice were intranasally inoculated with PBS control or PBS comprising PR8 virus (50 or 500 PFU), and lipidome analyses determined the concentrations of 297 molecules in the plasma samples collected at 1, 3, and 6 dpi (n = 5 mice). After data filtering on the basis of relative standard deviation, the remaining 222 values were then log-transformed and normalized by the autoscaling function. The sparse partial least squares discriminant analysis (sPLS-DA) was performed with 20 normalized lipid levels in the plasma as variables to calculate variable importance in projection scores for components 1 and 2. (a) The score plot between component 1 and component 2. Dots represent samples and circles represent the 95% confidence region for each treatment group.

In addition to multivariate analysis, univariate analysis on lipidome data also suggested a unique tendency of the lipid profile of lethally infected mice at 3 dpi (Supplementary Fig. S4). Considering the alteration pattern by infection severity and disease stage, lipid molecules were classified to 3 groups; Group 1, increased at 6 dpi under both infection conditions; Group 2, increased uniquely at 3 dpi by lethal infection and decreased at 6 dpi under both conditions; Group 3, decreased under both infection conditions at 6 dpi. While Group 1 mainly consisted of lysophospholipids, most of the lipids in Group 2 were PEs containing polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA). Group 3 included TG and DG as well as PE, PC, and PI containing monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) containing phospholipids.Figure 3Heatmap analysis of plasma lipidome data. Male C57BL/6 mice were intranasally inoculated with PBS control or PBS comprising PR8 virus (50 or 500 PFU), and lipidome analyses determined the concentrations of 297 molecules in the plasma samples collected at 1, 3, and 6 dpi (n = 5 mice). After data filtering on the basis of relative standard deviation, the remaining 222 values were then log-transformed and normalized by the autoscaling function. Within them, 169 significant features were found; false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.01, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). (a) Utilizing the top 100 lipids with the lowest FDR values, heatmap analysis with data clustering was performed using Euclidean distance measuring and a Ward clustering algorithm. The colored boxes indicate the relative values of the features in each group. The three major clusters are shown in gray, red, and blue.

(a–c) PR8 influenza virus A/Puerto Rico/8/34, PFU plaque-forming unit, dpi day-post-infection.Full size imageThe elevation of PEs containing PUFA in the middle stage of lethal infectionGiven the results of sPLS-DA and heatmap analysis, PE molecules were suggested to change significantly by infection depending on infection dose and disease stage. Moreover, the increasing and decreasing tendency of PE appeared to be associated with the degree of unsaturation of the fatty acid contained. The concentrations of MUFA- and PUFA-containing PE (PE-MUFA and PE-PUFA, respectively) are shown in Fig. 3b. The ratio of PE-PUFA to PE-MUFA significantly increased at 3 and 6 dpi, with a higher increase in lethally infected mice compared to those in the sublethal group at 3 dpi (Fig. 3c).Among PE-PUFA, especially arachidonic acid (20:4), DHA (22:6), and EPA (20:5) showed a marked increase in concentrations upon severe infection at 3 dpi, and this trend was also observed in other phospholipids (Fig. 4). The total concentration of PE, PC, and PI containing arachidonic acid in the plasma increased by 2.20-, 2.41-, and 1.59-fold, respectively (Fig. 4a). In addition to arachidonic acid, the concentrations of phospholipids containing DHA were elevated during severe influenza, by 4.23-fold in PC and 1.69-fold in PE (Fig. 4b); PS, PE, PC, and PI containing EPA increased by 2.23-, 1.95-, 1.80-, and 1.77-fold (Fig. 4c). Therefore, an increase in PE and PC containing PUFA, particularly arachidonic acid and DHA, was considered the most prominent feature of the lipid profile during severe influenza.Figure 4Concentrations of phospholipids containing 20:4, 22:6, or 20:5 in the plasma. Male C57BL/6 mice were intranasally inoculated with PBS control or PBS comprising PR8 virus (50 or 500 PFU), and lipidome analyses were performed with plasma samples collected at 1, 3, and 6 dpi (n = 5 mice). Log-transformed concentrations of phospholipids containing (a) 20:4 (arachidonic acid), (b) 22:6 (DHA), and (c) 20:5 (EPA) in the plasma samples are shown here.

Although not all lipid species showed the same trend, in addition to the plasma, the elevation of PE-20:4 and PE-22:6 and that of PE-22:6 and PC-22:6 were confirmed in the lungs and livers, respectively, of severely infected mice at 3 dpi (Fig. 5). Since PC-PUFA was not detected in the lung samples, PE metabolic pathway was further focused on.Figure 5Concentrations of PEs and PCs containing 20:4, 22:6, or 20:5 in the lungs and the liver. Male C57BL/6 mice were intranasally inoculated with PBS control or PBS comprising 500 plaque-forming unit of PR8 virus, and lipidome analyses were performed with tissue samples collected at 1, 3, and 6 dpi (n = 5 mice). Log-transformed concentrations of phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs) and phosphatidylcholines (PCs) containing 20:4 (arachidonic acid), 22:6 (DHA), or 20:5 (EPA) in (a) the lungs and (b) the liver are shown here.

PR8 influenza virus A/Puerto Rico/8/34, dpi day-post-infection, DHA docosahexaenoic acid, EPA eicosapentaenoic acid.Full size imageAs shown in Fig. 6a, there are two main pathways for PE-PUFA production; de novo synthesis from ethanolamine and remodeling of PUFA hydrolyzed from lipid membrane. Since viral infection causes the alteration of lipid metabolism12, the effect of PR8 virus infection on the gene expression of enzymes related to these pathways was investigated in the lungs and the liver (Fig. 6b). Gene expression levels of Etnk1 and Ept1, rate-limiting enzymes in the reaction of converting ethanolamine to PE, were increased in the lungs at 3 dpi, whereas the liver of infected mice showed the increase and the decrease in those of Etnk1 and Ept1, respectively at 3 dpi. The expression of PC-metabolizing enzymes was also increased at 3 dpi, particularly in the lung (Supplementary Fig. S5).Figure 6Gene expression of PUFA-containing PE metabolizing enzymes.

(b) Male C57BL/6 mice were intranasally inoculated with PBS control or PBS comprising 500 plaque-forming unit of PR8 virus, and relative gene expression levels of Etnk1, Pcyt2, Ept1, phospholipase A2 group IVA (Pla2g4a) encoding cPLA2, Acsl4, and lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 3 (Lpcat3) were measured in lung and liver samples collected at 1, 3, and 6 dpi by real-time PCR. Bars represent the mean ± SEM (n = 4 mice). In each panel, dots represent individual values, and white and gray bars indicate data from PBS control and PR8 virus-infected mice, respectively. Two-way ANOVA using a multiple comparison correction on ddCt values. PR8 influenza virus A/Puerto Rico/8/34, dpi day-post-infection.Full size imageIn the lungs and the liver of mice severely infected with PR8 virus, the gene expression of Pla2g4a, which encodes cPLA2, a well-characterized PLA2, that hydrolyses arachidonic acid from the lipid membrane, was significantly increased, suggesting that arachidonic acid hydrolysis from the lipid membrane is facilitated in these tissues upon virus infection. In addition to Pla2g4a, Acsl4 was significantly increased only in the lungs at 3 dpi, whereas no increase in the expression of Lpcat3, a well-characterized lysophospholipid acyltransferase (LPLAT) contributing to the production of PE-20:4, PE-22:6, and PC-20:419, was observed. Since ACSL4 critically contributes to the acylation of various PUFA including 20:4, 20:5, and 22:6 in the remodeling pathway of free arachidonic acid20, 21, the induction of Acsl4 observed in the lungs may explain the increase in PE-PUFA at least partially.DiscussionIn this study, the kinetic lipid profiles during sublethal and lethal influenza in a mouse model were obtained by untargeted lipidome analyses with the HPLC–LTQ–Orbitrap MS, which determined concentrations of 297 lipid molecular species in each plasma sample. Although infected mice showed clear changes in the concentrations of various types of lipids, not all of which may be due to infection. It should be noted that the mice were not starved in this study, so there could be differences in the effects of feeding conditions on lipid profiles between infected and control mice. For example, it is suspected that the decreased TG and DG levels observed in infected mice may have been due to decreased food intake in the animals. This speculation is based on a previous study that most of the lipids including lysophospholipids, phospholipids, CE, and TG were decreased in serum from Sprague–Dawley rats after fasting for 22 h22. However, in contrast to simple fasting, influenza virus infection resulted in an increase in lysophospholipids (LPC, LPE, LPG, LPS, and LPI) and phospholipids (PC, PE, PG, and PS) in this study (Supplementary Fig. S2). Particularly, our multivariate and univariate analyses on lipidome data in the plasma demonstrated that the most prominent feature of the lipid profile in the plasma of the lethally infected mice was the elevated concentrations of PC- and PE-PUFA at 3 dpi, when the virus titer in the lungs was the highest. Therefore, the increase in these identified phospholipids is considered to have resulted from lethal infection.Gene expression analyses demonstrated a significant increase in Acsl4 as well as PE-biosynthesizing enzymes at 3 dpi in the lungs of infected mice (Fig. 6), which could explain the elevation of PE-20:4 and PE-22:6 in the tissue. A previous study demonstrated higher levels of PE-20:4 and PC-20:4 in the lungs in an influenza ferret model23. Although PC-20:4 was reported to be abundant even in the airway cells of uninfected mouse lungs by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) imaging MS24, it was not detected in our analysis, probably due to differences in lipid detection methods. However, given that ACSL4 is also involved in the PC-20:4 synthesis, and that gene expression of PC-metabolizing enzymes, such as CHK and PCYT1, was significantly increased (Supplementary Fig. S5), PC-20:4 production was thought to be increased in the lungs of infected mice at 3 dpi in the present study. Another possibility is that PC-PUFA abundantly detected in the plasma at 3 dpi was supplied from tissues other than the lung. To address this point, a comprehensive lipidome analysis of plasma and multi-organs from infected mice will be needed. In addition, the critical involvement of ACSL4 in the alteration of phospholipids observed in our study needs to be elucidated in the future, for example by using ACLS4 knockout mice or a specific inhibitor.At 6 dpi, the expression levels of several enzymes involved in the PE and PC synthesis decreased in the lungs (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Fig. S5), suggesting that phospholipid biosynthesis decreases in the later stage of infection. This notion is supported by the significant decrease in total PEs and PCs in the lungs at 6 dpi (Supplementary Fig. S6), and the same tendency was observed in the plasma (Supplementary Fig. S2). In a previous study, the significant decrease of PC (16:0/16:0), PC (16:0/16:1), PC (16:0/18:2), PE (16:0/18:2), PG (16:0/16:0), and PG (16:0/18:1) was demonstrated in alveolar type II (AT2) cells isolated from influenza virus-infected mice at 6 dpi25. All these lipids decreased by 0.47-, 0.39-, 0.69-, 0.76-, 0.33-, and 0.45-fold, respectively, in the lungs of infected mice at 6 dpi also in the present study (Supplementary Table S3). PR8 virus infects and induces cell death in bronchial Clara cells and AT2 cells in mouse lungs26. Given that AT2 cells actively produce surfactant lipids27 and highly express ACSL428, both infection and infection-induced cell death should have affected lipid metabolism in AT2 cells. Furthermore, since PC (16:0/16:0) and PC (16:0/16:1) are major components of lung surfactant29, the significant decrease in the PCs may be associated with the dysregulation of surfactant, which contributes to the host defense against virus infection30.These results suggest that altered gene expression of phospholipid-metabolizing enzymes after infection determined the phospholipid profile in the lungs, which could have affected those in the blood probably through extracellular vesicles secreted from lung cells, such as alveolar epithelial cells, macrophages, and vascular endothelial cells, as reported in lung injury and inflammation31. In addition to increased cytokines, the phospholipids increased in the plasma may also transduce inflammatory signals to tissues distant from the site of infection. Interestingly, the liver of infected mice, which is not an infection target of the PR8 virus32, also showed an increase of PC- and PE-PUFA, particularly PC-22:6 and PE-22:6, at 3 dpi (Fig. 5). Although the exact mechanisms under which respiratory infection induced these changes need to be elucidated in the future, the altered lipid profiles in extrapulmonary organs may be associated with systemic dysfunction in severe influenza.The elevation of PC- and PE-20:4 level may be a counteraction against the increase of free arachidonic acid to reduce the production of its metabolites prostaglandins by incorporating the lipid into phospholipids33. This is called the arachidonic acid remodeling pathway, where ACSL4 plays a pivotal role. Interestingly, the protein expression of ACSL4 has been reported to be induced by the infection with SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus34, 35, which may explain an increase in PE-20:4 and PE-22:6 reported in the plasma of COVID-19 patients36 in addition to that in PE-20:4, PE-22:6, PC-20:4, and PC-22:6 in influenza studies23 in animal models including the present study. Clinical studies on patients with Ebola and zika virus infectious diseases also reported elevated PE-PUFA including PE-20:4 and PE-22:6, but not PC-PUFA37, 38. This difference may be associated with the tropism of viruses that seems to affect the phospholipid metabolism in each tissue differently. There is a possibility that an increase in PE containing PUFA occurs in various infectious diseases, with induction of ACSL4 as a common mechanism. Although further investigations are needed, PE-PUFA levels in circulation and the ratio of PE-PUFA to PE-MUFA (Fig. 3b) could be a biomarker of diverse infectious diseases, particularly respiratory viral infections.Furthermore, PE-20:4 and/or its oxidized products may be involved in the pathogenicity of infectious diseases. PC and PE containing PUFA, particularly arachidonic acid and DHA, are highly susceptible to oxidation, causing ferroptosis, a new class of programmed cell death if lipid peroxide reduction is insufficient20, 39,40,41. Given the increase in malondialdehyde or 4-hydroxynonenal, lipid peroxide metabolites, in patients infected with influenza virus42, hepatitis C virus43, dengue virus44, and SARS-CoV-245, the lipid oxidation–reduction balance is thought to incline toward oxidation by viral infections. Notably, direct evidence of phospholipid peroxides-associated cell death has been recently shown in A549 cells infected with influenza virus46. Therefore, elucidating the biological significance of altered phospholipid metabolism and oxidized derivatives in the hosts will provide insights into pathogenesis of viral infections.This study has several limitations. First, it was difficult to compare concentrations between different lipid molecules because relative, but not absolute, quantification was conducted for each lipid. Second, plasma and tissue samples were prepared in different sets of experiments, so that correlation analysis between lipidome data of plasma and tissues could not be performed. In future studies, these points need to be improved.In summary, we elucidated the plasma lipid profile of mice in sublethal and lethal influenza by untargeted lipidome analyses using HPLC–LTQ–Orbitrap MS. Of note, the increase in plasma concentrations of PE-PUFA was observed only in the middle stage of severe influenza but not in mice with mild disease, when gene expression analyses and lipid profiles in the lungs suggested that the production of PE-PUFA was increased in the lungs. In the future, we will further investigate the biological significance of the alteration in phospholipid metabolism associated with severe influenza in regulating host immune responses, especially immune cell recruitment and infected cell clearance. In addition, the sharp decrease in CE at the early stage of infection in the lungs (Supplementary Fig. S6) is also an attractive research target. These investigations will provide novel insight into the pathogenicity and therapeutic strategy of infectious diseases.

Influenza viruses remain a major threat to human health and can cause severe symptoms in young, elderly, and immuno-compromised populations, leading to annual epidemics which endanger between 3 and 5 million people of severe illness and cause 290,000 to 650,000 deaths worldwide. These viruses primarily target respiratory epithelial cells to replicate, where they cause cell damage and death. Scientists have become aware that these epithelial cells are not mere passive barriers, helpless to attack, but instead are vital in driving the antiviral immune response. However, until now, our understanding of the mechanism underpinning that response has been very limited. Now, thanks to work performed by PhD student Coralie Guy, in the research team of Andrew Bowie, Professor of Innate Immunology in Trinity’s School of Biochemistry and Immunology, some answers have arisen. The team discovered that viral RNA and influenza viruses stimulate two different molecular pathways in which specific proteins set off chain reactions that result in two proteins called “gasdermin D” and “gasdermin E” being processed in such a way that they form membrane pores in the epithelial cells. These pores allow the release of special agent “cytokines” charged with sparking the immune system into life, and also cause death of the cells which prevents the virus spreading. To assess the importance of this finding, the team suppressed the formation of the gasdermin pores to see what would happen, and this resulted in increased replication of influenza viruses, underlining how important these gasdermins are in the antiviral response. The research has just been published in the journal iScience. Speaking about the research and its implications, Professor Bowie, who is based in Trinity’s Biomedical Sciences Institute, said: “By forming an EU-wide network of scientists with different expertise in immunology and virology, we were able to ask some fundamental questions about how our bodies respond to RNA viruses such as influenza and SARS-CoV-2. “We realised that very little was known about the initial response to viruses in those early moments when our lungs first encounter a virus. Through Coralie’s work we were able to make some important discoveries that highlight previously unknown aspects of the immune response to influenza, which we will now build on to examine how relevant they are to other viral infections of the lung, such as SARS-CoV-2 and RSV.” The journal article can be read on the publisher's website.

Recently, there were reports from animal health authorities in the country that scores of sea lions have been found dead on several coastal areas of Argentina’s Atlantic coast — south of the capital Buenos Aires to Santa Cruz near the southern tip of the continent. A statement from a Patagonian environmental authority stated: “Another 50 dead specimens have been counted… with symptoms compatible with avian influenza.” According to AFP, “the number of dead is rising and there is no veterinary treatment for these cases.” Authorities have asked the population to avoid beaches along Argentina’s roughly 5,000-kilometer (3,100-mile) coastline where cases have been reported. Sea lions are marine mammals, like seals and walruses and the adult males can weigh about 300 kilograms (660 pounds). The H5N1 bird flu has typically been confined to seasonal outbreaks, but since 2021 cases have emerged year-round, and across the globe, leading to what experts say is the largest outbreak ever seen. Hundreds of sea lions were reported dead in Peru earlier this year, as the virus has ravaged bird populations across South America. There is no treatment for bird flu, which spreads naturally between wild birds and can also infect domestic poultry. Avian influenza viruses do not typically infect humans, although there have been rare cases. Leave a comment Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.

Those locations included Puerto Loyola, Rio Grande, Necochea and La Loberia.In each of the cases, animal health officials were notified of the sea lion deaths, with the animals showing neurological symptoms that were compatible with HPAI. Samples were taken from the animals and sent to a, Argentina National Health Service and Food Quality (SENASA) laboratory. The samples were tested using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) testing, and those tests came back positive for an H5 variant of HPAI.Control measures put in use include official disposal of carcasses and waste, disinfection and surveillance within a restricted zone.WOAH listed the source of infections as unknown or inconclusive.Poultry in Argentina declared free of avian influenzaArgentina lost more than 2.2 million head of commercial poultry to HPAI. Those losses have occurred amid 18 cases, according to information from WOAH.Of those, thirteen were laying hen operations, two were broiler farms and three were unspecified poultry breeder operations.However, none of those cases have been recent, and on August 8, WOAH reported that the poultry industry in Argentina was now free of HPAI, as all cleanup and disinfection procedures at the affected premises have been completed and 28 days have elapsed since that completion date. Wild bird HPAI infections in Argentina A separate WOAH report stated that 9,542 other birds in Argentina have been lost to HPAI in 2023, with most of those being reported in domestic birds. Cases of HPAI in wild birds have also been reported, including the following species: Anatidae, black necked swans, rallidae, and Andean geese.RecommendedLatest NewsNational Turkey Federation offering 'Thanksgiving 101' tips and recipesLatest NewsHormel Foods honoredRelated StoriesLatin AmericaBrazil’s January-May chicken exports up stronglyLatin America2022 favored Latin America's egg sector, chicken declinedLatin AmericaJBS: Seara revenue down, but good things are happeningLatin AmericaMore avian influenza confirmed in EcuadorMore in Latin AmericaLatin AmericaPoultry, egg, pork information campaigns launch in BrazilTwo-month industry sponsored campaigns will highlight the health benefits of consuming the three proteins.Brand InsightsThink strategically in developing IBDV vaccination programsZoetisDeveloping vaccination programs for IBDV requires strategic use of several vaccine types.International TradeBrazil reports sharp rise in October chicken exportsCompared with the same month of 2023, chicken exports by Brazil were up 15% in volume, and 25% in revenue last month.Latin America Poultry at a GlanceMexico egg spoon race breaks Guinness world recordIn addition to having the highest rate of per capita egg consumption, Mexico beat London in a 100-meter race with 2,700 youngsters carrying an egg with a spoon.Poultry Around the WorldWill EU farmers take to streets if EU-Mercosur sign deal?From poultry producers to welfare organizations, discontent over possible free trade agreement shows no sign of ending.Latest NewsBrazil, US poultry sectors to work together for free tradeWorld’s two largest poultry meat exporters sign cooperation agreement to break down trade barriers.Latin America Poultry at a GlanceMore South American countries exporting poultryColombia and Ecuador are just another two Latin American nations with incipient exports, signaling a bright future for the region.Agrifood AngleDoes Marfrig-Minerva deal have implications for BRF?With the sale of assets in Brazil, Argentina and Chile, BRF’s majority shareholder has the potential to further invest.Nutrition & FeedAmlan International partners with Brazil's VetProDiseases & HealthNewcastle disease outbreak in Brazil has been resolvedOne flock was infected in July, and since that time, the premises is free of the virus and no cases have appeared elsewhere in the country.Latin America Poultry at a GlanceArgentina on the verge of recouping chicken exportsWith large domestic chicken consumption per capita and exports to 75 markets, the Argentinian poultry industry is recouping after the avian flu outbreaks.Latin AmericaBrazilian egg exports to return to growth in 2025Brazil’s egg exporters are confident of a return to growth next year with eight target markets subject to extra focus.Latin America Poultry at a GlanceWorld Egg Day celebrated in Latin AmericaIn a region with very high egg consumption rates, each country focused its efforts on several fronts, from tackling malnutrition to teaching university students about what eggs provide.Page 1 of 117Next PageNews and analysis for the global poultry industryFollow WATTPoultry.comFacebook iconLinkedIn iconYouTube iconDelete My DataTopicsPoultry MeatEggPoultry HealthSustainabilityPoultry FutureMoreWebinarsBrand InsightsPodcastsWhite PapersWATT Poultry ChatTop Companies Data DownloadsMagazinesSubscribeAdvertiseAbout UsContact UsMedia RequestPrivacy PolicySite Map© 2024 All rights reserved.Most avian flu outbreaks in India reported from post-monsoon to pre-summer season: study -

The viruses are known to cause infections in humans with a history of close contact with infected poultry, resulting in mild-to-severe respiratory disease and even fatality. Now, a study has shed more light on outbreaks of HPAI in India.(For top health news of the day, subscribe to our newsletter Health Matters)According to the latest research paper “Spatio-temporal distribution and seasonality of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 and H5N8 outbreaks in India, 2006-2021”, published in the Indian Journal of Medical Research, a total of 284 H5N1 outbreaks were reported since 2006 with a surge in 2021. The initial outbreaks of H5N1 were predominantly in poultry. Similarly, since 2016, 57 outbreaks of H5N8 were also reported, predominantly in wild birds. It further noted that most of the outbreaks of HPAI were reported between post-monsoon and pre-summer season (i.e. between October and March), with their peak in January, during winter.Apart from poultry, bird species such as owl, Indian peafowl, lesser adjutant, crows, and wild migratory birds such as demoiselle crane, northern pintail, and bar-headed goose tested positive for HPAI.“Studies on the seasonality of HPAI outbreaks would help in the development of prevention and control strategies. Recent human infections of H5N1 and H9N2 viruses highlight the need to strengthen surveillance in wild, resident, migratory birds and in poultry,’‘ noted the paper.For the paper, data on the occurrence and locations of outbreaks in India and affected bird species were collated from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations database and grouped by month and year. The distribution and seasonality of HPAI H5N1 and H5N8 viruses were analysed.Also read | Why environmental surveillance for avian influenza is vitalAs of December 2021, H5N1 virus outbreaks were documented on a large scale among poultry and wild birds in more than 77 countries. And as of March 2022, 863 human cases of avian influenza (AI) H5N1 were reported worldwide with an average case fatality ratio of 53%.According to the paper a significant rise in HPAI outbreaks in domestic and wild birds had been reported in October 2021, signalling expanded virus circulation. The first human case of H5N1 virus infection in India was reported in June 2021, coinciding with the monsoon season in the country.“The HPAI H5N1 viruses are constantly evolving globally through complex genetic changes, which have infected poultry, wild birds as well as humans,’‘ noted the study.As per the paper, the first HPAI H5N1 outbreak in India was reported in 2006 from Navapur, Maharashtra, followed by a series of outbreaks annually. Later, from 2007 to 2010, most of the outbreaks were reported from the eastern and northeastern States but predominantly from West Bengal. Odisha reported outbreaks from 2011 to 2020, with the highest in 2018. The H5N8 virus was first reported in India in November 2016, with mortality in wild birds from five States, and Kerala reported most number of events (25). There were no reports of H5N8 from India in the years 2018 and 2019. A sudden rise in the number of H5N8 outbreaks was reported from 2020 onwards, indicating a probable reintroduction of the virus.

COVID hospitalizations are low but have increased for six weeks in a row and there's a new variant labeled as "highly transmissible."Doctors are calling it a trifecta of infections ready to pounce as the temperatures drop. Some are already masking to guard against a COVID-19 comeback."I go to Trader Joe's all the time and I wear a mask. So I figured, if I wear a mask, the chances are somewhat less than I get infected by this thing," Daniel Berman said.Experts say the three infections -- RSV, influenza and COVID-19 -- are expected to circulate in the U.S. over the next few months. "We see changing patterns of people going back to school, people being indoors and in close proximity to each other and that is what usually kicks off respiratory virus season," Anne Rimoin, an epidemiologist, said.RELATED: No mask mandate in Philadelphia schools for 2023-24 school yearA former White House advisor says people should take COVID-19 more seriously."We've never gotten to zero. The hospital admissions have never got to zero. Now we're living in a bit of a fantasy world where we're pretending that COVID is not relevant," Dr. Deborah Birx, who was on the former White House Coronavirus Response Task Force, said. What are the symptoms of the new COVID variant BA2.86? Do vaccines work against it?The new COVID variant BA2.86 -- newly detected in the United States -- appears to be more contagious than previous strains, but not as dangerous.The symptoms are no different than other strains of COVID including: runny nose, sneezing, sore throat, coughing, as well as fatigue, headaches and muscle aches, and potential changes to your sense of smell.An updated COVID-19 vaccine is expected soon. The CDC says it currently assesses that the updated vaccine "will be effective at reducing severe disease and hospitalization." "We do expect the CDC to have a meeting on Sept. 12 and make recommendations use for the new formulation of the vaccine and it should be available shortly after," Dr. Dean Blumberg said.The yearly flu vaccine will also be available soon, and RSV shots are recommended for high-risk groups."In general, if you're not feeling well, if you're sick, the best thing to do is to avoid contact with other people if you can, in particular people who are vulnerable," Rimoin said. Doctors say an updated COVID vaccine is important because immunity eventually weakens and the older shots don't guard against the new variants.

Study: Mortality associated with Omicron and influenza infections in France before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Image Credit: Luca9257 / Shutterstock.com How did the Omicron variant affect France? The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant is associated with a lower risk for severe outcomes than the Delta variant in adults. However, following the emergence of the Omicron variant, France experienced a spike in severe outcomes unrelated to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in SARS-CoV-2-positive patients. More specifically, Omicron significantly contributed to mortality from cardiac issues, cancer, and neurological disorders. Despite the profound impact of influenza infections in France during December 2022, testing and antiviral use remained inconsistent. This is compounded by low influenza vaccination rates in France, especially among healthcare workers in elderly care facilities. Further research investigating the impact of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza on health outcomes to ultimately guide effective vaccination strategies and healthcare policies, especially for vulnerable populations, is necessary. About the study In the present study, researchers utilized aggregate, de-identified public data to investigate the impact of various influenza subtypes and SARS-CoV-2 on mortality rates in metropolitan France. Key datasets included the French sentinel surveillance for influenza-like illness (ILI) consultations, World Health Organization (WHO) FluNET for influenza subtype testing, and electronic records for COVID-19-related deaths. Importantly, not every ILI consultation translates to an influenza infection, and multiple influenza subtypes can cause ILI. Thus, incidence indicators were established for each influenza subtype and correlated ILI consultation rates with the percentage of specimens positive for that subtype. This methodology is crucial when considering that the age distribution of influenza cases varies with the emergence of antigenically novel strains, thus impacting the relationship between influenza-associated ILI rates and mortality. During the observation period, several significant antigenic changes were reported. These included the introduction of a new A/H3N2 strain in the 2014-2015 season, a novel B/Yamagata strain in 2017-2018, and diverse A/H3N2 epidemic strains in 2018-2019. These shifts required the researchers to segment the A/H3N2 incidence indicator into distinct periods and similarly bifurcate the B/Yamagata incidence indicator based on its epidemic emergence. A one to two week delay between influenza illness onset and associated mortality was also considered in the analysis. For SARS-CoV-2-related deaths, weekly rates of deaths in which COVID-19 was explicitly mentioned on the death certificate was used as an indicator. In the regression model, data was considered from week three in 2015 to week two in 2020, and then from week 33 in 2022 to week 12 in 2023. Study results Before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the interplay between baseline mortality rates, trends, and the influence of influenza infections was evident. However, between week 33 in 2022 and week 12 in 2023, the model indicates that SARS-CoV-2 infections accounted for the majority of the heightened mortality.

Meta-analysis highlights potential ICU reductionFrom the 2014-2015 season to 2018-2019, influenza contributed to an annual average death toll of 15,654 with a 95% confidence interval of 13,013-18,340. In contrast, between week 33 of 2022 and week 12 of 2023, 7,851 influenza-related deaths and 32,607 deaths associated with SARS-CoV-2 were reported. Between weeks 33-52 of 2022, 23,983 SARS-CoV-2-related deaths were recorded in France. This estimate contrasts with the 12,811 deaths that explicitly listed COVID-19 on the death certificate and 8,639 in-hospital deaths attributed to COVID-19 during that same period. Discussion In the winter of 2022-2023, France experienced excess mortality levels comparable to the initial COVID-19 wave in April 2020. This spike was primarily attributed to the emergence of the Omicron variant and concurrent influenza outbreak. Strikingly, many individuals who died from Omicron infection had comorbid conditions other than COVID-19 as the primary cause, which is a trend distinct from earlier SARS-CoV-2 strains. Death certificates often do not mention influenza as the cause, despite its association with mortality. This necessitates the need for additional research to elucidate the impacts of both viruses, especially among patients with health complications. In 2022 alone, the study recorded higher Omicron-associated deaths than those that explicitly listed COVID-19 on their certificates, with the Omicron strain significantly affecting cardiac and mental health patients. Pre-pandemic data indicated the enduring presence of influenza, as it was responsible for a significant proportion of deaths each year. However, influenza vaccine uptake in France remains low, especially among non-elderly adults and children, all of whom are pivotal transmitters of the flu. The elderly, a significant portion of mortality statistics, are further compromised by low vaccination rates among their healthcare providers. Therefore, the need for broader vaccination coverage, for both COVID-19 and influenza, is paramount, along with refining treatment and detection measures. Journal reference: Goldstein, E. (2023).

Wang et al. Nature Immunology https://doi.org/10.1038/s41590-023-01428-x (2023)In their recent publication, Wang et al. propose that influenza infection in the lungs confers resistance to metastatic tumor growth due to trained immunity in the alveolar macrophage (AM) compartment, underpinned by enhanced pro-inflammatory cytokine production, augmented phagocytosis and metabolic rewiring1. Although these findings are broadly in line with prior work demonstrating that viral infections can cause long-lasting changes in the AM compartment, affecting subsequent challenges2,3,4,5, many of these earlier studies attributed functional changes to monocyte-derived AMs emerging during infection2,3,4 rather than training of pre-existing AMs. In light of this discrepancy, we believe that there is insufficient consideration of AM origin in the study by Wang et al. to formally claim that the mechanism of tumor protection is trained immunity. We believe that strategies chosen for cellular identification and purification as well as data interpretation do not fully take into account the importance of recruited monocyte-derived AMs, which share functions with trained AMs, and may therefore be mistaken as such.

Li et al. show in a recent study that intratracheal influenza A virus (IAV) infection in mice induces bone marrow monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages (AMs) (BMoAMs) characterized by lower sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin F (Siglec-F) expression than that of embryonic- or fetal monocyte-derived AMs (FeMoAMs)3, and Iliakis et al. argue that elevated immunoreactivity in AMs after intranasal IAV infection in our study is due to recruited BMoAMs having what they call a ‘monocyte legacy’ instead of training of FeMoAMs1. Iliakis et al. further speculate that BMoAMs were excluded in our flow cytometry analysis, as these cells resemble interstitial macrophages (IMs) in the Siglec-F–Ly6C dot plot (Extended Data Fig. 1a in ref. 2).

Last flu season — which typically runs from November to March in Canada — saw a surge of all three respiratory viruses across the country, especially among children, which was exacerbated by a scarcity of pain relievers, leading to increased hospitalizations and heightened emergency room visits.The triple threat of respiratory viruses is expected to hit Canadians again, Toronto Public Health’s associate medical officer of health Dr. Vinita Dubey said at a virtual Ontario Medical Association (OMA) conference on Aug. 24.“We take our lead from what’s happened in the Southern Hemisphere because their winter is before ours,” she said. Story continues below advertisement “And they certainly have had a busy season with those three viruses, and we did see that again here last year as well, too. So we are expecting this fall to see a heavy respiratory virus season, particularly with those three, RSV, influenza and COVID, among the other viruses spread around that time.”It may be the first year since the pandemic is no longer considered a global health emergency, “but COVID is still here,” she added. 1:19 Flu season: ‘Red flag waving at us right now,’ official says amid increase in child hospitalizations Australia’s flu season has long been looked at by Canadian health experts in preparation for flu season here. This year’s influenza season in Australia has revealed a significant trend: children aged 16 and younger bore the brunt, constituting 72 per cent of hospital admissions, according to Australian health data. The season was also met with high RSV rates. Story continues below advertisement Dr. Prabhat Jha, an epidemiologist at Unity Health Toronto, said the severity of this flu season remains uncertain for now, but a potentially clearer picture may emerge by the end of September, in terms of COVID-19 cases.“When schools reopen and activity assumes in the post-vacation period in September, then towards the end of September, we’ll have some sense of how large the increases might be and we’ll have wastewater and other data to give us some sense of how widespread it is,” he said.“The flu season, when that arrives is typically a bit later, along with the RSV season.” What to expect for this fall's flu season While cases of respiratory illnesses are currently relatively low, Dr. Andrew Parks, the president of OMA, warned illnesses are likely to rise as the fall and winter set in. Story continues below advertisement “Historically, we see the rates of these viruses increase in the fall as temperatures drop and people spend more time indoors,” he said during the virtual conference Thursday.

Influenza, RSV and COVID-19 are all primarily transmitted through respiratory droplets. When people gather indoors during colder months, especially in close proximity, these viruses can spread more easily.RSV and the flu, which typically emerge a bit later in the fall and winter seasons, started earlier than usual last year, meaning all three viruses peaked around the same time.Last flu season, children’s hospitals across Canada reported significant surges in patients, which led many to cancel major surgeries in order to redeploy staff to help in overcrowded emergency departments and intensive care units. 2:17 ‘Tridemic’ causing new health-care impacts across Canada The situation was further exacerbated by a scarcity of pediatric acetaminophen and ibuprofen and the reopening of school, work and indoor gatherings as COVID-19 mandates lifted. Story continues below advertisement In his two decades of practice, Anthony Crocco, an emergency room pediatrician at McMaster Children’s Hospital in Hamilton, Ont., said he witnessed the most severe surge of respiratory viruses during last year’s flu season.“Across the board, we were not only seeing high volume but along with that high acuity with children requiring significant respiratory support and intensive care admission,” he said. “With that experience now… we are now thinking about that as our high watermark that we should be prepared for.” How doctors, hospitals are preparing Whether on the provincial, regional or institutional level, there is a concern that “there is going to be another surge of multiple viruses,” this fall season, Crocco warned.There needs to be a plan in place to navigate the upcoming season, such as increasing staffing and bed capacity and making sure operating rooms are still functioning, he said. Story continues below advertisement Another plan to help relieve pressure on hospitals is to redirect patients (who have less severe symptoms) out of the emergency department and guide them towards alternative health care facilities, such as cough and cold clinics, family physicians or urgent care.For example, he said, come mid-September, McMaster Children’s Hospital is launching a rapid access area designed to treat children with less severe symptoms of viral infections.“To try and redirect them away from the emergency department where we may need those resources allocated for more serious, seriously impacted children,” he explained.

The objective is to promptly evaluate patients and discharge them in a timely way, he said. Trending Now RCMP report reveals new details on GTA man and his ‘camel-toe’ fake toonies 6.8 magnitude earthquake shakes Cuba after hurricanes and blackouts “So we’re hopeful that that will address some of the increased volumes that we’re seeing,” Crocco said.Preparations for the upcoming flu season extend beyond hospitals and emergency rooms, but involve family physicians as well, Park said.“From a practice standpoint, is to ensure that our primary care physicians have a stable supply of their vaccines and are ready to go. That they have a supply of personal protective equipment (PPE) to ensure that when their patients are sick, they are protecting themselves,” he said. Story continues below advertisement How to protect yourself In an effort to mitigate the transmission of the trio of viruses — RSV, influenza, and COVID-19 — Dubey encourages Canadians to prioritize hygiene practices and ensure their vaccinations are current.“If you are sick, stay home. If your child has a fever, if they have a new or worsening cough, if they have respiratory symptoms that can spread to others, vomiting and diarrhea… keep your child at home,” she said.“The goal is not to keep them home indefinitely, but when symptoms are improving for 24 hours they can return back to school.”Similar to the measures implemented during the pandemic, Dubey emphasized the significance of preventive actions, including frequent handwashing, proper cough etiquette, maximizing outdoor time, and acknowledging the need for heightened precautions among individuals at greater risk (such as wearing masks). Story continues below advertisement And then there is the importance of vaccines, she said.At the beginning of August, Health Canada approved the first vaccine for RSV for adults aged 60 and over. There is no RSV vaccine for children, but there are two kinds of antibody injections that can be given to high-risk babies to help prevent serious illness.“We know that RSV and flu, those two viruses can be more serious in children, especially young children. What we learned from the Southern Hemisphere, from Australia and New Zealand, is that children were more impacted by influenza this season. But we also learned that influenza virus strains that circulated were a good match with the vaccine,” Dubey said. 5:46 WHO concerned with resurgence of COVID The fall influenza booster is not yet available but typically rolls out in October, she said. Story continues below advertisement “S0 parents can add to the list, by getting the flu vaccine in the fall. In particular, getting their children vaccinated, and that will be really important for keeping children from getting really sick from the flu,” she said.“The flu vaccine and the COVID vaccine can be given at the same time this fall.”As new COVID-19 variants start to circulate across the globe and in Canada, updated booster shots are also expected to roll out this fall.Canada’s National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) released fall booster guidance in July, recommending a dose of the new formulation of the COVID-19 vaccine.NACI said all Canadians aged five years and up should get a COVID-19 booster in the fall if it has been at least six months since their last vaccine dose or infection, whichever is later.In an email to Global News on Monday, a spokesperson from Health Canada said the department is, “actively reviewing the submissions received from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, seeking authorization for the use of their respective COVID-19 vaccines containing the XBB.1.5 Omicron subvariant, for persons six months and older.

Will parents choose a booster for their students, when the new covid shot is released in med-September?(Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)TOPICS:COVIDVaccineStudentsSchoolVaccinationsHealthDavidsonWashingtonSHORLIINE, Wash. — Only a fraction of classrooms in western Washington have kids in them, but more students will be packed in together again in the coming weeks. So, what does this mean for the spread of COVID-19?Numbers from across the country, where students returned to class weeks ago, show there's still a huge risk of kids getting sick, infecting others and then missing critical education time.“If you don’t stay healthy, then you’ll be all sick. You don’t, you don’t want to infect your friends,” student David Erazo said after getting his routine vaccinations at the International Community Services Clinic (ICSH) in Shoreline.The clinic partnered with the Shoreline School District (SSD) to provide dozens of vaccines to kids in need.Norah Davidson and her brother Malcolm also braved the needle sticks in their arms.“I was feeling this weird feeling when you’re like excited to get your shot because you get to go in the third grade,” said Norah.RELATED | CDC director visits western Washington to talk COVID-19 and back to schoolNorah’s dad, Aaron Davidson, told KOMO News his family always stays on top of their vaccinations.“Don’t put it off. I got three vaccines for my kids, two for one and one for the other,” said Davidson, who also has a preschooler at home.“I always have a stuffy nose ‘cause I’ve had a kid under the age of 3 for the last eight years of my life,” Davidson said. “There’s always something new that they’re going to come home and bring home.”“We want them to be back in school, we want them to be vaccinated, we want to make sure parents are taking the appropriate precautions,” said Washington state Secretary of Health Dr. Umair Shah.The COVID vaccine is not yet available, but already some worry the new COVID vaccine will be out of date when it's available in mid-September.“COVID variants have been evolving very quickly. The data has been showing that the vaccines have been safe and effective and keeping children out of the hospital,” said Dr. Dennis Pang, the pediatrician administering vaccines during the back-to-school clinic at ICHS.Officials at a Kentucky school had to shut it down less than two weeks into the new school year when 20% of its students tested positive for COVID, strep throat or influenza. COVID numbers are also on the rise in Los Angeles and New York City, but experts say there is no need to panic.ALSO SEE | FDA approves RSV vaccine for moms-to-be to guard their newborns“The good news is we have more tools than ever before for folks to protect themselves,” said Dr. Mandy Cohen, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).“The state of Washington, it’s done quite well,’ Cohen told KOMO News, “They’re a leader in the country and doing work to protect the public health, but I want to make sure that folks are hearing from me that the coming fall and winter means we’re going to see more viruses circulating.”“(Seattle Public Schools) did an incredible job the last year and a half, last two years, my kids were in first and second grade. There is only one day when (schools) were closed unexpectedly due to COVID,” said Davidson.Most school districts are still using their COVID policies from last school year, reminding families to continue practicing good hygiene and keeping students home when they’re sick.“I mean, lots of people already got the vaccine, so I think the danger is less. So I’m not really that worried,” said Sebastian Erazo, a 13-year-old entering eighth grade at Einstein Middle School.“While I’m worried about the chance of them getting COVID or vaccine, we’ve all had it, and we also have these vaccines. A two-pronged approach, and that way puts me at ease. There isn’t really a perfect one size fits all solution, but we end up getting in our own briefcase full of 100 million different chances to fight the vaccine. Maybe the next mutation won’t get us,” said Davidson.“But we know that (the vaccine) helps prevent you from getting seriously ill,” said Pang.“We can do our part by making sure we’re safe ourselves, and we’re not carrying it over to people who can’t get the vaccine, which is more people than I thought,” said Davidson.The new COVID shot is expected to be available by mid-September.Health experts still recommend getting the COVID and flu shots for everyone who can get those vaccines.The Bellevue School District (BSD) is working to help its families prepare for a healthy start to the school year with two health fairsthis week.Wednesday’s health fair is at Chinook Middle School and Thursday’s will be at Odle Middle School.

The flu vaccine and new COVID vaccine aren't available yet, but the BSD Health Fair is offering required vaccines and other resources for parents to make sure their kids are ready for a healthy school year.BSD nurses, athletic activities and technology departments will all be onsite during the health fair to answer questions and provide more resources.

Produced by Twitter Facebook Email Download PDF Preschools and nursing homes were significant sites for COVID-19 infection clusters, and have historically been hotspots for other potentially fatal respiratory viruses, including seasonal waves of influenza.In Japan, the intense research effort to understand and control the spread of COVID-19, enabled in part by the supercomputer Fugaku at the RIKEN Center for Computational Science in Kobe, played a key role in minimizing transmission.The lessons learned from this work, especially regarding building ventilation, are expected to have a lasting benefit in protecting vulnerable people. As well as enhancing future pandemic preparedness, the work could help to minimize the seasonal spread and fatality rate of flu and other airborne viruses.Visualizations of aerosol spread produced using RIKEN’s Fugaku supercomputer were released directly to the public during the pandemic.A PROMISING PIVOT When COVID-19 hit, Makoto Tsubokura, a professor of computational fluid dynamics at Kobe University, and a team leader at the RIKEN Center for Computational Science, had been using Fugaku in collaborative research with car companies to simulate the behaviour of fuel droplets in internal combustion engines, as a tool for improved engine design.“After the pandemic started, our staff went into lockdown,” Tsubokura says. “Our team discussed how we could contribute to the pandemic response. One of our youngest researchers suggested that we modify our engine simulation software for simulations of aerosol droplet dispersion.”Virus-carrying aerosol droplets exhaled by infected people were already a well-established potential route of respiratory infection spread, and over the course of the pandemic, aerosols were proven to be a key mode of COVID-19 transmission.Within a month of starting the project in April 2020, Tsubokura and his team had adapted their fuel-dispersion simulation software to model and generate visual representations of aerosol spread. “The dispersion of aerosols and fuels are actually very similar in terms of the physics,” Tsubokura explains.The group’s efforts formed a key part of the Japanese government’s COVID-19 AI & Simulation Project, a programme that brought research teams from different disciplines together to quickly provide scientific evidence in response to the unfolding pandemic.In 2020, Fugaku was the world’s the fastest supercomputer, and by using it to simulate aerosol spread in different enclosed environments, the team established the value and importance of infection reduction measures such as face masks, room partitions and building ventilation. The team simulated more than 1,500 different cases in more than 70 social situations, including in commuter trains, karaoke rooms, nursery schools and facilities for the elderly.“Fugaku’s enormous computational power allowed us to perform risk assessments for various infection scenes within the urgent timescales needed,” Tsubokura says.Crucially, the team could generate vivid visual representations of aerosol spread, which were made readily available to the media and shared widely with the public.1 “Visualizing the dispersion of aerosols is helpful to understand infection spread,” Tsubokura says. “Our main contribution to the pandemic effort was to grow societal awareness and understanding.”This powerful public health messaging contributed to the suppression of the spread of infection, especially in the early stages of the pandemic in Japan. In November 2021, the team received the Association for Computing Machinery’s Gordon Bell Special Prize for High Performance Computing Based COVID-19 Research, for the simulation’s capacity to rapidly simulate aerosol behaviour at high resolution and scale.Fugaku (pictured) was the world’s fastest supercomputer in 2020. Credit: RIKENREAL WORLD RESULTS Since establishing the aerosol simulation methodology at the start of the pandemic, Tsubokura’s work in the area has continued to expand. “We are not specialists in aerosol or indoor environment research, so we asked other researchers to join this project to support our simulations,” he says.A key collaboration was forged with Motoya Hayashi from Hokkaido University, an expert in the indoor environment and its influence on human health.2 “I organized a team to assess and measure ventilation performance in real buildings,” Hayashi explains. “We confirmed poor ventilation in buildings where infection clusters occurred, demonstrating the importance of ventilation measures against aerosol infections,” he says.Opening windows for natural airflow is deeply rooted in Japanese culture, and reflected in the country’s architecture, but this alone may not achieve sufficient airflow to sweep away virus-carrying aerosols and droplets, Hayashi showed.“We focused on nursery schools where many clusters occurred, and care facilities for the elderly,” he says. In a representative range of such buildings, ventilation performance was measured, improvements were planned and implemented, and the effect of the changes were measured. Following the team’s analysis, a series of building ventilation case studies were released. “Our aim is to make the importance of ventilation understood by the public,” Hayashi says.As well as opening windows for natural ventilation, the use of well-maintained mechanical ventilation, adjusted to increase the intake of outdoor air, was recommended.Throwing open the windows is not necessarily good advice in mid-summer or mid-winter, Hayashi notes.3 During these periods, good mechanical ventilation combined with air conditioning or heating is required to simultaneously achieve high air exchange while maintaining a healthy indoor temperature and humidity.The vital importance of ventilation system upkeep in healthcare settings was also highlighted. “In hospitals, ventilation facilities are often poorly maintained, which increases the risk of infection,” Hayashi says. “In the wake of investigation on infection clusters, researchers have begun to review building ventilation design and maintenance.”Collaborating with Hayashi’s group has been mutually beneficial, Tsubokura notes. “Their experimental measurement of actual facilities enabled us to improve the accuracy of the simulation,” he says. “In addition, by performing simulations that would be difficult to measure experimentally, and sharing the results, the Hayashi group could develop more effective ventilation recommendations,” he adds.Although the COVID-19 global public health emergency has been declared over by the World Health Organization, current and future respiratory infections remain a significant health threat, and the team’s work continues. “We are now working with Hayashi’s group to quantify of the effectiveness of infection countermeasures in kindergartens,” Tsubokura says.During the pandemic, groups from disparate research areas, including infectious diseases, public health, architecture, information and biosensor technology, came together to collaborate toward the shared goal of healthier indoor air, Hayashi notes. “Such collaboration must continue.” ReferencesAndo, K. et al.

Share Bird Flu Kills Scores of Sea Lions in Argentina share Print Buenos Aires — Scores of sea lions have died from bird flu in Argentina, officials said Tuesday, as an unprecedented global outbreak continues to infect mammals, raising fears it could spread more easily among humans. Animal health authorities have recently reported dead sea lions in several locations along Argentina's extensive Atlantic coast, from just south of the capital Buenos Aires to Santa Cruz near the southern tip of the continent. Another "50 dead specimens have been counted ... with symptoms compatible with avian influenza," read a statement from a Patagonian environmental authority. Authorities have asked the population to avoid beaches along Argentina's roughly 5,000-kilometer coastline where cases have been reported. Sea lions are marine mammals, like seals and walruses. Adult males can weigh about 300 kilograms. The H5N1 bird flu has typically been confined to seasonal outbreaks, but since 2021 cases have emerged year-round, and across the globe, leading to what experts say is the largest outbreak ever seen. Hundreds of sea lions were reported dead in Peru earlier this year, as the virus has ravaged bird populations across South America. There is no treatment for bird flu, which spreads naturally between wild birds and also can infect domestic poultry. Avian influenza viruses do not typically infect humans, although there have been rare cases. The outbreak has infected several mammal species, however, such as farmed minks and cats, and the World Health Organization warned in July this could help it adapt to infect humans more easily. "Some mammals may act as mixing vessels for influenza viruses, leading to the emergence of new viruses that could be more harmful to animals and humans," the WHO said in a statement.

AP Fact Check A study by Fauci and colleagues didn’t blame 1918 Spanish flu deaths on masks FILE - In this Dec. 22, 2020, file photo, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, speaks before receiving his first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine at the National Institutes of Health, in Bethesda, Md. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky, Pool, File) By Angelo Fichera Share Share Copy Link copied Email Facebook X Reddit LinkedIn Pinterest Flipboard Print CLAIM: A study co-authored by Dr. Anthony Fauci showed that “most of the deaths” during the 1918-1919 Spanish flu pandemic were actually due to infections from face masks.AP’S ASSESSMENT: False. The study in question made no mention of masks. Instead, it found that many of the deaths were likely caused by a secondary bacterial pneumonia that followed influenza infection. There is no evidence masks were responsible, Fauci told The Associated Press.THE FACTS: As new COVID-19 variants circulate, social media users are again spreading false and misleading claims about mitigation measures such as masks.Some are erroneously claiming that a study written by Fauci, the former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, found that mask-wearing was responsible for the wave of deaths seen during a pandemic a century ago.

Here are the facts “Even back to the 1918 Spanish Flu, it was shown in a paper written by Fauci that most of the deaths that occurred during the Spanish flu, were not the Spanish flu — the virus — it was actually secondary infections due to wearing those stupid cotton masks,” a man claims in a video clip shared on Instagram. “So people need to be aware.”The paper actually didn’t mention masks at all.Fauci and two NIAID colleagues published the 2008 study in the Journal of Infectious Diseases, examining lung tissue from autopsies and other data and concluding that “the majority of deaths in the 1918–1919 influenza pandemic likely resulted directly from secondary bacterial pneumonia caused by common upper respiratory-tract bacteria.” But that doesn’t mean the flu wasn’t to blame.In describing the study’s findings in 2008, the National Institute of Health noted that “most victims succumbed to bacterial pneumonia following influenza virus infection.”It added: “The pneumonia was caused when bacteria that normally inhabit the nose and throat invaded the lungs along a pathway created when the virus destroyed the cells that line the bronchial tubes and lungs.” In other words: “Certain people who developed primary viral pneumonia also had a secondary complication of bacterial infection that contributed to their deaths. However, the primary culprit was the influenza virus,” Fauci said in an email to the AP.“The 1918 influenza pandemic was caused by the H1N1 influenza virus,” he wrote.Fauci called claims to the contrary, or that the deaths were attributable to masks, “nonsense.”There is “absolutely no evidence that masks had anything to do with contributing to bacterial pneumonia,” Fauci added. RELATED COVERAGE Fauci didn’t say that unvaccinated people must be locked down this winter Conspiracy theorist spreads false information about the return of COVID-19 mandates The CDC didn’t say vaccinated people are more at risk of a new COVID variant than the unvaccinated Dr. Howard Markel, a medical historian at the University of Michigan who was not involved in the study, concurred, saying that claims the flu were unrelated to the deaths in 1918 “is a gross misreading of the paper.”Deaths from secondary bacterial pneumonia were “quite common for most flu deaths in the era before antibiotics,” he said in an email.___This is part of AP’s effort to address widely shared misinformation, including work with outside companies and organizations to add factual context to misleading content that is circulating online.

After more than a year of combating an outbreak of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza, afflicting poultry farms across the commonwealth, state officials said Wednesday that Pennsylvania has received the “all clear” to resume normal international poultry trade. State officials announced that Pennsylvania had received the “HPAI-free” designation from The World Animal Health Organization on Wednesday, celebrating the good news for Pennsylvania’s $7.1 billion poultry industry. State Agriculture Secretary Russell Redding praised private and governmental partnerships for seeing Pennsylvania through the outbreak, which began in April 2022. Deadly bird flu sweeps states, including Pa., straining farmers | Analysis “Pennsylvania’s coordinated, aggressive, and effective response to the hi-path avian influenza outbreak has brought us to this point,” Redding said. “Planning, coordination, and critical partnerships forged among every level of the industry, working in concert with two Pennsylvania government administrations, including the Department and PA Veterinary Diagnostic Lab System, the USDA, and Penn State Extension, have made the difference in minimizing the impact of what has been the costliest animal agriculture emergency in U.S. history.” HI-PATH is highly contagious and can infect both birds and humans, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The outbreak of the current HI-PATH strain has affected 31 commercial flocks, 36 backyard flocks, and caused the loss of 4,648,240 domestic birds, according to state agriculture officials. The last confirmed infection of the current strain of highly pathogenic avian flu in Pennsylvania was on March 17, 2023, in Lancaster County. While farm-specific restrictions were lifted earlier this month, the commonwealth remains under “general quarantine,” with the department continuing to monitor and test for infections statewide.

Dozens of cases on beaches and in protected areas have already been confirmedSea lions — some dead — lie on the beach of Punta Bermeja, in Argentine Patagonia, on August 28, 2023.Juan Macri (AP)Constanza LambertucciBuenos Aires - Aug 30, 2023 - 22:14CESTWhatsappFacebookTwitterLinkedinCopy linkIn early August, about 20 sea lions were found dead off the coast of Tierra del Fuego, in the southernmost tip of Argentina. Analysis confirmed that seven of these marine mammals were infected with the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus, or bird flu. Since then, the authorities have reported outbreaks in different provinces across the country. The virus has spread rapidly to the south of the continent ever since a case was detected in wild birds in Colombia in late 2022. Scientists are now studying the possible risks that could arise should it reach Antarctica.The latest positive cases detected in Argentine sea lions were reported this past Monday. The authorities subsequently released a statement warning that “the alert remains in place.”Samples were taken from mammals found dead in the cities of Claromecó and San Blas, in the province of Buenos Aires, as well as in the city of San Antonio Este, in the province of Río Negro. Before this, scientists identified cases on different beaches and protected areas in the provinces of Tierra del Fuego, Río Negro, Chubut and Buenos Aires.“This outbreak in sea lions began in Peru, then it passed to Chile and now it’s reaching Argentina,” warns Pablo Plaza, a biologist and researcher at CONICET, the main organization dedicated to promoting scientific research in Argentina. The virus has affected, above all, the Otaria flavescens species — commonly known as the Patagonia sea lion — a brown carnivore that can weigh up to 800 pounds. “There are two hypotheses here,” Dr. Plaza explains: “Either they were infected because they were in contact with infected birds — which is the most likely [scenario] — or the virus, in some way, underwent a mutation and is now being transmitted from sea lion to sea lion.”The bird flu currently circulating around the world — H5N1 — was derived from a pathogen first detected in geese raised in China, back in 1996. It’s a highly contagious subtype that has led to the unprecedented spread of the disease in birds. From Asia, it went to Africa and Europe — where more than 50 million poultry were slaughtered in a year to contain the outbreak — and, from there, it reached North America via Iceland, according to scientists. In October 2022, it was detected for the first time in wild birds in Colombia. It has now spread throughout South America.From birds, the virus jumped to mammals. “When it reaches the fauna, it’s a problem, because you cannot easily handle wild animals,” Plaza emphasizes. In Peru and Chile — where the situation was especially serious — more than 15,000 infected sea lions died, according to the researcher’s data. Other estimates calculate that there were more than 20,000 deaths. “In the coming weeks, we’ll have more evidence of the real scope of this outbreak in Argentina,” the biologist notes.The southernmost case of H5N1 in a sea lion was detected back in June, in Puerto Williams, Chile. A report published on August 23 by the OFFLU — the global network of animal influenza experts — notes that “there’s a substantial risk” that the spread “will continue southward and reach Antarctica and its offshore islands,” where the virus still isn’t present. “This risk may increase in the coming months, due to the spring migration of wild birds,” the report reads. It warns that the “negative impact” of the virus on the ecosystem “could be immense.”“The whole world is on high alert with this virus,” Plaza explains. A team of Peruvian and Argentine scientists, including Plaza, warned this past January that the arrival of the bird flu virus on the continent threatened protected birds in South America. With the mass death of sea lions, the same team published the first draft of research suggesting the possibility that the pathogen may have mutated, to now be transmitted from mammal to mammal. “It’s one more step [towards being a] risk for human beings,” Plaza warns. However, he clarifies that the danger of this flu spreading between people is “low” — for now.In January, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) published an alert about the “unusual” detection of avian influenza outbreaks in the Americas, along with confirmation, for the first time, of a case of human infection in the region. The analysis of that first case — which occurred in Ecuador — revealed the worrying lack of controls and surveillance. By the first week of July 2023, 16 countries registered cases in animals, while two had confirmed human infections (Ecuador and Chile), according to data from PAHO. Since 2003, the virus has jumped to humans nearly 900 times, killing more than half of those who have been infected.To mitigate the spread, the Argentine authorities have recommended not handling dead animals or animals with suspicious symptoms, while avoiding direct contact (or pet contact) with these animals. Additionally, they have asked for citizens to notify them if they suspect that an animal may be infected with the virus. Dead animals that have been infected, or were suspected to have died from the virus, are buried by the authorities, so as to prevent any contamination or contagion from afflicting humans or other animals.Sign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage from EL PAÍS USA EditionTu suscripción se está usando en otro dispositivo¿Quieres añadir otro usuario a tu suscripción?Añadir usuarioContinuar leyendo aquíSi continúas leyendo en este dispositivo, no se podrá leer en el otro.¿Por qué estás viendo esto?Flecha Tu suscripción se está usando en otro dispositivo y solo puedes acceder a EL PAÍS desde un dispositivo a la vez.

To investigate this, we conducted a prospective, multicentre, non-randomized observational study assessing changes in disease activity, safety, and clinical tolerability of vaccination in 222 MS patients on disease-modifying drugs. The majority of patients were female (76.6%) and 89.6% had relapsing–remitting MS. The vaccines administered were primarily seasonal influenza (56.3%) or tetanus-based vaccines (33.8%). Disease activity, as measured by annualized relapse rate, decreased significantly from 0.64 the year prior to vaccination to 0.38 in the following year. Moreover, the extended disability status scale remained stable within six months after vaccination in comparison to pre-vaccination values. Side effects were reported in 19.2% of vaccinated subjects, most commonly local side effects (65.2%) or flu-like symptoms (34.8%). Our findings suggest that standard non-live vaccines are safe and well-tolerated in MS patients and do not negatively impact disease activity.

Infectious episodes and fever may lead to the deterioration of MS disease contributing to increased mortality rates compared to the normal population3. Prevention of infections is an important measure of medical care for patients with MS4,5. Patients and treating physicians have previously been concerned about reports of possible detrimental effects of vaccinations on the course of MS6,7. This may still lead to vaccine hesitancy in MS patients despite studies revealing that non-live vaccines are safe and treatment guidelines recommend consequent vaccination in these patients8,9.The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and MS disease activity following generally recommended vaccines in MS in a real-world situation.Patients, material and methodsThis prospective, multicentre, non-randomized observational study at specialized outpatient MS care centres included MS patients aged 18 to 70 years who had been on disease-modifying treatment (DMT) for at least six months and who had an indication for recommended preventive vaccination10. We excluded all patients with MS relapse or other disease activity during the previous six months before vaccination. Routine MRI evaluation was not planned in this study protocol.Participation in this study was offered to all patients who received licensed vaccinations on a routine basis. Details of MS disease, medical history, baseline characteristics and clinical examination were collected. Subjects received the respective vaccination in the deltoid muscle in an open-label manner. Subjects had follow-up visits after 1, 3, 6 and 12 months between 2010 and 2013. Local and systemic adverse events were registered at the first follow-up visit 4 weeks after vaccination. Data of pre-vaccination disease activity was collected from clinical records in a retrospective manner. MS relapse activity as well as expanded disability status scale (EDSS) after vaccination were monitored throughout follow-up visits prospectively. Relapses were confirmed by the treating neurologists and medical evaluation according to national guidelines following routine patient management and medical practice.The evaluation of the immune response to influenza and tick-born encephalitis (TBE) vaccines of patients presented in this study have previously been published11,12.All statistical analyses were performed using Prism 9 (9.1.2, GraphPad Software). Values were expressed as mean ± standard deviation. Mann–Whitney U-test was used to compare annualized relapse rates. All reported p-values are two-sided; values of 0.05 or less were considered to indicate statistical significance.The study was approved by the local ethics committee (Rostock HV 2010-0002) and registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02275741). The study was conducted in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonization Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice, the Declaration of Helsinki and all applicable national laws. Informed written consent was obtained from all participants before entry into the study.ResultsIn total 222 patients with MS were included in this analysis. The baseline characteristics of this cohort are summarized in Table 1. The majority of included subjects were female (76.6%), and most of the patients were affected by RR-MS (89.6%) and had a mean duration of disease of 8.5 ± 6.9 years. The mean EDSS score at vaccination was 2.3 ± 1.9.Table 1 Characteristics of the enrolled subjects.Full size tableThe majority of subjects received interferon-beta therapy (47.8%) at vaccination; other applied DMTs were glatiramer acetate (23.4%), natalizumab (11.7%), fingolimod (5.9%). Of the subjects 56.3% received seasonal influenza vaccination, 33,8% received tetanus-based vaccination, 9.0% had a TBE vaccination. The other subjects were vaccinated against various other transmittable diseases, among them hepatitis A or B and typhoid fever.After vaccination 6 subjects had a relapse in the first month (3.3%), among those, 3 (1.6%) subjects within the first week, 1 (0.5%) during the third week and 2 (1.1%) during the fourth week. Within the second and third month after vaccination 6 (3.3%) and 5 (2.7%), respectively had relapses (Fig. 1).Figure 1Relapse-free follow-up after vaccination. Graph (Kaplan–Meier plot) shows the probability of relapse-free follow-up after vaccination. Each reduction represents the occurrence of a relapse episode over time in the studied population.Full size imageOver all, 14 relapses during day 7 and 90 following vaccination (7.6%) were reported. Between day 7 and 90 after vaccination relapses occurred in 9/125 (7.2%) patients after influenza, 4/75 (5.3%) after tetanus-based, and 1/20 (5.0%) after tic borne encephalitis vaccination, resulting in annualized relapse rates of 0.29, 0.21, and 0.2 respectively.In 8/106 (7.6%) patients treated with interferon-beta and in 3/52 (5.8%) patients treated with glatiramer acetate relapses occurred between day 7 and 90 after vaccination, resulting in annualized relapse rates of 0.30 and 0.23, respectively.The annualized relapse rate decreased from 0.69 to 0.45 during the 2 years before vaccination (p < 0.05). In the year following vaccination the annualized relapse rate (0.4) was not significantly changed (p > 0.05) compared to the preceding year (Fig. 2).Figure 2Annualised relapse rate. Mean annualised relapse rates in the study population during 2 years before vaccination and 1 year after vaccination, error bars show standard error of means.

Most of the reported adverse effects were mild and subsided within the first week. Except for local pain at the injection site that was rated as severe in one subject, all other local side effects were mild. Flu-like symptoms were the most commonly reported systemic side effects, of these 2 (13.3%) were severe, 7 (46.7%) were moderate and 6 (40.0%) mild (Table 2).Table 2 Side effects following vaccination.Full size tableFollowing influenza vaccination 12/125 (9.6%) had local and 13/125 (10.4%) had systemic adverse events, among them three patients had both, local and systemic side effects. In tetanus-based vaccine recipients 11/75 (14.7%) had local and 6/75 (8.0%) had systemic adverse events, among those, one patient had both, local and systemic adverse events. Following tick-borne vaccination 3/20 (15.0%) had local side effects, 2/20 (10.0%) had systemic reactions and one had both, local and systemic reactions.In patients treated with interferon-beta 14/106 (13.2%) had local and 12/106 (11.3%) had systemic adverse events, among them two patients had both, local and systemic side effects.In patients treated with glatiramer acetate 9/52 (17.3%) had local and 5/52 (9.6%) had systemic adverse events, among them three patients had both, local and systemic side effects.DiscussionThe fear of possible adverse effects of vaccination in general and specific to people with MS, like increased relapse activity and progression (EDSS), might occasionally lead to vaccine hesitancy in MS patients and their physicians7,13,14,15,16.The focus of this study was to analyse possible MS specific effects and other adverse events following vaccination. Since MS develops changes in long term, we have evaluated subjects with MS during one year before and after vaccination. This enables to determine changes in relapse-rate and EDSS and may provide a better insight into relapse timing and possible association to vaccination in a real-world situation.The analyzed real-world study population represents a cohort of out-patients with MS suitable for vaccination in a typical gender and age distribution17,18,19. The studied population had stable disease with annualised relapse rates of 0.69 and 0.45 during the 2 years before vaccination. Notably, the annualised relapse-rates were high in this study population before vaccination. This might reflect a selection bias towards people with MS and higher disease activity treated at the involved specialised MS clinics19,20,21. The reduction of the relapse reflects the effects of the established and ongoing DMT22,23,24. In the year following vaccination the annualized relapse rate (0.4) was not significantly changed compared to the time before vaccination. This implies, that routine vaccination does not negatively impact the annualized relapse rates in MS patients which has been shown in in previous studies as well25,26. One has to keep in mind that only inactivated, non-live vaccines have been used in our study. Other studies have hinted a possible increase in relapse rates after live vaccines, such as yellow fever13, though this was not confirmed in a recent study27.The EDSS, a marker of disease progression in MS that is rarely reported in the context of vaccination, showed a mild over-all increase during the study period of 3 years, corresponding to a MS cohort with mean disease duration of 8.5 years28,29. During 12 months after vaccination the EDSS did not significantly change in comparison to the EDSS at vaccination.Local and systemic adverse events of vaccination in the general population are extensively studied before licensing of vaccines and are generally assessed using subject diaries and short term follow-up visits in vaccination studies. This study did not focus on short-lived expected adverse events and thus did not use diaries, but relied on reporting of adverse events at close and structured follow-up visits. Therefore one may expect a reporting bias, since minor side effects may be underreported at retrospective documentation30,31. Nevertheless, the reported adverse events were rare and generally mild. Should severe cases of adverse events have occurred one may expect, that these events would have been reported despite a possible recall bias.On the one hand this prospective multicentre study shows that vaccine side effects in patients with MS do not present any particular quantitative or qualitative safety signals compared with the general population. On the other hand, the disease activity of MS is not negatively affected by non-live vaccines. This also seems true for novel mRNA-based SARS-CoV2 vaccines in patients with MS32,33,34,35,36, though long-term evaluations are pending14.We feel this study may contribute to overcome possible vaccine hesitancy in MS patients and their treating physicians37,38 by documenting low rates of adverse events following-routine vaccinations comparable to the expected spectrum of side effects in the general population.

But experts say there are ways to help keep students protected."Going back to school, there always is an increase in infections when kids are closely around each other and there can be clusters of infections," says Dr. Evelyn Chan, pediatrician and CEO of digital therapeutics company Smileyscope.Pharmacies across the U.S. are already contending with an industrywide shortage of the drug amoxicillin, an antibiotic that's commonly prescribed to treat a variety of childhood infections, including things like ear infections, strep throat and pneumonia. "There's lots of common conditions or diseases which are contagious, and the ones that we're thinking about at the moment (are) COVID, things like RSV have been quite high, as well as influenza," Chan says. "There's also the common things like vomiting and diarrhea ... and things like chickenpox and others as well."The best way to prevent these types of illnesses? Chan suggests three main principles: Stay healthy: Keep your immune system going strong by "eating nutritious food, getting enough physical activity and sleep," she says.Get vaccinated: "Encouraging all children and their families to stay up to date with their immunizations is incredibly important," she adds. "Go to your annual wellness checks to make sure that you're visiting the pediatrician and discussing what vaccinations they're eligible for and answering any questions."For example, there are some new options to protect against RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, an illness that typically causes cold-like symptoms but can sometimes be severe, especially for infants and older adults.Everyone age 6 months and older is also eligible for a new COVID shot this fall, when an updated vaccine formula will be available to add protection against recent variants. In terms of the flu, Dr. Céline Gounder, a CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, recently shared on "CBS Mornings" that September or October is a good time to get your shot.Practice prevention: "Teach kids ways to reduce infections," Chan says. "So, wash their hands frequently, sneeze into their elbow, wear masks where possible, stay at home if they have an illness so that they don't spread it to others."Dr. Carol Nwelue, a physician with Baylor Scott & White All Saints Medical Center, recently told CBS Texas that she also recommends telling kids not to share things like eating utensils and combs.How to prepare kids for vaccinationsKids can get quite anxious when it comes to needles, which is "totally normal," Chan says."Most children will be anxious and fearful about their vaccinations," she says. "Even half of teenagers and one in four adults are quite nervous about vaccinations. So I think it's really about setting the expectations and preparing well."She has three tips for making the vaccine process go smoothly:Inform: Chan suggests telling the child before an appointment that they will get a vaccination, so that they can be prepared. "Don't tell them too early so that they fret about it for days. But letting them know before they go to the doctor really kind of helps them prepare psychologically," she says.Coping skills: Figuring out some helpful coping tools and mechanisms with kids beforehand can help too."This might be bringing in their favorite toy, their favorite movie on their iPad, or thinking about something they can look forward to after that vaccination," she says, adding that medical teams are starting to use technology as a distraction tool as well.Chan's work, for example, uses virtual reality to create helpful distractions that reimagine those sensations patients may be scared about in a different way. "With Smileyscope, patients pop on a virtual reality headset at the doctor's office, and they go on an underwater adventure," she explains. "They get to feel waves washing over their arms when we clean with antiseptic. They look at fish and the fish come in and nibble at their arms — so that's when the shot happens."Because of the way the tool is choreographed to what's happening in the real world, patients actually are "very surprised when they come out of the VR experience and the shot is already done," she says.Keep things positive: Chan says to reinforce the idea that vaccines will help them be healthy and strong. "Keeping it in that positive light is a really important one as well," she adds. Back To School More Eye exams before school are critical, doctors say. Here's why.

(File Photo)Anna JoseUpdated on: 29 Aug 2023, 5:38 am2 min readCopiedKOCHI: India has been witnessing a spike in the number of flu cases during monsoon and winter every year. Though flu does not cause death or severe health issues directly, the seasonal disease can be severe in the elderly population and people with comorbidities. According to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), seasonal influenza is an acute respiratory infection caused by influenza viruses that circulate in all parts of the world.The World Health Organisation (WHO) and ICMR have recommended vaccination of high-risk groups with seasonal influenza vaccine. It is an important tool to prevent infection and severe outcomes caused by influenza viruses. The administration of flu vaccine, which is already available, can help prevent hospitalisation and reduce the risk of deaths caused by influenza.In India, the ministry of health and family welfare suggests the trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine. According to health experts, the vaccine is designed to protect against four different flu viruses - two influenza A viruses and two influenza B viruses. “The administration of flu shots should be mandatory for the elderly population. Flu shots do not prevent the occurrence of influenza. However, the severity of the disease and risk of death can be reduced,” said Dr Anitha Thilakan, associate professor at the Government Medical College, Thrissur, and vice-president of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) Kochi.Dr Sunny Orethel, former president of IMA, Kochi, said that flu shot shots should be mandatorily given to people above 65 years. “It is recommended for people with comorbidities as well. The immunity level of the human body will decrease as we get older. Also, if flu affects elderly people or people with other diseases, it can even cause death. Flu vaccines can reduce such risks.” He said that most of the deaths in India are due to pneumonia, the worst stage of flu, along with the presence of other diseases. “Flu shots can prevent such deaths,” he said.It is administered annually as there will be changes in the components of the vaccines according to mutations in the virus. “Genetic changes happen to the influenza virus. There will be changes in the components of the vaccine as well. It is preferred to take the flu shots annually,” said Dr Anitha. She said that the administration of flu vaccine has not been made compulsory in India. However, it can reduce risk factors.Follow The New Indian Express channel on WhatsApp Download the TNIE app to stay with us and follow the latestIndian Council of Medical ResearchinfluenzaShow CommentsRelated StoriesNo stories found.

(Mac Lai/Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry)Social SharingA provincial program that tracks the rise and fall of COVID-19 infections in Ontario communities through the monitoring of wastewater is expanding to include influenza, according to a lead investigator with the program at Western University. Ontario's COVID-19 wastewater surveillance program, run by a consortium of universities across the province, monitors sewage at 59 wastewater treatment plants in 34 different health units throughout the province in order to pinpoint where and when new waves of COVID-19 infections may emerge. Now the province is expanding the program to include influenza to get ahead of future outbreaks, especially as the fall chill returns, sending more people indoors and in turn, creating ideal conditions for viruses to circulate. "It's really useful for any respiratory virus, really, because we don't have good numbers on the number of people that are infected," said Chris DeGroot, the lead investigator for the project launched in response to the pandemic in 2021. "By looking to the wastewater, we kind of get a composite of everything that's going on among all the individuals in our community."The project sees samples taken from wastewater treatment plants tested in labs, using a method many might be familiar with in a post-pandemic world — a PCR test.The data collected from these tests has varied in its uses, from individuals using publicly available numbers to assess their risk levels, to informing choices surrounding vaccination."Public health is really using it just to be more informed. To get a better idea of when the respiratory virus season is starting, when they should really start to push their messaging to get vaccinated," said DeGroot.Wastewater testing suggests COVID on an upswing in LondonDeGroot says monitoring wastewater can even be useful in times like now, where there's less viral spread. This summer has been a rare occasion of generally low COVID-19 levels, but according to DeGroot, surges can happen any time, especially when seasons change and weather becomes cooler.Monitoring wastewater can also tell researchers more about our collective health."Any virus you can imagine. People have tested for polio, various STI's using different laboratory techniques," said DeGroot, adding he believes the possibilities are endless in terms of what can be measured in wastewater."You can look at consumption of drugs, either pharmaceutical or or illegal drugs. You can see what people are consuming."Michael Dan Siemon, wastewater research assistant, Faculty of Engineering, collecting a wastewater sample. (Mac Lai/Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry)Funding for the project won't last forever though, with a deadline of March 2024.DeGroot and his colleagues hope for an extension, but he says he doesn't believe it'll be necessary to ensure the project continues."We'll keep going for sure. You know we have other research grants and we're all very interested and committed to this work," he said."We just don't know if we can maintain the same scale that's possible with the with the government funding we received, but we'll definitely be continuing with wastewater surveillance for the foreseeable future."CBC's Journalistic Standards and Practices|About CBC NewsCorrections and clarifications|Submit a news tip|Report errorFooter LinksMy AccountProfileCBC GemNewslettersAbout CBC AccountsConnect with CBCFacebookXYouTubeInstagramMobileRSSPodcastsContact CBCSubmit FeedbackHelp CentreAudience Relations, CBC P.O.

BLACKPINK's Jisoo And Park Jung Min In Talks To Star In New Zombie Drama Drama Aug 31, 2023 by S Nam BLACKPINK’s Jisoo and Park Jung Min may be starring in a new drama together! On August 31, YTN reported that Park Jung Min and Jisoo will be starring in the new Coupang Play series “Influenza” (literal title). In response to the report, a source from Park Jung Min’s agency SEM Company shared, “It is one of the projects that he is reviewing to star in.” Jisoo’s agency YG Entertainment similarly responded, “She has received an offer for ‘Influenza’ and is reviewing the offer.” “Influenza” takes place in the backdrop of a high-rise air defense unit in Seoul, and the drama follows the story of soldier Jae Yoon and his girlfriend Young Joo—who was just notified of their breakup—as they run toward each other while struggling to face a crowd of zombies. The drama will be a collaboration of scriptwriter Han Ji Won behind “Parasite,” director Yoon Sung Hyun of “Bleak Night” and “Time to Hunt,” and writer Ji Ho Jin. Park Jung Min is reported to play the role of Jae Yoon who belatedly enlisted in the military at the age of 26 after trying to seek alternative service with a job in the defense industry. Due to his anxiety about the future, he obsesses over his girlfriend and ends up breaking up, and he eventually faces a world overcome by zombies. Although he was once weak and not confident, he gradually begins to play the role of a leader of a squad as they face off against the zombies. Jisoo will reportedly be taking on the role of Young Joo who is new to the workforce and waiting for her boyfriend to return from the military. While struggling due to Jae Yoon not understanding her feelings, she receives notice of their break up. She sets out to meet her boyfriend but discovers that zombies have taken over, and she gradually becomes a stronger figure while fighting to survive. Stay tuned for more updates on the drama!

However, in October last year, the incorporation of systematic vaccination in children between 6 months and 5 years of age was approved for the 2023-2024 season. The Andalucía region began inoculating children in this age group last year, as did Galicia and Murcia. This autumn, it will be extended to the whole of Spain, following the recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO) and other international bodies, which consider the flu vaccine to be the most effective way of preventing influenza and therefore advise that children aged 6 to 59 months, even if they are not at risk, should be considered a priority for vaccination against the infection. However, it is the parents who will have the final say and who decide whether or not to vaccinate their children. Reasons for widening the age group As detailed by the Ministry of Health in the report that endorses the recommendation to vaccinate children from six months of age against influenza, this infectious respiratory disease, caused by influenza viruses, causes a significant increase in hospitalisations (between 19-104 per 10,000 children), medical visits (between 6-15 per 100 children) and antibiotic consumption in the healthy child population (between 3-9 cycles of antibiotics per 100 children) every year. Although its lethality is minimal in children under 15 years of age, data confirms that 95% of those who die are under 5 years of age. In addition, children under this age have the second highest rates of hospitalisation and intensive care unit admission, and it is estimated that almost 50,000 confirmed cases of influenza per year in primary care, 4,000 hospitalisations - 800 severe - 250 ICU admissions and 8 in-hospital deaths occur in children under 5 years of age. In addition, the Ministry of Health has verified an excess of mortality attributable to influenza with an average of 28 deaths per season in children between 0 and 5 years of age. The most frequent complications of influenza in children are mainly respiratory, such as bronchial obstruction and pneumonia, and also acute otitis media, as well as other infrequent consequences, such as encephalitis or myocarditis, but which can be serious and leave after-effects. Influenza vaccines for children The vaccines available in Spain for children are the inactivated tetravalent vaccines Vaxigrip Tetra, Influvac Tetra, Fluarix Tetra (for infants from 6 months) and Flucelvax Tetra (for children from 2 years), and a live attenuated vaccine, Fluenz Tetra, which is administered intranasally (from 2 to 17 years). The formulations contain three or four types of influenza viruses (two type A and one or two type B). These viruses are selected on the basis of the likelihood of circulation each season, as estimated annually by the World Health Organization. According to the Health ministry, "flu vaccines are very safe" and adverse reactions are rare, including local reactions at the injection site (pain, redness and swelling), headache, muscle discomfort, fever or tiredness. Posology From 6 months to 8 years of age, it is recommended to administer two doses separated by at least 4 weeks, and only one jab if at least two doses of the vaccine have been received in previous campaigns. And from 9 years and older, a single dose.

All you want to know about symptoms and prevention. An acute viral illness with symptoms similar to Swine Flu, influenza, and adeno virus is spreading in Hyderabad, affecting either children or adults with comorbid conditions. The virus is yet to be identified and many people who are testing for Swine Flu, Covid-19, or Influenza are getting negative reports. Experts, however, say there is no cause of alarm as the recovery rate of this mystery illness is 100% and patients are taking 5 days to recover, which is a normal recovery time for a viral infection. The symptoms range from runny nose, sore throat, dry cough, fever with body pain and difficulty in breathing. (Also read: Explainer: Everything you need to know about Swine flu) The symptoms of this mystery virus start with a runny nose, followed by a sore throat, dry cough, fever with body pain and difficulty in breathing. (Pixabay) “We have been seeing an acute febrile viral illness for the past 6-8 weeks now and we have observed coryzal symptoms in these patients. This virus has been affecting 6-7 out of 100 people, and 50% of them are children. This is because the immunity of the children is not fully developed. The other 50% of patients are adults with comorbid lung diseases like COPD (also called smoker’s asthma), Post TB and Covid-destroyed lungs and asthma," says Dr Syed Abdul Aleem, Consultant - Pulmonology CARE Hospitals, Musheerabad, Hyderabad. Symptoms of the mystery virusThe symptoms of this mystery virus start with a runny nose, followed by a sore throat, dry cough, fever with body pain and difficulty in breathing. 1-2% of these patients have experienced respiratory failure. "The symptoms affect the upper respiratory tract and gradually affect the lower respiratory tract as well. We have been running tests for influenza A and B, swine flu – H1N1, avian flu – H3N2 and dengue as well. We observed false positive results in 3-4% of these tests because the structural similarity of the mystery virus is very similar to these virus families," says Dr Syed. Treatment"Fortunately, we are catching this early, and we are following symptomatic treatment where patients are responding well. We are treating patients with respiratory failure with Oseltamivir, an anti-viral drug and we are seeing good results. Along with treatment, we suggest maintaining hydration, and isolation as well until there is a complete recovery," says the expert PrecautionsThe precautions for this mystery virus are covering the nose and mouth while coughing or sneezing or using an N95 mask, keeping distance from people, sanitizing regularly, vaccinating against influenza and immediate isolation and approaching a healthcare professional for treatment. What could be this mystery virus?"This mystery virus may belong to the Adeno, Corona, Influenza or MERS family. So, we are suggesting a multiplex PCR panel of tests including Influenza A&B, H1N1, H3N2, and Covid RT-PCR," says Dr Syed. Catch every big hit,...

Official data shows that H3N2 infections account for 50% of all respiratory infections, followed by the Victoria group, RSV, and swine flu. TIMESOFINDIA.COMMedical experts are particularly concerned about the rise in RSV cases among the elderly. RSV cases had not been recorded in the past three years, prompting doctors to advocate for laboratory testing for a range of respiratory viruses to accurately diagnose infections.A quartet of respiratory viruses is responsible for a surge in illnesses that resemble common cold symptoms. While the threat of Covid-19 seems to be receding for now, other respiratory viruses, namely the novel human influenza virus (swine flu), H3N2, Victoria group, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), have taken the lead in the realm of infectious diseases, stated a TOI report.Official data on Influenza-Like Illness-Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (ILI-SARI) reveals that H3N2 infections account for a staggering 50 per cent of all respiratory infections. Following closely behind are the Victoria group, RSV, and swine flu. Interestingly, in the week ending August 27, no Covid-19 cases were detected in the samples tested, which is in stark contrast to the significant number of cases reported until May 7.Local medical experts attribute the surge in respiratory illnesses to this troublesome quartet and express particular concern over the rise in RSV cases among the elderly, a problem further complicated by the recent increase in cases during the monsoon season.RSV, a respiratory virus with symptoms resembling those of a common cold or influenza, initially emerged between February 20-26 this year, peaking in March 20-26. After a brief respite, RSV resurfaced as a significant concern starting from July 24. It now ranks as the third most prevalent infection trigger.What's noteworthy is that RSV cases had not been recorded in the past three years, prompting city doctors to advocate for laboratory testing for a range of respiratory viruses, extending beyond Covid-19, H3N2, or swine flu, to accurately diagnose infections. The Indian Council of Medical Research's (ICMR) ILI-SARI data since 2021 indicates that different virus types have dominated the infection scenario at different times.FinanceFinancial Literacy for Non-Finance ExecutivesBy - CA Raja, Chartered Accountant | Financial Management Educator | Former AVP - Credit, SBIView Program MarketingDigital Marketing Masterclass by Neil PatelBy - Neil Patel, Co-Founder and Author at Neil Patel Digital Digital Marketing GuruView Program MarketingPerformance Marketing for eCommerce BrandsBy - Zafer Mukeri, Founder- Inara MarketersView Program Web DevelopmentIntermediate C++ Skills: Master Pointers, Structures and File StreamBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView Program Artificial Intelligence(AI)AI for Everyone: Understanding and Applying the Basics on Artificial IntelligenceBy - Ritesh Vajariya, Generative AI ExpertView Program MarketingModern Marketing Masterclass by Seth GodinBy - Seth Godin, Former dot com Business Executive and Best Selling AuthorView Program Data ScienceMySQL for Beginners: Learn Data Science and Analytics SkillsBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView Program FinanceFinancial Literacy i.e Lets Crack the Billionaire CodeBy - CA Rahul Gupta, CA with 10+ years of experience and Accounting EducatorView Program Artificial Intelligence(AI)Master in Python Language Quickly Using the ChatGPT Open AIBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView Program Office ProductivityAdvanced Excel Course - Financial Calculations & Excel Made EasyBy - Anirudh Saraf, Founder- Saraf A & Associates, Chartered AccountantView Program Office ProductivityZero to Hero in Microsoft Excel: Complete Excel guide 2024By - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView Program Artificial Intelligence(AI)Mastering C++ Fundamentals with Generative AI: A Hands-OnBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView Program Web DevelopmentA Comprehensive ASP.NET Core MVC 6 Project Guide for 2024By - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView Program FinanceA2Z Of MoneyBy - elearnmarkets, Financial Education by StockEdgeView Program FinanceA2Z Of Finance: Finance Beginner CourseBy - elearnmarkets, Financial Education by StockEdgeView Program Artificial Intelligence(AI)ChatGPT Mastery from Zero to Hero: The Complete AI CourseBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView Program Artificial Intelligence(AI)AI and Analytics based Business StrategyBy - Tanusree De, Managing Director- Accenture Technology Lead, Trustworthy AI Center of Excellence: ATCIView Program Web DevelopmentIntermediate Java Mastery: Method, Collections, and BeyondBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView Program Web DevelopmentJava 21 Essentials for Beginners: Build Strong Programming FoundationsBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView Program Office ProductivityMastering Google Sheets: Unleash the Power of Excel and Advance AnalysisBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView Program MarketingDigital Marketing Masterclass by Pam MooreBy - Pam Moore, Digital Transformation and Social Media ExpertView Program Artificial Intelligence(AI)Tabnine AI Masterclass: Optimize Your Coding EfficiencyBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView Program Dr. Suneetha Nareddy, senior consultant in infectious diseases at Apollo Hospitals in Jubilee Hills, told TOI, "Currently, we are seeing several common viruses that cause ILI, including influenza (H3N2, Victoria), Covid-19, RSV, and metapneumovirus." She noted that RSV spreads easily from person to person through saliva or mucus.Dr. Viswesvaran Balasubramanian, consultant in interventional pulmonology and sleep medicine at Yashoda Hospitals, pointed out that RSV infections are well-documented in young children (0-5 years) compared to children from other age groups. "Typical upper respiratory tract symptoms like nasal congestion, runny nose, cough, and low-grade fever are common," he added.Dr. Vijay Kumar Chennamchetty, lead interventional pulmonologist and sleep disorder specialist at Apollo Hospitals, emphasized that RSV has been on the rise in people with comorbid illnesses such as diabetes, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and other immunocompromised individuals.Dr. Vamsi Krishna Mutnuri, consultant interventional pulmonologist at Yashoda Hospitals, noted a steep increase in viral infections. He stated, "Symptoms are very similar to flu, consisting of cold, cough, fever, body pains, and malaise. Many of these patients are testing negative for H1N1, Covid-19, and dengue."(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)Read More News onrespiratory illnessapollo hospitalscovid 19swine fluh3n2victoria grouprsv(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

So, you might be wondering why this one is worth mentioning. Experts haven’t really been able to identify this virus, and it seems to be dodging all standard tests!Government hospitals across the Telangana capital have seen an uptick in outpatients with influenza-like symptoms. In fact, the footfall has increased from 250-300 to 600 at a state-run Fever Hospital within a fortnight, the Times of India reported.Dr M Raja Rao, superintendent of Gandhi Hospital, told the news agency that they had been witnessing cases of acute respiratory illnesses for the last two to three months. And while influenza-like illnesses showing symptoms like breathing difficulty and low oxygen saturation typically tested positive either for swine flu or COVID-19, this particular virus showed negative results for both.But the good news is that there seems to be a drop in influenza-like illnesses (ILI) compared to the previous years.AdvertisementDespite there being some snags in the diagnosis of this virus, experts ascertain that there is no cause for alarm just yet. According to Dr P Shankar, director of the Institute of Preventive Medicine, the recovery rate in all these cases has been 100% until now, as well. Further, the recovery period doesn’t typically exceed five days, provided symptomatic treatment is given to the patients. However, individuals with comorbidities must exercise caution as severe disease might require hospitalisation.As for whether this virus is going to cause any more trouble, experts think that the ongoing temperature fluctuations caused by the changing weather will create negative conditions for these viruses to survive. Meanwhile, swine flu and COVID-19 cases also seem to be under control. This has been attributed to the relatively high vaccination rates and the endemic nature of both diseases.**For weather, science, space, and COVID-19 updates on the go, download The Weather Channel App (on Android and iOS store).

Infectious diseases expert Dr V Ramasubramanian in an interview to Pushpa Narayan explains why people should take the flu shot Dr V Ramasubramanian Itâs the beginning of the flu season and hospitals in the city have reported an increase in the number of people coming in with fever, severe body pain, and fatigue. Infectious diseases expert Dr V Ramasubramanian in an interview to Pushpa Narayan explains why people should take the flu shot. Will the flu vaccine prevent the flu?The flu vaccine prevents the infection in up to 70% of cases, and reduces the chances of severe disease.The infection can stimulate inflammation of different parts of the body including blood vessels. This leads to a series of complications in the body including heart attacks and strokes. Numerous studies have shown that annual flu shots reduce the risk of hospitaliza tion and death, particularly among children, pregnant women, the elderly, and people with comorbid conditions such as diabetes and hypertension. While we reco mmend annual flu vaccination for all, we insist on it for healthcare workers and people at risk.Why is this vaccination annual?The immune response to flu weakens after s ix months. The annual vaccination boosts immunity. Additionally, influenza viruses are constantly changing. So, a vaccine from the previous flu season may not protect you through the upcoming flu season and the degree of protection also varies with the kind of vaccine. Vaccine manufacturers use a variety of genetic, e pidemiological, and antibody data besides informa tion from sero-studies to determine the strain the vaccine will contain for the year. There is one vaccine for the northern hemisphere, which is ready for use by mid-August, and there is another one for the southern hemisphere, which is ready by February.ï® Is there a particular month when people should take the vaccine?In the West, flu is seasonal and occurs in winter. In tropical countries like India flu occurs throughout the year. So, the vaccine is recommended ahead of the monsoon â a season when the flu peaks. It can be different for different parts of India. For instance, people from Kerala and Maharashtra will be advised to take the southern hemisp here vaccine by June. People from Chennai take the northern hemisphere vaccine in August -September. However, if the specific vaccine is not available, we tell them to take the one that is available.Have cases of influenza gone up in Chennai?In Chennai, we are seeing a spike in flu cases now. People report severe joint and muscle pain, fever and other symptoms of the flu. Several people with comorbid conditions are also being admitted to ICUs for strokes and heart attacks. Is there anything people should take along with the flu vaccine?Itâs difficult to catch adults for vaccination. So, when seniors come for their annual flu shots we check if they are vaccinated against DPT, pneumonia, and shingles. Who should not take the vaccine? Will there be reactions to the vaccine?Flu shots are recommended for people above six months. However, it is best to consult the doctor about which flu shot to take. The flu shot is made with an inactivated virus, which means people canât develop the flu from the seasonal flu vaccine. Some people may have redness, swelling, or soreness at the injection site or a low-grade fever.End of ArticleFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA Visual Stories Previous9 most unique and rare birds in the worldLifestyle10 foods that contain highest protein per 100 gramsLifestyle8 Indian cities where non-vegetarian food is bannedFoodHow to make South-Indian style Chicken PakoraFood10 lines from Shakespeare's sonnets that are profound life lessonsLifestyleMost beautiful hill stations in the Western Ghats for a serene vacationtravel8 yoga poses that can reduce waist size effectivelyLifestyle7 home remedies to remove yellow stains from teethLifestyle10 books that will help transform your life in the next 3 monthsLifestyleGanesh Chaturthi 2024: 10 South Indian dishes to make for Lord GaneshaFood Next123Hot PicksHarris Trump Debate HighlightsWhat is Project 2025?PM Modi Noida VisitWho is Ilhan Omar9/11 Remembrance DayCentral Park 5 Case ExplainedGod of Chaos AsteroidTOP TRENDINGSanjauli Mosque RowWho is Donald HarrisTaylor Swift Endorses Kamala HarrisMaldives President Mohamed MuizzuApple iPhone 16WWE Wrestlers who Married other WrestlersJasprit BumrahPM Narendra ModiNagpur Audi CrashDell LayoffsTrending StoriesIn CityEntire WebsiteMalaika Arora's father Anil Arora dies by suicide in Mumbai7 Key Reasons Why UPSC is the Toughest Exam in India9/11 Remembrance Day: Key moments from the deadliest attack on USHoward University: 10 landmark firsts of the institution that shaped Kamala HarrisEarthquake of magnitude 5.8 strikes Pakistan, tremors felt in Delhi, neighbouring areasWho were Barack Obama's challengers in 2008 and 2012 US presidential elections?'A in INDIA alliance': Rahul Gandhi's slip-up during address to Indian-Americans goes viralTrump vs Harris: Betting markets reveal whoâs expected to win the US presidential debateIGNOU December 2024 Term-End Exam: Registration Details, Important Dates, and Fee StructureTop 10 TED Talks to Boost Confidence and Success for Female Students'They would be in jail if ...': Kharge's attack draws BJP's 'Emergency' retortAfter Kolkata docs set new demands, Mamata govt says 'not ready to accept'Is this Indiaâs chance to replace Bangladesh as worldâs clothing factory?Ayushman Bharat scheme to be expanded to cover elderly above 70Watch: PM Modi participates in Ganpati Puja at CJI's houseThe Multan Mystery: When Dravid left Tendulkar stranded at 194*Why is Kolkata rape-murder victimâs mother accusing Mamata of lying?iPhone 16 series launched: Complete features, price and how to pre-orderHarris emerges unscathed from debate, dancing around her flip-flops'On basis of fairness, equality': Yunus says B'desh seeks good ties with IndiaAbout usCreate Your Own AdTerms of Use and Grievance Redressal Policy Privacy policyAdvertise with usRSSNewsletterFeedbackePaperSitemapArchivesFOLLOW US ONOther Times Group News SitesThe Economic TimesHindi Economic TimesNavbharat TimesMaharashtra TimesVijaya KarnatakaTelugu SamayamTamil SamayamMalayalam SamayamI am GujaratTimesPointsIndiatimesBrand CapitalEducation TimesTimes FoodMumbai MirrorBangalore MirrorMX PlayerHindi PodcastPopular CategoriesHeadlinesSports NewsBusiness NewsIndia NewsWorld NewsBollywood NewsHealth+ TipsIndian TV ShowsCelebrity PhotosTechnology NewsHot on the WebPsychology TestMalaika Arora Father Death News Live UpdateStree 2 CollectionOptical illusionWeight GainGinger Side EffictsKanjeevaram SariNasaSister ShivaniRemo D'SouzaTop TrendsWorld Richest NFL PlayerAyushman Bharat Insurance SchemeKing CharlesTyphoon YagiHaitian ImmigrantsVinesh PhogatTech LayoffsHamster Kombat Daily Cipher CodeIGNOU Exam RegistrationDonald TrumpPrince HarryGurpatwant PannunTaylor SwiftIlhan OmarKamala HarrisElon MuskLive Cricket ScoreTrending TopicsDeepika PadukoneMalaika Arora Father DeathArbaaz KhanJayram RaviAishwarya Rai BachchanSlat WaterWeight GainGOAT CollectionVikas Sethi DeathMalayalam ProducersIndia's Best Dancer 4Simi GarewalDilli BabuIndian National ParksLaung BenefitsVikas SethiiPhone 16Dubai Princess Sheikha MahraMG Windsor EvWordle AnswerLiving and entertainmentETimesTravel DestinationsCricbuzz.comTVLifestyleNewspaper SubscriptionFood NewsTimes PrimeWhats HotServicesCouponDuniaTechGigTimesJobsBollywood NewsTimes MobileGadgetsCareersColombiaLatest NewsManju Warrier expresses gratitude for birthday wishes: "Forever humbled and grateful"Jiiva and wife escape with minor injuries after a road accidentWhy Banyan trees survive for centuries and spread indefinitely?Telangana government pushes for increased flood relief from CentreShilpa Shetty and Raj Kundra spotted at the Siddhivinayak Temple; video insideNBA 2K25 locker codes September 2024: Locker codes revealed and know how to reveal themDonald Trump and Kamala Harris shake hands as they meet for first time on debate stage: Watch the 'awkward' momentBRS pushes for disqualification of turncoat MLAs after High Court rulingKamala may have won debate.

Secretary of the IPA's Tehran branch Mohammad Amin Qobadi emphasized on Wednesday that the Iranian pharmacists succeeded in developing the vaccine through the use of innovative technology along with the collaboration of the biotechnology industry elite. The domestically-developed four-valent vaccine successfully passed all clinical trials years ago, Qobadi said, adding that the vaccine has got the approval of Iran’s Ministry of Health and Medical Education, as well as various physicians. This is the third year of production and consumption of the recombinant influenza vaccine in Iran, he noted. According to this member of the Iranian Association of Manufacturers and Exporters of Medical Biotech, the influenza vaccines developed in other countries are being produced based on eggs, and they cost five dollars, but the recombinant influenza vaccine is sold for 65 dollars throughout the world. Iranian specialists supply the $65 vaccine for less than $5, Qobadi said, calling for support for domestically developed vaccines by consumer associations. 4208**2050 Iran Society 1 Persons Tags recombinant influenza vaccine Iran Your Comment You are replying to: . × Cancel Reply Name Email Your Comment * Send Latest News Red Cross now on Zionist regime’s target after UNRWA 2024-11-12 05:42 Yemeni official raps Arab countries’ inaction on Zionist crimes 2024-11-12 05:42 Gaza on brink of famine, says Norwegian minister 2024-11-12 04:33 Dutch police continue cracking down on pro-Palestine protesters 2024-11-12 03:43 West Asia region must ensure its own security: Advisor to UAE pres. 2024-11-12 03:00 Gharibabadi assesses summit of Arab and Islamic nations in Riyadh 2024-11-12 01:59 Iran, Iraq vow to expand security ties 2024-11-12 00:04 OIC meeting final statement stresses centrality of Palestinian issue, warns against violation of Iran's sovereignty 2024-11-11 22:26 Iran's VP meets with Saudi Crown Prince 2024-11-11 21:24 Iran urges ‘collective action’ from Muslim nations to stop Israel 2024-11-11 20:17 ADVERTISEMENT Desktop version Mobile version Powered by Nastooh Powered by NastoohBLACKPINK's Jisoo to star in zombie K-Drama Influenza?

However, people in several parts of the country such as Hyderabad, Bengaluru are witnessing a spurt in other respiratory infections that mimic common cold. As per reports, the top respiratory viruses causing these infections include human influenza virus (swine flu), H3N2, Victoria group and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).

Symptoms include nasal secretions, chills, fever, decreased appetite, and in some cases, lower respiratory tract disease.3/6​H3N2​H3N2 flu spreads through droplet infections like COVID-19 and other seasonal flu. You can develop the infection when you come in close contact with an infected person. One can also get infected by coming in contact with an infected surface and touching their face, eyes or mouth immediately after. Symptoms of H3N2 flu include runny or stuffy nose, sore throat with cough, headache, fever, chills, body ache, fatigue, diarrhea, and vomiting.4/6​Victoria group​Seasonal influenza is an acute respiratory infection caused by influenza viruses. There are 4 types of influenza viruses, types A, B, C and D. Victoria lineage belongs to Influenza B viruses, which can only pass from human to human.

Wash them thoroughly with soap for at least 20 seconds and then rinse them under running water.

They believe this may be due to an unidentified respiratory virus that they are currently studying. HYDERABAD: At a time when neighbouring states like Maharashtra and Karnataka have sounded an alarm over the increasing number of swine flu cases, back home in Hyderabad the numbers are limited to a handful, say doctors.However, what they are intrigued by is the steady influx of acute respiratory illness that carry typical symptoms of swine flu but are testing negative for the virus.Top Picks For YouâUnderstanding lungâs defenders can help fight respiratory virusesâRespiratory infections among kids up post-dengue: DoctorsIn fact, they are testing negative even for Covid-19.Doctors say this is likely due to the advent of an unidentified respiratory virus, which they are studying at the moment.They are being tested at Gandhi Hospital, Fever Hospital and the Institute of Preventive Medicine (IPM) for swine flu, Covid-19, influenza A and influenza B viruses."We have been witnessing this pattern for the last two to three months. There have been many cases of acute respiratory illnesses which have tested negative for coronavirus, swine flu and influenza. Generally, influenza-like illnesses that show symptoms like breathing difficulty and low oxygen saturation are expected to test positive either for swine flu or Covid-19, but that's not the case here," said Dr M Raja Rao, superintendent, Gandhi Hospital, adding that these could be some other respiratory virus.Dr P Shankar, director of the Institute of Preventive Medicine, shared a similar experience. He, however, maintained that there is no reason for alarm just yet. "The recovery rate in all these cases has been 100% until now. And the recovery is happening within five days of symptomatic treatment. Moreover, the temperature fluctuations create negative conditions for the viruses to survive and hence we do not expect a surge in any of these cases. Few cases of swine flu as well as Covid-19 are there due to the endemic nature of the viruses, but even then the situation is not worrying," he added.According to experts, there are over 200 respiratory viruses that affect humans, most common of them being influenza viruses, rhinovirus, enterovirus, coronaviruses including SARS and MERS, respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza virus.These are mild in form and are not tested currently, as they are self-limiting to five to seven days.Low numbers because of poor testing?While sources said that a few swine flu cases are still being reported from government and private hospitals, the state health authorities claimed otherwise. According to them, swine cases so far this year have been less than 50 (256 cases of swine flu were reported last year). "We see swine flu cases from time to time but not everybody is getting tested. Many people who have had symptoms are taking paracetamol tablets and recovering within three days. Hence they do not even turn up for testing. They could be affected by the virus but overall confirmed cases are very few," said a health official.End of ArticleFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA Visual Stories Previous10 ingredients used for making healthy dumplingsFood10 steps to start the most beautiful rose garden at homeLifestyleTop 10 must-try jungle safaris in IndiatravelWorld Rhino Day: 10 things to know about rhino conservation efforts in IndiatravelHow to make the perfect Masala Omelette at homeFoodWorld Tourism Day: 10 most peaceful countries in the worldtravel8 natural sources of Vitamin B12Lifestyle8 things that make us happy from withinLifestyleHow to make Palak Patta ChaatFoodâ10 jaw-dropping animals with incredible bite strengthâLifestyle Next123 Photostories Top 5 Indian states with the highest per capita income5 traditional Indian hair oils for hair growth5 signs you are unknowingly being toxic to yourself, as per psychologyZodiac Signs Who Have Good Sixth Senseâ5 signs you are being manipulated in a relationshipâ5 Sanskrit phrases that work as excellent motivations and affirmationsMen with low self-esteem show these weird signs in relationships5 easy exercises that improve liver health within a monthFrom Mr Faisu to Jannat Zubair, Vishal Pandey and others: Bigg Boss OTT 3 fame Adnaan Shaikh and Ayeshaâs dreamy wedding and reception ceremony10 countries with the largest air forces in the world5 ancient cities once considered myths that actually exist!5 signs you are intelligent yet unknowingly doubt yourself, as per psychology123Hot PicksMumbai Rain LiveNandini Ghee Tirupati LadduEric AdamsDelhi Winter Action PlanEY Pune Employee DeathBengaluru Water ShortageMusk dating Meloni?TOP TRENDINGCaleb WilliamsChess Olympiad 2024WWE Tallest WrestlersKamindu MendisIPL Player RetentionSarco MachineMr McMahon Netflix DocuseriesVladimir PutinShane McMahonBengaluru Mahalakshmi MurderTrending StoriesIn CityEntire WebsiteWoman claims husband bought private island so she could wear bikini, faces backlash5 Reasons why Triple H is controlling WWE better than Vince McMahon'Diddy List': Names of celebrities connected to Sean Combs viralWhy Earth will have two moons from September 29 to November 25Charles did not like Diana's surprise Billy Joel dance, 'it was early sign of doomed marriage'Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut convicted in defamation case filed by BJP leader Kirit Somaiya's wife8 high-paying freelance jobs you can start todayRs 4.8 crore plot for Maharashtra BJP chief Chandrashekhar Bawankuleâs trust Shri Mahalakshmi Jagdamba Sansthan stirs row96 million views!

Jisoo is entertaining in clips I have seen on YT, I think comedy roles or a homebody character that some viewers can relate to would suit her. To me her SD acting felt like she was reading the script while also thinking about her actions… it wasn’t natural and the other actors (senior and rookie) made it more obvious for me that she is lacking. She can get better she just might need to find roles that suit her.
