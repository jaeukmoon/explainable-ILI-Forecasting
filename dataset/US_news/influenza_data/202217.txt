Saving Lives, Protecting People Search Submit Emergency Preparedness and Response Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza A(H5N1) Virus: Recommendations for Human Health Investigations and Response Print Minus Related Pages Distributed via the CDC Health Alert Network Friday, April 29, 2022, 8:00 PM ET CDCHAN-00464 Summary A person has tested positive for avian influenza A(H5) virus (H5 bird flu) in the U.S., as confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and reported by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment on April 28, 2022. This case occurred in a person who had direct exposure to poultry and who was involved in the culling (depopulating) of poultry with presumptive H5N1 bird flu. Starting in January, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) detected highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) virus in wild birds in the United States followed by multiple detections in U.S. commercial poultry and backyard bird flocks [1,2]. Detection of A(H5) virus in one person who was involved in culling of poultry does not change the human health risk assessment, which remains low for the general public. People with work or recreational exposures to infected birds are at greater risk of infection and should follow recommended precautions. The purpose of this HAN Health Advisory is to notify public health workers, clinicians, and the public of the potential for human infection with this virus and to describe the CDC’s recommendations for patient investigation and testing, infection control including the use of personal protective equipment, and antiviral treatment and prophylaxis. Background During January 13, 2022, through April 27, 2022, USDA APHIS reported more than 899 detections of wild birds infected with HPAI A(H5N1) virus in 33 states [1]. On February 9, 2022, USDA APHIS confirmed the first outbreak of HPAI A(H5N1) virus in a commercial turkey flock in Indiana [2]. Since then, APHIS has identified 247 HPAI A(H5N1) outbreaks among commercial poultry or backyard bird flocks in 29 states involving more than 35 million birds. On April 20, 2022, an adult in Colorado developed fatigue following exposure to presumptive H5N1 virus-infected poultry while participating in poultry depopulation activities during April 18-22, 2022. The individual, who does not have any known chronic medical conditions, reported wearing recommended personal protective equipment although compliance with recommended eye protection was unclear. An upper respiratory tract specimen was collected from the individual on April 20, 2022. The specimen arrived at and was tested at the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment Laboratory Services on April 25, 2022; reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis indicated it was positive for influenza A virus but negative for contemporary seasonal human H1pdm09 and H3 influenza A virus subtypes. The specimen was forwarded to the Influenza Division of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for further testing, was received at CDC on April 27, 2022, and confirmed as influenza A(H5) virus using RT-PCR the same day. The A(H5)-positive individual did not report any other symptoms and their fatigue resolved after 3 days; the individual returned to their baseline health. The individual remains asymptomatic in isolation on oseltamivir treatment. A second respiratory specimen from the same patient was collected on April 26, 2022, and tested negative for influenza viruses on April 27, 2022, by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment Laboratory Services. Whether the detection of H5 virus in the original respiratory specimen is a result of transient surface contamination of the individual’s nasal passages or represents infection, cannot be determined at this point. Public Health Authorities are pursuing the appropriate public health response and are assuming this is an infection and taking actions to contain and treat. Specimens from close contacts of the A(H5)-positive individual and persons who participated in depopulation activities at the same facility were collected on April 20, 2022, and tested negative for influenza viruses. These individuals are being monitored for symptoms and additional respiratory specimens are being obtained and re-tested for influenza viruses. All individuals who were exposed to poultry at this facility are being monitored for symptoms for 10 days and will be tested if symptomatic in accordance with CDC and USDA guidance. Ancestors of HPAI A(H5N1) viruses first emerged in southern China and led to large poultry outbreaks in Hong Kong in 1997, which resulted in 18 human infections. These poultry outbreaks were controlled, but HPAI A(H5N1) viruses were not eradicated in birds, and the virus reassorted and reemerged in 2003 to spread widely in birds throughout Asia, and later in Africa, Europe, and the Middle East, causing sporadic human infections. HPAI A(H5) viruses were detected in North America from 2014 to 2016 where they caused widespread poultry outbreaks and detections among wild birds in Canada and the United States. Since 2003, 19 countries have reported 864 human infections and 456 deaths with HPAI A(H5N1) virus to the World Health Organization (WHO) as of March 1, 2022 [3]. However, contemporary HPAI A(H5) viruses circulating globally and causing outbreaks in U.S. wild birds and poultry are different from earlier HPAI A(H5N1) viruses. Prior to the human case of A(H5) virus in the United States reported here, the only other human infection with this HPAI A(H5N1) virus was an asymptomatic case reported in the United Kingdom in January 2022 in association with exposure to domestically kept infected ducks. The case reported by Colorado is the first human detection of any influenza A(H5) virus in the United States. At this time, there is no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission of HPAI A(H5N1) virus in the U.S. Influenza A viruses infect the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts of birds causing birds to shed the virus in their saliva, mucous, and feces. Human infections with avian influenza A viruses can happen when enough virus gets into a person’s eyes, nose, or mouth or is inhaled. People with close or prolonged unprotected contact with infected birds or contaminated environments are at greater risk of infection. Illnesses in humans from avian influenza A virus infections have ranged from mild (e.g., eye infection, upper respiratory symptoms) to severe illness (e.g., pneumonia) resulting in death. The spread of avian influenza A viruses from one infected person to another has been reported in other countries, but is very rare, and when it has happened, it has not led to sustained spread among people. At this time, CDC considers the human health risk to the U.S. public from these newly identified HPAI A(H5N1) viruses to be low; however, people with close or prolonged, unprotected contact with infected birds or contaminated environments are at greater risk of infection. While there is little information about the spectrum of illness that could result from human infections with current H5N1 bird flu viruses, currently, CDC considers this virus as having the potential to cause severe disease in humans and recommends the following: Recommendations for Clinicians Clinicians should consider the possibility of HPAI A(H5N1) virus infection in persons showing signs or symptoms of respiratory illness who have relevant exposure history. This includes persons who have had contact with potentially infected birds (e.g., handling, slaughtering, defeathering, butchering, culling, preparation for consumption); direct contact with water or surfaces contaminated with feces or parts (carcasses, internal organs, etc.) of potentially infected birds; and persons who have had prolonged exposure to potentially infected birds in a confined space. Clinicians should contact the state public health department to arrange testing for influenza A(H5N1) virus, collect respiratory specimens using personal protective equipment (PPE), consider starting empiric antiviral treatment (see below), and encourage the patient to isolate at home away from their household members and not go to work or school until it is determined they do not have avian influenza A virus infection. Testing for other potential causes of acute respiratory illness should also be considered depending upon the local epidemiology of circulating respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. Recommendations for State Health Departments State health departments should investigate potential human cases of HPAI A(H5N1) virus infection as described below and should notify CDC within 24 hours of identifying a case under investigation. Rapid detection and characterization of novel influenza A viruses in humans remain critical components of national efforts to prevent further cases, to allow for evaluation of clinical illness associated with them, and to assess the ability of these viruses to spread from human to human. Recommendations for Surveillance and Testing People exposed to HPAI A(H5N1)-infected birds (including people wearing recommended PPE) should be monitored for signs and symptoms of influenza beginning after their first exposure and for 10 days after their last exposure. Patients who meet Epidemiologic criteria AND either Clinical OR Public Health Response criteria below should be tested for HPAI A(H5N1) virus infection by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay using H5-specific primers and probes at your state or local public health department. Epidemiological Criteria Persons with recent exposure (within 10 days) to HPAI A(H5N1) virus through one of the following: Exposure to HPAI A(H5N1) virus infected birds defined as follows: Close exposure (within six feet) to birds, with confirmed avian influenza A virus infection by A(H5N1) virus. Bird exposures can include, but are not limited to handling, slaughtering, defeathering, butchering, culling, or preparing birds for consumption, OR Direct contact with surfaces contaminated with feces or bird parts (e.g., carcasses, internal organs) from infected birds, OR Visiting a live poultry market with confirmed bird infections or associated with a case of human infection with HPAI A(H5N1). Exposure to an infected person – Close (within six feet) unprotected (without use of respiratory and eye protection) exposure to a person who is a confirmed, probable, or symptomatic suspected case of human infection with HPAI A(H5N1) (e.g., in a household or healthcare facility). Laboratory exposure (unprotected exposure to HPAI A(H5N1) virus in a laboratory) Clinical Criteria Persons with signs and symptoms consistent with acute or lower respiratory tract infection, or with conjunctivitis, or complications of acute respiratory illness without an identified cause. Examples include but are not limited to: Mild illness (e.g., cough, sore throat, fever or feeling feverish, rhinorrhea, fatigue, myalgia, arthralgia, headache) or conjunctivitis (red eye, discharge from eye) Moderate to severe illness: (e.g., shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, altered mental status, seizures) Complications: pneumonia, respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, multi-organ failure, meningoencephalitis Public Health Response Criteria Asymptomatic persons whom public health authorities, in consultation with CDC,determine need to be tested to assess the clinical spectrum of infection with HPAI A(H5N1) virus as part of public health investigations. Preferred Respiratory Specimens For persons with suspected HPAI A(H5N1) virus infection, the following specimens should be collected as soon as possible after illness onset or when deemed necessary: a nasopharyngeal swab and a nasal aspirate or wash, or two swabs combined into one viral transport media vial (e.g., a nasal or nasopharyngeal swab combined with an oropharyngeal swab).If these specimens cannot be collected, a single nasal or oropharyngeal swab is acceptable. Patients with severe respiratory disease also should have lower respiratory tract specimens (e.g., an endotracheal aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid) collected, if possible. For severely ill persons, multiple respiratory tract specimens from different sites should be obtained to increase the potential for HPAI A(H5N1) virus detection. Recommendations for the Public People should avoid unprotected exposure to sick or dead birds, bird feces, litter, or materials contaminated by birds with suspected or confirmed HPAI A(H5N1) virus infection. Personal protective equipment (PPE) includes a properly fitted unvented or indirectly vented safety goggles, disposable gloves, boots or boot covers, a NIOSH-approved respirator (e.g., N95), disposable fluid-resistant coveralls, and disposable head cover or hair cover. PPE should be worn when in direct or close contact (within about six feet) with sick or dead poultry, poultry feces, litter, or materials potentially contaminated with HPAI A(H5N1) virus. People exposed to HPAI A(H5N1)-virus infected birds (including people wearing recommended PPE) should monitor for signs and symptoms of influenza beginning after their first exposure and for 10 days after their last exposure. Influenza antiviral prophylaxis may be considered to prevent infection, particularly in those who had unprotected exposure to HPAI A(H5N1)-virus infected birds (see below). Persons who develop respiratory illness after exposure to HPAI A(H5N1) virus infected birds should seek prompt medical evaluation for influenza testing and antiviral treatment by their clinician or public health department. Symptomatic persons should isolate away from household members and others except for seeking medical evaluation. Recommendations for Flock Owners and Worker Protection To reduce risk of HPAI A(H5N1) virus infection, backyard bird flock owners, poultry workers and responders should avoid unprotected direct physical contact with sick or dead birds, carcasses, feces, or litter from potentially infected poultry. Poultry workers should wear recommended PPE when in direct contact with sick or dead birds, carcasses, feces, or litter from potentially infected poultry, and when going into any buildings with sick or dead poultry, carcasses, feces, or litter from potentially infected poultry. Workers should receive training on and demonstrate an understanding of when to use PPE; what PPE is necessary; how to properly put on, use, take off, dispose of, and maintain PPE; and PPE limitations. Backyard bird flock owners should take similar precautions using commercially available N95 respirators, eye protection, and gloves, and perform thorough hand washing after contact. Recommendations for Infection Control Standard, contact, and airborne precautions are recommended for patients presenting for medical care or evaluation who have illness consistent with influenza and recent exposure to potentially infected birds. For additional guidance on infection control precautions for patients who might be infected with HPAI A(H5N1) virus, please refer to guidance for infections with novel influenza A viruses associated with severe disease. Recommendations for Influenza Antiviral Treatment and Chemoprophylaxis Chemoprophylaxis of Persons with Bird Exposure: Chemoprophylaxis with influenza antiviral medications can be considered for any person meeting exposure criteria. Decisions to initiate post-exposure antiviral chemoprophylaxis should be based on clinical judgment, with consideration given to the type of exposure, duration of exposure, time since exposure, known infection status of the birds the person was exposed to, and to whether the exposed person is at higher risk for complications from seasonal influenza (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/avianflu/guidance-exposed-persons.htm). Chemoprophylaxis is not routinely recommended for personnel who used proper PPE while handling sick or potentially infected birds or decontaminating infected environments (including animal disposal). If antiviral chemoprophylaxis is initiated, treatment dosing for the neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir or zanamivir (one dose twice daily) is recommended instead of the typical antiviral chemoprophylaxis regimen. For specific dosage recommendations for treatment by age group, please see Influenza Antiviral Medications: Summary for Clinicians. Physicians should consult the manufacturer’s package insert for dosing, limitations of populations studied, contraindications, and adverse effects. If exposure was time-limited and not ongoing, five days of medication (one dose twice daily) from the last known exposure is recommended. Treating Symptomatic Persons with Bird Exposure Outpatients meeting bird exposure criteria who develop signs and symptoms compatible with influenza should be referred for prompt medical evaluation and empiric initiation of influenza antiviral treatment with a neuraminidase inhibitor, oseltamivir or zanamivir, or the cap-dependent endonuclease inhibitor, baloxavir, as soon as possible. Clinical benefit is greatest when antiviral treatment is administered early, especially within 48 hours of illness onset. Hospitalized patients who are confirmed, probable, or suspected cases of human infection with HPAI A(H5N1) virus, regardless of time since illness onset are recommended to initiate antiviral treatment with oral or enterically administered oseltamivir as soon as possible. Antiviral treatment should not be delayed while waiting for laboratory testing results. For detailed guidance on dosing and treatment duration, please see Interim Guidance of the Use of Antiviral Medications for the Treatment of Human Infection with Novel Influenza A Viruses Associated with Severe Human Disease (http://www.cdc.gov/flu/avianfluovel-av-treatment-guidance.htm). Monitoring and Chemoprophylaxis of Close Contacts of Persons with HPAI A(H5N1) virus infection: Recommendations for monitoring and chemoprophylaxis of close contacts of infected persons are different than those that apply to persons who meet bird exposure criteria. Post-exposure prophylaxis of close contacts of a person with HPAI A(H5N1) virus infection is recommended with oseltamivir twice daily (treatment dosing) instead of the once daily pre-exposure prophylaxis dosing. For detailed guidance, please see Interim Guidance on Follow-up of Close Contacts of Persons Infected with Novel Influenza A Viruses and Use of Antiviral Medications for Chemoprophylaxis. Vaccination No human vaccines for HPAI A(H5N1) are currently available in the United States. Seasonal influenza vaccines do not provide any protection against human infection with HPAI A(H5N1) viruses.

April 25, 2022 Contact: Eric Stann, 573-882-3346, stanne@missouri.edu The COVID-19 pandemic might have overshadowed the usual concerns about the annual flu season, but the virus continues to be a top priority for Henry Wan, a virologist at the University of Missouri, who believes understanding and preventing influenza remains paramount. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about 8% of the United States population gets sick from the flu each year. Young children; pregnant women; people 65 years and older; and those with medical conditions, such as asthma or diabetes, are at higher risk of developing serious illness from the influenza virus. Wan’s long-term goal is to customize the annual influenza vaccine into personalized medicine. As the incoming director of the NextGen Center for Influenza and Emerging Infectious Diseases Wan will be one step closer to making his goal a reality. Wan’s long-term goal is to customize the annual influenza vaccine into personalized medicine. As the incoming director of the NextGen Center for Influenza and Emerging Infectious Diseases — which is scheduled to open later this year in fall 2022 — Wan will be one step closer to making his goal a reality. The $6.5 million project will include space for replicating both extreme hot and cold climates, which is an important factor in the study of infectious disease transmission. Wan’s interest in influenza began after experiencing multiple animal and human infectious disease outbreaks while growing up in a small town on the Yangtze River in central China. He said 60% of infectious disease outbreaks in human populations happen this way: beginning as zoonotic diseases, or diseases that pass between animals and humans with most of the cases starting in animals. To better understand the influenza virus, researchers must first understand how these types of respiratory infectious diseases work. To better understand the influenza virus, researchers must first understand how these types of respiratory infectious diseases work. Years of education and research led Wan to study this phenomenon at the CDC and Mississippi State University prior to joining Mizzou. Now, his research is taking him to a project in support the NextGen Precision Health initiative that will be located 10 miles south of the MU campus on Middlebush Farm. A rendering of the exterior of the NextGen Center for Influenza and Emerging Infectious Diseases, which is scheduled to open later this year in fall 2022. “We want to look at how we can improve our influenza vaccination by studying both the animal and the human sides of this disease,” Wan said. “Both aspects are equally important in allowing us to execute the necessary research and vaccine improvements. Our work will help us better understand how the disease transmits between humans and animals, how these viruses mutate and affect hosts differently, and how we can make the influenza vaccine better and stronger.” “We want to look at how we can improve our influenza vaccination by studying both the animal and the human sides of this disease,” Wan said. Wan holds joint appointments in the School of Medicine, College of Engineering and College of Veterinary Medicine. He is also an investigator at the Christopher S. Bond Life Sciences Center. He believes vaccinations can be among the most effective ways to treat influenza; therefore, a large portion of his research is devoted to studying how the vaccine works. “I use my skills and laboratory experiments to better understand two aspects of influenza transmission and vaccines,” Wan said. “I study transmission to expand my knowledge on how influenza affects different hosts like animals and humans. On the vaccine side, I want to learn how to develop better vaccines and understand their effectiveness, as these types of viruses continue to develop and mutate.” Wan said COVID-19 and influenza can confuse people because they share similar symptoms, such as cough, runny nose, sore throat, fever, headache and fatigue. They also can both be asymptomatic. “However, these two diseases are caused by two different viruses, and molecular diagnosis can be used to confirm the type of disease,” Wan said. When the weather cools, these respiratory diseases are more likely to spread and mutate, giving people different symptoms as that happens. “The influenza vaccine can significantly reduce disease severity, decrease the likelihood for individuals to be infected and help block virus transmission within the community,” Wan said. The CDC also recommends preventative actions such as washing hands often with soap and water.

A case of H5 bird flu has been detected in a Colorado man younger than 40 years old, health officials say. Ron Harris/AP CNN — A case of influenza A(H5), also known as H5 bird flu, has been confirmed in a man in Colorado who had direct exposure to poultry and the culling of birds with presumptive H5N1 bird flu, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a statement Thursday. “This is the second human case associated with this specific group of H5 viruses that are currently predominant, and the first case in the United States,” the CDC said. A sign is seen at the Milwaukee County Zoo showing the bird exhibits are closed to protect against bird flu Tuesday, April 5, 2022, in Milwaukee. (AP Photo/Morry Gash) Morry Gash/AP Related article Zoos are moving their birds indoors to protect them against a deadly strain of the avian flu The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) said the man is a state inmate younger than 40 who was working at a commercial farm in Montrose County. The man has recovered after experiencing fatigue, CDPHE said. He is currently isolated and is being treated with the antiviral drug oseltamivir. “Repeat testing on the person was negative for influenza,” Colorado officials said in the statement. “Because the person was in close contact with infected poultry, the virus may have been in the person’s nose without causing infection.” The CDC also said it’s possible that the detection was a result of surface contamination. “This one H5-positive human case does not change the human health risk assessment,” the CDC said. “CDC is taking routine preparedness and prevention measures, which includes an existing candidate vaccine virus that could be used to make vaccine for people if one were needed.” Workers at a checkpoint stand at an Iowa commercial poultry facility, reported to have been hit with a deadly strain of avian influenza which has forced poultry producers to kill off millions of birds in an attempt to stop the spread of the illness. Scott Olson/Getty Images Related article Avian Flu Fast Facts People who are at higher risk of infection because of regular contact with infected birds should take precautions outlined on the CDC’s website. Preventative measures include avoiding contact with poultry that appear ill or are dead and staying away from surfaces that appear to be contaminated with feces from wild or domestic birds. If handling wild birds or poultry, wear gloves and wash your hands when done. People may also wear a face mask and goggles if possible. In February, the avian flu was first detected in a commercial turkey flock in Dubois County, Indiana, according to the US Department of Agriculture. This was the first case of infection in the US since 2020. The disease caused by the flu has been confirmed in commercial and backyard flocks across at least two dozen states and in wild birds across more than 30 states, according to the department. Earlier this month, the spread led zoo officials across the country to move their birds indoors temporarily as a safety precaution.

Here, cage-free chickens walk in a fenced pasture at an organic farm near Waukon, Iowa, in October 2015. Charlie Neibergall/AP A man in Colorado is the first human in the U.S. to test positive for bird flu, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Thursday. The case comes as the H5N1 bird influenza tears through the U.S., posing a low risk to humans while leading to the deaths of millions of birds. Some of the birds have died from the disease, but the vast majority of them are being culled to curb the spread. The patient, who is younger than 40, was involved in the culling of presumptively infected poultry at a commercial farm in Colorado's Montrose County, according to the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. He is an inmate at a state correctional facility in Delta County and was working with poultry as part of a pre-release employment program. Sponsor Message Business Avian flu is infecting U.S. poultry flocks. It could affect the price of chicken, too Members of the response team were all given personal protective equipment while working on the farm, and the affected flock has been euthanized. The patient has since recovered after reporting fatigue that lasted a few days as his only symptom. He was treated with oseltamivir, an antiviral influenza medication commonly sold under the Tamiflu brand. The virus was detected on a single nasal specimen and could have been present in the patient's nose without causing infection, according to a statement from Colorado authorities. This case marks the second human case associated with this group of H5 viruses — the first case occurred in the U.K. in December 2021, according to the CDC. The first patient lived with a large number of birds that became infected with H5N1, according to the World Health Organization. Animals Bald eagles around the U.S. are contracting the bird flu Still, for the general public, the human risk of bird flu remains low, the CDC says. Those who have job-related or recreational exposure to infected birds are at higher risk for infection. "We want to reassure Coloradans that the risk to them is low," said Dr. Rachel Herlihy, the state epidemiologist, in the statement. Both wild birds and commercial and backyard flocks are contracting bird flu. More than 35 million birds in flocks across 30 states have been affected. A total of 58,070 birds have been affected in Colorado, according to the latest data from the U.S. Agriculture Department. In Iowa, one of the worst-hit states, more than 13 million birds have been affected. avian flu Facebook Flipboard Email Read & Listen Home News Culture Music Podcasts & Shows Connect Newsletters Facebook Instagram Press Public Editor Corrections Contact & Help About NPR Overview Diversity NPR Network Accessibility Ethics Finances Get Involved Support Public Radio Sponsor NPR NPR Careers NPR Shop NPR Events NPR Extra Terms of Use Privacy Your Privacy Choices Text Only Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsorH3N8: Flu Virus Seen as Likely Cause of 95 Colorado Horse Deaths - Bloomberg Skip to content Bloomberg the Company & Its ProductsThe Company & its ProductsBloomberg Terminal Demo RequestBloomberg Anywhere Remote LoginBloomberg Anywhere LoginBloomberg Customer SupportCustomer Support BloombergConnecting decision makers to a dynamic network of information, people and ideas, Bloomberg quickly and accurately delivers business and financial information, news and insight around the world For CustomersBloomberg Anywhere Remote LoginSoftware UpdatesManage Products and Account Information SupportAmericas+1 212 318 2000EMEA+44 20 7330 7500Asia Pacific+65 6212 1000 CompanyAboutCareersDiversity and InclusionTech At BloombergPhilanthropySustainabilityBloomberg LondonBloomberg BetaGender-Equality Index CommunicationsPress AnnouncementsPress Contacts FollowFacebookInstagramLinkedInTwitterYouTube ProductsBloomberg TerminalDataTradingRiskComplianceIndices Industry ProductsBloomberg LawBloomberg TaxBloomberg GovernmentBloombergNEF MediaBloomberg MarketsBloomberg TechnologyBloomberg PursuitsBloomberg PoliticsBloomberg OpinionBloomberg BusinessweekBloomberg Live ConferencesBloomberg RadioBloomberg TelevisionNews Bureaus Media ServicesBloomberg Media DistributionAdvertising CompanyAboutCareersDiversity and InclusionTech At BloombergPhilanthropySustainabilityBloomberg LondonBloomberg BetaGender-Equality Index CommunicationsPress AnnouncementsPress Contacts FollowFacebookInstagramLinkedInTwitterYouTube ProductsBloomberg TerminalDataTradingRiskComplianceIndices Industry ProductsBloomberg LawBloomberg TaxBloomberg GovernmentBloomberg EnvironmentBloombergNEF MediaBloomberg MarketsBloomberg TechnologyBloomberg PursuitsBloomberg PoliticsBloomberg OpinionBloomberg BusinessweekBloomberg Live ConferencesBloomberg RadioBloomberg TelevisionNews Bureaus Media ServicesBloomberg Media DistributionAdvertising BloombergConnecting decision makers to a dynamic network of information, people and ideas, Bloomberg quickly and accurately delivers business and financial information, news and insight around the world For CustomersBloomberg Anywhere Remote LoginSoftware UpdatesManage Contracts and Orders SupportAmericas+1 212 318 2000EMEA+44 20 7330 7500Asia Pacific+65 6212 1000 Sign InSubscribeSearchLive TVMarketsChevron DownEconomicsIndustriesTechPoliticsBusinessweekOpinionMoreChevron DownUS EditionChevron DownMenuSubscribeBusinessPrognosisFlu Virus Seen as Likely Cause of 95 Colorado Horse DeathsFacebookTwitterLinkedInEmailLinkGiftExpandPhotographer: Prisma by Dukas/Universal Images Group/Getty ImagesFacebookTwitterLinkedInEmailLinkGiftGift this articleShare feedbackNew WindowHave a confidential tip for our reporters?

Bruce G. Gellin, MD, MPH, Chief of Global Public Health Strategy for The Rockefeller Foundation’s Pandemic Prevention Institute, will receive the 2022 John P. Utz Leadership Award in recognition of his leadership and lifelong work to prevent infections through education, communication, and collaboration, as evidenced by his numerous national and international positions focusing on the reduction of infectious diseases through vaccination.Throughout his distinguished career, Dr. Gellin has held numerous positions leading and advising on global immunization, strategic policy development, and pandemic preparedness and response at national, multinational, non-governmental, and institutional organizations. He has led key federal vaccine initiatives, including developing the National Vaccine Plan at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and creating the first HHS pandemic influenza preparedness and response plan. Dr. Gellin has consulted as a technical expert to Gavi and serves as a key advisor to the WHO on global immunization, including chairing the WHO Global Action Plan for Influenza Vaccines Advisory Group, and serving as a member of both the WHO Expert Advisory Group on SAGE Evaluation and the WHO Working Group on Influenza Preparedness and Response.“Bruce’s focus on vaccine demand as a public health issue both nationally and globally has made him a well-known champion of public health. He is a skilled immunization advocate through public policy, clear communication, and strategic planning and has made a distinguished impact worthy of this award,” said NFID President-Elect Patricia Stinchfield, RN, MS, CPNP.Dr. Gellin will join two additional honorees when the awards are presented during the 2022 NFID Awards Gala & Silent Auction in Washington, DC in December 2022:Katherine L. O’Brien, MD, MPH, director of the Department of Immunization, Vaccines, and Biologicals at the World Health Organization (WHO), will receive the 2022 Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter Humanitarian Award in recognition of her achievements as an international leader in vaccinology and a tireless champion for global vaccine equity. In her role at WHO, she has provided outstanding leadership in shaping the Covid-19 vaccine global strategy. Through guiding the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE), she helped to develop new policies for 10 separate Covid-19 vaccines, while being a major voice for equitable vaccine access in low- and middle-income countries. Renowned for her ground-breaking research, Dr. O’Brien was one of the first investigators to quantify the global burden of pneumococcal disease, its serotypes, and define the relationship between nasopharyngeal colonization and acquisition of disease, unlocking the case for pneumococcal vaccine use globally. Her contributions to decision-making and policy development by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance have enabled millions of children throughout the world to have access to not only life-saving, affordable pneumococcal conjugate vaccines, but also vaccines against HPV, polio, Covid-19, and soon malaria, among others. “Dr. O’Brien’s extraordinary leadership has been evident during the Covid-19 pandemic, where she has tirelessly advocated and worked for vaccine equity,” said Kathryn M. Edwards, MD, of Vanderbilt University Medical Center, citing Dr. O’Brien’s contributions to COVAX and the remarkable achievements of delivering more than 1 billion doses of vaccine to the world’s poorest countries.Barney S. Graham, MD, PhD, senior advisor for Global Health Equity and professor of Medicine and Microbiology, Biochemistry, and Immunology at Morehouse School of Medicine, and former deputy director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Vaccine Research Center at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), will receive the 2022 Maxwell Finland Award for Scientific Achievement in recognition of his outstanding work in viral pathogenesis and vaccine development, culminating in his lab’s foundational discovery leading to safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccines worldwide. Dr. Graham’s innovative work on the structure of the prefusion F in respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) established a “game-changing” approach to structure-based vaccine design that is now being applied to the development of vaccines for coronaviruses and other important pathogens, including Ebola virus and influenza. “Dr. Graham’s work is not only important scientifically, but has and will continue to impact millions of lives, including the most vulnerable among us,” said Mark R. Denison, MD, of Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. Dr. Graham’s contributions have distinguished him as a leader in the approach to current viral pathogens and the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as a futurist in anticipating and preparing for emerging pathogens with pandemic potential.2022 NFID Awards Gala & Silent AuctionThe awards will be presented at the 2022 NFID Awards Gala & Silent Auction, a black-tie event scheduled for December 8, 2022, in Washington, DC (based on public health recommendations at that time). The 2022 Gala will mark the kick-off of a year-long celebration of the 50th Anniversary of NFID. Tickets and sponsorship opportunities will be available online at www.nfid.org/awards this summer.

Bombard | nbombard@masslive.comWhile cases of COVID-19 have continued to increase this spring after hitting a low in the beginning of March, it’s not the only virus out there making a comeback.If you or someone you know is sick and testing negative for COVID, you may have the flu.Cases of influenza across Massachusetts have been on the rise for the past two months. According to the weekly flu report from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, the estimated weekly severity of the flu across the state is now at “moderate” levels. Yet a closer look shows that Central, Northeast, Southeast and West regions have now grown to “high” severity levels.According to DPH, weekly severity is determined by combining influenza-like illness, hospitalizations, and influenza-positive test results reported to the state.But what’s more unusual is that the levels have been climbing at a time of year they are typically in decline.The weekly flu report from the state tracks influenza-like illnesses as reported by 93 “sentinel sites” across the state. Reports from the sites are used throughout the season to help track influenza activity in individuals who are not tested. Trends in influenza-like illnesses have been shown to mirror influenza trends, the state reports.“The majority of individuals with influenza-like illness are not tested; therefore, the number of positive test results does not reflect the total number of influenza cases in Massachusetts,” the state said in its weekly report.Yet, confirmed lab tests also show cases have climbed.Laboratory confirmed flu cases increased by 27% this week, according to DPH.According to the Centers for Diseasce Control, flu activity is highest right now in the Northeast, South-Central and Mountain regions of the U.S.The percentage of visits to sentinel provider sites in Massachusetts for influenza cases for the past four years (Massachusetts Department of Public Health).Influenza was largely dormant in 2020 and 2021, which health experts attribute to shutdowns, masking, social distancing and other measures that accompanied the coronavirus pandemic, which not only worked to curtail COVID but had the effect of stopping the spread of other communicable diseases as well.Flu cases this year are back, somewhat. According to data from the state, reports of influenza-like cases from provider sites this year are higher than the 2020-2021 season but still much lower than the two seasons prior to the pandemic.They also began rising about the same time that COVID cases began to uptick as well — around the beginning of March.Although officials have not identified any clear reason for flu cases rising in April — a time they have typically declined — a return to normal following pandemic restrictions is one possible cause.“Most of us have thought that this last end-of-season smoldering, slightly increasing number of cases here and there is probably due to people taking off their masks, going out to group activities, going indoors to restaurants, worship services, concerts, starting to go back in-person in business — all of those kinds of activities are still presenting some opportunities for this respiratory virus to be spread,” Dr. William Schaffner, the medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, told Healthline.The number of laboratory confirmed influenza cases in Massachusetts by week (Massachusetts Department of Public Health).RECOMMENDED•masslive.comPoachers exploit demand for eagle feathers, sacred among Native AmericansNov. 7, 2024, 9:00 a.m.The flu vaccination rate for all ages in Massachusetts is currently 48%, the Department of Public Health reports. By comparison, more than 75% of the state is fully vaccinated against COVID. Influenza A (H3N2) is the predominant strain in Massachusetts right now, which the vaccine protects against. However, vaccine effectiveness can wane over time as viruses continue to evolve.As of Feb. 12, 2022, the CDC had genetically characterized 65 influenza A viruses from U.S. Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network participants.The percent of hospitalizations associated with influenza in Massachusetts is 0.89%, according to DPH, which is higher than last season and the 2019-2020 season, but lower than the 2018-2019 season.If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

They say the influenza is highly contagious. The Wet Mountains overlook the pens of the East Cañon City Prison Complex. (credit: Mark Neitro, CBS4) "In short term (holding facilities), the animals are naïve, and they are going to get exposure. The severity of outbreaks is reduced by our vaccination protocols," John Neill, Bureau of Land Management off Range Pasture Contractor Representative said. Neill spoke with CBS4 in general terms about the BLM's disease outbreak mitigation protocols for wild horses in BLM holding facilities, he could not comment about the Cañon City incident specifically. Neill said that the vaccination program does not 100% prevent outbreaks. But he says, "It can keep it controlled. And additional vet care can come in and be administered as needed." The BLM tells Kati Weis that horses are not exposed to equine diseases when they are wild on the range. More than 2,500 horses are currently kept at the facility in Cañon City. The illness became apparent late last week among horses mostly gathered from the West Douglas area west of Meeker in Western Colorado, according to the BLM. In addition, some of the ill horses were gathered in the Sand Wash Basin to the north in northwest Colorado. The BLM says it tested several horses. Veterinarians also found some of the horses had herpes. Wild horse advocates say the outbreak demonstrates inadequate care at the Cañon City facility. "The situation at Cañon City is shining a light on the unsanitary and inhumane conditions that America's wild horses are being forced to live in after being ripped from a life free on western public lands," said Suzanne Roy, American Wild Horse Campaign Executive Director. If the horses survive in Cañon City, and are not adopted out, they are transported to other long-term holding facilities across the country, potentially including one in eastern Nebraska. Weis visited the facility in Maxwell, Nebraska. Taxpayers spend $78 million a year to care for wild horses in long-term and short-term facilities nationwide. Watch CBS4 and CBS News Colorado for follow up reports from Weis in Nebraska next week that will further examine the use of taxpayer dollars on the controversial wild horse program.

Here’s how it works. (Image credit: CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images) A 4-year-old boy in China has become the first human case of the H3N8 strain of bird flu, according to news reports.The boy, who lives in Henan province, was exposed to chickens and crows at his home, which could have transmitted the virus, according to news reports. The boy was infected with an avian version of the H3N8 virus, though strains of this virus can also infect horses (known as equine influenza virus) and dogs (known as canine influenza virus. And now it has made the leap to humans, though the risk of it spreading from human to human is low, according to a Reuters report.Though avian flu viruses originated in birds and don't easily spread to other animals, in rare cases, strains have adapted to infect other animals — such as dogs and horses — as well as humans, Live Science previously reported. Bird flu strains that have hopped to humans include: H5N1, H7N9, H5N6, H5N8 and now H3N8. A genetic analysis of the Henan province case suggests the variant came about through a shuffling of genes from more than one avian flu virus, making it a reassortant. This type of mixed-up virus "can have unpredictable capacity in terms of transmission and virulence in human population," said Marius Gilbert, an epidemiologist at the Université Libre de Bruxelles in Belgium, as reported by The Guardian. This particular case of H3N8 holds genes from viruses previously found in poultry and wild birds, Reuters reported.Related: The deadliest viruses in historyThe fact that this variety of H3N8 has hopped to a human does not mean it can spread easily between humans, experts say. "We often see a virus spread to a human and then not spread any further so a single case is not a cause of great concern," said Sir Peter Horby, professor of emerging infectious diseases and global health at the University of Oxford, The Guardian reported.In June of last year, China also reported the first human case of another bird flu, called H10N3, Live Science reported at the time. The 41-year-old man in the city of Zhenjiang was hospitalized but ultimately discharged.Sign up for the Live Science daily newsletter nowGet the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.RELATED STORIES—6 new discoveries about viruses—Death from rare tick-borne virus reported in Maine—'Highly pathogenic' bird flu hits US farmBecause avian influenza has the potential to trigger outbreaks in humans, health organizations closely monitor new variants. In 2016 and 2017, for instance, an outbreak of H7N9 in China led to the deaths of more than 300 people, according to Science Magazine. And the H2N2 strain of bird flu caused a pandemic in 1957 after it swapped genes with human flu viruses; the death toll from it reached 1.1 million worldwide, including 116,000 deaths in the United States, the CDC reported. The virus behind the 1918 pandemic, called H1N1, likely also came from birds, Live Science reported.In February of 2021, Russia reported the first case of avian influenza strain H5N8 passing from poultry to humans, Live Science reported. Though there was no evidence of human-to-human spread, seven poultry plant workers were infected with the strain. There is no information about the health status of the young boy infected with the H3N8 strain of bird flu.Originally published on Live Science.

Here's what to know.Skip to main content HomeU.S.SportsEntertainmentLifeMoneyTechTravelOpinionFor SubscribersWeatherInvestigationsCrosswordsHumankindNewslettersMediaFor YouContributor Content Worried about bird flu? Here's what it is, what to know about its symptomsOrlando Mayorquin | USA TODAYShow Caption Hide Caption Bird flu can spread amongst humans, but is very rareWhile bird flu is rarely seen in humans, it shares many of the same symptoms as the regular flu.Damien Henderson, Getty ImagesThe worst avian flu outbreak in years is ripping through the United States, leading to the deaths of more than 24 million birds. The H5N1 virus has ravaged commercial and backyard poultry in 29 states, with nearly 250 outbreaks, according to the Centers for Disease Control. American consumers have felt the bird flu in the form of higher egg prices, which more than doubled in March. But on Thursday, the CDC reported the first human case of the current dominant bird flu virus in the United States. An inmate in Colorado contracted the flu after exposure while working at a poultry farm.Still, public health officials say the risk of transmission in the general public is low. Bird flu's economic impact: Worst bird flu in years drives up egg prices, prompts precautions against spread to humansWhat is the bird flu? The bird flu, also known as the avian flu, refers to the disease caused by a family of flu viruses primarily transmitted between birds.The dominant virus strain circulating currently is called H5N1. It is extremely contagious among birds, who spread it by shedding the virus in their saliva, feces and through nasal secretions. The virus originates in wild birds, but can spread to domesticated birds and lead to rapid, massive outbreaks. Avian influenza viruses are classified into two groups: Low Pathogenic Avian Influenza (LPAI) and Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI). LPAI viruses cause mild or no disease, while HPAI cause severe disease and high death rates in infected birds, according to the CDC. Bird Flu symptoms in humansWhile possible, avian flu virus infections in humans are considered rare. The human infection reported in Colorado is only the second confirmed human infection of the present outbreak in the world. The first confirmed infection was reported in December in a United Kingdom man who had ducks living inside his home. He presented no symptoms.The man infected in Colorado showed mild symptoms of fatigue and was given antiviral medication for treatment. In China, officials confirmed the infection of a 4-year-old boy with a different strain, H3N8, after he reported a fever. Chinese health officials said his close contacts tested negative and that the strain posed little threat of wide spread. Bird flu symptoms have been reported to be largely the same as the seasonal flu.Symptoms can include cough, a sore throat, head and muscle aches, fatigue and shortness of breath.Severe infections can lead to pneumonia that requires hospitalizations. Sometimes infection can cause a fever. Less common symptoms include vomiting and diarrhea. Earlier this month, the World Health Organization reported that 863 H5N1 cases have been confirmed globally in 18 countries since 2003, causing 455 deaths.But the H5N1 virus in circulation now is different from prior versions, the CDC said, and the risk posed by bird flu to the public's health is still low. Human to human transmission is rare.“Even when people have been infected with bird flu viruses there has rarely been onward spread from one infected person to another person,” the CDC website reads. Most people who become infected become so after “close, prolonged and unprotected contact with infected birds.” Bird Flu prevention The best personal bird flu prevention is steering clear of prolonged exposure to birds. For those who work in close contact with poultry, hunt, or keep birds of their own, the CDC recommends implementing extra precautions like wearing gloves, mask and eye protection.Coronavirus watch: Stay safe and informed with updates on the spread of the coronavirusAnimal migration: Climate change pushing animals to migrate, increasing risks of new pandemics, study finds Facebook Twitter EmailShare your feedback to help improve our site!HelpTerms of ServiceSubscription Terms & ConditionsPrivacy PolicySite MapAccessibilityOur Ethical PrinciplesResponsible DisclosureYour Privacy Choices © Copyright Gannett 2024Nearly 100 wild horses die at a Colorado facility, equine influenza the likely cause of a major outbreak Skip to contentNewsWeatherSportsContests11 CaresWatch Live11 ConnectsEspañolHomeElection ResultsPresidential Election MapColorado Interactive ResultsNewsEspañolCrimeInternationalNationalPoliticsStateWantedWeatherWeather CamsTraffic WatchWeather Maps7-Day ForecastsRadarWatch LiveSubmit a Story IdeaSubmit Photos and VideosContestsFind ItSportsClassroom ChampionsNCAANFLScoreboardNationalViewhouse Sports BlitzFriday Night EndzoneBroncosAir ForceAdvertise With UsStation JobsKKTV News App11 Connects11 CaresCommunity CalendarGood News FridayVideoMeet the TeamContact UsMr. FoodMyKKTVMeTVSign up for .COM DailyTV ListingsZeam - News StreamsCircle CountryGray DC BureauInvestigateTVWatching Your WalletPowerNation11 For HealthDigital MarketingClosings and DelaysDismiss Closings Alerts BarNearly 100 wild horses die at a Colorado facility, equine influenza the likely cause of a major outbreakGeneric photo of a horse.(MGN)By Tony KeithPublished: Apr. 26, 2022 at 2:10 PM MDT|Updated: Apr. 28, 2022 at 7:02 PM MDTEmail This LinkShare on FacebookShare on X (formerly Twitter)Share on PinterestShare on LinkedInCANON CITY, Colo. (KKTV) - The Bureau of Land Management is providing an update to the public after nearly 100 horses at a facility in Canon City died.Officials believe an equine influenza virus is the “likely” cause of an outbreak that killed at least 95 animals at the Wild Horse and Burro Facility since April 23. According to the BLM, more typical mild clinical signs of influenza are also being observed in approximately 10-20 percent of the other 2,184 horses at the facility that are not from West Douglas. No mortality has occurred in the larger groups of horses. The West Douglas horses were gathered in an emergency operation in 2021 following a wildfire that impacted their habitat.“The Bureau of Land Management will review operations at the Canon City facility to prevent future outbreaks like this from occurring,” said BLM Colorado Acting Associate State Director Ben Gruber. “This tragic outcome was influenced by a population of horses that may have been particularly vulnerable given their time in the West Douglas area and their exposure to last year’s wildfire that prompted their emergency gather.”Click here for more information about the outbreak and the BLM’s response.

The virus has already caused widespread outbreaks throughout Asia, Africa and Europe, resulting in millions of deaths in poultry and wild birds.In this Perspective, Michelle Wille and Ian Barr discuss the factors that have led to global H5N1 HPAIv outbreaks, the consequences of this spread, and what can be done to curb it. “The ongoing 2021-2022 wave of avian influenza H5N1 is unprecedented in its rapid spread and extremely high frequency of outbreaks in poultry and wild birds, and is a continuing potential threat to humans,” the authors write.Global distribution of AIV with zoonotic potential* observed since 01 October 2021 (i.e. current wave)Since 2020, highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses have spread across the globe. Although such viruses often emerge in high-density poultry production systems, they can also infect wild migratory birds. One particular lineage, H5N1, is responsible for the most recent wave of infections, which have been identified across Eurasia and in Africa and North America.

Yes, I'll pitch in. The virus can be deadly in bird populations and has already caused mass mortality events in wild birds, threatening whole populations, particularly those already endangered. What’s more, the virus has already had a substantial impact on poultry production. In 2020 and 2021 alone, roughly 15 million poultry have been culled or have died because of HPAIv infections.Perhaps most concerning is the virus’s ability to infect humans. Although bird-to-human infections have been rare in the last two decades, and sustained human-to-human transmission has yet to be documented, highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses pose a potential pandemic risk. Further adaption in this current virus could increase its ability to transmit between humans efficiently. To avoid this, Wille and Barr argue that international health and agricultural organizations need to take each avian influenza outbreak seriously, particularly in settings where humans are involved. Among other measures, they call for continued investment in surveillance of wild birds and poultry and of humans at the human-poultry interface. They note that measures such as reduction of flock size and density and avoidance of poultry production in waterbird-rich areas have been proposed to prevent spillovers of HPAIv into wild birds.ARTICLE TITLE: Resurgence of avian influenza virus.

The facility at the new center will mimic the tropical and temperate climates where the flu virus replicates in nature, he said.Wan has appointments in the School of Medicine, College of Veterinary Medicine and the College of Engineering at MU.Animal studies are part of Wan's research."We want animals that mimic how humans transmit the flu and how humans respond to vaccines," Wan said.Pigs are the go-to animals for researchers on both counts, Wan said.A majority of infectious disease outbreaks in humans start in animals, he said.About 8% of the U.S. population gets sick from the flu each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The individualized flu vaccines are a long-term goal and will require more research. Keeping the flu vaccine affordable is important, he said."We are trying to work toward that goal" of individualized vaccines, he said. "More research will be useful in reaching that goal."The $6.5 million NextGen Center for Influenza and Emerging Infectious Diseases will be a big advance to research, Wan said.The center has earned $15 million in National Institutes of Health and CDC funding in the past two years, according to a September 2021 UM System Board of Curators agenda."It's exciting," Wan said.Roger McKinney is the education reporter for the Tribune.

The recommendations from Dr. Victoria Hall came as researchers are trying to learn more about the role of songbirds in HPAI outbreaks.“During these unprecedented times, we recommend doing anything that we can to try and help our wild bird populations. Because the science is unclear on the role of songbirds in this current H5N1 outbreak, one consideration is to not encourage birds to gather together at places such as bird feeders or bird baths. These are places where things like viruses could easily be exchanged between individuals,” Hall said.The National Wildlife Disease Program hasn’t issued any formal recommendations to take down bird feeders, however, as pointed out by Allaboutbirds.org. According to Dr. Julianna Lenoch, director of the U.S. Department of Education APHIS National Wildlife Disease Program, there is currently a very low risk of an outbreak among wild songbirds but people who keep domestic poultry, such as backyard chickens, should take down any feeders to help prevent HPAI spread.“USDA APHIS has a strong, multiyear surveillance program that routinely samples wild birds, including flocks of songbirds (and other species such as Rock Pigeons and Mourning Doves that are often around humans), for the presence of avian influenza. So far in 2022, they’ve detected the HPAI strain in 763 wild birds, with only one detection in a songbird, an American Crow in North Dakota,” Lenoch said.It is recommended that people clean their bird feeders and birdbaths regularly as a way to keep HPAI and other diseases away. You can see more on that here.Avian influenza does not affect all types of birds equally. Waterfowl often carry and transmit bird flu but don’t typically get sick. Raptors are much more sensitive as are domestic poultry, which spread the disease easily leading up to 100% mortality of affected flocks, experts said.READ MORE:Why experts say you should immediately stop filling birdfeedersAvian flu and bird feeders: Can you still feed hummingbirds?Avian influenza: Can humans get bird flu?

The Cree health board is asking hunters to be on the lookout for signs of avian influenza. There are now several confirmed cases in wild and non-wild bird populations in the South across the country. (Submitted by Roger Orr)Social SharingOfficials at the Cree health board are asking hunters to keep an eye out for avian influenza as they head out for the annual Goose Break holiday, while also spreading a message that there have been no signs of the disease so far in Cree territory. Three cases of the highly contagious H5N1 disease, which is often called bird-flu, have been confirmed in the wild bird population in the Montérégie region, south of Montreal and two more cases identified in the non-wild populations in the Eastern Townships, southeast of Montreal. "There is no evidence right now of any geese that have been infected in Eeyou Istchee and we haven't had any news from our hunters that go hunting down south," said George L. Diamond, a Planning, Programming and Research Officer with the Healthy and Safe Communities department of Cree Public Health.Eeyou Istchee is the traditional name of the Cree territory in Quebec. No evidence right now of any geese that have been infected in Eeyou Istchee.-George L. Diamond, Cree Public HealthBut with confirmed cases ticking upwards across the country, particularly in agricultural operations, officials across Canada are increasingly concerned that avian influenza will have a devastating impact on bird populations, both non-wild and wild.Dozens of cases across the country Avian influenza can be deadly for birds and dozens of cases have now been confirmed in British Columbia, Alberta, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Ontario, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Labrador, as well as Quebec. Avian flu suspected as B.C. farmer loses 80% of chickens in 4 days; new cases identified in Kelowna flockDiamond says it's important for Cree hunters to be vigilant to help slow the spread. The Cree health board has added information about avian influenza on its website, as many Cree are heading out to their traditional camps to hunt the geese returning to the territory.

Cree health is asking hunters to report any birds harvested this Spring, if they suspect they have avian influenza. (Susan Bell/ CBC North)Diamond says signs a bird is infected include weight loss and a clear or cloudy discharge through eyes, nose, beak or posterior.In live birds, signs include nervousness, tremor or lack of coordination; swelling around the head; neck or eyes; a lack of movement; coughing or diarrhea. Diamond says if a hunter suspects a bird is infected, he or she shouldn't handle the goose with their bare hands and should cover it to protect other animals."The first thing they should do is leave it alone … they shouldn't touch the goose," said Diamond. Cree health is also asking hunters to notify their local Cree Trappers Association. The Ministère des Forêts, de la Faune et des Parcs is also asking hunters to report possible cases to 1-877 346-6763.Little risk for peopleAccording to the federal government website, there have been no human cases of disease resulting from exposure to wild birds in North America.And while avian influenza isn't believed to pose a risk for people, Diamond advises not to eat the meat if there are clear signs the bird is infected. Our hunters ... know what a healthy bird looks like.- George L. Diamond, Cree Public Health"Our hunters have a vast knowledge on a healthy bird. They know what a healthy bird looks like. If a goose has the symptoms of avian flu … people shouldn't eat it," said Diamond. Southern huntIncreasing numbers of Cree hunters head south to hunt geese in parts of eastern Ontario and southern Quebec. Diamond said there have been no reports of Cree hunters killing infected birdsSeveral cases of avian influenza have been reported in Ontario, including at least one confirmation of an infected goose in the Ottawa area. Increasing numbers of Cree hunters head south in the early spring to hunt in farmers fields around Alfred, Ont. Diamond went on to say that the message from Cree health is to go out and enjoy the annual spring goose hunt."I encourage people to go out and do their spring hunt and enjoy their time out on the land. We are giving you all these precautions … to minimize the spread of avian flu because we don't want it to spread," said Diamond.CBC's Journalistic Standards and Practices|About CBC NewsCorrections and clarifications|Submit a news tip|Report errorFooter LinksMy AccountProfileCBC GemNewslettersAbout CBC AccountsConnect with CBCFacebookXYouTubeInstagramMobileRSSPodcastsContact CBCSubmit FeedbackHelp CentreAudience Relations, CBC P.O.

Then they found they too were disposableChris McGreal in Rembrandt, IowaThu 28 Apr 2022 10.00 BSTLast modified on Sat 30 Apr 2022 14.30 BSTShareLabourers at the one of the world’s largest egg factories arrived at the plant in Rembrandt, Iowa, early one morning in March to discover they were about to work themselves out of a job.As they gathered at the huge barns housing stacks of caged hens, the workers were told to forget about their usual routine of collecting eggs and feeding the birds. Overnight, the factory had begun slaughtering more than 5 million chickens using a gruesome killing method after detecting a single case of avian influenza. Even supervisors were assigned to the arduous task of dragging dead hens out of packed cages as Rembrandt Enterprises raced to contain the spread of the virus, amid the largest bird flu outbreak in the US in seven years.The culling has been repeated at chicken and turkey farms across Iowa and 28 other states from Maine to Utah. More than 22m birds have been killed in an attempt to contain the outbreak – the majority in Iowa, the US’s biggest producer of eggs. The slaughter of 5.3m hens at Rembrandt is the largest culling at any factory farm in the country.Workers spent nearly a month pulling the dead poultry from the cages and dumping them in carts before they were piled high in nearby fields and buried in huge pits. The killing over, about 250 people were summarily thrown out of work with just a few dozen skeleton staff remaining.In the weeks that followed, animal rights protesters targeted Rembrandt’s billionaire owner, Glen Taylor, over the cull, including disrupting games played by the professional basketball team he owns, the Minnesota Timberwolves. But few voices have been raised in support of Rembrandt’s workers, some of them undocumented migrants.Others fired from the plant contrast the seriousness with which the bird flu outbreak has been taken by Rembrandt’s management to what they describe as the company’s lax approach to the threat to workers from Covid, as it swept through factory farms and slaughterhouses in Iowa and elsewhere.“Right now everybody’s worried about the chickens,” said Oscar Garcia, a former supervisor at the plant. “We get it: it was really inhumane the way they killed them. But chickens are chickens, right? People worked in those barns pulling out dead birds in terrible conditions, faeces everywhere, doing 12- or 14-hour days.“They couldn’t protest because then they’d be fired and lose their redundancy pay. Then they’re thrown out of work and no one speaks for them.”Outside criticism of Rembrandt has focused on the method of killing. Chicken farms have previously slaughtered hens en masse by suffocating them with foam or pumping barns full of carbon dioxide, methods that have been criticized as inhumane.View image in fullscreenOscar Garcia, a former plant supervisor at Rembrandt Foods. Photograph: Dan Brouillette/The GuardianBut Tom Cullen of the Iowa newspaper the Storm Lake Times revealed that birds at Rembrandt were culled using a system known as ventilation shutdown plus (VSD+) in which air is closed off to the barns and heat pumped in until the temperature rises above 104F (40C).“They cooked those birds alive,” said one of the Rembrandt workers involved in the culling.An animal rights group, Animal Outlook, used freedom of information laws to obtain records of experiments at North Carolina State University that show that VSD+ causes “extreme suffering” to the hens as they “writhe, gasp, pant, stagger and even throw themselves against the walls of their confinement in a desperate attempt to escape”.“Eventually the birds collapse and, finally, die from heat and suffocation,” the group said.Members of another group, Direct Action Everywhere, have disrupted Timberwolves games in recent weeks wearing T-shirts proclaiming “Glen Taylor Roasts Animals Alive”.James Roth, director of the Center for Food Security and Public Health at Iowa state university’s college of veterinary medicine and an adviser to the federal government on biosecurity, acknowledged that VSD+ causes more suffering than other forms of culling, but said it is the most efficient means of containing the spread of bird flu because it is relatively swift.“Nobody wants to see it used, but sometimes it is, as a last resort. The rationale is if the influenza virus spreads so fast that it’ll go through a poultry house really rapidly, all of those birds produce massive amounts of virus in the air. Then you have a big plume of virus coming from that house that spreads to other poultry houses. It’s critical to get the birds euthanised before that virus becomes a huge plume of virus to spread,” he said.View image in fullscreenUSDA workers in the area where millions of chickens were dumped in a pit, on Rembrandt Foods property. Photograph: Dan Brouillette/The GuardianView image in fullscreenThe Rembrandt Foods plant. Photograph: Dan Brouillette/The GuardianRoth said that the authorities appear to have learned important lessons from 2015, when a bird flu outbreak resulted in what the US agriculture department calls “the largest poultry health disaster in US history”, with the slaughter of about 50 million chickens and turkeys.This time federal regulators moved quickly to contain the outbreak by shutting down the movement of workers between poultry flocks, a significant cause of the spread of avian flu in 2015. But Roth said this year the virus appears to have arrived in the US carried by waterfowl from Europe and to be better adapted to be spread by wild birds, which are harder to contain.That prompted the USDA to press for a swift culling at infected poultry farms. On 17 March, Rembrandt notified its supervisors that avian flu had been detected on the site.“They sent out email at 10.30pm letting us know they had a confirmed case,” said a former Rembrandt worker who was obliged to sign a non-disclosure agreement in order to receive redundancy payments.When the worker arrived the next day he discovered the company had already begun slaughtering millions of chickens.“Once they’re dead, we had to take them out by hand one by one, put them in a wheelbarrow. That’s really intense manual labour. They are not very big cages. Twelve chickens are crammed in there. Awful conditions,” he said.View image in fullscreenOnce the birds had been killed and buried, the company fired most of the workers. Photograph: Dan Brouillette/The Guardian“After it was over, we were told to attend a meeting. We walked in. There was a big stack of yellow envelopes. That’s like showing a knife to a chicken. You know what’s going to happen next. We worked ourselves out of a job. I saw people who had years and years of experience just being let go. It was totally unexpected.”Some workers thought the layoff might be temporary, as it was during the 2015 outbreak. But they were given redundancy payments and told to find other jobs, suggesting the move was permanent and raising questions about the future of the plant.Some of the skilled former workers have had little trouble finding another job. Others have struggled. “I’m just rushing to find a job in order to support my family,” said a former Rembrandt employee with several years at the company.Those struggling include undocumented workers who, Garcia said, were hired indirectly through third-party contractors.In February, the Storm Lake Times reported that a lawsuit by the family of a Guatemalan migrant worker who was crushed to death when cages collapsed on him revealed that he had been working under a false name through a subcontractor.Garcia also contrasted the seriousness with which Rembrandt took bird flu to the company’s handling of Covid-19 as it surged in Iowa, particularly among labourers working close together on factory farms and in slaughterhouses. He said Rembrandt appeared to care more about avian flu outbreaks than Covid. He criticised the management for failing to require workers to wear a mask or to be vaccinated.“They actually liked the fact that we didn’t require our employees to get vaccinated, because they were hoping we would get employees from the surrounding areas that were requiring their employees to get vaccinated. They’re using it almost as a recruitment tool,” he said.Other workers said that when they contracted Covid, they were obliged to use the days off they had earned as holidays instead of being given sick days.“It’s a company that makes millions of dollars. I guess I shouldn’t be surprised that it doesn’t care about people,” said Garcia.Rembrandt Enterprises has been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsBird fluIowaFarmingChickenAnimal welfareFoodAnimalsfeaturesShareReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this storyBird flu outbreak confirmed at East Yorkshire poultry farm5d agoBird flu in pheasants in England sparks concern over lax rearing rules17 Oct 2024Risk of bird flu spreading to humans is ‘enormous concern’, says WHO 18 Apr 2024Northumberland’s Farne Islands reopen to visitors after bird flu outbreak27 Mar 2024Avian flu outbreak confirmed at vital seabird colonies in Wales20 Jul 2023Human gene identified that prevents most bird flu viruses moving to people 28 Jun 2023RSPB calls for suspension of game-bird releases over avian flu fears18 May 2023Two poultry workers test positive for bird flu in England16 May 2023‘We feel more prepared’: Farne Islands face another season battling avian flu4 May 2023Most viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveTax strategyFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInXNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

But only sporadic human cases have been reported since 2015.What are the symptoms of the bird flu?According to The Mayo Clinic, the following symptoms of bird flu appear in infected individuals within two to seven days of infection:CoughFeverSore throatMuscle achesHeadacheShortness of breathOther symptoms might include nausea, diarrhea or vomiting.Some cases of bird flu may only show symptoms of a mild eye infection.Is there a vaccine for the bird flu?According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the U.S. government is preparing vaccines for different strains of the bird flu to be used in humans should they be needed.However, there is no vaccine for the most recent strain of bird flu (H3N8).To protect against the bird flu, the CDC recommends that every person 6 months and older receive a seasonal flu vaccine ideally two weeks before exposure to sick birds.RECOMMENDED•nj.comPoachers exploit demand for eagle feathers, sacred among Native AmericansNov. 7, 2024, 9:00 a.m.Man who killed eagles on a Native American reservation gets nearly 4 years in prisonNov. 7, 2024, 9:00 a.m.While it will not guarantee protection against bird flu, it reduce the odds of getting sick with human and bird flu at the same time.Our journalism needs your support.

Bird FluNewsU.S. Reports Its First Human Case of Bird FluThe individual affected was working with infected poultry; CDC says public health risk remains low.ByDon RaufFact CheckedUpdated on April 29, 2022Influenza among poultry and wild birds has been spreading rapidly throughout the United States and around the globe.Getty ImagesA worker in Colorado helping to cull (depopulate) poultry that was presumed to have H5N1 bird flu has become the first person in America to test positive for avian influenza, according to a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Thursday.The infected individual only experienced fatigue for a few days and has since recovered. The worker is being isolated and treated with influenza antiviral drug oseltamivir, which works by stopping the spread of the flu virus in the body.The CDC stressed that the health risk to the public remains low. The federal health agency has tracked more than 2,500 people with exposures to H5N1 virus-infected birds and this is the only case in the United States that has been found to date.Influenza among poultry and wild birds, however, has been spreading rapidly throughout the United States and around the globe. In January, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported that the United Kingdom had confirmed the only other known human case of this type of bird flu so far. China recorded its first human infection of another bird flu strain (H3N8) earlier in April. Reuters said the variant was found in a 4-year-old boy who had been in contact with chickens and crows raised at his home. He fell sick with fever and other symptoms.The Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP) calls the U.S. outbreak — which has led to the loss of 35.5 million birds — the worst since 2015. The virus has infected commercial and backyard birds in 29 states and wild birds in 34 states.In this week alone, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) was notified of new flu breakouts in six states. CIDRAP says infection recently struck a large farm housing 2.1 million poultry in Nebraska and at a commercial farm breeding 18,000 hens in Pennsylvania.“The way to contain this flu is unfortunate,” said William Schaffner, MD, an infectious disease specialist and professor of preventive medicine and health policy at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville, Tennessee. “What you do is actually kill a lot of poultry in order to prevent areas from becoming hot spots for bird flu.”Risk to Humans Remains LowDr. Schaffner noted that these bird viruses, fortunately, do not seem to attach efficiently to the cells we have in our upper airways, noses, and throats. And since they do not spread readily from bird to human, the viruses do not easily transmit from person to person either. He added that consumers also need not worry about getting the illness from consuming or touching store-bought eggs and chicken.Still, transmission is possible. CDC figures show that since 1997 more than 880 people worldwide have contracted HPAI and about half died from the disease. Symptoms can range from mild upper respiratory tract symptoms and lower respiratory tract disease to severe pneumonia with respiratory failure, encephalitis (inflammation of the brain), and multi-organ failure.Most who have gotten avian flu live with or work among poultry. “Some people may have job-related or recreational exposures to birds that put them at higher risk of infection,” writes the CDC.While not overly concerned about the human impact of this latest avian flu outbreak, public health officials are on the alert for mutations that could be more harmful to people. The 2009 H1N1 pandemic or swine flu outbreak originated in pigs, but scientists later found that the flu was a recombinant form of flu strains from birds and humans.The different types of flu viruses mixed within pigs, swapping genes and giving rise to a variant that could infect human cells and reproduce.“In this case, bird flu and human flu strains got together and exchanged genetic elements,” said Schaffner. “The pig acted as a kind of test tube and produced a new flu that could spread to humans. This happens rarely, but the world's influenza laboratory communities are constantly on the alert for that possibility.”As a general precaution, people are advised to avoid direct contact with wild birds and observe them only from a distance. Wild birds can be infected with bird flu viruses without appearing sick.Authorities in several states, including the Illinois Department of Natural Resources, have issued warnings urging the public to halt the use of bird feeders and bird baths until the spread of avian influenza subsides.Individuals should avoid poultry that appear ill or have die and avoid contact with surfaces that appear to be contaminated with feces from wild or domestic birds.Because flu viruses are constantly changing, CDC says it will continue to monitor these viruses to look for genetic or epidemiologic changes suggesting that they might spread more easily to and between people.Meet Our ExpertsSee Our Editorial PolicyMeet Our Health Expert NetworkDon RaufAuthorDon Rauf has been a freelance health writer for over 12 years and his writing has been featured in HealthDay, CBS News, WebMD, U.S. News & World Report, Mental Floss, United Press International (UPI), Health, and MedicineNet.

"They're very devoted to wild horses and the horses that are under their care."The BLM is mandated by federal law to manage “healthy horses on healthy (public) lands,” Hall said. Many of the horses that were falling ill and dying had been rounded up in the fall of last year from the rugged West Douglas area, west of the town of Meeker, in northwest Colorado, he said. Wildfires had reduced the forage available to the wild horses, which “will eat more than a cow in a month,” he said.The BLM "will review operations at the Canon City facility to prevent future outbreaks like this from occurring,” said BLM Colorado acting associate state director Ben Gruber.“This tragic outcome was influenced by a population of horses that may have been particularly vulnerable given their time in the West Douglas area and their exposure to last year’s wildfire that prompted their emergency gather.”U.S. Rep. Steve Cohen, D-Tenn., said at a hybrid hearing on Capitol Hill and online Wednesday about preventing pandemics through wildlife-borne disease surveillance, that 3.5% of the 2,550 horses at the Cañon City facility had died in less than a week.“These horses are kept in close quarters — if they were not penned, it is entirely possible that the pathogen would’ve not spread nearly as quickly,” Cohen said, calling wild horses a national treasure.More: Colorado suspends all poultry events after avian influenza is found in geesePhotographer Carol Walker, who has adopted a wild horse from the Cañon City facility, also said that holding the horses in crowded conditions “is very likely to cause disease.”“When they round them up, the horses have no natural immunity to diseases that affect domestic horses, such as strangles,” a highly contagious disease of the upper respiratory tract, she said."I think that if the horses hadn't been rounded up, they would still be healthy,” she saidWalker also questioned the standards of care for the horses at Cañon City, saying the horse she adopted there in August last year was "skin and bones.”"The care at that facility is terrible. It doesn't surprise me that something may have happened,” she said More: Colorado ranchers, veterinarians say Initiative 16 would 'devastate' agricultural economyVeterinarians are still at the facility, working with the BLM to "investigate and mitigate the factors that may be contributing to the most severe cases and prevent further spread of the disease," the BLM said."The facility remains under a voluntary quarantine with no horses allowed to leave the premises at this time and for the foreseeable future until it has been determined that the animals are again healthy and pose no risk to the domestic equine population in the community," it said.The American Wild Horse Campaign has called for “an immediate pause on the roundups and a full investigation into the BLM’s off-range wild horse holding system,” the advocacy group's director of government relations, Holly Gann Bice, said in a statement.

(Graham Hughes/The Canadian Press)Social SharingThis story was updated after it was published to include the opinions of other medical experts about the study in question.As the sixth pandemic wave has peaked in Quebec, the flu has returned to epidemic levels in the province after a lull of nearly two years. A team of Quebec researchers has studied how the influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2 virus interact. In the study published in February in the journal Viruses, the team of researchers from Université Laval in Quebec City, along with Swiss researcher Clément Fage, found that being infected with one of the viruses could help prevent infection with the other.Quebec to keep mask mandate in place until mid-MayThe findings are the results of lab tests and experts warn that results outside of a lab could differ. "The biggest caveat of this study, of course, is that it's just done with cells in a lab-based setting," said Dr. Matthew Miller, an associate professor of infectious diseases and immunology at McMaster University in Hamilton. "But I think it's an important step in the right direction."Miller noted that learning more about how other viruses interact with the one that causes COVID-19 has "very important public health implications," as more restrictions are lifted and those other viruses begin circulating again.Flu infections once again reached epidemic levels in early April, meaning the proportion of positive tests for the virus has surpassed five percent. It has now reached 11 per cent, a level typically seen in January and February in Quebec."It's very unusual to have a flu epidemic begin so late in the year," said Dr. Guy Boivin — one of the study's authors, and a microbiologist and infectious diseases specialist based at the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Québec, a network of teaching hospitals in Quebec City."We are in a situation that is completely out of the ordinary. The pandemic really upends all the theories we have about flu epidemics."The immunity provided by flu vaccines could be waning, too, as most were administered last fall, Boivin added.But Boivin believes the rise in influenza cases could have an impact on the number of COVID-19 cases in the coming weeks. "If our findings are confirmed at the population level, as the flu epidemic grows, we could see a decrease in the number of COVID-19 cases in the coming weeks," he told Radio-Canada.Co-infection rare but possible: studyAfter first infecting nasals cells with one virus, the researchers found it was a lot harder to infect them with the other, and vice versa.Boivin said the team's hypothesis is that, at a population level, the findings could mean the resurgence of the flu could contribute to a reduction in the number of COVID-19 cases in the coming weeks.Still, Boivin cautions, the negative effects the viruses had on each other in his study were not absolute.Dr. Guy Boivin, a microbiologist and infectious disease specialist at CHU de Québec, studies how the influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2 interact. (Radio-Canada)"Some people can still be co-infected by both viruses and we need to keep a close eye on that," he said, noting there have been cases reported in Europe and even recently in Quebec where people have been infected by the influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2 at the same time. A British study found that such "co-infections" can lead to symptoms that are more severe.The study — published in the International Journal of Epidemiology last summer and which has not yet been peer-reviewed — found that patients who had tested positive for both viruses were more likely to require hospitalization than those who had tested positive for only one of the viruses."We can expect harmful effects from being infected by both viruses simultaneously," Boivin said.'Healthy skepticism' requiredDr. Matthew Oughton, an infectious diseases specialist at Montreal's Jewish General Hospital, says the study in itself isn't broad enough to be able to predict the outcome of the sixth wave."There are some significant limitations before you could extrapolate this data toward a real-world setting," Oughton said, noting the researchers used only one strain of each virus, and that the strain of influenza used to infect the nasal cells in the lab, H1N1, was not the same as the one that has since come into circulation in Canada, H3N2. He agreed with Boivin that the immunity in the population against that strain of influenza has probably weakened since the flu vaccination campaign.Dr. Matthew Oughton said it's too soon to say whether the rise in influenza cases will have an effect on COVID-19 cases in Quebec. (CBC)But Oughton also noted that the warmer, moister weather may decrease the ease with which respiratory viruses circulate. "There's a lot of different factors happening at the same time. All this to say, to me, it means you have to be very careful in making predictions; you have to make predictions with a healthy skepticism," he said.All three infectious diseases specialists say loosening pandemic restrictions may be a factor in the unusually late flu epidemic.While COVID-19 has been considered more contagious and more dangerous for much of the pandemic, the flu can kill hundreds of people per year. In 2018, more than 1,000 Quebecers died after being infected with the virus. "The mortality rates are starting to look a lot more similar than they were earlier in the pandemic, when it was quite clear that SARS-CoV-2 was causing much higher mortality than we normally observe with seasonal influenza," said Miller. "During a pandemic, the mortality rate of a virus is generally intrinsically different from when it becomes endemic."First PersonAfter my near-death experience, I'm never neglecting to get the flu shotIn a news conference last Thursday, interim public health director Dr. Luc Boileau said people with flu symptoms should take the same precautions as they would for COVID-19 — including isolating for five days after the onset of symptoms, wearing a mask to minimize contaminating others, and avoiding public gatherings and people at increased risk for the following five days.With files from Radio-CanadaCBC's Journalistic Standards and Practices|About CBC NewsCorrections and clarifications|Submit a news tip|Report errorRelated Stories Quebec to keep mask mandate in place until mid-May COVID vs. flu — is it a fair comparison?

From the practice of “variolation” in the 15th century to messenger RNA vaccines today, immunization has a long and important history. The World Health Organization (WHO) has played an integral role, helping to reduce serious illnesses and save lives through global vaccination efforts in the 20th and 21st centuries.For World Immunization Week, WHO has teamed up with Google Arts & Culture and cultural and scientific institutions around the world to bring this history to life through the virtual installment, A brief history of vaccination.In Canada, Google partnered with Ingenium, Canada's Museums of Science and Innovation, to curate Canadian specific stories on the digital exhibit. Following the launch of the platform, Google has published several projects, including Vaccines made in Canada part 1, Vaccines made in Canada part 2 and A day in the life of a vaccine. The projects highlight how Canada has contributed to global vaccination efforts against diseases like diphtheria, smallpox, Spanish Flu and Polio.From insufflation to vaccinationVaccine discoveries really started to make an impact in the 20th century. During that time, smallpox was eradicated globally and vaccines for polio, measles, influenza, hepatitis B and many other diseases were developed. WHO was also officially established, along with its “Expanded Programme on Immunization,” which ensures that children around the world have access to life-saving vaccines. A brief history of vaccination shows these great advances through photos, archival footage and historic scientific documents shared by WHO and global cultural institutions.Through detailed stories from medical archives, you’ll discover how we arrived at today’s life-saving jabs. You’ll meet famous pioneers like Edward Jenner and Louis Pasteur, and learn about some of the earliest vaccine practices. In 15th-century China, for instance, people practiced “insufflation” — which involved blowing dried smallpox scabs into the nostril with a pipe. You’ll also discover the lesser-known stories of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, who introduced variolation (in the form of inoculation) in Europe in 1721, and the Grand Duke of Tuscany, who experimented with inoculation in the 18th century.Unfinished historyOf course, the battle against infectious diseases continues. During the COVID-19 pandemic, new stories of ingenuity and resilience against the odds have emerged. The collection features the heroism of Spanish and British healthcare workers during COVID-19, and Ganesh Bhatt who became a one-man ambulance service in the remote mountain villages of northern India.As communities around the world have attempted to contain the pandemic, it’s become even clearer that education is key to any successful vaccination program. With this in mind, parents and teachers can download Google Arts & Culture’s lesson plan with helpful information about the history of vaccination.Through A brief history of vaccination, we learn, above everything, that our fight against infectious diseases has united people across continents and cultures.

Outside organizations, including animal rights groups Animal Outlook and Direct Action Everywhere, have decried the factory’s method of containing the outbreak because of the extreme animal suffering caused by the ventilation shutdown plus culling method. VSD+ is a process where the air is closed off to the barns and chicken coops, and heat is introduced to the environment until temperatures rise above 104F (40C), causing the chickens to gradually die from heat suffocation. James Roth, director of the Center for Food Security and Public Health at Iowa State University’s College of Veterinary Medicine told The Guardian, “Nobody wants to see it used, but sometimes it is, as a last resort. The rationale is if the influenza virus spreads so fast that it’ll go through a poultry house really rapidly, all of those birds produce massive amounts of virus in the air. Then you have a big plume of virus coming from that house that spreads to other poultry houses. It’s critical to get the birds euthanized before that virus becomes a huge plume of virus to spread.” Under fire, too, are the factory’s actions in managing its laborers and supervisors. Overnight, their duties were transitioned to disposal of the chickens and hens. At the end of the month spent on the task, they were fired. “Right now everybody’s worried about the chickens,” said Oscar Garcia, a former supervisor at the plant. “We get it: it was really inhumane the way they killed them. But chickens are chickens, right? People worked in those barns pulling out dead birds in terrible conditions, feces everywhere, doing 12- or 14-hour days.” Another report, by Bloomberg, notes the avian flu epidemic has driven the price of breaker eggs, eggs processed into either liquid or powders, to record highs.

Health authorities in Colorado reported the first U.S. case of a human infected with the bird flu H5 virus this week as the country as a whole faces a huge bird flu outbreak across poultry farms.The person infected, described as an adult male younger than 40 who was working at a farm with infected poultry, is said to be largely asymptomatic and experiencing only fatigue, the Colorado Department of Public Health & Environment (CDPHE) said on Thursday.The man's reported infection was detected in a single nasal sample. The CDPHE noted it is possible that the virus may have been present in the man's nose without causing infection simply due to his close proximity with infected birds. Still, he is now isolating and is receiving an antiviral flu drug. The affected bird flock was killed. A chicken farm in Osage, Iowa, in August, 2014.

Bird flu can spread quickly through poultry farms, resulting in millions of birds being killed. Scott Olson/Getty What is H5 bird flu?The H5 bird flu virus is also known as Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) A H5 and a few different subtypes have been reported in the U.S., known as H5N1, H5N2, and H5N8.H5 bird flu can be highly infectious, spreading through flocks of birds and infecting their respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. The virus has a high mortality rate in infected poultry, though outbreaks often result in millions of birds being killed anyway by farmers to prevent it from spreading.In birds, symptoms of HPAI infections may include sudden death; lack of energy, appetite, and coordination; purple discoloration or swelling of various body parts; diarrhea; nasal discharge; coughing; sneezing; and reduced egg production, or soft-shelled or misshapen eggs, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Risk of infection may increase with exposure to infected birds.Human-to-human transmission of bird flu in general is described by the CDC as "very rare", though it has happened. Due to the possibility that the viruses could evolve to better spread between people, the agency states that monitoring for person-to-person spread is "extremely important for public health."The current U.S. bird flu epidemicThe U.S. is currently experiencing a large outbreak of HPAI bird flu that has been confirmed in 29 states and affected more than 33 million birds, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture on April 27."Highly pathogenic avian influenza is a serious concern for our nation's poultry industry, and we need to continue our nationwide response to minimize the impact," said USDA Under Secretary for Marketing and Regulatory Programs Jenny Lester Moffitt in an agency press release.

Posted by Kelly Kizer Whitt and Deborah Byrd and April 25, 2022 Bird flu confirmed locations. The blue states denote locations where the USDA has confirmed HPAI (bird flu) in commercial and backyard poultry flocks between April 1 and 16, 2022. Data via USDA. Image via Kelly Whitt. A severe strain of bird flu A highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) – or especially severe bird flu – is causing sickness among both domestic and wild birds across the United States. And experts originally said it was necessary to take down your bird feeders and bird baths, to help stop the spread. The Raptor Center at the University of Minnesota tweeted on April 19, 2022, recommending that people in U.S. states with HPAI take bird feeders down for a couple of months this spring, to help decrease the spread of this virus. But then, on April 24, the Cornell Lab of Ornithology – home institution of some of the nation’s greatest experts on songbirds – clarified on Facebook that the risk to songbirds is low. The Cornell Lab had said on April 20 that – unless you keep domestic poultry – you probably don’t have to worry about taking down feeders in your yard. The greatest known risk from this virus – so far – is to chickens, turkeys, and other poultry. So you wouldn’t want to invite any bird that might be carrying the bird flu to get close to your chicken coop, the Lab said. Due to the current outbreak of the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI), the University of Minnesota's Raptor Center recommends that you take down your bird feeders this spring to slow the spread from bird to bird.

According to USDA, removing bird feeders is not a recommendation at present unless you also keep poultry. Full article: https:/.co/B8ItPLRG2J — Cornell Lab (@CornellBirds) April 24, 2022 Humans not at risk This avian influenza does not pose any risk to humans, and there are no human cases of avian influenza viruses in the United States. But the virus can be deadly in some birds. The U.S. Geological Survey reported that HPAI viruses, including the current strain named H5N1, do cause high mortality in poultry and occasionally have been known to cause high death rates in certain species of wild birds. Waterfowl, shorebirds and seabirds are most likely to carry and shed the virus without showing signs of illness. Raptors, such as eagles, owls and hawks, are the most likely to get sick quickly and die from the virus. So you can see why The Raptor Center was originally so concerned about being careful. However, the effect on songbirds is less well known. That’s because this group has fewer studies and monitoring.

Bird flu in poultry This spring, the virus has been turning up in poultry populations across the country. In Pennsylvania, one commercial operation with almost 1 1/2 million chickens identified HPAI in their flock, resulting in a 6-mile (10-kilometer) quarantine. Pennsylvania Agriculture Secretary Russell Redding said that there is no concern for humans. He also said: However, wild birds carry the virus and do not respect property or state lines. The Conversation reported that, as of early April, the H5N1 outbreak caused the culling of some 23 million domesticated chickens and turkeys from Maine to Wyoming. Bird flu in raptors, waterfowl and other birds The Raptor Center is monitoring their local wildlife populations for positive cases of avian influenza in what they call an “unprecedented outbreak” in the U.S. All birds are susceptible to HPAI, though they may not show symptoms. Birds pass on this virus to others through feces and respiratory secretions. Furthermore, the cold doesn’t stop it. The virus can survive for weeks in cool, damp environments. Victoria Hall of The Raptor Center said: The 2022 outbreak is unique because of the very high levels of transmission of the currently circulating H5N1 virus strain in wildlife. With minimal viral surveillance being done with songbirds, it is hard to measure the risk of transmission from songbirds to other birds. The Raptor Center is testing birds such as bald eagles and owls every day for HPAI. HPAI produces intense suffering from fatal neurological illness in these birds. At the moment, euthanasia is the only tool people have to help the birds. Dana Franzen-Klein of The Raptor Center holds an eagle after testing it for HPAI. Image via University of Minnesota. How you can help birds The researchers at The Raptor Center originally recommended pausing the use of bird feeders and bird baths to keep birds from congregating in these locations and spreading the virus. Their feeling was that – since they don’t have all the data – taking that step would at least slow the transmission if at all possible. As Hall said: Because the science is unclear on the role of songbirds in this current H5N1 outbreak, one consideration is to not encourage birds to gather together at places such as bird feeders or bird baths. These are places where things like viruses could easily be exchanged between individuals. But the Cornell Lab said the next day: There is currently very low risk of an outbreak among wild songbirds, and no official recommendation to take down feeders unless you also keep domestic poultry, according to the National Wildlife Disease Program. We do always recommend that you clean bird feeders and birdbaths regularly as a way to keep many kinds of diseases at bay. We will update this page as the situation develops.

Bottom line: A highly pathogenic avian influenza is spreading among U.S. birds. Researchers originally recommended taking down bird feeders and baths for a couple of months, then clarified that this step is primarily necessary if you keep poultry.

For an added perspective on the figures and trends percentage, country sentinel sites reporting for WKs 15 & 16 are also shown. Actual increase in the number of ILI cases is seen in Kiribati and Fiji. The increase seen in New Caledonia and FSM may be due to the increased number of sites reported for the week. A reduction of ILI cases were seen in CNMI for the week. No changes were seen to the number of ILI cases in Palau for the week. Nil ILI cases were reported for the week from the Cook Islands, Niue, Pitcairn Islands, RMI and Tokelau No reports were available from French Polynesia, Solomon Islands, Wallis & Futuna, Tonga, Vanuatu, Tuvalu, and Samoa for the week. American Samoa, Guam and Nauru have not participated in the surveillance. Surveillance figures are not intended to capture all country cases but to describe trends over time and are invaluable when trends rise beyond country baselines which should then trigger alerts and timely actions to characterize the actual nature and magnitude of the disease.

An outbreak of Avian Influenza has been confirmed at a premises near Ilkeston, Erewash, Derbyshire. 3km and 10km temporary control zone measures have been put in place around the infected premises to limit the risk of the disease spreading. Derby City Council’s Trading Standards Officers are working closely with Emergency Planning colleagues to help contain and control the spread of the disease. Derby City currently falls within the 10km surveillance zone. As such, road signs will be displayed warning the public of the affected areas. Within the 3km and 10km zones, a range of controls are now in place to prevent the spread of disease. These include restrictions on the movement of poultry and other captive birds, carcasses, eggs, used poultry litter and manure. It is a legal requirement that all keepers of birds in these zones must follow increased measures while the restrictions are in place. Further details on the restrictions are available via the Government website. An Avian Influenza Prevention Zone (AIPZ) is now in force across Great Britain to mitigate the risk of the disease spreading amongst poultry and captive birds. This means most bird keepers across the country must: Keep domestic ducks and geese separate from other poultry; Ensure the areas where birds are kept are unattractive to wild birds, for example by netting ponds, and by removing wild bird food sources; Feed and water their birds in enclosed areas to discourage wild birds; Minimise movement into and out of bird enclosures; Cleanse and disinfect footwear and keep areas where birds live clean and tidy; Reduce any existing contamination by cleansing and disinfecting concrete areas, and fencing off wet or boggy areas; Keep free ranging birds within fenced areas, and ponds, watercourses and permanent standing water must be fenced off (except in specific circumstances, e.g. zoo birds). Avian influenza (bird flu) is a notifiable animal disease. Anyone suspecting any type of avian influenza in poultry or captive birds must report it immediately by calling the Defra Rural Services Helpline on 03000 200 301. Failure to do so is an offence. If anyone finds dead wild waterfowl (swans, geese or ducks) or other dead wild birds, such as gulls or birds of prey, they should report them to the Defra helpline (03459 33 55 77 - please select option 7). Avian Influenza restrictions are regularly subject to change, for up to date information please visit the Government website.

The patient is a four-year-old boy who had been in contact with chickens and crows in his home in the Henan province. The child was tested after developing fever and other symptoms earlier this month. No close contacts were infected with the virus, the National Health Commission (NHC) said in a statement. The H3N8 variant has previously been detected in other parts of the world in horses, dogs, birds, and seals, but no human cases of H3N8 have been reported, the NHC said. The commission said an initial assessment determined that the variant could not yet effectively infect humans and that the risk of a large-scale epidemic was low. Many different strains of avian influenza are present in China and some sporadically infect people, usually those who work with poultry. Last year China reported the first human case of H10N3. The country has huge populations of wild and farmed birds which creates an optimal environment for avian viruses to mix and mutate. To add to China's hardships and with Shanghai's port already closed due to sanitary restrictions imposed in pursuit of a Zero-COVID policy, fishing vessels ships anchored in sea waters near Macao caught fire Monday evening, the Fire Department of the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR) Government reported. The cause of the fire and casualties remain unclear, the authorities explained. Categories: Health & Science, International. Tags: avian influenza, China, H3N8.

With the Ministry's declaration, additional sanitary measures regarding detection and control of the disease can be implemented by the affected jurisdictions. The authorities decided on the declaration after 22 cases of this virus and one death were reported in a Peruvian Army unit in South Lima, coupled with an increasing number of acute respiratory infections (ARI). The Ministry of Health also said it was implementing control measures to identify new suspected cases. Minsa's National Center for Epidemiology, Prevention and Disease Control (CDC) also issued a series of tips to prevent the spread of the virus and reported that infection control and timely epidemiological surveillance will be strengthened in public and private establishments nationwide. The recommendations include the identification of cases of severe or unusual acute respiratory infections, the monitoring of the increase of cases or outbreaks of acute respiratory infection in populations living in closed spaces such as military barracks, shelters, prisons, schools, nursing homes, and cradles. Other measures consist of vaccination against Influenza, and compliance with biosecurity guidelines - the correct use of facemasks, hand washing, and adequate ventilation of closed spaces, among others. The Influenza virus is spread through droplets produced by coughing, sneezing, laughing, singing, or talking. These droplets can fall into the mouth or nose of people nearby. Influenza is also contracted through contaminated hands. Signs of ARI include sudden fever, cough, and/or a sore throat, together with muscle pain and headache. Annual vaccination against influenza is the first and most important step to protect against influenza viruses, health experts insisted. Categories: Health & Science, Latin America.

Canadians are anecdotally reporting catching the flu or even a stomach virus soon after recovering from COVID-19, making them wonder if their immune system has been weakened.An immunologist and York University professor says it’s a fair assumption.“The reason people are interested in this is that there was this initial fear that ‘Oh we’re going to have a twindemic‘ – the flu plus COVID. But that never materialized,” Ali Abdul-Sater told Global News via Zoom.That means the country did not see an alarming spike in flu cases during this season … and some health experts suspect that may have a lot more to do with masking and physical distancing as opposed to the strength of people’s immune systems. Story continues below advertisement Still, many say they got a bad case of sniffles following COVID. Dr. Doug Manuel said that is probably an outcome of being cooped up at home for a long time, and those masks coming off.“We are concerned that we have now had a few years where people haven’t been exposed to RSV or influenza, and so now our immunity is a little bit lower for those,” the director of the Wastewater Surveillance Group with CoVaRR-Net, and senior scientist with The Ottawa Hospital told Global.lowered immune system as part of long covid is no joke. this is the second time i caught a flu and fever after recovering from covid last month, despite already amping up my vitamin intake to boost my immunity. this is an unsolicited tweet to appreciate your health okay bye— Miss Atomic Bomb (@SyarifahAmin) April 19, 2022Does that mean the weakened immune system theory is completely out the window?

Abdul-Sater says weakened immunity post-disease is something that is widely studied, but has been vaguely looked at with MERS and other coronaviruses.Some literature suggests a decreased level of lymphocyte immune cells following an infection. However, another kind of immune cells – innate cells – shoots up.This doesn’t necessarily suggest your immune system is either weaker or stronger, Abdul-Sater said. Complex factors such as age and the severity of the disease have to be taken into account.“Short-lived infections generally don’t tend to cause significant or long-term dysfunction to the immune system. But viruses that cause chronic infections – so hepatitis C, hepatitis B, HIV – certainly cause significant dysfunction,” he said.Despite this, Manuel said scientists are “open-minded” to the idea that COVID-19 may actually be debilitating to the immune system. 2:11 Montreal study to examine long-term effects of COVID-19 Trending Now 6.8 magnitude earthquake shakes Cuba after hurricanes and blackouts Canada may need to let Trump be ‘senior partner’ in U.S. relations: GOP critic While also questionable due to limited studies, there is literature that suggests COVID-19 may cause ‘immune dysregulation’ similar to how HIV and hepatitis C do.

But for those with more serious infections, the SARS-CoV-2 virus is proving to be far worse. Patients hospitalized with COVID-19 are three times more likely to die than those admitted with flu, according to new research. The study, was conducted during the first wave of the pandemic by researchers at the Hospital del Mar in Barcelona, Spain. Researchers conclude that adults in the hospital with COVID-19 face triple the risk of death within 30 days and 90 days versus patients under treatment for seasonal influenza. People aged 18 or over admitted with the virus were also at higher risk of complications and dying than those with flu, despite being younger and having fewer chronic illnesses. The findings also suggest that COVID-19 is associated with both longer stays in hospital and intensive care, and costs nearly twice as much to treat as flu. For the study, researchers examined the medical records of 187 patients with an average age of 76 admitted to hospital with seasonal flu between 2017 and 2019. Data was compared to the records of 187 COVID patients, average age 67, hospitalized during the first wave of the pandemic between March and May, 2020. All of the COVID patients required oxygen therapy at admission. Flu patients tended to have more existing chronic illnesses and problems performing daily activities than COVID patients, but were less likely to be overweight or have obesity. The analysis shows that Covid-19 was associated with a higher risk of infection severity and admission to intensive care. COVID patients were also more likely to experience certain complications including acute kidney injury, blood clots, and moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, where the lungs cannot provide the body’s vital organs with enough oxygen. Flu patients were more likely to suffer from bacterial pneumonia. Overall, 15 percent of the COVID patients died compared to just 5 percent of the flu patient within 30 days of being admitted to hospital. The death rate after 90 days was even higher among COVID patients (19 percent) than flu patients (6 percent). Further analysis shows that COVID patients spent far longer in hospital than flu patients. The average cost of critical care for COVID patients (about $23,000) was almost twice as much as for flu patients (about $13,000). Pharmacy treatment and testing costs were also “significantly higher” in the coronavirus group. “Our findings suggest COVID-19 is far more lethal than influenza. Despite influenza patients being older and having more comorbid illnesses, COVID-19 patients had consistently worse health outcomes and were considerably more expensive to treat,” says study lead author Dr. Inmaculada Lopez Montesinos in a statement. “Even for those people who are lucky enough to survive COVID-19 and make it out of the hospital, they will be forever scarred by the consequences. It is vital that people get fully vaccinated and boosted against both viruses.” The findings were presented at the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ECCMID 2022) in Lisbon, Portugal.

Before that it was detected in horses in the 1960s and 70s.FITPublished: 27 Apr 2022, 10:48 AM ISTFitiAaAaSmallAaMediumAaLargeThe first ever human case of H3N8 avian flu was confirmed in China on Tuesday, 26 April. While H3N8 avian flu can infect horses, ducks, seals, dogs, and cats, authorities say that the chances of human infection and transmission are low.H3N8 avian influenza was first recorded in 2002 in North American waterfowl like ducks, geese, and swans. H3N8 is a virus endemic to horses(predominantly) and birds and has been traced as far back as 1978 in horses. H3N8 primarily infects horses with a condition called equine influenza.While H3N8 is highly transmissible in some animals, this is the first ever reported and confirmed case of a human being infected with H3N8.According to China's National Health Commission, a four-year-old boy from the Henan province tested positive for H3N8 after he was hospitalised earlier in April with a fever.ADVERTISEMENTREMOVE AD"The boy was infected directly by birds. His family raised chickens and they lived in a place populated by ducks. The strain doesn't have the ability to effectively infect humans."National Health Commission, ChinaThe NHC also stated that it ran tests on the patient's family and closest contacts and detected no abnormalities. "This appears to be a one-off instance of cross-species transmission of H3N8. Large-scale transmission risk is extremely low," they added.Regardless of this statement, it issued a caution to the public to avoid dead birds and contact a doctor immediately if they experience a fever or other respiratory symptoms.Also ReadBird Flu Resurgence in France and the US: What Is Avian Virus?

(Dimas Ardian/Getty Images)Social SharingAlberta poultry producers are bracing for more outbreaks of a highly transmissible and deadly variant of avian flu that has already taken a toll on flocks in the province.The highly pathogenic avian influenza strain H5N1, which is spreading quickly across Canada, has been detected at 18 Alberta poultry operations since the province's first case was confirmed in Mountain View County on April 6.Cases have been detected in two small flocks and 16 commercial flocks in Alberta, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) said Tuesday.As of April 21, 12 Alberta flocks had active outbreaks, accounting for an estimated 340,000 infected birds — the most in any province.'Incredibly stressful'As cases continue to multiply, bird farmers are bracing for losses and doing what they can to keep the infection out of their barns."It's an incredibly stressful time," said David Hyink, a poultry farmer who operates a broiler chicken operation near Lacombe, Alta., 125 kilometres south of Edmonton."We're being very vigilant."Hyink inspects his four barns daily for signs of disease among his 135,000 chickens.Most forms of avian flu are mild but the H5N1 strain can cause serious disease and death in wild and domestic birds.The disease is not considered a significant concern for humans but infections can wipe out a flock in a matter of days.With no treatment, an entire flock must be culled to ensure the infection is contained."It's a very dangerous disease for birds," said Hyink, who also serves as chair of the Alberta Chicken Producers, the organization that regulates broiler chicken production in the province. "Once it gets into the flock, it'll spread rapidly. It'll cause major mortality in the barns."In some cases, hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of birds would need to be destroyed." Food industry adjusting to large outbreak of avian flu in Canada, around the world1st case of avian flu discovered in Manitoba commercial poultry flockThe CFIA says 2022 has been unprecedented for the spread of avian flu around the world.Migratory birds are believed responsible for a string of outbreaks across Canada. As wild birds continue to fly north for summer, more cases are expected.Outbreaks have also been confirmed on poultry farms in British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador. No cases have been detected in humans in North America. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency is investigating outbreaks of avian flu at dozens of poultry farms across Canada (Submitted by David Hyink)The CFIA has found no proof of farm-to-farm transmission but more research is needed, said Jeff Notenbomer, who owns Willow Creek Poultry, a broiler-breeding operation in Monarch, Alta., near Lethbridge.He is also chair of Alberta Hatching Egg Producers, which regulates the production of broiler hatching in the province.Notenbomer said he had hoped that biosecurity protocols and the distance between most Alberta farms would provide a safety net against infection. "We are seeing it spread a lot quicker than we were expecting," he said. "That is making us very nervous. How is it spreading? How is it hopping from barn to barn?" Notenbomer compares the spike in avian flu cases to the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, when cases were surging, protocols were being strictly enforced and the source of transmission was unclear. "I think we need to see two weeks without a positive [case] before I'll take a deep breath." The Canadian Food Inspection Agency says migrating wild birds are likely responsible for the spread of the flu. (Lindsey Baumanhe Hutchinson News via Associated Press)Operators are eligible for compensation for culled birds based on market value. But the formula does not account for the downtime faced by farmers following an outbreak, Notenbomer said. Notenbomer's farm has around 25,000 chickens and produces about 3.5 million fertilized eggs each year. Hatcheries like his would take up to two years to reach full production again, he said.Quebec duck farm says it must kill 150,000 birds, lay off 300 staff due to bird fluBird flu confirmed at South Glengarry poultry farmOutbreaks have led to supply chain issues, import restrictions and soaring prices elsewhere but it is not clear if the current outbreaks will impact Canadian consumers.Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada says many factors are inflating food prices so it's difficult to find a direct link between the virus and costs for eggs and poultry.Notenbomer said the Canadian industry should be better equipped to absorb the shock of any disruptions due to support provided by the country's supply chain management system."When a farm does go down, everything is in place to make the adjustments necessary to keep going but the more cases there are, the harder that gets," he said."The supply is stable but I am nervous because it seems to be spreading."Avian flu suspected as B.C. farmer loses 80% of chickens in 4 days; new cases identified in Kelowna flockHand-feeding of chickadees banned near Saskatoon as avian flu spreadsAvian influenza is a reportable disease in Canada.

In Malaysia, flu vaccinations are only offered by private clinics and hospitals. nfid.org Prof. Datuk Dr Zulkifli Ismail. Prof Dr Tan Maw Pin. Prof Dr Chan Siew Pheng. By Muhammad Basir Roslan KUALA LUMPUR (Bernama) – As Malaysia transitions to the endemic phase of COVID-19, one big question arises – should we be concerned over the return of influenza? Influenza, commonly known as the flu, is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses and it can be a serious health threat to high-risk groups such as pregnant women, young children, people with chronic health conditions and the elderly. The flu usually occurs all year round in Malaysia and occasionally causes outbreaks, some of which can be major. As shown by the COVID-19 pandemic, respiratory diseases usually hit senior citizens the hardest. Older persons especially those with chronic conditions are at higher risk of developing severe flu and life-threatening complications which may require hospitalisation or intensive care in some cases. SPIKE IN FLU CASES Prof. Datuk Dr Zulkifli Ismail. According to consultant paediatrician and paediatric cardiologist at KPJ Selangor Specialist Hospital Professor Datuk Dr Zulkifli Ismail, the flu virus is now “making a tenacious comeback” after having practically vanished when the COVID-19 pandemic hit the nation. Besides Malaysia, other countries have also been reporting a spike in flu cases in recent months, he said. He also voiced his concern over the anticipated increase in flu activity following the reopening of Malaysia’s international borders and other sectors as more people will be travelling and mingling freely. The upcoming Hari Raya celebrations, which will include family gatherings and open houses, may also contribute to increased flu activity, he added. “When this happens, most people will be somewhat defenceless as they are not vaccinated against the flu. The fact that flu viruses have not been circulating in the last two years compounds the problem because the population’s immunity (against the flu) will be low,” he told Bernama. Dr Zulkifli, who is chairman of the Immunise4Life (IFL) Technical Committee, also said that many Malaysians often confuse the flu with the common cold or perceive it as a winter illness that only happens in temperate countries. “Both notions are not correct,” he pointed out. HIGHLY VULNERABLE Prof Dr Tan Maw Pin. Meanwhile, Dr Tan Maw Pin, a professor in geriatric medicine at Universiti Malaya (UM) shared some alarming data on the flu. Quoting a recent study published by The Lancet, she said adults with both the flu and COVID-19 were four times more likely to receive invasive mechanical ventilation while their risk of death was doubled. She said another recent study showed that seven out of 10 people aged above 65 who contract the flu have a higher risk of developing complications such as pneumonia, inflammation of the brain, multi-organ failure and sepsis (extreme immune system response to infection). “Their weakened immune system and declining lung function increase the likelihood of catching the flu, getting hospitalised and probably dying from the disease. Yet, many families are not even aware when their aged parents or grandparents have the flu,” she said. Dr Tan said the disease also tends to present with atypical symptoms in older people. These include dizziness that may result in falls, and confusion or delirium with or without a fever. “Rapid breathing reveals oxygen insufficiency and may contribute to dehydration. Without treatment, severe flu and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) may set in,” she added. A DEADLY COMBINATION Prof Dr Chan Siew Pheng. Honorary professor at UM’s Department of Medicine Dr Chan Siew Pheng said diabetes can also significantly exacerbate the flu, adding that persistently high blood glucose can suppress the immune system and increase the frequency and duration of flu infections. “Many people with diabetes also have other co-morbidities such as high blood pressure and kidney disease; these only heighten the likelihood of serious flu complications,” the consultant endocrinologist said, adding that over 40 percent of Malaysians aged 60 and above are living with type 2 diabetes. She explained that the flu can make it even harder for them to control their diabetes, thus causing blood glucose levels to rise. “The flu may also reduce their appetite and food intake, causing blood glucose levels to fall. Their worsening condition may also result in life-threatening diabetes emergencies,” she added. Dr Chan, who is also president of the Malaysian Endocrine & Metabolic Society, said besides diabetics, people with heart disease also face a higher risk of developing complications – they are six times more likely to have a heart attack after coming down with the flu. “More surprisingly, it is now clear that flu infection increases the risk of a heart attack and a stroke by up to 10 times and eight times respectively in individuals without a history of cardiovascular disease,” she added. DEVASTATING In Malaysia, flu vaccinations are only offered by private clinics and hospitals. nfid.org Dr Zulkifli, meanwhile, said the flu can have devastating consequences on older persons as well as their families. This can happen when aged parents are admitted to the hospital and their children have to bear the cost of treatments. Should recovery be slow and long, caregivers may need to take time off from work, which will create hardship for the families, especially those from the lower-income brackets. “Older adults who are hospitalised or confined to prolonged bed rest may suffer bed sores, lose their muscle strength, develop irreversible functional decline and lose their ability to perform simple daily tasks. Losing their independence and becoming a burden to their loved ones would leave them depressed and utterly deprived of the quality of life they deserve,” he said. He said financial and emotional distress can be avoided by making flu prevention a part of the healthy ageing journey. “Hence, the most effective way to prevent the flu is by getting the annual flu shot. This is especially important for older persons, as it will help reduce the risk of severe disease and hospitalisation associated with the disease,” he said. Statistically, the flu shot can reduce the severity of symptoms, while also reducing the risk of major cardiovascular events by 36 percent, the risk of hospitalisation by 45 percent and the risk of death by 42 percent, according to Dr Zulkifli. “As of now, MOH (Ministry of Health) does not have any flu vaccination programme. We hope that this will change in the future starting with annual flu vaccinations for the elderly and those with co-morbidities. “At the moment, flu vaccination is given by private medical practitioners in clinics and private hospitals,” he added.

April 25, 2022 (Mainichi Japan) Japanese version Oral antiviral medication Avigan pills developed by Fujifilm Toyama Chemical Co. are seen in this image from the company website. TOKYO -- The 17.5-billion-yen (about $136-million) stockpile of the antiviral drug Favipiravir, known in Japan under the trade name Avigan, is likely to go unused as a COVID-19 treatment as its efficacy against the disease remains unconfirmed. The oral antiviral Avigan was developed by Tokyo-based Fujifilm Toyama Chemical Co. The Japanese government approved the drug's production and sale in 2014 to treat novel influenza after confirming that the medication helped curb the reproduction of flu viruses after they enter a cell. The government decided at the time that it would stockpile Avigan doses for up to some 2 million people in case other influenza medication such as Tamiflu didn't work during an epidemic. Following the coronavirus's initial spread in Japan, Fujifilm Toyama Chemical started a clinical trial in March 2020, hypothesizing that Avigan's efficacy against influenza could mean it would be effective against the coronavirus as well. In May that year, then Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said that his government would aim for the drug's approval for use against COVID-19 "by the end of the month." However, clinical trials have failed to prove Avigan is effective against the coronavirus. A health ministry committee meeting in December 2020 concluded that it was "difficult to clearly judge whether it (Avigan) is effective," and that the clinical review would continue. As the pandemic showed no sign of slowing, however, the government decided to stockpile doses for an additional 2 million people by the end of March 2021, claiming that, though it was not approved to treat the disease, the drug was needed as a crisis management measure. In this Feb. 27, 2020, file photo, then Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, center, is seen during a government coronavirus task force meeting at the prime minister's office in Tokyo. (Mainichi/Masahiro Kawata) The already acquired doses for 2 million novel influenza patients would convert into doses for 700,000 COVID-19 patients when considering the dosage and required period. In addition to spending 15.9 billion yen (approx. $124 million) to buy 1.3 million patients-worth of Avigan, the Japanese government poured 1.5 billion yen (roughly $12 million) of taxpayer money into Fujifilm Toyama Chemical to help cover clinical trial costs. In April 2021, the company resumed clinical research to examine the drug's efficacy to prevent severe COVID-19. But due to many minor cases amid the spread of the omicron variant, it was difficult to secure enough patients to conduct clinical trials, and the firm has since terminated the testing. Meanwhile, some university hospitals continued to carry out observation studies on Avigan until December 2021, in which they collect data after administering the medication to patients with consent. Since other oral drugs such as Molnupiravir developed by U.S. pharmaceutical firm Merck & Co. and sold under the trade name Lagevrio have become available for practical use, these studies have since been halted. Currently, Avigan is believed to be used rarely, if ever, to treat COVID-19. Some in Japanese medical circles initially suspected that the process to approve Avigan was "rigged" as Abe has a close tie with Shigetaka Komori, executive advisor to Fujifilm Toyama Chemical's parent company Fujifilm Holdings Corp. and the then prime minister repeated comments that could be taken as the approval was a given. In the end, however, the drug's efficacy was not scientifically proven and it failed to acquire approval. A health ministry official didn't disclose how the stockpiled Avigan would be used, but told the Mainichi Shimbun, "We want to mull over the matter after the company's analysis data (becomes available)." Many in the ministry apparently believe that the stockpile would be redesignated as a reserve for an influenza outbreak. One pharmaceutical industry source also defended the stockpile, saying that it would "not go to waste." However, how the stockpiled drugs will be used remains undecided.

IANS | Washington | April 29, 2022 1:49 pm Photo: IANS The US has confirmed the first known human case of H5 bird flu in a person in the state of Colorado, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced. The person tested positive for the avian influenza A (H5) virus and was involved in the culling of poultry presumed to have had H5N1 bird flu, Xinhua news agency quoted the CDC as saying on Thursday. The patient reported fatigue for a few days as the only symptom and has since recovered. Advertisement According to the CDC, the patient is being isolated and treated with the influenza antiviral drug oseltamivir. “This case does not change the human risk assessment for the general public, which CDC considers to be low,” the health agency said. CDC has been monitoring for illness among people exposed to H5N1 virus-infected birds since these outbreaks were detected in wild birds and poultry since late 2021. To date, H5N1 viruses have been found in commercial and backyard birds in 29 states and in wild birds in 34 states, according to the CDC. The agency has tracked the health of more than 2,500 people with exposure to H5N1 virus-infected birds and this is the only human case that has been found to date. It is the second human case worldwide associated with this specific group of H5 viruses that are currently predominant. The first case was reported in Britain in December 2021.

The recent H5N1 avian influenza epidemic was first detected in Europe last year, and has since spread to Canada in recent months. Bird flu has now been detected in almost all Canadian provinces. According to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, at least 1,372,400 birds in commercial farms and backyard flocks have been impacted by bird flu. It’s not exactly clear how many of these birds have been killed, but it’s safe to assume that most birds who were impacted by the virus would have been slaughtered. Recent news reports confirm that at least 184,000 birds have been killed in Ontario, 160,000 in Alberta, and another 150,000 birds are set to be killed in Quebec. Most of these birds were likely just babies—chickens raised for meat are slaughtered at six to eight weeks of age. #BirdFlu continues to ravage farms across the country, & has resulted in the recent heartbreaking deaths of hundreds of thousands of birds. We desperately need to stop factory farming to protect public health & to spare animals from needless suffering.https:/.co/GzK8uXx1Kg — Animal Justice (@AnimalJustice) April 12, 2022 While bird flu occurs in the wild, it incubates and spreads quickly on factory farms. In Canada, and in much of the developed world, the vast majority of modern chicken, duck, and turkey farms are massive-scale, industrialized operations, where thousands of birds are forced to live in cramped, filthy conditions. One barn at a chicken farm can be filled with tens of thousands of birds. When a bird flu outbreak occurs on a farm, farmers often mass kill their entire flock, in a process known as farm “depopulation”. But how does a farmer kill thousands of birds at once? On large farms in Canada, depopulation is usually achieved through the form of C02 gassing, which studies have shown can be incredibly painful for animals. On smaller farms, farmers can perform “cervical dislocation”—which involves killing a bird by violently snapping their neck. Image by Stefano Belacchi / We Animals Media Like most farming practices, mass culls happen behind closed doors, away from public view. The cruel methods that are typically used to kill entire barns full of animals are considered legal in Canada, falling under the animal welfare law exemption for “standard farming practices”. Other standard farming practices that are exempt from animal protection laws include slicing off birds’ beaks without anesthetic, confining gentle hens in battery cages that are so small, they can’t spread their wings, and tossing live newborn male chicks into macerators because they can’t lay eggs. On modern farms, birds and other animals endure heartbreaking suffering that would be considered illegal if done to a cat or a dog. And when it comes to bird flu, it’s not just animals who are at risk. Bird flu outbreaks in factory farms could allow the disease to mutate and more easily be passed onto the human population. Bird flu has caused several epidemics in recent history, causing illness and death in people in Europe, Africa, Asia, the Pacific, and the Middle East. The first human case of avian influenza A(H5) virus has just been detected in a person in Colorado, who helped cull farmed birds who were presumed to have H5N1. China also recently detected the first human case of the H3N8 bird flu strain, with a four-year-old boy infected after being in contact with chickens and crows.

The order prohibits birds from being taken to and appearing in shows, auctions, agricultural fairs and any other events where birds would be brought together from multiple locations.That order is in effect until May 14.The provincial government said there isn’t any risk to food safety and the risk of transmission is low. However, people working with chickens suspected of being infected should use protective clothing.The province said biosecurity is the best tool for poultry producers and small flock owners to protect their birds from avian flu. Biosecurity protocols include keeping wild birds away from poultry flocks and their food and water supply, limiting visitors, and monitoring bird health.Small flock owners are encouraged to confine their birds indoors, if possible, during wild bird migration.“AI is spreading in wild bird populations across the globe and presents a significant national concern as birds migrate to Canada,” the agency’s release said. “The CFIA continues to remind anyone with poultry or other susceptible birds to practice good biosecurity habits to protect them from infectious animal diseases.” Discover more on CKOM.com More On Air Now The Evan Bray Show - Encore Edition 12:00 AM - 3:00 AM Sports PA Carlton wins 5A high school football provincial championship 15h ago Carlton Crusaders earned a tough 35-34 win against Bishop James Mahoney Saints.

China reports first human case of H3N8 bird flu By Srishty Choudhury Apr 27, 2022 02:24 pm What's the story China has confirmed the first human infection with the H3N8 strain of avian flu in the Henan province. A four-year-old boy tested positive for the H3N8 strain after complaining of fever and other symptoms. However, the risk of widespread transmission among humans is low, said China's National Health Commission (NHC). None of the boy's close contacts were infected, it said. Context Why does this story matter? The H3N8 strain had earlier been detected elsewhere in the world in horses, dogs, birds, and seals, the NHC said. However, this is the first H3N8 human case that has been reported. Previous cases of avian flu or bird flu involving humans have largely involved the H5N1 and H7N9 strains, according to the US Centers for Disease Control. Statement Boy's family raised chickens at home The family of the boy raised chickens at home and lived in an area populated by wild ducks, the NHC said in a statement. The boy's case was a "one-off cross-species transmission and the risk of large-scale transmission is low," it said. The strain directly affected the boy, but it doesn't have the "ability to effectively infect humans," it added. Strains Other cases of bird flu in China In June 2021, China had reported the first human infection with the H10N3 strain of bird flu. The patient was a 41-year-old man from Zhenjiang city of the Jiangsu province. The infection was transmitted via poultry. In February 2021, the country had reported an H5N8 outbreak in Lianyungang, Jiangsu. In April 2021, the H5N6 strain was detected in wild birds in Shenyang, Liaoning. Information Stay away from sick, dead birds: NHC Even though the NHC said that after testing, the boy's human contacts didn't find any "abnormalities," it warned people to stay away from sick and dead birds. It also asked people to seek medical attention at the earliest in case of fever or respiratory issues. Avian flu What is avian influenza? Avian influenza primarily infects birds. It is often contracted by contact with sick birds and can also be passed from person to person. "Human infections of zoonotic, or animal-borne, influenzas are primarily acquired through direct contact with infected animals or contaminated environments, but do not result in the efficient transmission of these viruses between people," according to the World Health Organization. Symptoms Symptoms of avian influenza People with avian influenza A virus report mild to severe influenza-like illness symptoms, according to US Centers for Disease Control. Other symptoms include fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches, nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and vomiting. Shortness of breath, difficulty in breathing, pneumonia, acute respiratory distress, viral pneumonia, and respiratory failure may occur in severe cases. The neurological impact includes altered mental status and seizures. Do you know? India reported first H5N1 bird flu death in July 2021 In July 2021, India reported its first case of human death due to H5N1 avian influenza after an 11-year-old boy from Haryana died. The WHO said that the boy lived with a family member who owned a butchery.

This is the part of Phase II expansion of surveillance network.Though the COVID-19 new cases have gone down, city hospitals are witnessing rise in Influenza Like Illnesses (ILI), patients of Severe Acute Respiratory Illnesses (SARI). Faster diagnosis is the need of the hour to prevent these diseases or to cure the patients suffering from them. Considering this aspect, ICMR is conducting surveillance programmes. Under this programme, it has chosen AIIMS, Nagpur in Central India.As per the programme, AIIMS will get 25 throat swab samples every week from the Government hospitals including the dispensaries being run by Nagpur Municipal Corporation. These 25 samples will include 10 samples of the people from the community suffering from sore throat, fever, cough and 15 samples of the people admitted for SARI. RTPCR test will be conducted of every sample. If the tests come positive then the samples will be sent to National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune for genomic sequencing. If the patients are found positive for Influenza then the samples will be sent to SMC, Jaipur for further testing.This is a prestigious assignment for AIIMS, Nagpur which is the Institute of National Importance representing Central India. This project is allotted under Prevention and Control of Disease - ‘Development of Tools to prevent Outbreak of Epidemics’ to the 10 Viral Research Diagnostic Laboratory (VRDLs) for strengthening of ILI/SARI surveillance for human influenza viruses and SARS-CoV-2 through ICMR. The VRDL, AIIMS, Nagpur will be actively involved in training, supervision, mentoring, trouble shooting and quality control related to ILI/SARI surveillance. It may be recalled that VRDL, AIIMS, Nagpur has processed more than 4 lakh samples for COVID-19 and has been identified as Inter Lab Quality Control (ILQC) laboratory in Maharashtra apart from National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune and has mentored more than 300 microbiologists, pathologists and laboratory technicians for RT-PCR testing for COVID-19 from Maharashtra state India. This laboratory is designated as State Laboratory for Integrated Disease Surveillance Project (IDSP) for Nagpur, Gondia and adjoining districts.Director and CEO, AIIMS, Nagpur Maj.

The country has just faced its largest ever outbreak of bird flu, with more than 100 cases confirmed since late October. In Devon, there were cases of bird flu in Exeter as well as two locations in Tedburn St Mary and one in Newton St Cyres. Farmers have had to keep their chickens indoors and consequently label eggs as barn eggs rather than free-range eggs. Attractions such as Totnes Rare Breeds Farm have had to remove their birds from public display and lower admission fees as a result.

Paignton Zoo explained to DevonLive that zoos have a special permit to allow larger birds to remain out in the open as moving them indoors would compromise their welfare. The zoo's chickens and guinea fowl, however, are off show. Clare Rugg, head of conservation services at Wild Planet Trust which owns Paignton Zoo, said: “At Paignton Zoo we have 94 different species of birds and the welfare of our animals is always at the heart of our decision-making. To keep our birds safe from what has become an annual occurrence of avian influenza, we adhere to all of the guidance and regulations as set out by the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA). "These regulations have been created to reduce the spread of the infection from wild birds to poultry and other captive birds and an Avian Influenza Prevention Zone (AIPZ) has been established in Great Britain. To protect our indoor birds, we have footbaths located in entrances which are designed to disinfect the shoes of both staff and visitors and reduce the spread of the virus. In addition, all of our birds are monitored daily by our keepers and onsite vet team. “We have a number of species that can remain outdoors, including our flamingos, as zoos are permitted to have birds in outdoor settings as the alternative is putting them in housing which would compromise their welfare.” The AIPZ that Ms Rugg referred to is remaining in force across the UK, with only the housing measures component being lifted from Monday, May 2. This means all bird keepers must continue to take effective and precautionary biosecurity measures. Steve Nash, Wild Planet Trust’s head of campaigns and programmes, added that the annual occurrence of avian influenza has influenced how and where Paignton Zoo houses its birds. He said: “The decision to remove our Brookside walkthrough aviary near the zoo entrance was made in part due to concerns over avian influenza. The pathway through the aviary was one of the main visitor routes into and out of the zoo. Removing the birds allowed us to keep them safe elsewhere and at the same time, removed the need to restrict access to the area.” Read More Related Articles Wetherspoon eggs announcement amid UK bird flu outbreak Read More Related Articles National Trust and Paignton Zoo join forces to feed animals Story SavedYou can find this story in My Bookmarks.Or by navigating to the user icon in the top right.Follow DevonLiveFacebookTwitterCommentMore OnEasterExeterPaigntonPaignton Zoo What's OnallMost ReadMost RecentExmouthMagical festive lantern parade will light up Devon townOrganisers say it will be a 'joyful celebration of light'Gordon Ramsay says you've been serving Christmas dinner at the wrong timeGordon RamsayThe TV presenter and dad of six has a better way of making sure everyone enjoys the day, including the cookRenowned Devon farm shop unveils posh new additionExeterA stunning 'escape' has been createdUnique Christmas dinner on nostalgic Devon steam trainChristmasEarly booking is advisedExeter Christmas village to open with late shopping and more than 25 stallsChristmasThere will be mulled wine, freshly fired pizzas and outdoor street theatreExmouthMagical festive lantern parade will light up Devon townOrganisers say it will be a 'joyful celebration of light'Unique Christmas dinner on nostalgic Devon steam trainChristmasEarly booking is advisedGordon Ramsay says you've been serving Christmas dinner at the wrong timeGordon RamsayThe TV presenter and dad of six has a better way of making sure everyone enjoys the day, including the cookNutritionist's '5 a day' slow cooker mac and cheese recipe will be a hit with the familyFoodThis mac and cheese recipe is easy to make and sneaks in an extra five vegetables - making it the perfect dish to serve up to the family on a SundayNational Trust estates in Devon transformed into winter wonderlandsChristmasEven Santa will be paying a visit at some propertiesMost ReadMost RecentLocal NewsMan charged with murder after Shane Sweet stabbingHe will appear in court on MondayDevon funeral notices: Loving mum, 46, will be 'hard to forget'Funeral NoticesKerry Ann Thompson Hope leaves two childrenMissing 81-year-old from North Devon village found safe and wellPeopleBrenda was reported missing without a coat from LangtreeJennifer Saunders and Adrian Edmondson caught in Dartmoor planning rowJennifer SaundersOfficers argue there is 'insufficient justification for the works'Exeter's unsolved murder that shook the UKBBCThe police appeal is still live as the anniversary approachesMonty DonGardeners' World's Monty Don issues one warning about best plant to grow in NovemberMonty Don attempts to start his planting in the winter months, but often finds himself struggling due to wet weather - however, there's one bulb he says is perfect for November.Map shows worst areas of Devon for kids being overweight or obese NHSThe levels in some areas are alarmingExeter's unsolved murder that shook the UKBBCThe police appeal is still live as the anniversary approachesGary Caldwell slams 'joke' League One games during International breaksExeter City FC“It devalues the competition.
