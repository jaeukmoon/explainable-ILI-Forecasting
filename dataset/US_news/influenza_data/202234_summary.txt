Vaccine Recommendations: The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends routine annual influenza vaccination for all individuals aged 6 months and older without contraindications. The committee advises using a licensed and age-appropriate vaccine.

Available Vaccines: For the 2022-23 influenza season, all vaccines available in the United States are quadrivalent. They contain hemagglutinin derived from one influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, one influenza A(H3N2) virus, one influenza B/Victoria lineage virus, and one influenza B/Yamagata lineage virus. Inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV4s), recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV4), and live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV4) are expected to be available, while trivalent influenza vaccines are no longer available.

Timing of Vaccination: Influenza vaccines may be available as early as July or August, but vaccination should ideally be offered during September or October. Vaccination can continue throughout the season as long as influenza viruses are circulating and there is unexpired vaccine available. It is recommended to avoid vaccinating adults aged 65 years and older, and pregnant individuals in the first or second trimester in July and August, unless there are concerns about vaccine availability later in the season. Children aged 6 months through 8 years who require two doses should receive the first dose as soon as possible.

Updates: The report provides updates on the composition of the 2022-23 U.S. seasonal influenza vaccines and updates the description of available vaccines for the season. These updates are based on discussions held by ACIP during public meetings in October 2021, January 2022, February 2022, and June 2022.
