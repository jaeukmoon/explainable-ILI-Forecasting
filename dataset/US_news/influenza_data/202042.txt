According to the 2017–2019 Italian National Immunisation Plan, free immunisation is offered to the categories at increased risk of experience the complications of the infection (over 65 years old subjects, pregnant women and individuals with underlying conditions, including chronic heart diseases). Rising evidence suggests that influenza can trigger adverse cardiovascular events therefore the vaccination is recommended for secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases. Despite this, the influenza coverage rate in subjects with chronic heart disease is underestimated.MethodsThe study investigated the coverage rate in four consecutive influenza seasons (from 2011/2012 to 2014/2015) in subjects that benefit from exemption from paying healthcare costs for chronic heart disease living in Local Health Unit (LHU) of Ferrara (Italy), comparing the databases of exemptions and immunisations.ResultsThe levels of influenza vaccine uptake were unstable, reaching the 50.3% in 2011/2012 immunisation season and falling to 42.2% in the following year. Coverage rates increased with increasing age, without achieving the 75% target, neither in over 65 years old subjects. The logistic regression analysis showed that influenza coverage rates were statistically significant different (p < 0.0001, 0.003 only for category of disease in 2011/2012 immunisation season) according to age, district of residence, category of chronic heart disease and length of exemption, but not influenced by gender.ConclusionsThe recommendation of influenza immunisation was weakly followed in individuals with chronic heart diseases. A collaboration between cardiologists, GPs, scientific societies and patient associations could successfully support influenza vaccine uptake. Peer Review reports BackgroundInfluenza is a common, highly contagious respiratory illness caused by virus infecting all age groups. Every year about 5–15% of worldwide population experience seasonal influenza, with 3–5 million severe cases and more than 500,000 death [1]. Complications and consequent hospitalization are more common in the over 65 years old subjects and in those with chronic underlying conditions [2]. The most effective measure to prevent the infection is the annual vaccination [3]. The morbidity and mortality burden in subjects with underlying condition, including chronic heart disease is notable, especially in elderly. In Italy, it is accountable for approximately 8000 deaths and over 40,000 hospitalizations each year, mainly concentrated in the winter period [4]. Complications and deaths related to influenza are more frequent in patients with chronic diseases of the cardiovascular system than in patients with other chronic conditions. In addition to complications related to viral or bacterial pneumonia, the influenza infection can exacerbate pre-existing heart disease [5]. Comparing the number of deaths in the periods of circulation and absence of the virus, a mortality excess was observed: the surplus percentage of deaths varies from 18% in the States United in the period 1959–1999 to 66% in the Netherlands in the period 1979–1987 [6,7,8]. The influenza virus has a marked vascular tropism and a significant role in the atherosclerosis process was shown. The viral genome of influenza A virus was isolated in the wall of vessels with atherosclerotic lesions of patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting; moreover, a positive correlation between antibody titers against the influenza A virus and antibodies against oxidized LDL was found in the same patients [9]. In addition, the influenza virus plays a role on the inflammatory and hemocoagulative cascade, acting as a potential destabilizer of vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques and, consequently, as a promoter of coronary occlusion [10]. The temporal association between acute coronary syndromes and respiratory infections is sustained by peaks of winter incidence, with similar seasonal variability of both conditions [11]; moreover, about a third of acute coronary syndromes are preceded by respiratory symptoms [12]. A retrospective study also showed that early treatment of influenza in patients with cardiovascular disease is associated with a 60% reduction in the risk of recurrent cardiovascular events, including acute coronary syndromes, in the month following the diagnosis of infection [13]. The vaccination would have a non-specific protective effect eliminating an infection that could destabilize chronic inflammation of the vessel’s wall, while a specific effect would result from specific immunogenic properties of influenza viruses [14]. A decreasing number of cardiac events in vaccinated patients in the following summer was also observed, extending the protection to a period free from the virus circulation [15, 16]. According to the “antigen mimicry” theory, influenza viruses would express antigens similar to those expressed by atherosclerotic plaque [17]. A correlation was also found between the antibody titers of hemoagglutinin A of the influenza virus and oxidized LDL antibodies in patients with rapid progression of atherosclerosis [18].Since the 1960s, the US government recommended the annual vaccination of patients with cardiovascular disease, including individuals with coronary and other atherosclerotic vascular disease, as secondary prevention strategy [19] and this indication is still supported by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) [20]. A recent Cochrane meta-analysis [21] showed that influenza vaccine significantly reduced cardiovascular mortality (RR = 0.45; 95% confidence interval: 0.26–0.76; p value 0.003). American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology Guidelines [22] and European Society of Cardiology Guidelines [23] recommend influenza immunisation for patients with previous cardiovascular events. According to 2017–2019 Italian National Immunisation Plan [24], the influenza vaccine, administered by the General Practitioner or in Public Health clinic, is free offered to over 65 years old subjects and to patients suffering from chronic conditions, including heart diseases (namely diseases of the cardiovascular system, including acquired and congenital heart disease). The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a 75% coverage rate for at risk groups [25]. Despite national and international recommendations, coverage rates are unsatisfactory [26]. In Italy, the coverage rate in 18–64 years old subjects with at least one chronic disease in the 2017/2018 immunisation season was 23%, while considering only the individuals with chronic heart diseases the estimated coverage rate, according to the PASSI survey, was 23.3% in the period 2015–2018 [27].We studied the coverage rates for influenza vaccination in four consecutive immunisation seasons from 2011/2012 to 2014/2015 in subjects with chronic heart disease living in the area of the Local Health Unit of Ferrara (Italy) in order to evaluate the vaccine uptake, highlight possible conditions of lower immunisation and hypothesise strategies for improving influenza vaccination compliance.MethodsEthical aspectsThe research was approved by Ethics Committee of the Area Vasta Centro Emilia Romagna in June 2018 (Protocol Number EM244/2018/UniFe/160797_EM1).Study populationThe study was conducted on subjects with chronic heart diseases resident on the territory of the Local Health Unit (LHU) of Ferrara, that corresponds to the Province of Ferrara (353,481 inhabitants at the 2011 census survey), North-East of Italy, in the time span 2011–2015. Healthcare services are supplied by three hospitals and one University hospital, six “Case della salute” (specialistic health centre, including Public Health clinics) and about 250 General Practitioners (GPs). Subjects with chronic heart diseases were considered as all subjects with an effective exemption from co-payment of the healthcare costs for chronic diseases. As no specific registry was available, the electronic register of requests for exemption from co-payment of the healthcare costs for chronic diseases applied to the Primary Care Department of the Local Health Unit of Ferrara in the period from 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2014 was used. Subjects with exemption for acute conditions or presenting only a risk factor (for example hypertension without organ damage) were excluded. The selected codes for chronic heart disease are reported in Supplementary Material 1. The system adopted for the registration of exemption requests did not allow to establish if the exemption was effective in previous years. In addition, in 2011 the exemption renewal caused data overwriting, deleting information about exemption in preceding years. In the following years, any duplicates, due to multiple requests submitted by the same subject, were removed. The date of the first request was recorded as the release date.Immunisation coverage ratesData about influenza immunisation for five consecutive seasons (from 2011/2012 to 2014/2015) were obtained from the electronic Registry of Immunisation Service of Public Health Department of Local Health Unit of Ferrara. The database included for each administered vaccine dose personal data of the recipient, including date of birth, gender, municipality and district of residence, place where the vaccination was carried out (Public Health clinic, Community Pediatrics clinic, General Practitioner or Pediatrician’s clinic, Hospital clinic, other services). In the LHU of Ferrara immunisations of at risks children from zero to 14 years of age were administered in Community Pediatrics or Pediatrician’s clinic; from 15 years of age, the vaccination was administered by the General Practitioner or in Public Health clinic. The healthcare workers (HCW) could obtain the influenza immunisation also in the workplace (Hospital clinic, other services). Infants were considered vaccinated when received two doses after at least 4 weeks, for other children, as information about previous immunisations were not available, a single dose was considered. The link with exemptions database was conducted comparing main demographic data of each individual, including name, place and date of birth, residence and, where available, tax code.Statistical analysisFor all immunisation seasons, the Chi square test was applied to compare coverage rates for influenza immunization according to gender, age group, district of residence (Western District, Centre-North District, South-Eastern District), main category of disease (0A02 Diseases of the circulatory system–Heart diseases and diseases of pulmonary circulation, 0B02 Diseases of the circulatory system – Cerebrovascular Diseases, 0C02 Diseases of the circulatory system – Diseases of veins and lymphatics and other diseases of circulatory system, 0031 Arterial hypertension with organ damage, and undergone a procedure as heart valve replacement or transplant, cardiac device in situ and blood vessel replacement). Logistic regression analysis was applied to compare influenza coverage rate (dependent variable) while gender, age groups (0–14 years old, 15–64 years old, over 65 years old) district of residence, category of disease, length of exemption were independent variables. Statistical significance was set at 0.05. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS 19.0 and Stata 13.0.ResultsThe number of subjects with valid exemption from the co-payment of the healthcare costs for chronic heart diseases was variable over the years (Table 1), conditioned by validity’s duration and new requests received each year. The smallest number of exemptions was registered in 2011 (n = 12,231), while the maximum number was registered in 2012 (n = 15,363). On average, the number of effective exemptions by year was 13,475 (standard deviation = 1353.8). For each of the considered years, males were more numerous than females. Most of the females with exemptions belonged to the age group of 65 years or older. In males, however, the most numerous was the 15–64 years old age group, with the exception of 2014. A marginal percentage of exemptions was released to subjects in pediatric age group in both genders. The highest percentage of subjects with cardiovascular disease exemption were resident in the Centre-North District which is also the most populated: over 50% in 2013 and 2014; about 44% in 2011 and over 47% in 2012. The exemption from the co-payment of the healthcare costs was released according to different categories of chronic heart diseases as reported in Supplemental file 1. The disease most frequently associated with the exemption was arterial hypertension with organ damage which justified just under 60% of the released exemptions. About 30% of the exemptions were related to heart diseases and diseases of pulmonary circulation. The third most common cause for the exemption’s release was having undergone an operation (replacement and transplantation of heart valve, replacement of blood vessel, positioning of a cardiac device). The fourth most frequent reason for obtaining an exemption was a disease of the arteries, arterioles, capillaries, veins and lymphatic vessels in 2011–2012, and a cerebrovascular disease in 2013–2014. The duration of the exemption could range from up to 1 year to an unlimited length. The majority of the exemptions had a long duration (equal or longer than 5 years or permanent). The exemptions of unlimited duration were 44.1% in 2011, 30.5% in 2012 and then increased to 41.1 and 48.4% in 2013 and 2014 respectively. The goal for influenza immunisation coverage rate in people with chronic heart disease is 75%. In none of the considered vaccination seasons, coverage rates were close to the target value (Table 2). The trend of vaccination coverage was inconstant with the maximum value (50.3%) recorded in the 2011/2012 immunisation season. In the 2012/2013 vaccination season, the percentage of subjects with an exemption for chronic heart disease receiving the influenza vaccine dropped to 42.2%, and declined to 43.1% in the 2014/2013 vaccination season. In all the immunisation seasons, the coverage rate for influenza was higher in females than in the males, showing the same trend of variability described for the overall population. Influenza coverage rates according to age group are shown in Fig. 1. The influenza vaccine uptake in subjects with exemption from co-payment of healthcare costs for chronic heart disease increased with increasing age, showing a “U” trend with values ​​higher than 20% starting from the pediatric age, progressively decreasing in the following age groups and reaching the highest levels only in over 65 years old individuals. The 75% target coverage rate was achieved in the 2011/2012 and in the 2013/2014 immunisation seasons in the 65–74 years old age group and in over 85 years old subjects. Coverage rates for influenza in people beneficiary of the exemption from co-payment of healthcare costs for chronic heart disease by gender and age groups (pediatric, adult, elderly) are reported in Fig. 2. Coverage levels were similar in males and females, both in adults and in the elderly. Higher values were observed in females than in males, in children in the 2013/2014 and 2014/2015 immunisation seasons; in adulthood in the 2011/2012 and 2012/2013 immunisation seasons, in the 2012/2013 and 2013/2014 immunisation seasons in the elderly. No statistically significant difference between genders was shown. In pediatric age (Fig. 3a), the greater compliance to influenza immunisation was recorded in subjects residing in the South-Eastern District with the highest value (36%) in the 2011/2012 immunisation season, while the lowest level was found in the 2014/2015 immunisation season in children living in the Western District. In all immunisation seasons no statistically significant differences between districts was shown. Similar coverage rates were registered in adult population without distinction between the three districts in all the immunisation seasons (Fig. 3b). Also in the 15–64 years old age group the highest influenza coverage rates were observed in residents of the South-Eastern District, while lower coverage rates were found in individuals residing in the Western District, with significantly lower values ​​than in the other two districts in the immunisation seasons 2011/2012, 2012/2013 and 2013/2014 (Table 3). In over 65-year-olds, the greater compliance to influenza vaccination in all districts was recorded in the 2011/2012 immunisation season (Fig. 3c). Even in this age group, the lowest levels of coverage rates were found in residents of the Western District and the highest in residents in the South-Eastern District. In all vaccination seasons, the coverage rates of elderly residing in the South-Eastern and Centre-North District were significantly higher than those of residents of the Western District, as shown in Table 3. Influenza coverage rates by category of heart disease are presented in Fig. 4. In pediatric age group (Fig. 4a), only exemptions for chronic diseases belonging to the category 0A02 - Diseases of the circulatory system–Heart diseases and diseases of pulmonary circulation were released. The coverage rates were about 20% in all immunisation seasons, excluding the 2011/2012 season that exceeded the 25%. The higher levels of influenza immunisation in adults were observed in subjects with exemption for the category 0A02 Heart diseases and diseases of pulmonary circulation in association with the category 0C02 - Diseases of the arteries, arterioles, capillaries, veins and lymphatic vessels (Fig. 4b), with values between 24.2% (2013/2014 immunisation season) and 37.5% (2011/2012 immunisation season); having undergone an operation (heart valve replacementransplant, replacement of a blood vessel, cardiac device in situ) with values ranging between 31.7% (2011/2012 immunisation season) and 27.6% (2012/2013 and 2013/2014 immunisation seasons); hypertension with organ damage with a maximum value of 30% in the 2011/2012 immunisation season and a minimum of 23.1% in the 2014/2015 immunisation season. In elderly (Fig. 4c), the influenza coverage rates were higher than in adults in all category of chronic heart diseases. Subjects with exemption due to the association of diseases belonging to the categories 0A02 and 0C02 showed greater compliance to influenza vaccination. The comparison between coverage rates according to the category of chronic heart disease always showed a statistically significant difference (p < 0.002 in the 2011/2012 immunisation season and p < 0.0001 in the other immunisation seasons), both in the 15–64 years old age group and in the over 65 years old group. Considering coverage rates according to the length of exemption (Fig. 5), higher levels of vaccination compliance were obtained in children with an exemption lasting from 1 to 4 years (50.7% in the 2011/2012 immunisation season). In the 15–64 years old age group (Fig. 5b), higher levels of influenza vaccine uptake in subjects with duration of the exemption ranging from one to 4 years were observed, with values ​​varying from 41.3% in the 2011/2012 immunisation season to 29% in the 2014/2015 immunisation season. In elderly (Fig. 5c), 73.9% of subjects with unlimited exemption, 64.8% of individuals with exemption’s length equal or greater of 5 years, 63.8% of over 65 years old with exemption up to 1 year and 53.6% of people with exemption with a duration of one to 4 years were vaccinated against influenza in 2011/2012 season. The comparison between influenza coverage rates according to the duration of the exemption showed a statistically significant difference (p < 0.0001) in all the immunisation seasons, both in the 15–64 years old age group than in the over 65 years old. The logistic regression analysis (Table 4) showed that influenza coverage rates were statistically significant different (p < 0.0001, 0.003 only for category of disease in 2011/2012 immunisation season) according to age, district of residence, category of chronic heart disease and length of exemption, but not influenced by gender. Influenza vaccine uptake was statistically significant higher (p < 0.0001) in elderly, in subjects living in the South-Eastern District, in individuals with an exemption’s length equal or greater of 5 years. Statistically significant higher cover rates were observed in subjects with exemption for chronic heart diseases (code 0A02) associated to chronic diseases of veins and lymphatics (code 0C02) in 2011/2012 and 2012/2013 immunisation seasons (p = 0.034 and p = 0.014 respectively), in individuals that underwent an intervention in 2012/2013, 2013/2014 and 2014/2015 immunisation seasons (p < 0.0001, p = 0.008 and p = 0.001 respectively). Subjects with exemption for chronic diseases of veins and lymphatics (code 0C02) alone had statistically significant lower influenza coverage in all immunisation seasons.

Despite this, the poor available data about the coverage rates in patients with chronic heart disease revealed unsatisfactory levels of compliance. In patients with exemption from the co-payment of healthcare costs for chronic heart disease in LHU of Ferrara, the higher influenza coverage rate (50.3%) was obtained in the 2011/2012 immunisation season, and progressively decreased to 43.1% in the 2014/2015 immunisation season. The optimal target of 75% of vaccinated chronic patients was never reached. In Europe, influenza vaccination of subjects with chronic heart diseases depicted different levels, but still far from desirable rate: below 20% in France [33], 26% in Portugal [34], 32% in Poland [35], 52% in Spain [36]. The highest coverage rate in patients with chronic heart disease was over than 66% in Korea [37]. Canada and the United States achieved vaccination coverage of 43 and 50.5%, respectively [5, 38]. However, the comparison should take in account the different method used (mainly surveys based on interviews or questionnaires administered directly or by telephone with possible recall bias) and the difference in vaccine offer and recommendation in people with chronic conditions depending on healthcare system.The overall coverage rates in subjects with exemption from the co-payment of healthcare costs for chronic heart disease in LHU of Ferrara were higher than 40% and up to 50% in the 2011/2012 immunisation season, still far away from the ideal target. The influenza vaccination compliance could be partially explained by individuals aged sixty-five or older, who have aged-based recommendation for immunisation. Actually, coverage rates in over 65 years old age group were higher and a statistically significant difference according to age was found.When considering only the 15–64 years old age group, the coverage levels (minimum value 22.3% in the 2012/2013 immunisation season and maximum value 28.3% in the 2011/2012 immunisation season) are similar to the 23.3% detected in adults aged 18–64 years with cerebrovascular diseases by the Passi Surveillance System [27]. Having an unlimited exemption and benefit from an exemption for the association of category 0A02 heart diseases and diseases of pulmonary circulation and category 0C02 Diseases of the arteries, arterioles, capillaries, veins and lymphatic vessels determined higher compliance to influenza vaccination both in the over 65 years old subjects and in the 15–64 years old age group. In adults also undergoing an intervention, as heart valve transplanteplacement or a cardiac device in situ, increased the immunisation recourse. The increased influenza vaccine uptake in these categories of individuals could be related to the higher severity of chronic heart disease, as suggested by the association of more chronic conditions or by the need for a surgical treatment, and also by the unlimited exemption.The severity of the disease could lead these individuals to more frequent contacts with healthcare workers (General Practitioner, specialists in cardiology) and therefore to receive multiple opportunities for information and offer of the influenza vaccination. According to Lu et al. [5], the probability of receiving the influenza vaccination increased in adults with chronic conditions who in the last year had ten or more contacts with healthcare personnel compared to those who had no contact. The growing number of accesses to healthcare facilities could be determined by multiple pathologies. Due to the progressive aging of the population, comorbidity is growing in industrialized countries [39]. Suffering from two or more chronic diseases was shown to increase the influenza coverage rate by ten percentage points compared to individuals with a single chronic disease [5]. A dose-response association between influenza vaccine uptake and increasing number of chronic diseases was also observed [40]. Higher rates of immunisation in subjects with more serious conditions can be confirmed by higher levels of vaccination in the elderly, who most likely suffer from more relevant pathological conditions, but oppose with the theory of the so-called “healthy user effect”. Several studies [14, 41] indicated that individuals who choose to adopt preventive measures, vaccination included, are more prone to a healthier lifestyle (physical activity, healthy nutrition, avoid smoking, increased attention to their own well-being, more frequent contacts with the doctor) unconsciously acquiring positive attitudes for health.In general, the percentage of vaccinated elderly did not reach the minimum desirable threshold of 75%, although the coverage rate in over 65 was higher than in younger at-risk subjects. A great concern in immunisation strategies design is the low compliance in individuals with risk condition, regardless of age. An ongoing lowering of the threshold age for recommending influenza vaccination, starting from 60 years old, could benefit the increasing coverage rate in chronic patients. A study conducted in Spain [42] showed that lowering at 60 years old the age of recommendation increased the vaccination coverage in the target population in all age groups. A pharmacoeconomical analysis applied to the Italian scenario [43] documented that extending the recommendation to 60–64-year olds would also allow to achieve the protection of many subjects with chronic diseases of this age group at no cost. The increased costs for the purchase and administration of the vaccine would be completely balanced by the reduction of the infection and duration of the epidemic, simultaneously decreasing the cost for visits, hospitalizations and antibiotic drugs. The overall savings for the National Health Service would be associated also to a decrease of working days lost and associated costs.The annual immunization is usually delivered in primary care setting and only occasionally patients are recruited in hospital after an acute event, adversely affecting the compliance. The IAMI study (Influenza vaccination After Myocardial Infarction), a large randomized multicentre prospective placebo-controlled trial enrolling patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) or non-STEMI (NSTEMI) undergoing coronary angiography that received influenza vaccine in hospital in order to evaluate death and cardiovascular outcomes at 1 year, is currently ongoing [44]. First results are expected in late 2020 and will add high-quality evidence to guidelines recommending influenza vaccination for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. A relationship between the risk of acute cardiovascular events following an acute infection, including pneumonia, acute bronchitis, urinary tract infection and bacteriemia has been widely described [45,46,47,48,49]. The association has been shown with a variety of pathogens (viral and bacterial) and sites of infection, stronger and longer when the infection is more severe [50]. The recently and sudden spread of a novel Coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2) causing pneumonia from Wuhan (Hubei province, China) and the WHO pandemic declaration urges attention to the management of subjects with chronic heart disease [51]. The patients with chronic heart diseases are more likely to develop severe symptoms, if infected with SARS-CoV-2, and more susceptible to poor prognosis [52, 53]. These finding, even limited, reinforce the link between acute infection and worsening of chronic heart diseases, strengthening the importance of (if available, as influenza) immunisation compliance in subjects at-risk.The possible bias of our study was mainly related to the database used for the classification of subjects with chronic heart diseases that was arranged from the registry of exemption. A comprehensive specific database of individuals with chronic cardiovascular conditions was not available and the used registry represented, to our knowledge, the best approach to identify the study population. As only subjects that obtained an active exemption were considered, we could not completely rule out the possibility that other individuals with chronic condition but without exemption were excluded. In consideration of these issues, the data represented the description of results obtained in several consecutive immunisation seasons in the Local Health Unit of Ferrara and could not be generalised. The leading strength of our study consisted in the high quality of data about influenza vaccinations, as the database included all delivered immunisations, regardless the place of administration.ConclusionsLow coverage rates, similar to the values ​​estimated by the Passi Surveillance System, were found in patients with exemption from co-payment of healthcare costs for chronic heart diseases in the 15–64 years old age group. The compliance to influenza vaccination in subjects with chronic heart diseases showed an increase only in over 65 years old. Vaccination policies based exclusively on the risk condition seem not completely effective in ensuring adequate coverage in people with chronic cardiovascular disease. The promotion of influenza immunisation in the population with chronic diseases could benefit from the synergy between cardiologists, general practitioners, scientific societies and patient associations to implement an awareness campaign on the advantage of vaccination. An ongoing extension of the recommendation of influenza vaccination, regardless of the presence of chronic diseases, to subjects younger than 65 years old could also be valuable, in consideration of the high prevalence of risk conditions starting from the age of fifty. This offer would increase the size of the target population of vaccination with minimal added costs compared to the prospective health gain of effectively reaching a large portion of vulnerable population, through a single recommendation that takes account of age only.

In September 1918 during the influenza pandemic, these men gargled salt water after a day working at Camp Dix in New Jersey. This was a preventative measure against the 1918 flu, which had spread to army camps. US Army/RBM Vintage Images/Alamy CNN — If the idea of drinking hand sanitizer, absorbing ultraviolet light and gargling salt water to prevent or treat Covid-19 sounds bizarre to you, know that this isn’t the first time humans have put themselves in dangerous situations to quell their fears. In the face of threat by a new infectious disease, people become desperate, said Dr. Jeremy Brown, an emergency care physician and author of “Influenza: The Hundred-Year Hunt to Cure the Deadliest Disease in History.” That desperation and a similar threat were what made people living during the 1918 flu pandemic — which killed 50 million to 100 million people worldwide — flock to dangerous quack treatments like moths to flames. That included doctors. Although conventional doctors had just recently gained more respect than alternative practitioners by the early 20th century, mainstream doctors still “had almost nothing to offer” for the flu said Laura Spinney, a science journalist and author of “Pale Rider: The Spanish Flu of 1918 and How It Changed the World.” Photo-Illustration: Getty Images/CNN Related article What the 1918 flu pandemic can teach us about coronavirus Since they thought the 1918 flu was a bacterial disease instead of a virus, their knowledge and treatment efforts fell short, she said. “Through the course of the pandemic, you see people gradually turning away from conventional medicine as they realize it can’t help and turning to the alternatives, folk medicines, quack cures and so on,” Spinney said. “Which, of course, until very recently (in the early 20th century), had been equally respectable and equally accessible.” Doctors also “really had no concept of when a medicine becomes a poison — how medicines interact with human tissues and what the right dosing is,” Spinney added. Those questions are what “we ask in our clinical trials these days that cost so much, take so long and try to measure safety and efficacy.” Additionally, during the Covid-19 pandemic, “we’ve talked a lot … about the importance of trust between people and doctors and public health experts,” Spinney said. “But trust also mediates the kind of intimate relationship between a patient and their physician. And it shapes, in a strong way, that placebo effect and hence the effectiveness of any treatment. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images) Spencer Platt/Getty Images Related article 5 common coronavirus misconceptions and the science you need to know “One of the interesting things you see in 1918 is that trust broken down because people saw that their doctors were hopeless. And so they, seeking to control the symptoms, turned to alternative systems which they felt could offer more hope, more effective treatments at that point,” she added. “In different ways, both these pandemics have illustrated to us how absolutely critical to so many aspects of health care— not least, whether people participate in vaccination campaigns — comes down in the end to trust and trust the general public has in their medics and in their governments.” Devastation, desperation and an inexperienced, unregulated medical field constituted a petri dish for numerous unproven — and sometimes barbaric — treatments. Aspirin out of control Aspirin, made from the bark of willow trees, had been used to treat pain for millennia. Since aspirin was known for reducing fevers, too, the drug became the international first-line treatment for flu — sometimes administered in doses six times higher than what is now known to be safe, Brown said. The problem was misunderstanding that aspirin has a “narrow therapeutic window, meaning if you give too little it doesn’t work (but if) you give too much, it can cause some very, very dangerous conditions.” They include “sweating, ringing in the ears, rapid breathing and then brain swelling and coma, convulsions and death,” Brown said. Claudette Barius/Warner Bros./Everett Collection Related article 'Contagion' vs. coronavirus: The film's connections to a real life pandemic Given the exorbitant doses and fatal side effects, many flu deaths may have been from aspirin overdoses rather than just the virus itself, some studies have suggested. However, some countries with death tolls in the millions — such as India — didn’t have easy access to aspirin — so it probably didn’t have a major impact on the global death toll, according to one study, Spinney said. Antimalarial drugs: Quinine vs. hydroxychloroquine Quinine, another centuries-old drug from cinchona bark, has been used mainly for treating malaria, caused by infection with the parasite Plasmodium. Like the flu, a symptom of malaria is fever. Woodrow Wilson the 28th President of the United States of America in 1916. Topical Press Agency/Hulton Archive/Getty Images Related article Before Trump, another US president downplayed a pandemic and was infected “If you have malaria, you give somebody quinine, you attack the parasite,” Brown said. “If you don’t understand that the fever goes away because the parasite is killed by the quinine, you miss out that little step and say the fever went away because the quinine, so quinine must be good for all fevers.” Quinine wasn’t toxic to the flu virus since the infective agent that caused flu — a virus — differed from the infective agent that induces malaria — a parasite. That modern medicine will test therapies for similar symptoms is reasonable and common, Brown said. “The problem is if you just take a drug used for one condition and you’re not testing it to see if it improves a second condition, but you’re just simply giving it on the belief that it must, should or will,” he added. Gerard Julien/AFP/Getty Images Related article Fearing coronavirus, Arizona man dies after taking a form of chloroquine used to treat aquariums That’s the story of the suggestion that hydroxychloroquine can treat Covid-19 symptoms, Brown added — another antimalarial drug that was once touted by US President Donald Trump and temporarily issued an emergency use authorization by the US Food and Drug Administration. “At the beginning, the question was perfectly reasonable: Does this drug help in this condition?” Brown said. “You don’t start with the statement ‘it will help’ without undergoing … all the slow and methodical ways in which we test drugs. There are a lot of drugs that we thought would help and had horrible side effects or unknown effects that we haven’t bothered to test them.” Drain their blood, rid their disease For more than 2,500 years, medical practitioners had surgically removed blood from patients to blindly treat disease. Partly based on the Greek philosophy of four humors — black bile, phlegm, yellow bile and blood — as the basis of emotions, temperament and health, bloodletting was believed to remedy disease caused by imbalanced humors. “Some people were hooked on to the belief that even if you were well, having some blood removed was sort of a good preventative measure, like, perhaps today, we might take some vitamins or go on a jog,” Brown said. Researchers analyzed the genomes of virus fragments found on smallpox vaccination kits used during the Civil War. The kits are housed at the Mütter Museum of the College of Physicians of Philadelphia. From JD Howell/McMaster University Related article Civil War-era smallpox vaccination kits offer new insights on how the virus was eradicated In the 19th century, doctors used bloodletting to treat fevers, headaches and difficulty breathing. In 1918, “having observed that some patients seemed to take a turn for the better following a gushing nosebleed, menstruation, even — traumatically — miscarriage,” Spinney wrote in her book, “some revived the ancient practice of bloodletting.” The trust in and respect for this historical method meant that many practitioners, including top-tier military doctors, swore by bloodletting after others considered it useless. Gas fumes for symptoms Some British parents took their sick children to the local gasworks to sit and inhale fumes to reduce their flu symptoms. A sanitary worker who went to investigate this claim “saw that there was indeed a relationship that while a lot of people were dying of influenza in the local area, at these gasworks where people were working, their influenza rate was much, much lower than the general population,” Brown said. “This led people to this observation that inhaling the chlorine gas would be good for you.” View of a policeman wearing a flu mask talking to a couple. The man is wearing a mask but woman is not, prompting a warning from the policeman. Others wearing masks can be seen in the background. Text written under photo: "Get one like this Right Away." California State Library Related article Face masks: in 2020, 'mask slacking' is more partisan than in 1918, historians say Though chlorine is an effective disinfectant that, in high doses, can kill bacteria and viruses, it is also poisonous. Why parents started taking their kids to gasworks before their ideas were substantiated might have started with growing rumors, Brown said. Laxatives, enemas and castor oil “Evacuating the bad stuff out of the patient” was the mindset of doctors who treated their patients’ fevers with castor oil, enemas and laxatives made from magnesia or mercury chloride, Brown said. “There was this belief that an enema would be good for you regardless, really, of what your specific disease was,” he added. “We have medical textbooks that were published as late as 1913 (or) 1914, in which laxatives were recommended as a treatment for the fevers that accompanied influenza.” Expelling evil spirits and elements Since Western medicine hadn’t yet fully spread through Eastern countries such as China and India, some relied on their ancient, traditional forms of healing.

It could happen again “Witch doctors in the hills of India moulded human figures out of flour and water and waved them over the sick to lure out the evil spirits,” Spinney wrote in her book. “In China, besides parading the figures of dragon kings through their towns, people went to public baths to sweat out the evil winds, smoked opium and took yin qiao san — a powdered mix of honeysuckle and forsythia that had been developed under the Qing (dynasty) for ‘winter sickness.’” Generations of local cultures and traditions shaped the remedies people sought to alleviate their symptoms. “Human beings, in general, need to feel a sense of control over whatever is afflicting them. That’s just a perennial truth,” Spinney said. Lessons from 1918 Back in 1918, there was no widely available flu vaccine (1940s), no US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (1946), no World Health Organization (1948) and no polio vaccine (1954). Doctors and the general public know a lot more than they did in 1918 — so while doctors in 1918 didn’t know any better, “we can’t claim ignorance” about this pandemic, Brown said.

Student flu vaccine clinics are available until Nov. 10. Schedule through myUHS. Credit: Penn State. Creative CommonsExpandOctober 15, 2020UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. — Flu season is quickly approaching, and with influenza viruses and the virus that causes COVID-19 expected to be circulating at the same time, it is especially important to get a flu vaccine this year. The initiative #FightFluPSU by Penn State University Health Services (UHS) brings awareness and educates students on the flu as well as promotes the UHS student flu vaccine clinics. The clinics are by appointment only and run through Nov. 10 in Alumni Hall in the HUB-Robeson Center at University Park. “The symptoms of influenza viruses have a resemblance to symptoms of COVID-19, so the flu vaccine will be more important than ever this year,” said Valerie Fulton, infectious disease manager at UHS. “Influenza symptoms can keep you bedridden for a week or more. An annual flu vaccine is the best way to help protect you against getting an influenza infection.” The cost of this year’s vaccine is $25, billable to insurance or the student’s Bursar account. Although most insurances cover the cost, to make sure students have access to the vaccine, the Student Fee Board has allocated funds to cover the cost of the flu vaccine for more than 4,500 students, and approximately 2,500 free flu shots remain available. The remaining UHS flu vaccine clinics will be held on the following dates from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. in Alumni Hall in the HUB: Thursday, Oct. 15 Wednesday, Oct. 21 Thursday, Oct. 22 Monday, Oct. 26 Thursday, Oct. 29 Tuesday, Nov. 10 Students must schedule an appointment via myUHS in advance to receive a flu vaccine during any of the clinics; students at Commonwealth Campus locations are encouraged to contact their on-campus health service, if applicable, or a local provider to inquire about clinics in their area. Getting vaccinated during the pandemic is crucial to conserving scarce health care resources, managing the cases on campus, and keeping the community healthy. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has emphasized the importance of getting the flu shot in order to protect yourself and those in your community. Students attending the flu vaccine clinic are asked to complete a short series of pre-visit requirements. Students must complete: The Consent to Treat Notice of Privacy Practices Student Account Billing Financial Aid Statement in myUHS Additionally, students are expected to upload their health insurance information. UHS will bill in-network health insurance providers for the cost of the vaccine; students who are uninsured, have out-of-network coverage, and/or do not supply insurance information will be billed to their Bursar account if the Student Fee Board allocation does not cover their vaccine. Students with insurance needs or questions should visit https://studentaffairs.psu.edu/insurance-advocate. Payment and insurance information will not be collected at the clinics. On the day of the appointment, students must bring their Penn State ID. For more information on the flu clinics and the #FightFluPSU campaign, visit the UHS flu clinic webpage.

The Maryland city’s health commissioner had placed a ban on public Halloween events, instructing the police chief to prevent people from holding “carnivals and other forms of public celebrations.” The United States was in the midst of the second, and most deadly, wave of the 1918 influenza pandemic. And that meant Americans had to curtail their usual Halloween revelry.In the early 20th century, revelers did not knock on doors to trick-or-treat and Halloween was in general less of a child-centered holiday than it is today. Adults dressed up and held private parties or joined celebrations in the street. Meanwhile, young people—especially boys and young men—spent the night pulling pranks and vandalizing their neighbors’ property. This might mean stealing neighbors’ gates and building a bonfire with them, or stopping a train by laying a fake stuffed “body” on the tracks.Bans Established Due to Fear of Virus Spread, And Respect for Flu Victims The Spanish Flu Was Deadlier Than WWIDuring the pandemic, cities banned or discouraged these traditions to reduce transmission of the virus, and also to be “respectful of those who might be sick or have lost loved ones,” says Katie Foss, a professor of media studies at Middle Tennessee State University and author of Constructing the Outbreak: Epidemics in Media and Collective Memory. Cities that had already placed bans on large gatherings might issue separate statements reminding people not to break them on Halloween, says J. Alex Navarro, assistant director of the Center for the History of Medicine at the University of Michigan and one of the editors-in-chief of The American Influenza Epidemic of 1918-1919: A Digital Encyclopedia. Even if cities didn’t ban Halloween events outright, they might encourage people to tone it down.Officials “admonished parents to tell their kids: We know you’re going to go out and do these pranks and these tricks and be loud and rowdy,” he says; “but keep in mind there are lots of people who are convalescing at home and trying to get their rest, and who aren’t going to be able to go out the next day and fix all the damage that these rowdy kids have caused.”In Spokane, Washington, Navarro says police were supposed to take away Halloween masks if they saw people out wearing them. While wearing cloth flu-prevention masks was encouraged or mandated in some western U.S. cities, Navarro says officials probably saw Halloween masks as dangerous because revelers commonly passed these homemade masks around, taking turns wearing them.When Mask‑Wearing Rules in the 1918 Pandemic Faced ResistanceMost people complied, but some resisted (or poked holes in their masks to smoke).Read moreWoodrow Wilson Got the Flu in a Pandemic During the World War I Peace TalksLingering effects of the 'Spanish flu' may have hindered Wilson's ability to effectively advocate for his '14 Points' at the Paris Peace Conference.Read moreHow Trick‑or‑Treating Became a Halloween TraditionWhy do children dress in costume and knock on strangers' doors to ask for treats on Halloween? The practice can be traced to the ancient Celts, early Roman Catholics and 17th‑century British politics.Read moreSporadic Halloween Revelry and Mischief ReportedIn many cities, it appears most people heeded officials’ bans or warnings regarding Halloween. “Hallowe’en revels lack the spirit of previous affairs: Urchins make dismal effort to revive classic forays on ash cans and fences,” reported the Buffalo Express in a headline the day after Halloween in 1918.Still, reports of revelry differed between and even within cities. On November 3, the St. Louis Globe Democrat reported that Halloween “passed by this year without the usual gay parties and merrymaking among the youngsters, by the edict of the health commissioner.” Yet a couple of days before, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch had described a completely different Halloween night in the Missouri city.“Influenza bans seemingly did not blight Young America’s observance of Halloween in St. Louis,” the Post-Dispatch reported. “The police report the usual number of street lights extinguished and the usual number of bread boxes overturned.” More dangerously, someone had shot a woman in a car and sent another bullet through a woman’s bedroom window.Confined Residents Were Itching to Get OutPhotoQuest/Getty ImagesA New York city street sweeper wears a mask during the influenza epidemic, October 1918.The day after Halloween, The Birmingham News ran a headline claiming “Halloween Ghosts Are Noisiest That Ever Pestered Birmingham.” The Alabama paper speculated residents had been itching to get out after “almost a month of confinement” due to the pandemic, and may have been motivated by the news that World War I was drawing to a close.“This night was more gloriously observed and property was more thoroughly devastated than at any time since the Magic City has sported a charter,” the article reported.That same day in Texas, the Dallas Evening Journal ran a headline claiming “Halloween Celebration In Dallas Unusually Rough and Boisterous.” That night, a two-year-old suffered burn injuries, an eight-year-old sprained his ankle, someone struck a 14-year-old in the head with a bottle, and there were multiple injuries from drivers hitting people with their cars. There was also theft: young people stole a horse, a car, a piano and multiple tires off people’s cars.The flu pandemic continued after Halloween, stretching past Armistice Day on November 11 and into 1919. It remains the deadliest flu pandemic ever recorded, killing roughly 675,000 people in the United States and up to 50 million people worldwide. Some experts estimate that it infected a third of the world’s population, or about 500 million people.By: Becky LittleBecky Little is a journalist based in Washington, D.C.

Although cases of flu decreased last year with the introduction of COVID-19 mask wearing, social distancing and handwashing, an estimated 700 people still died of the disease., and many more suffered symptoms. Here, pediatric epidemiologist and infectious disease specialist Dr. Emily Godbout of Children’s Hospital of Richmond at VCU offers five crucial reasons why everyone should get a flu shot this year. 1. Flu shots help reduce serious respiratory illness. While some people who get vaccinated may still get the flu, the flu shot typically prevents about 7 in 10 people who receive it from developing moderate to severe symptoms. So even though the vaccine might not completely prevent the flu, it can help keep you out of the hospital. “Reducing the overall burden of respiratory illnesses is really important to help protect vulnerable populations at risk for severe disease,” Godbout says. “It also helps lessen the resulting burden on our health care system, which is crucial throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.” Godbout adds that while practices you follow to help guard against COVID-19, such as handwashing, social distancing and wearing masks, will probably help decrease the spread of influenza, the flu shot is still the single most effective way to reduce the spread of the flu. 2. Flu shots are safe. “The flu shot is very safe and effective at helping prevent severe disease and hospitalization,” Godbout confirms. The doctor also reassures patients that they will not get the flu from the vaccine. “The virus is inactivated,” she explains, “so it can’t actually cause the flu after you get the shot.” Flu shots are recommended for anyone six months old and older, with rare exceptions. 3. Flu shots are updated every year. “The U.S. flu vaccine is reviewed every single year and updated to match circulating flu viruses,” Godbout explains. “The flu vaccine can typically protect against three or four different viruses. Since the virus changes from year to year, immunization from the previous year is not protective." She also stresses that our antibody response — what helps us fight the virus — can decrease over time, so a yearly dose helps boost the antibody response before the start of the flu season. 4. Flu and COVID-19 share similar symptoms. It’s important to know that some symptoms of the flu and COVID-19 are similar. If you have symptoms you’re concerned about, call your health care provider right away. You may need to be tested for both the flu and COVID-19 to know what you have and how best to treat it. While receiving the flu shot doesn't mean you can't get the flu, vaccination will at least lessen the severity of your symptoms. Reducing the spread of flu cases overall, by getting vaccinated, will help cut down on the number of seriously ill patients that clinics and hospitals will see, which will help everyone get through flu season more easily. 5. A flu shot protects you through the season. Now is the best time to get vaccinated, as it takes a couple of weeks for antibodies to develop in your body. The vaccine will continue to protect you through the worst months of the flu season. “It’s a great idea to get the flu shot right before flu season, so September and October are really good times to get vaccinated,” Godbout recommends. "We will continue to offer the flu shot throughout the fall and winter, but ideally we want to see people get it by the end of October.” To get your flu shot Make an appointment at your doctor’s office to get your flu shot or visit one of your local pharmacies or grocery stories. Many offer flu shots without an appointment.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there are many positive indicators for getting your flu vaccine, and during 2020-21 to protect yourself and the people around you from influenza, and to help reduce the strain on healthcare systems responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. The flu vaccine prevents millions of illnesses and flu-related hospitalizations each year. During 2018-2019, 49 percent of the U.S. population chose to get a flu vaccine, and the CDC estimates they prevented a projected 4.4 million influenza illnesses, 58,000 influenza-associated hospitalizations, and 3,500 flu deaths. The flu vaccine has been shown to reduce the risk of having to go to the doctor with flu by 40 to 60 percent and flu shots protect you, your family, your co-workers, and your community.

(L.B. Foote Collection/Archives of Manitoba)Social SharingCBC's Muddied Water: 1919 podcast explored a city divided by the conditions that led to the Winnipeg General Strike. In this bonus episode, we explore the flu pandemic that hit the city one year and similarities now 100 years later to the COVID-19 pandemic. Listen to all episodes at cbc.ca/muddiedwater or on Apple or Google. A few months ago, the only curves most people cared about involved their own waistlines. COVID-19 gave new meaning to the term.Since the coronavirus pandemic was declared in March, public health officials have urged citizens to "flatten the curve" — the figure in question being the bell-shaped curve of the now-familiar line chart that illustrates the daily number of people with active cases of the virus known as SARS-CoV-2.The COVID-19 curve in Winnipeg rose slightly in late March and early April, flattened out almost entirely during the spring and summer and then jumped dramatically in September, when the number of cases spiked in Manitoba's capital.As much as Winnipeggers may not want to hear this, we can still only see the beginning of the COVID-19 curve. This pandemic will play out for many more months, if not several years.But we can already see how the initial ascent of the COVID-19 curve compares with the last pandemic curve in Winnipeg.Insurmountable chaos: How 2 soldiers stopping in Winnipeg helped lead to 1,200 deaths from Spanish FluMore than a century ago, what's known as the Spanish influenza largely skipped Manitoba during its initial worldwide wave late in the winter of 1918.The second wave of the pandemic, in the fall of 1918, hit Winnipeg hard, with a spike that quickly escalated out of control. There were several thousand infections in a matter of weeks.The influenza curve did not flatten out in Winnipeg until thousands of residents contracted the disease. (Jacques Marcoux/CBC)The two curves bear little resemblance, partly because of the viruses themselves — but mostly because of the immense changes to modern medicine, public health, personal hygiene and the way people live.Some of those changes were necessitated by the severity of the 1918-20 influenza pandemic. Entirely different pandemic curvesUsing newspaper and medical archives, it's possible to piece together several months worth of daily case counts for the 1918-20 influenza pandemic and compare the infections to the course of COVID-19.The first publicly reported case of Influenza in Winnipeg was on Oct. 1, 1918. "Spanish 'Flu' here," the Manitoba Free Press proclaimed on Page 5. By Oct. 12, authorities had already shut down schools and public gathering spaces, such as theatres and meeting halls.The Manitoba Free Press heralds the arrival of the flu on Page 5. (Winnipeg Free Press archives)The initial response to the Spanish flu has one parallel to the response to COVID-19. There were 11 days between the first reported infection and the closure of schools in both 1918 and 2020.How the Spanish flu compares to COVID-19: Lessons learned, answers still being pursuedUniversity of Manitoba history Prof. Esyllt Jones is not surprised by the authorities' rapid move to shut things down 102 years ago."Daily experience with infectious disease was more frequent then than it is now," said Jones, the author of Influenza 1918: Disease, Death, and Struggle in Winnipeg.Diseases such as diphtheria, measles, mumps, whooping cough and tuberculosis were still common."So most public health people of that generation were really quite experienced dealing with issues of transmission," Jones said.University of Manitoba professor Eyllt Jones is an infectious disease historian and has written about the impacts of the 1918-1919 flu pandemic in Canada (Submitted by Esyllt Jones)Despite the early imposition of physical distancing measures in the fall of 1918, the Spanish flu ripped through Winnipeg, home to just under 180,000 people at the time. By Jan. 1, 1919, 12,950 people in Winnipeg were infected.Crowded housing was a significant factor in the rapid spread, Jones said."It's a respiratory disease. It's winter. People are living in crowded living conditions, and when someone gets infected, there's really no way to isolate that person," she said.City of Winnipeg assessment data says homes built prior to 1920 that remain standing have an average living space of just over 1,200 square feet.These homes would have housed on average of 4.6 people under each roof when the influenza epidemic arrived, Statistics Canada says.As of the last census, in 2016, the average Canadian household has almost half as many people. (Jacques Marcoux/CBC)A century ago, there was no scientific ability to test for the virus. Identifying asymptomatic carriers was impossible. This made quarantine guidelines and contact tracing an exercise in futility.As well, there was no such thing as "remote work" 75 years before residential internet service became commonplace. After the end of the First World War, many homes still didn't even have telephones.A second Winnipeg spike of Spanish flu cases, during the spring of 1919, was much smaller relative to the initial local spike. The virus eventually petered out in the Manitoba capital during the summer of 1919.This differs from COVID-19. The initial Winnipeg spike this spring, which was mostly the result of returning international travellers, has been dwarfed by a September wave caused mostly by close-contact and community transmission. Antibiotics would have saved livesAs of Saturday, COVID-19 had claimed the lives of 16 Winnipeggers. In 1919, by the time the Spanish flu had largely run its course in Manitoba, the virus had killed more than 1,200 people in the provincial capital.Deadly 2nd wave of Spanish flu pandemic of 1918 may hold clues for reopening todayDr. Jason Kindrachuk, an associate professor and Canada research chair in emerging viruses at the University of Manitoba, said the higher death toll for the influenza epidemic is no surprise, given the state of medicine and public health a century ago."I say that without minimizing what we're going through with [COVID-19]," said Kindrachuk, who has studied the 1918-20 pandemic and is engaged in COVID-19 research.It's hard to do a comparative analysis of the two pandemics because a number of factors have changed since 1918, he said."In 1918, if there was no underlying immunity, there was no vaccine. There were no therapeutics. Same case we're in with [COVID-19], with the exception that [in 1918] we also didn't have all the additional measures from a health-care standpoint that we have now," he said.Jason Kindrachuk says the Spanish flu was far more lethal than COVID-19 has been thus far because of advances in medicine, epidemiology and public health. (Jaison Empson/CBC)During the Spanish flu epidemic, the vast majority of patients who died were killed by opportunistic bacterial infections that afflicted people whose bodies and immune systems were weakened by influenza, Kindrachuk said.The death toll from the flu would have been reduced dramatically had antibiotics been available. They were not developed for another two decades.Other medical practices also played a role. Ventilators that help people breathe were not yet invented. The regular replacement of fluids via intravenous injection was not a common practice. The use of personal protective equipment by doctors, nurses and aides was rudimentary, at best. (Jacques Marcoux/CBC)Another factor that compounded the challenges within the health-care system was a shortage of experienced medical staff.When the Spanish flu emerged, the First World War was still raging across Europe. More than half of Canada's physicians and thousands of nurses served overseas, the Canadian War Museum says.Health care also wasn't available to everyone in Winnipeg in 1918. Universal health care would not appear for decades.As well, hospitals were often crowded and poorly ventilated."All of that has made it difficult for us to compare back to 100 years ago, because of how quickly health infrastructure and technology have increased," Kindrachuk said."That being said, with all that, we still are at a point where there's a million people that are dead [worldwide]," he said."That is what suggests to me that, yes, the numbers paint one picture of 1918, but certainly we have to be appreciative of all these variables that we actually have at our disposal and we're still facing a difficult situation."A map shows Winnipeg flu fatalities in 1918.

The multimedia campaign announced on Tuesday will utilize television and social media, according to the Maryland Department of Health (MDH). “Getting vaccinated for the flu every year is important, but this year it’s critical,” said MDH Secretary Robert R. Neall. “Make sure you make time to get your flu shot — it’s a simple, safe and effective way to help protect yourself, your loved ones and the most vulnerable in your community from the flu.” During last year’s flu season, almost 4,000 influenza-associated hospitalizations and 82 influenza-associated deaths were reported to the MDH. Six of the deaths were individuals under the age of 18. Health experts are concerned that flu season and the continued impact of COVID-19 will prove to be a challenging combination for hospitals and medical workers to keep up with. Some flu symptoms–like fever, coughing, and more–are shared with COVID-19, making it difficult to determine without proper testing. “Though we do not yet have a vaccine for COVID-19, the flu vaccine is widely available,” said MDH Acting Deputy Secretary of Public Health Dr. Jinlene Chan. According to the MDH, the flu vaccine is recommended for everyone over the age of six months. Like with COVID-19, certain individuals are at a higher risk for severe influenza complications: children six months through five years old, people over 50 years old, and people with underlying health conditions.

This week’s column seems much too timely, given the state of things today, but it was our determination that the following information may prove useful to the public. What we’ve selected for today are excerpts from a lengthy interview which ran in the Bridgton News on Oct. 18, 1918, in which the then Surgeon General of the United States gave his official recommendations for identifying, avoiding and surviving the then worldwide Spanish Flu epidemic. Lest we forget, the context of this article, the Spanish flu killed three people in Bridgton that week alone. Dozens of our citizens would die over the following months, with hundreds of recorded infections in Bridgton during the close of 1918. While the Spanish Flu hit our community far harder than the present virus is doing, it is striking to consider how similar our response was as compared to our present guidelines. Accordingly, we have selected several highlights from the interview for your consideration. Stay safe! Uncle Sam’s Advice on Flu U.S. Public Health Service Issues Official Health Bulletin on Influenza Latest Word on Subject Washington, D.C. — Special — Although King Alfonso of Spain was one of the victims of the influenza epidemic in 1893 and again this summer, Spanish authorities repudiate any claim to influenza as a “Spanish” disease. If the people of this country do not take care, the epidemic will become so widespread throughout the United States that soon we shall hear the disease called ‘American’ influenza. In response to a request for definite information concerning Spanish influenza, Surgeon General Rupert Blue of the U.S. Public Health Service has authorized the following official interview: What is Spanish influenza? Is it something new? Does it come from Spain? “The disease now occurring in this country and called Spanish Influenza resembles a very contagions kind of ‘cold,’ accompanied by fever, pains in the head, eyes, ears, back or other parts of the body and a feeling of severe sickness. In most of the cases, the symptoms disappear after three or four days, the patient then rapidly recovering. Some of the patients, however, develop pneumonia, or inflammation of the ear, or meningitis, and many of these complicated cases die. Whether this so-called ‘Spanish’ influenza is identical with the epidemics of influenza of early years is not yet known. Epidemics of influenza have visited this country since 1647. It is interesting to know that this first epidemic was brought here from Valencin, Spain. Since that time, there have been numerous epidemics of the disease. In 1889 and 1890, an epidemic of influenza, starting somewhere in the Orient, spread first to Russia and thence over practically the entire civilized world. Three years later, there was another flare-up of the disease. Both times, the epidemic spread widely over the United States. How can the Spanish Influenza be recognized? “There is as yet no certain way in which a single case of Spanish Influenza can be recognized. On the other hand, recognition is easy where there is a group of cases. In contrast to the outbreaks of ordinary coughs and colds, which usually occur in the cold months, epidemics of influenza may occur at any season of the year. Thus, the present epidemic raged most intensely in Europe in May, June and July. Moreover, in the case of ordinary colds, the general symptoms (fever, pain, depression) are by no means as severe or as sudden in their onset as they are in influenza. Finally, ordinary colds do not spread through the community so rapidly or so extensively as does influenza.” What is the course of the disease? Do people die of it? “Ordinarily, the fever lasts from three to four days and the patient recovers. But while the proportion of deaths in the present epidemic has generally been low, in some places the outbreak has been severe and deaths have been numerous. When death occurs, it is usually the result of a complication. No matter what particular kind of germ causes the epidemic, it is now believed that influenza is always spread from person to person, the germs being carried with the air along with the very small droplets of mucous expelled by coughing or sneezing, forceful talking, and the like by one who already has the germs of the disease. They may also be carried about in the air from coughing or sneezing, or from careless people who spit on the floor and on the sidewalk. As in most other catching diseases, a person who has only a mild attack of the disease himself may give a very severe attack to others.” What should be done by those who catch the disease? “It is very important that every person who become sick with influenza should go home at once and go to bed. This will help keep away dangerous complications and will, at the same time, keep the patient from scattering the disease far and wide. It is highly desirable that no one be allowed to sleep in the same room with the patient. In fact, no one but the nurse should be allowed in the room. If there is cough and sputum or running of the eyes and nose, care should be taken that all such discharges are collected on bits of gauze or rag or paper napkins and burned. Only such medicines should be given as prescribed by the doctor. It is foolish to ask the druggist to prescribe and may be dangerous to take the so called ‘safe, sure and harmless’ remedies advertised by patent medicine manufacturers. If the patient is so situated that he can be attended only by someone who must look after others in the family, it is advisable that such attendant wear a wrapper, apron or gown over the ordinary house clothes while in the sick room and slip this off when leaving to look after the others. Nurses and attendants will do well to guard against breathing in dangerous disease germs by wearing a simple fold of gauze or mask while near the patient.” How can one guard against influenza? So far, as a disease like influenza is concerned, health authorities everywhere recognize the very close relation between its spread and overcrowded homes. While it is not always possible, especially in times like the present, to avoid such overcrowding, people should consider the health danger and make every effort to reduce the home overcrowding to a minimum. The value of fresh air through open windows cannot be overemphasized. When crowding is unavoidable, as in street cars, care should be taken to keep the face so turned as not to inhale directly the air breather out by another person. It is especially important to be aware of the person who coughs or sneezes without covering his mouth and nose. It also follows that one should keep out of crowds and stuffy places as much as possible, keep homes, offices and workshops well aired, spend some time out of doors each day, walk to work if at all practicable — in short, make every possible effort to breathe as much pure air as possible. In all heath matters, follow the advice of your doctor and obey the regulations of your local and state health officers. In our view, “words of wisdom” these still are. Till next time!

Could this era of social distancing hasten its demise?It was the first time the Sapanawa tribe had ever made contact.The meeting occurred in the remote Serra do Divisor National Park – a vast area of the Amazon basin in the far west of Brazil. From the sky, it looks like a uniform stretch of unbroken forest; concealed beneath are waterfalls, rivers, dormant volcanos and human villages. This is a place where giant armadillos, tapirs and jaguars roam the landscape, and uncontacted peoples live largely as they have done for some 32,000 years. But for one isolated tribe, everything changed in 2014. Several members of the Sapanawa strayed out of their time warp after fleeing violent attacks from logging gangs across the border in Peru. They raided the village of another remote tribe, who had settled down and made contact with modern civilisation decades ago. Afterwards, they spent three weeks in the company of FUNAI, a government body that protects indigenous people from the outside world.Indigenous Amazonians are anomalies in almost every way – they speak ancient, little-known languages, some of which lack words for numbers and even colours. Their societies are often egalitarian. And they are also among the only communities on Earth not to suffer from the diseases which plague the rest of humanity. Some uncontacted peoples – though not all – have never experienced the misery of having a cold or the flu, or other more life-threatening illnesses such as measles.For the Sapanawa, this fragile disease-free state ended remarkably quickly after their first contact. Within days, many became gravely unwell; they had caught a respiratory infection, probably influenza. When tribes are first exposed to the flu, the fatality rate is usually extremely high. But on this occasion, there was a happy ending. The raiders received medical treatment and no one died, so after a brief period of quarantine, they returned home to their people. As far as anyone knows, this was the end of that flu epidemic.You might also like:Why some vaccines are doubly beneficialHow the first vaccine was bornThe warp-speed vaccine plan that failedThe presence of flu-free societies raises an important question: could the rest of the world ever be rid of this virus? As it happens, the world is making some tantalising first steps towards this goal.Back in January 2020, at the end of the Australian summer, the country had 6,962 cases of the flu confirmed via a laboratory test. At this time, Covid-19 was still known only as “the novel coronavirus” and mostly confined to China. Ordinarily, you would have expected to see more and more cases of the flu as the days became shorter and winter descended.Getty ImagesThe tribes who lived the rainforests of the Amazon were untouched by flu until Spanish colonisers arrived (Credit: Getty Images)Instead, something unexpected happened. By April there were just 229 cases of the flu – down from 18,705 at the same time the previous year. Covid-19 had already ripped across the world, collectively infecting more than a million people, including the British prime minister, and spreading to every continent except Antarctica. Lockdowns had been imposed, hand-washing had been popularised and mask-wearing had become commonplace – though the latter was still much more widely practiced in Asia than elsewhere.By August, it was clear that Australia’s flu season had been the mildest on record. In all, there were fewer than a 10th of the infections seen in 2019 – and the vast majority of these occurred before the pandemic hit. This is all against a backdrop of more testing than had ever been conducted before.The same pattern also occurred elsewhere. The co-head of South Africa’s National Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICD) recently told CBS News that the country “just didn't have a flu season this year”, while in New Zealand, doctors didn’t detect a single flu case during their annual screening drive, though last year 57% of the swabs they took were positive. Many experts suspect that the trend is down to physical distancing and improvements to hygiene in the wake of the pandemicNow winter is over in the Southern Hemisphere and beginning in the North. And though it’s still early in the season, already things look radically different to how they ordinarily would.As of September, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported the missing flu cases were a global phenomenon, with significantly lower levels than would be expected, from tropical Africa to the Caribbean. For the week beginning 7 September, the flu tracker FluMart recorded just 12 lab-confirmed cases of the flu on the entire planet. “What we’re seeing in Australia, New Zealand, South America, Hong Kong, are really, really attenuated seasons of not just the flu, but also respiratory syncytial virus (RSV),” says Sarah Cobey, an epidemiologist at the University of Chicago. Of course, there are many possible reasons that cases might be down this year. People could be afraid to seek medical treatment, and in some places, there it’s possible that fewer tests were conducted as resources were diverted elsewhere. But many experts suspect that the trend is down to physical distancing and improvements to hygiene in the wake of the pandemic.Getty ImagesA universal flu vaccine might give us immunity to the disease no matter how much it mutates from season to season (Credit: Getty Images)“We don't really understand it, but it may have to and may have to do with a little bit of changes in terms of how we interact with each other,” says Peter Palese, a microbiologist and expert in RNA viruses at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York. “There is a possibility this might also continue in the future.”This raises a number of questions. How is this new scarcity of flu affecting the virus? Is it even theoretically possible that it could permanently disappear? And have any other viruses been affected?Humanity hasn’t always lived with the flu. It’s thought that we caught it from the first domesticated birds around 10,000 years ago, when people started to move away from hunter-gathering and switched to farming. For millennia, it was confined to the Old World, before eventually spreading to the Americas with the first European colonisers, who also brought with them a smorgasbord of additional diseases, including smallpox, measles, bubonic plague, malaria, leprosy, chickenpox, mumps, typhus, cholera, diphtheria and yellow fever.None of these pathogens were permanently eliminated until 8 May 1980, when the World Health Assembly officially declared the world free of smallpox. The only other human pathogen that’s ever been pushed to extinction is Sars. The first effort relied on vaccination – and the second on contact-tracing. Unfortunately, neither approach is currently applicable to the flu.Even if we could eliminate the virus entirely from the developed world, since we lack long-term immunity all it would take is a single case for it to come right back“The big problem with influenza is that it changes,” says Palese. The virus is always evolving, so our immune systems are never able to recognise the virus for long after we’ve cleared an infection – and as everyone knows, this means we can be infected again and again; by one estimate, the flu affects up to 10% of the global population every year.Which brings us to the bad news. On its own, social distancing is extremely unlikely to push the flu to extinction. “We have to really think here worldwide,” says Palese. “And even if all of the UK, the US and China wear masks, that doesn't mean that the rest of the world does it. And from what we have seen on television, not everyone in the US wears a mask.” Despite the low number of cases recorded this year, he explains that there will still be pockets of society where the virus is spreading as normal.Even if we could eliminate the virus entirely from the developed world, since we lack long-term immunity all it would take is a single case for it to come right back. “Humans are distributed in such a way that flu viruses can do that – they just keep hopping around different populations without going extinct,” says Cobey.Getty ImagesBecause of the pace at which the flu evolves, current vaccines typically only protect people for around six months (Credit: Getty Images)However, this might not always be the case.Because of the pace at which the flu evolves, current vaccines typically only protect people for around six months. To achieve these impressive feats of evasion, the virus relies mostly on “antigenic drift”, where a gradual build-up of mutations that affect the head of a viral particle – the part that’s usually recognised by the immune system – eventually change it enough so that it can no longer be identified as a threat.This change typically occurs while it’s overwintering, so that it can hop back across to the opposite end of the globe once the season is over. (People who live near the equator are also infected at regular intervals, though these can occur year-round, rather than seasonally). At the moment, new vaccines must be developed every year, to match the viruses that are expected to circulate next; the composition of the Northern Hemisphere vaccine is decided in February, while the makeup of the Southern Hemisphere vaccine is chosen in September.Enter the “universal flu vaccine” – a vaccine that you would only need once, and could protect you against all types of the flu, year after year. With such a tool, it would be possible to enact a mass vaccination programme and consign the flu to history. Right now, scientists across the globe are racing to achieve this goal – and after decades of research, we’re inching closer.The challenge of a universal vaccine is to nudge the immune system in the right directionBack in the 1980s, Palese and colleagues discovered that unlike the fickle “head” of the virus, the “stalk” is remarkably consistent – so antibodies that matched the stalk of one strain could also bind to – and therefore identify – others. The body can produce these antibodies naturally, but the head is larger and more striking, so the immune system tends to focus on identifying it and the stalk gets overlooked.The challenge of a universal vaccine is to nudge the immune system in the right direction.This is exactly what the not-so-catchily titled “H1ssF_3928” has been designed to do. In animal trials, the vaccine has already shown that it can provide immunity to H5N1 – also known as “bird flu” – though it was made from the stalk of H1N1, or swine flu. Now it’s in the first stage of human trials, in which people will be vaccinated and then monitored to see what kind of antibodies they produce. H1ssF_3928 is just one of many potential universal vaccines currently in development which, if they’re successful, could be rolled out worldwide.But even here, there’s a catch.The issue is that there isn’t just one flu virus – today the flu is a many-headed beast, with four main strains which circulate every year; two belong to the group influenza A, which is also found in other animals, while two belong to the group influenza B, which is only found in humans and seals. Occasionally, non-human flu A viruses will take the leap to infecting us, and cause a pandemic – such as the 1918 and 2009 strains, both of which may have come from pigs.Getty ImagesAntarctica is the only continent on Earth that has escaped the coronavirus - so far (Credit: Getty Images)“A universal flu vaccine will only eradicate flu B, not flu A,” says Palese, who explains that even if you were to hunt down all of the flu A currently circulating in humans, new strains could still cross over from the reservoir in wild and domesticated animals. “So in terms of influenza A, we would have to constantly vaccinate the entire population, which is basically impossible. And if we don't do that, then animal strains, as I said, those in reindeer, those in chickens, those in pigs, those in horses, they can jump into humans.”Palese gives the example of smallpox, which had the ideal features for elimination – the virus evolved slowly, and it had no animal hosts. Even with these advantages, it took nearly 200 years of vaccination to push it to extinction.But though the flu is unlikely to disappear completely any time soon, the current pandemic might be affecting the virus in other ways. Here there are two possible scenarios – one of which is a lot more desirable than the other.Getty ImagesThe flu infects millions of people every year and has a huge economic impact (Credit: Getty Images)First up, the virus might be evolving more slowly than usual. This matters, because it means the strains we see next year wouldn’t be too dissimilar to the ones that circulated last year, and infections might be relatively mild. “I was talking about that with a colleague of mine recently,” says Cobey. “What's hard about influenza is that it's always evolving into something new that we've never ever seen before. And so it's actually very hard to say, ‘if things were a little bit different, it would evolve like this’, because it's kind of so unpredictable to begin with. But this could be really good – it’s exciting,” says Cobey. “It's really simple,” says Palese. “If there’s less virus around, fewer mutations happen.” He explains that if you have 10,000 infected people, statistically speaking you would expect 10 mutations to emerge. So if you had just a thousand, you would expect a 10th of that number. Theoretically, anything that affects the amount of virus circulating should affect its evolution – even the flu vaccines that are currently available. “If Bill Gates [the billionaire philanthropist and co-founder of Microsoft, who has helped to fund the eradication of polio] would pay for it, and then 95% of people would agree to have it, then I think that kind of immune protection would then result in a different Darwinian selection,” he says. “But on the other hand, only around 5% of the world population gets vaccinated,” says Palese.If there’s less virus around, fewer mutations happen – Peter PaleseHowever, there is another possibility.In reality, we don’t know for sure if social distancing has led to fewer flu infections worldwide – or just the number recorded. If it hasn’t, the rate of its evolution might be largely unchanged. This would mean that next year – when social distancing may have been largely abandoned – parts of the world that currently have fewer flu cases could be hit hard.“If there's no transmission of other respiratory pathogens, that means people are not getting immunity to them,” says Cobey. “One thing I really am worried about is what will happen to these other pathogens once there’s a [Covid-19] vaccine.”Cobey suggests that, instead of focusing our efforts entirely on developing a vaccine, it would be helpful to take the opportunity to invest in the types of prevention and treatment that can also work against other respiratory pathogens, such as improvements in hygiene and access to ventilators. “So that maybe when we have that vaccine, we don't have to go back to exactly how things were before,” she says.Palese, on the other hand, is keen to stress the importance of getting vaccinated against the flu. “Even if it is not completely protective, it is certainly resulting in a more mellow disease – and it’s a very safe vaccine,” he says.Crucially, scientists don’t yet know what happens when people are infected with Covid-19 and the flu at the same time. “We really don't know.

View: Text | PDF Research Article Immunology Infectious disease Landscape of coordinated immune responses to H1N1 challenge in humans Text PDF Abstract Influenza is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Here we show changes in the abundance and activation states of more than 50 immune cell subsets in 35 individuals over 11 time points during human A/California/2009 (H1N1) virus challenge monitored using mass cytometry along with other clinical assessments. Peak change in monocyte, B cell, and T cell subset frequencies coincided with peak virus shedding, followed by marked activation of T and NK cells. Results led to the identification of CD38 as a critical regulator of plasmacytoid dendritic cell function in response to influenza virus. Machine learning using study-derived clinical parameters and single-cell data effectively classified and predicted susceptibility to infection. The coordinated immune cell dynamics defined in this study provide a framework for identifying novel correlates of protection in the evaluation of future influenza therapeutics.

(WSFA) - In preparation for an eventual roll out of the COVID-19 vaccine, the state of Alabama is receiving a larger number of influenza vaccines this year.According to State Health Officer Dr. Scott Harris, the state will be receiving somewhere between 10 to 15 times the number of influenza vaccines than normal. The vaccinations will be available through county health departments and other providers.The unusually large scale flu vaccination effort is meant to serve as a dry run for how the COVID-19 vaccine will be distributed and made available.“Flu season serves as an opportunity for us to not only roll out the flu vaccine, because we need to do that, but it also serves as a good way to plan for how we might roll out a COVID vaccine,” Harris said.The large amount of flu vaccines being shipped to the state will also be greatly needed as health experts push for more people to get immunized.“We’re using the number of doses to get ready for COVID, but we also really want people to take the flu vaccine,” Harris said. “We say that every year, but this year more than ever.”“I think that more people will take the flu vaccine this year than have ever taken it before, understanding that it’s a virus and is somewhat similar to what we are dealing with now with COVID-19," said Dr. William Saliski, Montgomery-area Pulmonologist.According to the CDC, vaccine manufacturers have projected that they will supply as many as 194 to 198 million doses of influenza vaccine for the 2020-2021 season. The CDC says the flu vaccination will be very important to reduce flu because it can help reduce the overall impact of respiratory illnesses on the population and thus lessen the resulting burden on the healthcare system during the COVID-19 pandemic.After all, this will be the first time the state is tackling both COVID-19 and the flu.“Having these two things at the same time is a concern,” Harris said. “We want to make sure, more than ever, we’re pushing influenza vaccines to anyone who is a candidate to take it.”Health experts say the ability to contract both COVID-19 and the flu at the same time is possible.“I don’t see any reason why you couldn’t get both,” Dr. Saliski said. " I myself have not seen anyone with both at the same time, but I’m sure it’s probably going to be possible."With flu shots being even more readily available this year, doctors say their is no excuse not to get vaccinated.“You want the maximum amount of protection you can get to not get the flu,” Saliski said. “Wearing a mask, social distancing, all of the things you can do to prevent COVID will be the exact same for the flu. So absolutely the flu vaccine is paramount of importance to prevent the flu.”The flu season in Alabama runs from October through May. The Department of Public Health recommends an annual flu shot for every person six months or older, with rare exceptions.As of Oct. 15, there have been nearly 169,000 cases of COVID-19 in Alabama and more than 2,700 deaths according to the Alabama Department of Public Death.

Public health officials worry, with good reason, that it will strain America’s health care system as cases of COVID-19 are climbing again in some states.“We could see a rise in influenza anytime between now and February,” Dr. Teresa Everson, health officer for Yakima County, said during the Sept. 30 county health board meeting.The contagious respiratory illness spreads through coughing, sneezing and close contact. It can cause mild to severe illness, but it can also be fatal.The best way to prevent it is to get a flu vaccine. Everson and other officials with the Yakima Health District stress that’s more important than ever this year during the pandemic. The health district has started tracking flu statistics on its website along with the COVID-19 statistics it’s been keeping since mid-March.“Please, everyone, get your influenza vaccines,” Everson said at the board meeting. “Influenza does kill, so please remember to get your influenza vaccines.”A large surge in influenza cases strained Yakima County’s health care providers in December 2019. That month, Virginia Mason Memorial hospital in Yakima saw a record number of patients visit the emergency department. Hospital officials said early this year it was related to influenza, both A and B strains. At Astria Regional Medical Center in Yakima — which closed early this year — there were 224 positive cases of influenza A or B throughout the month, according to a registered nurse in the infection prevention quality management department.“It’s especially important to be prepared for flu season this year to help health care systems across the country keep their focus on combating the global pandemic,” said Lori Kelley, senior director of quality for the Yakima Valley Farm Workers Clinic.Those at high risk of serious flu complications include young children, pregnant women, those with chronic health conditions and people ages 65 and older. They’re also at risk of complications from COVID-19. The flu prevention page on the Yakima Health District website has a chart showing some of the differences between the flu, COVID-19, colds and allergies.Anybody age 6 months and older can get a flu vaccine, which causes antibodies to develop about two weeks after vaccination. The antibodies protect against infection.Rite Aid, Walgreens and Safeway pharmacies are among large national chains offering seasonal flu shots in the Yakima area. Rite Aid ordered 40% more vaccine doses this year, according to a news release. Appointments aren’t necessary at those locations, and flu shots are free with most insurance, so there is no co-payment unless required by the plan.Prosser Memorial Health is offering flu vaccines at all its primary care clinics. It also offers the flu vaccine to inpatients if they haven’t yet received it. Flu shots are provided at Astria Health centers in the Yakima Valley, and Virginia Mason Memorial is offering flu shots to patients at its clinics.“VMM has always strongly encouraged influenza vaccinations for everyone 6 months and older. The only difference this flu season is the additional precautions we’re taking for COVID and the conversion of some of our flu clinics to drive-through immunizations,” said Dr. Tanny Davenport, physician executive of medical group operations at Virginia Mason Memorial.The Yakima Health District’s flu prevention page has a map of flu shot providers along with lists of pharmacy flu shot locations, school immunization flu clinics and state Department of Health flu-related news.Here are more resources for getting flu shots:Yakima Valley Farm Workers ClinicSites across the Yakima Valley are offering flu shots for patients and community members. Those who get flu shots don’t have to be Farm Workers Clinic patients. Appointments are required and flu shots cost $20.

The second will take place from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. Oct. 21 at Wapato Middle School, 1309 Kateri Lane, Wapato.The clinics aren’t free; people need to bring proof of insurance.

They have broad access to patient populations, they have extended hours—obviously pharmacies are open a long time&mdash;they have ready access to patients, they have a trusted relationship with many of their patients, and they have direct access to the medical community, to doctors’ offices, to hospitals, to nurses. And, you know, with the emergency declaration that has been promulgated by Secretary Azar, currently poised to be in effect until October 1 of 2024&mdash;not that that wouldn't change, it's a long time [on the] horizon though&mdash;this provides an invaluable built-in runway and a pilot to demonstrate that pharmacists can be independently capable of administering a broad swath of vaccines without any bureaucratic hoops and hurdles and inter-professional oversight, such as delegation by other prescribers and standing orders.Frankly, I might add it shouldn't stop there: Pharmacists should be able to assist the patient with infusions, with injections, such as B12, immunomodulating drugs, lifestyle drugs. You know, there's a lot of opportunity there for pharmacists to be involved directly on the front lines—very accessible professionals [that are] extremely knowledgeable, and it's really sort of an untapped resource, even though pharmacy has been pushing for its own independence. I think this presents a real opportunity for us pharmacists to move the needle.Alana Hippensteele: Absolutely. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today, Ned.

View: Text | PDF Research Article Immunology Infectious disease Landscape of coordinated immune responses to H1N1 challenge in humans Text PDF Abstract Influenza is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Here we show changes in the abundance and activation states of more than 50 immune cell subsets in 35 individuals over 11 time points during human A/California/2009 (H1N1) virus challenge monitored using mass cytometry along with other clinical assessments. Peak change in monocyte, B cell, and T cell subset frequencies coincided with peak virus shedding, followed by marked activation of T and NK cells. Results led to the identification of CD38 as a critical regulator of plasmacytoid dendritic cell function in response to influenza virus. Machine learning using study-derived clinical parameters and single-cell data effectively classified and predicted susceptibility to infection. The coordinated immune cell dynamics defined in this study provide a framework for identifying novel correlates of protection in the evaluation of future influenza therapeutics.

(Stu Mills/CBC)Social SharingAn estimated 61,000 long-stay home-care clients in Ontario and thousands more across Canada did not get a flu shot in 2019, researchers at the University of Waterloo have found.John Hirdes, professor at the School of Public Health and Health Systems, said the number for Ontario is 18,000 more than the 2007 figure, when around 43,000 long-stay home-care clients did not get a flu shot.He said the issue is critical now as the country grapples with "wave two" of the COVID-19 pandemic. "One reason for that is, if we can protect people against influenza, that may help them to be a bit stronger if they get infected with COVID," Hirdes told CBC News."The other is, by giving people the flu shot, we can keep them out of the emergency department, so that reduces pressure on the emergency department so they are not dealing with two viral outbreaks."Also, because there are so many similarities between the two conditions, if we get people the flu shot and can prevent the flu, then at least it may help in reducing some confusion of whether we're dealing with the flu or COVID in cases where people are infected," Hirdes added.Study covered Alberta, BC, Ontario and Newfoundland The study, which covered Alberta, BC, Ontario and Newfoundland in Canada, also included Belgium, New Zealand and the United States. It included individuals living in their communities who need on-going supports from the government's home-care system.According to the study, the rate of not being vaccinated for influenza in long-stay home-care clients is as follows: Ontario — 28.3 per cent. BC — 27.6 per cent. Alberta — 23.2 per cent. Newfoundland — 34.9 per cent. "These are all frail, elderly people. They are very vulnerable to the effects of influenza so they definitely should be getting the flu shot," Hirdes said.John Hirdes, professor at the University of Waterloo School of Public Health and Health Systems. (Submitted by Julie Koreck)Noting that Ontario "used to do OK" where only about 20 per cent of long-stay home-care clients did not get a flu shot in 2007, Hirdes said it's "worrisome" that things have gotten worse over time.Dr. Samir Sinha, director of geriatrics for Mount Sinai Hospital and the University Health Network in Toronto, said he's not surprised by the findings.The coming flu season could make the pandemic worse. Is Canada ready for it?He noted that while the Public Health Agency of Canada has recommended at least 80 per cent of Canadians get the flu shot, that target is not being met."We're not even reaching that target amongst older Canadians and Canadians in general," Sinha told CBC News. "And that's concerning, because if we don't actually reach 80 per cent vaccination levels, we don't create a situation that we call herd immunity, meaning that if flu is circulating around, it's less likely to spread from one person to the other if 80 per cent of our population for example is immune, either by having recovered from the flu that year, or having received the flu vaccination that protects people from that strain of the flu."Dr. Samir Sinha heads geriatric medicine at Toronto's Mount Sinai Hospital. He says while the Public Health Agency of Canada has recommended that at least 80 per cent of Canadians get the flu shot, that target is not being met. (CBC)Most governments have made the flu vaccine freely available and accessible, even in places like pharmacies across the country. The vaccine is available for anyone who is six months or older."The challenge is that for the type of person that John and his team is studying, these tend to be people who are functionally homebound," Sinha explained. "These are folks for example who can't really get out to see their doctor, can't easily get out to see their pharmacist."They are often people who are getting their medication delivered from the pharmacy to them at home. And because these folks have challenges getting out of the house, it just creates an additional challenge or barrier for them to actually get vaccinated," Sinha added. 'Quite a bit of bureaucracy involved,' Hirdes saysMeanwhile, Hirdes said home-care based clinicians need to urgently have a conversation with their clients to make them aware why they should be getting a flu shot — especially now that we are in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic."The role of the home-care nurse is to encourage them and make them aware of the options. One of the things that we need to think about is can we simplify things to make it easier for home-care service providers to also provide the flu shot," Hirdes said."Right now there is quite a bit of bureaucracy involved in this where home-care providers would have to ask to get flu doses from public health. "A home-care nurse doesn't carry it around in a small black bag so we need to think about ways to make it more convenient and easy to get flu shots to frail, elderly people in their homes," he added. (John Hirdes)In August Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, stressed the months ahead will be a "period of challenge" given the combination of COVID-19 and influenza.VideoGetting the flu shot will look a bit different in B.C. this yearLast month, Tam said preparations for administering this year's flu vaccine is a "good rehearsal" for any COVID-19 vaccine.The National Institute on Ageing has published a White Paper related to the issues of influenza in Canada. The findings include: Influenza (and pneumonia) is the seventh leading cause of death in Canada, and it is the leading cause of death among vaccine-preventable diseases. Influenza has been reported to cause an average of 12,200 hospitalizations and 3,500 related deaths each year in Canada. The influenza vaccination rate for older adults is only 62 per cent, well below the Health Canada target of 80 per cent needed for population immunity. In provinces where pharmacists are allowed to administer the influenza vaccine, more Canadians get vaccinated. Influenza leads to an estimated 1.5 million lost work days each year. Despite making some progress in promoting vaccination uptake, Canada still lags behind other countries like the United States and Britain. (National Institute on Ageing)It's not too lateHirdes said it is not too late to get the vaccine to the thousands of long-stay home-care patients who did not get one last year."We're just starting to get vaccinations going with this and so this is the time for the system to work. If this was April or May in 2021 it would be too late, but now is the time," Hirdes told CBC News."The advantage that we've got is that the home-care agencies in the province have a complete list of all their clients who did not get a flu shot, so it's actually very easy for them with their electronic health records to identify which of their clients did not get a flu shot and to reach out to them to encourage them to get a flu shot.No one's talking about winter yet. When it comes to COVID-19, here's why we should'Significant increase' in number of new COVID-19 cases among under-20s in Ontario, study finds"We serve about 200,000 home-care clients in the province a year so it's a manageable problem. These are people that are on the roster for home-care agencies — they can easily with their electronic health records identify who those folks are … it's not going to be that hard to reach them," Hirdes added.

[Vaxxas] A ‘Patch’-Work Solution to Vaccine Delivery With $22M from BARDA, Vaxxas plans clinical trials of needle-free vaccination approach for diseases starting with flu and possibly, COVID-19 By Alex Philippidis October 14, 2020 With $22 million from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), Vaxxas plans to advance clinical development of its proprietary High Density Micro-Array Patch (HD-MAP) non-invasive vaccination platform in response to pandemic threats to public health. [Vaxxas] Vaxxas President and CEO David L. Hoey discusses HD-MAP with GEN in a recent Zoom interview. Fear of needles has long been a driver of resistance to vaccines, no matter a patient’s age: A 2012 study found 24% of adults and 63% of children expressing that fear, while a 2018 meta-analysis of 35 studies showed that among grown-ups, avoidance of influenza vaccination because of needle fear occurred in 16% of adult patients, 27% of hospital employees, 18% of workers at long‐term care facilities, and 8% of healthcare workers at hospitals. Those and other needle-avoiding patients may be more likely to accept and receive vaccines through an alternative approach developed over nearly a decade by Vaxxas, an Australian company with commercial operations in Cambridge, MA. Earlier this month, Vaxxas won $22 million from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) toward advancing clinical development of its proprietary High Density Micro-Array Patch (HD-MAP) non-invasive vaccination platform in response to pandemic threats to public health. The contract from BARDA (75A50120C00180) will fund an upcoming Phase I clinical validation study designed to evaluate HD-MAP for pandemic influenza in 420 people, using both unadjuvanted and adjuvanted vaccine formulations. BARDA is footing most of the trial’s $24.1 million cost, with Vaxxas contributing the remaining 8.5% or $2.1 million. Vaxxas said pandemic influenza vaccine was selected for the validation study in order to generate a comprehensive baseline of immune responses and safety data for HD-MAP when used for pandemic preparedness and response. However, Vaxxas adds that it is actively investigating opportunities to apply HD-MAP toward improving the performance of vaccines for other pandemics—including against COVID-19. HD-MAP uses an ultra-high density 9x9mm array consisting of thousands of projections that are approximately ~250µm and thus invisible to the naked human eye, coated with vaccine. That vaccine is applied to the skin for rapid delivery to the immune cells immediately below the skin surface. “A Smarter Way” “It’s just a smarter way to deliver vaccines,” Vaxxas President and CEO David L. Hoey told GEN. “There aren’t too many people that like a needle. So if you’re a patient, you’ll enjoy the fact that it’s a patch.” Vaxxas’ HD-MAP packaging Hoey said HD-MAP can enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of immune response. HD-MAP requires smaller concentrations of vaccine than the traditional needle and syringe, which can save vaccine developers on production costs and time needed to distribute doses. Also, the dry vaccine formulation contained in the patches does not need refrigeration, allowing for rapid distribution using commercial shipping carriers such as the U.S. Postal Service, UPS, or FedEx. “What we’re trying to do is essentially put the vaccine antigen right amongst those populations of immune cells. In contrast, by needle and syringe, when you are putting it into the muscle, essentially, the vaccine is wandering around. It will get picked up systemically, and sooner or later it’ll bump into an immune cell that will bring it to a lymph node for processing,” Hoey explained. “What we do is we started trying to almost target lymphatic delivery. So by putting the vaccine just under the surface of the skin the vaccine antigen is picked up by the dendritic cells and taken very efficiently and effectively to lymph nodes.” Vaxxas says it has developed a prototype of a compact manufacturing system designed to deliver more than 250 million vaccine doses per year. Hoey said the company expects its first HD-MAP vaccine to reach the market within five or six years, with plans to build a portfolio of vaccine products afterward. “This can be a technology in the tool belt that has the potential to be used across a whole range of different vaccines, that just fundamentally improves every aspect of response,” Hoey said. “I’d like to think that in 20 years, the leading vaccine in every disease category is going to be delivered by this technology because it’s just a fundamentally more sensible way to deliver a vaccine.” Emerging Technologies Vaxxas is among developers of patch-based delivery of drugs and vaccines to emerge in recent years: 3M has developed microneedle drug delivery systems consisting of both solid microneedle technology for delivering vaccines and biologics of up to 300 mcg capacity, as well as hollow microeedle technology designed to deliver liquid biologic formulations of 0.5 mL to 2 mL over a variety of viscosities. Last year, 3M spun out its drug delivery business for $650 million to Altaris Capital Partners, which renamed the business Kindreva Drug Delivery and plans to establish a headquarters in the Minneapolis suburb of Woodbury, MN.Corium has applied its MicroCor® microneedle system to administer Eli Lilly’s osteoporosis Forteo® (teriparatide [rDNA origin] injection), a parathyroid hormone analog, (PTH 1-34), which is indicated for three forms of osteoporosis.CosMED Pharmaceutical has developed a dissolving MAP (D MAP) called MicroHyalaTM, made of hyaluronic acid, and intended for cosmetic products like those designed to combat acne or age spots.Emory University researchers led by Nadine Rouphael, MD, published a study in The Lancet on June 27 detailing their 100-participant Phase I trial (NCT02438423) which showed that a microneedle patch system was safe and just as effective as intramuscular injection in generating immunity against influenza.Zosano Pharma uses a transdermal intracutaneous microneedle system to deliver its acute migraine candidate Qtrypta™ (zolmitriptan). In August, Zosano launched a collaboration of undisclosed value with Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma to study the feasibility of formulating an undisclosed drug being developed by the Japanese pharma for administration in humans using Zosano’s microneedle patch. Vaxxas has evaluated HD-MAP in the largest microarray patch clinical vaccination study ever performed, involving 210 participants as well as researchers from the company and clinical partners including the University of Queensland and University of Melbourne. The study was designed to measure the safety and tolerability of A/Singapore/GP1908/2015 H1N1 (A/Sing) monovalent vaccine delivered by HD-MAP, compared to an uncoated Vaxxas HD-MAP and IM injection of a quadrivalent seasonal influenza vaccine (QIV) delivering approximately the same dose of A/Sing HA protein. Dose-Sparing Potential In that Phase I trial (Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry No. ACTRN12618000112268), detailed in a study published March 17 in PLoS Medicine, the use of HD-MAP to deliver a 2.5 μg dose of vaccine—one-sixth of the standard dose—induced haemagglutination inhibition (HAI) and microneutralization (MN) titers that were similar to those induced by a standard dose of 15 μg injected IM. That result validated the dose-sparing potential of Vaxxas platform, according to Vaxxas. At two higher doses, 10 and 15 µg, HD-MAP was shown to produce significantly high titers and faster onset kinetics than 15 µg injected IM. HD-MAP was also shown to be stable when stored at 40°C (104°F) for at least 12 months. HD-MAPs are prefabricated by injection-moulding of polymer, which will make them less expensive for commercial manufacture than Vaxxas’ original Nanopatch™ system formed from dry-etched monocrystalline silicon. Earlier studies of the Nanopatch showed it to be safe, well tolerated, preferred by recipients to needle and syringe delivery, and able to induce immune responses at least as potent as IM injection. Last year, for example, investigators from Vaxxas and other research partners published a study in the journal Vaccine: X that found the use of the Nanopatch to have induced immune response similar to that of the Mantoux technique for intradermal injection in delivering a dried formulation of unadjuvanted Gardasil™ 9, Merck & Co.’s vaccine for human papillomavirus (HPV), into rhesus macaques. Overall, Hoey said, Vaxxas has published studies assessing its patch platforms in some two dozen different vaccine types. That number will increase in January, when Vaxxas launches a first-in-human clinical trial evaluating HD-MAP’s delivery of measles and rubella vaccines now administered by needle and syringe, using funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The measles and rubella vaccine formulation being used to coat the HD-MAP has been engineered for greater stability at higher temperatures than needed for needle/syringe vaccination. The Gates Foundation in March awarded Vaxxas $5 million toward IND-enabling studies and the first-in-human clinical study, building upon an earlier grant by the foundation of $4.5 million focused on preclinical development. World Exclusive Vaxxas was established in 2011. A year later, it inked a collaboration agreement with Merck granting the pharma giant an option to use HD-MAP. On May 28, Vaxxas announced that Merck had exercised that option, gaining exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize a vaccine using HD-MAP technology. Merck has not disclosed what that vaccine will be, though Hoey said it is expected to enter the clinic in about two years. Vaxxas is carrying out preclinical development designed to provide them with some materials to be used in future clinical studies Merck will conduct. As a result of exercising its option, Merck will pay Vaxxas $12 million consisting of equity funding and option fees associated with the agreement. Vaxxas is also eligible to receive undisclosed future option, development, and commercial milestone payments. Merck has also agreed to oversee clinical development, and fund any requested additional research activities conducted by Vaxxas. Privately-held Vaxxas is based in Brisbane with commercial operations in Cambridge, MA. The company employs about 55 people, and is hiring another 20 now—mostly for manufacturing positions to be created in Brisbane as the company builds out a pilot line for late stage clinical material and early commercial production set to be up and running in about 18 months to two years. Some of the new hires will fill business development positions in Cambridge. “We’re scaling up a bit, so that we will grow to about 75 folks by the end of this year, and probably add something like another 50 during the course of next year,” Hoey said. Since its founding, Vaxxas has raised about A$66 million ($47 million) in financing, plus another A$40 million (nearly $29 million) in non-dilutive funding. “We know we’re in a good position, but we’re about to proceed to build our first manufacturing pilot line, which is an expensive exercise,” Hoey said. “We need to have that in place to start producing the material that we’ll need for our late-stage clinical studies. And even though those are a couple of years away, it takes about 18 months to build your pilot line. It takes about a year to validate it, and then you’ve got to produce it.” That pilot line is the initial effort of an alliance Vaxxas announced in May with Harro Höfliger, a German pharmaceutical process engineering and sterile manufacturing concern. Through their partnership, whose value was not disclosed, Vaxxas and Harro Höfliger committed to develop the world’s first high-throughput aseptic line for vaccine-HD-MAP production, with a capacity of compact modular lines targeted at 5 million units per week. Vaxxas also plans to build a manufacturing facility in the US, Hoey said, adding: “But that’s still a couple of years out.” GEN EdgeClinical developmentClinical trialDrug deliveryPhase I clinical trials (Drug development)Preclinical developmentVaccinesMerck & CoVaxxas Share FacebookTwitterLinkedinReddItEmail Previous articleThe Great Convergence: How Biology and Engineering Unite to Reshape our WorldNext articleWorking with ALS Mice: Guidelines for Preclinical Testing and Colony Management Alex Philippidis Also of Interest StockWatch: Wall Street Weighs Trump Effect on Biopharma, from Vaccines to M&A Patient Dies in Beam Trial of SCD Candidate; Company Cites Conditioning Alzheimer’s Drug Shows Slower Cognitive Decline in Lower Tau Patients Synaffix Collaborates with BigHat Biosciences on the Development of Machine Learning-Designed ADC Improving the Manufacture of mRNA Biologics Navigating the RNA Lipid Nanoparticle Landscape Related Media AACR 2024: A Video Update from San Diego Sickle Cell Salvation: The Victoria Gray Interview Dr. Fauci Reflects on His 54 Year Career at the NIH How’s the Biotechnology Business?

I get one every year, but never this early.I usually wait until the autumn heat wanes and Southern California's version of winter settles in, pushing people and gatherings inside where viruses spread more easily. This year, waiting for winter to get a flu shot seemed as risky as waiting for Nov. 3 to vote. I've had the flu. It's not an experience I wish to repeat ― especially if there's a possibility of suffering from both the flu and COVID-19 at the same time.And in 2020 it is a possibility. This year's flu season is coinciding with what appears to be the start of the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic. Reported cases of COVID-19 in the U.S. have risen over the last week, according to the COVID Tracking Project, setting new records in a handful of states. In Canada, where winter comes earlier than in much of the U.S., authorities say the second wave has already landed.Although health experts don't know how hard the flu will hit this year, the prospect of a "twindemic" has them worried. Health providers are particularly urgent in their flu shot appeals this year, hoping to get their patients immunized before families come together for the holidays to share meals and pathogens.Health authorities now agree that COVID-19 can be spread via aerosols that an infected person exhales (rather than expelling forcefully by a sneeze or cough), imbuing the air with the virus for up to three hours in an unventilated room. Influenza can spread that way too.But even a mild flu season could overburden a medical system straining from COVID-19 cases. Remember the stories about overrun hospitals during the early days of the pandemic? Imagine how much worse things might be with a flu epidemic piled on.In a typical year, millions of people in the U.S. are infected with influenza; over the last decade, hundreds of thousands of flu sufferers have been hospitalized, and between 12,000 and 61,000 people have died. The typical seasonal influenza is not nearly as deadly as COVID-19, but occasionally a particularly lethal strain breaks out of the routine. One of them was the "Spanish flu" of 1918 that killed between 50 million and 100 million people (medical record-keeping wasn't great 100 years ago).And while it's not certain that having influenza makes a subsequent COVID-19 infection more dangerous, some medical professionals suspect that it could. Both viruses attack the respiratory system. They also present with symptoms so similar, it's hard even for physicians to tell them apart without a test.One important difference between the two is that while we are still waiting for a COVID-19 vaccine, we do have one for influenza that's readily available at little or no cost. But astonishingly, less than half of American adults choose to take this simple preventive measure most years. Last year, just 48 percent of adults in the U.S. were immunized against influenza.If you've never gotten a flu shot, this would be the year to start. There's no good reason not to. Manufacturers have ramped up production, and so far 105.5 million doses have been distributed in the U.S., with millions more to come. Health providers are trying to make it safe and easy to get the shots, offering walk-in and drive-up vaccination clinics.Distrust in vaccines in general has been growing in recent years, but there is still a mountain of data that shows all vaccinations are overwhelming safe. And getting a flu shot does not make getting the flu more likely. The shot contains inactive virus and the nasal spray vaccine uses an active fragment too small to make you sick, both of which trigger the creation of antibodies that can help fight off an infection.To be sure, getting a flu shot is no guarantee that you won't get infected. The effectiveness varies from year to year, but the vaccine rarely reduces your chance of getting sick by more than 50 percent. Developing seasonal flu shots is not an exact science because it requires scientists to predict which strain will be circulating far enough in advance that drugmakers can have doses ready by the time the flu season begins. But even if a flu shot doesn't stop an infection, it will make getting the flu less terrible and deadly.That was more than enough for me, even if there weren't another deadly virus circulating out there. And all it cost me was an hour out of one morning (Kaiser is nothing if not efficient in delivering preventive care) ― and a day nursing a sore arm and achy body. That's nothing compared with the alternative.Mariel Garza is an editorial writer for the Los Angeles Times. This article was distributed by Tribune Content Agency.

Japan's National Daily Since 1922 Japanese Contact Us Top Latest Japan World Business Sports Science Entertainment Opinion Lifestyle Obituaries Features Photos Videos Why are this year's death figures in Japan below 2019's despite pandemic? October 12, 2020 (Mainichi Japan) Japanese version A stethoscope is seen in this file photo. (Getty) TOKYO -- Over a million people worldwide have died due to the coronavirus, and as of Oct. 10, 1,628 residents in Japan had passed away because of COVID-19, but official domestic death figures in the country for 2020 are lower than a normal year. According to vital statistics from the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, preliminary results up until July show that some 18,000 fewer people had died in Japan as of July 2020 than they had by the same time last year. So what has been going on in the background to the pandemic? The health ministry's vital statistics are compiled from information on births, deaths, marriages, divorces and other data provided by municipal authorities. The preliminary figures are disclosed two months after the month surveyed, and approximate figures from a monthly vital statistics report on Japanese nationals living in the country are released some five months after the recorded month. The monthly reports are broken down by prefecture, cause of death and age, and the figures from May, when the state of emergency declaration was in effect, were released at the start of October. The health ministry's population survey shows that in 2019, 1,381,093 people died in Japan. Since 2009, when the country saw a fall in deaths compared to the previous year, the number of dead has risen annually by between 17,000 and 33,000 people. But this year is different. According to the monthly report for May, the number of deceased in 2020 by that month was 13,851 lower than the year before. The preliminary figures up to July show that the number deceased was 795,807 people; down 17,998 compared to the 813,805 who had died in the first seven months in 2019. But deaths by what type of diseases declined in 2020? May's breakdown by cause of death shows that up until that month, the greatest drop was seen in patients dying of respiratory illnesses, at 9,066 fewer deaths. Among them, influenza deaths had fallen by 2,270 people, and pneumonia by 5,863. A health ministry official assigned to coronavirus policy posited, "Due to the coronavirus infection prevention measures, this year has also seen fewer cases of other infectious diseases across the board. It seems like cases of respiratory illness caused by infections have fallen because people have been reducing their time outside and avoiding close contact." Looked at monthly, January saw the biggest fall in deaths, with a difference of 8,794 people. Reports of a new infectious disease in Wuhan, China, emerged at the start of the month, and by the middle of January the first patients in Japan had been confirmed, and with them coronavirus vigilance rose. Another month where the numbers fell noticeably was May, with a difference of 3,635 people. At that time, the state of emergency was extended to reduce transmissions, and there was a steep fall in rates of people leaving their homes or traveling. In May, the number of deaths from traffic accidents, falls and unexpected events was down 247 on the year before. An official at the health ministry's Vital, Health and Social Statistics Office told the Mainichi Shimbun, "The reports of vital statistics are collated from surveys filled out by municipal authorities, so it's difficult for us to analyze the reason behind it." But they added that generally, weather can have an effect on falling death totals. In 2009, when there were 542 fewer deaths than the year before, temperatures were high across the country, and around 8,000 fewer people died in February. According to the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), the winter from 2019 to 2020 was the warmest in both west and east Japan since its observations began in 1946, making it a "record warm winter." The official at the social statistics office said, "There isn't just one reason for the fall in deaths; it's a complex range of factors. Experts will probably analyze and evaluate the data in the future." One other point of note is that the number of people dying from circulatory conditions has also fallen. By May, 6,724 fewer people were recorded as losing their lives to circulatory problem-related illnesses, and deaths from heart attacks and strokes were down by 1,608 and 1,318, respectively. How have experts taken the information that so far deaths appear to be down by a wide margin compared to last year? Hiroshi Nishiura, a professor in theoretical epidemiology at Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine who worked on the coronavirus outbreak predictor mathematical models, and who also researches demography, said that he thinks one of the reasons for the drop is that there was no widespread flu outbreak in the winter of 2019-2020. The causes of death noted in the ministry's vital statistics are tallied based on the cause of death surveys, and are categorized based on rules set out by the World Health Organization. Annually, around 3,000 people in Japan die of influenza. But Nishiura said, "It's actually often the case that when a person becomes infected with influenza, not just existing respiratory conditions, but also circulatory, digestive and other chronic conditions worsen to the point that they die." According to the health ministry, if both direct and indirect deaths by influenza are included, the death toll can, depending on the outbreak, be between 250,000 and 500,000 globally, and is reportedly estimated to be around 10,000 people in Japan alone. Nishiura said, "It's come to be said that the number of people dying from causes brought on by influenza is quite high, and these documents have become a way of providing evidence for that argument. In the future, analysis of the figures by month may show us how variables in our living environment, such as stress from exercise and mental health factors, directly affect deaths."

Ⓒ 2024 Dotdash Media, Inc. — All rights reserved NEWS Coronavirus News 5 Ways Hospitals Are Preparing for Flu Season During the COVID-19 Pandemic By Joanne Chen Updated on October 14, 2020 Fact checked by James Lacy Print Marko Geber / Getty Images Close Key Takeaways It's unclear how the flu season will pan out with the pandemic, but hospitals have geared up to accommodate a possibly larger influx of patients.Efficient COVID-19 tests and flu tests and careful isolation strategies have been planned to keep patients safe. As of now, PPE supplies appear stable at major healthcare institutions, though smaller non-hospital facilities continue to wrestle with shortages. It seems like a lifetime ago since the coronavirus pandemic’s early frenetic days, when healthcare workers were overstretched and hospitals across the country were desperate for space, supplies, and support. More than six months in, some regions seem to have the virus under control; others remain in the thick of it, and no one is sure what the next six months, smack in the middle of flu season, will bring. What we do know, though, is that hospitals have had to make some significant changes in the way they’re structured and how they operate. And because of that, hospitals may be in a better position than ever before to fight the one-two punch of a "twindemic," should it, in fact, occur. Here’s what they’re doing. Spreading the Word About the Flu Shot It’s unclear what kind of flu season we’ll have. The Southern Hemisphere—which has its flu season during our summer—experienced an extremely mild one this year.﻿﻿ And that may be the case here, too. But with many of the previous restrictions now relaxed, a generally colder climate in most of the U.S., and a virus that’s ever-changing, there are no guarantees. Does a Mild Flu Season in Australia Mean a Milder Season for America? To be safe, healthcare workers are trying to convince as many people as possible to get vaccinated against the flu. (Believe it or not, less than half of American adults, on average, typically get the flu shot each year.) Cleveland Clinic, for instance, is now offering appointment-only vaccinations to accommodate for social distancing. Patients can also get vaccinated at most scheduled, in-person doctor's appointments. At The Johns Hopkins Health System, patients are screened to make sure they have had the flu vaccine. “We offer it to them if they haven’t yet been vaccinated,” a spokesperson tells Verywell. “And we offer the flu shot to patients at oncology curbside clinics at The Johns Hopkins Hospital.” The medical center is also engaging people through social media, as with a Facebook Live event. “Ensuring people get the influenza vaccine will go a long way to help prevent spread of influenza in the community, which will, in turn, prevent overtaxing the health systems,” Richard Rothman, MD, PhD, vice chair of research, department of emergency medicine, at The Johns Hopkins Hospital, tells Verywell. How to Safely Get a Flu Shot During the COVID-19 Pandemic Making a Faster Diagnosis COVID-19 and flu symptoms are nearly indistinguishable, marked by such symptoms as cough, muscle aches, fever. Some hospitals are administering combination-COVID-19-flu-virus tests, for which the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently issued an emergency use authorization; other hospitals plan to in the coming months. These tests are thought to conserve resources and time by providing results with one swab of the nose instead of two separate ones. At Mount Sinai Downtown in New York City, patients complaining of respiratory problems are isolated until the results for both flu and COVID-19 return, generally within 12 to 24 hours. "We want to identify the condition as early as possible to understand how best to treat the patient,” Erick Eiting, MD, vice chair of operations for emergency medicine at Mount Sinai Downtown, part of the Mount Sinai Health System in New York City, tells Verywell. Tests are assessed within the healthcare system, as opposed to being sent out to a third party lab, keeping the process quick and efficient. Keeping Patients and Healthcare Workers Safe Mask requirements, social distancing, and obsessive disinfecting are only the beginning. Beyond that, hospitals have instituted protocols to prevent the spread of COVID-19. “When anyone shows up, we isolate them until we know what we’re dealing with,” Alan Taege, MD, an infectious disease expert at Cleveland Clinic, tells Verywell. Isolation rooms have become increasingly important in hospitals. These negative-pressure rooms have a special ventilation system that sucks air up out of the room and through a filtration system. This prevents the escape of contaminated air. At Mount Sinai Downtown, there are now more than a dozen of these rooms, and the hospital is continuing to look at how they might expand the use of this technology to protect patients and staff. At Johns Hopkins Health System, hundreds of regular hospital rooms throughout its system had received a ventilation upgrade over the winter, spring, and summer with help from the building automation system and from HEPA filter fan units. This allows rooms to switch from positive air pressure (which keeps viruses out of the room) to negative air pressure (which prevents viruses from an infected COVID-19 patient from escaping into other rooms). Hospitals are also thinking more about helping patients feel more connected with family, even when they're kept apart. At UCLA Health, for instance, tablets in patient rooms allow loved ones to stay connected with the patient when they can’t come in. How Hospital Visitation Policies Are Changing During COVID-19 Making Room Back in April, UCLA Health erected tents so that patients with potential COVID-19 symptoms could be evaluated without potentially infecting others. In essence, says Dan Uslan, MD, UCLA Health’s co-chief infection prevention officer and clinical chief of the division of infectious diseases, “We’ve extended where we see our patients.” These strategies may again prove helpful should a large number of flu patients also require resources needed by COVID-19 patients. Securing Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) The major health systems we checked in with tell us they’re confident that their PPE stockpile (masks, face shields, and so on) will sustain the possible surge in patients needing care this winter. The nonprofit Get Us PPE confirms that an increasing number of requests are coming from non-hospital facilities, such as nursing homes and home health aid organizations. In fact, in April, 47% of requests were from acute care hospitals; now that number is 10%. “As the supply chain has caught up to some extent since April, hospitals are increasingly able to afford PPE, but small facilities still cannot,” Amanda Peery-Wolf, deputy director of communications at Get Us PPE, tells Verywell. “PPE distributors often don’t accept small orders, or the price per unit cost of a small order is cost-prohibitive, especially for facilities in under-resourced communities.” What This Means For You In this potentially complicated flu season, you may be tempted to forgo medical care and wait to address health concerns when the pandemic is over. Don't. It's still important to stay on top of your usual check-ups, treatments, and vaccines. Hospitals, especially larger ones, have made strides in adjusting their space and and their protocols—so you can stay safe and healthy, even in the midst of a pandemic.

That changed in July-August. As coronavirus (Covid-19) cases emerged, people began flocking to the memorial Right outside the expansive cemetery at Raia village in South Goa stood a stone structure covered in moss, overgrown weeds and creepers. It was scheduled to be demolished to make way for a wider road as part of highway expansion between Margao and Ponda, two towns in South Goa. A woman prays at the Spanish flu memorial in Goa’s Raia village.(HT photo) Little was known or spoken about the structure but its engraved inscription bore testimony to its true purpose. “E M (Em Memória) das vítimas de gripe de 1918” (In Memory of the Victims of the Flu of 1918) reads its plaque. Until earlier this year, the stone monolith that once had a cross at the top, which had collapsed due to lack of care, was given very little attention. That changed in July-August. As coronavirus (Covid-19) cases emerged in the village, people began flocking to the memorial, turning to it to pray for the survival of near and dear ones. On Sunday, October 11, work on restoration of the cross was completed and it was reconsecrated in a simple ceremony. Ever since, it has seen a steady stream of devotees and visitors who light candles and pray for the recovery of those ailing from Covid-19. “The Regidor (village administrator), Olivo Costa, and village elders got together to built this structure in memory of those who had died,” recalled Margarida Tavora e Costa whose lineage traces back to Olivo Costa. Legend has it that the village of Raia and the neighbouring village of Rachol, which is host to a Portuguese era fort and military garrison, were particularly affected by the Spanish flu of 1918 and as the bodies began filling the cemetery, the villagers had to expand the burial grounds in what would resemble a mass grave. The memorial was built atop the extended burial grounds to remember those who had perished. Locals say 318 people are believed to have died of Spanish flu in and around the village.

Even I didn’t know it existed,” Margarida said, adding that she was inspired to take the initiative to restore the memorial with help from her extended family. It is one of the two known memorials dedicated to victims of 1918 Spanish flu that still exist in Goa, the other one being in Salvador do Mundo. Stories surrounding the 1918 epidemic are mainly passed down through oral tradition. Anna Antonetta Fernandes, 88, recalled through her son, Marius Fernandes, the stories that she was told by her mother of the ‘gripe’ that afflicted the land leading to a piling up of bodies in her village that were carried up the hill away from human habitation and buried without any ceremony. In her book about health in colonial Goa, Fatima da Silva Gracias spoke of minimal effort by the government to contain the pandemic. “The first case of influenza in Goa was reported in 1917 in Bardez taluka (North Goa). It coincided with acute shortage of provisions. In Siolim (Bardez), eight to ten persons died daily. The outbreak did not attract any particular attention of the government as cases in the early period were not fatal. Able-bodied workers suffered the most on account of influenza. Pregnant mothers who suffered from influenza either died or miscarried or delivered premature babies,” Gracias said in her book. “The inhabitants of this territory in panic would run away at the mere sight of a dead body being carried away. The Government did not implement immediate measures to control or prevent the spread of the disease,” she wrote. Figures of how many succumbed to the flu across the colony are also hard to come by. The memorials are all that remains of the 1918 pandemic and today, they are relevant again. “I had a vision to restore what was done by our ancestors because of our family memory. During this time of the pandemic, we have to give back and we have to come together,” Margarida said. As to whether the memorial will still be demolished for the highway project, local MLA Aleixo Lourenço said, “There is no question of removing the Cross now, from where it stands. Whoever comes up with these ideas has an evil mind.” Stay updated with Mp...

By Aaron Mak Oct 13, 20201:06 PM Pence tried to cast Obama’s H1N1 response as a complete failure. Eva Claire Hambach/AFP via Getty Images Tweet Share Share Comment Tweet Share Share Comment When conversation at the the vice presidential debate on Wednesday turned to the coronavirus, Mike Pence pivoted from defense to offense by pillorying Joe Biden and Barack Obama’s response to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, also known as the swine flu. He depicted the previous administration’s swine flu response as lackluster and used that as proof that a president Biden would not be competent in shepherding the country through the COVID-19 pandemic. Here’s a clip of his remarks: Trump has long used H1N1 as a cudgel to counter the Biden campaign’s central argument that there’s a dire need for a new and more competent administration to take the reins of the U.S.’s coronavirus response. Even in March, when COVID-19 was first spreading widely, Trump falsely claimed that Obama “didn’t do anything” about swine flu. The president began reupping this line of attack after Pence brought up H1N1 in the debate, casting the 2009 pandemic as “one of the great disasters.” Advertisement Joe Biden has no plan for Coronavirus - ALL TALK! He was a disaster in his handling of H1N1 Swine Flu. He didn’t have a clue, with his own Chief of Staff so saying. If he were in charge, perhaps 2.2 million people would have died from this much more lethal disease!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 8, 2020 Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement But the Obama administration’s response to the swine flu wasn’t the calamity that Trump and Pence have made it seem. Advertisement During the debate, Pence noted that 60 million Americans contracted H1N1 and said, “If the swine flu had been as lethal as the coronavirus in 2009 when Joe Biden was vice president, we would’ve lost 2 million American lives.” The thing is that the federal government under Obama knew that swine flu was rarely lethal at the time and factored that fact into its decision-making in order to ensure that there wouldn’t be much disruption to the economy. (The mortality rate for H1N1 was 0.02 percent, while the mortality rate for COVID-19 is 0.65 percent.) It helped that H1N1 was an influenza, which doctors are very familiar with. Some medical experts actually criticized Obama for being too proactive about the swine flu given how mild it was. Conservatives went further to accuse him of overhyping the disease as a part of a cynical ploy to pass health care reforms. “Create panic and chaos, sell health care, keep general unrest out there amongst the population—it’s right out the Obama formula,” radio host Rush Limbaugh said in October 2009 in reaction to the then-president declaring a national emergency for the H1N1 pandemic. The eventual U.S. death toll—12,469 people—fell well below the 30,000 to 90,000 people that the President’s Council of Advisers on Science and Technology initially estimated might die. As infectious disease specialist Kent Sepkowitz wrote in Slate in March: Advertisement Advertisement We knew how to diagnose and treat H1N1, even if it was different than normal. Clinicians did not require much help outside of the ordinary—though we got it, maybe too much. In contrast, the current governmental response to COVID-19 is disorganized, disinterested, dishonest, and, worst of all, cruel to everyone in the country. Advertisement Trump has known how lethal the coronavirus is since at least early February. He told journalist Bob Woodward in a Feb. 7 interview that COVID-19 could be five times “more deadly” than the seasonal flu, even as he publicly downplayed the threat of the illness. So while the Obama administration was accused of being too alarmist about a not-very-lethal pandemic, the Trump administration has not been alarmist enough about a fairly lethal pandemic. Advertisement Popular in News & Politics There’s a Lot of Fighting Over Why Harris Lost. But Everyone Seems to Want to Avoid This Explanation. Democrats Are Forgetting What’s Actually Going to Happen When Trump Takes Office How Democrats Lost and Trump Won I Spent Years Watching J.D. Vance’s Rise. One Thing Is Clear About Him Now. One of the most damning statistics for the Trump administration’s coronavirus response, which moderator Susan Page referred to in Wednesday’s debate, is the number of fatalities in the U.S. compared with the rest of the world. The U.S. death toll as a percentage of our population is higher than that of almost any other wealthy nation. The U.S., which accounts for 4 percent of the world’s population, has been home to roughly 20 percent of the world’s reported coronavirus deaths. (There have been more than 210,000 coronavirus deaths in the U.S., while the global death toll recently surpassed 1 million.) Now let’s look at the swine flu. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that 12,469 people died from H1N1 in the U.S. The agency also estimated that somewhere between 151,700 and 575,400 people died from the illness worldwide. That’s a pretty big range, but even if we assumed that the lower end of that estimate is more accurate, then Americans only accounted for about 8 percent of the world’s swine flu deaths. If we take the higher end for granted, then Americans only accounted for 2 percent of the world death toll. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Did the Obama administration make mistakes with H1N1? Certainly. The U.S. may have been able to spot the virus earlier if it had better communication with Mexico, where the pandemic originated. The administration also overpromised when it came to vaccines, predicting in the summer of 2009 that it would have 160 million doses by the following October. When it ended up only delivering 30 million, the censure from Congress and the public was swift. Yet the administration’s errors didn’t result in the overwhelming loss of life we’re witnessing now. In fact, even Trump praised Obama’s handling of the swine flu at the time. In a 2009 Fox New interview, Trump said of the Obama administration’s measures, “It’s going to be handled. It’s going to come. It’s going to be bad. And maybe it will be worse than the normal flu seasons. And it’s going to go away. I think it is being handled fine. I think the words are right.” Tweet Share Share Comment 2020 Campaign Barack Obama Joe Biden Mike Pence Coronavirus Advertisement Advertisement About About Us Work With Us Contact Pitch Guidelines Send Us Tips Corrections Commenting Reprints Subscriptions Subscribe Sign In Account Subscription FAQs Podcast FAQs Newsletters Customer Support Advertising AdChoices Cookie Preferences The Slate Group logo Slate is published by The Slate Group, a Graham Holdings Company.

BBC's Laura Foster explains"That is why we are encouraging all pregnant women to have the vaccine as soon as possible, so they are protected from flu viruses circulating this winter."The RCM is also urging all midwives and maternity support workers to get vaccinated - to help protect the families they care for.How can I get a flu jab?Covid symptoms: Is it a cold, flu or coronavirus?Flu jab 'more important than ever' this winterBoth the World Health Organization and the NHS are worried about the 'double danger' of flu and coronavirus this winter.Scientific research shows getting both diseases at the same time can be serious and may be deadly.A significant flu season would put extra pressure on health services which already have to the manage the pressures caused by Covid-19 patients.To avoid that additional pressure, more people are being offered a free flu vaccine this year: anyone over 50 in England is eligible, although people over 65 with health conditions will be prioritised.The government says there is enough flu vaccine for 30 million people.Who will be offered the flu vaccine in England?people who were required to shield from coronavirus and anyone they share a home withpeople with some medical conditions, including diabetes, heart failure and asthmapregnant womenpre-school children over the age of twoall primary school children, as last year, and, for the first time, Year 7 pupilsinitially all people over 65, before the programme is extended to the over-50shealthcare and social care staffpeople living in a residential or nursing homepeople who are the main carer for an elderly or disabled personThe NHS will make contact with those who are eligible.Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales are also running flu campaigns.People who are not eligible for a free jab can pay for one at pharmacies and supermarkets, although availability is limited at present while stocks are prioritised for those who need it the most.

When October comes along and the weather begins to cool, many people think about pumpkin spice lattes and cozy sweater weather. But this month also means the start of cold and flu season—and a PSL’s nutrition profile won’t exactly help fend off infection. Since many of us have been wearing masks, social distancing, working from home, and practicing other strategies to minimize the spread of COVID-19, we may see less transmission of other respiratory infectious diseases, like the flu, according to a recent article published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.﻿﻿ But these practices are not a magic bullet to perfect health. Frequently, poor nutrient status is associated with inflammation and oxidative stress, which in turn can negatively impact the immune system.﻿﻿ Certain dietary choices may help support a healthy immune system to keep your body in fighting shape in case it does get infected by a common cold, the flu, or other illnesses. Along with proper hand washing, quality sleep, and other positive lifestyle choices, including these foods in your diet may help support your immune system during cold and flu season. Tips for Preventing Colds and the Flu Verywell / Zoe Hansen These Foods Can Help You Recover From the Flu Faster (and Some You Should Avoid) Legumes Legumes include chickpeas, dried peas, and lentils. Lisa Andrews, MEd, RD, LD, registered dietitian and owner of Sound Bites Nutrition in Cincinnati, Ohio, advises adding legumes or lentils to a diet for an immune system boost. She explains that these foods contain prebiotic fibers that help support live probiotics, specifically lactobacillus, to prevent infection and reduce inflammation. Fermented Foods Fermented foods contain live probiotics, and include kimchi, sauerkraut, and kefir. Probiotics are live bacteria that offer a health benefit to the host–and in this case, the host is you! Lindsey Pine, MS, RDN, a California-based registered dietitian and founder of Tasty Balance Nutrition recommends consuming fermented foods “because approximately 70% of our immune system resides in the gut. By keeping the gut healthy and including probiotic-containing foods, you're helping to protect the immune system.” Turmeric “Turmeric contains curcumin, which has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and protects your body from harmful compounds,” Alena Kharlamenko, MS,RS, a New York City-based registered dietitian, tells Verywell. If you're using turmeric, make sure to eat it with black pepper—it helps your body absorb it better. Turmeric May Be a Solution For Osteoarthritis Knee Pain, Study Finds Oysters Kharlamenko also recommends that people who want to support a healthy immune system add oysters into their diet. “Oysters and other shellfish like shrimp and lobster can also do wonders for your immune health,” she says. “They are packed with zinc, which helps protect your body from viruses and bacteria.” Salmon Salmon provides your body with important immune-supporting nutrients like vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids,﻿﻿ along with a health boost of protein, which is crucial for optimal antibody production.﻿﻿ Specifically, choosing Chilean-farmed salmon gives you more omega-3s compared to other types of fish, with no mercury or antibiotics. 100% Orange Juice With Added Vitamin D Orange juice is chock-full of immune-supporting nutrients, including vitamin C.﻿﻿ Choosing orange juice fortified with vitamin D gives some extra immune support, as adequate intake of this nutrient has been linked to reduced risk of respiratory tract infections, including the flu.﻿﻿ Two Glasses of OJ a Day Lowers Blood Pressure, Study Finds Garlic Adding crushed garlic to pasta sauces or including chopped garlic to salad dressings may help ward off illness during cold and flu season in a natural way. When garlic is crushed or chopped, a compound called allicin is produced. This compound has been shown to reduce inflammation and offer immune health benefits. A single trial suggested that garlic may prevent occurrences of the common cold, but more studies are needed to validate this finding.﻿﻿ What This Means For You Including any of these foods in your diet during cold and flu season may help support a healthy immune system in a natural way. 7 Sources Verywell Health uses only high-quality sources, including peer-reviewed studies, to support the facts within our articles.

Asda launches drive-through flu jab service Not just for groceries! Asda launches drive-through flu jab service October 16, 2020 News As reported by BBC news, supermarket Asda has launched a free NHS drive-through flu jab service for eligible people at 13 UK stores Anyone entitled to free jabs – such as the elderly, frontline NHS staff, and pregnant women – can use the service. People regarded as non-vulnerable can get jabs for £8, which Asda claims is the cheapest on the market. The drive-through jabs will be offered in Asda car parks, and come after reports people are put off visiting GPs and pharmacies due to COVID-19 worries. Asda says the initiative, which began on Thursday, is the first of its kind in the UK. But other retailers, including the Boots and Lloyds Pharmacy chemist chains, also offer jabs. The supermarket’s move comes amid news that flu jabs have been limited by pharmacists and health clinics due to high demand. However, NHS England says enough stocks are available. This year, up to 30 million people can be vaccinated in England, the government says. Maq Din, lead pharmacist at Asda Pharmacy, said: “The sad truth is that there is an increased mortality risk if you catch COVID-19 when you already have the flu. “We are putting a number of measures in place at our drive-through flu jab centres , so patients can be assured that it is safe to visit – and they won’t even need to leave their car to get a jab. Customers must pre-book, and will be given a time slot and a bay to park when turning up. Asda said its own research had shown that 28% of UK adults said they were currently putting off getting a flu jab over concerns about visiting GPs and pharmacies for fear of coming into contact with someone suffering from COVID-19. The booking procedure is: Find the nearest stores with a pharmacy using the store locatorTelephone the store for an appointment – it cannot be booked onlineDuring the consultation over the phone, people will be given a time slot and detail The service is available at these Asda stores: Accrington; Bodmin; Eastbourne; Gosport; Hartlepool; Hyde; Nuneaton; Old Kent Road (London); Oldbury; Pilsworth; Sheffield; South Shields; Wakefield Durkar.
