In this review, we provide our current understanding of the innate immune response that uses pattern recognition receptors to detect and respond to mRNA vaccination. We also provide an overview of mRNA vaccines, and discuss the future directions and challenges in advancing this promising therapeutic approach.IntroductionThe innate immune system serves as the first line of host immune response against pathogens but also virus-based vaccines containing either attenuated or inactivated viruses to prevent infectious diseases. After vaccination, the innate immune system identifies and removes vaccinated cells while coordinating the adaptive immune responses in the form of antigen-specific reactions, thereby sustaining long-term protection from the viral infection. To rapidly detect and defend against the various viruses, the immune cells have evolved to acquire multiple pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs), retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs), and the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor family proteins (NLRs) (1, 2). Through such receptors, the innate immune system is activated in a tightly regulated manner while retaining the adaptive immune response, but without excessive innate immune responses that can cause tissue damage and systemic inflammation, which are harmful to the host. In the present review, we discuss innate immune recognition, activation of inflammasome, and cytokine secretion in response to influenza virus infection and its mRNA vaccines. We also emphasize mRNA vaccines as promising tools for the prevention and control of influenza virus disease.Brief History on Influenza Vaccines to DateInfluenza viruses cause some of the most virulent respiratory tract infections in humans. Seasonal influenza virus epidemics are estimated to lead to up to 290,000–650,000 deaths per year globally (3). Influenza viruses are enveloped, negative-sense, single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses with a segmented genome. For instance, the influenza A virus (IAV) contains eight RNA segments encoding the RNA polymerase subunits [polymerase acidic protein (PA), polymerase basic protein 1 (PB1), polymerase basic protein 2 (PB2)], viral glycoproteins [hemagglutinin (HA), which facilitates viral entry; and neuraminidase (NA), which facilitates viral release], viral nucleoprotein (NP), matrix protein (M1), membrane protein (M2), and nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) (Figure 1A). IAV infects the cell through endosomal uptake and release, and the viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs) enter the nucleus for mRNA transcription and replication via a positive-sense complementary ribonucleoprotein (cRNP) intermediate. Viral mRNA is then converted into viral proteins in cytoplasm, which are complex into new virions and released from the cell (Figure 1B).FIGURE 1 Figure 1 Influenza A virus structure and replication. (A) The influenza A virus (IAV) genome comprises eight segmented, and single- and negative-stranded RNAs (vRNA). Each segment is encapsulated by a nucleoprotein (NP) and, mediated by the RNA polymerase, they form the viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complex (PB1, PB2, PA, and NP), which is the essential unit for both transcription and replication. (B) Infecting vRNP is transported into the nucleus where viral transcription and replication occurs, followed by progeny vRNP production. After the progeny vRNP is exported to the cytoplasm, the virus is assembled. HA, haemagglutinin; M1, matrix protein; M2, membrane protein; NA, neuraminidase; NS1, nonstructural protein 1; PA, polymerase acidic protein; PB1, polymerase basic protein 1; PB2, polymerase basic protein 2.There are four distinct types of seasonal influenza viruses: types A, B, C, and D. Types A and B influenza viruses are currently co-circulating in the human population and cause seasonal epidemics: the H1N1 and the H3N2 subtypes of IAVs, and two divergent lineages (Yamagata lineage and Vitoria lineage) of the influenza B viruses (IBVs) (4). Through the coordination of World Health Organization Global Influenza Surveillance Network, seasonal influenza virus vaccines are designed annually and the formulations contain the two IAV strains and two IBV strains; however, the efficacy of seasonal influenza virus vaccines varies greatly each influenza season (5). Upon seasonal influenza vaccine injection, innate immune cells, including macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) that are present in the muscle, cause an increase in the release of chemokines, which leads to the recruitment of more immune cells from the blood into the site of vaccination. The differentiated DCs act as antigen-presenting cells and migrate to the lymph nodes leading to the activation of T- and B-cells for the production of antibodies (6) (Figure 2). However, the vaccines induce narrow and strain-specific immunity that require constant updating (almost every year) due to the high frequency of point mutations, which ultimately represents a complex, expensive, and time-consuming process. In addition, various strains of influenza viruses, including avian and swine, have acquired the ability to grow efficiently in humans across species barriers from animal reservoirs and to disseminate between populations, posing a serious threat to humans. In addition to seasonal epidemics, influenza pandemics occur once every few decades and are caused by the swine-origin H1N1 IAVs, which have never circulated, and can spread rapidly across the human population. The H1N1 influenza virus pandemic in 1918 killed approximately 40 million people globally (7). Since then, pandemics have been caused by H2N2 in 1957, H3N2 in 1968, and again by H1N1pdm09 in 2009 (8). Considering seasonal influenza virus vaccines induce strain-specific immunity, which may not offer strong protection against infection by a pandemic-causing influenza virus, there is a need to develop novel influenza vaccines that induce broad immunity that is not focused on the corresponding vaccine strain (9).FIGURE 2 Figure 2 Host immune response against mRNA vaccines. A self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) vaccine can be delivered in the form of virus-like RNA particles, in vitro transcribed RNA, and plasmid DNA. Dendritic cells (DCs) recognize saRNA in the muscle and the cells are differentiated. The differentiated DCs function as antigen-presenting cells and migrate to the lymph nodes leading to activation of T- and B-cells for antibody production.Prior to the 1980s, inactivated and live-attenuated vaccines were established to protect humans against pathogenic microorganisms. Inactivated vaccines were manufactured by chemical or heat treatment, and live-attenuated vaccines were usually developed in animals or cell lines. The use of killed whole organism-based vaccines or live-attenuated vaccines had huge success in the reduction of viral infections including measles, mumps, rubella, and polio, and the eradication of smallpox infection (1). Despite the success, major concerns persist regarding conventional vaccination strategies. Infectious pathogens such as influenza virus are able to evade the adaptive immune response, and it is frequently difficult to develop live-attenuated or killed whole organism-based vaccines (10). In the case of the current influenza virus vaccine, the main challenge is its low effectiveness in the elderly (≥ 65 years old), who are more susceptible to influenza virus infection than children and adults (11). Such shortcomings of inactivated influenza virus vaccines are often attributed to mutations in surface antigens of the influenza virus. Other concerns regarding influenza virus live-attenuated vaccines include the potential to cause systemic inflammation and death, possibly due to back-mutations, acquisition of compensatory mutations, or recombination with circulating transmissible wild-type strains (12–14).Generally, influenza virus infects the host via the nasal or oral cavities, where it makes the first contact with the respiratory epithelium, similar to live-attenuated influenza vaccines administered intranasally (15, 16). After infecting the respiratory epithelial cells, the virus or the intranasal influenza vaccine can induce both systemic and mucosal immune responses. The defense mechanisms of the innate immune cells, especially DCs, are a formidable barrier to the influenza virus. Particular immune systems exist at distinct mucosal surfaces to fighting invasion by influenza virus. The viral RNA that is present within infected cells is recognized as non-self by various pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which leads to the release of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and type I interferons (IFNs). Macrophages, pneumocytes, DCs, and plasmacytoid-DCs produce type I IFNs, which in turn stimulate the expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) in neighboring cells that induce antiviral states (17–19).Unlike influenza virus infection or intranasal influenza vaccine, mRNA-based vaccines contain mRNAs that encode both the viral protein and immune-modulatory proteins as adjuvants, which enhance immunostimulatory properties. Upon mRNA entry into host cells, endosomal (e.g., TLR3, TLR7, and TLR8) and cytosolic innate immune sensors (e.g., RIG-I, PKR, NOD2, OAS, and MDA5) recognize mRNAs, including single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Subsequently, the immune cells are activated and produce type I IFN and multiple inflammatory cytokines (20). However, single-stranded mRNAs in the vaccine are purified appropriately through in vitro transcription process to eliminate the interaction with innate immune sensors, which induce excessive secretion of type I IFN and its cellular dysfunction (20).Furthermore, the adjuvant stimulates the innate immune response and drives antigen-specific T-cell responses without inducing systemic inflammation that could elicit severe side effects. In addition, injection site (e.g., subcutaneous, intramuscular, intradermal, and intravenous) and mRNA vaccine delivery formulations (e.g. lipid nanoparticle) influence the potency of the immune response (21). For instance, lipid nanoparticle carrier systems further protect mRNAs from nuclease, and can target delivery to lymphatics and promote protein translation in lymph nodes by intramuscular injection (20). In contrast to intranasal mRNA-mediated innate immune response, intramuscular mRNA will primarily be up taken by non-immune cells including local myocytes. Once in the lymph nodes, the lipid nanoparticle is eventually phagocytized by DCs, which consequently produce and present the antigen to T-cells to promote adaptive immune responses (22, 23). The capability of mRNA vaccines to induce the intracellular production of antigen proteins along with innate immune responses must prime both CD8+ and CD4+ T-cells to differentiate into effector and memory subsets for the protection from the infection (24).The effective use of in vitro transcribed mRNA in mammals was first reported in 1990, with reporter gene mRNAs being injected into mice that induced the production of the target proteins (25). A subsequent study showed that administration of vasopressin-encoding mRNA in the hypothalamus could induce a physiological response in rats (26). However, such early promising results did not lead to significant investment for the development of mRNA vaccines because of anxieties associated with mRNA instability, severe innate immune responses, and ineffective in vivo delivery. Over the past decade, however, major technological innovations and investments in research have made mRNA a promising vaccination tool. The use of mRNA vaccines has several benefits over subunit, killed, and live-attenuated viruses. As mRNA is a non-infectious and non-integrating platform, there is no potential risk of infection or insertional mutagenesis. In addition, mRNA is degraded by normal cellular processes, and various modifications and delivery methods can modulate its half-life in vivo (27–29). Formulating mRNA into carrier molecules facilitates rapid uptake and expression in the cytoplasm, where it is stable and highly translatable (28, 30). Furthermore, mRNA vaccines have quick, inexpensive, and mountable manufacturing potential due to the high yield of in vitro transcription responses. Additionally, several elegant studies with non-human primate models of influenza mRNA vaccine have been carried out. After immunization of modified non-replicating mRNA encoding influenza H10 encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles in monkeys, protective levels of antibodies against hemagglutinin were dramatically increased, similar to observations following seasonal influenza vaccination in humans (31). Using a novel imaging technology (positron emission tomography–computed tomography, PET–CT), an mRNA vaccine labeled with a probe is trafficked to assess bio-distribution in monkeys, providing insights of the mechanisms of the innate and adaptive immune responses following vaccine administration on site and at the draining lymph node, which translates into protective immunity (32).Innate Immunity to Influenza VirusesThe IAV is recognized as foreign by PRRs including TLRs, RLRs, and NLRs, which leads to programmed cell death, secretion of type I IFNs, and proinflammatory cytokines, which induce excessive inflammation.TLR- and RLR-Associated Influenza Virus RecognitionTLR- and RLR-mediated signals for influenza viruses induce to the release of type I IFNs and stimulate the expression of ISGs by infected and nearby cells to induce an antiviral state (33–36). Moreover, TLR and RLR signals also induce the release of proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 (37, 38).TLR3 senses dsRNA in endosomes. Although the cells infected by influenza virus do not produce dsRNA, Tlr3−/− mice have a longer lifespan compared with wild-type mice after deadly influenza virus infection (38), suggesting that TLR3 recognizes an unidentified RNA structure following viral infection. Furthermore, Tlr3−/− mice produce normal antibodies, and CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses after influenza virus infection (33), suggesting that TLR3 is dispensable for generating T-cell immunity. In plasmacytoid-DCs, TLR7 recognizes the ssRNA genomes of influenza virus (34, 35). TLR7 signaling via adaptor myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MYD88) leads to the activation of transcription factors including nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and IFN-regulatory factor 7 (IRF7), which induce the production of type I IFNs and proinflammatory cytokines (39–41).RIG-I is a cytosolic PRR that generally recognizes 5’ppp-double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). RIG-I also senses the 5’ppp-viral ssRNA that is produced following influenza viral replication (42–44). After detection of influenza viral RNA, the helicase domain of RIG-I interacts to ATP, which facilitates conformational changes of the caspase-recruitment domains (CARD) to interact with signaling adaptor mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) for type I IFN production (45, 46).Inflammasome-Mediated Response to Influenza VirusNLRs have an important role in antiviral immune response, inflammatory response, and cytokine induction. Proinflammatory signaling induces the recruitment of immune cell, such as macrophages and neutrophils, to eliminate pathogens and pathogen-derived molecules. IL-1β and IL-18 are key proinflammatory cytokines and are important for the protection against IAV infection (16, 47–49). Secretion of IL-1β and IL-18 requires the proteolytic maturation of pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18, respectively, that is mediated by inflammasomes. Inflammasomes are multiprotein complexes consisting of caspase-1, ASC, and PRRs, such as NOD–like receptor family protein 3 (NLRP3) (16, 47–49). Upon viral ligand sensing, PRRs induce self-oligomerization and binds to the inflammasome adaptor protein ASC, which is composed of an N-terminal pyrin domain (PYD) and a C-terminal CARD. ASC oligomerizes via homotypic interactions of the PYD domain and then binds to caspase-1 via the CARD for the inflammasome formation, which ultimately induces inflammatory cell death.In macrophages, influenza virus-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation requires the Z-DNA binding protein 1 (ZBP1) to form the ZBP1–NLRP3 inflammasome (50, 51). When replicating, IAV generates Z-RNAs, which are transformed versions of an RNA double helix, that are sensed by ZBP1 and bind to the receptor interacting serinehreonine kinase 3 (RIPK3) and caspase-8 to activate the ZBP1–NLRP3 inflammasome (50–52). Recently, it has been shown that caspase-6 facilitates RHIM-dependent binding of RIPK3 with ZBP1, promoting ZBP1-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome activation (53). In respiratory epithelial cells, MxA functions as an inflammasome sensor that recognizes influenza viral protein NP and induces the release of IL-1β and IL-18 in an NLRP3-independent manner (15, 16).NLRP3 and MxA inflammasome activation has been shown to be an important innate immune defense against influenza virus. After influenza virus strain A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8) infection, NLRP3 was found to be important for the migration of leukocytes into the lungs and to protect the host from infection (47, 49). During influenza virus infection in human MxA transgenic mice, rapid activation of the MxA inflammasome in the respiratory epithelium showed to suppress viral spreading from the bronchioles to the distal alveolar regions (16). The results of such studies suggest that optimal inflammasome activation is beneficial for the host; however, abnormal activation can cause to harmful outcomes.Adaptive Immunity to Influenza VirusInnate and adaptive immune responses significantly protects the host from influenza viruses and are important for the production of strong antibody responses. After influenza virus infection, the innate immune system is critical for recognizing and removing vaccinated cells while also coordinating an adaptive immunity through an antigen-specific antibody reaction and providing long-term protection from the viral infection.Upon recognition of viral antigens and interaction with cognate CD4+ T-cells, naïve B-cells are activated (54). Some of the activated B-cells quickly differentiate into short-lived plasmablasts. Although other activated B-cells migrate to the follicles of secondary lymphoid tissues and undergo a germinal center reaction, the plasmablasts produce the first wave of virus-specific antibodies in humans. If plasmablasts are derived from memory B-cells, the numbers of plasmablasts peak in the periphery at about 7 days post-infection (55). A small number of activated B-cells, however, will only differentiate into long-lived plasma cells, which migrate and resides in the bone marrow to produce antibodies, which provide the long-term serum antibody level and are associated with the defense against pathogen infection and disease. Another portion of the primarily activated B-cells differentiate into memory B-cells (56, 57), which do not release antibodies and remain in the periphery for immune surveillance, but they are long-lived and can be reactivated to become plasmablasts during infection for the production of new antibodies and further memory B-cells (55). Overall, the adaptive immunity-derived antibody response to influenza virus infection is relatively broad and long-lived; however, influenza viruses can deviate from the adaptive immune responses over time owing to their high mutation rates and antigenic flexibility. Further studies of how natural viral infection induces long-lived immune responses are required for the development of next-generation influenza virus vaccines.Conventional Seasonal Influenza Virus VaccinesSeasonal influenza virus vaccines are produced using egg-, cell-, and protein-based technologies, and the entire processes typically take 6~8 months. Influenza vaccines against IAVs and IBVs were invented in the 1940s and such whole-virus inactivated vaccines were generated in embryonated chicken eggs that consisted of crudely purified whole virus inactivated with formalin and phenylmercuric nitrate (58, 59). In 2012, vaccine-containing cell-based virus emerged as an alternative method for producing inactivated and live-attenuated vaccines (60). The efficacy of trivalent inactivated and live-attenuated influenza vaccines is approximately 65% and 83% in adults and children, respectively (61). Live-attenuated influenza virus vaccines that are used are usually cold-adapted and temperature-sensitive, and efficiently replicate in the upper but not the lower respiratory tract (62–64). Collectively, such studies indicate that seasonal influenza virus vaccines present good protection against influenza virus infection.However, there are also negative reports on such vaccines. A vaccine efficacy of 75% in adults declines suddenly in the elderly, who are more susceptible to influenza virus infection (65, 66). In addition, mismatches between vaccine and circulating strains sometimes occur and are generally associated to lower vaccine efficiency (67). Based on US virologic surveillance and US Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness (Flu VE) Network data, the estimated vaccine effectiveness (VE) against IAV or IBV decreased to 29% in all ages during the 2019–2020 influenza season (average VE in 2010–2018 was 44.1%) due to the spread of antigenically drifted IAV (H3N2), which has raised concerns about vaccine strain selection (68) (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccines-work/past-seasons-estimates.html). Furthermore, the duration of protection is occasionally short (69, 70). To induce stronger, more sustained immune responses in the elderly, high-dose vaccines or advanced adjuvant vaccines including MF59 and AS03, have been tested. The doses in high-dose vaccines are 4-fold those in trivalent inactivated vaccines, which could induce higher amounts of antibodies than standard dose vaccines (71). MF59-adjuvanted seasonal vaccines have been licensed and marketed in more than 25 countries for the elderly population (72, 73). AS03-adjuvanted influenza virus vaccines are also under consideration for use in the elderly population (74).Conventional Pandemic Influenza Virus VaccinesIAVs are typically transmitted within one animal species but sometimes they can cross over and cause illness in another species. In the latter situation, more significant genetic changes are exhibited than in circulating human seasonal IAV. If the novel IAV is infectious and spreads easily in humans, it is considered an influenza virus pandemic. Because most of the human population has no or only limited natural immunity to novel influenza virus strains, pandemic IAV vaccine candidates have been developed using a range of production platforms. The inactivated split influenza virus vaccine platform with an adjuvant has advanced the furthest, and other platforms, including nucleic acid (DNA and mRNA), vector, recombinant protein (VLP; virus-like particle), and live virus are still under development (75). H5N1 avian influenza virus vaccine was the first U.S. FDA-approved vaccine for the human population because concerns were raised with regard to the potential of the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus to cause an influenza pandemic (76, 77).One of the challenges in influenza pandemic management is the global vaccine production capacity within several months following the emergence of an outbreak. In the case of vaccines against H5N1 strains, the seed strains were generated using reverse genetics to remove the multi-basic cleavage site of the HA and to alter the backbone to that of a high-growth PR8 H1N1 strain, which exhibits relatively less pathogenicity (77). Such modifications facilitate the production of safer vaccine strains and at high quantities, because highly pathogenic IAVs frequently kill embryonated eggs, resulting in low production (77). A number of the H5N1 and H7N9 vaccines have been tested in humans and a high antigen dose or the use of an adjuvant is necessary to induce reliable hemagglutination inhibition titer (77, 78). A clinical trial of an H7N9 vaccine yielded an efficacy of approximately 60% despite the use of an adjuvant (79), indicating that adjuvants and multiple vaccinations are required for achieving sufficient vaccine efficiency.Messenger RNA Vaccine Strategies Against Influenza VirusmRNA vaccines are extensively characterized by experimental approaches that improve mRNA stability and delivery, and protein production. Such approaches involves the development of nanoparticle transport techniques that stabilize mRNA, enhance cellular uptake, and improve biological availability when mRNA enters the cell. A clear advantage of mRNA vaccines is that it does not need to enter the nucleus to promote antigen expression.Self-Amplifying mRNA Vaccines Against Influenza VirusA self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) vaccine can be carried in the form of plasmid DNA, virus-like RNA particles, and in vitro transcribed RNA (80) (Figure 3). DNA plasmid-based saRNA vaccines combine the advantages of a more stable DNA nucleic acid product with greater levels of antigen expression. saRNA vaccines have elicited strong immune responses in preclinical models (81). saRNA vaccines are derived from the genome backbone of an alphavirus, in which the genes encoding the viral RNA replication machinery are intact (82).FIGURE 3 Figure 3 Obtaining antigen expression by self-amplifying RNA vaccination. Three routes for the delivery of self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) are shown. These include: 1) virus-like RNA particles that deliver saRNA to the cytoplasm by receptor-mediated endocytosis, 2) direct delivery of in vitro transcribed replicon saRNA to cells either in saline or in synthetic formulations, and 3) plasmid DNA carrying replicase genes and the transgene into the nucleus, where it is transcribed, generating replicon saRNA, which is then transported to the cytoplasm. The three saRNA vaccination routes finally generate messenger RNA (mRNA), which is translated via ribosomes to produce vaccine antigen.There are several reports on the use of saRNA vaccines against influenza virus. Immunization with 10 mg of saRNA vaccine encoding PR8 H1N1 IAV HA produced antibody responses and protection from lethal homologous viral challenge in mice (83). Another study showed development of saRNA vaccines where the A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) or A/Shanghai/2/2013 (H7N9) IAV HA-encoding saRNA was formulated in lipid nanoparticles, and small doses induced protective levels of hemagglutination inhibition titers after two intramuscular injections in mice (84). Consistent with this finding, another group showed that intramuscular administration of 0.1 or 0.2 mg of PR8 H1N1 IAV NP, M1, or combined NP+M1 self-amplifying RNA-lipid nanoparticle vaccines resulted in strong antigen-specific T-cell responses and protection from homologous viral infection (85). IAV HA and NP replicon RNA complexed with chitosan-containing lipid nanoparticles or polyethylenimine (PEI) has elicited T- and B-cell immune responses in mice after subcutaneous delivery (86, 87). A recent study revealed a delivery platform consisting of a chemically modified, ionizable dendrimer complexed into lipid nanoparticles. Using this platform, intramuscular delivery of RNA replicons encoding A/WSN/33 (H1N1) IAV HA successfully protected mice against lethal homologous virus challenge (88). A more recent study showed a direct comparison of the immune response and protective efficacy after self-replicating mRNA and non-replicating mRNA immunization in mice (80). Animals were intramuscularly immunized two times with increasing doses of PR8 H1N1 IAV HA-encoding unformulated self-replicating mRNA or unmodified non-replicating mRNA and challenged eight weeks after the first vaccination. Both platforms induced protection against infection with the homologous influenza virus (80).Non-Replicating Influenza Virus mRNA VaccinesNon-replicating mRNA vaccines can be made with the incorporation of various modified nucleosides, and much effort has been invested in the development of directly injectable non-replicating mRNA vaccines. There are several studies of non-replicating mRNA vaccines against influenza virus. Administration of IAV NP-encoding mRNA complexed in liposomes induced cytotoxic T-cell responses in mice (89). Intradermally immunized mice, ferrets, and pigs with various IAV HA-, NP-, and NA-encoding RNActive vaccines produced protective immune responses after a single immunization (90). Intravenous immunizations in mice using PR8 H1N1 IAV HA-encoding unmodified mRNA-lipid complexes showed elevation of T-cell activation after administration of a single dose (91). Together, it will be important to determine if and how these findings translate to clinical trials and vaccination.Innate Immunity to mRNA VaccinesThe innate immune system acts as the first line of host immune response against mRNA vaccination. During an mRNA vaccination, the mRNA can be recognized by various PRRs, including TLRs, RLRs, and NLRs, for the production of IFNs and proinflammatory cytokines. Prototypically, IFNs and proinflammatory cytokines are largely beneficial to the host and trigger induction of IFN-inducible genes and the infiltration of immune cells to remove vaccinated cells. However, dysregulated IFNs and proinflammatory cytokines drive inhibition of efficacy of mRNA vaccines, detrimental systemic hyperinflammation, and tissue damage. Therefore, appropriate purification of in vitro transcribed mRNA is critical for maximizing immunogen production and avoiding undesired innate immune activation.TLR3 senses dsRNA longer than 45 base pairs and those derived from ssRNA forming secondary structures or from viral replication intermediates. TLR7 can recognize both dsRNA and ssRNA, whereas TLR8 only senses ssRNA (92). The activation of TLR7 can stimulate antigen presentation, cytokine release, and induce B-cell responses (93). In particular, RIG-I senses ssRNA and dsRNA bearing a 5′-triphosphate and stimulates IFN production (44, 94).mRNA vaccine-derived IFN production via RNA sensors is dependent on the quality of in vitro transcribed mRNA, the delivery vehicle, and the administration route. Recognition of in vitro transcribed mRNA contaminated with dsRNA cause rapid type I IFN induction, which upregulates the expression and activation of protein kinase R (PKR) and 2′-5′-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS). This leads to the inhibition of translation and the degradation of cellular mRNA, ribosomal RNA, and in vitro transcribed mRNA (95–97) (Figure 4). Contaminating dsRNA can be efficiently removed from in vitro transcribed mRNA by chromatographic methods including reverse-phase fast protein liquid chromatography or high-performance liquid chromatography. Purification by these methods has been shown to increase antigen protein production from in vitro transcribed mRNA by up to about 1000-fold in human DCs (97). In addition to dsRNA contaminants, single-stranded mRNA molecules are recognized as a PAMP and detected by TLR7 and TLR8, resulting in type I IFN production and decreased antigen protein production from in vitro transcribed mRNA (98–100).FIGURE 4 Figure 4 Dysregulated innate immunity prevents mRNA vaccine efficacy Upon mRNA vaccination, incoming self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) is recognized by the Toll-like receptor (TLR) 3, TLR7, and retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), which promotes their downstream signaling and consequent production of type I interferon (IFN). Recognition of in vitro transcribed mRNA contaminated with dsRNA causes rapid type I IFN production, which induces the expression and activation of protein kinase R (PKR) and 2′-5′-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS). This will inhibit the translation and induce the degradation of cellular mRNA, ribosomal RNA, and in vitro transcribed mRNA. EIF2a, eukaryotic initiation factor 2a; IFNAR, interferon-alpha receptor.Given that reducing type I IFN signaling is critical for mRNA vaccine strategy, several studies revealed the development of modified mRNA that reduced type I IFN signaling. Incorporation of naturally occurring chemically modified nucleosides, including pseudouridine and 1-methylpseudouridine, prevented the activation of TLR7, TLR8, and other innate immune sensors, thereby reducing type I IFN signaling (27, 101–104). Another study also showed that nucleoside-modified mRNA translated better compared with that of unmodified mRNA in vitro, especially in primary DCs, and in vivo in mice (27, 103). Together, the balance between mRNA vaccines and the innate immune response is critical for potential vaccine approaches; this balance must be finely controlled to reduce excessive innate immune responses while retaining maximal immunogen production in DCs.Note, that while the inflammasome-dependent release of IL-1b and IL-18 triggers further production in DCs for the induction of influenza virus-specific CD8+ T-cell priming (49, 105), whether in vitro transcribed mRNA can be recognized by inflammasome sensors remains largely unknown. Future studies are needed to fully examine the factors required for the inflammasome-driven adaptive immune response.mRNA-Based Influenza Virus Vaccine DevelopmentmRNA vaccines have lately attracted substantial attention, involved massive academic and industrial investment, and biotechnology companies have succeeded in raising capital for the development of innovative RNA vaccines. The first directly injectable influenza RNA vaccine against H10N8 and H7N9 was developed by scientists at Moderna Therapeutics (USA), who demonstrated that it was possible to induce protective immunogenicity with acceptable tolerability profiles (106, 107). For the first human seasonal influenza virus RNA vaccine trial, CureVac AG company (Germany) developed a sequence-engineered mRNA-lipid nanoparticle strategy that enables an extraordinary level of in vivo protein translation without the use of modified nucleosides (29). Using this strategy, a recent study demonstrated that a single intramuscular immunization with 10 μg of A/Netherlands/602/2009 (H1N1) HA-encoding mRNA-lipid nanoparticles induce hemagglutination inhibition titers in the protective range (≥1:40) in non-human primates. Moreover, inoculation of a second dose effectively boosted immune responses and resulted in hemagglutination inhibition titers ≥1:160 for over 1 year in all vaccinated animals (108). CureVac AG scientists provided evidence that two immunizations with mRNA-lipid nanoparticles encoding for HA from A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 (H3N2) induced stronger T- and B-cell immune responses than the licensed MF59-adjuvanted trivalent inactivated IAV vaccine.Limitations of mRNA VaccinemRNA vaccine-associated hypersensitivity reactions are not often observed. Similarly, severe acute-onset, presumably immunoglobulin-E (IgE)- or immunoglobulin-G (IgG)-mediated, and complement-mediated anaphylactic or severe delayed-onset T-cell-mediated systemic responses are considered very rare. Hypersensitivity to the active antigen of the vaccine can also be developed. Acute hypersensitivity responses following vaccination include self-limited local side effects and systemic responses can range from urticaria/angioedema to full-scale anaphylaxis with multisystem involvement (109).Anaphylaxis is a rare life-threatening allergic reaction that usually occurs within minutes to hours after vaccination (109). Anaphylaxis induced by vaccines is generally rare. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic highlighted the need for robust vaccine production via mRNA vaccines derived in lipid nanoparticles. Unexpectedly, there are fewer serious allergic reactions due to public vaccines and, as a result, there are considerable public concerns centered on atopic individuals. Previous research on the immune mechanism of vaccine-related anaphylaxis has focused on the presence of gelatin, latex, and egg proteins, and more recently on polysorbate 80, a widely used surfactant present in many vaccines (110). However, all of the above-mentioned excipients were not included in the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine and no cases of anaphylaxis were observed in large-scale phase 2/3 clinical trials; thus, these events are unexpected (111, 112). Hence, occurrence of anaphylaxis upon initial exposure to the COVID-19 vaccine refers to pre-existing antibody-mediated immunity (allergy) or a pseudo-allergic reaction unrelated to previous exposure.Anaphylaxis associated with known allergens is best understood through the classical paradigm of crosslinked IgE bound to fragment crystallizable region (Fc) ϵ receptors of mast cells and basophils, but nonclassical pathways including antibody-dependent activation of complement or IgG-associated mast cell/granulocyte/platelet/basophil-mediated mast cell/granulocyte/platelet/basophil activation via Fcγ receptors has been described in animal models and in human allergic responses to drugs (113–117). Unfortunately, information on the potential use of vaccines for testing to confirm the pathological etiology or predict reactivity risk remain scarce.A rapid and thorough study-based evaluation of patients who have experienced anaphylactic vaccine reactions and prospective clinical trials in individuals at risk are requested to address these concerns during the public health crisis.Conclusions and Future Research DirectionsWe have highlighted the innate immune system response during IAV mRNA vaccination. Optimal innate immune sensing and inflammatory cytokine release are essential for T- and B-cell immune responses. However, excessive host innate immune responses possibly lead to cytokine storms and/or tissue damage (118, 119), inhibiting the efficacy of influenza virus mRNA vaccines. Therefore, mRNA-induced innate immunity must be controlled to reduce excessive inflammation while retaining antibody production.Over the past decade, there has been a clear breakthrough in the field of influenza virus mRNA vaccines, demonstrating proof-of-concept in both preclinical and clinical settings (20). However, reducing the innate immune sensing of mRNA and maximizing translatability of the promising animal data to humans remains challenging. Further clinical trials examining the long-term safety and immunogenicity are required to evaluate the impact of RNA vaccines on the influenza virus vaccine field.Currently, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread globally, urgently requiring effective vaccines to fight it. FDA-approved mRNA vaccines are greatly effective in working-age adults at preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection, with the vaccines attenuating the viral RNA load, risk of febrile symptoms, and duration of illness among those who have breakthrough infection despite vaccination (120). The future of mRNA vaccine field is potential, and the clinical data and resources provided by the associated companies and other academic institutions are likely to significantly build on and strengthen basic research into mRNA-based vaccines.Author ContributionsSL and J-HR conceived the outline of the manuscript.

In order to confirm the efficacy of a 3-day regimen, we started to conduct a prospective, multi-center, single-arm trial.MethodsThis study is a prospective, multi-center, single-arm study designed by the Sectional Meeting of Clinical Study, Japan Infection Prevention and Control Conference for National and Public University Hospitals. Index patients with influenza are prescribed a neuraminidase inhibitor and are discharged immediately or transferred to isolation rooms. The close contacts are given oseltamivir as 75 mg capsules once daily for adults or 2 mg/kg (maximum of 75 mg) once daily for children for 3 days as PEP. All close contacts are monitored for development of influenza for 7 days after starting PEP.DiscussionA 3-day regimen of oseltamivir as PEP has advantages over 7- to 10-day regimens in terms of costs, medication adherence and adverse effects.Trial registration The Institutional Review Board of Hokkaido University Hospital for Clinical Research, 015-0518, registered on November 11, 2016.

Japan Registry of Clinical Trials, jRCTs011180015, disclosed on March 14, 2019. https://jrct.niph.go.jp/latest-detail/jRCTs011180015 Peer Review reports BackgroundPost-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) using oseltamivir has been shown to be effective for reducing secondary infection of influenza in hospital wards [1]. A retrospective observational study showed that a 3-day regimen of oseltamivir as PEP for preventing transmission of influenza in wards is comparable to 7- to 10-day regimens provided index cases are immediately separated from close contacts [2]. In order to confirm the efficacy of a 3-day regimen of oseltamivir as PEP, we started to conduct a prospective, multi-center, single-arm trial.Methods/designAimThe objective of this study is to investigate the efficacy of a 3-day regimen of oseltamivir for PEP of influenza in hospital wards.Study settingThis study is a prospective, multi-center, single-arm study designed by the Sectional Meeting of Clinical Study, Japan Infection Prevention and Control Conference for National and Public University Hospitals in Japan. This trial will involve patients from Hokkaido University Hospital, Kagoshima University Hospital, Shinshu University Hospital, Tokyo Medical and Dental University Hospital, Tohoku University Hospital, Kobe University Hospital, Chiba University Hospital, Osaka City University Hospital, Tottori University Hospital and Shimane University Hospital in Japan.EndpointsThe primary endpoint is the incidence of influenza for 7 days after starting PEP using oseltamivir by use of a 3-day regimen. The development of influenza is defined as development of influenza-like symptoms (e.g., fever, cough and runny nose) with a positive immunochromatographic test (ICT). The secondary endpoints are the associations of the incidence of influenza for 7 days after starting PEP using oseltamivir by use of a 3-day regimen with age, sex, influenza vaccination and underlying conditions of the patients because of the possibility of development of influenza in elderly patients, unvaccinated patients and immunocompromised patients even if they are prescribed oseltamivir.Study designThe index patients with influenza are prescribed a neuraminidase inhibitor and are isolated from close contacts [2]. Close contacts who fulfill all of the criteria described in “Eligibility and exclusion” are given oseltamivir [75 mg capsules once daily for adults or 2 mg/kg (maximum of 75 mg) once daily for children] for 3 days as PEP. Since PEP with anti-influenza agents is widely practiced in Japan for both healthcare workers and patients, even for those who have already received vaccination, it is difficult to conduct a randomized controlled trial with comparison of a 3-day regimen of oseltamivir and a placebo control. The results of previous studies are destined to be used as historical controls [1,2,3,4].Eligibility and exclusionEligible participants are (1) patients over 1 year of age, (2) patients sharing a room with index patients with influenza who are separated immediately (ex. by discharge or transferring to isolation rooms), (3) patients in whom administration of oseltamivir as PEP is started within 48 h after onset of fever of the index patients and (4) patients for whom written informed consent to participate in the study is obtained by the physicians participating in this study, from the patients themselves or from proxies. The following patients are not eligible for participation in this study: (1) patients with impairment of renal function (creatinine clearance ≤ 30 ml/min) and (2) patients between 10 and 19 years of age, because the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare issued a warning against the use of oseltamivir in teenagers, except for those at high risks, after reports of two suicides by teenagers shortly after ingestion of oseltamivir in March 2007 [5].Study intervention and timeline of the studyThe following information will be obtained from each patient’s record at the time of enrolment: (1) body temperature, respiratory symptoms (e.g., cough and runny nose) and results of an immunochromatographic test (ICT) of influenza in index patients, (2) clinical history including age, sex, body weight, influenza vaccination, past infection with influenza, underlying disease and medical history, and results of laboratory tests including hemoglobin, white blood count, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatinine for the close contacts. Eligible participants for whom administration of oseltamivir is started as PEP are monitored for influenza-like symptoms (fever and respiratory symptoms) for 7 days (Table 1). If the eligible patients have influenza-like symptoms with a positive immunochromatographic test (ICT), they are regarded as having developed influenza. Information on adverse events will be obtained regardless of their grade of severity. This trial was declared and registered on November 11, 2016 (see “Trial status”).Table 1 Schedule of data collectionFull size tableSample sizeIn our previous study [2], we prophylactically administered oseltamivir for 3 days to 212 patients, and only 2 (0.9%) of the patients developed influenza. In preceding clinical trials [1, 3, 4], the proportion of patients with influenza infection in the placebo group was about 7%. In this study, it is assumed that the proportion of patients with influenza will be lower than that in preceding studies due to the different study environments. Based on the idea of non-inferiority margin [6], the clinically meaningful margin is set to be 50% of pre-existing risk difference (δ = 7 − 1 = 6%). Therefore, the non-inferiority margin of our study is set to be 3%. From the above argument, we assumed that the proportions of patients with influenza infection are 1% in this study (3-day regimen) and 4% in the null reference. Since the incidence of influenza in a hospital is relatively low and it is possible to confirm the presence or absence of influenza in a short period of time, a binomial distribution was assumed for the incidence. Using the binominal exact test statistic, the expected sample size was calculated to be 253 for detection of a 3% risk difference to achieve a power of 80% at a one-sided significance level of 2.5%. Considering the dropout rate as 10%, the final sample size became 279.Statistical analysisFor primary outcome assessment, a binomial (exact) test is performed to test the risk difference of 3% (proportions of patients with influenza infection being 4% for the null reference and 1% for the proposed regimen) at the one-sided significance level of 2.5%. Descriptive statistics are calculated for the secondary outcomes. All analyses are performed using SAS Version 9.4 (Cary, NC: SAS Institute Inc).EthicsThe trial will be conducted under ICH E6 (R2) and Ethical Guidelines for Medical and Health Research Involving Human Subjects (Japan). The trial will adhere to the Clinical Trials Act (Japan) from April 1, 2019. Recruitment of participants can start following approval by the IRB of each hospital. The recruitment in Shinshu University Hospital and Kobe University Hospital will be discontinued from April 1, 2019 onward.Data quality assuranceThe investigators will be responsible for implementing and maintaining quality assurance and quality control systems in accordance with written standard operating procedures. Centralized monitoring will be implemented in accordance with the manual prepared prior to the beginning of the trial.Data securityConfidential patient information is kept secure by the rules of medical confidentiality and is treated according to the Act on the Protection of Personal Information in Japan.SafetyParticipants will be free to withdraw at any time from participation. An investigator may decide to terminate participation in the study if a participant meets an exclusion criterion (either newly developed or previously recognized) that precludes further participation.Adverse event (AE)An adverse event (AE) will be managed according to the FDA’s guidance [7]. All severe adverse event (SAE) information will be reported to the IRB and must be shared with all investigators participating in the study.DiscussionThe effectiveness of PEP using oseltamivir by use of 7 to 10-day regimens has been shown by several studies [1, 3, 4, 8]. In a previous retrospective observational study conducted from the 2005/06 to 2014/05 influenza seasons, a 3-day regimen of oseltamivir as PEP for preventing transmission of influenza in wards was shown to be comparable to 7- to 10-day regimens of oseltamivir provided index cases were immediately separated from close contacts [2]. A 3-day regimen of oseltamivir as PEP has advantages over 7- to 10-day regimens as regards costs, medication adherence and adverse effects [9].The incidence rate of influenza within a hospital and the expected incidence rate for the proposed regimen are both low; thus, for the detection of a small difference, the required sample size would become large to achieve nominal statistical power. In order to confirm the efficacy of a 3-day regimen of oseltamivir for PEP of influenza in wards, we started to conduct a prospective, multi-center, single-arm trial of a 3-day regimen of oseltamivir for PEP.Trial statusThis trial was declared and registered on November 11, 2016. Recruitment into the trial started on November 11, 2016 and will end in March 2024 or until a total of 279 participants have been recruited. Between November 2016 and May 2020, 68 patients were enrolled. Among them, 3 patients developed influenza after starting PEP using oseltamivir by use of a 3-day regimen.

Back to Healio Influenza vaccination early after MI or in high-risk CAD was associated with a 28% lower risk for all-cause death, MI or stent thrombosis at 12 months compared with placebo, according to results of the IAMI trial. Perspective from Erin D. Michos, MD, MHS, FACC, FAHA, FASE, FASPC “One of the messages from this study is if you incorporate influenza vaccination as part of routine care after MI — at least during the influenza season — you will ensure high compliance and you will ensure an effect,” Ole Fröbert, MD, PhD, adjunct professor and consultant cardiologist at Orebro University Hospital in Sweden, said during a press conference at the European Society of Cardiology Congress. Source: Adobe Stock The randomized, double-blind IAMI trial enrolled 2,571 adults from 30 centers across eight countries, and was conducted during four flu seasons between October 2016 and February 2020. The average age of participants was 60 years and 18% were women; none received a flu vaccine prior to enrollment. Participants received inactivated influenza vaccine or saline placebo in a 1:1 ratio, administered shortly after MI (99.7% of patients) or hospitalization for high-risk stable CAD (0.3%). “Target enrollment was 4,400 patients, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the data safety monitoring board recommended termination of the trial after 2,571 patients were enrolled in April 2020,” Fröbert said. During follow-up, the primary outcome, a composite of all-cause death, MI or stent thrombosis at 12 months, occurred in 5.3% those assigned flu vaccine and 7.2% of those assigned placebo (HR = 0.72; 95% CI, 0.52-0.99; P = .04). In assessing the individual key secondary endpoints, the rate of all-cause death among participants in the flu vaccine group compared with placebo was 41% lower in the flu vaccine group (2.9% vs. 4.9%; HR = 0.59; 95% CI, 0.39-0.89; P = .01), as was the rate of CV death (2.7% vs. 4.5%; HR = 0.59; 95% CI, 0.39-0.9; P = .014). MI incidence did not differ between groups (HR = 0.86; 95% CI, 0.5-1.46; P = .57). “Our findings suggest that influenza vaccination saves lives and should be considered part of in-hospital treatment after MI,” Fröbert said. “Patients with CVD should get their annual flu shot. Influenza illness is associated with CVD and a flu shot could prevent CV death and, of course, influenza.” Fröbert noted that it is unclear how the findings would translate to vaccine administration during non-flu seasons; however, registry studies from smaller trials suggest there could be an extended, pleiotropic effect that extends throughout the year. “The HR, despite the fact that we did not enroll the anticipated number of participants, was more or less exactly where it was prespecified in our calculations,” Fröbert said. “The effect size was also the same as seen in small, single-center randomized trials and the same effect size as seen in meta-analyses, including observational data.” Reference: Fröbert O, et al. Circulation. 2021; doi:10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.121.057042. Perspective Back to Top Erin D. Michos, MD, MHS, FACC, FAHA, FASE, FASPC This is an important study. How many other interventions decrease CV death by 41%? Our previous meta-analysis, which is cited in the paper, included 240,000 patients, though mostly observational study data, suggesting patients with CVD benefitted from the flu vaccine with a 25% reduction in all-cause mortality and an 18% reduction in CV mortality. Because our data was mostly observational, we were awaiting these new data. The most impactful evidence comes from well-done randomized controlled trials like this one. Not only is this a randomized controlled trial, but here these patients received their influenza vaccines while in the hospital or within 72 hours of their MI. This was not just patients with CVD, but those at highest risk with very recent acute coronary syndromes. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the researchers did not meet their target sample size. Despite an early stop, this study still shows a remarkable 28% reduction in the primary outcome of major adverse CV events, a 41% reduction in CV death and a 41% reduction in all-cause death. This emphasizes the importance of vaccination and shows this strategy works for CV prevention. This should be part of post-MI care. Erin D.

The researchers found that during influenza epidemics more people die due to cardiovascular causes compared with non-epidemic periods. And while influenza vaccination is recommended for patients with heart disease, it is not part of standard hospital care for patients who have had an MI. “Our findings suggest that influenza vaccination should be considered as part of in-hospital treatment after myocardial infarction,” Ole Fröbert, MD, of Örebro University, Sweden, said in a press release. As part of the IAMI trial—the largest trial designed to evaluate whether influenza vaccination improves outcomes following MI or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in high-risk patients with coronary artery disease (CAD)—researchers analyzed patients at 30 hospitals in eight countries over four influenza seasons from October 2016 through February 2020.In the analysis, 6,696 patients were screened, of which 2,571 were randomized and 2,532 received the influenza vaccination or placebo and were included in a modified intention-to-treat analysis.Eighteen percent of the patients were women, and the mean patient age was 60 years old. The study cohort received either the influenza vaccine or placebo within 72 hours of an invasive coronary procedure or hospitalization. According to the authors the primary endpoint was a composite of all-cause death, MI, or stent thrombosis at 12 months. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the trial was halted prematurely on April 7, 2020, by the data safety and monitoring board after 2,571 patients, (58% of the target) were enrolled.The primary composite endpoint occurred in 67 patients in the vaccine group and 91 in the placebo group. Concerning secondary endpoints, death from any cause occurred in 37 patients in the vaccine group and 61 in the placebo group. Rates of cardiovascular death were 2.7% and 4.5%, respectively. There was no difference reported between groups in the rate of MI, which occurred in 2% and 2.4% of patients in the vaccine and placebo groups, respectively. According to the authors, serious adverse events were infrequent and of similar type and incidence in the vaccinated and placebo groups. Whereas injection site reactions such as pain, redness, swelling, and hardening were reported considerably more often in patients assigned to influenza vaccine.In an interview conducted at ECS 2021, Fröbert said he hoped that the COVID-19 vaccination would make people more aware of the importance of vaccination in general. “Perhaps some who have received the COVID vaccine will now understand how important also other vaccines are, that’s really an important issue.”See the full study here.Anthony VecchioneRelated ContentPredicting sudden cardiac death after a heart attack may be impossible—for nowPayment cuts and beyond: Key takeaways for cardiologists from the 2025 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule‘A huge win’: CMS significantly increases Medicare payments for cardiac CTFDA clears AI tool that flags signs of heart disease in chest CT scansColchicine falls flat in large heart attack trial, convincing cardiologists to stay awayNew data highlight long-term benefits of HeartFlow’s AI-based CAD evaluationsAround the webHealth Imaging Use of AI opportunistic screening in CT for cardiovascular disease Ron Blankstein, MD, professor of radiology, Harvard Medical School, explains the use of artificial intelligence to detect heart disease in non-cardiac CT exams.Health Imaging New imaging protocols proposed to curb rise of cardiovascular infectionsEleven medical societies have signed on to a consensus statement aimed at standardizing imaging for suspected cardiovascular infections.Radiology Business What does radiology have to do with climate change?Kate Hanneman, MD, explains why many vendors and hospitals want to lower radiology's impact on the environment.

The viral spike S glycoprotein binds to the human receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and then is activated by the host proteases. Based on the accessibility of the cellular proteases needed for SARS-S activation, SARS-CoV-2 entrance and activation can be mediated by endosomal (such as cathepsin L) and non-endosomal pathways. Evidence indicates that in the non-endosomal pathway, the viral S protein is cleaved by the furin enzyme in infected host cells. To help the virus enter efficiently, the S protein is further activated by the serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), provided that the S has been cleaved by furin previously. In this review, important roles for host proteases within host cells will be outlined in SARS-CoV-2 infection and antiviral therapeutic strategies will be highlighted. Although there are at least five highly effective vaccines at this time, the appearance of the new viral mutations demands the development of therapeutic agents. Targeted inhibition of host proteases can be used as a therapeutic approach for viral infection.Highlights• Furin and TMPRSS2 mediate SARS-corona virus infection, SARS-CoV-2, and influenza entry into the human cells.• As a causative factor, TMPRSS2 exerts more severe outcomes for COVID-19.• Targeted inhibition of TMPRSS2 and furin may be used as a therapeutic approach for COVID-19.• Bromhexine hydrochloride may be an effective therapeutic drug for COVID-19.IntroductionOver the last 2 decades, several outbreaks of coronaviruses (CoVs) have received worldwide attention since they were responsible for the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus) in China (2002–2003) and the MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome) in Saudi Arabia (2012). Currently, the world is struggling with the novel CoV (SARS-CoV-2), initially recognized in China in late 2019. Since its discovery, SARS-CoV-2 has spread globally and its epidemic disease (COVID-19) has claimed thousands of lives. To date, the high number of infected cases with severe respiratory illnesses and viral pneumonia is observed as a risky and rapid human-to-human transmission occurance (Ashour et al., 2020).Receptor recognition is a significant element of SARS-CoV-2 infection, pathogenesis, determining host range, and a therapeutic target (Wang et al., 2020a; Shang et al., 2020). SARS-COV-2-spike S protein (SARS-COV-2-S), similar to SARS-CoV, exploits human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for its entry. Using the same entrance receptor as SARS-CoV, the same set of cells can be targeted and infected by SARS-CoV-2 (Rabi et al., 2020). In situ analysis of different tissues has revealed top primary vulnerable cells to SARS-CoV-2, including the AT2 lung cells and macrophages, adrenal gland stromal cells, cardiomyocytes, thyroid, ovary, and stromal testis cells. Some other cells are less likely to be the main targets of SARS-CoV-2 (including enterocytes, cholangiocytes, and the kidney proximal tubule cells) (Zhou et al., 2020).Although binding to host cells is the initial step of infection, virus entrance necessities the cleavage of S protein via host proteases including cell surface transmembrane protease/serine (TMPRSS) proteases, cathepsins, furin, elastase, factor Xa, and trypsin (Lambertz et al., 2019; Ji et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020; Luan et al., 2020). Evidence suggests that numerous respiratory viruses hijack host proteases in order to enhance their spread in the host body. Based on the accessibility of cellular proteases needed for SARS-S activation, SARS-CoV-2 entrance and activation can be mediated by two distinct ways; 1) by endocytosis and the cutting of the SARS-COV-2-S by cathepsin L in endosomes (Glowacka et al., 2011; Shirato et al., 2013) and 2) by TMPRSS2 provided that it is co-expressed with ACE2 on the target cells’ surface (Heurich et al., 2014). This binding process entails several conformational alternations in the viral envelope glycoproteins (Shen et al., 2017), resulting in virion internalization. Since SARS-CoV-2 employs host proteases as its entrance activators, their inhibitors may exert therapeutic benefits against COVID-19 (Bestle et al., 2020a) and SARS-CoV infections (Shrimp et al., 2020). In the present review, we will highlight the recent updates on the functional role of host proteases, specially TMPRSS2 and furin in viral infection and discuss the possible interventions for inhibiting these enzymes.SARS-CoV-2 VirionThe SARS-CoV-2 virion is a non-segmented RNA-positive virus (Zumla et al., 2016). Its genome encodes nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M), envelope (E), and spike (S) structural proteins. The M and E proteins are located among the spike proteins in the viral envelope (Figure 1A). The virion has a nucleocapsid composed of a single-stranded and positive-sense RNA in a size of 29.9 kb and highly immunogenic phosphorylated N-protein that is covered by the S and the hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) spike proteins, buried inside the phospholipid bilayers (Wu et al., 2020a; Jin et al., 2020).FIGURE 1 FIGURE 1. Architecture of SARS-CoV-2 virus (A) SARS-CoV-2 schematic (B) spike protein, (C) alignment of SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV sequences in protease cleavage sites S1/S2 and S2. A furin cleavage motif (RRAR) only exists in the SARS-CoV-2 spike. Trypsin, furin, and TMPRSS2 and 4 can cleave the S1/S2 site within the receptor binding domain (RBD) of S protein generating the optimal conformation for viral binding to the host ACE2 receptor. The viral membrane fusion with the host membrane S2 domain can be cleaved by TMPRSS 2 and 4. Panel C is adapted from Luan et al. (2020).The SARS-CoV-2 genome has a highly similar identity to the human SARS-CoV (80%) (Matsuyama et al., 2010), hence, they have analogous pathogenesis and biochemical interactions. The S protein eases receptor-binding and viral entrance into the target cells by the fusion of the viral and host cell membranes; hence, it can determine the host range (Heurich et al., 2014; Hoffmann et al., 2020a). Moreover, the spike S is the common target for vaccines and neutralizing antibodies. Spike protein has two functional subunits; the surface unit (S1) and S2 (Figure 1B). The S1 recognizes a cellular receptor by a receptor-binding domain (RBD), mediating viral attachment to the host ACE2. The S2 subunit has other basic features needed for the fusion of the viral and cell membranes. The high cleavable properties of the S1/S2 cleavage site of SARS-2-S are attributed to its multi-basic structure (several arginine residues).In the CoVs, the RBD can be in a standing-up or a lying-down state. The first state permits receptor binding; however, the second state does not (Yuan et al., 2017). SARS-CoV-2-S is frequently in the lying-down state in comparison to SARS-CoV; consequently, despite having high affinity, it is less available to the ACE2. This difference results in a lower or comparable receptor binding affinity for the SARS-CoV-2 whole spike (Shang et al., 2020). The SARS-CoV-2’ RBD has a greater affinity to bind to the ACE2 than SARS-CoV; conversely, the whole spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 cannot bind to human ACE2 stronger than SARS-CoV’ spike (Shang et al., 2020). To preserve its RBD less accessible while retaining its high infectivity, SARS-CoV-2 depends on a second strategy; the activation of host proteases (Figure 1C).Entry and Priming of SARS-CoV-2 by the Host ProteasesThe high binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 to the human receptor is one reason why it is more hostile than SARS-CoV (Wu et al., 2020a; Lu et al., 2020). The viral infectivity highly relies on the cleavage of the S protein by the cell proteases that happens during different steps in the viral life cycle (Heurich et al., 2014). Two cellular proteolytic systems were utilized by SARS-CoV in order to guarantee the adequate processing of viral S protein (Figure 2). The SARS-CoV-2 interaction with the human cells is similar to SARS-CoV (Ragia and Manolopoulos, 2020). The proteolysis of the two peptide bonds (i.e., Arg685-Ser686) results in the so-called S1 and S2 subunits separation and the subsequent activation/priming of the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 (Fuentes-Prior, 2021). The presence of receptor-binding domain (RBD) in the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the S1 subunit causes direct binding to the peptidase domain of ACE2, whereas, the C-terminal of the S2 subunit is responsible for its attachment viral envelope after proteolysis at the S1/S2 site and eventually leads to its fusion with the host cell membrane (Benton et al., 2020; Ragia and Manolopoulos, 2020). Furin-mediated proteolysis results in the pre-activation of the S proteins in the SARS-CoV-2 virions besides entailing the cleavage of a single bond, Arg815-Ser816, for fusion machinery activation. The abovementioned exclusive properties of SARS-CoV-2 are indispensable for S protein-mediated cell–cell fusion and human cell entry (Fuentes-Prior, 2021). Additionally, early priming of the S protein depends on human TMPRSS2, which is necessary for SARS-CoV-2 entry (Ragia and Manolopoulos, 2020).FIGURE 2 FIGURE 2. The role of human host proteases on SARS-CoV-2 entry. Virus entry through (A) endosomal pathway and (B) TMPRSS2 and furin.The binding of the SARS-S to the ACE2 can promote the virions endocytosis. It is reported that Cathepsin L cleaves the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 functionally and promotes viral entry (Zhao et al., 2021). SARS-S/ACE2 complex generates conformational changes in SARS-S, which in turn, may raise the sensitivity of the spike to proteolytic enzymes. Inside the endosome, Cathepsin L, a pH-dependent endosomal or lysosomal protease, facilitates the cleavage of SARS-S and activates the S protein for fusion within the endosomal membrane. During endosome maturation, the low pH of the endosomal environment activates the re-arrangement of HA that exposes the viral fusion peptide into the endosomal membrane (Shen et al., 2017; Simmons et al., 2013), (Figure 2A). Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 induces the transcription and enzyme activity of Cathepsin L, which, in turn, elevates viral infection (Chandran et al., 2005; Zhao et al., 2021).Host Cell Proteases; General DefinitionThe SARS-CoV-2’s spike protein has cleavage sites for the host cell proteases guaranteeing the exposure of the fusion sequences and viral entry. It is observed the that lysosomal and cell surface proteases can both activate SARS-CoV-2 entrance. Furthermore, other proteases such as furin have accumulative impacts on the entrance of SARS-CoV-2 (Shang et al., 2020).FurinFurin and furin-like proteases are members of the proprotein convertases family. Furin, a kind of proprotein convertase, is a type I transmembrane protein expressed in all eukaryotic cells. It is activated by acid pH in the trans-Golgi network (Feliciangeli et al., 2006). Furin plays a key role in the cleavage of a wide range of critical cell surface proteins including adhesion molecules, surface receptors, growth factors, and hormones to produce mature proteins. Additionally, furin cleaves envelope glycoproteins of different viruses, thus, improving the fusion of viral membrane with the host cell (Garten, 2018). Data indicate that the existence of a redundant furin cleavage site at S protein of SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for its infectious nature than other CoVs, leading to its higher efficiency to fuse to the host membrane (Wu et al., 2020b).TMPRSS2TTSPs, a group of membrane serine proteases, occupy a vital role in numerous physiological procedures (Antalis et al., 2010; Antalis et al., 2011; Hoffmann et al., 2018). These enzymes are characterized by an extracellular C-terminal domain with the serine protease activity, a single transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic N-terminal domain. Böttcher et al. considered the TTSPs as the activators of viral infection. They indicated that the TMPRSS2 and the HAT (a trypsin-like protease) result in the activation of the FLUAV-HA and the spread of the FLUAV in the infected host (Hoffmann et al., 2018). TMPRSS2 is a single-pass cell membrane-anchored TTSP protein with 492 amino acids expressed on epithelial cells of some tissues and found to regulate cell-matrix and cell-cell interactions. TMPRSS2 expression seriously stimulates the replication and syncytium formation of coronaviruses in vitro and in vivo (Matsuyama et al., 2010; Shulla et al., 2011; Shirato et al., 2013; Simmons et al., 2013; Iwata-Yoshikawa et al., 2019a), exerting an important role in their spread (Iwata-Yoshikawa et al., 2019b). Furthermore, the TMPRSS2 might stimulate viral pathogenesis and spread via activating spike S for virus-cell and cell-cell fusion and neutralizing antibodies that decrease viral recognition (Glowacka et al., 2011).CathepsinsHuman cathepsins are endosomal proteases with broad proteolytic activity in acidic pH. Cathepsins activation in lysosomes may exert an important role in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV entry via endocytosis (Sahebnasagh et al., 2020). Lysosomal cathepsin L cleaves peptide bonds with hydrophobic residues in the P3 position and aromatic residues in the P2 position (Vargas-Alarcón et al., 2020). Cathepsin L incorporates in glycoprotein processing of SARS-CoV and Ebola (Pišlar et al., 2020; Vargas-Alarcón et al., 2020). Recent investigations assessed cathepsins’ role in SARS-CoV-2 entry. Further, the role of cathepsin L is highlighted in virion entry into human embryonic kidney 293 cells expressing ACE2; however, CA-074 did not significantly affect SARS-CoV-2 entry (Pišlar et al., 2020).Neutrophil ElastaseNeutrophils as a part of the host defense system, release a granular serine protease (the so-called elastase) in response to aviral infection (Thierry, 2020; Vargas-Alarcón et al., 2020). Increased elastase activity mediates acute lung injury through increasing inflammatory reactions (e.g., increasing vascular permeability, induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-8 and IL-6 secretion by neutrophil vesicles, and conversion of pro-IL-1β to IL-1β) (Bai et al., 2020). Under normal conditions, the NE’s function is regulated by the inhibitors of endogenous protease. Nevertheless, under pathophysiological conditions, neutrophil oxidants inactivate the aforementioned inhibitors which result in hydrolyzing the host extracellular matrix proteins such as collagen-IV as well as elastin and subsequent damage to the endothelial barrier and infiltration into the bronchoalveolar space (Korkmaz et al., 2020; Thierry, 2020).PlasminPathogens, especially viruses, convert plasminogen to plasmin in order to cleave surface proteins and subsequently can evade the immune system or infect host cells (Medcalf et al., 2020). Plasmin can cleave new furin sites in SARS-CoV S protein which in turn results in increased viral infectivity (Ji et al., 2020). In addition to the contribution of early stages of a viral infection, plasmin can provoke cytokine production and stimulate inflammation via factor XII/bradykinin which subsequently can increase edema (Medcalf et al., 2020). The elevated levels of plasmin (ogen) were observed in COVID-19 patients (Ji et al., 2020). Plasmin can cleave hyaline membranes (consist of a fibrin network combined with serum proteins and cellular debris, acts as barriers to gas exchange in the alveoli), which is considered asa histopathological hallmark of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) induced by SARS-CoV-2. In patients affected by the ARDS, bronchoalveolar lavage samples showed elevated levels of active plasmin and plasminogen (Henry et al., 2020).The Functional Role of Host Proteases in SARS-CoV-2 InfectionThe Role of Furin in SARS-CoV-2 InfectionBioinformatics analysis on the SARS-CoV-2-S sequences has anticipated a novel polybasic furin cleavage site containing an insertion of amino acid residues (–PRRA–) between S1 and S2 subunits (Figure 1C). Based on the genomic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, furin can cleave the viral spike protein at that site and activate it (Mallapaty, 2020). Coutard et al. identified a furin-like cutting site in the SARS-CoV-2-S which is not available in other SARS-like CoVs such as Pangolin, Bat-CoV, and SARS-CoV-1. MERS has a pseudo-furin- binding site (Coutard et al., 2020; Vankadari, 2020). Likewise, Vankadari found that structurally, furin interacts with the SARS-CoV-2-S that highlighted the mechanism of viral host cell entry (Vankadari, 2020).In lung cells that highly express furin and fail to express strong cathepsin L levels, pre-cleavage of the S proteins by furin is needed for consequent activation of spike protein by TMPRSS2 in both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (Hoffmann et al., 2020b). In order to initiate the membrane fusion of viral and human cells along with the passage of viral genome into the cytoplasm of the host cell, viral spike S glycoprotein needs to be sequentially cleaved at S1/S2 and S2’ “sites. Furin cleaves the S1/S2 site, while the TMPRSS2 processes at the S2” site, and these enzymes cannot compensate for each other. Finally, at the Golgi or endoplasmic reticulum compartment, nascent viruses are assembled and released from the infected cells by exocytosis (Hoffmann et al., 2018). Preactivation of furin permits SARS-CoV-2 to be less reliant on host cells, improving its entry into some target cells that relatively express low levels of lysosomal cathepsins and/or TMPRSS2 (Shang et al., 2020).It is revealed that the furin enzyme is expressed in other potential target organs of the coronavirus such as the intestine, colon, ileum, rectum, heart, and oral mucosa tissues (Dittmann et al., 2015; Mei et al., 2020). The furin universal expression in some tissues and organs may be an explanation for the high pathogenicity and transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 (Wang et al., 2020a). Therefore, in the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the presence of furin may result in some clinical symptoms (Dittmann et al., 2015), for example, the furin-mediated entrance of SARS-CoV-2 into the cardiomyocyte may clarify the cardiac injury in patients with COVID-19 (Dittmann et al., 2015). Moreover, the furin protease activity in the oral mucosa tissues makes them susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and may be associated with oral symptoms in COVID-19 like taste blindness and dry mouth (Mei et al., 2020).The Functional Role of TMPRSS2 in Viral InfectionAccumulating evidence reveals that SARS-CoV-2 and relevant viruses such as MERS-CoV, influenza A virus (FLUAV), and SARS-CoV require TMPRSS2 activity as a host cell factor for their spread (Hoffmann et al., 2020a; Kim J et al., 2020). Moreover, it is reported that the VeroE6 cell line, expressing TMPRSS2, is very vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection; indicating that similar to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 infection is boosted by TMPRSS2 (Matsuyama et al., 2020). Furthermore, both lysosomal cathepsins and TMPRSS2 have accumulative effects with a calcium-dependent proprotein/prohormone convertase (furin) on activating the entrance of SARS-CoV-2 in some cells such as lungs. (Shang et al., 2020).TMPRSS2, by cleaving the SARS-CoV-2-S facilitates virus entrance and activation (Hoffmann et al., 2020a). The co-expression of TMPRSS2 in ACE2-positive lung cells suggests that it exerts a critical role in the spread of the virus in the human respiratory tract (Heurich et al., 2014).TMPRSS2 eases the infection of SARS-CoV by two independent mechanisms; a) by ACE2 cleavage that enhances the viral entry and stimulates viral uptake by cathepsin L-dependent entry, not activating SARS-S for entry (Figure 2A), b) by SARS-S cleavage at the host cell surface that activates the spike protein for membrane fusion (Figure 2B) (Heurich et al., 2014). Two amino acid residues (arginine and lysine) within the ACE2 (697–716 and 652–659) are critical for TMPRSS2 and the metalloprotease ADAM17, respectively. These enzymes compete together for the ACE2 cleavage; however, only TMPRSS2-mediated-ACE2 cleavage stimulates SARS S-driven entry (Shulla et al., 2011; Heurich et al., 2014). The ADAM17 eases the ACE2 shedding into the extracellular space and stimulates SARS-CoV uptake into the host cells (Figure 2B). Additionally, ADAM17 facilitates the release of the TNF-α (tumor necrosis factor-α) and IL-6 receptors. The TNF-α exerts autocrine and paracrine function and TNF-α/its receptor signaling elevates ADAM17 activity. Viral infection and endocytosed SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins also elevate ADAM17 activity. An increased ACE2 shedding by ADAM17 leads to the down-regulation of ACE2 that increases the angiotensin II levels, resulting in further rises in ADAM17 activity (Gheblawi et al., 2020).Different residues (R667 and R797) in SARS-S control the TMPRSS2-mediated S activation indicating that these procedures are more complex than initially appreciated (Reinke et al., 2017). Glowacka et al. concluded that based on the location of the TMPRSS2, the processing of the SARS-S cleavage by host cell TMPRSS2 can have different results. In the secretory pathway of infected cells, when the TMPRSS2 is co-expressed with SARS-S in the same cell, spike cleavage leads to the shedding of SARS-S into the supernatants, and as antibody decoys, the S protein fragments inhibit antibody-mediated neutralization (Glowacka et al., 2011).Evidence proposes that the TMPRSS2 may control the function of mitochondria through the estrogen-related receptor-α (ERR-α) (Xu et al., 2018). ERR-α, a nuclear receptor, along with its coactivator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) regulate mitochondrial functions and energy homeostasis at the transcriptional level (Xu et al., 2018). Mitochondrial hijacking by SARS-2 may be one of the underlying mechanisms leading to COVID-19. Few human genes including a subunit of ubiquitin-protein ligase complex (FBXO21) and mitochondrial ubiquitin specific peptidase 30 (USP30) appear to be targeted by viral RNA (Pasquier and Robichon, 2020). During infection, viral RNAs can be translocated into the mitochondria to hijack and utilize host mitochondria. By modifying ubiquitination and impacting mitochondrial function, SARS-CoV-2 can repress host immunity in COVID-19 cases via different mechanisms. One possible viral mechanism can be mediated by regulating the host USP30. USP30 regulates the mitochondrial homeostasis and dynamics (fusion and fission). The presence of 20 nucleotides in open-reading frame 3a (ORF3a) of SARS-CoV-2 can target a sequence in mitochondrial USP30 transcripts (Pasquier and Robichon, 2020). Utilizing the host mitochondria by viral ORFs can result in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) release in the cytoplasm that activates the mtDNA-induced inflammation and represses both innate and adaptive immunity. Finally, the mitochondrial collapsing by virus results in the death of the infected cells (Singh et al., 2020).The TMPRSS2 GeneThe TMPRSS2 gene consists of 14 exons and 13 introns (44 kb in length) and is located on human chromosome 21. It is more expressed in prostate cancer cells (Paoloni-Giacobino et al., 1997). One of the important characteristics of the TMPRSS2 gene is located at position −148 with several 15-bp androgen response elements (AREs) at the upstream of the transcription start origin (Lin et al., 1999; Afar et al., 2001). In prostate cancer cells, androgenic hormones up-regulate the TMPRSS2 gene which probably is mediated by the androgen receptor (Antalis et al., 2011; Shen et al., 2017; Ashour et al., 2020). Studies in knock-out murine models revealed that these mice are resistant to the spread and pathogenesis of some subtypes of the FLUAV. As mentioned earlier, TMPRSS2 can be regulated by androgen and its receptor (Chen et al., 2019) and the presence of AREs on the promoter of the TMPRSS2 gene may be the underlying cause of the severity and higher mortality of COVID-19 in men (Zununi Vahed et al., 2020). Moreover, the promoter of the human TMPRSS2 gene has a guanine-rich region forming G-quadruplex secondary structures that can block or reduce TMPRSS2 transcription in the presence of potassium ions (Shen et al., 2020). Furthermore, studies regarding the TMPRSS2 gene polymorphisms that cause TMPRSS2 gene overexpression in humans, showed its association with severe influenza (Hoffmann et al., 2018). It is demonstrated that genetic variation in TMPRSS2 including two identified SNP in TMPRSS2 (rs383510 and rs2070788) had a strong correlation with the A (H7N9) influenza susceptibility (Cheng et al., 2015).Complete computational analyses indicated that functional single nucleotide polymorphisms of TMPRSS2 gene and epigenetic mechanisms play important roles in the diverse susceptibility of different populations to SARS-CoV-2 (Paniri et al., 2020). TMPRSS2 genetic variants including rs383510, rs2070788 37, rs469390, and rs464397 strongly increase the TMPRSS2 expression in lung tissue, where these variants at higher frequencies are present in European and American populations than the Asian populations. This result suggests these populations may be quite more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection (Irham et al., 2020).TMPRSS2 Expression in Different CellsRemarkably, the TMPRSS2 has a highly variable expression in humans and its expression may be positively associated with COVID-19 severity. The TMPRSS2 is mainly expressed in the epithelium cells of the prostate and has a vital role in its carcinogenesis (Lucas et al., 2008). Matsuyama et al. (2010) indicated an interaction of the TMPRSS2-expressing cells with viral tropism and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV infection. The TMPRSS2 is also expressed in the lungs (Bertram et al., 2012), digestive tract, kidney, the cardiac endothelium proposing that these organs may be essential targets for SARS-CoV-2 infection (Bertram et al., 2012). Indeed, the COVID-19 clinical manifestations include complications from gastrointestinal symptoms, higher liver enzymes, acute kidney injury (AKI), and acute myocardial damage. It was approved that the expression of the ACE2 and the TMPRSS2 provides SARS-CoV-2 entrance on the ocular surface cells. Moreover, the co-express of the TMPRSS2 and the ACE2 in the prostate epithelial cells may be involved in more pathogenicity of COVID-19 disease in males than females (Song et al., 2020). The TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS4 promote virus entry into the intestinal cells by facilitating SARS-CoV-2 spike fusogenic activity (Zang et al., 2020).Based on the different datasets of gene expression, it is found that the expression levels of the TMPRSS2 and the ACE2 are significantly higher in the nasal epithelium in comparison to saliva and blood, where their levels decrease in lower airway tissues. Significantly, the expression levels of these genes in the bronchial and nasal tissues are lower in children than adults. The result of this study indicates that the severity of COVID-19 between adults and children, in part, can be attributed to the different expression levels of the TMPRSS2 and the ACE2 in airways tissues (Saheb Sharif-Askari et al., 2020).Mechanisms that influence SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and clinical outcomes of COVID-19 are reported by analyzing the nasal airway transcriptome of children. In this study, it is found that the ACE2 expression is upregulated by interferon response to respiratory viruses. Moreover, the action of IL-13a upregulates the TMPRSS2 as a mucus secretory network gene (Sajuthi et al., 2020).Therapeutic Strategies to Target Host Proteases for COVID-19Unraveling the viral RBD features can open a new horizon to block the spike cleavage sites and develop protease inhibitors. Recent studies suggest that host proteases are vital for the activation of the SARS-CoV-2 in human epithelial cells, hence, they can be hopeful drug targets for the management of COVID-19 (Bestle et al., 2020a). Therapeutic inhibition of the TMPRSS2 and furin may be used as a therapeutic approach for COVID-19. A list of host proteases inhibitors is listed in Table 1. In the following section, we review the potential drugs or compounds that may alter the TMPRSS2 expression and activity.TABLE 1 TABLE 1. A list of host protease inhibitors against COVID-19Modulating the Expression and Activity of TMPRSS2Besides SARS-COV, the TMPRSS2 is critical for viral spread of the H3N2 influenza A virus (IAV) and mono-basic H1N1 virus (Hatesuer et al., 2013) and also for the replication and pathogenesis of the H10 subtype of IAV in mice (Lambertz et al., 2019), where knock-out Tmprss2 mice were resistant to the virus. This subtype can also infect humans emphasizing the significance of the TMPRSS2 for drug development against multiple IAV subtypes (Lambertz et al., 2019). The TMPRSS2 can also activate HCV infection at the entry and post-binding stages and involve in the persistence, pathogenesis, and sensitivity of HCV infection (Nickols and Dervan, 2007). Since the TMPRSS2 is involved in other viral infections such as coronavirus (MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, hCoV-EMC, and HCoV-229E) (Glowacka et al., 2011; Bertram et al., 2013; Gierer et al., 2013; Shirato et al., 2013), hepatitis C virus (Esumi et al., 2015), and influenza A virus (Shen et al., 2020), it would be an attractive alternative against a wide spectrum of respiratory viruses, especially SARS-CoV-2. Taken together, the TMPRSS2 is a target for antiviral therapy.As we mentioned earlier, the AREs are involved in the TMPRSS2 expression and can be striking drug targets. A polyamide compound can bind to the ARE in the TMPRSS2 promoter and moderately repress its expression (Nickols and Dervan, 2007). Wang et al. (2020) by mining publicly available data on gene expression, identified that the estrogen-related compounds including genistein, androgen receptor antagonist enzalutamide and estradiol can down-regulate the TMPRSS2. These reports suggest that the aforementioned drugs can be promising therapeutic candidates for the treatment of COVID-19. (Wang et al., 2020b).The promoter of the human TMPRSS2 gene has a guanine-rich region forming G-quadruplex secondary structures that can block or reduce the TMPRSS2 transcription in the presence of potassium ions (Shen et al., 2020). Benzoselenoxanthene analogs could significantly down-regulate the TMPRSS2 expression by stabilizing G-quadruplex structure and could prevent the growth and spread of influenza A virus in vitro (Shen et al., 2020). Therefore, the down-regulation of the TMPRSS2 mRNA through G-quadruplex structure stabilizers can be a promising strategy in developing novel small molecule drugs against SARS-CoV-2.Antioxidants serve as regulators of the protease/antiprotease balance that can prevent viral infection. Antioxidants—the so-called free radical scavengers- are natural or man-made substances that can prevent or neutralize free radicals’ damage to cells. It has been elucidated that the master antioxidant transcriptional factor (Nrf2) could down-regulate the expression of the TMPRSS2 in prostate cancer cell lines, thus causing alternations in the protease/antiprotease components balance and subsequently, and result in protection against the respiratory infections (Meyer and Jaspers, 2015). The Nrf2 has a critical role in the reduction of oxidative stress; besides, it exerts beneficial effects in respiratory epithelial responses to respiratory viral infection. Various types of antioxidants are available nowadays. Sulforaphane (SFN) is a potent antioxidant belonging to the class of isothiocyanates, a sulfur-containing organic compound naturally found in cruciferous vegetables (e.g., cauliflower and broccoli). It may decrease oxidative stress and inflammation besides exerting antimicrobial effects. It has been shown that the beneficial effects of the SFN supplementation depend on promoting the Nrf2, cellular antioxidants such as heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and NADPH quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) activities, thus, in turn, prevents the secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators. The SFN down-regulates TMPRSS2 levels and results in the protection against infection. Available reports elucidated that the Nrf2 negatively regulates the TMPRSS2 (Meyer and Jaspers, 2015). Kesic and colleagues demonstrated that the SFN exerts protective effects against respiratory viruses and reduces the IAV entry into respiratory epithelial cells probably as a result of a reduction in TMPRSS2 expression (Kesic et al., 2011).In addition to the possible androgen receptor-targeted treatments to modify the expression of the TMPRSS2, impairing its protease activity would be an alternative approach. Camostat mesylate, known as FOY 305, is clinically used to treat chronic pancreatitis. It could protect cultured lung epithelia and mice from infection with the H1N1 influenza virus (Bahgat et al., 2011). Shirato et al. report that the treatment with camostat (a single dose) could sufficiently hamper the MERS-CoV entry into Calu-3 cells (a lung-derived cell line) and possibly into the lung (Shirato et al., 2013). Moreover, the viral multistep growth was significantly repressed and virus-induced host cell death was hindered. They concluded that the camostat-inhibited TMPRSS2 or other serine proteases may determine virus pathogenesis and tropism in the lung (Shirato et al., 2013). It is also reported that the SARS-CoV pathogenesis and spread can be efficiently prohibited by camostat (Zhou et al., 2015). This drug can target the TMPRSS2 protease and reduce the replication rate of SARS-CoV-2 (Hoffmann et al., 2020c).Bromhexine hydrochloride (BRH) is a TMPRSS2 inhibitor that can attenuate metastasis in prostate cancer mice models (Lucas et al., 2014). Being an FDA-approved drug in mucolytic cough suppressants with no significant adverse effects, it can effectively be used against coronavirus infections (Barzegar et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020c; Fu et al., 2020; Tolouian et al., 2020). In this regard, Li et al. conducted a clinical pilot study on Chinese patients to evaluate the beneficial effects of BRH tablets in moderate COVID-19 treatment. Their findings illustrated that BRH enhanced chest computed tomography (CT), the need for oxygen therapy, and the discharge rate within 20 days (Irham et al., 2020). Nafamostat –an anticoagulant- is another drug that can inhibit the activity of the TMPRSS2, so, it can reduce the viral entrance and block MERS-CoV infection in vitro (Yamamoto et al., 2016). Recently, evidence from the latest studies showed the advantages of nafamostat in COVID-19 patients (Asakura and Ogawa, 2020; Hoffmann et al., 2020d). A case study performed on three elderly COVID-19 patients in South Korea demonstrated that nafamostat administration leads to disease prevention through regulating the complement cascade and blocking DIC. Furthermore, it may inhibit virus invasion by impeding virus fusion on the cell membrane (Jang and Rhee, 2020). Altogether, the TMPRSS2 has potential therapeutic benefits against respiratory coronavirus infections. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) is an effective membrane-anchored serine protease inhibitor. It can inhibit TMPRSS2-mediated hemagglutinin cleavage and repress the influenza virus in animals.Mc Cord et al. (2020) discovered that the PB125 could be used as a therapeutic agent in COVID-19 patients, evidenced by upregulated LIF, suppressed inflammatory responses, inhibited TMPRSS2 gene expression directly or by prevention of PAI-1, encoded by the SERPINE1 (Dittmann et al., 2015) and increased Nrf2 activity by HDAC5 downregulation (Hu et al., 2019). In the human airway epithelial cell line, aprotinin and synthetic inhibitors of the TMPRSS2 could inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV-2. Combining several inhibitors of the TMPRSS2 could result in a more effective antiviral activity against the virus than a single serine protease inhibitor. The top 12 natural compounds that significantly can interact with the active sites of the TMPRSS2 are reviewed by Rahman et al. (202).Furin InhibitorsUnlike the TMPRSS2, furin and furin-like enzymes are essential for several pathways and normal development, therefore, its prolonged blockade may lead to some adverse and toxic effects (Hasan et al., 2020). However, a brief furin inhibition may exert a therapeutic benefit and be tolerated (Sarac et al., 2002).To achieve satisfactory outcomes, a mixture of protease inhibitors would be required. The combination of furin inhibitors that target different proteases of SARS-CoV-2 might be an interesting therapeutic strategy (Wu et al., 2020b). Moreover, a combined administration of furin and the TMPRSS2 inhibitors can be used to target both of these proteases. Evidence shows that the combination of furin inhibitor MI-1851 with several TMPRSS2 inhibitors (MI-1900 and MI-432) could produce more effective antiviral activity against the newly emerged virus than any single serine protease inhibitor (Bestle et al., 2020a).Cathepsin InhibitorsThe inhibitors of cathepsin B (CA-074), cathepsin L (SID 26681509), and calpain (E64D) were tested in HEK 293/hACE2 cells. The findings illustrated that 293/hACE2 cells treated with E64D, had a decreased entry of the SARS-CoV2 S pseudovirions (about 92.5%), which in turn highlight the role of at least one of the calpain or cathepsins for SARS-CoV-2 entry. Moreover, treatment with cathepsin L inhibitor by 76% reduced the entry of SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirions, indicating the probable role of lysosomal cathepsin L in priming SARS-CoV-2 S protein in 293/hACE2 cells. However, cathepsin B inhibitor showed no significant effects on virus entry (Korkmaz et al., 2020; Sahebnasagh et al., 2020). Applying both the E-64D and camostat mesylate results in a complete inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 S protein-driven entry into Vero-TMPRSS2 cells and Caco-2 cells which proposed that both cathepsins B, L and TMPRSS2 is required for priming cells (Hoffmann et al., 2020a). The inhibition of cathepsin L offers two possible steps for the coronavirus infection, blocking virus entry on the host cell surface and viral material release and replication inside the host cell endosomes (Liu et al., 2020).Other Protease InhibitorsUtilizing sivelestat- a neutrophil elastase inhibitor- leads to acute lung injury (ALI) alleviation via enhancing alveolar epithelium, vascular endothelium injuries and reducing vascular permeability induced by neutrophils. Though it can be considered as a novel treatment approach in controlling ALI/ARDS or coagulopathy in COVID-19 patients (Sahebnasagh et al., 2020). The suppression of plasmin activity by antiproteases may prevent SARS-CoV-2 entry into respiratory cells and alleviate the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients (Ji et al., 2020).Clinical TrialsAnsarin et al. for the first time performed an open-label randomized clinical trial, to investigate the efficacy of early administration of bromhexine in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia in Tabriz, Iran. The oral administration of bromhexine results in a significant reduction in ICU admissions, intubation and mortality in the treated group in comparison to the control group. Furthermore, bromhexine treatment exhibited an improvement in C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) levels within two weeks when compared to the control group. However, their results demonstrated that there was no significant difference in the length of hospital stay among treated and control groups (Ansarin et al., 2020).Li and colleagues conducted an open-label randomized controlled pilot study to examine the efficacy and safety of bromhexine hydrochloride in the treatment of moderate COVID-19. The oral administration of bromhexine hydrochloride (for 14 consecutive days) improved chest computed tomography, a need for oxygen therapy, and discharge rate in 20 days. Nevertheless, their data were not statistically significant (Shang et al., 2020).Hofmann-Winkler et al. evaluated the efficacy of camostat mesylate in critically ill COVID19 patients with organ failure admitted in ICU of University Hospital Göttingen, Germany. Their findings revealed that the Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment score declined in the camostat mesylate-treated group; however, in the hydroxychloroquine group it remained high. Besides, camostat mesylate administration results in a reduction of disease severity, inflammatory markers and amelioration of oxygenation within 8 days in comparison to patients receiving hydroxychloroquine (Hofmann-Winkler et al., 2020). Doi et al. reported the efficacy of nafamostat mesylate in combination with favipiravir in critically ill COVID19 patients admitted to the ICU at The University of Tokyo Hospital. Nafamostat therapy targets the virus entry in host epithelial cells and impedes intravascular coagulopathy (Doi et al., 2020).ConclusionUnique landscapes of SARS-CoV-2 entry are low frequency of RBD standing up that is implicated for immune evasion; moreover, its RBD has a high binding affinity to hACE2 that provides an efficient entry. Finally, the pre-activation of the spike by furin enhances viral entry into some cells. All these features compensate for SARS-CoV-2’ hidden RBD and possibly permit the virus to preserve an effective cell entry yet evading immune surveillance. All these characteristics may be responsible for the viral widespread.Among different host factors that are involved in the entrance of SARS-CoV-2, transcriptional inhibition of the TMPRSS2 seems to be a hopeful strategy. As with scientific coincidences, our TMPRSS2 insights are obtained from cancer research. TMPRSS2 inhibitor could decrease prostate cancer severity in a mouse model. Additional evidence for effective inhibition of the TMPRSS2 comes from a report indicated that aprotinin could successfully inhibit influenza virus infections (Zhirnov, 1987), although the HA activating protease TMPRSS2 was unknown at that time—thereafter identified by Böttcher et al. (2006). Since the TMPRSS2 is vital for SARS-CoV-2 entry into the host cells, we propose that the same TMPRSS2 inhibitors may decrease or prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and can be an affordable medicine in blocking the TMPRSS2. The results of our clinical trial supported this idea and indicated that the administration of bromhexine is promising in the early stage of the COVID-19. It should be noted that transcriptional inhibition of the TMPRSS2 may not be destructive since it seems the TMPRSS2 has no important role in any organ and its blockade does not compromise normal development and homeostasis in the host. However, there are conflicting data on the role of TMPRSS2 blocking in the prevention and/or treatment of COVID-19. Well-designed and large-scale clinical trials are required to shed light on this issue in clinical practice.Author’s ContributionMA and SZV developed the concept and designed the study.

Will there be more sickness in 2021-22?Skip to main content HomeElection 2024Voter GuideLocalCrimeEducationStateNation & WorldPolitics Flu reporting season starts today in Kansas. Will lax COVID-19 policies result in more sickness this year?Jason Tidd | Topeka Capital-JournalInfluenza reporting season starts Wednesday in Kansas, and the removal of mask mandates in most of the state could prompt a worse flu season than last year. Kansas Department of Health and Environment influenza surveillance data show the 2020-21 season had four deaths where flu was the direct cause of death. Two additional deaths had the flu as a contributing cause of death.Those six total flu deaths are about a 96% drop from the 141 flu deaths reported statewide in the 2019-20 flu season. Influenza reporting season in Kansas runs from Sept. 1 to May 30.The last flu season in Kansas and across the United States had unusually low activity as COVID-19 prevention measures also slowed the spread of the flu."The mitigation to stop the spread of COVID-19, like social distancing, wearing masks, washing your hands, also helped stop the spread of influenza in Kansas," said Ashley Goss, the KDHE deputy secretary for public health, in an email. "We also saw a higher than usual rate of the population (particularly adults) vaccinated against the flu last year."While there is a lack of predictive data, Goss said it is likely that flu activity will return to pre-pandemic levels this flu season, "particularly in groups and areas of the state where active mitigation is less common.""The more people return to mask-wearing, frequent hand washing and social distancing, the more likely spread of flu will be less than in previous years," she said. "As previously stated, the mitigation efforts that were very active last flu season proved to be a very big factor in less spread of the flu."Dana Hawkinson, an infectious disease specialist at The University of Kansas Health System, said during a Monday media briefing that the hospital saw "hardly any flu" last season.He pointed to continued low flu activity in the southern hemisphere, especially in Australia, as encouraging signs for the flu season in the U.S. and Kansas. Flu season in the southern hemisphere happens during the spring and summer months and is often cited as an indicator for fall and winter seasons in the northern hemisphere.More: Residents can get up to $100 if they are vaccinated at select Dillons stores in Kansas"It's really going to be hard to predict what's happening (with the flu)," Hawkinson said. "There are such different restrictions, mandates, issues going out with every different country. We know that here in the United States, really there isn't a lot of masking that is going on. Some areas and geographic regions do have mandates; others do not."I think it will be interesting to see what does happen this year once we all go back inside. When it gets colder, we aren't able to do things outdoors anymore. And if there really is no masking or some of those restrictions are lifted, it would be interesting to see what is happening. I would expect we would have more influenza activity this influenza season than we did last year, mainly because of any lifting on restrictions or mask mandates."COVID-19 is worse than the fluAngela Myers, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Children's Mercy, warned the public to take the spread of COVID-19 seriously."It isn't the same (as the flu), it is more serious and it can be deadly," Myers said at Monday's media briefing from The University of Kansas Health System.The CDC provisional data as of last week showed 454 COVID-19 deaths nationwide among ages infant to 18 years old."That's more than what we would typically see from influenza," Myers said." A lot of people have come back to me and said 'this isn't a very bad disease in kids, and kids don't get very sick and this is like influenza.' That's not true."In a typical influenza season, we have between 100 and 150 kids pass away in our country from influenza. We've had 450 kids in the last 18 months die from COVID-19."In the 2020-21 flu season, there was only one influenza-associated pediatric death reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.More: Mayor Michelle De La Isla was septic and spent 4 days hospitalized after getting a pacemaker for COVID-19 damageMore severe flu season could stress hospitalsThe CDC reported an "unusually low" level of flu activity during the 2020-21 flu season and "dramatically fewer" illnesses, hospitalizations and deaths. The agency attributed the low flu activity to a record number of influenza vaccine doses distributed combined with COVID-19 mitigation measures, such as wearing face masks, school closures, staying home and physical distancing."While it’s not possible to say with certainty what will happen in the fall and winter, CDC believes it’s likely that flu viruses and the virus that causes COVID-19 will both be spreading at that time," the CDC says in an online question and answer webpage. "Relaxed COVID-19 mitigation measures (such as stay-at-home orders, or mask mandates) may result in an increase in flu activity during the upcoming 2021–2022 flu season."The low flu activity since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic could make for a worse flu season now."Reduced population immunity due to lack of flu virus activity since March 2020 could result in an early and possibly severe flu season," the CDC reports.As the COVID-19 surge fueled by the delta coronavirus variant has filled hospitals again, the flu could further strain limited resources, USA Today reported.“We do face this threat of multiple serious respiratory viruses circulating in our community simultaneously," Daniel Solomon, a physician in the division of infectious diseases at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, told the newspaper. "If that comes to pass, it could strain our hospital system in ways we’re seeing now with COVID alone."More: Experts renew warnings of 'twindemic' as US enters flu season amid rising COVID-19 cases: 'We face the same threat this year'Goss said the state health department wants to stress that COVID-19 vaccines don't protect against the flu, so it is important for everyone who is eligible to be fully vaccinated against both viruses."We are encouraging all Kansans to get the flu vaccine later this year," she said. "In addition to getting the flu vaccine, we learned last year that wearing a mask, washing your hands and social distancing work to prevent the spread of flu and COVID-19."Flu vaccines are 'more important than ever'Officials at the CDC and KDHE, as well as KU doctors, all say that patients can get COVID-19 vaccines at the same time as the flu shot and other vaccines. Public health experts generally recommend getting vaccinated early in the fall, ideally no later than Halloween, before the typical peak in the flu season.Hy-Vee Pharmacy and CVS Pharmacy are offering flu shots, company officials said in news releases last week.Flu vaccines are available at Hy-Vee Kansas locations without a prescription during regular pharmacy hours to patients aged 3 years and older. No appointment is necessary. Patients who get a flu vaccine can earn a 20-cent fuel saver reward.At CVS, appointments can be scheduled online or by walking into a pharmacy. For a limited time, customers will receive a $5 or $20 shopping pass with any vaccine visit."As the country continues to deal with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic it is more important than ever to stay current with vaccinations and other routine health care needs," CVS Health officials said in a statement. "By getting a flu shot this fall and taking other proactive measures to improve general health and immunity, individuals and families can protect themselves against seasonal flu and help safeguard the overall health of the community."

mRNA for seasonal flu vaccineSeqirus says it will look to build large-scale manufacturing capacity to support its sa-mRNA ambitions in the seasonal influenza space.Dan Stanton, Editorial directorAugust 31, 20213 Min ReadImage: Stock Photo SecretsSeqirus says it will look to build large-scale manufacturing capacity to support its self-amplifying messenger RNA (sa-mRNA) ambitions in the seasonal influenza space.Seqirus has long had a leading role in the seasonal influenza space through its portfolio of products, including both egg-based and cell-based vaccine.But now the firm is stepping up its efforts to develop a flu vaccine based on mRNA, launching a dedicated program to support development of its next-generation sa-mRNA platform with plans to set up scaled-up manufacturing capabilities.Image: Stock Photo Secrets“Across our global manufacturing network, Seqirus is expanding our capabilities to support increased supply of new and existing technologies,” Roberta Duncan, Seqirus’ newly appointed VP of mRNA Program Lead told BioProcess Insider.“Building large scale capacity for sa-mRNA manufacturing is really an incremental addition to our current manufacturing network. We are currently considering a number of global locations to establish scaled manufacturing capabilities for our sa-mRNA platform technology. Additionally, at our sites across the US, UK, and Australia, we are currently working to implement new programs to support sa-mRNA vaccine development and manufacturing, specifically.”Investment specifics were not divulged but both Seqirus and parent firm CSL are committed to advancing the technology, and “are well positioned to make strategic investments to accelerate the development of our next generation sa-mRNA influenza vaccine technology,” Duncan said.Next-generation mRNAmRNA has made the headlines over the past year due to its success in rolling out vaccines for COVID-19. Vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna have been administered to hundreds of millions, under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), and this week the former received full US FDA approval.But while the news from Seqirus has accelerated the industry’s research into mRNA vaccines, Duncan said Seqirus has been researching this technology’s viability in influenza vaccines for a number of years.“Seqirus is currently undertaking pre-clinical work on an sa-mRNA-based flu vaccine, with plans to initiate human clinical trials in the second half of 2022,” she said, before explaining how sa-mRNA differs from ‘traditional’ mRNA.“Traditional mRNA vaccines help protect against infectious diseases by giving instructions to cells in the body to make a protein, stimulating the immune response and leaving a blueprint to recognize and fight future infection,” she explained.“Seqirus’ sa-mRNA is the next generation version of mRNA technology. Sa-mRNA also gives the body instructions to replicate mRNA, amplifying the amount of protein made, with the potential to use less antigen. In preclinical research, sa-mRNA technology demonstrated the potential to raise stronger cellular responses and generate significantly higher antibody titers at the same dose level as mRNA.”Mixed technologiesWhile the firm is turning towards mRNA for future seasonal vaccines, Duncan said it will not replace other technologies and products both in development and on the market.“We will continue to invest in our new technologies, as well as our existing technologies – egg, cell and adjuvant – to provide effective protection against influenza. We foresee multiple technologies will co-exist in the foreseeable future,” she said.“Each of these technologies has demonstrated the ability to protect against influenza, and we see sa-mRNA as an important potential addition to our portfolio, not an instead.”About the AuthorDan StantonEditorial directorJournalist covering the international biopharmaceutical manufacturing and processing industries.Founder and editor of Bioprocess Insider, a daily news offshoot of publication Bioprocess International, with expertise in the pharmaceutical and healthcare sectors, in particular, the following niches: CROs, CDMOs, M&A, IPOs, biotech, bioprocessing methods and equipment, drug delivery, regulatory affairs and business development.From London, UK originally but currently based in Montpellier, France through a round-a-bout adventure that has seen me live and work in Leeds (UK), London, New Zealand, and China.See more from Dan StantonYou May Also LikeWebinarsAsk the Expert webcastsATE WebcastsRegister Now: AAE-MS™: A Powerful Method to Assess Host Cell Protein ELISA Fit for PurposeRegister Now: AAE-MS™: A Powerful Method to Assess Host Cell Protein ELISA Fit for PurposeAsk the Expert webcastsATE WebcastsRegister Now: Evaluation of a New Multimodal Anion Exchange Resin for Emerging Biotherapeutic Process ChallengesRegister Now: Evaluation of a New Multimodal Anion Exchange Resin for Emerging Biotherapeutic Process ChallengesAsk the Expert webcastsATE WebcastsRegister Now: Linking mAb Product Quality Profile Changes to Your Bioprocess: Case Study of Dynamic Glucose Level Control in CHO Process Improves Product QualityRegister Now: Linking mAb Product Quality Profile Changes to Your Bioprocess: Case Study of Dynamic Glucose Level Control in CHO Process Improves Product QualityLatest ContentRegister Now: Linking mAb Product Quality Profile Changes to Your Bioprocess: Case Study of Dynamic Glucose Level Control in CHO Process Improves Product QualityNov 8, 2024Empowering Modern Drug Product Development: Breakthroughs in High-Concentration Formulations and Drug-Device Combination ProductsNov 8, 2024|1 Min ReadRedefining Scalability: Strategies for Enhancing Early Drug Development to Future-Proof Later StagesNov 8, 2024|1 Min ReadTalent dearth continues to puzzle life sciences industry, says recruitment expertTalent dearth continues to puzzle life sciences, says recruitment expertNov 8, 2024|2 Min ReadGet the NewsSUBSCRIBESUBSCRIBEInnovationsWuXi Bio white paperSponsored ContentEmpowering Modern Drug Product Development: Breakthroughs in High-Concentration Formulations and Drug-Device Combination ProductsEmpowering Modern Drug Product Development: Breakthroughs in High-Concentration Formulations and Drug-Device Combination ProductsNov 8, 2024Bora white paperSponsored ContentRedefining Scalability: Strategies for Enhancing Early Drug Development to Future-Proof Later StagesRedefining Scalability: Strategies for Enhancing Early Drug Development to Future-Proof Later StagesNov 8, 2024ValGenesis Ask the Expert webinarSponsored ContentOut of the Box Computer Software Assurance with ValGenesis VLMSOut of the Box Computer Software Assurance with ValGenesis VLMSNov 7, 2024BPI PodcastsContent SpotlightPodcast: Sustainability is about health equity, says ScaleReady and GermfreeScaleReady and Germfree discuss the need to rethink sustainability and move towards a more standardized and simplistic manufacturing model to ensure health equity can be achieved.Listen NowBPI ContentBPI ArchiveBioProcess Insider NewsSubscribe to BioProcess Insider NewsletterResourcesEventsWebinarsWhite PapersPostersVideosPodcastsAbout BPIWho We AreEditorial AdvisorsAuthor GuidelinesAdvertising/Media KitList Rental/ReprintsCareersJoin UsSubscribeFollow UsCopyright © 2024 Informa Connect Limited.

However, patients with advanced PD may have less access to vaccinations according to a new study published in the Journal of Parkinson's Disease. More than 30% of patients surveyed did not know whether their physicians recommended vaccines, and 13% believed that providers recommended against them. The investigators advise neurologists to actively encourage vaccinations for patients with PD in the light of COVID-19. Individuals with PD may be at higher risk of contracting and suffering complications of respiratory illnesses such as influenza and pneumonia, for which vaccines are readily available, recommended, and safe. Prior studies suggest that patients with PD are at higher risk of morbidity and mortality from such illnesses, highlighting the critical need to ensure access to routine vaccinations. During home visits for our most advanced and homebound patients it quickly became clear that these patients and families had not only lost regular follow-up care with their movement disorders specialists, but many had been unable to see their primary care physicians for quite some time, too. A single infection can land these patients in the hospital. When we asked our patients if they had received their influenza vaccine, many indicated they had not." Jori Fleisher, MD, MSCE, Section of Movement Disorders, Department of Neurological Sciences, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, USA Based on these findings, Dr. Fleisher and her co-investigators undertook research to determine how frequently age-appropriate vaccinations—particularly influenza and pneumococcal vaccines—were being missed in homebound individuals with late-stage Parkinson's, whether there were modifiable barriers to vaccination, and whether the frequency and barriers to vaccination differed between individuals with PD who remained ambulatory compared with the homebound population. Investigators interviewed 102 ambulatory and 41 homebound patients with PD either through routine office visits or home visits between September 2016 and May 2017. Participants were 65 years of age and older and receiving care at the Marlene and Paolo Fresco Institute for Parkinson's and Movement Disorders at New York University Langone Medical Center. They were asked how many times they had received the seasonal influenza vaccine in the past five flu seasons, and how many of three possible pneumococcal vaccines they had ever received. Participants then completed a validated vaccine hesitancy survey to assess beliefs related to vaccines and healthcare and indicated how frequently they had visited a primary care physician, neurologist, emergency department, or hospital in the previous 12 months. There were no differences between ambulatory and homebound participants, but investigators found that 10% had missed all influenza vaccines in the past five seasons, and only 68% had received any pneumococcal vaccination. Homebound participants reported difficulty traveling to a clinic as a vaccination barrier. Among homebound individuals in particular, who rely heavily on informal family caregivers, nearly half the participants did not know whether or not household members had been fully vaccinated, and nearly 15% were certain that household members had not been vaccinated. While 19% of all participants reported refusing a vaccine, 31% did not know whether or not their physicians recommended vaccines for people with PD, and nearly 13% believed that providers recommended against them.

Meta-analysis highlights potential ICU reductionRemote interpreting raises concerns about communication quality in healthcareThrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura cases after CoronaVac raise concerns over vaccine safety"To our knowledge, this is one of the first studies not only to assess the frequency of vaccination in people with PD, but to go further by assessing modifiable barriers and specifically sampling homebound individuals, who may be at highest risk of both loss of access to routine vaccinations and deterioration from the diseases they aim to prevent," said Dr. Fleisher. "While this research was conducted prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, it is eye-opening how many people with PD were already hesitant, actively refused, or concerned that their healthcare providers recommended against life-saving, routine vaccinations." The investigators propose that while neurologists are not typically responsible for administering routine vaccinations, this does not preclude recommending or prescribing them so that patients do not interpret silence on vaccines as a tacit contraindication. The investigators also noted that being homebound does not mean that these patients are at lower risk of communicable disease. "Family caregivers can be the vectors by which influenza or pneumococcal pneumonia enters the home, and many such household members may similarly be missing routine vaccinations," added Dr. Fleisher. "Encouraging caregivers to protect their loved ones by seeking their own vaccinations is a simple, quick, and powerful step towards improved patient outcomes." "Knowing how often pneumonia or influenza can cause serious or life-threatening illness in our patients living with PD, it should go without saying that neurologists recommend routine vaccinations for people with PD. But that's precisely the problem: it has gone without saying," she concluded. "Speak up! Ask your patients and their care partners if they are up to date with routine vaccinations. With the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines, now is the time to advocate for preventive care and improve vaccine trust and uptake in our patients and their care partners."

Avian influenza refers to the disease caused by infection with avian (bird) influenza (flu) Type A viruses. These viruses occur naturally among wild aquatic birds worldwide and can infect domestic poultry and other bird and animal species. To curb further spread of the virus, the ministry of agricultural development and food security said that the movement of live poultry and their products (fresh meat, eggs and feathers) within and out of the Bokaa extension area is suspended with immediate effect. Biosecurity measures Movement of live poultry and their products transiting through Bokaa extension area is allowed only if: the consignment is accompanied by a valid livestock movement permit, transported in a sealed vehicle/container, and that the seals are only broken by veterinary officials at the destination. Poultry keepers have been encouraged to improve biosecurity measures in their facilities to deter wild birds including but not limited to: preventing access of wild birds to watering points, removing feed that is accessible to wild birds, deploying scarecrows to deter wild birds, as well as keeping poultry birds in bird-proof poultry houses/shelters and using footbaths with disinfectants when entering or exiting poultry houses.

With winter coming and flu resurgence a huge risk, ministers must urgently get a grip.”A Seqirus spokeswoman said: “Seqirus supplies influenza vaccines to all GP practices in England and Wales.“Due to unforeseen challenges linked with road freight delays, we have informed all our customers of a consequent delay to their scheduled vaccine delivery by a maximum of one to two weeks.“Seqirus is working hard to resolve the delay to allow customers to reschedule their influenza vaccination clinics.”Create a FREE account to continue readingRegistration is a free and easy way to support our journalism.Join our community where you can: comment on stories; sign up to newsletters; enter competitions and access content on our app.* FIRST NAME* LAST NAME* EMAILYour email address* PASSWORDMust be at least 6 characters, include an upper and lower case character and a numberShow* YEAR OF BIRTHYou must be at least 18 years old to create an account20062005200420032002200120001999199819971996199519941993199219911990198919881987198619851984198319821981198019791978197719761975197419731972197119701969196819671966196519641963196219611960195919581957195619551954195319521951195019491948194719461945194419431942194119401939193819371936193519341933193219311930192919281927192619251924192319221921192019191918191719161915191419131912191119101909190819071906* Required fieldsI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from Evening Standard.

Appointments for many patients had to be rescheduled after Seqirus, the largest provider of flu vaccines to the UK, confirmed delays of up to two weeks in England and Wales. The company blamed “unforeseen challenges linked with road freight delays” for the disruption. Delays have been linked to a lack of HGV delivery drivers (Jane Barlow/PA) “So we do know when there are low circulating influenza levels the year before, often we get high infection rates in the following year so it’s quite possible that we’ll have a high instance of influenza this year. “So it’s really important to get the influenza immunisation and really important to get it as soon as possible. “It is of concern that there are delays, but hopefully this will be corrected soon and we’ll get on in general practices, we always do.” Flu vaccines were also given at drive-thru centres last year (Jane Barlow/PA) GP Online reported that it had been sent a letter advising practices not to rebook appointments until they receive confirmation of a new delivery date for vaccine supplies. Shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth has said: “GPs are at their wits’ end, first forced to cancel blood tests because of bottle shortages and now we learn flu vaccines will be delayed. “This has been a summer of crisis for the NHS with patients paying the price. “With winter coming and flu resurgence a huge risk, ministers must urgently get a grip.” “Due to unforeseen challenges linked with road freight delays, we have informed all our customers of a consequent delay to their scheduled vaccine delivery by a maximum of one to two weeks. “Seqirus is working hard to resolve the delay to allow customers to reschedule their influenza vaccination clinics.” Dr Richard Vautrey, British Medical Association GP committee chairman, said the issue is likely to affect a “significant proportion” of practices. He warned of a “serious impact” on practice workloads and patients. Free flu vaccines will be available to more than 35 million people including all secondary school students this winter, according to the Government.
