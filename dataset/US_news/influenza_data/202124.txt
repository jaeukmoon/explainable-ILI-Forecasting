Vaccines are the best available countermeasure to induce effective immunity against infection with seasonal influenza viruses; however, the breadth of antibody responses in infection versus vaccination is quite different. Here, we show that nasal infection controls two sequential processes to induce neutralizing IgG antibodies recognizing the hemagglutinin (HA) of heterotypic strains. The first is viral replication in the lung, which facilitates exposure of shared epitopes that are otherwise hidden from the immune system. The second process is the germinal center (GC) response, in particular, IL-4 derived from follicular helper T cells has an essential role in the expansion of rare GC-B cells recognizing the shared epitopes. Therefore, the combination of exposure of the shared epitopes and efficient proliferation of GC-B cells is critical for generating broadly-protective antibodies. These observations provide insight into mechanisms promoting broad protection from virus infection.

Viruses have caused pandemics in the past and then became seasonal infections within a few years, but they still kill over 290,000 people annually worldwide. Pandemics are typically caused by viruses to which the human immune system is relatively naïve. Vaccination is an effective protective strategy against influenza virus infection, however, influenza viruses can escape the host immune response owing to their high frequency of point mutations (antigenic drift) and antigenic flexibility. Therefore, discordance between the vaccine strains and the circulating strains is an unavoidable risk leading to low vaccine efficacy. Thus, the development of influenza vaccines that are not susceptible to antigenic discordance is an urgent necessity.It has been shown previously that vaccination of C57BL/6J mice with inactivated A/H1N1pdm09 virus and highly pathogenic avian H5N1 virus predominantly induced GC-dependent and -independent antibody responses1. The adaptive immune responses induced by vaccination are quite different from those resulting from natural infection2,3. The inactivated influenza virus vaccines are highly effective in inducing protective antibodies against virus infection, but this response is quite narrow because the protection is only effective against the influenza strains used in the vaccine4,5. There is some supportive evidence that immune responses in a natural infection are relatively broad and have different immunodominant epitopes than those elicited with the inactivated vaccine6,7,8.Hemagglutinin (HA) is an important target of the neutralizing antibodies that interfere with virus entry and is immunodominant in the responses of mammals and birds9,10. HA is a trimer consisting of a stalk region and a globular domain containing the receptor-binding site (RBS). The inactivated vaccine predominantly induces antibodies recognizing the globular head domain of HA, and these antibodies generally correlate with the GC response11,12,13. However, these regions are highly susceptible to antigenic drift and the inactivated vaccine is sensitive to these antigenic changes.By contrast, several recent observations indicate that natural infection provides opportunities to generate antibodies reacting with heterosubtypic influenza virus strains2,14. The natural infection resulted in a different immunodominance hierarchy than vaccination2. Indeed, vaccination rapidly induced antibodies recognizing the globular domain, while the stalk-specific Abs are very rare because of the restricted accessibility of the HA stalk domain11,15,16. In a mouse model, vaccination with the HA stalk itself or the increased local concentration of full-length HA induced stalk-specific Abs17. In human studies, broadly neutralizing Abs (bnAbs) have been cloned from memory B cells of infected individuals and these antibodies mainly target the region of the HA stalk domain, which is highly conserved among group 1 and group 2 influenza A viruses, and heavy-chain variable (VH) region genes encoding these antibodies are heavily mutated18,19. These results strongly suggest that somatic hypermutation (SHM) of immunoglobulin (Ig) genes in the GC is critical for high-affinity binding to heterosubtypic HA antigenic determinants13. In contrast, the germline version of the human VH gene IGHV1-69 conferred pre-existing immunity without SHM by recognition of a bnAb epitope on the HA stalk20. Therefore, how GC responses in mediastinal lymph nodes (MLN) and GC-mediated SHM contribute to the bnAbs elicited by natural infection and the difference between the response to infection versus vaccination remain unanswered questions.The GC is generated as a defined structure in a B cell follicle of secondary lymphoid organs in response to infection and immunization. Activated B cells can differentiate into short-lived antibody-secreting plasma cells or enter into a GC, where affinity maturation of the B cell receptor (BCR), clonal diversification, and isotype switching take place21. The GC B cells further undergo clonal expansion triggered by cognate interactions with follicular T helper (TFH) cells in the GC light zone. The positive selection of GC B cells is driven by a BCR signal and a CD40 signal provided by CD40L on TFH cells. Downstream of either BCR or CD40, PI3K-AKT, and NF-κB pathways lead to upregulation of c-Myc, which is an important transcription factor for the positive selection process22. It has become recognized that regulation of metabolic pathways, including the mTOR pathway, plays a critical role in cell fate and functions of GC-B cells23. More recently, GC-B cells were reported to largely depend on fatty acids (FAs) to conduct oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)24. However, how TFH cells contribute to the clonal selection or expansion of the bnAb responses has yet to be determined.In this work, we show that viral replication during natural infection is an important process to generate broadly protective Abs recognizing the HA antigen of heterotypic influenza virus. Production of broadly protective Abs mostly depends on the GC response in the MLN, because protection against lethal challenge with heterotypic H1N1 virus is abolished in mice with reduced numbers of GC or lacking TFH cells. Furthermore, we also show the importance of IL-4 signaling during the clonal expansion of GC-B cells generating broadly protective Abs.ResultsThe infection and the vaccination control distinct antibody responsesWe have previously demonstrated that the inactivated vaccine was effective in inducing protective antibodies1. These antibodies recognized a 30% difference in amino acid sequence in HA antigen between the pandemic strain, A/Narita/1/2009 which is a pdm2009 virus, and the seasonal H1N1 strain, A/PR/8/1934. We first compared the protective immunity between the inactivated virus vaccination and live virus infection. Mice were treated by intraperitoneal immunization with the inactivated Narita virus or by nasal infection with the live Narita virus. Fourteen days later, the treated mice were challenged with a lethal dose of A/Narita/1/2009, seasonal A/PR/8/1934, A/Okuda/1957 (H2N2), or X31 (H3N2) virus. The nasal infection with A/Narita/1/2009 was effective against not only A/Narita/1/2009 that was used for initial priming but also against A/PR/8/1934. Conversely, A/PR/8/1934 infection-induced adequate protection against A/Narita/1/2009 (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1a). In contrast, nasal infection with A/Narita/1/2009 failed to protect against H2N2, Okuda, or H3N2, X31 viruses. These results indicated that protective immunity induced by initial priming with live A/Narita/1/2009 extended the breadth of protection to include heterotypic H1N1 influenza virus strains.Fig. 1: Live virus infection confers broadly protective humoral responses.a Top panel indicates the design of the experiments for protection against heterotypic virus infection. Mice immunized by intraperitoneal vaccination with an inactivated whole virus (left n = 3) or by intranasal infection (right) of A/Narita/1/2009 were intranasally challenged with a lethal dose of A/Narita/1/2009 (n = 5), A/PR/8/1934 (n = 7), A/Okuda/1957 (H2N2 n = 5), or X31 (H3N2 n = 9) at 14 days post-immunization. The body weight changes were analyzed in the mice with or without (UI marked with red dots; n = 3–6) immunization. b Top panel indicates the design of the passive transfer experiment. Mice were intranasally administered BALF or serum (60 µg/ml anti-Narita IgG) from mice infected with A/Narita/1/2009 followed by intranasal challenge with a lethal dose of A/Narita/1/2009 (left n = 6) or A/PR/8/1934 (middle and right n = 4 for each). The body weight changes were analyzed in the mice administered BALFs from uninfected (UI marked with red dots; n = 3–4) or infected mice. The mice whose body weight fell below 75% of the starting weight were euthanized. c A/H1N1pdm09 HA-specific serum IgG1 (top) and BALF IgG1 and IgA titers were measured in mice intranasally immunized by vaccination using inactivated whole A/Narita/1/2009 (white bars; n = 5) or by sublethal infection with A/Narita/1/2009 (black bars; n = 5). UI represents unimmunized. Bars represent mean; *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 by unpaired, two-tailed t-test (UI group with the other group in a and b, Vaccine group with Infection group in c). All error bars represent SEM.Full size imageNext, we investigated whether this broad protection was due to antibody or CTL responses. Thus, we obtained bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and serum from mice 14 days after infection with A/Narita/1/2009, and the BALF or sera were intranasally transferred into unimmunized C57BL/6J hosts, which were then infected with a lethal dose of A/Narita/1/2009 or A/PR/8/1934 to evaluate protection. BALF and serum from the mice nasally infected with live virus contained high levels of IgG and IgA antibodies specific for the Narita-HA and were equally protective against a lethal dose of A/Narita/1/2009 and A/PR/8/1934 (Fig. 1b, c). Meanwhile, serum from the vaccinated mice showed no protection against A/PR/8/1934 even though these sera contained equal anti-Narita-HA IgG levels (Supplementary Fig. 1b).To establish which antibody class among IgA, IgM, and IgG was responsible for the virus protection, the IgG or IgM were removed by passing the BALF through a protein G- and anti-IgM antibody-Sepharose column, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 2). The absorption of IgG, but not IgM abolished the protective activity against A/PR/8/1934 (Fig. 2a), indicating that the IgG class of antibodies was the primary component of the broadly protective Abs in the respiratory tract.Fig. 2: Anti-HA IgG responses in MLN are associated with broad influenza virus protection.a Mice intranasally transferred with untreated (black dots; n = 5), IgG-depleted (white dots; n = 6), or IgM-depleted (blue dots; n = 3) BALF from A/Narita/1/2009 infected mice were challenged intranasally with a lethal dose of A/PR/8/1934. The data indicate body weight change of uninfected mice (red dots; UI n = 3) and the transferred mice with BALF. Missing symbols mean that the mice were euthanized, as described in Fig. 1b. b Kinetics of viral load (PFU) in the upper airway (black and red dots) and deeper lung (white and blue dots) were examined in mice infected with 5 or 50 μl of A/Narita/1/2009 suspension (left n = 3 for each). The titer of A/H1N1pdm09 HA-specific IgG1 in the nasal wash and BALF at day 5 and day 9 were determined by ELISA (right, white bars and black bars for 5 and 50 μl, respectively; n = 4 for each). c Numbers of A/Narita/1/2009-HA-specific IgG producing B cells in BALF (white), lung (black), MLN (red), or spleen (blue) from infected mice at 14 day were determined by ELISPOT (n = 4 for each). d IgG1 antibody titers specific for or A/Narita/1/2009-HA in BALF from WT (white), Ccr7−/− (red), or Cxcr3−/− (black) (n = 5 for each) mice were measured at day 14 post-infection with A/Narita/1/2009 (left). Top panel indicates the design of the BALF transfer experiment for protective antibodies in Ccr7- or Cxcr3-deficient mice. Mice intranasally administered with BALF from WT, Ccr7−/− or Cxcr3−/− mice infected with A/Narita/1/2009 (WT n = 2, Ccr7−/− n = 2, Cxcr3−/− n = 3) were challenged intranasally with a lethal dose of A/PR/8/1934. The body weight change of mice was monitored until 14 days post-infection. Missing symbols mean that the mice were euthanized, as described in Fig. 1b. UI represents unimmunized. Bars represent mean; *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 by unpaired, two-tailed t-test (Untreated group with IgG depleted group in a, 5 µl group with 50 µl group in b, Lung group with MLN group in c). All error bars represent SEM.Full size imageWe further explored which respiratory tract region is essential for the induction of broadly protective Abs after nasal infection. To distinguish between infection of the upper respiratory tract and the deep lung, we attempted to control different arrival sites of the virus by changing the amount of liquid while keeping the virus titer constant; 5 μl was used for the upper airway and 50 μl for the deep-lung infection. The 50 μl condition led to a high viral load in the upper and lower tract, indicating that this system effectively introduced the live virus into the deep-lung (Fig. 2b). Infection in the upper and lower tract resulted in higher anti-HA IgG levels in the BALF (Fig. 2b).To identify which secondary lymphoid organ is responsible for the production of anti-HA IgG antibodies, we investigated the localization of the B cells producing anti-HA IgG. The MLN and spleen showed many IgG+ AFCs in response to influenza HA, indicating that the MLN was a major secondary lymphoid organ responsible for the anti-HA IgG response (Fig. 2c)25. CCR7 and CXCR3 are critical chemokines for T cell migration into the LN, and CXCR3 is a TH1 chemokine receptor that acts through binding the CXC chemokines CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11. The deletion of CCR7, but not CXCR3, resulted in reduced IgG antibody responses and protection against the A/PR/8/1934 challenge. Therefore, T cell migration into the MLN is crucial for the anti-virus antibody responses (Fig. 2d). These results suggested that IgG is the main isotype of the protective antibodies in the lung response to the influenza virus and that these IgG responses are initially induced in the MLN associated with the lower respiratory tract and then become systemic.Natural infection induces IgG Abs recognizing sheared epitopesThere seems to be a clear difference in antibody breadth between the inactivated vaccine and natural virus infection. We examined the binding to the HA antigens on A/Narita/1/2009 or A/PR/8/1934 of membrane-bound IgG on plasmablasts sorted from MLN. The binding analysis showed the presence of A/Narita/1/2009-HA single binding (single) cells and dual binding (dual) cells that recognize HA antigen of both A/Narita/1/2009 and A/PR/8/1934. The dual-binding cells were found in the mice infected with live A/Narita/1/2009 but were much fewer in the inactivated vaccine recipients (Fig. 3a). More interestingly, the dual-binding cells emerged only in the MLN but not in the spleen of infected mice, suggesting that the broadly protective Abs were the result of a local rather than a systemic immune response (Fig. 3b). In contrast, vaccination by intraperitoneal and intramuscular administration was not sufficient to activate the immune response in the MLN. We further analyzed the BCR repertoire of the antigen-binding B cells and compared it between the inactivated vaccine (splenic B cells) and nasal infection (MLN B cells). BCR sequencing analysis revealed that the HA-binding IgG1+ B cells in the infected mice had a different VH repertoire and a larger number of V-D-J combinations than the splenic B cells from the mice vaccinated with the inactivated virus (Fig. 3c, d). These results suggest that the dual-specific antibodies induced by live virus infection expressed a different repertoire of BCRs.Fig. 3: Selection of broadly reactive IgG is regulated differently from strain-specific IgG.a B220+IgM−IgD−Dump− B cells were obtained from spleen of the mice immunized with inactivated A/Narita/1/2009 (Vaccine, white bars; n = 3) and from MLN in the A/Narita/1/2009 infected mice (Infection, black bars; n = 3). Binding to A/Narita/1/2009-HA and/or A/PR/8/1934-HA was determined by flow cytometry analysis. b The data indicate binding to HA in flow cytometry analysis (left) and the number of single or dual-binding B cells (right) in spleen (white bars) or MLN (black bars) from the mice infected with A/Narita/1/2009 (n = 5). c Narita-HA binding B cells (2000 cells each) were isolated from vaccinated mice (spleen, white bar; n = 3) and infected mice (MLN, black bar; N = 3). The V-D-J combinations are shown by connected color bands between V and D (left), V and J (middle), and D and J (right). d Vh gene usage of A/Narita/1/2009-HA binding B cells in spleen from three vaccinated mice (Vaccine n = 3) or MLN (Infection n = 2) from two infected mice with A/Narita/1/2009. Total RNA isolated from sorted A/Narita/1/2009-HA binding B cells served as the template for cDNA synthesis followed by PCR to amplify IgG variable region genes. Amplified IgG gene libraries were sequenced by MiSeq. The IgG sequences were analyzed with the ImMunoGeneTics (IMGT) HighV-QUEST. e Seven hundred twenty HA probe+ B cells were single sorted and cultured on NB21.2D9 feeder cells with IL-4 in individual wells. After 20 days of culture, 303 IgG-producing cells were obtained. The binding of antibodies produced by these cells to A/Narita/1/2009-HA, A/PR/8/1934-HA, A/H1N1pdm09 derived LAH (blue), or rHA2 (red) was measured by ELISA. Finally, reliable binding and VH genetic information were obtained for 101 clones. Black circles indicate clones showing no binding to LAH or rHA2. Y-axis represents the ratio of the OD450 value in the sample vs the OD450 value obtained with IgG [anti-Narita-HA (1 µg/ml), anti-PR8-HA (1 µg/ml), anti-LAH (1 µg/ml), and rHA-2 (3 µg/ml)]. f Amino acid sequences encoded by Vh genes in single or dual-HA binding B cell clones in the region from CDR1 to CDR3 are shown with germline amino acid sequence (unhighlighted).

All error bars represent SEM.Full size imageTo further assess differences in the BCR repertoire between single-specific and dual-specific IgG antibodies, individual B cells obtained from the MLN of day 14 post-infection were sorted and expanded in mouse single B cell cultures (Nojima cultures)26. Among a total of 720 clones examined, 303 were IgG-producing B cells, and 49 clones produced anti-HA IgG antibodies at levels of more than 50 μg/ml. Binding analysis to the native HA antigens of A/Narita/1/2009 and A/PR/8/1934 indicated that 19 clones secreted single-specific and 30 clones secreted dual-specific antibodies (Fig. 3e). Fifteen clones of dual-specific B cell bound to a synthetic peptide corresponding to the long alpha-helix (LAH) of A/Narita/1/2009 HA that is generally hidden in the native form, and 7 out of 15 clones used V1-50-D2-14-J1 or V1-69-D1-1-J-1 (Fig. 3e, f).In general, the antibodies targeting a common epitope on the HA stalk domain are rare because these epitopes are also hidden in the native form. However, we found four clones binding to the stalk domain and reactive with recombinant trimeric HA2 (rHA2) of the H1 subtype (Supplementary Fig. 3). Clone DP14 and 44 used the same VH, D, and JH segments, V1-76-D2-13-J2, and bound to the rHA2 protein but not to the H1-derived LAH (Fig. 3e, f). The highest binding clone, DP134 used V7-3-D2-3-J1 and interestingly had undergone extensive SHM (Fig. 3f). Previous work indicated that SHM is likely not essential for generating the antibodies targeting the HA stalk domain27. Indeed, the number of overall mutations in VH genes of the dual-specific Abs was comparable to the single-specific Abs (Fig. 3g). Moreover, VH sequences in five of the dual-specific antibody clones retained germline sequences in their CDR regions (Fig. 3f). Therefore, these results suggested that nasal infection with A/Narita/1/2009 induced broadly protective Abs that recognize the common epitopes on the HA stalk domain and LAH. Interestingly, pre-existing BCR repertoires are responsible for the recognition of heterotypic common epitopes on HA.Virus replication is required for broadly protective antibodyThe above data raise another question of how the nasal infection with live virus generates the broadly protective Abs. We speculated that virus replication would be a key process to explain this outcome. TMPRSS2 is a critical serine protease that proteolytically activates the HA protein of the H1N1 virus in mice28. Indeed, mice lacking TMPRSS2 have a defect in virus replication in the respiratory tract and are highly resistant to A/Narita/1/2009 infection (Fig. 4a). We decided to take advantage of the viral replication defect in Tmprss2-deficient mice to test whether virus replication is required to induce broadly protective IgG antibodies. Nasal administration with a low dose (sublethal dose 0.3LD50) of live A/Narita/1/2009 failed to generate IgG antibodies specific for A/Narita/1/2009 HA (Fig. 4b). However, this defect could be explained by the insufficiency of the antigen dose required for T and B cell activation. Thus, the virus dose was increased up to 10,000-fold higher than the sublethal dose (3000LD50). Nasal administration of Tmprss2-deficient mice with the high dose of live A/Narita/1/2009 virus promoted detectable levels of IgG antibodies, which were 10-fold lower than in the sufficient mice infected with a sublethal dose (Fig. 4b). We analyzed the protective ability of the sera by a passive transfer after normalization of serum amounts based on the anti-Narita-HA titer. The sera from the high dose TMPRSS2-deficient mice protected from A/Narita/1/2009 infection but not from A/PR/8/1934 infection (Fig. 4c). Indeed, Tmprss2-deficient mice showed a marked reduction of dual-specific antibodies (Fig. 4d). Moreover, a similar protection pattern was observed in mice treated with the virus replication blocker oseltamivir during the live Narita infection (Supplementary Fig. 4). These results indicated that virus replication occurring during nasal infection is a crucial process for generating the broadly protective Abs, suggesting that the virus replication process is tightly associated with a structural change in the virus HA that exposes rare antigenic epitopes.Fig. 4: Virus replication in the lower respiratory tract induces broadly protective IgG responses.a Top panel indicates the design of the A/Narita/1/2009 infection experiment in Tmprss2−/− mice. Control C57BL/6 (WT) and Tmprss2−/− mice were infected with A/Narita/1/2009 (WT: 5LD50 n = 4 (white), 0.3LD50 n = 4 (red), Tmprss2−/−: 0.3LD50 n = 7 (blue), 3000LD50 n = 4 (black)) (left).

Missing symbols mean that the mice were euthanized, as described in Fig. 1b. d Control WT (white bars, n = 4) and Tmprss2−/− (black bars, n = 4) mice were infected with A/Narita/1/2009, and binding to Narita-HA or PR8-HA was analyzed at 14 days post-infection.

All error bars represent SEM.Full size imageThe broadly reactive Abs depend on GC responsesThe B cell memory response is thought to be critical for introducing SHM in the in Abs, and the acute infection seems to induce a B cell memory response. Indeed, we observed CD38+ memory B cells in the MLN at 10-days post-infection (Supplementary Fig. 5) and the infection conferred a broadly protective response for 40 days (Supplementary Fig. 6) . Thus, we asked whether the production of broadly protective Abs against the common HA epitopes depends on GC-dependent memory responses. Mice lacking TFH cells and GCs were prepared by deletion of loxP-flanked Bcl6 alleles (Bcl6f/f) by Cre recombinase expressed from the CD4+ T-cell-specific Cd4 promoter (Bcl6f/fCd4-Cre; referred to as Bcl6ΔT) or the B-cell-specific promoter of the gene encoding the BCR signaling subunit CD79A (Bcl6f/fCd79a-Cre; referred to as Bcl6ΔB). We analyzed the protective activity of BALF or sera against A/Narita/1/2009 or A/PR/8/1934 virus by the passive transfer system. In our previous work, the A/Narita/1/2009 protection induced by the inactive vaccine was unaffected by Bcl6 deficiency1. In contrast, the protection against A/PR/8/1934 was abolished in recipients of BALF or sera from the Bcl6ΔT and Bcl6ΔB mice (Fig. 5a), which showed a marked reduction of GC formation in the MLN (Supplementary Fig. 7a). The GC-deficient mice also showed a marked decrease in the IgG antibody titer against A/PR/8/1934-HA and in the number of dual-specific B cells (Fig. 5b, c). Nevertheless, there was no significant reduction in the response to nuclear protein (Supplementary Fig. 7b). These results indicated that the dual-reactive anti-HA antibody production in the MLN during acute infection is mostly dependent on TFH cell-regulated GC responses (Supplementary Fig. 7c). However, SHM and affinity maturation are not necessary for the broadly protective Abs, because germline BCRs reacted with the hidden epitopes on the HA stalk and LAH (Fig. 3e), suggesting that the central role of the GC response would be the expansion of the small number of B cells recognizing the common epitopes.Fig. 5: GC function is required for cross-strain protective humoral responses.a Top panel indicates the design of the BALF transfer experiment for protective antibody in Bcl6-deficient mice. Mice intranasally administered with BALF or serum (60 µg/ml anti-Narita IgG) from WT (white), Bcl6ΔT (black) or Bcl6ΔB (red) mice infected with A/Narita/1/2009 were challenged intranasally with a lethal dose of A/Narita/1/2009 (left) (BALF WT n = 3, BALF Bcl6ΔT n = 4, Bcl6ΔB n = 4, Serum WT n = 3, Bcl6ΔT n = 5, Bcl6ΔB n = 6) or A/PR/8/1934 (right) (WT n = 8, Bcl6ΔT n = 10, Bcl6ΔB n = 4, Serum WT n = 4, Bcl6ΔT n = 5, Bcl6ΔB n = 6). The data indicate body weight change. Missing symbols mean that the mice were euthanized, as described in Fig. 1b. b A/H1N1pdm09-HA- and A/PR/8/1934HA-specific IgG1 and IgG2 titers in BALF from WT (white bars), Bcl6ΔT (black bars), and Bcl6ΔB (red bars) mice (n = 7 each) at 14 days post-infection with A/Narita/1/2009 were measured by ELISA. c The data indicate single or dual-binding B cells in the B220+IgM−IgD−Dump− population from MLN of WT (white bars, n = 4), Bcl6ΔT (black bars, n = 5), and Bcl6ΔB (red bars, n = 7) mice.

All error bars represent SEM.Full size imageIL-4 controls GC-B cell expansion in virus responsesThe generation of the broadly protective Abs against the common HA epitopes in the MLN requires the virus replication process in the lower respiratory tract. Thus, viral replication may be necessary to create a unique cytokine environment that efficiently promotes broadly protective Abs. To examine the involvement of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, we examined IgG antibody titers in BALF against A/PR/8/1934-HA after the A/Narita/1/2009 virus infection. IL-6 deficiency reduced both the single- and dual-reactive IgG antibodies and the protective response against the A/PR/8/1934, indicating that IL-6 was not the factor that specifically controlled the broadly protective Abs (Fig. 6a, b).Fig. 6: IL-4 signaling is required for broadly protective IgG responses.a IgG1 antibody titers specific for A/PR/8/1934-HA- or A/Narita/1/2009-HA in BALF from WT (black), Il6−/−, Il1b−/−, Il10−/−, Il17a−/−, Il22−/−, Il23−/−, Ifnar−/− (white, n = 5 for each) mice were measured at day 14 post-infection with A/Narita/1/2009. b Top panel indicates the design of the BALF transfer experiment for protective antibodies in Il6−/− mice. Mice intranasally administered with BALF from WT, Il6−/− mice infected with A/Narita/1/2009 (WT n = 2 (white), Il6−/− n = 2 (black)) were challenged intranasally with a lethal dose of A/PR/8/1934. The body weight change of mice was monitored until 14 days post-infection. c Top panel indicates the design of the BALF or serum transfer experiment. Mice intranasally transferred with BALF or serum (60 µg/ml anti-Narita IgG) from WT (white, n = 2–5), Ifng−/− (red, n = 4), Il21ΔT (red, n = 4), Il4−/− (red) (anti-PR8 in BALF n = 9, in serum n = 6; anti-Narita in serum n = 5), Il4raf/+Cd79cre (blue, n = 2), or Il4raΔB (red, n = 4) mice infected with A/Narita/1/2009 were challenged intranasally with a lethal dose of A/Narita/1/2009 or A/PR/8/1934. Anti-A/Narita/1/2009 HA total IgG titers in serum were corrected to 60 µg/ml by dilution before the serum transfer. The body weight change of mice was monitored until 14 days post-infection. Missing symbols mean that the mice were euthanized, as described in Fig. 1b. d TFH cells (CD4+ PD-1+ CXCR5+) and GC B cells (B220+ GL-7+ Fas+) were analyzed in MLN from the A/Narita/1/2009 infected WT (white bars), Ifng−/− (black bars), Il21ΔT (blue bars), or Il4−/− (red bars) (n = 3 for each) mice. e The data show the percentage and number of single and dual-binding B cells (B220+IgM−IgD−Dump−) in MLN from the A/Narita/1/2009 infected WT (white bars), Il4−/− (black bars), or Il4raΔB (red bars) (n = 5 for each) mice. UI represents unimmunized. Bars represent mean; *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 by unpaired, two-tailed t-test (WT group with other groups respectively). All error bars represent SEM.Full size imageThus, we next focused on TFH cell-derived cytokines, IFN-γ, IL-4, and IL-21, which are produced by TFH cells in the MLN of infected mice (Supplementary Fig. 8). Ifng−/−, Il4−/− or Il21f/f Cd4-Cre (referred to as Il21ΔT) mice were infected with A/Narita/1/2009 virus, and then we tested whether their BALFs were protective against challenge with A/PR/8/1934. The Il4−/− mice, but not in the Ifng−/− and Il21ΔT mice, showed a marked attenuation of the protection against A/PR/8/1934 infection (Fig. 6c). More importantly, the Il4−/− mice also showed a severe reduction in generation of GC B cells after A/Narita/1/2009 infection, and Il21ΔT mice showed a partial reduction of GL-7hi GC-B cells, while the Ifng−/− mice had normal GC development (Fig. 6d). To confirm the importance of IL-4 in B cell responses, we used mice with a B cell-specific deficiency in the IL-4 receptor α chain gene, Il4raf/fCd79a-Cre (referred to as Il4raΔB). Mice transferred with antibodies from Il4raΔB mice were susceptible to the A/PR/8/1934 challenge (Fig. 6c). Consistently, the Il4−/− and Il4raΔB mice infected with A/Narita/1/2009 showed a significant reduction in dual-specific B cells and antibodies in the BALF (Fig. 6e).To directly prove the role of the IL-4 signal in the A/Narita/1/2009 infection, we performed bone marrow chimera transfer (BMT) studies. CD45.2 bone marrow cells from Il4raΔB mice were transferred into irradiated CD45.1 hosts, followed by A/Narita/1/2009 infection. IL-4R-deficient B cells showed less proliferation and a marked reduction of dual-specific B cells in the GC (Fig. 7a). These results indicate that IL-4 signaling is essential for the GC formation and the production of the broadly protective Abs.Fig. 7: IL-4 signaling in B cells is crucial for the metabolic shift during GC B development.a Top panel indicates the design of the BMT experiment. Irradiated CD45.1 host mice were reconstituted with a mixture of BM cells from WT (blue bars) and Il4raΔB CD45.2 mice (red bars) (n = 3 for each). The host mice were infected with A/Narita/1/2009 on day 31. Fourteen days later, Binding to Narita-HA and/or PR8-HA and generation of CD38-GL-7+, or CD69+GL-7+ cells in the B220+ B cells, or CD38dullFas+ cells in the CD19+Dump- populations, (right graph) were compared between IL-4R+ and IL-4R- B220+ B cells. b Naive OT-II T cells from WT or Il4−/− mice were transferred into Cd28−/− mice followed by immunization with OVA + alum. Frozen sections were prepared at 6 days post-immunization and stained with antibodies against B220, pS6, and CD4 (left 4 panels). Left panels illustrate the localization of pS6+ B cells in the spleen. Dashed lines demarcate the follicle area, and these areas are divided into 0.01 mm2 squares (white lines). Each dot in the violin plot (right top panel) represents the Number of pS6+ B cells localized in each 4 mm2 square areas. 154 and 99 sites were counted in the WT (white dots) and the Il4−/− (black dots) section, respectively. The bar graph in the bottom right panel indicates the mean number of pS6+ B cells per µm2. Scale bar indicates 100 µm. c mRNA expression levels were measured in splenic B cells from WT (blue bars, n = 3) or Il4−/− (red bars, n = 4) T cell-transferred mice. d Ki67 expression was analyzed in splenic B220 + B cells from the transferred mice from WT (n = 4) or Il4−/− (n = 4) mice. Ki67 expression is analyzed in GL-7+ (right) and GL-7- (left) B cells. Bars represent mean; *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 by ratio paired, two-tailed t-test (IL-4Rα+ group with IL-4Rα− in a), or by unpaired, two-tailed t-test (WT group with Il4−/− group in b and c). All error bars represent SEM.Full size imageA final important question is how IL-4 contributes to the GC response. TFH-B cell interactions in the GC light zone (LZ) trigger signals that control B cell activation and these signals are transmitted through the BCR and CD40, which activate the NFκB and PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathways29. The TFH-mediated signals positively select antigen-specific B cells, then these LZ GC-B cells can transit into the dark zone (DZ) to expand. In this context, activation of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway promotes the LZ GC-B cells by transiently downregulating the expression of Foxo1, a critical transcriptional factor for DZ formation30. Therefore, we speculated that IL-4 signaling regulates activation of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway. To test this possibility, we evaluated phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6, a target of mTORC1, on serine 235 and 236 using the OT-II T cell transfer system. Mice transferred with IL-4-deficient OT-II T cells were significantly impaired in the emergence of pS6+B220+ cells (Fig. 7b and Supplementary Fig. 9). The absence of IL-4 production by TFH cells also dampened the expression of c-Myc, c-Myb, Bcl2, Bcl6, and AID (Fig. 7c) and the expression of Ki67, a marker of cell proliferation, in the GL-7+B220+B cells (Fig. 7d). These results indicated that the IL-4 signaling controls the expansion of the rare GC-B cells recognizing the shared epitopes via the mTOR pathway and B cell proliferation.DiscussionThe present work demonstrated that infection and vaccination are quite different in terms of the breadth of antibodies generated. Unlike inactivated vaccines, nasal infection with influenza virus is a promising strategy to induce broadly protective Abs, targeting overlapping epitopes shared by different viral serotypes. We here propose that two essential processes during infection are required for the generation of the broadly protective Abs. Virus entry through the respiratory tract and its replication is necessary for the production of the broadly protective Abs. In this case, virus replication causes a structural change in the viral HA that exposes to B cells the shared epitopes that are hidden in the native HA structure. BCR sequencing analysis indicated that pre-existing B cell clones might be responsible for the recognition of the sheared epitopes. These B cell populations must be amplified by the GC response to efficiently generate the broadly protective Abs in the draining MLN. In this context, IL-4 had an intrinsic role to efficiently expand GC-B cells via catabolic and anabolic metabolism. Therefore, TFH cell-derived IL-4 is essential to facilitate B cell proliferation in the GC that efficiently expands the clone size of the minor population of B cells recognizing heterotypic HA epitopes.We have previously demonstrated that vaccination of C57BL/6 J mice with inactivated A/Narita/1/2009 virus and a highly pathogenic avian virus, H5N1, induced GC-independent anti-HA IgG2 antibodies that were mainly controlled by TH1 cells1. However, the present data demonstrated that these types of vaccines induced strain-specific antibody, that were effective only for the virus strain used for vaccination, consistent with previous reports that vaccination with the inactivated virus was less effective against a newly circulating strain4. In contrast, several lines of evidence indicate that antibody responses to natural infection are relatively broad and exhibit different immunodominance from those induced by the inactivated vaccine2,7. In humans, infection with A/Narita/1/2009 virus resulted in the broadly protective Abs recognizing other group-1 HA proteins6,31. Our mouse system similarly indicated that nasal administration of live A/Narita/1/2009 virus promoted the production of broadly protective Abs capable of recognizing a common HA epitope on heterotypic H1N1 viruses. These broadly protective Abs were predominantly generated in the draining MLN and distributed in serum and the lung. We used intramuscular vaccination in the thigh muscles but popliteal LN showed no dual-specific B cells (data not shown). Furthermore, the broadly reactive IgG Abs, but not strain-specific IgG Abs, were completely abolished in the mice lacking virus replication, suggesting that virus replication in the lower respiratory tract is required to expose the shared epitopes necessary for the generation of the broadly protective Abs.However, it remains unclear why virus replication expands the breadth of the antibody response. A likely explanation is that conformational plasticity of the HA structure occurs during the life-cycle of the virus32. The conformational changes could allow exposure of the overlapping epitopes that are generally hidden in the native form of HA. Therefore, the overlapping epitopes may be presented to B cells in the MLN GCs. Our observation supports this hypothesis that lack of virus replication caused a marked reduction of dual-specific antibodies. It is also supported by the presence of overlapping epitopes for induction of the bnAbs33 and the observation that dissociation of HA structure by acid treatment enhanced the generation of broadly reactive GC-B cells in secondary lymphoid organs34.Nasal infection with A/Narita/1/2009 predominantly induced antibodies that recognize the LAH domain, which contains conserved epitopes among HA subtypes, but this region is generally masked by the trimeric HA structure in its native state. Another class of dual-specific antibodies recognized the HA2 stalk region, which is less susceptible to antigenic changes33. Immunization with native HA trimers barely elicits LAH antibodies in humans or mice34, and the stalk-specific antibodies are also rare and emerge late in the response because of the restricted accessibility of the membrane-proximal HA stalk domain11. However, in the nasal infection mouse model with A/H1N1pdm09, the antibodies recognizing either the LAH or stalk domain were induced within the first two weeks and conferred broad protection against heterotypic influenza virus.Sequencing results indicated that two major Ig VH genes, VH1-50 and VH1-69, combined with a relatively restricted Vκ gene repertoire, recognized the LAH peptide of H1 that had 50% homology with H3. More interestingly, five different clones of VH1-69-D1-J1-1 contained a quite similar and extended CDR3 region. Previous human work has indicated that rapidly emerging antibodies specific for the stalk region frequently use VH1-69 genes and exhibit heterosubtypic breadth within group 1 viruses19. The human VH1-69 genes retain the germline sequence and provide pre-existing immunity to the bnAb epitope on the HA stalk without SHM20. Our sequencing data support this idea that the broadly-reactive mAbs can arise from germline sequences, because the dual-specific antibodies against LAH and stalk domain had few mutations in their CDR regions. Therefore, we expect that GC responses against heterotypic HA antigen may have different roles other than SHM and affinity maturation of antibodies.We found that IL-4 derived from TFH cells was necessary for efficient GC formation and for widening the breadth of influenza-specific antibody responses. IL-4 promotes class-switch recombination of IgG1 and IgE genes in mice and develops antibody-secreting cells via upregulation of the transcription factor Blimp-135,36. Gaya’s group has reported that lack of an early wave of IL-4 derived from NKT cells in the B cell follicle caused a significant reduction in the proportion of GC-B cells during influenza infection37. However, our data indicate the importance of a later wave of IL-4, which is mainly secreted by TFH cells. This is consistent with the report that GC migrated TFH cells are the most abundant source of IL-4 in secondary lymphoid organs38. Generation of the broadly protective Abs in the draining MLN was mostly dependent on TFH-regulated GC responses after intranasal infection with A/Narita/1/2009 virus. These results suggest that IL-4 derived from TFH cells plays an intrinsic role in the GC-B cell response responsible for the broadly protective Abs.B cell proliferation through induction of various target genes of the mTOR and expression of series of transcriptional factors critical for GC initiation and function, including c-Myc and AID was severely dampened in B cells lacking IL-4 signaling. These results explain previous studies showing that rapamycin treatment or a defect in the mTOR pathway in B cells resulted in a reduced GC response39, and that IL-4 promotes the expression of BLIMP1, AID, and the co-stimulatory molecule CD40 by GC-B cells38. In this case, IL-4 is most effective for B cell expansion in the early wave of activation, prior to entering GC recycling, based on our finding that the number of GL-7+ CD38dull PD1+ GC-B cells was markedly decreased in Il4raΔB mice. Therefore, we propose that TFH-derived IL-4 has a rather preferential role in increasing the clone size of the pre-existing B cells that have a natural affinity for the bnAb epitope on the influenza virus HA antigen.In conclusion, our data demonstrate that a distinct feature of the overlapping epitopes on the HA antigen between inactivated and live virus provides an opportunity to generate antibodies capable of binding to antigenically different HA viruses. Our data indicate that direct delivery of native virus antigen into airway epithelial cells in the lung could be a promising approach for the exposure of a sheared epitope that is typically hidden. This strategy may mimic the virus replication process that occurs in natural infection, thereby increasing the chances of expanding the clone size of very rare B cell clones able to recognize the common epitopes. In this context, IL-4 derived from TFH cells plays a critical role in efficiently expanding such a B cell repertoire. Therefore, a combination strategy of the delivery of native virus antigen in the lung and the activation of IL-4 signaling might be a successful approach to generate the bnAb response.MethodsMiceC57BL/6Jjcl mice were purchased from CLEA Japan (Meguro, Tokyo, Japan). Six to ten week old female mice were used for experiments. Bcl6f/f Cd4-Cre, and Cd79a-Cre mice are described in a previous report1. IFN-γ Venus, Il21 hCD2 and Il4 hCD2 reporter mice, Il21f/f mice and CNS2−/− mice were generated as previously described1,40,41,42. Tmprss2−/− mice were gift form Dr. M. Takeda (National institute of infectious diseases, Tokyo, Japan)28. Il6−/−, Il1b−/−, Il10−/−, Il17a−/−, Il22−/−, Il23−/−, Ifnar−/−, and Cd28−/− are described elsewhere43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50. Il23−/− mice were obtained from Schering-Plough Biopharma. Il4−/− and Il6−/− mice were kindly provided by Dr. K. Manfred (ETH Zurich, Department of biology, Zurich, Switzerland). Il4ra−/− and Il4raf/f mice were kindly provided by Dr. F. Brombacher (University of Cape Town, South Africa). Ccr7−/− and Cxcr3−/− mice were generated using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Targeting constructs for Ccr7 or Cxcr3 containing guide RNA and Cas9 mRNA that were constructed with primers listed in Supplementary Table 1 were injected into fertilized mouse eggs. Genotyping of offspring was carried out by flow cytometry analysis using anti-CCR7 (clone: 4B12; 1:200 dilution, eBioscience, San Diego, CA, 12-1971-82) and CXCR3 (clone: CXCR3-173; 1:200 dilution, BioLegend, San Diego, CA, 126506) antibody. All gene targeted mice used in this study were on a C57BL/6 background. Control animals were bred separately. All mice used in this study were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions and animal care was under the guidelines of the RIKEN Yokohama Institute.VirusesInfluenza A virus (H1N1), A/PR/8/1934 was obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA). A/Narita/1/2009 was propagated in MDCK cells (ATCC). Infection was carried out by intranasal injection of virus suspension under the anesthesia using isoflurane. A/Okuda/1957 (H2N2) and X31 (H3N2) adapted to mice were maintained by a passage in mice.Vaccination and protective assayFor vaccination with inactivated virus, mice have intraperitoneally injected twice with inactivated virus particles (10 µg) conjugated with alum adjuvant at a 7 day interval. For live virus vaccination, virus suspension (sublethal dose, 0.3LD50) in 50 µl of PBS was administrated nasally. To control the viral arrival point in Fig. 2b, we established a system to distinguish the infection site between the upper respiratory tract and the deep lung by changing the volume of PBS, while keeping the virus titer in the inoculum constant. For passive transfer, BALF was collected by bronchoalveolar washing and was concentrated up to 10 times with a centrifugal concentrator (Vivaspin 500, Sartorius, Göttingen, Germany). Serum HA IgG titers were normalized with 60 µg/ml of anti-A/Narita/1/2009 (Supplementary Fig. 10). Transfers of BALF or serum were carried out intranasally prior to virus challenge. For the in vivo protective assay, mice were given a lethal dose of influenza virus (5LD50) intranasally at 14 days post-vaccination. The body weight changes were analyzed in the mice with or without vaccination. Mice whose body weight fell below 75% of the starting weight were euthanized.ELISA, ELISPOT and measurement of antibody affinityFor the ELISA assay, the viral antigens of A/Narita/1/2009 or A/PR/8/1934 propagated in MDCK cells were captured on 96-well Maxisorp ELISA plates (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA) by anti-California (clone: RM01; 1:10,000 dilution, SinoBiological, Beijing, China, 86001-RM01) or PR8 HA antibody (clone: R107; 1:10,000 dilution, SinoBiological, 11684-R107), respectively. ELISA of LAH peptide and mini-HA, A/Narita/1/2009 HA 420-474 and recombinant HA2 (rHA2)51 were used as LAH52 and mini-HA antigens. IgG titers for the nuclear protein of influenza virus were measured by ELISA using His-conjugated recombinant Narita or PR8 nuclear protein (11675-V08B; SinoBiological) after capturing with an anti-His antibody. After blocking with 1% blockAce (KAC, Kyoto, Japan), antibody titers were assessed by anti-mouse IgG1 Abs (1:10,000 dilution, Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL, 1070-01 and 1:10,000 dilution, Bethyl, Montgomery, TX, A90-105P), anti-mouse IgG2b Abs (1:10,000 dilution, Bethyl, A90-109P), anti-mouse IgG2c Abs (1:10,000 dilution, AVIVA System Bio, San Diego, CA, OASB01582), and anti-mouse IgA Abs (1:10,000 dilution, Bethyl, A90-103A and A90-103P). After washing, isotype-specific antibodies were visualized using HRP-conjugated antibody and OptiEIA substrate (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). For standard antibodies to assess Ig subtype-specific antibody concentration, anti-H1N1 pandemic or seasonal HA IgG1, IgG2b, or IgA recombinant proteins were constructed based on two mAbs, NSP253 and S5V2-2954. For measurement of NP-specific antibody, antibody titer and affinity were assessed by the binding to either NP19-BSA or NP1-BSA. For ELISPOT assays, A/Narita/1/2009 antigens were captured by anti-Narita-HA (86001-RM01) on 96 well ELISPOT plates (MSHAN4B; Millipore). The purified B220+ B cells from BALF, lung, MLN, or spleen of infected mice were cultured for 20 h, then the antibodies on the plate were detected with anti-mouse IgG-AP 1:5000 dilution, Proteintech, Rosemont, IL, SA00002-1).HistologySpleens were fixed with paraformaldehyde (4%) and frozen in OCT compound (Sakura Finetek Japan Co, Tokyo, Japan). Sections (5 μm) were stained with anti-B220 (clone: RA3-6B2; 1:100 dilution, Biolegend, 103208), CD4 (clone: RM4-5; 1:100 dilution, Biolegend, 100530), GL-7 (1:200 dilution, BD Biosciences, 553666), and pS6 (clone: N7-548; 1:200 dilution, BD Biosciences, 560434) mAbs after blocking (3% BSA) and permeabilization (0.1% Trironx-100).

Intracellular staining anti-Ki67 (clone: 16A8; 1:200 dilution, Biolegend, 652410) was described elsewhere55. Flow cytometric analysis and cell sorting were performed on a FACS Calibur and a FACSAria III (BD Biosciences) and data were analyzed with Flowjo software (BD Biosciences).HA-binding B cells and single-cell analysisIgG+ B cells were isolated by the following antibodies: anti-B220 (clone: RA3-6B2; 1:1000 dilution, Biolegend, 103225), CD3 (clone: 17A2; 1:1000 dilution, Biolegend, 100244), CD4 (clone: GK1.5; 1:1000 dilution, Biolegend, 100404), CD5 (clone: 53-7.3; 1:200 dilution, Biolegend, 100604), CD8a (clone: 53-6.7; 1:200 dilution, Biolegend, 100704), CD49b (clone: DX5; 1:200 dilution, Biolegend, 108904), Gr-1 (clone: RB6-8C5; 1:200 dilution, BD Biosciences, 553124), NK1.1 (clone: PK136; 1:200 dilution, Biolegend, 108704), IgD (clone: 11-26c; 1:200 dilution, Biolegend, 405710), IgM (clone: RMM-1; 1:200 dilution, Biolegend, 406512), and TER-119 (1:200 dilution, Biolegend, 116204). HA-binding B cells were identified by APC-conjugated Narita-HA or PE-conjugated PR8-HA that was produced as described elsewhere56. The specificity of the HA-binding was validated with APC or PE-conjugated NP29-BSA (Supplementary Fig. 11). Analysis and sorting of HA-probe+, B220+, other markers− cells were carried out with a FACS Aria III. Single B cells culture (Nojima cultures) were performed essentially as described26,34. HA-binding B cells were sorted onto the IL-21-expressing CD154+ 40LB fibroblast cell line expressing CD40L and BAFF, NB21.2D9 feeder cells57 cultured in the presence of recombinant murine IL-4 (Peprotech: 2 ng/ml). Total RNA was isolated with TRIzol (Life Technologies) from the single B cell cultures. RT-PCR was carried out with a SuperScript IV one-step RT-PCR system (Life Technologies) and primers shown in Supplementary Table 1. BCR sequencing data were analyzed with the ImMunoGeneTics (IMGT) HighV-QUEST (http://www.imgt.org/) in comparison with reference sequences from the IMGT database.BCR repertoire analysisTotal RNA was isolated from freshly sorted Narita-HA binding B cells. cDNA was synthesized using a SMART-Seq v4 Ultra Low Input RNA Kit for Sequencing (Takara Bio, Inc., Shiga, Japan, Z4888N). Ig sequences were amplified by PCR using KOD Fx Neo (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) and primers shown in Supplementary Table 1. cDNA libraries were synthesized using a Nextera DNA Library Prep Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, FC-131-1096) and sequencing data were obtained using the MiSeq system (Illumina). Sequenced reads were analyzed with the IMGT HighV-QUEST (http://www.imgt.org/) after removing low-quality reads, trimming of adapter sequence, and connecting read1 and read2 using tools available on the Galaxy platform (https://usegalaxy.org).Statistics and reproducibilityStatistical comparisons between groups were performed using Prism version 8.0.2 (Graph Pad Software, San Diego, CA). Data represent the mean ± SEM. Two groups were compared using the two-tailed, unpaired Student’s t test. All experiments were performed at least twice, and the similar results were obtained.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.

We aimed to define the impact of secondary bacterial infections on the clinical course and mortality in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients by comparison with influenza patients. COVID-19 (n = 642) and influenza (n = 742) patients, admitted to a large tertiary center in Israel and for whom blood or sputum culture had been taken were selected for this study. Bacterial culture results, clinical parameters, and death rates were compared. COVID-19 patients had higher rates of bacterial infections than influenza patients (12.6% vs. 8.7%). Notably, the time from admission to bacterial growth was longer in COVID-19 compared to influenza patients (4 (1–8) vs. 1 (1–3) days). Late infections (> 48 h after admission) with gram-positive bacteria were more common in COVID-19 patients (28% vs. 9.5%). Secondary infection was associated with a higher risk of death in both patient groups 2.7-fold (1.22–5.83) for COVID-19, and 3.09-fold (1.11–7.38) for Influenza). The association with death remained significant upon adjustment to age and clinical parameters in COVID-19 but not in influenza infection. Secondary bacterial infection is a notable complication associated with worse outcomes in COVID-19 than influenza patients. Careful surveillance and prompt antibiotic treatment may benefit selected patients. Similar content being viewed by others Comparison of clinical characteristics and disease outcome of COVID-19 and seasonal influenza Article Open access 11 March 2021 Association between antecedent statin use and decreased mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 Article Open access 26 February 2021 A retrospective cohort study of 238,000 COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths in Brazil Article Open access 07 March 2022 IntroductionSecondary bacterial infections are a known complication of viral respiratory infections, often leading to clinical deterioration. Secondary bacterial infections were a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in previous well-studied influenza pandemics and during seasonal influenza, as well as in other respiratory diseases1,2. Mechanistically, disruption of airway epithelium and its barrier function due to viral-induced immune-mediated damage, and dysregulation of both, the innate and adaptive immune responses are thought to promote the colonization of various bacteria3,4.Despite the clinical importance of secondary bacterial infections, their contribution to COVID-19 severity and mortality is still not well established. Several studies addressed this issue, but variations in testing methodologies, site-specific nosocomial infections, different definitions of early vs. late infections, and differences in treatment modalities, complicate the analysis of these data5,6.Influenza and COVID-19 have different disease courses, with influenza having a shorter incubation time and disease duration7. These differences might reflect disparities in the magnitude and kinetics of the immune response to these pathogens, affecting the type and time of the appearance of secondary bacterial infections, as well. Here we compared early (< 48 h after admission) or late (> 48 h after admission) secondary bacterial infections identified in blood or sputum cultures of admitted influenza or COVID-19 patients from a single large tertiary center in Israel.ResultsCharacterizations of influenza and COVID-19 patientsA total of 1384 admitted patients with available cultures were assessed. Of these, 642 had a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (59.2% males, median age 68 (interquartile range (IQR) 53–78)), while 742 had a confirmed influenza infection (47% males, median age 67 (IQR 43–78)). Patients’ clinical and demographic characteristics are shown in Table 1. Laboratory tests known to correlate with inflammation were more severe among COVID-19 patients compared to influenza patients, specifically, maximal C-reactive protein (CRP) levels (median 13.41 (IQR (6.22–24.94) vs.7.05 (3.3–15.4), p < 0.001), maximal ferritin level (743.35 (330.7–1600.5) vs. 190.20 (61.2–351.4), p < 0.001) and minimal albumin levels (3.00 (2.5- 3.5) vs. 3.5 (3.10- 4.00) p < 0.001). In accordance with this, hospitalization length (in days) was longer among COVID-19 compared to influenza patients (7.00 (3.00–14.75) vs. 4.00 (2.00–7.00), p < 0.001). Furthermore, COVID-19 patients had profoundly higher intubation (19.2% vs. 4.4%, p < 0.001) and death rates (26.3% vs. 7.0%, p < 0.001).Table 1 Patient’s demographic and clinical characteristics.Full size tableCharacterization of the bacterial pathogens among influenza and COVID-19 patientsCOVID-19 patients had higher rates of secondary bacterial infections than influenza patients (12.6% vs. 8.7%, p = 0.006). To test whether there was also a difference in the nature of the infecting pathogens between the two groups, we further compared the different types of bacteria in each group (Table 2). For this purpose, we defined infections occurring < 48 h after admission as early infections, while infections occurring between 2–14 days post-admission were defined as late infections. Infections occurring after 14 days were disregarded. Interestingly, the types of isolated bacteria were generally similar between COVID-19 and influenza patients. While infections with gram-negative bacteria represented most infections (75%) in both groups, there were no significant differences between the groups neither in the early nor late infections. In contrast, late infections with gram-positive bacteria were more common in COVID-19 than influenza patients (28% vs. 9.5%, p = 0.01).Table 2 Main documented bacterial coinfections according to the type of viral disease.Full size tableMost secondary bacterial infections in both groups were derived from blood cultures (supplementary table 1).A notable difference was observed in the late gram-positive infections. In COVID-19 patients, 85% of these infections were isolated from blood cultures, while only 14.2% were isolated from respiratory samples. In contrast, among influenza patients, the isolated bacteria divided equally between blood and respiratory-derived cultures.Notably, the overall time from admission to bacterial growth was longer in COVID-19 compared to influenza patients (4 (1–8) vs. 1 (1–3) days, p < 0.001).The most common bacterial coinfection in both groups was Pseudomonas aeruginosa (32% vs. 25% of influenza and COVID-19, respectively, p = 0.5) and Staphylococcus aureus (17% vs. 22%, respectively, p = 0.6). Notably, a significant difference was observed in the percentage of Enterococcus infections between influenza and COVID-19 (0% vs. 8.6%, p = 0.018). Significant differences were observed in late Corynebacterium striatum and Klebsiella pneumoniae infections, as well.Parameters associated with death among influenza and COVID-19 patients with bacterial coinfectionWe next tested major clinical and epidemiological variables associated with death in the infected population from both groups, using univariate logistic analysis (Table 3). Only age 1.01-fold (1.00–1.02), p = 0.013) and maximal international normalized ratio (INR, a unified clotting measure) 3.83-fold (2.34–6.65), p < 0.001) were associated with death in COVID-19 but not in influenza patients (age odds ratio (OR) 1.00 (0.99–1.01), p = 0.6, OR 1.34 (0.94–1.85), p = 0.071, for age and INR, respectively).Table 3 Univariate analysis of variables associated with death.Full size tableNotably, almost all bacterial growth parameters tested were associated with an increased risk of death in both groups. Both early infection 3.09-fold (1.11- 7.38) p = 0.018 for influenza and 2.70-fold (1.22- 5.83) p = 0.012 for COVID-19), and late infection (4.78-fold (1.67- 12.0) p = 0.002 for influenza, and 7.00-fold (3.88–13.0) p < 0.001 for COVID-19) were associated with an increased risk of death, with late infections being associated with a higher risk. The total number of infections was also related to an increased risk of death in both COVID-19 (3.33-fold (1.86–5.96), p < 0.001 for one infection and 11.3-fold (4.95–29.2), p < 0.001 for more than one infection) and influenza (3.42-fold (1.47–7.26), p = 0.002 for one infection and 5.32-fold (1.15–18.7), p = 0.015 for more than one infection). The number of early infections (COVID-19, 1.84-fold (1.11–3.22), p = 0.022); influenza 1.92-fold (0.96–3.44), p = 0.037) and late infections (COVID-19, 2.91-fold (2.00- 4.46), p < 0.001); influenza 3.20-fold (1.45–6.59), p = 0.002) were also associated with an increased risk of death, with the later infections showing higher risk levels.The association of the number of secondary bacterial infections with death remained significant upon adjustment to age, minimal blood oxygen saturation, maximal CRP and minimal albumin levels, all variables of disease severity, in COVID-19 (one infection 2.48-fold (1.16–5.29), p = 0.019; more than one infection 7.64-fold (2.46–27), P < 0.001), but not in the infected influenza patients (one infection 1.11-fold (0.38–2.92), p = 0.8; more than one infection 1.21-fold (0.22–5.51), P = 0.8) (Fig. 1).Figure 1Multivariate analysis of various parameters related to disease severity and their association with death. For each viral infection, the odds ratios (OR) for each parameter and 95% confidence intervals (CI) are plotted.Full size imageLast, we calculated the percentage of deaths with respect to the presence or absence of secondary bacterial infections in the COVID-19 and Influenza groups (Fig. 2). Bacterial infections resulted in significantly decreased survival rates in both groups. While 13.2% of patients without infections died, 33% of patients with one infection and 61% of patients with two or more infections died (Chi-Square Test, no infections p < 0.001, one infection p = 0.001, more than one p = 0.002).Figure 2Association of coinfection variables with disease outcome. Stacked graphs are presenting the percentage of surviving or non-surviving coinfected patients in both groups. The top graphs compare survival rates in each group according to the time of infection, while the lower graphs compare the survival rates according to the number of infections. Chi-Square Test was used to compare the categorical variables, ***, p < 0.001.Full size imageComparison between the influenza and COVID-19 groups showed that patients infected with COVID-19 have a higher risk of death. In the influenza group 17.6% of patients with one infection, and 25% of the patients with more than one infection died. While in the COVID-19 group, 48.1% of patients in the group with one infection, and 75.9% of patients with more than one infection died (Chi-Square Test, influenza p < 0.001, COVID-19 p < 0.001). A similar analysis was performed regarding the time of the infection in both COVID-19 and influenza groups. In the group of patients without bacterial infection 13.2% of the patients died while 27.7% of patients with early infection and 51.9% of patients with late infections died (Chi-Square Test, no infection p < 0.001, early p < 0.001, late p < 0.001). Comparison between the influenza and COVID-19 groups indicated that late infections in COVID-19 patients resulted in higher death rates. In the influenza group, 5.9% of patients with no infection died. The death rates were 16.2% and 23.1% among patients with early or late infections, respectively. Among COVID-19 patients, 21.7% of patients died in the group with no bacterial infection. The death rates were 42.9% and 66% among patients with early or late infections (Chi-Square Test, influenza p < 0.001, COVID-19 p < 0.001).DiscussionIn this study, we compared two large cohorts of influenza, and COVID-19 patients admitted to a large tertiary center and from which bacterial cultures from blood, sputum, and/or BAL were obtained. Most secondary bacterial infections in both groups were derived from blood cultures. Patients infected with these viruses suffer from acute respiratory distress; therefore, clinicians mostly avoid taking sputum and BAL tests. This might affect the number of infections identified in blood cultures vs. cultures from respiratory origins. However, it should be also taken into account that respiratory infections might become systemic with time as well. In general, COVID-19 patients were more severely ill, as reflected by various disease severity markers, and had worse outcomes, reflected by a higher percentage of intubation or death than influenza patients. Importantly, COVID-19 patients had more documented secondary bacterial infections than influenza patients, and these infections were independently associated with death in COVID-19 but not in influenza patients.These findings suggest that secondary bacterial infections might be a significant, potentially treatable, contributing factor for disease severity among COVID-19 patients.Our results are in line with previous studies reporting that COVID-19 patients suffer from a more severe disease and ~ 3 times higher death rates) than influenza patients. In addition, in-hospital death of patients with pulmonary secondary bacterial infection was two-times higher in COVID-19 patients8.In this study, the most common bacterial infections in patients with either influenza or COVID-19 were Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, generally in agreement with previous studies8. Staphylococcus aureus is a known pathogen associated with secondary pneumonia during influenza infection9. Its dissemination to the lungs is attributed to a combination of environmental changes and immune responses that create suitable conditions for Staphylococcus aureus infection9. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is also associated with chronic predisposing respiratory conditions, including upper respiratory tract infections such as influenza10,11. While Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common respiratory opportunistic pathogen, it is also known as the most common gram-negative bacterial species associated with severe hospital-acquired infections in some hospitals12.Interestingly, a significant difference was observed in the percentage of Enterococcus infections between influenza and COVID-19 (0% vs. 8.6%, p = 0.018). Furthermore, late infections with gram-positive bacteria were more common in COVID-19 compared to influenza patients. Of note, a large multi-center study from Sweden comparing bacterial growth in 15,103 blood cultures from COVID-19 patients with non-infected controls also found that the rate of infections with gram-positive bacteria was significantly higher in patients with COVID-19 (66% vs. 50%, p < 0.0001)13.Generally, the overall time from admission to bacterial growth was longer for COVID-19 compared to influenza patients. This possibly reflects the disease's natural history, characterized by a late deterioration, typically 7–10 days after symptoms onset, that might be accompanied by a secondary bacterial infection. Alternatively, COVID-19 patients are admitted in isolated dedicated wards under strict isolation protocol, limiting free medical and nursing personnel access. This might affect the quality of medical treatment and increase the likelihood of complications such as nosocomial infections, including line, device-related, skin, and soft tissue infections associated with gram-positive bacteria14. This hypothesis is in line with the increased hospitalization length, the longer overall time from admission to bacterial growth, and the higher rates of late gram-positive bacterial infections observed in COVID-19 than influenza patients. In addition, the higher fraction of late gram-positive infections isolated from blood cultures in COVID-19 compared to influenza, further supports this notion.Although several studies characterized the secondary bacterial infections in COVID-19 patients, our study is the first to compare the infecting bacterial pathogens with those observed in influenza patients from the same center, and to correlate secondary bacterial infections in both groups with disease severity and outcome.Our study, however, has several limitations. First, it is retrospective in nature and relies on proper documentation of cultures and clinical parameters in the medical records. The study might also suffer from selection bias since the decision to obtain bacterial cultures was done by the treating clinician and most probably was affected by the severity of the disease. Second, given the local screening policy of every admitted patient for COVID-19 during the pandemic, we also cannot rule out that a fraction of patients (especially among the COVID-19 group) was hospitalized due to other medical conditions implicated in bacteremia that were completely unrelated to their viral infection. Furthermore, since there were no influenza cases in Israel during the COVID-19 pandemic, the two groups of patients might reflect different time periods. Last, the study's data was from a single center, and thus the infecting bacteria might reflect a site-specific microbiological profile.Taken together, our results show that secondary bacterial infections, in particular late gram-positive infections, are a clinically important complication with a significant correlation to poor outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. This calls for increased awareness of the treating physicians to the possibility of secondary bacterial infection as an etiology to late deterioration, suggesting that antibiotic treatment may be an essential component of the therapeutic armamentarium in selected patients with severe COVID-19. As gram-positive bacteria are increasingly becoming resistant to antibiotics15, our results highlight the importance of implementing infection control measures specific for COVID-19 hospitalized patients in addition to modification of antibiotic treatment protocols.MethodsStudy design, data collection, and outcomesInfluenza and COVID-19 patients admitted to Rabin Medical Center, a large tertiary center in Israel, between October 2018 to February 2021 were selected for the study. Viral infection was confirmed using a specific RT-PCR assay performed on nasopharyngeal and throat swabs (COPAN Diagnostics Inc.). SARS-CoV RT-PCR was performed using the Allplex™ 2019-nCoV Assay (Seegene). Influenza detection was performed using Xpert®Xpress Flu/RSV (Cepheid) or the Allplex™ Respiratory Panel 1 (Seegene). A total of 2146 admitted patients diagnosed with Influenza (n = 923) or COVID-19 (n = 1223) were identified according to their medical files. The need for informed consent was waived due to the retrospective nature of the study. Only patients for whom blood and/or sputum/bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cultures were taken upon admission or during hospitalization were included in the study. After excluding the patients for which no culture was taken, 742 influenza and 642 COVID-19 patients were selected for further analysis.Blood or sputum cultures were taken routinely at admission or according to the discretion of the treating clinician. The samples were transferred to the microbiology laboratory and processed according to the current standard practice procedures16. Sputum or BAL specimens were cultured, some of the samples were also tested using BIOFIRE® FILMARRAY® Pneumonia plus Panel according to the discretion of the treating clinician. Blood cultures were analyzed using the BACTEC™ blood culture system /BACTEC™ FX system (Becton Dickinson, Inc). Positive cultures were further analyzed according to the current standard practice procedures16. Identification of isolates was performed using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization–time-of-flight mass spectrometry. GeneXpert assay was performed directly on positive blood cultures suspected of containing staphylococci after the gram staining.Bacterial growth during the first 48 h from admission was regarded as early or coinfection, and bacterial growth up to 2 weeks from admission was defined as a late infection. The study was approved by Rabin Medical Center Review Board (#RMC-20–0142) and the Tel Aviv University Ethics Committee (0001269–3) and was performed according to the Helsinki declaration.Statistical analysisThe patient’s cohort was divided into two groups based on the viral infection diagnosis (influenza and SARS-CoV-2). Normality tests were conducted for all variables. Due to the non-normal distribution of our variables, we used the non-parametric Wilcoxon and Kruskal Wallis tests when appropriate, and median and interquartile range (IQR) are presented. Chi-square or Fisher’s exact tests were used to compare categorical variables between study groups accordingly, p < 0.05 (two-tailed test) was considered statistically significant. Univariate and multivariate regression models were constructed to estimate predictors for the primary outcome. ORs with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Logistic regression was used to calculate ORs. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 25, R 4.04, and GraphPad PRISM 8. ReferencesMorris, D. E., Cleary, D. W. & Clarke, S. C.

Advanced Search Home News Releases Multimedia Meetings Login Register News Release 16-Jun-2021 Stem cells may hold a key to developing new vaccines against COVID-19 Coronavirus activates a stem cell-mediated defense mechanism that reactivates dormant TB in a mouse model and has implications for developing new vaccines and avoiding a global TB pandemic, report investigators in The American Journal of Pathology Peer-Reviewed Publication Elsevier image: Schematic representation of the putative altruistic defense of stem cell niche against murine hepatitis virus-1 (MHV-1) infection in dormant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (dMtb) harboring mice. The viral infection induces enhanced stemness or altruistic stem cell (ASC) reprogramming of lung mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which then expands and secretes yet unknown secretory products/vesicles/antimicrobial peptides to enhance the group fitness of the type II alveolar cells present in the alveolar stem cell niche. The proliferating ASCs then undergo spontaneous apoptosis/differentiation by activating p53 upstream genes involved in apoptosis, thus sacrificing self-fitness, similar to embryonic stem cell-derived ASCs. The dMtb exploits this ASC-based stem cell niche defense for the reactivation of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). HIF, hypoxia-inducible factor. view more Credit: The American Journal of Pathology Philadelphia, June 16, 2021 - The SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 may have the ability to reactivate dormant tuberculosis (TB). In a novel study scientists report in The American Journal of Pathology that infection with a specific coronavirus strain reactivated dormant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) in mice. This knowledge may help to develop new vaccines for COVID-19 and avoid a potential global tuberculosis epidemic. The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus demonstrates the ability of an emerging virus to affect masses and strain and disrupt the workings of modern healthcare systems around the world. A significant number of infected COVID-19 individuals have recovered. However, a possible host defense or antiviral mechanism against the virus is yet to be identified. There are concerns that in the long-term, the virus might activate dormant bacterial infections such as TB in select infected individuals, as alarmingly, TB is already present in one quarter of the world population. Viral infections such as the influenza virus or SARS-CoV-1 are known to cause transient immune suppression that leads to reactivation of dormant bacterial infection. The highest death rate during the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918 was in patients with TB, and patients with TB or multidrug-resistant TB had a worse prognosis than others during the influenza A (H1N1) pandemic in 2009. "There is an urgent need to study the association of COVID-19 with dormant TB reactivation to avoid a potential global TB pandemic," explained lead investigator Bikul Das, MD, PhD, Department of Stem Cell and Infectious Diseases, KaviKrishna Laboratory, Guwahati Biotech Park, Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati, India; and Department of Stem Cell and Infection, Thoreau Lab for Global Health, University of Massachusetts, Lowell, MA, USA. "It is important to understand the host defense mechanism against this disease to develop a better vaccine and/or treatment. We therefore postulated that, similar to bacteria, adult stem cells may also exhibit an altruistic defense mechanism to protect their niche against external threat." Investigators studied the coronavirus strain murine hepatitis virus-1 (MHV-1) infection in the lung in a mouse model (dMtb) of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-mediated MTB dormancy. This showed 20-fold lower viral loads than the dMtb-free control mice by the third week of viral infection and a six-fold increase of altruistic stem cells (ASCs), thereby enhancing the defense. Tuberculosis was reactivated in the dMtb mice, suggesting that dormant TB bacteria hijack these ASCs to replicate in the lung to cause pulmonary TB. Results suggest that these ASCs are transient (they expand for two weeks and then undergo apoptosis or cellular suicide) and exhibit antiviral activities against MHV-1 by secreting soluble factors. "These findings are important because they reveal a novel ASC defense mechanism against mouse coronavirus infection, which could be used to develop novel therapeutic approaches against COVID-19," noted Bikul Das. "The finding of TB reactivation in a stem cell-mediated Mtb dormancy mouse model during MHV-1 coronavirus infection indicates that in the long-term, post-pandemic, the SARS-CoV-2 virus might activate dormant bacterial infections. This is a significant finding considering the current coronavirus pandemic, where many individuals in India and other developing countries with dormant TB infection may see an increase in active TB cases post COVID-19. The ASC-mediated defense mechanism may be targeted to develop vaccines against viral infections and avoid a potential global TB pandemic." ### Background notes This study of stem cell altruism was inspired by the Indian Vedantic Philosophical theory of altruistic behavior, which was referred to in the poem "Fire of Golden Nail" written by Vedic philosopher and poet Krishna Ram Das of Kamrupa, India, noted the study's authors. Poet Krishna Ram Das conceptualized the idea while undergoing surgery for throat cancer and initiated the KaviKrishna Foundation to test his idea through vigorous scientific research. "Proving altruism in mammalian cell biology is a challenging task, as we faced years of resistance from colleagues," commented Bikul Das. "Altruism is about group selection, which is very challenging to demonstrate at the molecular level. However, the idea of altruism that we are describing here is the philosophical view of Vedic Jiva Upakarvada (Vedic altruism), a part of Vedantic thought that states that during stress, the living organism acquires a higher state, known as 'Avatar.' The mandate of the KaviKrishna laboratory is to take this philosophical view forward to modern biology, specifically to develop a philosophical and social theory on global health. First author Lekhika Pathak, PhD student at the KaviKrishna Lab, GBP, IIT-Guwahati, India, commented: "I joined the laboratory hoping to further ASC research exploiting the model of MHV-1-infected stem cell-mediated Mtb dormancy. Our research findings now may provide a novel approach to understand the interaction between two pathogens, coronavirus and M. tuberculosis, both of which are major threats to global health." Co-investigator Herman Yeger, PhD, of the Department of Pediatric Laboratory Medicine, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, added: "I commend Bikul Das for being innovative in transforming a piece of Indian philosophy into a testable biological experiment on altruism. Now that we have obtained convincing data on the identification of ASC and their defense against coronavirus, we hope to develop a novel approach to tackle this growing pandemic."

Photo: STR/AFP via Getty Images I was living in Shanghai when a new avian flu virus emerged there in 2013. The outbreak started in February, shortly after the Lunar New Year, when an 87-year-old man and his two sons showed up at a local hospital with a fever and other symptoms. By early March, the elderly man was dead, leading an anonymous Chinese social media user to speculate about the strange circumstances surrounding his demise. Censors swiftly deleted the post. Shanghai officials initially said that the man had died from routine complications, but by the end of the month, the government’s claims had given way to a troubling admission: The Chinese health ministry notified the World Health Organization of the emergence of a new avian flu virus called H7N9. The death toll rose to seven, and cases spread to provinces surrounding Shanghai. Public health experts lost sleep worrying that the world was on the brink of a pandemic. Join Our Newsletter Original reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. I'm in H7N9 would turn out to be a minor threat compared to SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes Covid-19, but the path it took will sound familiar to anyone who has tracked the news over the last year. Initial cases in China were followed by censorship and secrecy, which gave way to lingering suspicion of both the government and Chinese scientists. I remember that trajectory vividly because I was the lead China correspondent for the journal Science during the H7N9 outbreak. Many times over the past year, amid seesawing and often misleading media coverage of the search for the origins of SARS-CoV-2, I have thought back on one particular story I wrote in 2013. I profiled a flu researcher who was helping authorities contain the spread of H7N9. Even as she became the point person for the outbreak, she was at the center of a scientific controversy for an experiment she had done on another avian flu virus. That work involved tweaking pathogens in order to study how they might become more contagious, a type of study that is often lumped under the shorthand “gain of function.” Proponents of such experiments argued that a better understanding of how viruses are transmitted from one species to the next could help public health experts ward off natural outbreaks. Critics worried that instead of aiding in global health, her research could spark a pandemic. Republicans believed a few vocal politicians who claimed, wrongly, that the pandemic was definitely caused by a lab leak, and Democrats believed a few vocal scientists who assured them, also wrongly, that it was definitely impossible. That was before gain-of-function work got stirred into the toxic stew that is American politics, before it was mixed up with feelings about former President Donald Trump and ex-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, racism and anti-racism, and faith in science. Before Republicans believed a few vocal politicians who claimed, wrongly, that the pandemic was definitely caused by a lab leak, and Democrats believed a few vocal scientists who assured them, also wrongly, that such a thing was definitely impossible. To be sure, gain-of-function research was political even back in 2013, but only within the scientific community. (The broad label “gain of function” can apply to less risky research, but critics are concerned mainly with research that involves making pathogens more transmissible in a way that might pose a risk to humans.) Understanding that debate is key to grasping how and why the mainstream media has charted such an abrupt shift, from branding speculation about a lab leak a conspiracy theory to enthusiastically, and prematurely, embracing it. When the first rumors about a new virus trickled out on Chinese social media back in 2013, I was at home with a newborn. I came back from maternity leave early to cover the new strain and soon flew to Harbin, a city in northeastern China, to interview the country’s leading avian flu expert, Chen Hualan. Because my baby was so little, I brought her and my partner along. As the head of Harbin Veterinary Research Institute’s National Avian Influenza Reference Laboratory, Chen oversaw animal testing efforts for H7N9. Like many viruses before it, including Ebola, MERS, and the first SARS, H7N9 jumped naturally from animals to people. So-called natural spillovers often happen in densely populated areas where people live close to animals. (That frequency is one reason many scientists suspect a natural origin with SARS-CoV-2.) With H7N9, the likely culprit was poultry markets. I wanted to talk with Chen about the early days of the outbreak, when her lab had scrambled to sequence and analyze H7N9 strains isolated from chickens and pigeons. But I also wanted to ask about her other research. Shortly before my trip, she and her colleagues had published a paper in Science detailing a massive gain-of-function experiment with guinea pigs. It had involved swapping gene segments from H5N1 with those from the H1N1 swine virus, then infecting guinea pigs with the hybrid viruses. Her team found that they could get the virus to leap from one animal to another by switching out a single gene. The guinea pigs stood in for humans. Even as China was in the midst of an outbreak with a clearly natural origin, critics worried that risky research on pathogens could give rise to a worse one. But that was eight years ago, before the discourse on such research had geopolitical implications. Arriving in Harbin, we checked into a neoclassical-style hotel overlooking Stalin Park. My partner and baby stayed there while I taxied over to the avian flu lab, which at the time was housed in a sprawling complex built before the 1949 Chinese Communist Revolution. A northerly outpost that lags behind China’s more developed cities, Harbin is not a logical place for a lab where scientists work on highly dangerous pathogens, but in China, as elsewhere in the world, decisions about where to locate such labs are not always driven by biosafety concerns. In this case, Harbin had become a research hub through a mixture of chance and mission creep. Northeast China is a traditional agricultural region with a lot of livestock. Decades earlier, farmers’ needs had turned Harbin into a center of veterinary research. In time, veterinary science gave way to a lab focused on animals that was classified as biosafety level P3, or BSL-3. In 2018, the Harbin Veterinary Research Institute moved to a new campus with a BSL-4 laboratory, the highest biosafety level. (The other BSL-4 lab in China is at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, the institute at the center of the SARS-CoV-2 lab-leak hypothesis.)

She showed me around the parts of the building that didn’t require a gown and other protective equipment and asked about my baby. She told me that when she had started her research in the 1990s, virologists in China had trouble even obtaining strains to work on. After solving that problem, they faced other challenges. “When they got a virus, they just put it in the freezer,” she said of scientists in China in the early aughts. “People didn’t know how to do research with viruses. They may not be happy to hear me say it, but it’s true.” Chen left for the United States to do postdoctoral work at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, under renowned flu scientist Kanta Subbarao. Three years later, she was offered a position back in China heading up the lab in Harbin. Chen sensed that research conditions were changing and the country would become an exciting place for flu research. Over the decades that followed, her hunch was borne out. China became a site of cutting-edge experiments and large grant budgets. Researchers worked closely with scientists elsewhere in the world and published their findings in top journals. For infectious disease surveillance, which requires a global network tracking emerging outbreaks, that collaboration was critical. But as the international profile of Chinese science rose, it was beset by the controversies that plagued science elsewhere in the world. As the international profile of Chinese science rose, it was beset by the controversies that plagued science elsewhere in the world. Chen’s paper on H5N1 and guinea pigs was published in May 2013, when H7N9 was still spreading through southern China. More than a dozen researchers had worked on the study, which involved 250 guinea pigs, 1,000 mice, and 27,000 infected chicken eggs. Their goal was to determine what changes would enable the H5N1 virus to spread more effectively. After swapping out the single gene, they found that an infected animal could pass the virus to a healthy one in an adjoining cage through respiratory droplets. A firestorm ensued. In comments that were splashed across the pages of the Daily Mail, former U.K. Royal Society President Lord Robert May called the study “appallingly irresponsible.” Criticism came from within China, too. When the paper was published, “scientists in China were pretty shocked,” Liu Wenjun, deputy director of the Chinese Academy of Sciences’ Key Laboratory of Pathogenic Microbiology & Immunology, told me at the time. “This artificial virus could cause a big problem in China. People are really concerned about biosecurity.” Chen said that all of her research had been above-board and that following the outcry, China’s Ministry of Agriculture had sent two people to the lab to make sure that its viruses were properly stored. Her team had also developed impressive vaccines against avian illnesses. She felt that the criticism was off-base, she said, and added that May, a theoretical ecologist, didn’t understand her work. Virologists who did similar research had a completely different take on Chen’s work. I spoke with five of them. One quibbled with the design of the experiment, but the others used words like “exemplary” and “highly respected.” Ron Fouchier of Erasmus MC in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, told me that he had dreamed of doing exactly the same experiment as Chen but couldn’t because of various constraints. “I do not have a single grant for which I could afford to work with 13 people for two years to yield a paper, no matter how excellent that paper is,” he wrote in an email. Yoshihiro Kawaoka of the University of Wisconsin-Madison also spoke highly of Chen and told me that her lab was state of the art. But Fouchier and Kawaoka were not entirely neutral on the topic. They had come under fire for similar experiments. Studies they had done involving a potentially airborne version of H5N1 had sparked a global outcry in 2011, when news of the experiments leaked before they published their results. In 2014, studies including Chen’s, Fouchier’s, and Kawaoka’s would prompt critics to form the Cambridge Working Group, which called for halting research on pathogens that could cause a pandemic pending a thorough review. The Cambridge group’s work spurred the U.S. National Institutes of Health to impose a moratorium on certain types of gain-of-function research that same year. Three years later, the NIH lifted the ban and replaced it with a more lenient framework. Back then, there was a sense that virologists could not police themselves, that their work needed to be regulated. But for portions of the political left in the wake of the pandemic, that notion has become heretical. Until recently, the suggestion that a virus could leak from a lab had no correlation with one’s political beliefs. The first SARS virus leaked from labs several times — including at least twice from the National Institute of Virology in Beijing. A 1977 outbreak of H1N1 in the Soviet Union and China is believed to have been caused by Soviet scientists experimenting with a live virus in a lab. A number of leading American laboratories have had significant safety breaches as well, including at the CDC. Before the pandemic, the scientific press regularly covered such risks. In a 2017 article on the opening of the Wuhan Institute of Virology, Nature raised concerns about biosafety. The notion of a lab leak was also floated by Science early in the Covid-19 pandemic in an article that also discussed a natural spillover. Read Our Complete Coverage The Coronavirus Crisis Then influential infectious disease expert and zoologist Peter Daszak entered the fray. Daszak’s organization EcoHealth Alliance has distributed U.S. government grant money to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, and he has worked closely with researchers there. He organized a group of scientists to write a statement, published in The Lancet in February 2020, decrying the spread of “rumors and misinformation” around the origins of the pandemic. “We stand together to strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin,” the group wrote. In apparently dismissing the plausible prospect of a lab accident along with outlandish propositions about bioweapons, the letter helped silence debate on the matter. The discourse grew even more fraught later that spring, when Trump blamed the pandemic on the Wuhan lab without citing evidence. Some journalists apparently saw it as their duty to uncritically report what researchers said, as if scientists were a neutral foil to Trump. In the coverage that followed, some journalists apparently saw it as their duty to uncritically report what researchers said, as if scientists were a neutral foil to Trump. Vox extensively quoted Daszak in an explainer debunking the lab-leak hypothesis. Daszak ended up on both the WHO and Lancet origins committees, which are investigating the causes of the coronavirus pandemic. He chairs The Lancet’s committee. Last fall Jamie Metzl, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council who sits on the WHO’s advisory committee on human genome editing, wrote to Lancet editor Richard Horton to flag Daszak’s conflict of interest. He added that he respected Daszak’s work, writing, “I am not at all suggesting that he did anything wrong, just that one of the possible origin stories includes him.” Metzl says that the Lancet editor didn’t write back. “I was a bit naïve then and couldn’t imagine they would knowingly make such a bad decision,” he told me. As Metzl noted, a conflict of interest doesn’t in any way suggest guilt. But Daszak’s ties fueled online suspicion and frustrated biosafety experts who were hoping for real answers. Members of the World Health Organization team investigating the origins of Covid-19 arrive at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in Wuhan, China, on Feb. 3, 2021. Photo: Hector Retamal/AFP via Getty Images Following the WHO committee’s trip to China, Metzl helped lead a group of scientists who wrote an open letter calling for a more extensive investigation into the origins of SARS-CoV-2. They followed up with another one after the committee concluded, following a circumscribed tour of Wuhan and an analysis of selective data, that a lab leak was “extremely unlikely.” A number of the signatories of both letters were French scientists. Jacques van Helden, a professor of bioinformatics at Aix-Marseille Université, told me that the discussion around the pandemic’s origins has been less polarized in France, noting that Trump had tainted the issue in the United States. “I suspect that this might even have led a part of the American scientific community to avoid addressing the question,” he said, “because expressing the possibility that the virus would result from a lab leak would have been perceived as support for Trump.” Another open letter calling for a transparent and objective investigation followed, this time from a group of leading experts. Among those who signed were evolutionary biologist Jesse Bloom of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Stanford University microbiologist David Relman, and Harvard University epidemiologist and microbiologist Marc Lipsitch, who years earlier had founded the Cambridge group that pushed for restrictions on gain-of-function research. Even WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has said that the lab-leak hypothesis “requires further investigation.” Vox added a note to its explainer noting that “scientific consensus has shifted.” But the moment of correction we’re now in is dangerous in its own way. There is still no direct evidence to support a lab leak, and many scientists with no stake in the outcome still say that a natural origin is more likely. Scientific consensus has not, in fact, shifted toward a lab origin. But some pundits with the risky combination of a lack of expertise and an agenda have argued that a lab leak caused the pandemic, case closed. Bari Weiss, the former New York Times columnist who spends most of her time railing against cancel culture, recently published an interview with Mike Pompeo, who told her that the evidence “points in the single direction of this having been a laboratory leak,” though he added, “I can’t lay down the proof for you.” The most honest experts say simply that they don’t know. “We’re not taking an advocacy position on one scenario being more likely than another,” Bloom, the evolutionary biologist, said in a Q&A published by his institute. “As a scientist it’s important to clearly convey that there is scientific uncertainty — especially because this is a hot-button topic.” Read Our Complete Coverage Origins of Covid There is vitriol on all sides. Alina Chan, a molecular biologist at the Broad Institute who advocates for a fuller investigation of the lab-leak hypothesis, has been accused of being a race traitor. (Chan is Canadian and of Singaporean descent.) Virologist Angela Rasmussen, a vocal proponent of a natural origin, has been viciously harassed on Twitter. The Daily Mail recently sent paparazzi to Daszak’s home, then ran photos of him calling the police. Scientists in China have been hounded too. The Harbin Veterinary Research Institute and the Wuhan Institute of Virology have removed some staff information from their websites. A few weeks ago, I received hate mail from someone who was upset that I had mentioned the lab-leak hypothesis in an article about origins last spring, when it was all but untouchable for progressive media, but didn’t give Trump proper credit. We should let science and evidence prevail while recognizing what my reporting suggested back in 2013: that science, like any other discipline, is shaped by competing interests. Lipsitch, the Harvard epidemiologist, underlined that point in a Brookings Institution event with Chan earlier this month. “I’ve come to the view that we shouldn’t trust scientists more or less than we trust other people,” Lipsitch said at the event. “We should trust science. And when scientists speak science, we should trust them, because we should recognize that they are speaking in a way that is based on evidence. When scientists express political views or policy preferences or even claims about how the world is that are not citing evidence, we should not give those scientists undue deference.” In those moments, he continued, scientists are not being scientific. “They are people. We are people.” Share Copy link Share on Facebook Share on X Share on LinkedIn Share on WhatsApp Contact the author: Mara Hvistendahl mara.hvistendahl@theintercept.com @MaraHvistendahl on X Related The Vaccine Divide Big Pharma’s Deadly Covid-19 Vaccine Monopoly Brazil Seeks to Hold Bolsonaro Accountable for More Than 400,000 Covid-19 Deaths In Its Zeal to Blame China for Coronavirus, the Trump Administration Is Thwarting Investigations Into the Pandemic’s Origins Latest Stories Congress Is About to Gift Trump Sweeping Powers to Crush His Political Enemies Noah Hurowitz - Nov. 10 The House is set to vote Tuesday on a bill that would let the administration destroy nonprofits it claims support terrorism.

The recommendations also highlighted an unmet need for research on how dupilumab influences the effectiveness of cellular and humoral immune responses to different types of vaccines.AD affects young children and most patients’ disease presents before they turn 5 years old. The CDC and the Public Health Agency of Canada encourage physicians to dole out vaccinations for immunocompromised patients on a case-by-case basis to avoid infections that could be prevented with vaccines.In the United States and Europe, dupilumab is the only biologic therapy approved for use in children as young as 6 years of age with severe AD and is often prescribed off-label for younger children, which has raised concerns on how to immunize pediatric patients on dupilumab safely.A literature review published in February 2020 evaluated studies that tried to answer whether vaccinations were safe for children with AD taking dupilumab. An expert panel consisting of 5 health care professionals working in dermatology, immunology, infectious diseases, and vaccinations held a consensus meeting to discuss the identified literature and develop and vote on recommendations.For the statements to be included in the publication, at least 75% of the panel had to agree on including them. In the end, all 7 recommendations received 100% consensus. Those statements included:Dupilumab does not appear to affect the development of antibodies titers to inactivated vaccines.Dupilumab therapy does not need to be interrupted for administration of inactivated vaccines.Seasonal inactivated influenza vaccination should continue for dupilumab-treated patients.Live attenuated vaccines should be avoided while on dupilumab but could be considered on a case-by case-basis.When live attenuated vaccines are required, they should be administered at least 4 weeks prior to starting dupilumab treatment and could be considered on a case-by-case basis.Measuring specific antibody levels can be considered to ensure serologic protection after receiving a vaccine while on dupilumab therapy.There is no evidence to suggest that immunization while on dupilumab causes AD exacerbations.Seasonal influenza vaccinations are recommended in pediatric patients treated with dupilumab because of the complications that can stem from influenza infection. However, the panel noted that the type of seasonal flu vaccine is region-specific, meaning that immune responses and efficacy could vary in dupilumab-treated individuals.Despite having access to some research for the effects of inactivated vaccines in dupilumab-treated patients, the panel said that there is insufficient data on the safety and efficacy of live attenuated vaccines, such as vaccines for measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella, in patients on dupilumab therapy.The panel suggested that providers should weigh the risks of infection with the risks posed by live attenuated vaccines in dupilumab-treated vaccinations.“In the absence of an evidence base to guide clinical decision making, our consensus discussions and statements are a starting point/food for thought for clinicians struggling with these decisions,” wrote the investigators.In situations where a live attenuated vaccine is necessary, such as for patients who live in an area experiencing a measles outbreak, the panel recommended that providers should consult a clinical immunologist and an infectious disease specialist. Additionally, providers should make the parents or guardians of these patients aware of potential risks associated with vaccinations and the dangers of infection.Generally, the panel said that patients with AD should be vaccinated in accordance with national vaccination plans but should not receive a vaccination if experiencing an acute AD flare.“In the scenario of an acute AD flare, starting treatment to achieve disease control should be prioritized over vaccination. Good clinical AD control for 2 weeks before receiving vaccinations is optimal to avoid skin complications related to vaccination,” wrote the panel.The panel noted several limitations, including the small number of panelists, the lack of evidence on vaccine response in pediatric patients with AD on immunosuppressive treatments, that existing international guidelines are based on moderate to low levels of evidence, and that the review took place before the COVID-19 vaccines became available.ReferenceMartinez-Cabriales SA, Kirchhof MG, Constantinescu CM, Murguia-Favela L, Ramien ML.

Request Media Kit Login More Health June 18, 2021 Probiotics can make flu vaccine more effective A collection of scientific studies has revealed the important role two specific strains of probiotics play in improving the effectiveness and longevity of the flu vaccine. According to researchers, an extensive range of clinical trials show that probiotics can increase antibody levels (to protect against the flu virus) by 13-20%1. The collection of scientific data indicate that a course of probiotics taken from the day of flu vaccination and containing the strains LGG (20 billion) and BB-12 can result in a significant increase in flu virus protection.1,2 In these studies, 84% of LGG subjects achieved protective antibody levels versus 55% of placebo subjects.2 With peak flu season around the corner, the findings are particularly timely and follow the Australian Influenza Surveillance Report, which showed that just 30-60 per cent of flu vaccine recipients make adequate antibodies to protect themselves against the virus.3 This follows other recent studies which conclude that flu vaccine protection can vanish in as little as 90 days leaving patients once again at risk.4 To further complicate matters, microbiome destruction by antibiotics has also been shown to reduce immune responses to the flu vaccine.5 In Australia there are 40 million antibiotic scripts filled each year, with most patients taking multiple courses annually. Therefore, there’s a real risk that their immune response to vaccination may be inadequate. Probiotics: working hand-in-hand with the flu vaccine to enhance immunity According to Nathan Rose, Metagenics Head of Science, the reason certain probiotics make the flu vaccine stronger and last longer is due to the microbiota-immune interaction, which is essential for effective antibody development.6 “Antibodies to the flu vaccine are produced when the body’s Toll Like Receptor (TRL)-5 is signalled, however the vaccine itself doesn’t stimulate TRL-5. Rather, that process is part of the body’s natural immune response and requires the help of the intestinal microbial flagella, which is where probiotics come in4,” he says. Mr Rose adds that the probiotic strains LGG and BB-12 both have an impact on the microbial flagella, which signal the TRL-5 to produce antibodies such as lgG and lgA in response to a vaccine or viral pathogen. “And this process is what enables the immune system to build a plan of attack and remember what to do next time it comes into contact with the virus,” he adds. What this means for Australians this flu season 2020 saw a record 18 million flu vaccines administered in Australia, up from 13.2 million in 2019, a positive trend which health experts expect to see again this flu season – as consumers take all measures to protect themselves against ill-health and Covid-19. However, at a time where consumer vaccine literacy has never been higher, health experts are calling for greater discussion around flu vaccine efficacy, so that Australians are educated and informed on what they could be doing to improve its effectiveness and heighten their own health. “There is no question that the flu vaccine helps to protect and save the lives of Australians young and old and is especially important in this era of Covid-19,” says Dr Michela Sorensen, General Practitioner and one of Australia’s leading medical educators. “However, what many people don’t know is that the effectiveness of the flu vaccine changes yearly and typically sits between around 40-50%. “While it does reduce the risk of contracting the flu, there’s also a large number of people who don’t make enough antibodies to protect themselves from the flu and it also only protects for a limited period of time. “But this promising new body of research shows that there are simple things everyday Australians can do to boost the effectiveness of the flu jab and to better protect themselves against the debilitating, seasonal virus. “When getting the flu vaccine, I would encourage all Australians to speak with their healthcare professional about how to improve its effectiveness and in particular, enquire about a treatment course of probiotics that specifically contain the strains LGG and BB-12,” she adds. “The great news is, that this presents such a simple and attainable measure to boosting flu vaccine effectiveness that is fully supported by science,” she says. Dr Sorenson adds that consumers do need to be aware that not all probiotics are made equal and that they do need to look for those that contain the strains LGG and BB-12.

We suggest that valuable evidence can be gleaned from the “Spanish” flu of 1918–20. It is well-known that the world fell into a protectionist spiral following the First World War, but scholars have almost exclusively ignored the impact of the pandemic. We employ a difference-in-differences strategy and find that the flu had a significant impact on trade policy, independent of the war. In our preferred specification, a one standard deviation increase in excess deaths during the outbreak implied 0.022 percentage points higher tariffs subsequently, corresponding to an increase of one third of a standard deviation in tariffs. Health policy should aim to avoid the experience of the interwar period and consider the international macroeconomic impact of measures (not) taken.

Might countries turn more inwards following loss of life during the Covid-19 pandemic? There has been much speculation about how the post-coronavirus world will look. For example, Foreign Policy wrote that “the coronavirus is killing globalization as we know it”, and that “the outbreak has been a gift to nativist nationalists and protectionists, and it is likely to have a long-term impact on the free movement of people and goods” (Legrain, 2020). In a similar vein, an article in the New York Times stated that the coronavirus has come at a time “when the world was already turning inward, largely in reaction to the global financial crisis of 2008. Nations have been erecting barriers to the free flow of people, money and goods”.Footnote 1 Only history can give us any guidance, and the latter article points out in passing that the Spanish flu perhaps simply “accelerated trends that were already underway”. We quantify the impact of the severity of the impact of the pandemic on openness, and trade policy in particular, after the First World War, and find that countries hardest hit had more restrictive trade policies during the 1920s, even when controlling for participation in the war.Footnote 2Economists have long known that the First World War led to a definitive break with the globalization of the late-nineteenth century (see for example, O’Rourke and Williamson, 1999), and John Maynard Keynes’ famous passage about the end of “an extraordinary episode in the economic progress of man”,Footnote 3 reminiscing just after the First World War about the lost world of internationalization that had gone before, has often been used to illustrate this (see e.g., Harley, 2020). Thus, the war itself has often been considered to mark the division between the “first era of globalization” and the relative isolationism that was to follow. However, no one today could ignore the fact that Keynes was writing during a major pandemic, the so-called “Spanish” flu, which hit the world in several waves between 1918 and 1920. We employ a difference-in-differences strategy, finding that countries more affected saw increased trade protection subsequently. This is independent of the similarly positive effect of participating in the First World War, and a flexible specification reveals that countries were on parallel trends prior to the pandemic, but diverged subsequently, with the impact lasting throughout the 1920s until the onset of the Great Depression in 1929.The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. The following section provides a brief overview of the historical background to our analysis and provides primary historical evidence on the link between the Spanish flu and trade policy using evidence from the case of the United States in the run up to the passage of the infamous Fordney-McCumber tariff of September 21, 1922. Section “Data” presents our data, section “Empirical strategy” presents our empirical strategy, and section “Results” gives our results. Section “Conclusion” concludes.Historical backgroundSince the shocks of the First World War and the pandemic overlapped, both events are discussed here. Figure 1 provides, in a flow-chart, a visualization of the effects and mechanisms we discuss below. Here, we make a distinction between proximate and ultimate causes of governments’ trade policies. We propose (and test below in a reduced form specification) that there were two ultimate causes of the increases in tariffs observed in the 1920s: the Spanish flu and the First World War. Both impacted directly on the economy, which might have promoted revenue-raising and/or protective tariffs. They might also both have increased suspicion of foreigners, making protectionist policies more attractive. Finally, the war is also considered to have played an important role for the extension of the franchise to women in many countries, and to the extent that this might have impacted on the preferences of the electorate, we have also included this mechanism.Fig. 1: Flowchart of the suggested mechanisms.Overview of the suggested mechanisms between the First World War, the Spanish Flu, and tariffs; see text for details.Full size imageStarting with the war, this had manifold impacts on the World Economy, as systematically summarized by Broadberry and Harrison (2005), Findlay and O’Rourke (2007), and Feinstein et al (2008). The most direct were that it killed people, destroyed infrastructure and dramatically increased government spending, most of which went into the “unproductive” war effort. In addition, front lines, destroyed and requisitioned infrastructure, naval blockades and naval warfare severely disrupted international trade, directly and by disproportionately increasing insecurity and corresponding trade costs such as insurance. Workers and resources were drawn from civil production into the war itself and the production and provision of war materials. In the medium run, this created problems for government finance and economic reconversion after the war. Wounded and traumatized soldiers needed to return to civilian life. An international oversupply of heavy industry and basic foodstuffs created domestic need for adjustment, and lobby groups campaigned for at least temporary protection after the heroic effort. As noted above, franchise extensions were another consequence of the collective efforts, as was the increased importance of parties representing workers’ interests (see for example Przeworski, 2009). Women were also given the vote in most places, and de Bromhead (2018) finds that they were more likely than men to hold protectionist attitudes, and that where women were entitled to vote tariffs were, on average, higher.Footnote 4Heavily burdened government finance craved revenue, and defeated countries in particular turned to the printing press. This was accompanied by balance of payments and banking crises, also in countries such as the UK, which soon after the war opted for severe deflationist policies in order to return to the gold standard (Morys, 2014). Thousands of kilometers of new borders emerged, as the Treaty of Versailles and the breakdown of the Habsburg Empire created new states especially in Central and Eastern Europe. While many of the direct interventions in national and international markets were – except for Germany—dismantled soon after the end of the war (Feinstein et al., 2008; Hardach, 1977), the peace treaties failed to commit all parties to the third of US President Wilson’s 14 points: “the removal, as far as possible, of all economic barriers and the establishment of an equality of trade conditions among all the nations consenting to the peace and associating themselves for its maintenance.” (cited after Hardach, 1977, p. 242).Footnote 5 So, despite efforts to keep markets open through the League of Nations, many of these forces created protectionist backlashes in the 1920s (Findlay and O’Rourke, 2007), since tariff protection often served several goals, although with minor tradeoffs. Tariffs raised government revenue, aimed to correct balance of payment imbalances, helped struggling import-competitors, and provided visible input to political discourses of national reconstruction and nation-building.Some of these issues might have worked in the same direction as for our second “ultimate cause”, the Spanish flu, that—on a global level— hit regions with limited healthcare and public health capacities harder. Both shocks were related in many ways, as reflected by the arrow from the war to the flu in Fig. 1. A significant share of doctors served in the military instead of in their civilian offices and hospitals. Soldiers spread the disease, both in the military and when returning home from the war. Trade disruptions, like the Allied blockade in Europe, affected food provision and precarious nutritional status affected immune systems (Spinney, 2018). Little seems to have been written about the importance of public health interventions in Europe during the pandemic itself, but we know that, partly due to the war, far less focus was put on them there than in the US, since communication about outbreaks was far less transparent among the belligerent parties. It has been demonstrated that in the US cities that implemented earlier interventions saw lower rates of transmission (Bootsma and Ferguson, 2007; Hatchett et al., 2007).The disease thus likely created pressure on authorities to adopt means and improve access to healthcare, in a similar way to other factors which have been noted above, such as the presence of veterans, the franchise extensions to women and poorer sections of the male population, the rise of trade unions, and social unrest in general (Feinstein et al., 2008). Such means required funding and revenues. Anecdotal evidence, however, suggests that relatively few public health reactions actually occurred before the 1940s, the best documented probably being the creation of a Federal Department of Health in Canada, a country to which the pandemic spread to a significant extent through US soldiers on their way to Europe (Humphries, 2013). Also, in Weimar Germany there was a gradual shift to public healthcare, and the League of Nations featured a health institution (Spinney, 2018).On the other hand, at least in the short run, there was a marked increase in suspicion of foreigners and theories about the origin of the (assuredly not) Spanish flu during and immediately after the pandemic (Spinney, 2018). Such trends might have made ways of raising government revenue that (ostensibly) fell on foreigners, like raising tariffs, more acceptable. Highlighting a different version of the same channel, in her popular book on the 1918 influenza pandemic, Laura Spinney (2018)Footnote 6 argues that Gandhi’s anticolonial movement, which featured campaigns for a boycott of British imports and substitution by traditional Indian production (see Wolcott, 1991), received a decisive boost from the tragic outcomes of the Spanish flu in India, although Gandhi had no direct influence on India’s rising tariffs (cf. Arthi et al., 2020).So, while admittedly the literature on the macroeconomics of the Spanish flu and especially on the relationship to policy openness is virtually non-existent, it is likely that the link we uncover below worked through one of the following channels, both difficult to track in existing data: first, since reactions to pandemics are costly, they create needs for revenue, and especially at low(er) state capacity customs duties are a convenient way of raising this (Cagé and Gadenne, 2018). Second, if pandemics create a more inward-oriented public discourse, increasing tariffs becomes more tolerable.Footnote 7Ultimately, the onset of the Great Depression in 1929 was to overshadow all aspects of economic policy, and here trade policy seems to have played a significant role as a reaction to crisis.Footnote 8 Thus, de Bromhead et al. (2019) demonstrate the impact of trade policy on trade flows, showing that policy explains the majority of the UK’s shift to Imperial preference in the 1930s. Otherwise, the reasons for the far greater outbreak of protectionism in the 1930s are well known, with Eichengreen and Irwin (2010) demonstrating that exchange rate policies played a crucial role. Countries that retained fixed exchange rates under the gold standard were more susceptible to resorting to tariffs, import quotas and exchange controls. Their inability to use monetary policy led them to resort to protectionism in an ultimately futile attempt to stem the decline in their economies.In the light of the lack of previous research on the matter, and in order to provide some more concrete historical evidence for the link between the Spanish flu and subsequent trade policy beyond our empirical results below, we turn to primary sources, and specifically the case of the United States and evidence taken from Congressional debates. We examined these in the period from the end of the First World War and until the passage of the Fordney-McCumber Tariff of 1922, which represented the largest even increase in US tariffs (Irwin, 2011) and gave the US one of the highest tariffs of any creditor nation in the world, leading to some retaliation by European and Latin American countries. Besides being proposed as an internal reaction to agricultural crisis and an economic downturn resulting from monetary stabilization measures, the tariff was the result of the US’s increasingly isolationist stance following its losses during a foreign and “European” war, and was fueled by a new sense of nationalism, as well as the idea that American prosperity during the war had been due to a lack of imports and abundant exports. Its result was damage both to the domestic and the world economies (see for example Kaplan, 1996; Kaplan and Ryley, 1994; Irwin, 2017). When systematically going through the sources, beyond its immediate impact on military and other government personnel, as well as occasional calls for a more coordinated federal response, we found perhaps surprisingly few mentions of influenza or “flu” in the Congressional Record (United States. Congress, 1919–1922) reflecting the lack of attention it received by politicians at the time, as noted by others.Footnote 9 Famously, despite collapsing with the illness during peace talks at Versailles, and thus perhaps silencing his opposition to the punitive sanctions on Germany which many consider to have played a role in precipitating the Second World War (Flecknoe et al., 2018), President Woodrow Wilson never spoke openly about the illness.Footnote 10We did, however, find it mentioned in the context of debates about raising tariffs a number of times. For example, the Republican Congressman Caleb R. Layton was particularly prominent in discussions about ensuring a domestic supply of various products necessary for combatting influenza and other illnesses. Layton was a physician and served in the House of Representatives from 1918 to 1920, when he lost to the African American political activist Alice Dunbar Nelson after opposing the Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill. In 1919 he spoke during a debate on tariffs on coal-tar products, stressing his medical qualifications, and noting their use not only in dyes but also for pharmaceuticals (Cong. Rec. 58:6, p. 6006), and again in 1921, he spoke passionately during the debate on the bill (H. R. 7456—what eventually became the Fordney McCumber Tariff) “to provide revenue, to regulate commerce with foreign countries, to encourage the industries of the United States, and for other purposes.” He stated that he was “lifetime a firm believer in the policy of the protective tariff”, and again, as a doctor, he felt obliged to mention the importance of protection for coal-tar products, of which Phenacetin “was found to be of almost priceless value in the treatment of the late epidemic of influenza” (Cong. Rec. 61:4, pp. 3493–3494). Similarly passionate statements were also made by Democratic Senator James Thomas Heflin, a notorious white supremacist, in relation to a bill (S. 3390) seeking federal funding for the manufacture of nitrates, and highlighting in particular the unfortunate experience of establishing a plant in his own state of Alabama: “I wish to ask Senators whence the opposition comes that would seek to prevent America having a nitrate plant of her own? … This plant at Muscle Shoals was built under great difficulties. The influenza came just at the time these thousands of men were there at work. Many of them were stricken down and many of them died. In the hurry and the stress and strain money was wasted, doubtless; money was extravagantly spent, doubtless; but there is no getting away from the fact that that plant is located at a fine place, a very desirable place; that it is close to the phosphate beds; that it is on a fine stream of water; that it is located at one of the finest water-power sites in the wide world; and that the Government has spent eighty-odd million dollars on it; and I submit that there is no justifiable excuse for the fight that is being made to destroy this bill.” (Cong. Rec. 60:2, pp. 1309–1310). Then, in 1922, Republican Senator Joseph S. Frelinghuysen Sr. spoke in a debate regarding Senate bill 1807, “A bill to aid in stabilizing the coal industry”, noting that “During the influenza epidemic … one of the greatest elements that aided the spread of the disease was the high price of coal, which the poor families could ill afford to purchase”—and thus in favor of regulation of the industry (Cong. Rec. 62:1, p. 689). There were opposing voices, of course, and William H. King, the senior Democratic Senator for Utah (and perhaps not coincidentally the junior senator for Utah was the Republican Reed Smoot, of Smoot-Hawley fame) spoke during consideration of the Fordney-McCumber tariff bill (H. R. 7456) against raising tariffs which would increase the price of pharmaceuticals, including those used to treat influenza (Cong. Rec. 62:6, p. 6197), and he spoke again on a debate on protection for coal-tar products for the same reason (Cong. Rec. 62:13, p. 13859).The influence of the pandemic on debates was even felt outside the realm of trade policy and industrial regulation. For example, in 1922, in a debate on the conference report on the bill (B. R. 9548) “for the relief of the distressed and starving people of Russia”, Democratic Senator Henry F. Ashurst noted that the bill would give “$20,000,000 for relief of distressed Russians; not a penny for relief of distressed Americans”, and quotes from the Washington Times of December 21, 1921, where it was reported how after the closing of a mine “Two thousand men, women, and children, comprising the populace of a West Virginia town—Minden, in Fayette County—are literally starving to death” and that “To add to the misery, an influenza epidemic is sweeping the territory. The death rate has been alarming. Schools have closed; out of 500 pupils only 101 were able to attend classes last week” (Cong. Rec. 62:1, p. 677). This, together with countless similar isolationist sentiments during the debates we read, not all of which of course explicitly stated the impact of the pandemic on their thinking, provides some backing for the idea that the protectionist thinking of contemporaries might have been influenced by the experience of the influenza epidemic.This was not restricted to the United States, of course. We also went through the Australian Parliamentary debates from the relevant period. There is much discussion of quarantines, vaccines, outbreaks on shipping, whether or not to keep churches open, and the closure of state borders—mirroring to a striking degree the contemporary debate on COVID-19 in that country. In one particularly pertinent debateFootnote 11 on the “Supply Bill (No. 1) 1919–20” it is noted that the effects of the war, the flu and outbreaks of strikes are all linked, and the protection of various industries including wheat, wool and dairy produce is discussed, as well as support and subsidies for the mining industry and plans for the “development of Australian production and manufacture”.DataTo investigate more formally the impact of the Spanish flu on trade openness, we make use of several sources of data.Footnote 12 For tariffs we rely on the import-weighted average ad valorem tariff (AVE), as collected by Lampe and Sharp (2013). This is calculated as the ratio of customs duty revenues to total imports for domestic consumption. There are of course a number of issues with this measure of protectionism, as Lampe and Sharp acknowledge. First, some of their data for Germany (1914–24) are interpolated,Footnote 13 although our results are not sensitive to the inclusion of that country.Footnote 14 Second, tariffs at that time were usually specific, and thus declining prices would automatically lead to an increase in ad valorem equivalents. However, using price data from Jordà et al. (2017), we find no significant correlation with our measure of protection. Third, not all protection is captured by tariffs, since subsidies, quantitative restrictions and prohibitions are also of importance. While indeed there was wide use of quantitative restrictions up to the Allied sea blockade of the Central Powers from March 1915, which also affected neutral countries in Europe (Hardach, 1977), except for commercial relationships between especially France and Germany, these were dismantled quickly after the end of the war in Western and Central Europe (Hardach, 1977). From then on, import duties were the main trade frictions (Hardach, 1977; Feinstein et al., 2008). However, the fact that the League of Nations in 1927 sponsored a conference on import and export restrictions and in 1929 the “International Convention for the Abolition of Import and Export Prohibitions and Restrictions” was adopted (Boyce, 1987), might create the impression that in the 1920s, as was to be the case in the 1930s, non-tariff restrictions were omnipresent. They were probably not. The Prohibition Convention contained the possibility of exempting certain goods on a country level, and annexes contained these exemptions. Most had to do with the possibility of strategically limiting exports, and regarding imports we find clauses only referring to coal, coke, peat, lignite and briquettes in Germany and synthetic and organic dyestuffs and colors in the UK, and very little for elsewhere.Footnote 15 We therefore assume that quotas did not distort the level of protection as measured by average tariffs.Our main analysis is conducted using data for measuring the impact of the Spanish flu from Ansart et al. (2009) who estimate the number of cumulative excess deaths due to the Spanish flu pandemic. The reported excess mortality is defined as the difference between the observed and the predicted number of all-cause deaths using the pre period 1906–1917 as baseline) during the pandemic. The exact pandemic period differs from country to country and is defined as the period in which the observed number of deaths exceeded a given threshold. In all countries, it starts during 1918 and ends at some point in the first half of 1919. Thus, the relatively minor peak of the flu in April 1920 experienced by several countries is not accounted for by the excess mortality measure. Besides its drawbacks, using all-cause excess mortality is probably the best way to measure the severity of the pandemic across countries as it is highly comparable. Deaths are rather accurately measured in most countries and using all-cause excess mortality is then less prone to measurement error than any measure of flu-specific deaths, which would largely depend on the right diagnosis of medical personnel, which may differ vastly across countries. This core sample consists of 12 European countries, for which tariffs are also available.Footnote 16As discussed earlier, until now the increase in protectionism in the 1920’s has been explained with the adverse effects of World War I. Clearly, the concurrent timing of World War I is the main concern with our analysis: as the pandemic started when the war ended, we have to account for the war to be able to demonstrate an independent effect of the flu. We therefore include a measure of intensity with which a country was affected by the war by using the number of battle deaths suffered during the war in some of the specifications. This measure is taken from the “Correlates of War project” (Sarkees and Wayman, 2010).As a robustness check and to increase external validity, we also present results using an extended sample using data from Barro et al. (2020), who present death rates (relative to total population) for the flu and for World War I. It is important to note that this data presents flu-specific death rates for countries where this measure is available and all-cause excess mortality rates where flu-specific deaths are not available. Barro et al. note, however, a “close correspondence” for those countries where both measures are available. For some countries the timing of deaths is also extrapolated from data of neighboring countries. An advantage of this data, however, is the much more diverse set of countries, a larger number of which did not participate in the First World War. Ultimately, we use data from 29 countriesFootnote 17 as a number of countries cannot be included for our purposes because tariffs are not available, they were subject to colonial relationships or forced tariffs (such as China) or were otherwise obvious outliers in this respect such as the Soviet Union.Table 1 presents summary statistics. Tariffs are measured annually from 1900 to 1939, while the number of excess deaths and battle deaths, has just one observation for each country.Table 1 Summary statistics.Full size tableIn Fig. 2, we map the distribution of excess deaths caused by the Spanish flu in Europe alone while Fig. 3 shows the distribution of the decadal average level of tariffs for the 1910s, 1920s, and 1930s, with darker shades indicating higher levels of deathsariffs. The extreme protectionism of the 1930s is very clear.Footnote 18Fig. 2: Rates of excess deaths caused by the Spanish Flu from 1918 to 1919.Excess death rates are computed as the number of excess deaths per expected deaths. Darker grays indicate higher excess deaths. The countries shaded diagonally participated in WW1.Full size imageFig. 3: Average tariffs in the decades 1910s, 1920s and 1930s.The maps show standardized tariff intervals, in order to make the decades comparable to one another. Panel (A) shows the average tariffs for 1910–1919, Panel (B) shows the average tariffs for the interval 1920–1929, and Panel (C) shows the average tariffs for 1930–1939.Full size imageEmpirical strategyTo identify the effect of excess deaths on the tariffs after the Spanish flu pandemic, we implement a difference-in-differences strategy. This method allows us to obtain an estimate of the average effect of excess deaths on tariffs, i.e., the average treatment effect. Originally the difference-in-differences method was employed in the social sciences to study the effect of new policies. The method attempts to simulate a natural experiment dividing the population into two groups, the treated group (the group experiencing the new policy) and a control group (a group with similar characteristics not experiencing the policy). The two groups are then compared before and after the treatment to establish the average treatment effect of the policy. In our setting, the “treatment” is the level of excess deaths due to the pandemic. Thus, all countries are unaffected before the pandemic but, with the event of the pandemic, some countries are more affected than others. This method allows us to compare the change in the level of tariffs across countries and time, to find the average effect of excess deaths on tariffs.Footnote 19To have a correctly specified model, the timing of the effect is important. We hypothesize that the effect will start after the beginning of the first peak in 1918. Furthermore, we allow for the effect to take place before the end of the pandemic, because it is likely that affected countries took measures against the disease, one of which could be to become less open. These measures could have been implemented while the pandemic was still in progress. An advantage of this is that the time of treatment coincides with the end of the First World War, which is useful for our analysis.To find the average treatment effect of excess deaths, we start by estimating the following difference-in-differences model$$\begin{array}{l}tariff_{it} = \beta _0 + \beta _1post1918_t \ast {\mathrm{ln}}\left( {excessdeaths} \right)_i + \\ \beta _2post1918_t + c_i + \theta _t + \varepsilon _{it},\end{array}$$ (1) where tariffit is the tariff level in year t for country i, post1918t is a dummy taking the value 1 for the years 1919–1939 and zero otherwise. Our main explanatory variable, ln(excessdeaths)i, is the log of excess deaths caused by the Spanish flu. The specification also includes country fixed effects, ci, and year fixed effects, θt. The country fixed effects control for any time invariant characteristics of each country and are allowed to be correlated with the explanatory variables. εit is the error term clustered at the country level. Our main parameter of interest is β1, which gives us the average treatment effect.As noted above, the end of the pandemic coincides with the end of the war, and thus a major concern in Eq. 1 is that we do not control for the war. Indeed, the above discussion makes it likely that countries experiencing the war more severely implemented higher tariffs afterwards. Therefore, for comparison, we also estimate the average treatment effect for the number of battle deaths during the war as:$$\begin{array}{l}tariff_{it} = \beta _0 + \beta _1post1918_t \ast {\mathrm{ln}}\left( {battledeaths} \right)_i + \\ \beta _2post1918_t + c_i + \theta _t + \varepsilon _{it},\end{array}$$ (2) where ln(battledeaths)i is the natural logarithm of (1 + the number of deaths in battle) during the First World War. Note that only about half of the countries in our sample participated in the war and only these will have positive values in the number of deaths.Footnote 20 This means that the number of battle deaths is only positive for these countries.Finally, to assess the relative significance of our two treatments, we also estimate a version where both the pandemic and the war are included simultaneously.ResultsTable 2 provides the results of estimating Eq. 1 to 3 using our core sample.Table 2 Regression results.Full size tableDespite few observations, we obtain significant results at standard significance levels. From column 1 in Table 2 it is clear that there is a positive correlation between the number of excess deaths and the level of tariffs after 1918. We find that a 1 percent change in the number of excess deaths leads to a tariff increase equal to 0.017 percentage points. In terms of standard deviations, one standard deviation more excess deaths implies 0.022 percentage point higher tariffs, corresponding to an increase of one third of a standard deviation in tariffs. From column 2, it is also clear that the number of battle deaths in the First World War had an important effect on tariffs after 1918. On average, one percent more battle deaths results in 0.004 percentage points higher tariffs. In terms of standard deviations, the result is similar to excess deaths, given that one standard deviation more battle deaths implies 0.026 percentage point higher tariffs. It is thus clear that the effect of the war is also not negligible. However, in column 3 where both the effect of the pandemic and the effect of the war are estimated together, the estimate on ln(excessdeaths) remains positive and significantly different from zero at the 1 percent level. The effect of excess flu deaths is in fact stronger than that of battle deaths when including both simultaneously. However, it should also be kept in mind that the number of battle deaths is zero for half of our sample. This, as well as the fact that excess deaths and participation in the war are correlated due to returning soldiers spreading the illness make it difficult to compare the size of the coefficients. Nevertheless, these results together imply that the number of deaths in battle during the war alone was most likely not the only important determinant of tariffs: a non-trivial determinant was indeed mortality during the Spanish flu.A difference-in-differences model relies on the assumption of a common trend. This assumption states that, in the absence of treatment (the pandemiche war), the difference in tariffs between the treatment group and the control group would be constant. In our case this implies that the difference in tariffs before and after 1918 would be constant between countries, had they not experienced the flu or the war. The common trend assumption can be tested by estimating a flexible differences-in-differences model, where ln(excessdeaths) and ln(battledeaths) interact with year dummies including the pre-treatment period. The effect of the two variables is thus allowed to differ in each year. If the assumption holds, all estimates before 1918 should be insignificant, thus showing no trend prior to treatment. In this way, we can also determine when the effects died out, as we expect they might have done with the onset of the Great Depression. Due to the small sample size, we estimate these specifications separately. The results can be seen in Fig. 4.Fig. 4: Estimated coefficients from a flexible model using ln(excessdeaths) or ln(battledeaths) as explanatory variable.Panel (A) shows the point estimates from a flexible difference-in-differences model with ln(excessdeaths) on tariff. Panel (B) shows the point estimates from a flexible difference-in-differences model with ln(battledeaths) on tariff. The base year is 1918 and the error bars show p < 0.1 based on robust standard errors, clustered at the country level.Full size imageFor both the pandemic and the war, there is no clear pre-trend given that almost none of the coefficients are significantly different from zero before 1919. There are a few negative and significant coefficients for both excess deaths and battle deaths in the years during the war. The significant negative estimates during this period could simply reflect that countries participating in the war were more open then, since imports were fundamental for national supply, and countries participating in the war were more affected by the flu. Undoubtedly, the war period is unusual in many respects and it is thus reassuring that the only significant estimates before 1919 are during this period.Thus, without any clear pre-trend, we can conclude that the assumption of a common trend holds. Moreover, Fig. 4 reveals nicely that the coefficients become significant after 1918. As for Table 2, it is clear that both ln(excessdeaths) and ln(batteldeaths) play a role in explaining the tariffs. The effects from the pandemic seem to disappear earlier but, as expected, by the beginning of the 1930s all seem to have vanished. This is consistent with historical events. After 1929 and the Great Depression, countries started to become more protectionist for reasons which, ten years after both shocks, seem to have outweighed the previous determinants.Figures A3–A4 in the supplementary information file show the results when using the extended sample consisting of 29 countries. As mentioned in section “Data”, for the extended sample we have (flu) death rates instead of excess deaths. We thus exchange the variables for excess deaths in Eqs. 1 and 2 with flurate and battlerate. Figure A3 shows the estimations separately, corresponding to Fig. 4 using the core sample. Due to the larger sample, however, it is also possible to include both flurate and batterate in the same flexible estimation, and these results are shown in Fig. A4. Both figures show the same pattern as was demonstrated above, with positive effects both from the flu rate and the battle rate. Although it is less clear than in the smaller sample, it should also be remembered that this larger sample consists of a very diverse set of countries and that especially the variable flu rate is very prone to measurement error, as noted above. However, another advantage is that this more diverse sample also allows us to conduct the analysis using only those countries which did not participate in the war, addressing more directly the aforementioned concern about the confounding timing and effect of the war as well as the fact that the severity with which the country was affected by it is likely to be correlated with the severity of the flu. Estimating only on countries not participating in the war then presents another test of a separate flu effect. Figure A5 shows the point estimates, clearly indicating a positive effect of the flu on tariffs.ConclusionThe impact of pandemics on trade policy is deserving of more attention. We find that it was not only the First World War which led to protection in the 1920s, but also the Spanish flu, and future analyses have the potential to add substantially to this preliminary work, for example by investigating the link to public health policy, which we might assume played a role for determining the severity of the outbreak. This provides an important new dimension to the debate today about the trade-off between the economic benefits versus the human costs of relaxing public health restrictions. It might be the case that the domestic benefits could to a substantial extent be offset by tendencies towards international isolationism.For now, we offer this simple warning: policymakers and the media must take seriously the impact on isolationist policy that the present pandemic might unleash. It is a cliché, but if history teaches us nothing else, it is that we should be wary of making the same mistakes twice, and we should be cautious that the 2020 s do not follow the pattern of the 1920s, if we are to avoid the turmoil the interwar period witnessed. We sincerely hope that our findings do not generalize. Data availability Data sharing not applicable to this article as no new datasets were generated during the current study. We combined data documented in Ansart et al. (2009), Barro et al. (2020), Lampe/Sharp (2013), and Clemens and Williamson (2004), subject to the data availability policies of those papers. The digitalized (United States) Congressional Record (Bound Edition) is available online at https://www.govinfo.gov/ (last accessed 20 February 2021). NotesRuchir Sharma, “The Pandemic Isn’t Changing Everything”, New York Times, May 3, 2020.Marcano (2020) makes similar speculations but provides limited quantitative analysis.“What an extraordinary episode in the economic progress of man that age was which came to an end in August 1914! … The inhabitant of London could order by telephone, sipping his morning tea in bed, the various products of the whole earth, in such quantity as he might see fit, and reasonably expect their early delivery upon his doorstep; he could at the same moment and by the same means adventure his wealth in the natural resources and new enterprises of any quarter of the world … or he could decide to couple the security of his fortunes with the good faith of the townspeople of any substantial municipality in any continent that fancy or information might recommend. He could secure forthwith, if he wished it, cheap and comfortable means of transit to any country or climate without passport or other formality … most important of all, he regarded this state of affairs as normal, certain, and permanent, except in the direction of further improvement, and any deviation from it as aberrant, scandalous, and avoidable. The projects and politics of militarism and imperialism, of racial and cultural rivalries, of monopolies, restrictions, and exclusion … appeared to exercise almost no influence at all on the ordinary course of social and economic life, the internationalization of which was nearly complete in practice.” -Keynes (1920, pp. 9–10).Aggregate preferences may also be affected by other factors. Gozgor (2020), for example, shows that demographics, health and educational levels are related to trust in the government during the current COVID-19 crisis.The non-adoption of this principle is often attributed to Wilson’s relatively weak position in trade liberalization, as at the same time the US was turning more—non-discriminatorily— protectionist (Hardach, 1977, p. 242). Nevertheless, this “sorry result” (ibid., p. 243) might also be connected to, as Spinney (2018) suggests, the fact that Wilson and his advisor Edward House suffered from influenza during the 1919 Paris Conference, and more importantly suffered from a related stroke later that year that could have compromised Wilson’s strength in a way that meant that he might otherwise have been able to push more strongly for the US to join the League of Nations. This, of course, remains speculative counterfactual history.Cf. Shyam A, Krishna, “How the Spanish flu changed the course of Indian history: Gandhi survived the pandemic that united Indians against the British”, Gulf News, March 15, 2020.During the COVID-19 pandemic, enforced lockdowns have given a more direct economic incentive, due to rising unemployment and the failure of firms.Although falling prices and falling economic activity explain a larger share of the post-1929 trade collapse, see de Bromhead et al. (2019) and Irwin (1998).We searched all volumes of Congressional Record from November 1918 until September 1922, and further examined incidences of the words “tariff” and “duty/duties” in proximity of “influenza” and “flu”, which produced several hits in 58 Cong. Rec. (Bound)—Volume 58, Part 6 (September 13, 1919 to October 4, 1919), 60 Cong. Rec. (Bound)—Volume 60, Part 2 (January 7, 1921 to January 28, 1921), 61 Cong. Rec. (Bound)—Volume 61, Part 4 (June 29, 1921 to July 22, 1921), 62 Cong. Rec. (Bound)— Volume 62, Part 1 (December 5, 1921 to January 11, 1922), 62 Cong. Rec. (Bound)—Volume 62, Part 6 (April 13, 1922 to May 8, 1922), 62 Cong. Rec. (Bound)—Volume 62, Part 13 (December 5, 1921 to September 22, 1922). Many of these hits, however, were pure coincidence of mentions on the same page or referred to “military duty” and the like.See note 5 above.Commonwealth of Australia, Parliamentary Debates, House of Representatives Official Hansard No. 26, 1919.
