Here, we report a lineage of naturally occurring human antibodies sharing the same germline gene, VH3-48/VK1-12. These antibodies broadly neutralize the major circulating strains of IAV in vitro and in vivo mainly by binding a contiguous epitope of H3N2 HA, but a conformational epitope of H1N1 HA, respectively. Our structural and functional studies of antibody 28-12 revealed that the continuous amino acids in helix A, particularly N49HA2 of H3 HA, are critical to determine the binding feature with 28-12. In contrast, the conformational epitope feature is dependent on the discontinuous segments involving helix A, the fusion peptide, and several HA1 residues within H1N1 HA. We report that this antibody was initially selected by H3 (group 2) viruses and evolved via somatic hypermutation to enhance the reactivity to H3 and acquire cross-neutralization to H1 (group 1) virus. These findings enrich our understanding of different antigenic determinants of heterosubtypic influenza viruses for the recognition of bnAbs and provide a reference for the design of influenza vaccines and more effective antiviral drugs.

Given the rapid antigen drift and shift of influenza viruses, the current seasonal influenza vaccines are insufficient to meet broad social needs. The emergence of drug-resistant influenza viruses limits the widespread use of anti-influenza drugs2,3. Therefore, there is an urgent medical need for a more universal solution to meet the challenge of influenza A viruses. Genetically, 16 IAV subtypes are classified into two distinct groups according to the phylogenetics of hemagglutinin (HA)2,4,5, with another two new analogous HAs isolated from bats (named H17 and H18)6,7. Usually, the H5 and H7 subtypes are highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses associated with sporadic severe human infection8. H1 and H3 subtypes circulate annually in human society and are therefore the components of seasonal influenza vaccines1,9. The envelope glycoprotein HA of IAV is the major target of neutralizing antibodies10. The globular head domain mediates the receptor binding process, and the HA stem leads to virus-cell membrane fusion induced by the low pH in endosomes1,11.Several human antibodies have been isolated from vaccinated or naturally infected individuals that target conserved epitopes within HA that showed different levels of cross-reactivity towards group 1 and group 2 influenza A viruses. The majority of bnAbs target the HA stem region, thus neutralizing influenza A viruses by inhibiting the low pH-induced conformational rearrangement of HA, hence blocking membrane fusion; while a small fraction of them targets the conserved HA head region and block HA-sialic acid receptor binding9,12,13,14,15,16,17. VH1-69, VH1-18, VH3-30 and VH6-1 have shown dominant biased usage of germline genes for the stem-directed bnAbs against IAVs18. The characterized bnAbs have provided powerful tools to identify such dominant germline scaffolds, thus speeding up the development of broad-spectrum therapeutic agents19. Moreover, understanding how bnAbs overcome highly diversified HA antigenic variations to broadly neutralize divergent IAVs would also contribute to the development of universal influenza vaccines.In the current study, we report a lineage of naturally occurring human antibodies isolated from a healthy donor who was vaccinated with a trivalent seasonal split vaccine. The representative antibody 28-12 exhibited broad neutralizing activity against both group 1 and group 2 IAV viruses in vitro and protected mice against H3N2 and H1N1 virus challenge in vivo. The character of this lineage of human antibodies is unusual. These antibodies (28-2, 28-4, 28-6, and 28-12) belong to the same lineage carrying VH3-48/DH2-2/JH6 and VK1-12/JK5 gene segments. It is worth noting that these antibodies showed different epitope determinants between different subtypes that they mainly bind a continuous epitope of H3N2 HA, while recognizing H1N1 HA in a conformation dependent pattern. The reason can be elucidated from our functional studies combined with our cryo-EM structures of 28-12 Fab in complex with HAs of H1N1 and H3N2. The binding activity of 28-12 to H1N1 is much more dependent on helix A, the fusion peptide and several HA1 residues, which are discontinuous in the primary sequence. Nevertheless, the continuous epitope within the helix A of H3N2 HA makes the major contribution to the binding of 28-12. We further revealed that N49HA2 is the critical residue to determine the epitope feature of H3N2 HA by 28-12; however, the equivalent residue is substituted by T49HA2 in H1N1. We further revealed that 28-12 was likely first primed by group 2 viruses (H3) and further enhanced the reactivity to H3 and acquired cross-neutralization against group 1 viruses (H1). We described the putative key somatic hypermutations of 28-12 to achieve broad and potent neutralization. This study improves our understanding of the significant flexibility of bnAbs in recognizing distinct antigenic determinants among different IAV subtypes. Our finding supports 28-12 as a potential therapeutic reagent for both prophylaxis and treatment of circulating H1N1 and H3N2 IAV infection in humans and provide a reference for the design of broad influenza vaccines and more effective antiviral drugs.ResultsIsolation and characterization of VH3-48/VK1-12 lineage antibodiesWe conducted single-cell PCR experiments to screen mAbs that might protect against heterosubtypic IAV infection from memory B cells of one healthy individual ~4 week after vaccination with seasonal trivalent influenza vaccine in 2016, which contains three components, A/California/7/2009(H1N1) pdm09-like virus, A/Victoria/361/2011(H3N2)-like virus and B/Wisconsin/1/2010-like virus (Fig. 1a). We performed memory B cell screening experiments using group 2 A/HongKong/01/1968 (HK/68) H3N2 HA protein as the bait. As the H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes are the most prevalent circulating strains, subsequent cloning and screening of antibodies for reactivity were conducted with soluble HA proteins and human infecting viruses of both HK/68 H3N2 and SC/09 H1N1(A/Sichuan/01/2009), which led to the identification of a series of antibodies with different levels of cross-reactivity towards H1N1 and H3N2. Among these antibodies, eleven mAbs cross-neutralizes both H3N2 and H1N1. Notably, 28-4, and 28-12 showed better cross-neutralizing activity with IC50 under 2 μg/ml as compared with other isolated antibodies in this study, which is comparable with a previously reported antibody MEDI8852 (Fig. 1b).Fig. 1: A lineage of antibodies with cross-reactivity to H3N2 and H1N1 subtypes were identified.a Schematic of isolation of influenza HA specific antibodies from an individual vaccinated with trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine. The isolated antibodies were tested for dose-dependent binding and neutralizing activities against group 2 HK/68 H3N2 and group 1 SC/09 H1N1 (b). 8D6, an unrelated HCV antibody was included as a negative control.

A large portion of antibodies utilized the VH3-48 germline genes (Fig. 1c), of which, 28-2, 28-4, 28-6 and 28-12, belong to the same lineage carrying VH3-48/DH2-2/JH6 and VK1-12/JK5 gene segments with cross-group neutralizing activity (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 1). We named 28-2, 28-4, 28-6 and 28-12 antibodies as VH3-48/VK1-12 lineage antibodies.Broad binding and neutralization profile of VH3-48/VK1-12 lineage antibodiesTo verify the reactive breadth of the VH3-48/VK1-12 lineage antibodies, BLI-based KD values were measured within each mAb to purified soluble HA proteins from divergent subtypes of group 1 and group 2 IAVs. Each VH3-48/VK1-12 lineage mAb displayed comparable binding constant (KD value) to each HA protein from different subtypes that belong to group 2 (the human infecting H3, H7 strains and the avian H4, H14 strains) and group 1 (the human infecting H1, H9 strains and the avian H6, H8 strains) viruses with KD values ranging from 0.001 to 32.5 nM (Fig. 2a).Fig. 2: VH3-48/VK1-12 lineage antibodies broadly bind and neutralize multiple influenza subtypes.a Binding affinity (KD) of each mAb to HA proteins from a panel of group 1 and group 2 influenza A isolates as measured by BLI.

Representative data are shown from two independent experiments.Full size imageTo extend the evaluation, we directly compared the in vitro neutralization activity and breadth of VH3-48/VK1-12 lineage antibodies with those of MEDI8852 and 39.29 using a diverse panel of influenza strains from group 1 and group 2 viruses. All VH3-48/VK1-12 lineage antibodies neutralized the tested H3N2 (A/HongKong/01/1968 and A/Jiangxi-Donghu/312/2006) and H1N1 (A/Sichuan/01/2009 and A/California /07/2009) viruses. Most of the antibodies tested failed to neutralize the A/Shanghai/02/2013 H7N9 virus, except for MEDI8852 and 28-12, with IC50 values of 7.615 and 36.64 μg/ml, respectively. Antibody 39.29 failed to neutralize the A/duck/Hunan/8-19/2009 H4N2 virus at the highest concentration tested (50 μg/ml). 28-12 exhibited neutralizing potency against group1 H1 strains with an average IC50 values of 1.53 μg/ml, compared to values of 6.38, 3.02 and 11.02 μg/ml for 28-2, 28-4 and 28-6, respectively. They also neutralize group 2 H3 strains with average IC50 values of 3.61, 4.19, 6.72 and 2.256 μg/ml for 28-2, 28-4, 28-6 and 28-12, respectively. MEDI8852 and 39.29 were included as positive controls with comparable IC50s to H1 and H3 strains (Fig. 2b).To further define whether the binding of the VH3-48/VK1-12 lineage antibodies to HA proteins was conformation dependent, we denatured the H3 and H1 HA proteins and performed ELISA. We found the VH3-48/VK1-12 lineage antibodies showed comparable reactivity with both untreated and denatured H3 HA. In contrast, they lost the ability to bind the denatured H1 HA (Fig. 2c). Further study showed that 28-12 mainly recognizes a continuous epitope in H3 clade subtypes, but a conformational epitope in H7 clade and some group 1 subtypes, indicating a rare and unique recognition pattern (Supplementary Fig. 2a–f).As reported, some HA stem bnAbs are typically prone to polyreactive20,21. From the ELISA and immunofluorescence-based assays, we found the VH3-48/VK1-12 lineage antibodies are HA specific and have little or no binding affinity to other self-antigens and proteins in HEp-2 cells (Supplementary Fig. 3).Prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of 28-12 in vivoWe further carried out in vivo protection studies of 28-12 in mice against lethal influenza challenges of two different strains, group 1 SC/09 H1 and group 2 HK/68 H3. In the prophylaxis assay, the mice were first administered different doses of 28-12 (30, 10, 3, or 1 mg/kg) and then challenged with a lethal dose of H1N1 and H3N2 viruses 24 h later. The administration of a lower dose of 28-12 (1 or 3 mg/kg) fully protected the mice from H1N1 (Fig. 3e, f) or H3N2 (Fig. 3a, b) infection. To evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of 28-12, we administered 28-12 (25 mg/kg) at different time points following infection with SC/09 H1 or HK/68 H3 viruses. The data showed that all the mice survived when treated with 28-12 at day 2 post infection with HK/68 H3, and 80% survival was achieved when inoculation was delayed for 3 days, with slightly reduced body weight, which recovered starting on day 3 or day 4 (Fig. 3c, d). In the challenge model of SC/09 H1, 80% or 100% of the mice survived when treated with 28-12 1 or 2 days’ post infection, while only 40% survival was observed when antibody treatment was delayed for 3 days (Fig. 3g, h). Overall, these results indicate that 28-12 could broadly protect mice against both H1N1 and H3N2 viruses in vivo.Fig. 3: Prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of 28-12 in mice.a, b Prophylactic efficacy of 28-12 against a lethal challenge with 68/HK H3.

All data show a representative experiment from two independent experiments.Full size imageCryo-EM structures of 28-12 Fab-HA complexesOur biochemical and functional data suggested that VH3-48/VK1-12 lineage antibodies neutralize H3N2 mainly by targeting a continuous epitope of HA, while reacting to a conformational epitope to H1N1 (Fig. 2c). To provide the structural basis of the unique recognition pattern, we determined the cryo-EM structures of the 28-12 Fab in complex with the trimeric HAs from HK/68 H3 and WA/11 H1 at 3.7-Å- and 3.5-Å-resolutions, respectively, with imposed C3 symmetry (Fig. 4a, b and Supplementary Figs. 4–5). To overcome the preferred orientation problem (preferred top-view orientation) associated with the 28-12-H3 complex, also seen in the H3N2 Hong Kong HA trimer (HK/68 H3)22, we adopted the stage-tilt strategy for data collection22. We then built an atomic model for the 28-12-H3 and 28-12-H1 complexes, respectively, and the model fits in the corresponding map well (Supplementary Figs. 4e, f and 5d, e).Fig. 4: Cryo-EM structures of 28-12-H3 and 28-12-H1 and distinct recognition patterns of 28-12 Fab to H3 and H1 HAs.a, b Cryo-EM maps of the 28-12-H1 (a) and 28-12-H3 (b) complexes.

This color scheme was followed throughout. c, f Epitopes of the 28-12 Fab on H1 (c) and H3 (f), respectively.

Each value is calculated as the binding ratio relative to that of the WT HA (%). The two black dotted lines represent 100 and 125% relative binding to the WT data, respectively. The mean values of duplicates are shown from two independent experiments (o, p).Full size imageThe structural and functional basis for the unique recognition pattern of 28-12Our two cryo-EM structures showed that the 28-12 Fab specifically recognizes the conserved HA stem region for both H3 and H1 (Fig. 4a, b). Consistently, 28-12 inhibited cell–cell fusion by blocking low-pH induced HA conformational change (Supplementary Fig. 6). We divided the amino acids that constitute the epitope of 28-12 Fab on H3 or H1 into two parts: amino acids within helix A of HA2, and amino acids within the fusion peptide and HA1 (Fig. 4c, f).Interestingly, our structural comparison revealed that the binding pattern of 28-12 to H1 and H3 HAs is distinct to some extent. Overall, 28-12 appears to form more contacts with the fusion peptide and the HA1 residues adjacent to helix A in H1 than with those in H3 (Fig. 4c, f, m). For H1, the D19HA2 within the fusion peptide forms hydrogen bonds with S54HCDR2, N56HCDR2, T57HCDR2, and Y112HCDR3; S299HA1 forms hydrogen bond with Y108HCDR3 (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Table 3). Moreover, W21HA2 on the fusion peptide forms hydrophobic interactions with V109HCDR3. Another two amino acids from HA1, including V40HA1 (which is a hydrophilic amino acid N40 in H3) and L300HA1 also form hydrophobic interactions with V109 and Y108 both from HCDR3 (Fig. 4d, i, j and Supplementary Table 2).In contrast, H3 contributes only two epitope residues outside helix A to interact with 28-12. Specifically, H3 D19HA2 on the fusion peptide forms hydrogen bonds with T57HCDR2 and Y112HCDR3 (Fig. 4g and Supplementary Table 3), and H3 W21HA2 on the fusion peptide forms hydrophobic interactions with V109HCDR3 (Fig. 4g, k, l and Supplementary Table 2). Besides, we also calculated the atom-to-atom contacts between 28-12 and the fusion peptide/HA1 of H1 and H3, respectively, under a distance cut-off value of 4.5 Å (Fig. 4m and Supplementary Tables 4 and 5). It appears that 28-12 forms more contacts with H1 (48 contacts) than that with H3 (17 contacts). On the basis of our structural analysis, we performed further site-directed single mutation of the epitope residues in the fusion peptide and HA1 and determined the binding activity between HA and 28-12. The mutations D19AHA2, W21AHA2, and V40AHA1 in H1 significantly decreased H1 HA reactivity to 28-12 (Fig. 4p), while the mutations D19AHA2 and W21AHA2 in H3 did not affect H3 HA binding activity to 28-12 (Fig. 4o). Collectively, these results indicate that the epitope in the fusion peptide and HA1 is indispensable for 28-12 to react with H1.Furthermore, helix A is another critical element for 28-12 to recognize both H3 and H1. Our structural analysis suggested that there are epitope amino acids shared by both H3 and H1, including Q42HA2, D46HA2, N53HA2, and E57HA2 forming hydrogen bonds with HCDR3, and K39HA2 forming salt bridge with D92LCDR3 (Fig. 4c–h and Supplementary Table 3). In addition, we found that A36HA2, L38HA2, I45HA2, I48HA2, I56HA2, and W21HA2 form hydrophobic interactions with HCDR2 or HCDR3 (Fig. 4i–l and Supplementary Table 2). Notably, H3 has a unique epitope residue, N49HA2, which forms strong hydrogen bonds with C102, N106, Y108, and V109 on HCDR3 (Fig. 4h and Supplementary Table 3). Overall, the atom-to-atom contact numbers between 28-12 and H1 or H3 helix A are 144 and 191, respectively (Fig. 4n and Supplementary Tables 4 and 5). It is worth noting that the H3 residue N49HA2 contributes much more contact numbers (32) with 28-12 than the substitute residues T49HA2 (10) of H1 (Fig. 4n and Supplementary Tables 4 and 5). The site-directed mutational binding assay also confirmed that N49HA2 is critical for H3 HA binding to 28-12, while T49AHA2 did not affect the binding between H1 HA and 28-12 (Fig. 4o, p). Collectively, these results indicate that the epitopes within helix A are critical for 28-12 to react with both H1 and H3, and form more interactions with H3.Interestingly, antibody 28-12 harbors a long HCDR3 with 23 amino acids compared with many of the reported bnAbs9,12,13,23 (Supplementary Fig. 1 and 7), in line with our structural observation that HCDR3 heavily contributes to the interactions with HA proteins, which form multiple hydrogen bonds or hydrophobic interactions with antigens (Fig. 4c–n). We also compared the HCDR3 of 28-12 with 3I14 which also has a long HCDR3 (23aa) in length. For one single protomer (on the primary protomer), 3I14 HCDR3 mainly makes hydrophobic and hydrogen bonds with helix A and the fusion peptide, which is similar with 28-12 HCDR3 in recognizing H3 HA. Additionally, 28-12 HCDR3 also contacts with several HA1 residues of H1, but not H3, for the primary protomer. It seems that the HCDR3 of 28-12 is more significant than that of 3I14 to recognize HA as it contributes more amino acids to interact with H3 HA (12) and H1 HA (11), respectively, while 3I14 devotes 7 HCDR3 amino acids to interact with H3 or H6 (Supplementary Fig. 7).Fig. 5: N49HA2 is critical for the recognition of H3 epitope features by VH3-48/VK1-12 lineage antibodies.a Sequence alignment of the conserved epitope 36-57HA2 of H1 and H3. b Dose-dependent binding of 28-12 to divergent mutants of H3 peptide 36-57HA2 compared with the wild-type peptide. c Sequence alignment of 36-57HA2 within multiple subtypes.

Data are presented as mean values of duplicates (b, d, e, f). Representative data are shown from two independent experiments (b, d, e, f).Full size imageWe also found that the cleavage of HA0 (the activated HA) doesn’t affect the binding activity of 28-12 to this epitope on H3N2 HA, but obviously impairs the reactivity to H1N1 HA, as compared with the binding to HA0 protein (Supplementary Fig. 8). These data further indicate the distinct intrinsic properties of HA proteins from different HA subtypes within 28-12 epitope.N49HA2 is critical for 28-12 binding to the continuous epitope within H3 helix ATo further confirm the critical residues composing the epitope for 28-12 binding to H3, we conducted sequence alignment of HA2 residues 36-57 between H1 and H3 and identified 6 different residues (Fig. 5a). We synthesized 6 peptides with single substitution mutations from H3 to H1 and found that the binding ability decreased significantly when there was a mutation from N to T at position 49 of HA2 compared with the wild-type peptide. Nevertheless, other single mutations did not affect binding (Fig. 5b). This result is also consistent with our structural data that H3 N49HA2, but not H1 T49HA2, strongly interacts with HCDR3 residues Y108 and V109 of 28-12, with hydrogen bonds and more atom-to-atom contacts (Fig. 4e, h, n and Supplementary Table 3). Sequence alignment of 36-57HA2 within divergent subtypes showed that all H3 clade IAVs (H3/H4/H14) share a residue N at position 49HA2 but a residue T in other subtypes (Fig. 5c). Similarly, the VH3-48/VK1-12 lineage antibodies reacted well to the peptides 36-57HA2 of H3/H4/H14 subtypes, but not other subtypes (Fig. 5d–f). In brief, these data demonstrated that the residue N49HA2 of helix A is critical for 28-12 binding to the continuous antigenic epitope of H3, and further indicate different epitope features of HA proteins between H1 and H3 subtypes for antibody binding.Fig. 6: Somatic hypermutations of 28-12.a Sequence alignment of 28-12 and its UCA.

Representative data are shown from two independent experiments (b, c).Full size imageRole of somatic mutations in shaping antibody 28-12To determine how the unmutated common ancestor (UCA) of 28-12 evolved to achieve cross-group neutralization with distinct recognition patterns, we analyzed the contribution of somatic mutations of 28-12 carrying 8 amino acid substitutions in VH and 9 amino acid substitutions in VL (Fig. 6a). We first expressed 28-12 germline versions (GHGLs) and versions formed by 28-12 light chains paired with germline heavy chains (GHLs) and vice versa (HGLs). The fully germline version (GHGL) of 28-12 reacted with a panel of group 2 H3N2 isolates but failed to recognize a panel of group 1 H1N1 isolates, indicating that the UCA antibody may have initially been selected by a H3N2 virus. 28-12 recognition required somatic mutations in both heavy and light chains, with the mutations in light chain dominating the contribution while heavy chain showing minor but indispensable roles (Fig. 6b, c). We then reverted the somatic mutations into germline sequences with single amino acid substitutions. The reversion of the somatic mutations at positions 32, 53, 92 (Y32W, R53S, and D92N) of the light chain and position 114 (F114A) of the heavy chain significantly decreased the binding activity to H3N2 and affected the potency to H1N1 (Fig. 6d).We further elucidated the structural basis for the effects of somatic mutations. For both 28-12-H3 and 28-12-H1 complexes, VL R53 forms hydrogen bonds with the main chain of VH S103 in HCDR3, in the meanwhile, VH S103 also contacts with residue D46HA2 through hydrogen bonds (Fig. 6e). Mutation of VL R53 to germline residues may destabilize HCDR3 conformation, thus decreasing the reactivity to residue D46HA2 of both H3N2 and H1N1 HAs by 28-12. VL D92 and VH F114 are also within the antibody interface. Mutation of VL D92 to germline residue N abolished the salt bridge with K39HA2 for both H1N1 and H3N2 (Fig. 6f). Moreover, VH F114 forms important hydrophobic interactions with L38HA2 for both H3N2 and H1N1, which may be abolished by mutation of VH F114 to A (Fig. 6g). Mutation of VL Y32 to germline residue W is not involved in the binding interface and it may change the antibody conformation to decrease the reactivity to HAs.These findings indicate that naive B cells that generated 28-12 could recognize H3N2 and that successional somatic mutations enhanced the reactivity to H3N2 and concurrently evolved the cross-reactivity to H1N1.DiscussionH1N1 and H3N2 IAVs circulate annually. Recently, coinfection with IAV was reported to enhance SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, thus posing another threat to public health during the COVID-19 pandemic24,25,26. HA stem region-directed bnAbs provide an option for antibody-based therapeutics against novel emerging IAVs from zoonotic origin and seasonal circulating IAV strains. In addition, universal vaccine design has also been inspired by the epitopes and recognition patterns of bnAbs. Structural analysis of antibody/HA complexes enhances our understanding of cross-group heterosubtypic binding features.In this study, we identified a linage mAbs, 28-2, 28-4, 28-6 and 28-12 belonging to the same lineage VH3-48/DH2-2/JH6 and VK1-12/JK5, which is rarely reported. In addition to VH3-48, broad neutralizing antibodies using VH1-18, VH1-69, VH6-1 and VH3-30 germline genes have also been reported, which indicates the diverse germline selection of broad-spectrum antibodies against IAVs.Their recognition pattern is also unique, as they mainly bind a continuous epitope within H3N2 HA, but a fully conformational epitope within H1N1 HA. The antigenic determinant differences, especially the N49HA2 (H3) / T49HA2 (H1) revealed distinct antigenicity of HA proteins between H1 and H3. The epitope dependency on the distant HA1 residues and the fusion peptide in the primary sequence probably makes the epitope in H1 HA more conformational by 28-12. Another reason might be attributed to the biophysical features of VH3-48/VK1-12 lineage antibodies. The long and flexible variable regions, especially the 23 amino acids of HCDR3, might adopt different conformations to fit structurally divergent antigens. HCDR3 residues 108Y and 109 V make hydrophobic interaction with L52HA2 (H3) or V52HA2 (H1). 108Y and 109 V also makes hydrophobic contacts with some HA1 residues V40, S299 and L300 of H1, but not H3. 106NHCDR3 forms hydrogen bond with N53HA2 in H1, and all N53HA2, N49HA2 and E57HA2 in H3. In addition, the observations of the differential binding of 28-12 to H1 and H3 cleaved HAs also indicate the distinct intrinsic properties of HAs within this epitope. We hypothesis that cleavage of H1 HA0 may cause conformational change and destroy the integrity of epitope in H1 HA, thus resulting in reduced binding activity to antibody 28-12. However, cleavage of H3 HA0 may not change the overall epitope structure, therefore the cleaved H3 HA still maintains the reactivity to 28-12. Thus, the epitope feature differences among distinct IAV subtypes should be carefully evaluated in the design of HA stem-based immunogens during universal influenza vaccine development.Comparison of 28-12 with previously reported cross-group anti-HA stem bnAbs revealed that the helix A-targeting bnAbs bind HAs with overlapping but distinct binding sites and multiple approaching angles towards the HA stem region. The epitopes of antibodies CR6261, CT149, 39.29, CR9114 and FI6v3 all span HA1 and HA2 regions on one single protomer (for the primary protomer). 3I14 only binds HA2 of the primary protomer. However, here 28-12 shows different binding dependency on HA1 epitope residues, which is important for binding to H1 (HA1 residues V40, S299 and L300), but not H3 (Supplementary Figs. 9, 11 and Fig. 4c–e). The cross-binding on HA1 and HA2 regions on one protomer probably makes the epitope more conformation dependent. Consistent with the structural analysis, both the non-HA1/HA2 spanning mAbs (for one single protomer) 28-12 and 3I14 showed binding activity to the continuous epitope of H3 peptide 36-57HA2, but not to H1 (Supplementary Fig. 10). A critical reason for this unique binding feature might be attributed to the critical residue N49HA2 in H3 for both 28-12 and 3I14, which is T49HA2 in H1 (Fig. 6a). Of noting, 28-12 displayed different germline with 3I14 (VH3-30) and engaged less epitopes in the adjacent protomer (Supplementary Fig. 9). 28-12 is also unique as it has a long HCDR3 (23aa), which makes more extensive interaction with HA protein than other bnAbs. Although 3I14 also has a long HCDR3 (23aa), it seems that the HCDR3 of 28-12 is more significant than 3I14 to recognize HA as it contributes more amino acids to interact with H3N2 HA (12) and H1N1 HA (11), respectively, while 3I14 devotes 7 HCDR3 amino acids to interact with H3 and H6 HAs (Supplementary Fig. 7). Thus, 28-12 represents a unique example among the helix A targeting bnAbs. The HCDR3 of 28-12 might be developed as a potential template to produce small proteins or peptide-based antivirals as recently reported27,28.We quantified the contribution of 28-12 lineage in broad-reactive B cells by analyzing four reported HA specific human antibody datasets20,29,30,31. Generally, 1.619% (17 out of 1050) cross-reactive B cells utilized VH3-48 germline genes among the four analyzed datasets. However, antibodies using both VH3-48 and VK1-12 germline genes are not found in the four analyzed datasets. From B cell repertoires of healthy donors with paired heavy chain and light chain using a dataset from DeKosky et al., which contained 134,345 sequences in total from three healthy donors32, B cells engaging VH3-48 and VK1-12 concurrently are rare with frequency ranging from 0.060% to 0.078%. We thus consider this as a special case in our study. We also found the 28-12 epitope-targeting antibodies in the serum of vaccinated human donors could be detected but exist as a relatively low frequency (Supplementary Fig. 12).The recognition pattern of the antibodies to group 1 or group 2 IAVs embodies the flexibility of bnAbs against influenza A viruses: the continuous encounter of HA antigens with similar but slightly different B cell epitopes results in the in vivo evolution of VH3-48/VK1-12 lineage antibodies. Similar to previously reported models of VH6-1 and other lineages of bnAbs that developed from group 2-specific germline precursors9,16, we revealed that 28-12 UCAs showed group 2 viruses (H3) tendentious and subsequently enhanced their reactivity to group 2 viruses and acquired cross-reactivity to group 1 viruses (H1) by somatic mutations. These findings also reaffirmed the possibility of inducing cross-reactive antibodies via rationally designed sequential immunization with different HA immunogens.In summary, the human antibody 28-12 itself is of high neutralizing potency and not polyreactive, therefore could serve as a potential antiviral drug for both prophylaxis and treatment of circulating H1N1 and H3N2 IAV infection. Additionally, the unique epitope targeted by 28-12 and the paratope of 28-12, especially the HCDR3 sheds some lights on the design of potential universal vaccines and more effective antiviral drugs against IAVs.MethodsEthics statementThe procedures in this study involving in the isolation of HA-specific memory B cells from the volunteer and the influenza virus-related experiments were approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Institut Pasteur of Shanghai, Chinese Academic of Sciences.

These viruses were used in the in vitro microneutralization assay. The A/Hong Kong/01/1968 (HA, NA) x A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H3N2) and A/Sichuan/1/2009 (H1N1) viruses were used in the in vivo assay. MDCK, HeLa and HEK293T cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA) and cultured in Dμlbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, Gibco) with 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS). CHO cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were cultured in Expi™ CHO expression medium.Recombinant HA proteinsThe gene encoding the trimeric ectodomains of the HK/68 H3 and WA/11 H1 HA proteins with a T4 fibritin trimerization motif in the C-terminus were expressed in a Bac-to-Bac Baculovirus Expression System (Invitrogen) and used for structural study. HA proteins were purified by affinity chromatography using a His trap Excel column (GE, EDTA-resistant) and size-exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 10/300 column (GE Healthcare).The following recombinant HAs expressed either from baculovirus or mammalian expression systems were all utilized for the binding affinity assay: A/Hong Kong/01/1968 (H3N2) HA (Sino Biological, cat. no. 40116-V08B), A/Netherlands/219/2003 (H7N7) HA (Sino Biological, cat. no. 11082-V08B), A/Brevig Mission/1/1918 (H1N1) HA (Sino Biological, cat. no. 11068-V08H), A/Florida/04/2017 HA (Sino Biological, cat. no. 40683-V08H), A/WSN/1933 (H1N1) HA (Sino Biological, cat. no. 11692-V08H), A/chicken/Guangdong/C273/2011 (H6N2) HA (Sino Biological, cat. no. 40398-V08B), A/pintail duck/Alberta/114/1979 (H8N4) HA (Sino Biological, cat. no. 11722-V08B), A/Hong Kong/1073/1999 (H9N2) HA (Sino Biological, cat. no. 40040-V08B), A/Missouri/09/2014 (H3N2) HA (Sino Biological, cat. no. 40494-V08B), A/Netherlands/178/1995 (H3N2) HA (Sino Biological, cat. no. 40486-V08B), A/chicken/Alabama/01/1975 (H4N8) HA (Sino Biological, cat. no. 40025-V08B), A/mallard duck/Alberta/299/1977 (H4N4) HA (Sino Biological, cat. no. 40008-V08B), A/Mallard/Astrakhan/263/1982 (H14N5) HA (Sino Biological, cat. no. 40192-V08B) A/California/06/2009 (H1N1) HA (Sino Biological, cat. no. 11055-V08B).The isolation of HA-specific memory B cellsThis study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Institut Pasteur of Shanghai, CAS (IPS-2016004). The informed consent was obtained by the participant. Blood was collected from a female volunteer previously ~ 4 weeks after inoculating with seasonal split influenza vaccine after she had signed the informed consent form. The vaccine was produced by Shanghai Institute of Biological Products Co., Ltd. in 2016, which contains three components, A/California/7/2009(H1N1) pdm09-like virus, A/Victoria/361/2011(H3N2)-like virus and B/Wisconsin/1/2010-like virus. Fresh PBMCs were isolated from the collected blood by using the Ficoll-Paque gradient (GE Healthcare, cat. no. 17144002). The PBMCs were stained with a FITC-labeled mouse anti-human CD19 antibody (BD PharmingenTM, cat. no. 555412) and an APC-labeled mouse anti-human IgG antibody (BD PharmingenTM, cat. no. 550931). The recombinant HK/68 H3N2 HA protein was labeled with biotin using the EZ-Link Sμlfo-NHS-LC Biotin biotinylation reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no. 21335), which could bind to the streptavidin-Cy3 conjugate (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no. S6402). Single FITC-CD19+/APC-IgG+/streptavidin-Cy3 conjugate-HA-specific memory B cells were isolated with a BD InfluxTM Cell Sorter and sorted into 96-well plates. The data were analyzed by FlowJo V10 software.Cloning, expression and purification of antibodiesThe amino acid sequences of heavy and light chain variable regions of MEDI8852 (5JW49), CR802023 (3SDY), CR9114 (4FQY13), CT149 (4UBD15), 39.29 (4KVN14), FI6v3 (3ZTJ16), 3I14 (6WF033), S139/134 (4GMS) and 5j835 (GenBank: JF791168: and JF791169) were downloaded from PDB or NCBI GenBank, codon optimized in mammalian cells and synthesized by Shanghai Generay Biotech. The cloning of the IgG1 VH and VK chain expression plasmids was previously described36. The plasmids encoding the VH and VK chain of antibodies were cotransfected into Expi™ CHO cells, and cultured according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no. A29129). Antibodies were purified from the Expi™CHO cell supernatants using Protein A Agarose (MabSelect Prism A, GE Healthcare).Microneutralization assayThe microneutralization assay was performed as previously described36. Briefly, MDCK cells were seeded into 96-well plates the day before the experiment, washed twice with PBS, and then incubated in DMEM supplemented with 2 µg/ml trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. T1426) on the day of the experiment. Antibodies were serially diluted twofold in 50 µl DMEM and then mixed with 100 TCID50 of influenza virus in 50 μl DMEM for 1 h at 37 °C in a cell culture incubator. Positive control wells contained viruses only, while negative control wells contained no viruses. One hour later, the virus-antibody mixture was transferred to MDCK cells and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. After 24 h of infection, the virus-antibody mixture was removed, the cells were washed with PBS and fixed in 80% acetone for 30 min, and viral antigen was detected by ELISA with a polyclonal antibody against NP protein (prepared in our lab) as previously used12. The optical density at 450 nm (OD450) was recorded with a plate reader (Bio-Tek Epoch 2). The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) was analyzed with GraphPad Prism 7.0.Protective efficacy of 28-12 in miceThe animal experiments described in this study were approved and in compliance with the BSL-2 laboratory guidelines of the Institut Pasteur of Shanghai, CAS. For the prophylaxis experiment, 7-week-old female BALB/c mice (n = 5) received 1, 3, 10, or 30 mg/kg 28-12 or PBS buffer via the intraperitoneal (i.p.) route in a 0.2 ml volume 24 h before intranasal challenge with a lethal dose of A/Sichuan/1/2009 (H1N1) or A/Hong Kong/01/1968 (H3N2) virus, respectively. For the therapeutic experiment, the mice (n = 5) were intranasally infected with a lethal dose of viruses 24 h before i.p. administration of 25 mg/kg 28-12 at 0, 1, 2 and 3 days post infection. Mice were weighed and monitored daily for 14 days after influenza virus infection.HA conformational change inhibition assayTo activate HA0 into HA1 and HA2, HK/68 H3 HA-histidine protein (Sino Biological) was mixed with trypsin in PBS buffer at room temperature for 2 h. Trypsin activity was stopped by adding aprotinin (Sigma, cat. A1153). The above mixture was divided into 3 groups and incubated with 28-12, the anti-HCV antibody 8D6, or no antibody in PBS buffer at 37 °C for 2 h. Samples were treated with PBS or buffer with low pH (100 mM sodium acetate, 1% n-dodecyl β-D-maltoside (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no. D4641), pH = 4.8) at 37 °C for 1 h through buffer exchange using Zeba™ Spin Desalting Plates, 7 K MWCO (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. 89882). Samples were neutralized with Tris-HCl (pH 9.0) or PBS to a pH of 8.0. The above samples were mixed with 0.0025 μg trypsin individually and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Samples were then run on a 10% SDS–polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel under nonreducing conditions and blotted using an HRP-conjugated 6x His mouse monoclonal antibody (Proteintech, Cat No. HRP-66005). A GE healthcare ImageQuant LAS4000 mini biomolecular imager was used for the detection and quantitation of chemiluminescence. The conformational change inhibition assay of the SC/09 H1 HA protein (Sino Biological) was performed as described above.Membrane fusion inhibition assayHeLa cells in 12-well plates were transfected with FΜGW plasmids encoding the HA gene fragment of the HK/68 H3 or SC/09 H1 strain using LipofectamineTM2000 transfection reagent. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the HeLa cells were incubated with 28-12, 8D6 (100 μg/ml) or no antibody at 37 °C for 1 h. The supernatants were removed, and the cells were treated with trypsin (2.5 μg/ml) for 10 min at 37 °C to cleave HA0 into HA1 and HA2. After washing twice, the cells were incubated with 28-12, 8D6 or no antibody at 37 °C for 1 h. Afterwards, the supernatants were removed, and the cells were treated with citric acid (pH 4.8) at 37 °C for 10 min. The acidic medium was replaced with DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, and the cells were incubated for 3 h, followed by 4% polyoxymethylene fixation and staining with 0.5% crystal violet. Syncytium formation was observed with the Olympus IX73 inverted microscope and the images were collected by Olympus cellSens Entry software.ELISAThe binding affinity of antibodies to HAs was measured by ELISA. The HA protein (0.5 μg/ml in 100 μl/well) was captured onto a 96-well plate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no. 446469) overnight. The wells were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS at 37 °C for 2 h. Antibodies were serially diluted threefold in blocking buffer (starting from a concentration of 10 μg/ml) and were incubated in the wells at 37 °C for 2 h. The samples were washed three times, and an anti-human Fc HRP antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no. A0170) was used to detect the binding affinity, followed by incubation with tetramethylbenzydine (Beyotime, cat. P0209), and the reaction was stopped by adding 1 M HCl. The absorbance at 450 nm was recorded by a plate reader (Bio-Tek Epoch 2), and the data were analyzed with GraphPad Prism 7.0 software.To evaluate the reactivity between antibodies and peptides, peptides (0.5 μg/ml in 100 μl/well) were captured onto 96-well plates, and ELISA was performed as described above.The antibody binding activity to untreated or denatured HA was measured as described above. The HA protein was denatured with 0.1% SDS, 50 mM DTT and a metal bath at 100 °C for 10 min.Biolayer interferometry (BLI) analysisTo test the binding affinity between 28-12 and different HA proteins, 28-12 (15 µg/mL) was immobilized on an anti-human IgG-Fc-coated biosensor (AHC) surface for 300 s. The baseline interference phase was then read for 180 s in kinetics buffer (KB: 1× PBS), followed by subsequent association phase immersion of the sensors into wells containing two-fold serial dilutions of HA protein (100-50-25-12.5-6.25-3.125 nM) in KB for 600 s. Then, the sensors were immersed in KB for dissociation for up to 600 s. The mean Kon, Koff and apparent KD values were calculated using the global fit to a 1:1 Langmuir binding model with an R2 value of ≥0.95. The data were collected using OCTET DATA acquisition 9.0 and the data were analyzed by Fortebio Data Analysis 9.0.HA mutagenesis and binding measurementsThe DNA sequences encoding the extracellular domain of HA proteins of HK/68 H3 or WA/11 H1 were fused to a C-terminal 8X His tag. Site-directed mutagenesis was induced with a commercialized KOD-Plus mutagenesis kit (TOYOBO). The plasmids were transfected into CHO cells in 12-well plates. The supernatants were harvested 96 h after transfection. ELISA was performed to measure expression of individual HA proteins in the cell supernatant. In brief, the HA head antibody 139/S (H3) or 5j8 (H1) was coated onto a plate, and 20-, 100-, 500-fold dilutions of cell supernatant were then added and captured by the anti-6 X His antibody. Serially diluted purified HA-8 X His was used as a standard, followed by detection with an HRP-conjugated mouse anti-His antibody (Proteintech). The concentration of the sample was calculated according to a standard curve. Another ELISA was performed to analyze the relative binding activities between these HA mutants and 28-12. HA mutants at 200 ng/ml were incubated with plates precoated with 28-12, followed by detection with an HRP-conjugated mouse anti-6 X His antibody. The binding activity of the mutants to 28-12 was compared to that of wild-type HA.Preparation of 28-12 FabPapain (Sigma-Aldrich, cat.no. P4762) was dissolved in PBS with 20 mM L-cysteine to activate papain. Antibody 28-12 was digested with papain at an antibody-to-papain ratio of 200:1 at 37 °C for 6 h. Protease activity was stopped by iodoacetamide (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no. I6125). 28-12 was purified using protein A to remove the Fc region and undigested IgG antibody, followed by 2–3 rounds of dialysis using PBS at 4 °C for 6 h. Size-exclusion gel filtration chromatography was performed to further purify 28–12 Fab.Preparation of 28-12 Fabrimeric HA complexesTrimeric HK/68 H3 and WA/11 H1 HAs were expressed in the insect baculovirus expression system, while 28-12 was expressed in the ExpiTMCHO expression system, as described previously12. Fab 28-12 was mixed with trimeric HA at a Fab-to-monomer HA molar ratio of 2:1 and incubated at 4 °C overnight for complex formation. The Fab-trimeric HA complex was purified by size-exclusion gel filtration chromatography in elution buffer (20 mM Hepes, 50 mM NaCl, pH 8.0), followed by concentrating the complex to 5–6 mg/ml.Cryo-EM sample preparation and data acquisitionTo prepare vitrified samples, the purified 28-12-H1 or 28-12-H3 complex was diluted to 0.5 mg/ml, and a 2 µl aliquot of sample was applied to a plasma-treated holey carbon grid (Quantifoil, R1.2/1.3, 200 mesh). The grid was blotted with a Vitrobot Mark IV (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and then plunged into liquid ethane cooled by liquid nitrogen.The movie stacks for both complexes were collected on a Titan Krios electron microscope (FEI TEM user interface 2.15.3, Thermo Fisher Scientific) operated at an acceleration voltage of 300 kV, with a nominal magnification of 18,000× (yielding a pixel size of 1.318 Å; Supplementary Table 1). The movies were recorded on a K2 Summit direct electron detector (Gatan) operated in super resolution mode under low-dose conditions in an automatic manner using SerialEM37. Each frame was exposed for 0.2 s and the total accumulation time was 7.6 s, leading to a total accumulated dose of 38 e–/Å2 for the specimen.Cryo-EM data processing and 3D reconstructionSingle-particle analysis was mainly executed in Relion38 unless otherwise specified. All images were aligned and summed using MotionCor 2 software39. After CTF parameter determination using CTFFIND40, particle autopicking, manual particle checking, and reference-free 2D classification, particles with 28-12-H3 trimer features remained for further processing.For the 28-12-H3 dataset, 240,827 and 180,686 particles remained after 2D classification for the non-tilt and 40°-tilt micrographs, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 4a). For the tilted data, we used goCTF software to perform per-particle CTF estimation to determine their defocus, and these particles were re-extracted with corrected defocus41. We then combined the particles together and performed one round of refinement. After that, we re-extracted the particles coordinating the refinement result to recenter the particles. We then performed 3D classification, and a class of 191,540 particles with better structural features was selected. After refinement, CTF refinement and Bayesian polishing, the map was refined to 4.1-Å-resolution with imposed C3 symmetry. We then carried out 3D classification, generating a better class with 105, 383 particles. After refinement, we obtained a 3.7-Å-resolution 28-12-H3 map. For this and the following 28-12-H1 cryo-EM maps, the post-process was carried out by DeepEMhacer42, and the resolution estimation was based on the gold-standard Fourier Shell Correlation (FSC) 0.143 criterion, and the local resolution was estimated using Resmap43.For the 28-12-H1 dataset, 403,055 particles remained after 2D classification (Supplementary Fig. 5a). After refinement, we re-extracted and recenter the particles, subsequently performed multiple rounds of 3D classification, leading to a better class with 61% of the particles. We then carried out heterogeneous refinement in cryoSparc44 and a better class with 124,947 particles was selected. We then performed nonuniform refinement in CryoSPARC. After CTF refinement and Bayesian polishing, the structure was refined to 4.1-Å-resolution with imposed C3 symmetry in Relion. We then performed the nonuniform refinement in CryoSPARC using polished particles and obtained a 3.5-Å-resolution cryo-EM map of 28-12-H1.Atomic model buildingWe first built the homology model for the 28-12 Fab through the SWISS-MODEL server45. Since the heavy chain of 28-12 has a particular long CDR3, we used the heavy chain of the VRC 31513-1b02 antibody (PDBID: 5TY6)30 as template, which has a similar CDR3 sequence and shares 83% sequence identity with that of 28-12. For the light chain of Fab 28-12, we used the light chain of the complement C5 antibody (PDBID: 5B71)46 as template, which shares 92% sequence identity with that of 28-12.To generate the atomic model of the 28-12-H3 complex, we first fitted the HK68/H3 X-ray structure (PDBID: 3SDY)47 and the homology model of 28-12 Fab into the 28-12-H3 cryo-EM map as a rigid body using fit in map module in UCSF Chimera48. Afterwards, we refined the model against the corresponding cryo-EM map in Rossetta49, then Phenix50. Furthermore, to improve the fit between the model and map, we performed real space refinement using COOT51. Finally, we used Phenix again for the last round of flexible fitting of the entire complex. For the 28-12-H1 complex, a similar flexible-fitting procedure was applied, except that we used WA11/H1 X-ray structure (PDBID: 5gjt)12 to fit the H1 trimer structure.We used UCSF Chimera and ChimeraX for generating figures and performing electrostatic surface property calculations52,53. Interaction surface analysis was conducted by using the PISA server54.Affinity depletion of anti-H3 peptide 36-57HA2 antibodiesThe collection and study of the 50 vaccinated donors’ sera were approved by the Ethical Review Committee of National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, China CDC. The informed consent was obtained by the participants. Selected synthetic biotinylated H3 peptide 36-57HA2 (Genescript) were added at 150 ng/well to streptavidin-coated plates and incubated at room temperature for 1 h in PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20. The sera were added into the plates and incubated for 20 min at RT for absorption. The unbound antibodies were collected after 24 rounds of absorption. Adsorbed samples were then mixed with HK/68 H3N2 virus for neutralization assay. A non-specific peptide control, OVA, was also included.Polyreactivity of antibodiesTo detect the polyreactivity of mAbs, the ELISA and immunofluorescence-based assays were performed as previously described20. For ELISA-based detection of polyreactivity, plates were coated with poly I:C (15 mg/ml) (Life Technologies), LPS (15 mg/ml) (Sigma), or recombinant human insulin (10 mg/ml) (Sino Biological) in carbonate buffer. Plates were blocked with PBS with 0.05% Tween. Antibodies were serial diluted and incubated on the plate for 1 h at 37 °C followed by detection with goat anti-human IgG Fc at 1:8000. Absorbances were measured at OD450. An influenza antibody CR9114 and an anti-dsDNA antibody 3H9 was used as a positive control. For immunofluorescence-based detection of polyreactivity, HEp-2 cells were plated the day before experiment. HEp-2 cells were fixed with 4% PFA for 10 min followed by permeabilization with 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min. Biotinylated antibodies were incubated with cells for 1 h at the concentration of 50, 10 and 2 μg/ml, respectively and a FITC-linked streptavidin was then incubated with the cells for 1 h. The immunofluorescence was read and analyzed by Operetta (PerkinElmer).Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.

We assess the influenza vaccination rate and its related factors in participants with airflow limitation (AFL) using nationally representative data in Korea. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2007 to 2018. Individuals ≥ 40 years who underwent spirometry and had identifiable information on influenza vaccination status were included. Results: Overall influenza vaccination coverage was 61.2% in participants with AFL and 41.8% in participants without AFL. Age had a significant impact on the yearly vaccination rate in participants with AFL. Over the 10 years of study period, while the yearly vaccination rate steadily increased from 58.3 to 61.9% in elderly participants (≥65 years) with AFL (p for trend = 0.117), the yearly vaccination rate decreased from 41.5% to 30.8% in younger participants (<65 years) (p for trend = 0.038). In multivariable analyses, younger age [adjusted odds ratio (OR) for unvaccinated = 0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.87–0.90], male (adjusted OR = 1.64; 95% CI = 1.23–2.19), and current smokers (adjusted OR = 1.42, 95% CI = 1.01–2.00) were associated with increased odds of being unvaccinated. Conclusions: The vaccination rate in participants with AFL affected by age. Younger age, male sex, and current smoking were associated with unvaccinated status. More attention and targeted interventions are required to improve the influenza vaccination rate in those with AFL. Introduction Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which is a representative disease with airflow limitation (AFL), is the leading causes of death worldwide, with a prevalence of 5.6% in 2015, which is expected to increase to 7.8% by 2030 (1, 2). COPD is a chronic inflammatory airway disease characterized by fixed airflow limitation and chronic respiratory symptoms, such as cough, sputum, and progressive dyspnea. Acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD) can occur during the natural course of disease (3). AECOPD not only affects an individual's physical health status but also decreases lung function and increases future risk of exacerbation and even mortality (4–6). AECOPD also increases medical expense and resource use, causing increased socioeconomic burden (7). AECOPD is a heterogeneous event thought to be caused by complex interactions between the host, respiratory viruses or bacteria, and environmental pollution (8, 9). The most common causes of AECOPD are respiratory infections, most of which are viral. Although the most frequent viruses associated with exacerbation are human rhinoviruses (8), influenza is also important, accounting for up to 28% of COPD exacerbations (10). Influenza can lead to hospitalization, frequent exacerbation, and even death in patients with COPD (11, 12). The disease course of influenza is worse in patients with COPD compared with those without COPD. Influenza vaccination is the main strategy for prevention and control of seasonal influenza (13). The influenza vaccination has been shown to reduce AECOPD, influenza-related hospitalization, and mortality (14, 15). Thus, seasonal influenza vaccination is recommended to stable COPD patients from groups A to D classified by combining exacerbation history and severity of dyspnea suggested by Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) (16). Despite this recommendation, it is not known whether influenza vaccination coverage has increased among COPD patients because most studies evaluated vaccination rates for a certain year (17–20). Such information is even scarcer within the past 10 years (21). In addition to COPD, influenza vaccination should be considered in relation to other respiratory diseases including asthma and bronchiectasis. A previous meta-analysis found that influenza vaccination reduced febrile illnesses and prevented asthma attacks requiring emergency visits and hospitalizations (22). Despite limited studies regarding the efficacy of influenza vaccination in bronchiectasis, international bronchiectasis guidelines strongly recommend influenza vaccination in patients with bronchiectasis (23, 24). Consequently, more studies are needed to evaluate the factors associated with influenza vaccination coverage among individuals with AFL to develop ways to encourage vaccination and improve their health outcomes. In this study, we measure the influenza vaccination rate among participants with AFL in a nationally representative sample of Korea, and assess factors associated with influenza vaccination. Methods Study Population For this study, cross-sectional data were used from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES), which provides nationwide statistical data on the Korean population's health and diet from January 2007 to December 2018. The questionnaire on the influenza vaccination was investigated for only 3 months in 2013 and was not disclosed to the public; thus, data from 2013 were not included in this study. The KNHANES uses a complex, stratified, multistage probability cluster sampling design with sampling units of households based on geographic region, age, and gender. A health-related interview, nutrition survey, and physical examination were performed for each participant selected throughout Korea by trained interviewers. All participants agreed to participate in this study. Since publicly available data were used, ethical approval was waived. The KNHANES surveys were approved by the relevant institutional review boards, and informed consent was provided by all participants. Because spirometry is only performed in individuals older than 40 years, we only included participants ≥40 years in the analyses. Participants who did not undergo spirometry and those who had missing data for influenza vaccination were excluded from the study. Of the total 38,247 participants, influenza vaccination data were available for 34,464, of whom 4,873 (14.1%) had AFL on spirometry and 29,591 (85.9%) did not. Finally, this study included 4,873 participants with AFL, comprising those without influenza vaccination (n = 1,890) and those with influenza vaccination (n = 2,983) (Figure 1). FIGURE 1 Figure 1. Selection of study population. AFL, airflow limitation; KNHANES, Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Exposure The main exposure variable was influenza vaccination, which was determined by the response to a question about influenza vaccination status during the previous 1 year: “Have you been vaccinated for influenza during the previous 1 year?” Study Outcomes The study outcomes were (1) influenza vaccination rate according to presence or absence of AFL during the study period; (2) influenza vaccination rate in participants with AFL stratified by age and AFL severity; and (3) factors associated with vaccination status in participants with AFL. To reduce the disease burden of influenza, the Korean government instituted a national immunization program in 2005, which provides free influenza vaccination for people aged ≥ 65 years. Accordingly, we divided subjects into two age groups (65 years or older vs. under 65 years). AFL was defined as spirometry revealing forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC) <0.7. Severity of AFL was classified according to the percentage of the predicted FEV1 (% pred): mild (FEV1 %pred of >70), moderate (FEV1 %pred of 60–69), moderately severe (FEV1 %pred of 50–59), severe (FEV1 %pred of 35–49), and very severe (FEV1 %pred of <35) (25). Covariates The KNHANES provides various demographic data [age, sex, body mass index (BMI), education level, marital status, and self-perceived income status] and spirometry results. The Korean version of the EuroQol-5 dimensions questionnaire (EQ-5D), a simple health-related quality of life instrument consisting of 5 health dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression), was used to measure QoL status (26, 27). Several comorbid conditions were also included in this study. The presence of hypertension was determined by high blood pressure (mean systolic blood pressure ≥140 mmHg or mean diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mmHg on examination or current intake of antihypertensive medications). Hypercholesterolemia was defined as total cholesterol >200 mg/dL or current intake of lipid-lowering medications (28). Diabetes was defined as fasting glucose >126 mg/dL or HbA1c >6.5% or current use of oral hypoglycemic agents or insulin for glycemic control (29). The presence of other comorbid conditions was determined by a positive response to the following two questions: “Have you been diagnosed with [disease] by a doctor?” or “Do you take medicine or treatment for [disease]?” (30). Statistical Analyses Data are presented as medians and interquartile ranges for continuous variables and as frequencies (percentages) for categorical variables. Data were compared using the Mann–Whitney U test for continuous variables because of non-normality. Continuous variables were compared using Pearson's chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test, as appropriate. For the analyses of influenza vaccination rate by AFL severity and multivariable logistic regression to evaluate factors associated with not receiving influenza vaccination, we classified the severity of AFL into four groups [mild (FEV1 %pred of >70), moderate (FEV1 %pred of 60–69), moderately severe (FEV1 %pred of 50–59), and severe to very severe (FEV1 %pred of <50)] because there only 1.3% of participants (n = 64) had severe to very severe AFL (FEV1 %pred of <50) in the NHANES dataset. In the multivariable logistic regression model, we adjusted for age, sex, BMI, marital status, type of medical insurance, economic activity, education level, EQ-5D, chronic bronchitis, smoking history, the severity of AFL, comorbidities (hypertension, ischemic heart disease, diabetes mellitus, and asthma). All tests were two-sided, and a p-value ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were performed using STATA software (ver. 16; StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA). Results Influenza Vaccination Rate According to Presence of Airflow Limitation Influenza vaccination trends from 2007 to 2018 are shown in Figure 2. Compared to 61.2% of participants with AFL (2,983/4,873) being vaccinated, 41.8% participants without AFL (12,357/29,591) were vaccinated. FIGURE 2 Figure 2. Influenza vaccination trends in participants with AFL. AFL, airflow limitation. Figure 3 shows the influenza vaccination trends according to AFL status based on age. While the overall vaccination rate in participants 65 years or older was ~80% (Figure 3A), the vaccination rate in participants younger than 65 years was <40% (Figure 3B). AFL had a significantly different impact on the age-stratified vaccination rate. In participants 65 years or older, the overall vaccination rate (80.2% with AFL vs. 80.3% without AFL; p = 0.894) was not different by AFL. Regardless of AFL, the yearly vaccination rate steadily increased during the study period [58.3% in 2007 to 61.9% in 2018 (p for trend = 0.117) in participants with AFL; 40.2% in 2007 to 44.7% in 2018 (p for trend < 0.001) in participants without AFL; Figure 3A]. FIGURE 3 Figure 3. Influenza vaccination trends according to age (≥65 vs. <65 years). AFL, airflow limitation. (A) Age ≥ 65 years, (B) Age <65 years. AFL, airflow limitation. However, among individuals 65 years or less, the vaccination rate was higher in participants with AFL than in those without AFL (34.7% with AFL vs. 29.2% without AFL; p < 0.001). Additionally, while there was a decreasing trend in the yearly vaccination rate among participants with AFL, the vaccination rate in subjects without AFL fluctuated [41.5% in 2007 to 30.8% in 2018 (p for trend = 0.038) for participants with AFL; 28.6% in 2007 to 29.9% in 2018 (p for trend < 0.001) in participants without AFL; Figure 3B]. Comparison of Clinical Features in Participants With AFL According to Influenza Vaccination Differences in clinical characteristics according to influenza vaccination status in participants with AFL are presented in Table 1. Vaccinated participants tended to be older and were less likely to be male and current smokers compared with unvaccinated participants (p < 0.001 for both). Regarding socioeconomics, vaccinated participants had lower economic activity and lower QoL compared with unvaccinated participants (p < 0.001 for both). Comorbid conditions including hypertension, ischemic heart disease, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, cerebrovascular disease, asthma, and osteoporosis were more common among vaccinated participants than unvaccinated participants. Except for FEV1 % predicted, vaccinated participants had lower lung function parameters [FEV1 (L), FVC (L), FVC % pred, and FEV1/FVC] compared with unvaccinated participants (p < 0.001 for the latter four variables). TABLE 1 Table 1. Comparison of clinical features in participants with airflow limitation according to influenza vaccination. Influenza Vaccination Rate According to AFL Severity Influenza vaccination rate was further analyzed according to AFL severity. The overall vaccination rates were 59.8% (2,027/3,392), 61.7% (484/784), 66.6% (273/410), and 69.3% (199/287) in participants with mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe to very severe AFL subjects, respectively (Figure 4; p = 0.001). FIGURE 4 Figure 4. Influenza vaccination rate according to AFL severity. AFL, airflow limitation. Factors Related to Non-vaccination in Participants With AFL As shown in Table 2, in multivariable analyses, younger age [adjusted odds ratio (OR) for being unvaccinated = 0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.87–0.90], male (adjusted OR = 1.70; 95% CI = 1.21–2.42), and current smoking (adjusted OR = 1.42, 95% CI = 1.01–2.00) were associated with increased odds for being unvaccinated. Although participants with more severe AFL were more likely to be vaccinated according to the univariable analysis, the severity of AFL was not related to vaccination status in multivariable analyses. TABLE 2 Table 2. Factors associated with non-vaccination against influenza in participants with airflow limitation. Discussion This study evaluated influenza vaccination trends from 2007 and 2018 among participants with AFL in Korea. During the study period, the overall influenza vaccination rate was higher in participants with AFL than in those without AFL. While the influenza vaccination rate in the elderly with AFL steadily increased similar to that of those without AFL, the rate in young participants with AFL decreased, while the rate among young participants without AFL fluctuated. In multivariable analyses, younger age, male, and current smoking were associated with increased odds of unvaccinated status. Influenza vaccination has been considered as important management in individuals with chronic airway diseases with AFL, such as COPD, asthma, and bronchiectasis. The current guidelines strongly recommend influenza vaccination in COPD. Influenza vaccination is known to reduce not only acute exacerbations but also serious lower respiratory infections in COPD participants. The benefits of influenza vaccination in participants with COPD extend beyond the prevention of respiratory illness. Studies have shown that influenza vaccination can reduce mortality and risk of ischemic heart disease, especially in the elderly (31). Furthermore, chronic comorbidities are highly prevalent in patients with COPD and are associated with frequent exacerbations and increased risk of exacerbation (32). Hence, influenza vaccination should be emphasized in patients with AFL and other comorbidities. The vaccination rate in patients with COPD varies widely by country. While the rates of influenza vaccination in patients with COPD were relatively high in the US (~64%) (21), Spain (~60%) (17, 18), and Korea (~60% in this study), the vaccination rate was relatively low in Hungary (24%) (19), Taiwan (32%) (33), and Turkey (40%) (20). Unfortunately, few studies have evaluated influenza vaccination coverage within a specific country. In our study, the influenza vaccination rate was relatively stable, suggesting more effort is needed to increase coverage in patients with COPD in Korea. Because the current data suggest that vaccination rates can vary widely, we suggest that studies evaluating vaccination rates over time would be informative to set country-specific vaccination strategies for COPD patients. Regarding asthma, a previous meta-analysis demonstrated influenza vaccination reduced febrile illness by 72% and prevented 59–78% of cases of acute exacerbation of asthma requiring emergency visits and/or hospitalizations (22), suggesting influenza vaccination could be a cost-effective strategy to reduce acute exacerbation of asthma. Although there is limited evidence directly showing the effectiveness of vaccination in patients with bronchiectasis, influenza virus may play a crucial role in triggering exacerbation of bronchiectasis (34), which supports providing influenza vaccination to this population (23, 24). However, to provide solid evidence for influenza vaccination in patients with bronchiectasis, future studies evaluating the role of influenza vaccination in bronchiectasis are needed. Importantly, our study results suggested whom clinicians should persuade to receive influenza vaccination, which includes younger patients, males, and current smokers. As shown in previous studies, the vaccination rate was significantly lower in the younger population with AFL than in the older population with AFL (17, 20, 21, 33, 35). Additionally, younger age was independently associated with unvaccinated status in participants with AFL. Beyond this, we further performed a trend analysis for vaccination over 10 years according to age group, which has not been performed in previous studies. While the vaccination rate in elderly subjects with AFL had a steadily increasing trend, the rate showed a decreasing trend. The reasons for this phenomenon are not clear. For a possible reason, young participants with AFL are likely to have unhealthy lifestyles, while their symptoms are mild or absent in the early stage of AFL. Accordingly, the importance of influenza vaccination is likely to be neglected in this population. This information suggests the importance of age in predicting influenza vaccination in those with AFL. We need to pay more attention to increasing the vaccination rate in the young population with AFL. Consistent with previous studies, our study revealed that males and current smokers are more likely to be unvaccinated among participants with AFL. Generally, males are more likely to be current smokers than females, especially in Asian countries, including Korea (30). Furthermore, being a male and a smoker increases the risk of severe disease presentation, including mortality (36–38). Thus, it is plausible that such male patients who also have AFL have a much higher risk of worse prognosis than those without these risk factors. However, our study results alone cannot explain sex differences in vaccination rates. We believe that an unhealthy lifestyle in men may have influenced this observation. Additionally, there is a possibility that women might be more compliant with clinicians' recommendations for influenza vaccination than men, as shown by the sex difference in medication adherence in Korea (39). There have been conflicting results on the relationship between AFL severity and influenza vaccination rate. While a lower rate of vaccination was observed in subjects with more severe AFL (17), other studies showed a positive association between AFL severity and influenza vaccination rate (18–20). Similarly, our study showed a positive association between AFL severity and vaccination rate, although it diminished after adjustment of covariables. Given that severe AFL can be associated with severe pneumonia in patients with AFL (40), and the protective effects of influenza vaccination seem to be correlated with AFL severity (13), strategies focusing on improving the vaccination rate in patients with severe AFL might be more cost-effective. Our findings yield important insights that can be helpful to design targeted strategies to increase influenza vaccination coverage in patients with AFL. The identification of factors (younger age, male, and current smokers) associated with unvaccinated status can help design tailored strategies to increase influenza vaccination in patients with AFL. We also suggest a change in strategy of influenza vaccination policy for adults in Korea. Currently, the Korean government-led free influenza vaccination policy for adults is a one-size-fits-all strategy that is applied to all subjects aged 65 or older, and it does not consider risk factors other than age. Thus, a large number of young patients with AFL who are at a high risk of influenza have not been considered for the benefit of government-led free vaccination programs. However, given the broad benefits of influenza infection on respiratory diseases with AFL, a more advanced and personalized free vaccination strategy that estimates individual risk might be helpful, and it could include young patients with AFL. There are limitations to our study that should be acknowledged. First, this study was performed in Korea, limiting the generalizability of our findings. Second, because KNHANES does not have data on post-bronchodilator spirometry, we defined AFL using pre-bronchodilator spirometry. However, prebronchodilator spirometry has been widely used to define AFL in many previous studies of COPD epidemiology (30, 41, 42). Third, this study could not evaluate the presence of bronchiectasis, which may be an important comorbidity to consider when interpreting the results of our study. This was because a questionnaire on bronchiectasis was only available in the 2007–2009 NHANES dataset. Fourth, we could not provide a reasonable explanation for our observation of the relationship between socioeconomic and influenza vaccination status in participants with AFL. Poor socioeconomic status, such as low education level, inactive economic status, and reduced QoL, showed increased odds of non-vaccination in the univariable analysis but no significant relationship in multivariable analyses. Although the reasons are not clear, it is possible that the Korean government-led free influenza vaccination program attenuated the influence of these factors on influenza vaccination. The free influenza vaccination program in Korea targets people receiving Medicaid and the elderly population whose socioeconomic status and QoL are poor, which leads to disproportionally higher influenza vaccination rates in these subjects despite their poor socioeconomic status. Thus, the simultaneous consideration of these factors (age, Medicaid, economic activity, educational level, and QoL) might have yielded the non-significance of socioeconomic variables. As socioeconomic status and government health policies might differ between countries, our study results should be interpreted with caution in other countries. In conclusion, over the past 10 years, the influenza vaccination rate in elderly participants with AFL steadily increased, while the rate in younger participants with AFL decreased. Younger participants, males, and current smokers were most likely to have unvaccinated status among those with AFL. More attention and targeted interventions are required to improve the influenza vaccination rate in individuals with AFL.

By late April, federal data showed a nearly seven per cent test positivity rate, close to the average level for this time of year and largely driven by a spike in Quebec. Do you have a coronavirus question or news tip for CBC News? Email us at ask@cbc.ca. This unusually late flu season may offer clues for how COVID and influenza will impact each other in the years ahead, with one theory suggesting these two rival viruses could ebb and flow — but it's tough to predict what, exactly, that would look like."It'll be interesting to see what happens as COVID gets less dominant, if influenza starts to compete with it, and they have a tug of war over the next couple of years," said Dr. Sumon Chakrabarti, an infectious diseases specialist with Trillium Health Partners in Mississauga, Ont.Flu typically spikes in winterIn a typical flu year, cases first rise in the fall, spike in the winter and taper off in the spring, with sporadic infections throughout the rest of the year — with influenza A viruses circulating before influenza B.The viruses' disappearance throughout the pandemic might be tied, in part, to shifts in behaviour throughout much of the last two years as COVID-19 surged unpredictably, variant after variant."We were able to successfully suppress influenza circulation with our other public measures related to COVID-19," said Dr. Danuta Skowronski, the epidemiology lead for influenza and emerging respiratory pathogens at the BC Centre for Disease Control.Second OpinionWhat could 'COVID season' actually look like?The lifting of restrictions, coupled with a rise in global and domestic travel, likely played a role in influenza returning in recent months, said Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious diseases specialist at the University Health Network in Toronto.A mismatched flu vaccine this season may be another factor behind this unusual spike, as U.S. public health authorities reported, or simply waning immunity from shots given back in the fall, according to Skowronski.But some close COVID-19 watchers say the virus that causes it, SARS-CoV-2, may also have helped keep influenza at bay.A sign indicating the estimated wait time at Humber River Hospital is pictured in its emergency department in Toronto on April 26. The hospital is facing higher patient volumes, and a rise in flu cases. (Alex Lupul/CBC)'Viral interference'There was once speculation that COVID-19 and flu could create what some dubbed a "twindemic," with both types of infections hitting countries at once, but those fears haven't materialized. Instead, some medical experts say there could be some level of "viral interference," in which a virus such as SARS-CoV-2 pushes out other pathogens at a population level for a period of time. Cold and flu medication in short supply at some Ontario pharmacies"There's some type of interesting viral suppression and competition going on here," said Chakrabarti, who suggested COVID and flu may ebb and flow in circulation.Throughout the pandemic, he explained, widespread COVID-19 infections may have kept people's immune systems on high alert, giving SARS-CoV-2 a long-term advantage over the flu.Influenza A cases began rising in Canada unusually late this year, following the lifting of public health restrictions and when more Canadians began mingling and travelling. (Alex Lupul/CBC)"There were flu outbreaks this year, mostly in pockets of the United States, but still it clearly wasn't a regular flu season and influenza was clearly suppressed," echoed Bogoch."Now, people talk about viral interference with influenza and COVID and I wouldn't ignore anything. I think the short answer is you can't get overconfident with how the next year or so is going to play out."Is it COVID or a cold? How to know as Omicron cases riseOn the flip side, virologist Alyson Kelvin of the University of Saskatchewan's Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization said the sudden return of influenza may actually be tied to millions of Canadians' immunity being dulled by the fifth and sixth COVID-19 waves — not sharpened by a COVID-19 infection."The circulation of SARS-CoV-2 — specifically Omicron — may have left people slightly immunocompromised," she said. "After the virus comes in and infects people, their immune system is weaker, leaving an opportunity for Influenza A to infect people in the weeks following their initial Omicron infection."WATCH | Canadians urged to get boosters during 6th wave: Canadians urged to get COVID-19 booster shots to blunt 6th wave3 years agoDuration 2:00All signs indicate Canada is going through a sixth pandemic wave, Dr. Theresa Tam confirms. Her message to Canadians: wear a mask and get boosted if eligible.Different pattern of influenza possibleSeveral experts who spoke to CBC News did agree there could be unexpected shifts in the influenza season based on how the virus behind COVID-19 operates going forward."Will SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 cases become more seasonal? If so, we might see a different pattern of influenza cases," Kelvin said.Second OpinionAlmost half of Canadians may have caught COVIDIn the short term — more reassuringly — both viruses are expected to fade away as the weather warms up before returning, at some point, in the fall.This lull period is the time when health-care systems and governments need to start planning for an uncertain future, according to Dr. Leon Rivlin, chief of emergency medicine at Humber River Hospital.Dr. Leon Rivlin, chief of emergency medicine at Humber River Hospital, inside the emergency department in late April. He is bracing for an uptick in the number of COVID-19 cases. (Alex Lupul/CBC)Right now, as flu cases are ticking up, hospitals are still facing staffing shortages tied to COVID-19, he said. On his team, seven physicians called in sick for suspected SARS-CoV-2 infections just last weekend. "We're going to have this upsurge again," he warned. "And once again, we're going to be strained for human resources."As Quebecers consider weekend holiday gatherings, COVID-19 and flu could spoil the partyThe months ahead could be crucial to ensure Canadians continue getting vaccinations that offer protection against severe illnesses, while policy makers ensure there's adequate space and staff to handle patients who do fall seriously ill with COVID-19 or flu."There's going to be both short-term and long-term solutions," Chakrabarti said. "Ultimately, we need some type of way to absorb any sudden surge of infections that occurs."ABOUT THE AUTHORLauren PelleySenior Health & Medical ReporterLauren Pelley covers the global spread of infectious diseases, pandemic preparedness and the crucial intersection between health and climate change.

"More than 28 million laying hens have been culled as a result of the bird flu — that's nearly 9% of the total flock," according to Karyn Rispoli, an egg market reporter at commodity research firm Urner Barry. "When the outbreaks first started, the jump in wholesale values was being driven primarily by demand, as there was a bit of panic and short covering going on in the marketplace. But at this point, so much production has been removed from the landscape that it's more of a supply-side issue," Rispoli said in an email. Carried by free-flying waterfowl — such as ducks, geese and shorebirds, and infecting chickens, turkeys, pheasants, quail, domestic ducks, geese and guinea fowl — the outbreaks are pushing up the price of two commodities that are daily fixtures in the American diet. "The chicken and the egg really have a strong position in our daily consumption. The supply goes down and the price will go up," Kathleen Liang, a professor of sustainable agriculture at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, told CBS MoneyWatch. Cost of eggs on the rise due to inflation and deadly bird flu 02:33 Avian flu continues to spread, especially in flocks of egg-laying hens, economist Lee Schulz, an associate professor at Iowa State University wrote in a blog post. When the flu hits, some birds die and others must be euthanized. That reduces the supply of eggs, a commodity for which there are few substitutes, he explained. "Outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) continue to impact the table egg industry, especially in the egg products sector where nearly three-fourths of the outbreaks have occurred," the U.S. Department of Agriculture wrote last week in a report.Nationally, the average price of Grade A large eggs last week was $1.66 a dozen, up 12% from the prior week and nearly 73% from last year, according to the USDA. Meantime, shoppers are paying about 5% more for whole chickens than a year ago, making poultry a relative bargain given grocery prices overall are 10% higher and the price of beef is up 16%, federal data shows. "The chicken and the eggs are just the beginning of the ripple effect," Liang said. "The downstream industries are the ones absorbing the higher costs." Salad dressing, cake mix and chipsThe cost of processed eggs — used in liquid or powdered form in manufactured products including salad dressing, cake mix and chips — has also surged, adding to inflationary pressures. Breaker eggs, which are sold in liquid form to wholesale bakeries and large restaurant chains, were on Tuesday priced at $2.58 a pound, according to Urner Barry. "That's up from 86 cents a pound at the start of March, shortly after the first outbreak was confirmed," noted Rispoli, who added that at this time last year breaker egg prices ran at 49 cents a pound.Back when the avian flu outbreak had affected 24 states and some 24 million commercial birds, only eight cases had been confirmed in commercial broiler chickens. More than 60% of U.S. broiler production occurs in six states: Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina and Texas. So far, just North Carolina and Texas have had outbreaks. "Sick birds will never make it to the market," said Liang of the potential for a significant reduction in supply, depending on whether the outbreaks are contained. "Demand is strong and supply is limited." As avian influenza spreads, the turkey industry has also been impacted, with production estimates for the year revised lower by 150 million pounds, the USDA said in an April analysis. Whole-hen frozen turkey prices were reported at $1.31 a pound in the first quarter, up 19% from 2021. "With lower forecast production due to HPAI, prices are expected to continue to rise at a more rapid rate in 2022," the agency said.People should expect food inflation to continue this year and next, according to BofA Securities analyst Alexander Lin, who expects food prices to rise about 9% this year and another 4% in 2023. Low health risk to peopleIn Colorado, a prisoner tested positive for avian flu after working at a commercial poultry farm as part of a pre-release employment program, the state said Thursday. The only other known human case was reported in the U.K. late last year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The public health risk related to bird flu remains low, according to the CDC. Still, cooking all poultry and eggs to an internal temperature of 165 ˚F is advised as a general food safety rule.The USDA is investigating a vaccine to fight the flu, which killed more than 50 million chickens and turkeys between 2014 and 2015 and caused economic losses of $3.3 billion, the agency estimates.

Also known as ‘bird flu,’ avian influenza is a respiratory disease which naturally occurs in wild birds throughout the world. It is common for migratory waterfowl such as ducks, gulls, geese, and shorebirds to carry and spread these viruses. Currently, transmission from birds to humans is rare and cases in humans have been relatively mild in nature. There is no evidence to suggest that the consumption of cooked poultry or eggs could transmit avian influenza to humans. It is considered safe to hunt, handle, and eat healthy wild birds in the NWT. The following precautions are important when hunting or handling birds. Wild birds Wear gloves when handling birds you’ve harvested. Process harvested birds in a well-ventilated area. Wash your hands and disinfect your equipment when you’re done. Cook your meat to the recommended temperatures (to an internal temperature of at least 165 °F/74 °C). Never touch birds or other wildlife that appear sick or are found dead. Report any sick or dead birds immediately to your regional Environment and Natural Resources office. Symptoms of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza in wild birds may include: Unusual behaviour, tremors, or lack of coordination Swelling around the head, neck, and eyes Lack of energy or movement Coughing, difficulty breathing, or sneezing Diarrhea Sudden death Birds kept for agricultural purposes Prevent contact of domestic birds (including their food and water) with wild birds and other animals. Limit exposure of domestic birds to visitors. Clean your clothing and footwear, coops, waterers, and feeders regularly. Limit distribution of live birds, eggs, and other bird products outside of your household. If any of your birds begin showing signs of illness, call your veterinarian for an assessment. If you suspect a bird in your flock is positive for avian flu, contact the Canadian Food Inspection Agency by calling +1 403-338-5225. If you must handle sick poultry, wear protective gear, and wash your hands with soap and water. Wash any clothes before contact with healthy domestic poultry. Symptoms of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza in domestic birds may include: A drop in production of eggs, many of which are soft-shelled or shell-less Diarrhea Hemorrhages on the hock High and sudden mortality rate Quietness and extreme depression Swelling of the skin under the eyes Wattles and combs become swollen and congested Precautions for you Never touch wild or domestic birds that appear sick or are found dead. Observe healthy birds from a distance. If you are hunting wild birds, wear gloves and wash hands frequently while dressing them. Disinfect any surfaces and equipment that may be contaminated with saliva, mucous, or feces from wild or domestic birds. Clean with hot, soapy water and then use a household disinfectant. Wash any contaminated clothes right away. Symptoms of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza in humans may include: fever cough nasal congestion shortness of breath sore throat joint aches headache eye redness weakness muscle aches Rare symptoms may include: diarrhea nausea vomiting seizures If you develop symptoms and may have been exposed If you are experiencing any symptoms, and have been in contact with wild birds or domestic birds showing signs of illness, contact your local health centre for assessment and advise them of your bird exposure. Wear a mask when around others, use healthy respiratory practices, and perform frequent hand hygiene until further guidance is provided from a health care professional.

During one game in mid-April, a woman glued her hand to the court. A few days later, another woman chained herself to the goal post. The following week, a third woman, dressed as a referee, stormed the court before removing her jacket, exposing a shirt underneath that read “Glen Taylor roasts animals alive.” The protests, coordinated by the animal rights group Direct Action Everywhere, were aimed at the Timberwolves’ majority owner Glen Taylor. Taylor also owns Rembrandt Enterprises, a large Iowa egg producer that has culled — meaning deliberately killed — 5.3 million of its hens in response to a widespread bird flu outbreak (and then laid off nearly all of its staff).Alicia Santurio disrupted a Minnesota Timberwolves basketball game in April, protesting the team’s owner, Glen Taylor, who also owns an Iowa egg farm that culled 5.3 million chickens in response to a bird flu outbreak. Carlos Gonzalez/Star Tribune via Getty ImagesThe virus, known as the Eurasian H5N1 avian influenza, began tearing through Europe, Asia, and Africa in late 2021 and is still raging, with Europe experiencing its worst bird flu outbreak on record. It was first detected in the US in January and has since spread to at least 32 states, resulting in the death of more than 36 million chickens and turkeys and triggering a spike in egg prices.While the virus has a near 100 percent mortality rate among infected poultry — and can spread rapidly among birds, especially in packed industrial farming conditions — it’s currently believed to pose little threat to human beings. It only rarely spills over to people, and only to those who come into close contact with infected birds. Even when there are human infections, “the viruses are unable to efficiently transmit between humans,” notes Michelle Wille, a virus ecologist at the University of Sydney. But when certain strains of avian flu do manage to infect humans, it can be deadly. From 2003 to 2021, a little more than half of the 863 people who contracted an earlier strain of H5N1 died. The H5N1 strain currently spreading appears to be less transmissible and less severe to humans than those that infected people in the past, and only two people have tested positive for the strain — a man in the United Kingdom last December, and a man in Colorado last week.The Colorado man — a prison inmate who had come in direct contact with presumably infected birds while working at a culling operation as part of a pre-release work program — experienced a few days of fatigue and recovered after being treated with an antiviral drug. Around 10 people who came into contact with him are under close observation. Beyond the occasional one-off case in close human contacts, the bigger worry is that an unchecked flu that spreads among birds has plenty of opportunities to mutate in a way that allows it to transmit efficiently from person to person, thereby kicking off a new influenza pandemic. A widespread bird flu outbreak in 2005 raised alarm bells and prompted the US Senate to allocate $4 billion to prepare for a possible influenza pandemic — though when a new flu pandemic did break out in 2009, the origin was ultimately found in a swine virus.So far, the bird flu has mostly been a problem for birds. It’s not the disease that’s killing most of them, however — it’s their owners. When chicken, turkey, and egg companies detect one infected bird, they kill the whole flock in an effort to slow the spread of the virus. And they’re doing so using a variety of excruciating methods, including spraying birds with a suffocating water-based foam or closing off barn vents to raise temperatures so the birds die by heat stroke, a practice called ventilation shutdown, which can take 1.5 to 3.75 hours to kill them.USDA APHIS“It’s horrendous,” says Craig Watts, a former large-scale chicken farmer and currently a director of field operations for the Socially Responsible Agriculture Project, a nonprofit that advocates against industrial livestock operations. “I’ve been in those houses when the power went out and the generator didn’t kick on. In just a few minutes [the heat] is unbearable. … I can’t imagine that going on for hours and hours.”According to the Storm Lake Times, a newspaper based near Rembrandt’s operation, the company used ventilation shutdown plus, or VSD+, meaning they also pumped heat into their barns to kill the birds faster, a practice being employed in several states. Rembrandt Enterprises did not respond to a request for comment. The situation is horrific, but given the industrialized nature of the US poultry industry and its response to past bird flu outbreaks, animal advocates say it’s unsurprising. Nearly all birds raised for meat and eggs in the US are raised on factory farms, where producers raise hundreds of thousands to millions of animals per year. And most of these animals are genetically identical, which could make them more vulnerable to bird flu. Some experts say the intensification of animal farming — raising more animals closer together — could also be increasing the virulence and transmission rate of bird flu strains.Dena Jones of the Animal Welfare Institute says the 2014-2015 bird flu outbreak in the US, which led to the culling of more than 50 million animals — the largest cull in US history — didn’t prompt any real change in the industry. Instead, mega operations that raise millions of birds per year are continuing to be built across the country, from Oregon to Wisconsin and West Virginia to North Carolina as US chicken and egg consumption rises.Sign up for the Meat/Less newsletter courseWant to eat less meat but don’t know where to start?

There’s also a race to create an effective bird flu vaccine that could be used to slow the spread of future outbreaks, a race the USDA is partially funding. Considering the speed at which bird flu spreads among commercial poultry flocks, and how painful it is for infected birds, the industry has no choice but to mass cull. But the USDA’s approval of ventilation shutdown in 2015 and the rise of its use in recent years, combined with the slow pace of vaccine approval and adoption, mean that for the time being, the birds themselves will continue to receive little consideration in the fight against bird flu. The ongoing expansion and intensification of US animal agriculture, along with a rise in animal disease outbreaks, might also mean that we need to learn how to live with the bird flu and the looming threat it poses.Bird flu spread, explainedMigratory waterfowl, like ducks, geese, and terns, are the natural hosts of highly pathogenic avian influenza strains, but can largely — though not always — carry and spread the virus without showing symptoms.Wild birds rarely come into direct contact with farmed chickens and turkeys, most of which are raised in large indoor barns — especially in more developed economies — but instead spread the virus when their fecal droppings, saliva, or nasal secretions contaminate animal feed or land on surfaces like farmworkers’ clothing or farm equipment. Researchers say the global poultry trade also contributes to the worldwide spread of the bird flu through the import and export of infected poultry.Once any birds test positive for the virus, the whole flock is culled, as the flu can quickly spread to the tens of thousands of other hens, chickens, or turkeys in a single farm. And the flu itself is agonizing for infected poultry. Chickens have trouble breathing and suffer from extreme diarrhea, and sometimes develop swelling around their head, neck, or eyes. Turkeys’ wings can become paralyzed and they might experience tremors. A turkey farm in Illinois in 2019. Over the last few months, millions of chickens and turkeys have been culled — primarily at large-scale farms — to slow the spread of the bird flu. Daniel Acker/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesBird flu outbreaks have been recorded in commercial poultry flocks since at least the 19th century, but the frequency accelerated — and became a bigger issue in the poultry industry — starting in 1997, when an outbreak of H5N1 in Hong Kong chicken farms led to 18 infections in people, six of whom died. Officials responded by culling all 1.3 million chickens in Hong Kong in the winter of 1997-98. Since then, outbreaks have occurred around the world every few years.And not much beyond mass culling can be done to slow the spread once it starts. Adel Talaat, a professor of microbiology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, says we should improve disease surveillance and farm biosecurity to help prevent new outbreaks and slow the spread, but a vaccine that could reliably reduce transmission would go a long way. At the moment, there aren’t any highly effective vaccines on the market, but Talaat is working to develop one using a database of thousands of avian influenza antigens to create a “composite” vaccine that he hopes will protect against current and future virus strains. “Our job is to try to stop this cycle of transmission,” Talaat says. “Because if you stop the cycle of transmission you will be able to basically stop the mutation and stop the replication of the virus.”Adel Talaat, a professor of microbiology at University of Wisconsin-Madison, is developing a bird flu vaccine he hopes can be used to slow the spread of future bird flu outbreaks. Jeff Miller/UW-MadisonHe estimates it could take up to five years until he completes his work and hopefully receives USDA approval, and says a mass vaccination program in the early phase of a bird flu outbreak could be effective at slowing the spread of the virus.“In a big country [like the US], once we start seeing any one case, we know it’s going to go throughout the states — state by state — so we really should start an aggressive campaign for vaccination right away,” Talaat says.Aside from the ineffectiveness of currently available bird flu vaccines, they’re also made in such a way that it’s impossible to distinguish vaccinated, non-infected birds from infected birds. And because no country wants to import meat from potentially infected birds, the vaccines have been a non-starter. Talaat hopes his vaccine will solve this long-standing problem. A spokesperson with the National Turkey Federation told Vox over email that the trade group “supports vaccine development and believes it can be done relatively quickly. However, World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) rules impose severe trade penalties for vaccine use, and we are encouraging USDA to work aggressively for a change in those rules.”“Decisions on vaccinations require many data and we’re investigating an avian influenza vaccine that could distinguish from the wild-type virus,” Rick Coker, a USDA spokesperson, said over email. “We do not have a time frame on any potential vaccine or how it would be used.” There are also efforts underway to create a gene-edited chicken breed immune to bird flu. But for now, the primary way to prevent the flu from killing poultry is by killing poultry. Toward less cruel culling methodsDuring the 2014-2015 bird flu outbreak, the most common culling method in the US entailed spraying turkeys with suffocating water-based foam; with this method, it takes seven to 15 minutes for the birds to die, and it causes significant pain. The second-most common method was gassing hens with carbon dioxide in small enclosures, which can render birds unconscious within 30 seconds. But according to the USDA, deploying these methods was sometimes too slow to meet the need of depopulating infected flocks within 24 hours. So, at the end of 2015, fearing another wave of outbreaks, the USDA approved ventilation shutdown — closing off air vents so the temperature rises, which can take hours for the birds to die by heat stroke. The USDA now says ventilation shutdown alone, without added heat or CO2, should only be used as a last-resort measure.Over email, Coker with the USDA told Vox that ventilation shutdown plus should only be used under “constrained circumstances,” like when depopulation by water-based foam or CO2 gassing is not possible. Various factors, like epidemiological information and housing and environmental conditions are weighed by USDA personnel, farm operators, and state officials when deciding whether or not to use VSD+. “Should VSD+ be authorized on-site, responders will carry it out quickly and as humanely as possible,” he said.Despite the policy to only use it under constrained circumstances, VSD+ has already been employed in at least six states and on millions of birds during this current outbreak. Will Lowrey, an attorney with the animal rights group Animal Outlook who has submitted public records requests on VSD+, found that in addition to being used on the 5.3 million Rembrandt hens, it has also been used on commercial poultry farms in Kentucky, Delaware, Minnesota (Jennie-O/Hormel), Missouri (Tyson Foods), and Wisconsin.Producers do have some incentive to use VSD+ over other culling options. To receive reimbursement for costs incurred during depopulation and disposal, they have to use a culling method permitted by the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA), a nongovernmental trade group, and VSD+ generally requires less labor and supplies than most other methods. But it’s an inhumane practice. In the AVMA’s culling guidelines for VSD+, the organization cites research conducted at North Carolina State University in 2016 meant to replicate and study ventilation shutdown. Researchers placed one chicken at a time in a small enclosure and pumped in heat, carbon dioxide, or both. Animal Outlook obtained footage from that experiment via a Freedom of Information Act request and shared it with Marina Bolotnikova for the Intercept. You can view the experiment below (warning: it’s graphic).In the video, a bird appears to be gasping for air, unable to stand, and according to a veterinarian interviewed by the Intercept, showing signs of attempting to vocalize (the video has no audio). It took around 91 minutes for the birds to die of just ventilation shutdown, 53 minutes when heat was added, 11.5 minutes when carbon dioxide was added, and nine minutes when both heat and carbon dioxide were added. Other research has found that times are much longer for hens in stacked cage systems, as opposed to turkeys and chickens raised for meat who live on barn floors.A coalition of more than 1,500 veterinarians, appropriately called Veterinarians Against Ventilation Shutdown, say the process is inhumane and are calling on the American Veterinary Medical Association to classify it as “not recommended” for culling. An investigator with Direct Action Everywhere — the group that’s been disrupting Minnesota Timberwolves games — says they entered a Rembrandt facility after depopulation and allegedly found some birds who had survived ventilation shutdown plus.“On the floor and in the cages we found … upwards of 100 chickens [still alive],” the investigator, who spoke with me on the condition of anonymity, said. “If you [extrapolate that for] the parts of the facility we didn’t go into, maybe several hundred chickens were still stuck in cages or running around loose.”Jones says more humane methods need to be prioritized, like nitrogen-filled foam and small-enclosure gassing, which knock animals unconscious before they die. Despite the challenges that come with these methods — increased costs and labor, among others — Watts, the ex-chicken farmer, says change would be a matter of the industry prioritizing animal welfare.“I hear the industry argument about everything costing too much,” he said. “If they’re serious about animal welfare, you and I [wouldn’t be] having this discussion on what could be done better — they would already be doing it.” He wants to see the industrialized model that dominates US agriculture today — the model he once raised birds in — replaced by farms with smaller flock sizes, and where birds are given outdoor access and more space. Factory-farming animals is an inherently risky business. And when a system that crams tens of thousands of birds together is faced with a highly-transmissible, lethal virus, that system is largely defenseless. At best, industry can work to minimize harm, but only if it’s willing to pay increased costs. But the conditions on today’s meat and egg farms — and the approval and adoption of ventilation shutdown — demonstrate a drive toward efficiency, not welfare. “In the short term, it would be my preference to see something more painless and quick” used to cull the birds, says Watts. “In the long term, what we’re looking at is a very flawed system — it’s time to just basically push it off a ledge and reboot and start over.”You’ve read 1 article in the last monthHere at Vox, we're unwavering in our commitment to covering the issues that matter most to you — threats to democracy, immigration, reproductive rights, the environment, and the rising polarization across this country.Our mission is to provide clear, accessible journalism that empowers you to stay informed and engaged in shaping our world.

The findings give insight into strategies to suppress the life-threatening lung inflammation triggered by viruses like influenza and SARS-CoV-2. The lung alveolus chip, shown here, was made by combining microfabrication techniques from the computer industry with modern tissue engineering techniques, human cells, and a vacuum pump.Felice Frankel, Wyss Institute, Harvard University The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the need for better experimental models of the lung. Such models are needed to understand disease processes, test existing drugs, and develop new therapies. Lung tissue is exposed to mechanical stress during breathing. These motions are known to affect lung development and function. However, most lung models lack the ability to control breathing movement to study its role in lung diseases. To address this challenge, a research team led by Dr. Donald Ingber from the Wyss Institute at Harvard University developed the lung alveolus chip, named for the alveoli—the tiny sacs deep in the lung that perform gas exchange. About the size of a memory stick, the chip can support the many cell types in human lung tissue. The cells that line the lung surface grow above a thin, porous membrane. Beneath the membrane grow lung blood vessel cells fed by a continuous flow of liquid. The entire chamber can be stretched and relaxed in cycles to mimic the effects of breathing. In past work, the team showed that a lung airway chip could be used to mimic viral infection in the human upper airway and quickly identify candidate antiviral drugs. In their new study, they used lung alveolus chips to study how breathing motions affect infection deep in the lung by influenza virus. They used the H3N2 strain, a leading cause of lung infections, hospitalizations, and deaths. The work was funded in part by NIH’s National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI). Results were published on April 8, 2022, in Nature Communications. H3N2 viruses added to the chip caused damage to lung tissue and cell death. In response, the tissue activated injury and repair pathways. Levels of cytokines, which help coordinate the protective immune response and inflammation, rose. Immune cells became better able to adhere to the lower cell level and migrate into the upper one. Notably, the types of cytokines seen differed from those during infection in static 2D cultures. The team next explored differences in gene activity with or without the physical stresses of breathing. Many genes involved in the protective immune response were more active in the tissue when subjected to the breathing-like motion. When infections in the lung alveolus chip with or without breathing movements were compared, those with motion had 50% less virus mRNA in the upper layer and 80% lower levels of active virus. When the movement was stopped, the protective immune response was suppressed. An analysis showed that activity of the gene for a protein called S100A7 was significantly higher when lung chips experienced breathing movements. S100A7, in turn, activated genes involved in the protective immune response, but increased levels of inflammatory cytokines as well. The team found that both layers of cells in the chip also had high levels of TRPV4, a protein known to be triggered by mechanical forces. When they added a TRPV4 inhibitor, S100A7 and inflammatory cytokines were suppressed. These experiments show that TRPV4 senses breathing movements and activates S100A7, which boosts the immune response. However, too great a response can cause inflammation. S100A7 is known to activate a receptor called RAGE. Like the TRPV4 inhibitor, a RAGE inhibitor called azeliragon suppressed cytokine production when given before or after infection with H3N2. Drugs that target these pathways might be able to suppress the excessive lung inflammation seen in some influenza or SARS-CoV-2 infections. “This research demonstrates the importance of breathing motions for human lung function, including immune responses to infection, and shows that our human alveolus chip can be used to model these responses in the deep portions of the lung, where infections are often more severe and lead to hospitalization and death,” says co-first author Dr. Haiqing Bai. Data from the study were included in an application to the FDA for a clinical trial to test azeliragon in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. —by Harrison Wein, Ph.D.Related LinksAirway-on-a-Chip Screens Drugs for Use Against COVID-193D-Printed Scaffold Engineered to Grow Complex TissuesNIH Awards $15 Million to Support Development of 3-D Human Tissue ModelsAbout Tissue ChipTissue Engineering and Regenerative MedicineReferences: Mechanical control of innate immune responses against viral infection revealed in a human lung alveolus chip.

Do you know when your family is most at risk for influenza? We spoke with an expert to learn when flu season typically starts and ends, so you can take precautions to keep everyone healthy. By Christin Perry Updated on May 4, 2022 Medically reviewed by David L. Hill, M.D., FAAP Close Getty Images As warm weather approaches, the last thing people want to think about is viruses. But when it comes to the influenza, there's good news: flu season is coming to an end! Flu season is a term that describes the months when influenza cases are the highest; like any virus, the number of infected people tends to ebb and flow in a relatively predictable pattern each year. Keep reading to learn when flu season starts and ends, and how to keep yourself and your family healthy this year. Flu Symptoms in Babies and When to Call the Doctor When Does Flu Season Start? Flu season typically begins in October, says Jay Woody, M.D., FACEP, ABEM, chief medical officer of Intuitive Health and a co-founder of Legacy ER & Urgent Care. "But cases tend to increase as the months get colder, and peak in January and February in the Northern Hemisphere." If you live in the Southern Hemisphere, you can expect to start seeing cases of the flu increase around April. When Does Flu Season End? Of course, you can get the flu any time of the year, since the virus is never fully eradicated; it simply lies dormant in warmer months. "While it is possible to get the flu out of season, it is not very common and would most likely be due to exposure from someone coming from an active flu area into an off-season area and spreading it," says Dr. Woody. In general, though, flu season typically ends in April or May, with very few cases found outside of the months of October through April. Flu season ends around September or October in the Southern Hemisphere. This Is The Best Time for Your Family to Get the Flu Shot When Should Kids Get the Flu Vaccine? At the start of flu season, it's impossible to determine how many cases will be diagnosed, and which influenza strains will circulate the most. "The flu virus changes yearly and vaccines are carefully formulated every year to provide protection against the most common current strains. In short, this means the vaccine you got last year isn't necessarily going to be effective this time around. This is why it's important to get a flu shot every year," say Dr. Woody. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends people get a flu shot as soon as the vaccine becomes available—ideally by the end of October. "The flu vaccine takes up to three weeks to reach maximum efficiency," says Dr. Woody, which means the earlier you get the current vaccine, the better. That said, the CDC notes "even if you are not able to get vaccinated until November or later, vaccination is still recommended because flu most commonly peaks in February and significant activity can continue into May." The Most Common Side Effects of the Flu Shot in Kids Are Mild—Here's What Parents Need to Know If your child needs two doses of the flu vaccine, they should get the first shot when it becomes available. The second dose is given at least 4 weeks afterwards, says the CDC. How to Protect Your Family from the Flu Once the flu starts circulating, you can reduce your family's chance of getting sick. Besides getting vaccinated, here are some of the most important steps you can take, according to Dr. Woody: Stay home when you're sick. This can prevent spreading the virus even more, and it also promotes your own return to health. Wash your hands regularly. "This is a small yet significant step in living healthier," says Dr. Woody. "Regularly washing your hands helps prevent bad bacteria and viruses from entering your body and causing you to get sick. Frequent hand-washing can help you avoid the flu and other diseases," including the coronavirus. Wear a mask in crowded indoor places. Any face mask that completely covers the mouth and the nose is effective because it prevents the aerosolization of contagious flu droplets, says Dr. Woody. In other words, face coverings can keep the virus particles from entering your nose and mouth, which can lead to infection. Eat a balanced diet. Your diet affects your overall health, so to keep your body in top condition, try to eat balanced meals that include plenty of fruits and vegetables, especially during flu season.

That’s leading to distressing scenes across rural America. In Iowa, millions of animals in vast barns are suffocated in high temperatures or with poisonous foam. In Wisconsin, lines of dump trucks have taken days to collect masses of bird carcasses and pile them in unused fields.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended influenza vaccination for all pregnant women since 2012. The vaccination coverage remains low worldwide, and in Europe, due to a lack of proposition from the health care providers, and a high refusal rate from the women. The primary aim of this study was to estimate the influenza vaccination coverage (IVC) in a population of pregnant women in France, and to analyse its evolution from 2009 to 2018. The secondary objective was to describe the vaccinated population and to find determinants associated with the vaccination. This retrospective cohort study is based on the EGB French health care database, a representative sample of the French population containing data from the health insurance system. All pregnant women who delivered medically or spontaneously over the 2009–2018 period were included. In the 2009–2018 period, only 1.2% pregnant women were vaccinated against influenza (n = 875/72,207; 95% CI 1.14–1.30). The IVC slightly increased after the 2012 WHO recommendation, from 0.33 to 1.79% (p < 0.001) but remained extremely low (4.1% in 2018). Women younger than 25 years old had a low coverage (0.6%) whereas women over 35 years old were more likely to get the influenza vaccine (1.7%; OR: 2.82, 95% CI 2.14–3.71). The vaccination behavior was not influenced by multifetal pregnancy or parity, but socio-economically deprived women were less likely to be vaccinated (OR: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.67–0.98). Women with pre-existing medical conditions had an overall higher vaccination rate (2.5%; OR: 2.32, 95% CI: 1.94–2.77). The vaccine was mainly prescribed by family physicians (58%). Influenza vaccination in pregnant women in France remains very low, particularly in younger, healthy women, and measures such as information campaigns towards pregnant women and studies of the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of the health care professionals need to be undertaken to improve the coverage.

The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates at a billon the number of influenza cases every year, 3 to 5 million severe cases and 290,000 to 650,000 deaths1.Pregnant women are more likely to develop a severe form of influenza2,3,4,5,6 associated with obstetrical complications such as prematurity and miscarriage7,8.Every year, a vaccine is developed with the latest epidemiological information on the circulating subtype in the southern hemisphere. The efficacy and innocuity of the vaccine during pregnancy have been well established in numerous studies9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20, as well as its protective effect for the infant through passive immunization21,22,23. Therefore, it should be prescribed to all pregnant women, to avoid severe forms of influenza and to protect their infant.In Europe the majority of countries have recommended vaccination for pregnant women, whatever the term of pregnancy24, since the WHO issued its recommendation in 201225. In France, the influenza vaccination has been recommended for pregnant women since 2009 (in the 2nd and 3rd trimester) and generalized in 2012 to all stages of pregnancy25,26. Prioritized during the influenza A(H1N1) outbreak, pregnant women were reluctant to get vaccinated, with an estimated pandemic influenza vaccination coverage (IVC) of 12.8%27.A report issued by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) in 2017 showed that the IVC in pregnant women in Europe remained low and uneven, from 0.3 to 56.1% in 2014–2015 and was not monitored by most of the member states, including France24. A few studies all based on classical surveys with different methodologies estimated the IVC in France to be between 5.4 and 26%27,28,29,30. In order to avoid the usual biases arising from classical surveys (selection bias and generalization of the findings), leading to a great variability in coverage estimates, and since the influenza vaccination is prescribed and fully reimbursed by the social security, we propose to use the French national healthcare insurance database to provide estimates of the IVC in pregnant women.In this study we sought to analyze the evolution of the annual IVC in pregnant women in France from 2009 to 2018, to evaluate the impact of the WHO 2012 recommendation25 on vaccination behavior, ad to identify determinants of influenza vaccination uptake in pregnancy.MethodsData source and designA repeated annual cross-sectional study was performed by using data from the “Echantillon Généraliste des Bénéficiaires” (EGB), a representative sample of the French population, from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2018. The EGB database contains the healthcare data of about 660,000 people, representing 1/97th of the French population. This sample of insured patients is randomized, anonymized and representative of the health care protected French population31,32. EGB contains sociodemographic information on the beneficiaries, as well as data on various health expenses reimbursed by the French healthcare insurance. That includes prescribed medications (identified according to their anatomical therapeutic chemical class, ATC), consultation with medical and para-medical professional, in private practice as well as public hospital, hospitalization and laboratory expenses. We can also find data on chronic diseases such as ALD (long-term disease) codes, diagnosis and medical history coded during hospitalization using ICD-10 (international classification of diseases, tenth revision) and medical procedures referenced according to the CCAM (common classification of medical acts).The EGB database is a validated tool for pharmacoepidemiological studies in France and has already proven to be a reliable tool to assess vaccination coverage for other reimbursed vaccines33,34,35,36.Study populationAll women who had data recorded on a delivery, vaginal birth, or caesarian section in the EGB database, during the period from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2018 were included. The exclusion criteria were unwanted pregnancy and denial of pregnancy. We did not exclude pregnancies that resulted in stillbirth, or therapeutic abortion after 22 weeks of gestation.The corresponding ICD 10 diagnosis codes and CCAM medical procedures are listed in Supplementary Tables 1–3.ExposureInfluenza vaccine exposure of the pregnant women included was identified through the reimbursement for a seasonal influenza vaccine in the EGB database, up to nine months before the date of their delivery, using two codes indicating dispensation (ATC J07BB and PRS_NAT 3331). We assumed that a vaccine purchased was injected afterwards and we calculated the IVC based on the number of pregnant women who had a reimbursed influenza vaccine.To evaluate the impact of the WHO 2012 recommendation25 on vaccination in the first trimester, we formed 3 subgroups of women according to their term of pregnancy during the vaccination campaign that takes place from October to January. Women who gave birth from November to February were labeled T3 as they were in their third trimester during the vaccination campaign. Likewise, those who gave birth from March to May were labelled T2, and those who gave birth from June to August were labeled T1.Collected dataThe collected data concerned were pre-existing medical condition, age, parity, CMUc (universal complementary healthcare insurance), and prescriber’s specialty.We used the French influenza vaccination recommendation to select women with pre-existing conditions who would have been targeted by the vaccination campaign outside of their pregnancy. Various conditions were included, and grouped in pulmonary, cardiac, neurological, renal, and hepatic disease, diabetes, and immunodeficiency (including HIV, stem cell and all organ transplantations, inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, hematological disease such as sickle cell disease and cancer).Data were extracted from the EGB database using the CCAM, ICD-10, or long-term chronic disease codes (Supplementary Tables 5–7).CMUc was used as a proxy for precarity since it is an insurance available only to patients with low income, to insure their access to healthcare free of charge. The women affiliated with the CMUc were considered socioeconomically deprived.Data analysisThe population was described by means and standard deviations for continuous data and by numbers and percentages for categorical data.Analysis of influenza vaccination of pregnant women was carried out using Chi squared test (or Fisher’s exact test when appropriate) for categorical data and using Student’s t-test for continuous data. Odds ratio (of vaccination) between groups are presented with their 95% confidence interval.To validate the reliability of our data and the computation method of IVC, we compared the IVC calculated through EGB in patients over 65 years old to French official influenza vaccination data (Santé Publique France, SPF).All tests were two-sided. A p-value < 5% was considered statistically significant, but the interpretations were based-on size of differences with clinical view (rather than just regarding the p-value), as significant tests do not always reflect clinically relevant differences when involving large samples. All analyses were performed using SAS Enterprise Guide (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC, USA).Ethics approvalThere was no requirement for ethical approval for this study. The EGB database guarantees the confidentiality and anonymity of all data (agreement by the French Data Protection Authority, CNIL, June 14, 2005).The use of the EGB database for medical research and for this study in particular has been approved and authorized by the French data protection authority (Commission Nationale de l’Informatique et des Libertés, CNIL). This use is conditioned by a specific training with certification that the researchers must follow. Chouki Chenaf has obtained this certification and was allowed to access and analyze the EGB database for this study. Furthermore, there was no requirement for ethical approval for this study. The EGB database guarantees the confidentiality of all data and anonymity (agreement of French data protection authority on June 14, 2005).ResultsValidation dataCompared to the nation-wide official influenza vaccination data (SPF) (Fig. 1), data from the EGB database showed a similar trend of influenza vaccination coverage in the French population over 65 years old.Figure 1Influenza vaccination coverage in the French population over 65 years old in EGB database and French Public Health data (SPF).Full size imageInfluenza vaccination coverage in pregnant womenFrom January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2018, 73,314 pregnant women were identified in the EGB database. Fifty-two denial of pregnancy and 1055 unwanted pregnancies were excluded from our cohort (Fig. 2). A total of 72,207 pregnant women were included in the study, whose characteristics appear in the Table 1.Figure 2Flow chart of the study.Full size imageTable 1 Influenza vaccination and associated factors among pregnant women from 2009 to 2018.Full size tableThe overall influenza vaccination coverage (IVC) was only of 1.21% in the 2009–2018 period (n = 875/72,207; 95% CI 1.14–1.30). The IVC slightly increased after the 2012 recommendation, from 0.33% in the 2009–2012 period, to 1.79% in the 2013–2018 period (p < 0.001) (Fig. 3).Figure 3Evolution of the influenza vaccination coverage from 2009 to 2018.Full size imageVaccinated women were older, less socially deprived, and had more pre-existing medical condition. There was no difference regarding the pregnancy outcome in the vaccinated and non-vaccinated population.The mean gestational age at delivery was 38.9 weeks in both vaccinated and non-vaccinated populations. The mean gestational age of vaccination was 22.9 weeks ± 9.7.The identified prescribers were mainly family physicians (58%), followed by gynecologists (21%) and midwives (4%). Some specialists sporadically prescribed the vaccine (total of 5%) and 12% were dispensed directly by the pharmacists. Women were most likely to be vaccinated if they were in their 2nd or 3rd trimester of pregnancy during the official vaccination campaign (Fig. 4), even after the 2012 recommendation was issued.Figure 4Evolution of influenza vaccination coverage by trimester of pregnancy during the vaccination campaign.Full size imageInfluenza vaccination determinantsThe vaccinated population was slightly older than the non-vaccinated one (respectively 32.0 and 30.3 years old, p < 0.001) and the vaccination rate increased proportionally with the age of the population (see Table 1). Women younger than 25 years old had a low coverage (0.6%) whereas women over 35 years old were more likely to get the influenza vaccine (1.7%; OR: 2.82, 95% CI 2.14–3.71). Socio-economically deprived women were less likely to be vaccinated (OR: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.67–0.98). Women with pre-existing medical conditions at risk for severe influenza had an overall higher vaccination rate (2.5%; OR: 2.32, 95% CI: 1.94–2.77). Of all the disease, renal disease and diabetes were associated with the highest vaccination rates (respectively 8.1% and 8.4%), and obesity with the lowest (1.5%).The vaccination behavior was not influenced by multifetal pregnancy (OR: 1.23, 95% CI 0.8–1.9) or by parity: primiparous and multiparous women had the same vaccination rate (1.2%).DiscussionMain resultsOur primary endpoint was to analyze the evolution of the IVC in pregnant women in France from 2009 to 2018 using the French national healthcare database. We showed that the IVC increased slightly since the 2012 recommendation but remained extremely low (only up to 4.1% in 2018), thus keeping pregnant women and their fetuses at risk of complications from influenza infections. In addition, the coverage for women who started their pregnancy during the vaccination campaign remained lower than those of women in their 2nd and 3rd trimester, thus questioning the impact of the recommendation, that encouraged the vaccination of women at all term of pregnancy. The IVC was higher for older women, and women with pre-existing condition at risk for severe influenza, and lower in socially deprived women as often described in other studies30,37,38,39.The vaccines were mainly prescribed by family physicians, even though gynecologists are usually the main healthcare providers during the pregnancy (68% according to Descamps et al.)30. It is most likely due to the fact that family physicians are traditionally in charge of immunizations.Comparison with data from the literatureIn Europe, the European Centre for Disease prevention and Control (ECDC) regularly compares the coverage rate in member states. In 2016–2017 the IVC was known for 9 member states, and ranged from 0.5% in Slovenia to 58.6% in the UK (median 25.0%)40. In other northern countries similar rates were found, 48.1% in the USA41, and 30.8% in New Zealand in 201839.Most data available in France are based on surveys and range from 7 to 26%.In 2014, Gaudelus et al. found an IVC in pregnant women of 7% through an online survey based on self-administered questionnaires28. In 2015, Loubet et al. found a IVC of 26% through an online survey, with a small non-representative sample and many selection bias29. Then Descamps et al. calculated an IVC of 7.4% based on the National Perinatal Survey, a large national study conducted in March 201630. This data was obtained through a declarative method where women were interviewed by a healthcare professional in the postpartum ward before discharge. Our study finds a IVC of 2.4% for women who gave birth in the same period of time (vs 7.4%) and part of this difference can be explained by a social desirability bias42 and recall bias that may over-estimate the IVC in any declarative vaccination evaluation. Hu et al. compared survey data and administrative data in children’s vaccination, to evaluate the impact of recall bias by their mother. The results showed the frequency of over-reporting of vaccination in the survey data, up to 6.6% for DPT vaccine, linked to social desirability bias43.Influenza vaccination determinantsThe determinants of low IVC in pregnant women have been well studied and two main obstacles to the vaccination are identified. The first obstacle is the lack of proposition from healthcare providers worldwide. In France, as in many other countries, only 25% of women are offered the vaccination28,44,45,46,47, when Canada or the United States offers it to 75% of women48,49. It is often linked to the vaccination status of the healthcare provider, that is also known to be very low50,51. The second obstacle is the refusal of the vaccine by pregnant women who either fear an impact of the vaccination on the pregnancy or underestimate the gravity of severe influenza. The refusal rate in France is 68%28,30.The education of healthcare professional is key to improve IVC in pregnant women45. Psarris et al. led a study in Greece in 2018 where the proposition rate rose from 27 to 100% and the IVC from 14 to 94% after a simple information campaign towards healthcare professionals44.Another determinant is the availability of the vaccine. Alessandrini et al. led a cross-sectional multicenter study in three maternities in Paris, where vaccination was available immediately during prenatal consultations, free of charge. The coverage increased from 0 to 35.4%52.The 2009 A (H1N1) pandemic also had a negative impact on influenza vaccination. A study led in 2010 and 2011 showed that the IVC decreased significantly the years after the A (H1N1) pandemic in France53. The overall pandemic vaccination coverage was low in general population (11.1%), about half the seasonal IVC (20%), and similar in patients at risk of severe influenza (12.2%)27. French authorities recommended pandemic A (H1N1) vaccination with a single dose of an adjuvanted-free vaccine (Panenza®) for all pregnant women after the first trimester. and the pandemic vaccination coverage was similar to the at-risk population (12.9%).The burden of A (H1N1) influenza was not as heavy as anticipated in France, with about 300 death and 1300 patients with serious forms of influenza54, much lower than expected. The disproportion between the impact of the epidemic and the mass vaccination campaign that was conducted, added to the many controversies and debate around the effectiveness of the vaccine led to a prolonged confidence crisis in seasonal influenza vaccination, and in a global mistrust of the French health authorities36.Although pregnant women are at increased risk for severe COVID-19, the same doubts and mistrust are found today in France regarding vaccination55.Strengths and limitations of the studyThe main strengths of the study are the size of the study population and the reproducibility of the calculation of the IVC through the EGB database. Our administrative method is reliable to assess a vaccination coverage in a limited time, on a large representative sample, with less bias than a declarative study. Our IVC results on patients over 65 years old are similar to the French official data, validating the use of the database to evaluate the IVC.Its limitations are those of the database, that can only record reimbursed vaccines, leaving out over the counter purchase and workplace vaccination. Influenza vaccination is recommended for patients over 65 years old, with chronic disease, obese patients, and pregnant women and their vaccine is supposed to be prescribed and fully reimbursed. In addition, anyone can buy it over the counter, for a reasonable price. We assumed that a pregnant woman would turn to her physician before making any health decision during her pregnancy and would have the prescription for the vaccine. However, women who purchased the vaccine over the counter on their own initiative or got the injection in their workplace would have been falsely classified as “unvaccinated” in our study.Even though our data cannot be fully exhaustive due to this easy access to the vaccine outside of the traditional health care pathway, our results are useful for analysis and comparison purposes.We identified some limitations in our secondary endpoints:Pre-existing medical condition were assessed through the existence of a long-term disease data claim, or hospital discharge quotation of an act or a pathology, as well a medication prescribed related to the pathology. We may have overlooked woman that had a condition that put them at risk of a severe influenza, but who requires no specific treatment and had no record of it in their files.Parity was estimated with the data available in EGB and is indicative. The data collected goes back to 2005, and any pregnancy occurring before that date will not have been taken into account, as well as any prior pregnancy that may have taken place abroad.We chose to define socioeconomic deprivation by the CMUc affiliation, a specific health insurance with full coverage for low-income patients. However, socioeconomic deprivation is a wider concept that includes criteria such as insecure employment, lack of familial support, and reduced access to culture, sport or vacation56. The EPICES score (Evaluation of precariousness and Inequalities in Health Examination Centers) is more reliable to describe socioeconomic deprivation57,58. Unfortunately, it requires data that are not available on the EGB database.Perspectives for research and healthcareA study evaluating the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of healthcare professionals regarding influenza vaccination in France could help to improve the IVC, taking into consideration the global reluctance towards vaccination in France. The IVC could be improved by targeted information campaigns towards all healthcare professionals involved with pregnancy care, and towards women in general.A national information campaign was issued on French television to promote influenza vaccination during the winter of 2020–2021, and pregnant women were listed as a priority. The impact of such campaigns could be monitored, by issuing IVC data yearly.Our evaluation of IVC in pregnant women with the EGB database may lead the way to other vaccination evaluations, such as pertussis vaccination coverage. A pertussis booster is often needed to properly protect the newborn from a severe infection, and an evaluation of the vaccination coverage could help improve this protection.Finally, from the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, pregnant women were considered at high-risk of severe forms of the disease, and they were included in specific clinical trial to demonstrate the mRNA vaccine safety and efficacy59. The vaccination, while limited at first to women with comorbidities, or with high-exposure professions, is now recommended for all pregnant women in their 2nd and 3rd trimester. The large-scale communication towards healthcare professionals on the necessity of COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy may have a positive impact on the IVC.ConclusionThe influenza vaccination coverage in pregnant women has slightly increased in France since the 2012 WHO recommendation, particularly during the 2nd and 3rd trimester of pregnancy, but remains extremely low (4.1% in 2018). Older women and women with a pre-existing condition at risk for severe influenza were more likely to be vaccinated whereas socio-economic deprived women had a lower coverage. Parity and multifetal pregnancy did not influence the vaccination behavior. The influenza vaccine was mainly prescribed by family physicians. The influenza vaccination needs to be generalized during pregnancy, and measures such as information campaigns and studies of the knowledge, attitudes and practices of both pregnant women and healthcare professionals need to be undertaken to improve the coverage.

Release: A person has tested positive for avian influenza A(H5) virus (H5 bird flu) in the U.S., as reported by Colorado and confirmed by CDC. This case occurred in a person who had direct exposure to poultry and was involved in the culling (depopulating) of poultry with presumptive H5N1 bird flu. The patient reported fatigue for a few days as their only symptom and has since recovered. The patient is being isolated and treated with the influenza antiviral drug oseltamivir. While it is possible the detection of H5 bird flu in this specimen is a result of surface contamination, that can’t be determined at this point and the positive test result meets the criteria for an H5 case. The appropriate public health response at this time is to assume this is an infection and take actions to contain and treat. This case does not change the human risk assessment for the general public, which CDC considers to be low. However, people who have job-related or recreational exposures to infected birds are at higher risk of infection should take appropriate precautions outlined in CDC guidance. CDC has been monitoring for illness among people exposed to H5N1 virus-infected birds since these outbreaks were detected in U.S. wild birds and poultry in late 2021 and into 2022. To date, H5N1 viruses have been found in U.S. commercial and backyard birds in 29 states and in wild birds in 34 states. CDC has tracked the health of more than 2,500 people with exposures to H5N1 virus-infected birds and this is the only case that has been found to date. Other people involved in the culling operation in Colorado have tested negative for H5 virus infection, but they are being retested out of an abundance of caution. This is the second human case associated with this specific group of H5 viruses that are currently predominant, and the first case in the United States. The first case internationally occurred in December 2021 in the United Kingdom in a person who did not have any symptoms and who raised birds that became infected with H5N1 virus. More than 880 human infections with earlier H5N1 viruses have been reported since 2003 worldwide, however, the predominant H5N1 viruses now circulating among birds globally are different from earlier H5N1 viruses. Infected birds shed H5N1 viruses in their saliva, mucous and feces. H5N1 virus infections among people are rare; however, human infections can happen when enough virus gets into a person’s eyes, nose, or mouth, or is inhaled. People with close or lengthy unprotected contact (not wearing respiratory or eye protection) with infected birds or places that sick birds or their mucous, saliva, or feces have touched, may be at greater risk of H5N1 virus infection. Illnesses in people from bird flu virus infections have ranged from mild (e.g., eye infection, upper respiratory symptoms) to severe illness (e.g., pneumonia) that can result in death. The only previous human case associated with this group of H5N1 viruses produced in no symptoms. Spread of earlier H5N1 viruses from one infected person to a close contact in the past have happened very rarely and have not led to sustained person-to-person spread. Local, state and federal health partners are working together to prevent spread of this H5N1 virus among birds and people. The U.S. Department of Interior and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) are the lead federal departments for avian influenza outbreak investigation and control in wild birds, and USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service is the lead agency for such activities in domestic birds such as poultry. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and CDC are the lead federal partners for public health for this situation. This one H5-positive human case does not change the human health risk assessment. CDC will continue to watch this situation closely for signs that the risk to human health has changed. Signals that could raise the public health risk might include multiple reports of H5N1 virus infections in people from exposure to birds, or identification of spread from one infected person to a close contact. CDC also is monitoring H5N1 viruses for genetic changes that have been associated with adaptation to mammals, which could indicate the virus is adapting to spread more readily from birds to people. CDC is taking routine preparedness and prevention measures, which includes an existing candidate vaccine virus that could be used to make vaccine for people if one were needed. CDC has guidance for clinicians, public health practitioners and people with potential bird exposures. As a reminder, people should avoid contact with poultry that appear ill or are dead and avoid contact with surfaces that appear to be contaminated with feces from wild or domestic birds, if possible. If you must handle wild birds or sick or dead poultry, minimize direct contact by wearing gloves and wash your hands with soap and water after touching birds. If available, wear respiratory protection such as a medical facemask and eye protection such as goggles. It is safe to eat properly handled and cooked poultry and poultry products in the U.S. The proper handling and cooking of poultry and eggs to an internal temperature of 165˚F kills bacteria and viruses, including H5N1 viruses. Additional information on protective actions around birds, including what to do if you find a dead bird, is available. CDC also has guidance for specific groups of people with exposure to poultry, including poultry workers and people responding to poultry outbreaks. CDC will continue to provide further updates to the situation and update guidance as needed.

Other people involved in the culling operation in Colorado have tested negative for H5 virus infection, but they are being retested out of an abundance of caution.”The only other known human case of the strain of bird flu currently predominant was in the UK in December last year, the CDC noted, although almost 900 cases have been reported worldwide from earlier H5N1 viruses since 2003.The US agriculture department has been tracking the spread of avian influenza across 30 states and affecting more than 35 million birds, according to its latest figures.The Guardian reported on Thursday that more than 22 million birds have been killed in an attempt to contain the outbreak, the majority in Iowa, the biggest US producer of eggs. That figure didn’t include a commercial egg farm in Knox, Nebraska, where 2.1 million poultry were reported affected on Wednesday.At one egg factory in Rembrandt, Iowa, about 250 employees were fired after roasting alive 5.3 million chickens, the largest cull at any factory farm in the country, in circumstances some fired workers and animal rights groups say were inhumane.The Storm Lake Times revealed that birds at Rembrandt were culled using a system known as ventilation shutdown plus (VSD+) in which air is closed off to the barns and heat pumped in until the temperature rises above 104F (40C).“They cooked those birds alive,” said one of the workers involved.Earlier in the week, an H3N8 strain of bird flu was detected in humans for the first time in Henan province in China.The four-year-old boy infected had been in contact with chickens and crows raised at his home, according to reports from China’s National Health Commission.Avian influenza, or bird flu, is a highly contagious viral disease. The first reports of human cases came in the 1990s.Some strains have been passed to humans but it is currently very rare and usually occurs only after very close contact with infected birds or animals.Explore more on these topicsColoradoBird fluHealthnewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveTax strategyFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInXNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Woman blowing nose with female doctor in background. The association between flu-like symptoms and the elevation of serum cytokine levels in patients treated with imiquimod cream is examined. In patients with actinic keratosis (AK) treated with imiquimod cream, localized reactions in the treated area may be the precursor of influenza-like side-effect symptoms, according to study findings published in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology International. For as long as topical imiquimod has been prescribed for actinic keratosis, external genital warts, and superficial basal cell carcinoma, some patients have complained of influenza-like symptoms. Researchers sought to examine the association between these side-effect symptoms and the elevation of serum cytokine levels, accounting for patient age, and amount of specific body area being treated. To accomplish this, they conducted a single-center, open-label, investigator-initiated trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT24435875) that included 22 patients (mean 62.8±8.99 years of age; 31.8% women) with 5 to 20 actinic keratosis (AK), stratified into 2 age groups and 2 treatment areas. In all, 12 patients were between 30 and 59 years of age and 10 patients were between 60 and 89 years of age. The area of treatment for 11 patients was the entire face or balding scalp whereas 11 patients were treated on their chest or upper extremities. All patients were treated with imiquimod 3.75% cream for 2 14-day cycles and all but 1 patient experienced partially resolved or total clearance of AK. There were 13 patients with localized skin reactions above the study average, of whom 7 also experienced influenza-like symptoms above the study average. Of these 7 patients, 5 were treated on the face or scalp and 2 on the trunk/arm; 4 of these 7 patients were in the younger age group and none of the 7 were among the patients in the older group treated on the trunk/arm. Among all patients with localized skin reactions preceding systemic influenza symptoms, side-effects developed within 7 to 11 days of being treated. Researchers reported that “Levels of circulating cytokines had no predictive value.” Study limitations included the small sample size and small number of cytokines investigated. Researchers concluded that “The onset of local skin reactions may serve as a predictor for the potential onset of systemic symptoms that mimic those of influenza and could be used as a talking point for patients, though further research is needed.” Disclosure: A study author declared affiliations with biotech, pharmaceutical, and/or device companies.

(AP) — Bird flu is killing an alarming number of bald eagles and other wild birds, with many sick birds arriving at rehabilitation centers unsteady on their talons and unable to fly.“It’s quite a sight to see an eagle with a six-foot wingspan having uncontrollable seizures because of highly pathogenic avian influenza,” said Victoria Hall, executive director of the University of Minnesota’s Raptor Center. “At that point, they’re so far into the disease there’s no treatment options left.”The latest outbreak of the highly contagious virus has led to the culling of about 37 million chickens and turkeys in U.S. farms since February, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture has confirmed 956 cases of bird flu in wild birds, including at least 54 bald eagles. But the actual number is likely significantly higher because not every wild bird that dies is tested and the federal tally doesn’t include cases recorded by wildlife rehabilitation centers.The latest reported toll is nearly 10 times higher than the 99 confirmed cases in wild birds during the last bird flu outbreak in 2015. This time, the virus has been detected in birds in 34 states, indicating it is far more widespread than seven years ago.The U.S. Geological Survey’s National Wildlife Health Center also collects data from wildlife officials on suspected and confirmed bird flu deaths. It lists 8,536 recent wild bird deaths from avian influenza.“This is definitely an unprecedented event,” said researcher Rebecca Poulson, who has been studying avian influenza for 15 years at the University of Georgia’s Southeastern Cooperative Wildlife Disease Study. “The number of birds and species and states already in which it has been detected is pretty alarming.”Water fowl including ducks and geese, which typically carry the virus, and the raptors and scavengers that feed on them are the most commonly sickened birds, but cases have been confirmed in more than three dozen species. Ducks and geese are usually able to live with the virus without getting sick, but the latest variant is proving more contagious and more deadly.“We are seeing a tremendous impact from this virus,” said Hall, whose Raptor Center in St. Paul, Minnesota, treats roughly 1,000 birds a year. “We are seeing birds coming in suffering from this virus every single day.”Nearly 61% of the 188 birds the rehabilitation center has tested since late March have had bird flu and all but one of those died. Hall said the center had to set up an area where workers wearing protective gear test sick and injured birds for avian influenza and quarantine them before bringing them into the center, to avoid infecting other birds.None of the 114 positive cases the center has recorded, including 28 bald eagles, are included in the USDA count, Hall said. She said a great horned owl recovered from the virus, giving her hope that some wild birds may be able to fight it off.USDA officials haven’t responded to questions about why they are excluding the data from rehabilitation centers.Scientists estimated in a study published three years ago that the number of wild birds in North America had fallen by nearly 3 billion since 1970 as humans continue to encroach on their habitat. But it’s too soon to know what impact the bird flu will have on bird populations because the outbreak is ongoing and there hasn’t been enough time to study it, according to U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service veterinarian Samantha Gibbs, and other experts.“We’re quite concerned. I think that we’re going to be watching very carefully what the mortality rates are throughout the spring and summer,” Gibbs said.Gibbs and Poulson said they fear the virus could survive the summer, when it usually dies off, leading to fall infections when migratory birds return south. That happened in Europe, where the virus is circulating first.Bald eagles — the U.S. national symbol since the 1700s — are among America’s most celebrated conservation success stories. With an estimated 300,000 bald eagles in the country today — a population that quadrupled between 2009 and 2021 — the bird was removed from the U.S. Endangered Species List in 2007. Given that, experts believe the species should weather the impact of this virus.State and federal officials will track the success of nesting eagles this spring and summer to gauge the impact of the virus.In Georgia, where three bald eagles that died tested positive for bird flu, the state Department of Natural Resources has documented a sharp drop in bald eagle reproduction this year in six coastal counties where many migratory birds spend the winter. Fewer than half of the 73 nests found there produced offspring, while nests elsewhere in the state had a success rate close to the average of 78% recorded in recent years.Some experts, including Hall, suggest that residential bird feeders should be removed to avoid further spread of the virus, but the USDA and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service haven’t recommended that because bird flu isn’t common among the songbirds that frequent backyards. Still, they say it’s important to regularly clean bird feeders to help limit the spread of other diseases.“Wild birds could use all the help they can get right now,” Hall said.When the virus is found on poultry farms, officials slaughter entire flocks to curb the spread, even when most birds have no symptoms. So far, 37.36 million birds have been killed in 32 states.USDA officials stress that bird flu doesn’t jeopardize food safety because infected birds aren’t allowed to enter the food supply, and properly cooking poultry and eggs to 165 degrees Fahrenheit will kill any viruses or bacteria.Health officials also say bird flu doesn’t represent a significant health risk to people, even though one human case of the disease was confirmed in Colorado last month. Officials say people are unlikely to catch the virus unless they have prolonged direct exposure to infected birds.___Associated Press writers Carrie Antlfinger in Milwaukee and Doug Glass in Minneapolis contributed to this story.Copyright 2022 The Associated Press.

(David Mdzinarishvili/Reuters)Social SharingA highly transmissible and deadly variant of avian influenza has turned up in a small flock of chickens in southeastern New Brunswick.The Canadian Food Inspection Agency's website shows the highly pathogenic avian influenza — or H5N1 — was detected last Monday in the Turtle Creek area, about 20 kilometres south of Moncton.The agency describes the premises where the disease was found as "small flock," meaning the chickens are kept on "private property that is not designated as a commercial flock."An online map shows the "infected zone" where the disease was detected, along with a "primary control zone" encircling it.According to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, no birds, bird products or byproducts can be moved into, out of, within or a primary control zone without permission.Movement of live birds into the infected zone is prohibited until the disease is determined to be under control within the primary control zone. At that time, movements can be considered under the restrictions of a specific permit.An interactive map by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency shows the infected area and the primary control zone, which is subject to special rules for poultry producers. (Canadian Food Inspection Agency)In an email to CBC News, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency said the outbreak affected fewer than 100 chickens.The agency said any chickens that didn't die from avian influenza were humanely destroyed and disposed of to prevent the spread of disease.The detection of H5N1 in Turtle Creek is the first to hit farmed poultry in New Brunswick since the disease began sweeping across Canada in recent months.The disease, however, has been detected in wild birds in New Brunswick, which the agency says it suspects caused the Turtle Creek outbreak."Scientific evidence indicates that the virus circulates naturally in wild birds, and is spread through migratory birds. Highly pathogenic AI is worldwide and outbreaks are currently occurring in the United States and other countries in Asia and Europe."In March, the Canadian Wildlife Service announced a case was confirmed in a greater black-backed gull in Riverview, which is about 20 kilometres from where it's been more recently detected.The disease has since turned up in other wild bird species in New Brunswick, including Canada goose, mallard and American crow.The spread among wild birds has led experts to advise people to either take down or frequently clean backyard bird feeders.Watch: Avian influenza cases on the rise in CanadaAvian flu cases on the rise in Canada3 years agoDuration 2:02A highly contagious strain of the avian flu is spreading among birds across the country. Experts insist the risk to humans is low, despite one confirmed case of human transmission in Colorado.B.C. farmer 'devastated' after avian flu confirmed in chicken flockMost forms of avian flu are mild but the H5N1 strain can cause serious disease and death in wild and domestic birds.The disease is not considered a significant concern for humans but infections can wipe out a flock in a matter of days.With no treatment, an entire flock must be destroyed to ensure the infection is contained.N.B. outbreak not huge concern, says industry repLisa Bishop-Spencer, spokesperson for Chicken Farmers of Canada, said the Turtle Creek outbreak is not a huge concern to her given it's not at a commercial operation.However, the speed at which the disease has spread shows the need for poultry and egg producers to take precautions with their operations, she said.Lisa Bishop-Spencer, spokesperson for Chicken Farmers of Canada, said the concern is that the avian influenza spreads to large commercial poultry operations. (Zoom/CBC)"So we need to take precautions to make sure that it not only doesn't spread to commercial flocks, but that it doesn't spread at all, so the important thing for us right now is to help set up those [primary control] zones," she said.Bishop-Spencer said a primary control zone covers about a 10-kilometre radius, which subjects any poultry producers to heightened rules."So if there was a poultry operation in that area, the farmer would have to take extra bio-security measures; doing things like hosing down and washing the tires and the wheel wells of any truck that comes onto his property."As for the general public, Bishop-Spencer said commercial poultry products remain safe to consume."At this point, I think it's just important that, you know, everybody's aware and alert, but I don't think anybody needs to be alarmed."CBC's Journalistic Standards and Practices|About CBC NewsCorrections and clarifications|Submit a news tip|Report errorRelated Stories Hand-feeding of chickadees banned near Saskatoon as avian flu spreads Poultry producers on edge as avian flu sweeps through Alberta farmsFooter LinksMy AccountProfileCBC GemNewslettersAbout CBC AccountsConnect with CBCFacebookXYouTubeInstagramMobileRSSPodcastsContact CBCSubmit FeedbackHelp CentreAudience Relations, CBC P.O.

(ABC News: Mark Leonardi)abc.net.auews/influenza-and-covid-vaccination-timing-getting-both-viruses/101036772Link copiedShareShare articleFlu season has officially arrived, with Australia already seeing thousands of cases of the virus.Both COVID-19 and influenza are now circulating in the community, and health authorities are pleading with people to get their flu shot to reduce the "life-threatening" risk of having both at the same time.Here is what you need to know about reducing your risk of catching influenza or the flu/COVID combo — dubbed "flurona" — this winter.When can you get the flu vaccine after recovering from COVID-19?Ian Mackay, a virologist at the University of Queensland, says you can get the vaccine if you've recovered from the virus, but it's best to wait if you've still got severe symptoms so as to not "fire up an already fired-up immune system"."So the usual thing with vaccination is if you've got any signs or symptoms or you're ill — you've got a fever or anything like that — don't get the vaccine at that particular time," he said.Maria Boulton says if you have no symptoms of COVID-19, you are safe to get the flu shot. (ABC News: Chris Gillette)If you're feeling fine, however, you're good to go straight away."Once you're better, and once you're out of isolation, you can go and have your flu vaccine safely," Maria Boulton from AMA Queensland says.Can you get both the flu and COVID-19 shots on the same day?Yes, under ATAGI guidelines, people are now able to get a COVID-19 vaccine and flu vaccine at the same time, even though the previous advice was to wait."[The prior advice] was just making sure that it was safe," Dr Mackay said."And that really requires seeing what happens with different groups around the world who are doing two vaccinations at once, and one followed by another, or in the opposite order."It's really just making sure there is enough data for the Australian authorities to give the best advice.Some GPs have noticed more people getting the booster and flu shots at the same time. (ABC News: Mark Leonardi)"I really strongly recommend you do get your flu shot and your booster at the same time. And you'll be as safe as you can possibly be."Dr Boulton says her clinic has experienced an uptick in the number of people receiving both vaccines together."There's no need to delay and we're getting a lot of patients who are taking us up on both at the same time, and it's really great because then they don't have to come back again," she said.Does the flu shot actually work though?Dr Mackay says the most common reason people are hesitant about getting the flu shot is because they believe it doesn't protect them well from the flu."We tend to think of the flu vaccine as being a bit rubbish, and that's not really true," he said."If it's a good match it's a really good vaccine.He says its effectiveness really depends on how the virus has changed or evolved by the time the flu season arrives."That means the vaccines have to change. It's not about a rubbish vaccine. It's about how much that virus has outsmarted us. And because we have to predict ahead of time to make our flu vaccines, we are hoping that what arrives in winter is what we planned for."We're not always brilliantly protected from the flu. That's not the fault of the vaccine. It's the fault of the fact that this is a slippery virus."The flu vaccine is constantly being changed as the virus evolves.Dr Boulton says there has definitely been fewer people getting vaccinated against the flu so far this year, compared to last."I think people are slightly fatigued about vaccines, but it is important to know that that the flu can be a serious condition, especially for young young babies, older people, people with chronic illnesses and pregnant women," she said."Our borders are open. There's not as many restrictions as there were before. And so we expect that the flu virus will circulate once again. And we know that for some people they can have quite a severe disease so the best thing we can do is vaccinate."What can we expect from this flu season?It's been a long time since we've had a "flu season" and Dr Mackay says it's important to remember there are four main types of flu and they all circulate at the same time — another reason why making a foolproof vaccine is difficult.What is 'flurona'?Photo shows A man in full PPE with Hebrew writing across the top of his face guardIsraeli health authorities have detected a case of what some are calling "flurona" — a double dose of COVID-19 and the flu. It comes as the country is experiencing a spike in influenza cases in recent weeks, sparking fears of a "twindemic"."It's going to be a bit different this year, I think, than it has been for the last two years, but generally there's two different flu B's and two different flu As and they all co-circulate," he said."They're all flu viruses and they're all more different from each other than any of the variants of SARS‐CoV‐2 . So there's a whole lot of variety in there that we just don't really talk about."He says influenza A seems to be the dominant strain at the moment.Queensland Chief Health Officer John Gerrard says the transmission of influenza has been significantly impacted by measures designed to slow the spread of coronavirus over the past two years.The result, he says, is we have not been been as exposed to the virus over the past two years as we normally would be."As our pandemic measures have relaxed, we are seeing increasing numbers of influenza and we are likely to see a significant wave of influenza on top of COVID-19 this winter," he said.What about 'flurona'?On Wednesday, Queensland Health Minister Yvette D'Ath warned some people would get both COVID-19 and influenza at the same timeShe there was a "great risk" of it being "life threatening"."We want to reduce these risks," she said."It's in your hands, it's easy: Get in and get your jab today."Queensland Health Minister Yvette D'Ath gets her flu shot. (Twitter: Annastacia Palaszczuk)Dr Mackay says we can expect a "mixed bag" of outcomes for people who get infected with both the flu and coronavirus."We've seen studies that say they're worse outcomes when you have more than one infection at a time, sometimes even better outcomes, and sometimes no different than if you have either one by itself," he said."So it's not really clear, based on the history of respiratory virus, how that will play out, and we just don't know enough yet about flu and corona together."Dr Boulton says there have been reports of people infected with both viruses experiencing more severe symptoms.Where can I get the flu shot?The influenza vaccine is now widely available at GPs and pharmacies, and Dr Boulton says now is a good time to get it."If you go and get it now, you'll be protected for that winter peak, so there's no need to delay," she said.Flu 'worse than COVID' in childrenPhoto shows Woman in bed with a cold blowing her nose.Health authorities gear up for the first real flu season in three years, with experts particularly worried about the impact on young children."Also, there are some requirements. For example … if you have a relative in some of the aged care facilities, you will need to provide evidence that you've had a flu vaccine so that the residents are protected."The National Immunisation Program Schedule helps eligible people access the influenza vaccine for free.

Courtesy NIAID-RML Hours after a federal judge struck down the federal mask mandate covering air travel and other public transportation last month, Delta Airlines celebrated the move in a statement saying that Covid-19 “has transitioned to an ordinary seasonal virus.” By the next day, after an intense backlash from public health experts, Delta had taken the offending language down. “‘Ordinary viruses don’t cause 1 million deaths in one country in just 2 years,” tweeted epidemiologist Jessica Malaty Rivera, a senior adviser at the Rockefeller Foundation’s Pandemic Prevention Institute.advertisement SARS-CoV-2 remains a long way from being ordinary. It has not yet found seasonal cadence — take the recent surge in Europe and the U.K., which comes just weeks after the initial Omicron wave subsided — and it’s still capable of inflicting mass death and disability (see Hong Kong’s lethal last few months). But there are signs that the virus — and our relationship to it — is shifting in subtle ways that make it more like seasonal flu than it was at the start of the pandemic. When everyone’s a superspreader, no one is One of the most intriguing shifts involves how Covid now spreads from person to person.advertisement Early on, a hallmark of SARS-CoV-2 transmission was that the majority of infections hit a dead end. A 2020 study from Hong Kong found that 80% of new infections were caused by just 10% to 20% of cases, often in indoor superspreading events. That meant most people didn’t spread the virus to anyone else. Scientists call this phenomenon of patchy transmission “overdispersion.” Dispersion is a measure of how uniformly a pathogen spreads — does it steadily chug along or break out randomly in big bursts? And though its importance has long been overlooked, understanding dispersion is critical for developing effective infection prevention strategies. Related: Covid hasn’t given up all its secrets. Here are 6 mysteries experts hope to unravel “It’s a reason why some infections are more controllable than others, even for the same reproductive number,” said Benjamin Cowling, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Hong Kong who led the 2020 study on overdispersion. It’s a lesson some countries learned right away. When Hitoshi Oshitani, a virologist and infectious disease specialist at Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, saw data from Japan’s retrospective contact tracing teams, he realized that most transmission was being caused by a few infectious people gathering in poorly ventilated indoor spaces like gyms and restaurants. If they could cut the occurrence of those potential superspreading events, they had a chance at containing the virus. Oshitani, who advises the Japanese government, suggested a simple mantra that became key to the country’s Covid-19 success: avoid closed spaces, crowded places, and close-contact settings — later known as the Three C’s. But as more infectious variants have emerged, Oshitani’s team has observed changing transmission patterns in Japan. Rural areas that avoided SARS-CoV-2 surges in earlier waves have been inundated with Omicron, he told STAT via email. Clusters are also showing up more in schools and nursing homes. And some data indicate that secondary attack rates in households are higher for Omicron — meaning if someone brings the virus home, more people they share a roof with are likely to contract it. Studies in Norway and in the U.S. have also shown that Omicron spreads much more easily in households, suggesting that superspreading events may be becoming less important as primary drivers of contagion chains. It’s not that superspreaders have become less super in their spreading; it’s that with Omicron, everyone else may be catching up with them. “Epidemiologically the Omicron variant is quite different from previous strains,” Oshitani wrote. “The level of overdispersion is also probably different. But we need more data to adjust our public health responses.” Cowling is also trying to understand how Omicron and other variants are changing the degree to which the virus spreads through clusters. But it’s become much harder to study as contact tracing programs in Hong Kong have buckled under the deluge of new cases. “They had trouble keeping up with 100 cases a day in late 2020,” Cowling said. At the peak of Hong Kong’s fifth wave, earlier this year, between 50,000 and 100,000 new cases were being reported daily. “The system basically broke down,” he said. “So I’m not sure what exactly we’re going to be able to show beyond what was happening in the very early stages of that wave.” To Seema Lakdawala, a microbiologist at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, these steeper, shorter waves of infection caused by Delta, Omicron, and now BA.2 look like signs of a potentially important shift in the virus’s behavior. “It could be that more individuals are now forward-transmitting and we’re seeing a move away from cluster transmission to one that is more linear like you would expect for flu,” she said. The original strain of SARS-CoV-2 was estimated to have a dispersion parameter, k, of around 0.1, meaning that fewer than 20% of people infected passed on the virus to someone else. Pandemic influenza is less sparing. With a k of around 1, it reliably hops hosts more than 60% of the time, based on estimates from the 1918 pandemic. A recent modeling study led by Lidia Morawska at Queensland University of Technology found that the Delta variant is less reliant on superspreading events, with a k of 0.49. Her team hasn’t yet repeated the work for Omicron, but she expects that its preference for the upper respiratory tract, where it replicates at astonishing rates, probably results not just in more transmission, but more uniformity in who transmits to others. “Even a very short time is sufficient to inhale enough of this virus to be infected,” Morawska said. “Short enough that ventilation may not have had a chance to remove the virus from the air.” That’s why she and others are now pushing for the use of germicidal ultraviolet light, which can zap infectious viral particles in the air, killing them in an instant. This technology could have prevented the Gridiron superspreader event last month in Washington, University of Maryland aerobiologist Don Milton argued in a recent New York Times op-ed. Disinfecting UV light “should become the norm for large indoor gatherings where meals are served and masks cannot be worn,” he wrote. Less susceptible targets But the virus is just one component of what makes for a superspreading event. The other is the host network where it lands — which is a function of the current levels of population immunity and how many contacts people are making. “Based on everything we’ve seen throughout the pandemic, the underlying population susceptibility seems to be the primary driver of spread,” said Emily Gurley, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University. “I think that’s more important than changes in the virus itself.” That means that even as SARS-CoV-2 has evolved to be more contagious, it is encountering a small and ever-shrinking proportion of the population whose bodies have never seen some version of it before. Most people, through prior infection, vaccination, or a combination of the two now have immune systems capable of fending off the deadliest outcomes of contracting SARS-CoV-2. And that’s starting to look a lot like what happened when pandemic flu transitioned to seasonal flu. Related: Experts fear U.S. may default to annual Covid boosters without sufficient data We’re not at an immunological détente yet. Over the last decade, seasonal flu killed about 30,000 people each year, on average. Covid-19 killed 148,000 people in the first four months of 2022 alone. Last year it was the third leading cause of death in the U.S., after heart disease and cancer. But we’re not impossibly far away. And the availability of effective early treatments like Paxlovid in addition to vaccines will also continue to tilt the scales away from an encounter with SARS-CoV-2 turning into a lethal or disabling one, for most people. (Although millions of immunocompromised Americans remain at risk of those worst outcomes.) “A lot of it comes down to immunological diversity,” said William Hanage, an epidemiologist at Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health. “Gatherings are less likely to be as significant a component of spread at this point, but superspreading events will continue to be possible,” he said. “That’s what we’re seeing in D.C. at the moment. People who have avoided Covid thus far are making contacts they weren’t making six months ago, and so the virus is just making hay with all those contacts.” It drives home another thing about dispersion — it can change based on people’s behavior too. In a study that is currently under review, Cowling’s team found that as Hong Kong got more strict about limiting large gatherings and requiring masks in public places during initial waves of the virus, its overdispersion actually went up, completely contradicting what they expected. “We thought if we stop the superspreader events then the secondary case numbers will be ones or twos not tens or twenties,” said Cowling. “And that happened some. But what also happened is there were a lot more people who didn’t transmit to anyone. We think of overdispersion as just the big numbers, but it’s also the zeroes.” And the zeroes are a lot harder to keep track of. So it’s possible that superspreading events have been overestimated for Covid-19 because they’re big dramatic events—like the Skagit Valley Chorale or the Gridiron gala. It’s also possible that flu might actually be more like Covid-19 than we appreciate. “I suspect that there’s actually a lot of superspreading with flu, we just haven’t studied it in the same way that we have for this coronavirus,” said Cowling. ‘Flu-like’ genetic drift Flu and SARS-CoV-2 are starting to resemble each other at a more basic level too — how they evolve. During the first year and a half of the pandemic, new variants of concern arose from distantly related branches of the SARS-CoV-2 family tree. Delta didn’t arise from Beta, which didn’t arise from Alpha. The constellation of mutations each new strain acquired that gave it a competitive advantage evolved independently. Omicron was an even more extreme example of this. The variant popped onto the scene in South Africa at the end of 2021 looking like a version of the virus that hadn’t been seen in someone since mid-2020, leading experts to speculate it went underground either in an immunocompromised person’s body or into a different species entirely. But since Omicron has spread around the world, the new variants that have emerged and outpaced it — BA.2, BA.1, BA.4, and others — have all splintered off from the same starting point. This sort of ladder-like accumulation of mutations is something much more characteristic of how influenza evolves. In general, there’s one major lineage that “drifts” year to year, inching toward more immune escape and higher transmissibility, rather than leaping out of nowhere. This could be good news, because more stable, predictable evolution would make it easier to develop meaningful Covid-19 vaccines and boosters, better tuned to handle whichever version of the virus will be circulating six to 12 months from now, as Trevor Bedford, a computational biologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center pointed out in a recent Twitter thread. But, as he noted, it’s hard to say how long this “flu-like drift” will last before another huge evolutionary jump, like Omicron, might take place. “Nobody knows what this virus is going to do next,” said Hanage. That’s why he thinks the viral videos of flight attendants collecting masks sends the wrong message. “This is not a thing that ends in a way that people understand. The pandemic will be done but not in the way that most people think of as done.” About the Author Reprints Megan Molteni Science Writer Megan Molteni reports on discoveries from the frontiers of genomic medicine, neuroscience, and reproductive tech.

Photo Getty Images By Rick Sobey | rick.sobey@bostonherald.com | Boston HeraldUPDATED: May 6, 2022 at 4:27 PM ESTIt’s not only COVID-19 that’s making people feel under the weather these days.Many residents across the Bay State are feeling pretty sick this spring, as the four-headed monster of COVID, the flu, common colds and allergies are all rising at the same time — and causing plenty of stress as people wonder if they have COVID.There has been a recent “dramatic” uptick in non-COVID respiratory virus tests among patients and outpatients at Tufts Medical Center.“Respiratory viruses are up for sure,” added Shira Doron, infectious disease physician and hospital epidemiologist at Tufts Medical Center.“We’re seeing quite a bit of non-COVID coronaviruses,” Doron said of common cold viruses that are circulating the region as more people take off their masks, and leave themselves susceptible to getting sick after more than two years of the pandemic.Those viruses include human metapneumovirus — which causes an upper respiratory infection. Local doctors have also been seeing patients being sick with human rhinovirus/enterovirus.Meanwhile, flu severity for Massachusetts has been moderate. The percent of hospitalizations associated with influenza is 1.22%, which is higher than last season and the 2019-2020 season, but similar to the 2018-2019 season. More influenza A than influenza B positive specimens have been reported.Then there’s people suffering from spring allergies, as pollen triggers symptoms for a lot of people. “There are clues to distinguish between the four (COVID, flu, common cold and allergies), but without a positive test, you can never be sure,” Doron said.One distinguishing symptom for allergies is itchiness — itchy eyes, itchy throat, itchy nose.“You’re more likely to be sneezing from allergies than from COVID,” Doron said.Those who have the flu typically do not have nose symptoms — the nasal congestion and sinus pressure that someone might get from a common cold.“When you get the flu, it typically comes on like you’re hit by a truck all of a sudden,” Doron said, noting the intense fatigue, body aches and fever. “It can be difficult to distinguish from COVID.”A COVID symptom has been the loss of smell and taste, but those symptoms have gone away a bit ever since the omicron variant and subvariants arrived.People who have a common cold will usually have nasal symptoms and could have a sore throat, which has been a prominent feature of omicron.Anyone with respiratory symptoms should get tested for COVID, Doron said. At-home tests can take days to turn positive, she cautioned.Doron added that people who are experiencing respiratory viral symptoms and test negative for COVID should continue to mask up to avoid spreading their non-COVID illness to others.

Avian influenza is especially hard on raptors – hawks, falcons, eagles, osprey, kites, vultures, buzzards and owls, and it’s commonly spread by waterfowl according to Dr. Karra Pierce, director of veterinary services at the Wildlife Center of Virginia.“They’re the biggest kind of reservoir host for this virus," she explains. "It actually doesn’t cause any signs in a lot of them, so a lot of them can be completely healthy yet spreading it around.”Not so for birds of prey.“It can cause respiratory signs. gastrointestinal signs, neurological signs, weakness, and it is almost 100% fatal." Pierce says.The center has not yet seen patients with bird flu, but it’s worried about a unique group of employees – nearly a dozen raptors with lifelong injuries that keep them from hunting. They accompany staffers from the wildlife center on educational missions – to schools and public events.“We have Buddy the Bald Eagle, three red tailed hawks – Rowan, Rosalie and Ruby. We have Hudson, a gyre falcon, we have Maggie a peregrine falcon. We have Verlin, an American kestrel and then we have Gus and Athena which are barred owls.”Pierce worries they could be infected, so the center is taking special precautions.“That means having quarantine periods, foot baths, gowns and booties. The people caring for the education ambassadors are people separate from those caring for wild patients in the hospital. We all change our shoes when we get here, and with the ambassadors their food is now being prepared in a separate place from where the wild bird food is being prepared – just to be extra, extra careful.”The state’s poultry industry is also on guard, but so far there are no reports of bird flu in large agricultural operations and just one case reported in a backyard flock in mid-February. Four ducks shot by hunters have also tested positive for the virus, but Virginia has seen no cases of wild bird infection this spring. Veterinarian Pierce is hopeful the plague may have passed us by.“The one thing about avian influenza virus is it does tend to be more of a problem when temperatures are colder, so as the summer heats up hopefully it will be less of a problem for us.”In the meantime, she says, the public should watch for problems in their parks and yards.“Certainly if you are finding multiple dead birds you are going to want to contact the Department of Wildlife Resources so they can investigate. The biggest risk we have is waterfowl, so if you have a wetland or something in your backyard, you’re going to want to monitor it pretty closely, but any unusual mass die-off of birds – more than five birds is what DWR is requesting right now – should be reported to their help line.”Song birds are not especially vulnerable to avian influenza, and there is no consensus on what backyard birdwatchers should do.“Some people are still saying you can keep your bird feeders out. Other people are taking them down. There are lots of different schools of thought. I would say this time of year there is plenty of food out there for birds, so if you do decide to take your bird feeder down, they should be fine. They are a low risk species but it’s not impossible for them to contract it. We’ve seen positive cases in blue jays already this year.”And the wildlife center cautions that while bird flu may not be evident over the summer, It is closely tied to bird migration, so we could see a resurgence in the fall.This report, provided by Virginia Public Radio, was made possible with support from the Virginia Education Association.

From Monday hens are allowed back outside, after the government lifted restrictions imposed last November requiring them to stay indoors. It means free-range labelling can return to shelves.Since March, the eggs have been classified as "barn eggs" in supermarkets due to the length of time birds had been kept inside.Free-range eggs no longer available in UKEgg shortage warning as chicken feed price doublesBirds culled amid multiple outbreaks of avian fluFree-range eggs come from hens that have unlimited outdoors access during the daytime. The RSPCA says about 55% of all eggs produced in the UK are free-range.Image caption, The production of free-range eggs can resume after a mandatory housing order was liftedThe UK has been facing its largest ever outbreak of avian influenza.While poultry and other captive birds will no longer need to be housed, unless they are in a protection zone, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said other precautions to protect flocks remain in force. They include enhanced cleansing and biosecurity measures. In a joint statement, the four chief veterinary officers said: "Whilst the lifting of the mandatory housing measures will be welcome news to bird keepers, scrupulous biosecurity remains the most critical form of defence to help keep your birds safe. "It is thanks to the hard work of all bird keepers and vets, who have played their part in keeping flocks safe this winter, that we are in a position to take this action."However, the recent cases of avian influenza show that it's more important than ever for bird keepers to remain vigilant for signs of disease and maintain stringent standards of biosecurity." 'Does not solve the crisis'Image caption, Poultry farmer Llyr Jones is spending more money on feeding his hensFarmers welcomed the move but warned that there are still challenges."It's really nice to see the hens outside," said Llyr Jones, a poultry farmer. "Once they've laid their eggs in the morning, the doors open at 9 o'clock and they can have the rest of the day roaming the fields." Mr Jones, who runs the Derwydd farm in Ruthin in north Wales, said the main challenge for farmers now is rising production costs, after the Ukraine war sent prices soaring.Russia and Ukraine are among the world's biggest producers in agriculture and food. Wheat, a core ingredient in chicken feed, has surged in price in recent months.Ukraine war 'catastrophic for global food'Farmers warn Ukraine war will hit UK food pricesFive ways the Ukraine war could push up pricesMr Jones said that since the start of the war, it's costing him an extra Â£400 a day to feed his hens. Rising energy and labour costs have added to the strain. "Unfortunately we can't absorb the costs," he said. His concerns are echoed by the British Free Range Egg Producers Association. Its chief executive, Robert Gooch, said it was "really good news" that shoppers can once again purchase free-range eggs. "But while it's a relief to my members, lifting the housing order does not solve the crisis facing the egg sector," he said. "It will not remove the huge hikes in energy, transport, feed and labour costs they are experiencing. The picture is bleak." Some farmers are calling for retailers to hike egg prices, to help them meet rising costs.But retailers say the market is already tough.Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, said: "Supermarkets source most of their food from the UK and know they need to pay a sustainable price to farmers but are constrained by how much additional cost they can pass onto consumers in this very difficult market." Bird flu fears More than 100 cases of bird flu have been confirmed across the country since late October.The virus is highly contagious and can destroy poultry flocks. The housing measures were announced by Defra last November in an attempt to minimise the chances of poultry and other captive birds coming into contact with infected wild birds. The risk to human health is extremely low, according to the NHS.

They are also asking that bird baths be emptied to prevent the spread of the disease. Aavian influenza—also known as ‘bird flu’—is a virus that can affect many different species of birds. The virus is shed by infected birds through feces and respiratory secretions and is very resilient. The organization said although waterfowl, such as ducks, geese and gulls, and raptors including eagles, hawks and owls are at the highest risk of avian influenza, or bird flu, it can infect all birds. This includes farm animals like chickens and turkeys, but can also affect wild and pet birds. The H5N1 strain is considered highly pathogenic, causing severe illness and death in birds. “On rare occasions, this virus can also cause disease in humans who have been in close contact with infected birds, or heavily contaminated areas,” said Andrea Wallace, manager of wild animal welfare for the BC SPCA. In addition to removing bird feeders and emptying bird baths, the BC SPCA is asking the public to monitor their outdoor surroundings for any signs of sick birds. “Birds may appear lethargic, unusually “fluffed up”, have nasal discharge, or have excessively watery eyes or swelling of the head and eyelids.” Bird feeders can encourage the virus to spread because they are gathering areas for the feathered animals. “Fallen seed is also an especially dangerous source of disease — when birds feed from the ground, they are also exposed to droppings that accumulate below a feeder,” Wallace said. The BC SPCA said it is not necessary to remove hummingbird feeders at this time but the nectar should be changed regularly and cleaner at the same time to prevent deadly fungal outbreaks. On Wednesday, officials said they detected bird flu in two more small herds of poultry in Richmond and Kelowna. The infected facilities were placed under quarantine. The public is asked to report sightings of sick or dead wild birds to the Canadian Wildlife Health Cooperative (CWHC) at 1-800-567-2033.

File Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save Another small poultry flock in Kelowna has tested positive for avian influenza, federal and provincial officials say.The unidentified premises, along with a poultry flock in Richmond, has been put under quarantine by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.These are the third and fourth small flocks in B.C. that have contracted the virus, presumably through contact with infected migrating wild birds. Avian influenza was detected last week among chickens in a Kelowna backyard poultry flock.Poultry producers within a 12 kilometre radius of the infected flocks have been notified and asked to undertake enhanced prevention and preparedness measures. The BCSPCA is asking people to remove their backyard bird feeders and to empty bird baths while the virus is circulating.“Bird feeders can be sites for disease spread because they encourage unnatural congregations of birds and attract other wildlife,” said Dr. Andrea Wallace, manager of wild animal welfare for the BC SPCA, in a news release. “Fallen seed is also an especially dangerous source of disease - when birds feed from the ground, they are also exposed to droppings that accumulate below a feeder.” Hummingbird feeders are less risky, but should be cleaned regularly.The highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus was first detected at a commercial poultry operation in the North Okanagan in mid-April.The public is asked to report sightings of sick or dead wild birds to the Canadian Wildlife Health Cooperative at 1-800-567-2033.

Dark purple zones are primary control zones where Avian flu exists and birds cannot be moved in or out of the zone without permits. Nelson Zandbergen Farmers Forum WATERLOO — Ontario poultry farms have been hammered by the worst outbreak of the Avian influenza virus ever seen in Canada, with flocks infected in nine provinces and 1.725 million birds destroyed as of May 5. That toll includes 425,000 birds culled in Ontario under the watch of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency. The CFIA has counted bird flu (H5N1 virus) outbreaks at 23 Ontario flocks, from late March to May 5. The outbreaks comprise not only commercial chicken meat producers but also farmers producing eggs, turkeys and ducks. Four sites involve small flocks. There are 1,200 chicken meat producers, 430 egg producers and 160 turkey farms in Ontario. In a glimmer of good news, Chicken Farmers of Canada spokesperson Lisa Bishop-Spencer said the rate of increase at least appears to be slowing. “We are seeing a lesser frequency of cases, but it’s still very much a concern among producers,” she emphasized, noting that migrating waterfowl — carriers of the disease — continue to arrive in Ontario. There is hope the virus will “fade away” soon as wild birds move farther north, as has happened during past, smaller outbreaks. Newfoundland and Nova Scotia have not seen a new outbreak since the first quarter of 2022. Source: Canadian Food Inspection Agency, May 5, 2022. In the meantime, the threat posed by the virus — and the damage done — remains a major stressor to Ontario poultry farmers, Bishop-Spencer acknowledged. “These are unprecedented times for the industry.” Comparing the disease to sustaining a barn fire, she said, “It’s very upsetting to have this come onto your farm.” Provincial poultry boards have been fielding a high volume of incoming calls from member producers and they are all asking, “What do I do?” All are closely monitoring their flocks with the instruction to call a vet at the first sign of anything that looks suspicious and all are anxious that their farm won’t be next with an outbreak. Those with confirmed positive cases must watch as the CFIA moves in to ensure their flocks are destroyed. The heartbreaking process includes destroying a flock by filling a barn with carbon dioxide. Workers in HAZMAT suits were spotted outside a poultry farm near Cornwall. (Nelson Zandbergen photo) According to Bishop-Spencer, the carcasses are composted inside the barn, and the CFIA checks to ensure the decomposing bird bodies reach a certain temperature — killing the pathogen — before they are cleaned out of the structure. Chesley-area turkey farmer, and member of the Feather Board Command Centre, Ingrid deVisser said it could be a number of months before an infected barn can be brought back into production. The current disease challenge coincides with rebounding demand for chicken meat, back to levels prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. For consumers, the avian flu situation is not bad enough to mpact supply or prices in grocery stores. Bishop-Spencer pointed out that the supply-managed production of chicken has helped ensure a producer presence across the country. With production more spread out than in the United States, lesser-hit regions could be called upon to supply product to areas where there might be a shortfall. This last occurred during a 2004 avian flu outbreak in B.C., she said, when the Chicken Farmers of Canada hatched a “chicken west” effort to keep that province supplied. The Toronto Star has reported that King Cole Ducks of York Region slaughtered 100,000 of its birds after a recent outbreak. A company official is reported as saying that 80 % of the Canadian duck supply has been affected by avian flu. The contagious sickness is a concern both for its impact on the poultry sector and, according to Public Health Canada, the potential to spark the next human flu pandemic — although transmission from birds to people is considered rare. Human H5N1 infections “have been associated with severe disease and death,” according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. Ontario’s health ministry recommends that individuals living or working on farms monitor themselves for symptoms. North America’s only case in a human was recorded late last month in Colorado. The infected man, a prison inmate, contracted the infection while on work release during a chicken cull at an infected farm. The under-age-40 inmate was reported to have fatigue but was otherwise asymptomatic and is expected to fully recover. Ontario’s agricultural commodity insurer, Agricorp, says it’s ready to deliver support to poultry producers that sign up for coverage. Spokesperson Stephanie Charest pointed out that the deadline for 2022 AgriStability applications and fees was recently extended to June 30. The program was recently tweaked to increase loss coverage from 70 % to 80 % and trigger payment more easily with the removal of a reference margin limit. Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs spokesperson Belinda Sutton also noted that private insurance is available through the Poultry Insurance Reciprocal of Canada.

The research also shows that 73% of the adult population expect the flu to be worse this year than the previous 2 years.The Immunisation Coalition is concerned that Australians may be unprotected as strains of the flu arrive via international travel and are spread through increased domestic travel.Flu circulation is also likely to increase with lockdowns ending, social-distancing being relaxed and greater population movement as people return to workplaces, schools and transportation.Leanne Boase, President of the Australian College of Nurse Practitioners: “We commend everyone for their enormous effort during the pandemic which resulted in such high rates of COVID 19 vaccination, limiting severe disease, and hospitalisations. We urge you not to underestimate influenza, and make sure you have your flu shot this year. Protect yourself, your loved ones, including your children, ahead of what is predicted to be a resurgence of influenza. Together we can reduce the impact.”There are three locations in Cowra where local residents can book in to receive an influenza vaccine for this year’s flu season: Cowra Medical Associates, Medispring Family Medical Centre and Optimal Pharmacy Health Hub (Railway lane). Bookings are essential, with appointments offered on differing days and times.Cowra Medical Associates can be contacted on 6341 1400 and Medispring Family Medical Centre on 6342 2555.
