The announcement was made at an information session at the end of a 4-day Information Meeting on the Composition of Influenza Virus Vaccines, a meeting that is held twice annually.The WHO organizes these consultations with an advisory group of experts gathered from WHO Collaboration Centres and WHO Essential Regulatory Laboratories to analyse influenza virus surveillance data generated by the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System. The recommendations issued are used by the national vaccine regulatory agencies and pharmaceutical companies to develop, produce, and license influenza vaccines for the following influenza season.The periodic update of viruses contained in influenza vaccines is necessary for the vaccines to be effective due to the constant evolving nature of influenza viruses, including those circulating and infecting humans. The WHO recommends that quadrivalent vaccines for use in the 2022-2023 influenza season in the northern hemisphere contain the following: Egg-based vaccinesan A/Victoria/2570/2019 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus;an A/Darwin/9/2021 (H3N2)-like virus;a B/Austria/1359417/2021 (B/Victoria lineage)-like virus; anda B/Phuket/3073/2013 (B/Yamagata lineage)-like virus.Cell culture- or recombinant-based vaccinesan A/Wisconsin/588/2019 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus;an A/Darwin/6/2021 (H3N2)-like virus;a B/Austria/1359417/2021 (B/Victoria lineage)-like virus; anda B/Phuket/3073/2013 (B/Yamagata lineage)-like virus.The WHO recommends that trivalent vaccines for use in the 2022-2023 influenza season in the northern hemisphere contain the following: Egg-based vaccinesan A/Victoria/2570/2019 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus;an A/Darwin/9/2021 (H3N2)-like virus; anda B/Austria/1359417/2021 (B/Victoria lineage)-like virus.Cell culture- or recombinant-based vaccinesan A/Wisconsin/588/2019 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus;an A/Darwin/6/2021 (H3N2)-like virus; anda B/Austria/1359417/2021 (B/Victoria lineage)-like virus Media Contacts WHO Media Team World Health Organization Email: mediainquiries@who.int Related The full technical reportWHO Global Influenza ProgrammeWHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System Regions Africa Americas Eastern Mediterranean Europe South-East Asia Western Pacific Policies Cybersecurity Ethics Information disclosure Permissions and licensing Preventing sexual exploitation Terms of use About us Careers Frequently asked questions Library Newsletters Procurement Publications Contact us Report misconduct Privacy policy © 2024 WHOReal-time tracking of bioluminescent influenza A virus infection in mice | Scientific Reports Skip to main content Thank you for visiting nature.com.

Low vaccine coverage and the occurrence of drug-resistant viral strains highlight the need for new and improved countermeasures. While influenza A virus (IAV) engineered to express a reporter gene may serve as a valuable tool for real-time tracking of viral infection, reporter gene insertion into IAV typically attenuates viral pathogenicity, hindering its application to research. Here, we demonstrate that lethal or even sublethal doses of bioluminescent IAV carrying the NanoLuc gene in the C-terminus of PB2 can be tracked in real-time in live mice without compromising pathogenicity. Real-time tracking of this bioluminescent IAV enables spatiotemporal viral replication tracking in animals that will facilitate the development of countermeasures by enhancing the interpretation of clinical signs and prognosis while also allowing less animal usage.

Seasonal vaccination is the primary method to control and prevent influenza. Although influenza virus vaccines show excellent efficacy in preclinical studies, the effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccines remains at the range of 19–60% over a 10-year period2, highlighting the need for improving the vaccine. Together with the continuous threat of emerging flu pandemics, therapeutic antiviral drugs including neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors, M2 ion channel blockers, viral RNA polymerase inhibitors, and viral endonuclease inhibitors have been developed as countermeasures. These antivirals, however, still need to overcome limitations such as a narrow administration window for effectiveness and proclivity for the emergence of drug-resistant viruses, thus highlighting the need for new or improved countermeasures to combat this continued threat to human life.In vivo imaging of live animals enables real-time monitoring of viral spread and may facilitate new vaccine and antiviral drug development against influenza A virus (IAV). Viral tracking with in vivo imaging may enable dynamic and longitudinal studies about prophylaxis and therapy that are not feasible in a terminal animal model. Specifically, tracking of IAV in animals empowers us to investigate various factors critical to viral replication such as host factors, transmissibility, pathogenicity, and coinfections in a real-time fashion. Importantly, it can also be utilized to reduce the number of animals used in basic and preclinical research by minimizing the need for serial sacrifice studies.Several attempts to establish IAVs carrying fluorescent or bioluminescent proteins for in vivo studies have been made by inserting a reporter gene into nonstructural protein genes such as polymerase basic protein 2 (PB2), polymerase acidic protein (PA), or nucleoprotein (NP)3,4,5,6,7; or structural protein genes such as hemagglutinin (HA) or neuraminidase (NA)8. However, these reporter IAV constructs suffered from diminished replicative ability resulting in attenuation in animal models3,4,5,7,8,9. Although pathogenicity could be recovered by serial passage in mice7,10, the inclusion of adaptive mutations makes it difficult to compare results with published data, thereby limiting the utility of these reporter IAVs in replication and transmission studies. In addition, it is crucial to understand how sensitively the replication of reporter viruses can be tracked during in vivo imaging; however, such characterization is limited with the previously developed IAV reporter viruses.NanoLuc is a luciferase reporter that is derived from deep-sea shrimp (Oplophorus gracilirostris), has 150 times brighter luminescence than the commonly used Renilla and firefly luciferase reporters, and has been used previously in reporter IAVs for in vivo imaging4,5,6,9,10,11. Gaussia luciferase (GLuc) is another bright luciferase used for in vivo imaging of reporter IAVs3,8,12 but has intrinsic autoluminescence that decreases bioluminescence detection in animals making it less sensitive for generating reporter viruses13. As an alternative, NanoLuc Binary Technology (NanoBiT) has been developed as a complementation reporter which includes a small subunit tag (11 amino acids) known as high-affinity NanoBiT (HiBiT) and a larger subunit known as large NanoBiT (LgBiT)14. When LgBiT binds to HiBiT, the combined protein functions like NanoLuc in bioluminescent characteristics. Inserting the small HiBiT tag into the viral genome is less likely to interfere with viral replication but will produce strong bioluminescence when LgBiT is provided exogenously as has been demonstrated previously with viruses in the Flaviviridae family15. A search of the literature identified no previous studies using HiBiT with IAV.We hypothesized that the NanoLuc or HiBiT reporters may be inserted into the IAV genome without loss of virulence thus enabling in vivo bioluminescence towards the study of IAV infection in live animals. The present study aimed to evaluate the bioluminescent reporter gene (NanoLuc) and tag (HiBiT) inserted into the IAV genome. To generate bioluminescent IAV, we inserted the reporters in the background of influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/1934, H1N1 virus (PR8). Here, we showed that insertion of NanoLuc into the C terminus of the PB2 gene resulted in a virus (PB2-C-NanoLuc PR8 IAV) that had comparable virulence with wild-type IAV in mice and sufficient detection sensitivity in the respiratory tract to enable in vivo viral tracking, even at sublethal doses. This suggests that the PB2-C-NanoLuc PR8 IAV will be a useful real-time tracking reporter virus for basic and applied IAV research.ResultsComparison of bioluminescent IAVs carrying the NanoLuc gene or HiBiT tagTo investigate an IAV with a reporter that retained viral replication like wild-type PR8 IAV, the NanoLuc gene or HiBiT tag was inserted into the N- and C-terminal ends of the PB2 or PA gene segment coding regions (Fig. 1a). These gene segments have previously been demonstrated to tolerate reporter genes in the C-terminus3,4,6,16,17, though the resulting IAVs had decreased virulence3,4,16. For the PB2 gene segment, 120 nucleotides (nt) at the N- and C-terminal coding regions are required to maintain packaging efficiency, while 60 nt are required for the PA gene segment3,6,18,19 (Fig. 1a,b). To ensure stability of the NanoLuc gene or HiBiT tag, the original packaging signal sequence within the coding region was swapped, but the amino acid sequence was maintained by introducing silent mutations. For the bicistronic expression of NanoLuc or HiBiT with PB2 or PA, the Thosea asigna virus self-cleaving 2A peptide sequence (T2A) (length, 21 amino acids) was used because of its efficient expression, cleavage, and localization of the second gene in contrast with the commonly used P2A peptide sequence from Porcine teschovirus-120,21,22. When T2A self-cleavage occurs via “ribosomal-skip or STOP&GO mechanism during translation”21, the first protein contains a fusion of 20 amino acids. Therefore, additional N-terminal tagged versions of PB2 or PA gene segments were constructed to discern the effect of residual amino acids on growth properties.Figure 1Generation of bioluminescent PR8 IAV carrying NanoLuc or HiBiT reporters. (a,b) Schematic of viral RNA (vRNA) segments in bioluminescent IAV. NanoLuc (510 nt, blue) or HiBiT (33 nt, pink) was inserted into the N- or C-terminus of IAV protein-coding regions linked by the T2A self-cleaving peptide sequence (63 nt, yellow). Native packaging signal (PS) sequences adjacent to the T2A sequence were replaced with codon swapped (CS) sequences. Diagrams are not to scale. Modified sequences in PB2 and PA segments are presented in Supplementary Fig. 8a,b. (a) PB2 vRNA segments. 3′-PB2 fragments contained 3′-UTR (27 nt), 3′-minimum PS sequence (120 nt), NanoLuc or HiBiT sequence, T2A sequence, and 3′ CS sequence (67% of nt homology to PB2). 5′-PB2 fragments included 5′ CS sequence (66% of nt homology to PB2) where the stop codon was removed, T2A sequence, T2A cleavage site (black triangle), NanoLuc or HiBiT sequence, stop codon (*), 5′-minimum PS sequence (120 nt), and 5′-UTR (34 nt). (b) PA vRNA segments. 3′-PA fragments contained 3′-UTR (24 bp), 3′-minimum PS sequence (60 nt), NanoLuc or HiBiT sequence, T2A sequence, and 3′ CS sequence (71% of nt homology to PA). 5′-PA fragments included 5′ CS sequence (75% of nt homology to PA) where the stop codon was removed, T2A sequence, NanoLuc or HiBiT sequence, stop codon (*), 5′-minimum PS sequence (60 nt), and 5′-UTR (58 nt).

(f) PA-N-HiBiT and PA-C-HiBiT.Full size imageWe attempted to rescue 4 bioluminescent PR8 IAVs containing NanoLuc and 4 HiBiT-tagged IAVs with insertions in the PB2 or PA gene segments as described above using reverse genetics23 and propagate them in Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells. PB2-C-NanoLuc and all 4 HiBiT-tagged PR8 IAVs (PB2-N-HiBiT, PB2-C-HiBiT, PA-N-HiBiT, and PA-C-HiBiT) were rescued successfully and maintained infectivity in MDCK cells after 3 passages (Fig. 1c). Attempts to rescue N-terminal NanoLuc variants from PB2 and PA segments were unsuccessful after 3 attempts. The PA-C-NanoLuc IAV grew just above the limit of detection in MDCK cells but lost infectivity during the second passage (Fig. 1c). These results suggest that the longer length of the NanoLuc gene (510 nt) as compared to the HiBiT tag negatively affected PB2 or PA gene segment packaging. In support of this assumption, IAVs tagged at the PB2-C terminus with longer reporters such as monomeric oxidizing environment-optimized green fluorescent protein (moxGFP; 714 nt)23 and improved Causes recombination (iCre; 1050 nt)24, had lower infectious titers than PB2-C-NanoLuc IAV (Supplementary Fig. 1).To verify incorporation of NanoLuc or HiBiT-tagged segment (PB2 or PA) into the virus, MDCK cells were infected with rescued IAVs (PB2-C-NanoLuc and all 4 HiBiT-tagged viruses) at low multiplicity of infection (MOI, 0.001), and cell lysates were collected at 1 day after inoculation. MDCK cells infected with PB2-C-NanoLuc IAV expressed PB2 and NanoLuc proteins confirming that the NanoLuc gene was incorporated into virions (Fig. 1d). Similarly, PB2-N-HiBiT, PB2-C-HiBiT, PA-N-HiBiT, and PA-C-HiBiT segments were expressed in MDCK cells infected with these reporter IAVs (Fig. 1e,f). Incorporation of HiBiT tagged segments was confirmed by luciferase assay in MDCK cells after infection (Fig. 3, Supplementary Fig. 2).Growth properties of PB2-C-NanoLuc and HiBiT-tagged IAVsTo access the replicative ability of rescued bioluminescent IAVs, plaque formation of reporter IAVs was compared with wild-type PR8 IAV in MDCK cells. PB2-C-NanoLuc and all HiBiT IAVs visually formed plaques like wild-type PR8 IAV, indicating that NanoLuc or HiBiT tag did not hinder the ability of bioluminescent IAVs to form plaques (Fig. 2a). To ascertain that the viral plaques contain NanoLuc protein, the viral plaques of PB2-C-NanoLuc IAV were immunostained with anti-NP and anti-NanoLuc antibodies. Among 105 PB2-C-NanoLuc IAV plaques/foci immunostained with anti-NP antibody, 103 plaques/foci were immunostained with anti-NanoLuc antibody. The two plaques/foci which express only NP but not NanoLuc were tiny foci (3–4 cells stained with NP), thus it is likely that they originated from defective particles which didn’t contain PB2-C-NanoLuc segments. This observation is consistent with a previous study demonstrating that about 90% of IAV particles contained both NP and PB2 segments25. To further investigate growth properties of rescued bioluminescent IAVs, multi-step replication of reporter IAVs was compared with wild-type PR8 IAV in MDCK cells at low MOI (0.001) and 37 °C vs. 33 °C to simulate replication in the mouse upper respiratory tract26. All of the PB2 bioluminescent IAVs replicated similarly to wild-type PR8 IAV, while PA-N-HiBiT and PA-C-HiBiT replication was significantly decreased as compared to wild-type (Fig. 2b–e). The T2A self-cleaving sequence in the bicistronic expression system cleaves into a 20 amino acid segment that fuses to the first bicistronic protein while 1 amino acid residue fuses to the second bicistronic protein22. Throughout the multi-step replication experiments, no significant difference in replication was observed between N-terminal and C-terminal PB2 HiBiT tagged IAVs (Fig. 2b,c), suggesting that the 20 amino acid residues in the C terminus of the PB2 protein following T2A self-cleavage did not hamper viral replication. Since replication of PB2-C-NanoLuc, PB2-N-HiBiT, and PB2-C-HiBiT was most like wild-type PR8 IAV at 37 °C and 33 °C, we concluded that IAVs tagged in the PB2 gene segment, but not the PA gene segment, were most likely to exhibit near wild-type virulence in mice and only these 3 bioluminescent IAVs were assessed in subsequent studies.Figure 2Growth kinetics of bioluminescent IAVs in MDCK cells. (a) Plaque formation of bioluminescent IAVs in MDCK cells. We compared plaque formation from bioluminescent IAVs at 4 days post inoculation. Confluent MDCK cells in 12-well plates were infected with IAVs (MOI, 0.0002), and plaques were stained with crystal violet, and imaged. PB2-C-NanoLuc and all HiBiT IAVs formed plaques like wild-type PR8 IAV, indicating that the NanoLuc or HiBiT tags did not hinder plaque formation of bioluminescent IAVs. (b,c) Multi-step growth curves of PB2-C-NanoLuc (blue), PB2-N-HiBiT and PB2-C-HiBiT (pink), and wild-type PR8 IAVs (gray) at low multiplicity of infection (MOI, 0.001). (b) At 37 °C, all PB2 bioluminescent IAVs replicated productively, like wild-type PR8 IAV. (c) At 33 °C, all PB2 bioluminescent IAVs replicated productively, like wild-type PR8 IAV. (d,e) Multi-step growth kinetics of PA-N-HiBiT and PA-C-HiBiT (pink) and wild-type PR8 IAVs (gray) at low MOI (0.001). (d) At 37 °C, PA-N-HiBiT and PA-C-HiBiT replication were significantly less than wild-type IAV. *p < 0.05. (e) At 33 °C, PA-N-HiBiT and PA-C-HiBiT replication were significantly less than wild-type IAV. Data represent the mean ± SEM of results determined in 3 independent experiments, each performed in triplicate. The limit of detection was 10 PFU mL−1. *p < 0.05.Full size imageStability of NanoLuc and HiBiTAlthough transgenes flanked by repeated packaging signal sequences in IAVs may be unstable and lost during replication27,28, the instability could be resolved by introducing silent mutations in the coding region of the packaging signal sequence3,6. Therefore, the packaging signal sequence in the coding region of bioluminescent IAVs was codon swapped (Fig. 1a,b). Sequencing of serially passaged PB2-C-NanoLuc IAV showed that the NanoLuc gene was stably maintained until the sixth passage, when a single amino acid change was introduced at P115S (Table 1). For PB2-N-HiBiT and PB2-C-HiBiT, the PB2 gene sequence was stably maintained through 5 passages and HiBiT through 6 passages in MDCK cells. As point mutations in the HA gene were observed in the third passage in MDCK cells, all stocks of reporter viruses were prepared before the third passage (Table 1). Stability of NanoLuc or HiBiT tag in PB2-C-NanoLuc, PB2-N-HiBiT, and PB2-C-HiBit was further confirmed after 3 sequential passages in MDCK cells by demonstrating that functional luciferase activity was preserved (Fig. 3).Table 1 Mutations in bioluminescent influenza A viruses sequentially passaged in MDCK cells.Full size tableFigure 3Functional stability of luciferase activity in bioluminescent IAVs after sequential passage. PB2-C-NanoLuc (blue) and PB2-N-HiBiT and PB2-C-HiBiT (pink) IAVs were sequentially passaged in MDCK cells at 37 °C. Each passaged IAV was serially diluted, and IAV luciferase activity was determined in MDCK cells at 12 h after inoculation. Stability of NanoLuc or HiBiT tag in PB2-C-NanoLuc, PB2-N-HiBiT, and PB2-C-HiBit was confirmed after 3–6 sequential passages of these IAVs in MDCK cells. RLU with NanoLuc substrate from MDCK cells infected with wild-type PR8 IAV (black) was plotted as a reference. Data reported as mean ± SD (N = 3). PFU plaque forming units, RLU relative luciferase units.Full size imageIn vivo imaging of PB2-C-NanoLuc, PB2-N-HiBiT, and PB2-C-HiBiT IAVsTo determine which of the 3 remaining bioluminescent PR8 IAVs were most efficiently tracked in vivo, real-time imaging of bioluminescent IAVs was performed at 3 and 6 days after intranasal challenge. Bioluminescent signal from PB2-C-NanoLuc was localized to the trachea and both lungs at 3 days post challenge and spread to a wide area of the left lung while disappearing from the trachea at 6 days (Fig. 4a). In contrast, no bioluminescence was detected in mice infected with PB2-N-HiBiT or PB2-C-HiBiT at 3 or 6 days post challenge, even when the amount of LgBiT protein was doubled (Fig. 4a). Control mice infected with wild-type PR8 IAV did not show any bioluminescence as was expected (Fig. 4a).Figure 4In vivo imaging of PB2-C-NanoLuc, PB2-N-HiBiT, and PB2-C-HiBiT IAVs. Female C57BL/6 mice aged 6 to 8 weeks were infected with 2000 PFU of wild-type PR8 or 20,000 PFU of PB2-C-NanoLuc, PB2-N-HiBiT, or PB2-C-HiBiT IAVs intranasally (2 mice per each virus). Luciferase substrates for PB2-C-NanoLuc or PB2-N-HiBiT and PB2-C-HiBiT were prepared and injected retro-orbitally for imaging. The mice were imaged using an in vivo imaging system (IVIS) and viral titers were determined in lung homogenates prepared from euthanized animals on day 6 post challenge. Black lines, mean values. (a) IVIS imaging from NanoLuc or HiBiT-LgBiT complex at 3 and 6 days post infection. Radiance, defined as the number of photons per s per square cm per steradian (p s−1 cm−2 sr−1), is shown on the heat maps. (b) In vitro viral titers in lung homogenates determined by plaque assay (PFU g−1). The limit of detection: nasal turbinates, 136 PFU g−1; trachea, 188 PFU g−1; lung, 65 PFU g−1. (c) In vitro viral titers in lung homogenates from PB2-N-HiBiT, or PB2-C-HiBiT IAV infected mice determined by luciferase assay on MDCK cells. The infected lung homogenates showed active luciferase signals, indicating that HiBiT peptide carried by IAVs caused luciferase activity when substrate and LgBiT protein were supplemented. The limit of detection in lung, 34,783 RLU (MDCK) g−1. PFU plaque forming units, RLU relative luciferase units.Full size imageTo confirm that reporter IAVs replicated in mice, infected mice were euthanized after imaging at 6 days post challenge and infectious titers were determined in lung tissue by plaque assay. All 3 bioluminescent IAVs had similar titers in lung tissue as compared to wild-type PR8 IAV (Fig. 4b). Furthermore, HiBiT-tagged IAVs that were collected from lung tissue exhibited luciferase activity upon infection of MDCK cells and exposure to HiBiT substrate and LgBiT protein (Fig. 4c), suggesting that the absence of bioluminescence with PB2-N-HiBiT and PB2-C-HiBiT in vivo was due to insufficient delivery of LgBiT protein to infected cells in the trachea and lungs.Virulence of bioluminescent PB2-C-NanoLuc IAVGiven that PB2-C-NanoLuc PR8 IAV had optimal imaging results for real-time tracking in vivo, we evaluated maintenance of pathogenicity by challenging mice with tenfold serial dilutions of virus. Although mock-infected mice or mice infected with 2 PFU of PB2-C-NanoLuc IAV gained body weight over the 14 days in life period, mice infected with 20 or 200 PFU of wild-type or PB2-C-NanoLuc IAV lost body weight during the first week after infection (Fig. 5a,b). Most mice infected with PR8 IAV at 200 PFU and all mice infected with 2000 PFU of wild-type or PB2-C-NanoLuc IAV were moribund and euthanized (Fig. 5c,d). Survival curves were similar for mice infected with wild-type or PB2-C-NanoLuc PR8 IAV (Fig. 5c,d) supporting that the insertion of the NanoLuc gene linked with a T2A cleavage sequence in the C terminus of PB2 did not attenuate the virulence of PR8 IAV in mice.Figure 5Virulence of wild-type and PB2-C-NanoLuc PR8 IAVs in mice. Female C57BL/6 mice aged 6 to 8 week were infected intranasally with wild-type or PB2-C-NanoLuc PR8 IAV at various doses or no virus (mock) in sterile PBS and observed for 14 days. Body weight reported as percentage of initial body weight (mean ± SD). (a) Body weight in cohorts of mice given mock infection or infected with wild-type PR8 IAV. Body weight decreased initially in infected mice but increased after 7 days in mice infected with 20 or 200 PFU of wild-type IAV that survived. (b) Body weight change in cohorts of mice infected with PB2-C-NanoLuc PR8 IAV. Body weight decreased initially in infected mice but increased in mice infected with 20 or 200 PFU of PB2-C-NanoLuc IAV that survived beyond 7 to 9 days. (c) Survival in mice given mock infection or infected with wild-type PR8 IAV; 5 of 6 mice infected with 200 PFU (83%) died, and all 6 mice infected with 2000 PFU (100%) died within 9 days. The 50% mouse lethal dose (MLD50) of wild-type PR8 IAV was 95 PFU. (d) Survival in mice infected with PB2-C-NanoLuc PR8 IAV; 3 of 5 mice infected with 200 PFU (60%) died, and all 6 mice infected with 2000 PFU (100%) died within 8.5 days. The MLD50 of PB2-C-NanoLuc PR8 IAV was 160 PFU. Log-rank test showed no significant difference between survival curves from wild-type vs PB2-C-NanoLuc IAV at 200 PFU (p = 0.26) and 2000 PFU (p = 0.42). Time to loss of 25% of initial body weight was similar between mice challenged with wild-type (200 PFU, 7–8 days post infection; 2000 PFU, 5–9 days post infection) and PB2-C-NanoLuc PR8 IAV (200 PFU, 7–9 days post infection; 2000 PFU, 6–8.5 days post infection). PFU plaque forming units.Full size imageReal-time tracking of PB2-C-NanoLuc IAV in the mouse respiratory tractTo monitor how bioluminescent imaging in vivo correlated with body weight as a proxy for the presence of IAV infection, bioluminescence imaging was performed over time in mice infected with PB2-C-NanoLuc IAV. Representative bioluminescence images from infected mice showed variation in spatiotemporal bioluminescence in vivo, suggesting that IAV replication varied with time and anatomical respiratory region in different mice at the same or different doses (Fig. 6a).Figure 6Real-time in vivo tracking of bioluminescent PB2-C-NanoLuc IAVs and spatiotemporal resolution of IAV replication kinetics in the mouse respiratory tract. (a) Bioluminescence from mice infected with PB2-C-NanoLuc IAV (2, 20, 200, or 2000 PFU) in the virulence study from 3 to 9 days after infection, expressed as radiance (p s−1 cm−2 sr−1). Each row of images was acquired longitudinally from 1 mouse. Differences in bioluminescence between mice were observed in the nasal turbinates (2000 PFU), trachea (200 PFU), and right or left lung (20 PFU). †Imaging performed before mouse was euthanized because of loss of > 25% of initial body weight.

Relative bioluminescence flux at each region was the bioluminescence photon flux normalized to the mean flux from 3 mock-infected mice at the nasal turbinates (3.0 × 103 ± 8.7 × 102 photons s−1), trachea (2.4 × 104 ± 3.6 × 103 photons s−1), lung (5.8 × 104 ± 7.4 × 103 photons s−1), and whole body including head and torso (1.2 × 105 ± 1.2 × 104 photons s−1). Additional measurements were done at 2 and 5 days after infection to fill gaps resulting from the limited retro-orbital administration of substrate. There were 1 to 7 mice imaged at each time, except that there were no surviving mice at 9 days after infection with 2000 PFU. Data are shown as truncated violin plots with median (line) and first and third quartiles (dashed lines). (c) Relative flux for each IAV dose from the nasal turbinates, trachea, lung, and whole-body (median ± 95% confidence interval). Body weight (mean ± SD) after infection with bioluminescent IAV was replotted from Fig. 5b to facilitate comparison of the time course of relative flux and body weight. The natural history of influenza viral infection and progression in animals included incubation (no body weight drop after infection), prodrome (initial body weight drop), invasion (rapid or continuous loss of body weight), and convalescence periods (gaining of body weight) and recovered healthy condition (steady status of body weight). The lethal phase (red points) was defined by the loss of more than 25% of initial body weight.Full size imageTo specifically assess the feasibility of tracking bioluminescent IAV at various respiratory sites, determination of normalized bioluminescence flux from the nasal turbinates, trachea, lungs, and whole body showed that photon flux was detected above baseline in infected vs. mock-infected mice at all anatomical respiratory regions and doses of infection (Fig. 6b). Importantly, this included infection at a sublethal dose of 2 PFU that showed no visible bioluminescence upon imaging (Fig. 6a). With sublethal doses of IAV (2 and 20 PFU), body weight began to decrease during the prodromal period as early as 4 days after infection but continued to recover during convalescence (Fig. 6c). At 2 PFU, relative flux signals were observed at 2 days after infection and didn’t return to baseline until 9 days post infection, long after body weight had recovered. At 20 PFU, relative flux was also observed as early as 2 days post infection and increased between days 4 and 7 as body weight decreased. Body weight began to increase after 7 days while the relative flux decreased. At 200 PFU, body weight decreased until 9 days after infection. The relative flux at the lung did not increase above 10, but relative flux at the nasal turbinates and trachea increased to > 10 and rapidly decreased to 1 by 9 days after infection, at the beginning of convalescence. At 2000 PFU, body weight began to decrease during the prodrome period at 1 day post infection. Further, it decreased substantially during the invasion period until 9 days after infection. Mice began to die when the relative flux at the lung was greatest from 6 to 9 days after infection. Interestingly, the relative flux did not increase above 10 at any anatomical respiratory regions with sublethal doses (2 and 20 PFU) but did increase to > 10 in at least two anatomical respiratory regions with lethal doses (200 and 2000 PFU), suggesting that relative flux could be used to define the severity of IAV infection and ultimately the prognosis.To compare the spatiotemporal replication of PB2-C-NanoLuc IAV as a function of infectious dose, relative flux from the nasal turbinates, trachea, and lung was plotted for each dose (Supplementary Fig. 3). Relative flux from lethal dose groups increased to > 10 at the nasal turbinates (200 and 2000 PFU), trachea (200 PFU), and lung (2000 PFU). Given that the relative flux from nasal turbinates and trachea in the 200 PFU group was > 10 for only 1 day, and the flux from nasal turbinates and lung in the 2000 PFU group was > 10 for 4 days, it seems that the duration of increased relative flux > 10 is inversely correlated with survival. Although the relative flux from the whole body (head and torso) had similar patterns to flux from the lungs (Fig. 6b,c), the application of relative flux from each respiratory site is of benefit to explain the dynamic replication of IAV throughout the respiratory tract. For example, while the lung flux at 20 and 200 PFU was < 10, the high flux in the nasal turbinates and trachea (> 10 relative flux) at 200 PFU distinguished the severity of infection from infection with 20 PFU (Supplementary Fig. 3).Infectious virus titers from the respiratory tract correlated with in vivo and in vitro bioluminescenceTo evaluate the correlation between infectious titers from the respiratory tract vs. photon flux in vivo and luciferase signals in vitro, we measured MDCK cell plaque formation and luciferase activity in tissue homogenates from the nasal turbinates, trachea, and lung (Fig. 7a). Bioluminescent IAV in the lung peaked at 106–107 PFU g−1 at 3 to 5 days after infection with 200, or 2000 PFU. While bioluminescence imaging and flux measurement from the nasal turbinates, trachea, and lung indicated replication sites of IAV and corresponded to body weight changes and prognosis (Fig. 6c), infectious titers from lung tissue did not distinguish the 200 vs. 2000 PFU IAV doses and lethal outcomes (Fig. 7b). The 3 variables for plaque assay (PFU g−1), luciferase assay of supernatant [relative luciferase units (RLU) (Sup) g−1], and luciferase assay of MDCK cells [RLU (MDCK) g−1] strongly correlated with each other throughout the various dose groups (Fig. 7c), the trachea, and lung (Fig. 7d), but not the nasal turbinates where RLU (Sup) g−1 correlated poorly with PFU g−1 and RLU (MDCK) g−1. Since PFU g−1 correlated strongly with RLU (MDCK) g−1 in the nasal turbinates (Pearson correlation coefficient, 0.92), the poor correlation in the nasal turbinates was most likely due to measurement of RLU (Sup) g−1. Homogenates of nasal turbinates are composed primarily of bone tissue, which may cause bias in RLU (Sup) normalized by the weight of nasal turbinates. In contrast, the flux measurement from the different dose groups and respiratory tract correlated moderately with PFU g−1, RLU (Sup) g−1, and RLU (MDCK) g−1 (Fig. 7c,d).Figure 7Correlation of in vitro measurements from tissue homogenates and in vivo bioluminescence from live mice. (a) In vitro measurements from plaque assay (PFU g−1), in vitro luciferase assay (RLU (Sup) g−1 and RLU (MDCK) g−1), and in vivo bioluminescence (relative flux) for infection with 200 and 2000 PFU. After infection with 200 or 2000 PFU, nasal turbinates, trachea, and lung were collected from 2 mice each at 3 and 5 days after infection. Additional tissues were harvested from 3 mice (200 PFU dose) and 6 mice (2000 PFU dose) which were moribund after terminal IVIS imaging. Mean values are connected by a line. *Mice that had no in vivo imaging because of severe dehydration and tachypnea.

(c,d) Pearson correlation coefficient matrix for plaque assay (PFU g−1) and in vitro luciferase assay for supernatant (RLU (Sup) g−1) and MDCK cells (RLU (MDCK) g−1), and nonparametric Spearman correlation coefficient for flux (p s−1) from 63 measurements in different infectious dose groups and respiratory organs. p values are shown in Supplementary Table 1. Number of data for comparison: 2 PFU, 12 data; 20 PFU, 12 data; 200 PFU, 18 data; 2000 PFU, 21 data; nasal turbinates, trachea, and lung, each 21 mice. PFU plaque forming units, RLU relative luciferase units, Sup supernatant.Full size imageTo determine the linear detection range of PB2-C-NanoLuc IAV in MDCK cells, serially diluted wild-type or PB2-C-NanoLuc IAV were used to infect MDCK cells, and luciferase activity was measured at 12 h after infection. The background noise level was like luciferase activity from wild-type IAV, and there was a strong correlation between luciferase activity from PB2-C-NanoLuc IAV-infected MDCK cells vs. infectious viruses in the inoculum (Fig. 8a). This strong correlation was also observed when trypsin was omitted from the culture medium (Supplementary Fig. 4), supporting that the linear detection range of luciferase assay results were not affected by the presence of trypsin in culture media. Within the linear range of detection, the luciferase activity from MDCK cells and supernatant combined was most comparable to that from MDCK cells alone (Fig. 8b). Supernatants alone also had luciferase activity, consistent with the presence of NanoLuc protein, however, this activity was 1000-fold less than the activity from MDCK cells suggesting that luciferase activity was primarily associated with the cells (Fig. 8b).Figure 8Linear detection range of PB2-C-NanoLuc IAV. Results reported as mean ± SD relative luciferase units (RLU) for triplicate measurements. (a) Linear detection range of PB2-C NanoLuc IAV in MDCK cells. Serially diluted samples (25 μL each) of wild-type or PB2-C-NanoLuc IAV were inoculated onto MDCK cells in white 96-well plates. At 12 h after inoculation, equal volume of luciferase substrate (80 μL) was added and luminescence was measured from MDCK cells and supernatant combined. There was strong correlation between measured luciferase activity vs infectious IAV titer from 101 to 104 PFU per 25 μL of inoculum (r2, 0.995; p < 0.0001). (b) Comparison of luciferase activity between MDCK cells and supernatants of MDCK cultures infected with PB2-C-NanoLuc IAV. To determine the source of the luciferase activity in the infected MDCK cultures, we separated MDCK cells and culture supernatants and measured the luciferase activity separately. At 12 h after inoculation of wild-type or PB2-C-NanoLuc IAV onto MDCK cells, luciferase activity was measured from MDCK cells and supernatant combined (squares; same method as in (a)), MDCK cells only (triangles; replacing with 80 μL PBS before adding 80 μL substrate), and supernatant only (upside-down triangles; adding 80 μL substrate); sum of data from MDCK only and supernatant only (circles). Within the linear range of detection (101–104 PFU per 25 μL inoculum), the luciferase activity from MDCK cells and supernatants combined was most comparable to that from MDCK cells alone. (c) Linear detection range of PB2-C NanoLuc IAV in supernatants. Luciferase activity of serially diluted 80 μL of wild-type or PB2-C-NanoLuc IAV was measured without infection to MDCK cells (same method of supernatant only as in (b)). Luciferase activity correlated with IAV PFU concentration linearly at PFU > 103 per 80 μL supernatant (r2, 0.999; p < 0.0001). (d) Stocks of wild-type and PB2-C-NanoLuc IAV were filtered (100 kDa cutoff), and the retentates and filtrates were adjusted to the original volume (1 mL) and analyzed via luciferase assay and Western blot for PB2 and nucleoprotein (NP) as a marker for the presence of IAV. Cropped blots are displayed. Full-length blots are presented in Supplementary Fig. 9c.Full size imageLuciferase activity from PB2-C-NanoLuc IAV stocks alone, which were collected from the supernatant of infected MDCK cells, was detected linearly at a concentration of greater than 103 PFU per 80 μL (Fig. 8c). To elucidate where the luciferase activity was coming from, centrifugal filtration of wild-type and PB2-C-NanoLuc IAV stocks was employed followed by Western blot of the stock vs. the retentate vs. the filtrate. Western blot showed that most of the IAV remained in retentate after filtration (Fig. 8d). However, luciferase activity was notable in both the filtrate and the retentate (Fig. 8d), suggesting that free NanoLuc protein was released into supernatants during the lytic replication of IAV when producing stocks. After 2 additional rounds of centrifugal filtration in separate experiments, IAV was isolated to the retentate and remained associated with some luciferase activity, suggesting that the NanoLuc protein was associated with IAV virions in some way (Supplementary Fig. 5a,b). Given that most of the bioluminescence signal arose from NanoLuc protein associated with infected cells as opposed to free or IAV-associated NanoLuc proteins (Fig. 8b,d), flux was not strongly correlated with PFU g−1 from various respiratory regions, which measured the amount of infectious IAVs present in the airway (Fig. 7d).To determine whether bioluminescent IAV released into the airway may be detected and quantified in real-time with the in vitro luciferase assay, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was collected during the terminal procedure and evaluated (Fig. 9). The BALF samples from mice infected with 20, 200, and 2000 PFU showed poor correlation between PFU and RLU (Sup) (Pearson’s r, 0.14) or between PFU and RLU (MDCK) (Pearson’s r, − 0.08). There were no PFU or RLU measured with infection at 2 PFU supporting that no infectious virus was present in the BALF of mice infected at this level. Real-time titration of IAV in BALF by luciferase assay on supernatant would save time over the plaque assay in MDCK cells which may require 12 h to 2 days of assay running time but should be applied only as a quick reference for viral shedding since the plaque assay is more quantitative.Figure 9In vitro measurements on BALF samples to compare plaque vs luciferase assay. BALF was collected during the terminal procedure from 1 mouse or 2 mice at each inoculation dose (2, 20, 200, or 2000 PFU) of IAV and evaluated with in vitro plaque assay (PFU mL−1) and luciferase assay on supernatant (RLU (Sup) g−1), and MDCK cells (RLU (MDCK) g−1). Mean, black line. Hollow circles indicate measurements that were below the limit of detection of BALF samples for plaque assay (15 PFU mL−1) or luciferase assay on supernatant (625 RLU (Sup) mL−1) or MDCK cells (8000 RLU (MDCK) mL−1).

PB2-C-NanoLuc IAV maintained efficient replicative ability in MDCK cells, and virulence in mice was not compromised. The combination of in vivo imaging and photon flux measurement from the various anatomical regions of the respiratory tract demonstrated sensitive tracking of bioluminescent IAVs in mice over time, and furthermore bioluminescent signals from animals challenged at different doses explicitly corresponded to body weight changes and prognosis. In contrast, traditional infectious titers collected from lungs (Fig. 7b) did not distinguish the various dose levels and lethal outcomes. Together, these data support that real-time imaging of IAV replication will serve as an excellent research tool to aid in the development of vaccine and antiviral therapy where body weight changes alone had been traditionally used for monitoring clinical progress.As opposed to previous studies attempting to develop bioluminescent IAVs expressing NanoLuc, the self-cleaving T2A peptide sequence was used in this study due to its efficient expression and cleavage of the second gene in a bicistronic construct. The T2A peptide sequence allowed correct subcellular localization of both proteins expressed from the bicistronic message, compared to the P2A peptide sequence from Porcine teschovirus-120,21,22. In other studies, the GLuc reporter and the F2A self-cleavage sequence of foot-and-mouth disease virus were inserted into the C-terminus of PB2 to generate PR8-Gluc IAV; however, the virulence of that virus was significantly attenuated compared with wild-type PR8 virus3. This attenuation was likely due to inefficient cleavage of the F2A sequence in the PB2-GLuc polyprotein that affected viral replication29 and further supported the use of T2A as an alternative in these studies.Importantly, the PB2-C-NanoLuc IAV was passaged stably in MDCK cells at least through 3 passages when point mutations were noted in the HA gene sequence. Point mutation in the NanoLuc gene of PB2-C-NanoLuc IAV was not observed until the sixth passage in MDCK cells, suggesting that marginal selective pressure was present, albeit weak. Therefore, it was concluded that all bioluminescent IAVs should be used within 3 passages from recovery in MDCK cells to avoid any unwanted mutation.While previously reported bioluminescent IAVs with NanoLuc in the PA-C segment were rescued in the background of A/California/04/2019 and A/WSN/334,5,6, we were unable to recover PA-C-NanoLuc IAV in the background of A/PR8/34. When the NanoLuc gene was replaced with a small peptide (HiBiT) to generate PA-C-HiBiT, the recombinant IAV replicated efficiently, suggesting that the length of the inserted sequence in the C terminus of PA affects the viability of IAV replication in MDCK cells. We speculated that changes in the length of the PA segment could have affected the results, including the repeated packaging signal sequence (60 nt for our study vs. 50 nt for others) and self-cleaving peptide (63 nt in T2A for our study vs. 66 nt in P2A for others). In addition, the bioluminescent IAVs in these previous studies were propagated in chicken embryonated eggs which often results in the acquisition of adaptive changes30,31. We purposefully chose propagation in MDCK cells for that reason.We also demonstrated that use of the small HiBiT peptide tag as opposed to larger reporters was beneficial in generating bioluminescent IAVs through successful recovery of IAVs tagged with HiBiT in both the N- and C-terminus of the PB2 and PA gene segments. In each case, the HiBiT tag was stably maintained through passage, and efficiently released via T2A self-cleavage to enable a complex with LgBiT and emission of bioluminescent signals in infected MDCK cells. Only the PB2-N-HiBiT and PB2-C-HiBiT IAVs replicated as efficiently as wild-type IAV in cells (Fig. 2b,c), providing further support that the PB2 gene segment of PR8 IAV, as opposed to the PA gene segment, is more tolerant to insertions. PB2-N-HiBiT and PB2-C-HiBiT IAVs also infected mice similarly to wild-type IAV (Fig. 4b); however, we were unable to image PB2-N-HiBiT and PB2-C-HiBiT IAVs in mice likely due to insufficient delivery of LgBiT protein to infected cells in the respiratory tract. To overcome this obstacle, HiBiT tagged IAVs could be administered to LgBiT-expressing transgenic mice or regular animals that express LgBiT via viral vectors. Alternatively, secretion or targeting self-cleaved HiBiT peptide via T2A sequence to the plasma membrane by signal peptide sequence may bypass the difficulty of delivering LgBiT protein to cells in live animals. Regardless, current data generated here support use of PB2-N-HiBiT and PB2-C-HiBiT IAVs to track infection in tissue culture cells.For mice infected with PB2-C-NanoLuc IAV, we showed that the luciferase assay was able to detect free and virus-associated NanoLuc protein in the supernatant from tissue homogenates and BALF. However, the real-time luciferase assay of supernatant from BALF is only beneficial as a quick reference for monitoring viral shedding in transmission studies, for example, since plaque titration in MDCK cells is more quantitative. Bioluminescence from cell-free NanoLuc proteins was almost negligible compared with the total bioluminescence measured from live animals suggesting that NanoLuc protein remains predominantly associated with infected cells. Consequently, the bioluminescence signal (photon flux) was only modestly correlated with infectious titer (PFU). PFU g−1 after infection was generally higher at 3 than 5 days after infection (Fig. 7a), while photon flux was consistently higher at 5–6 days after infection (Fig. 6c). Previous studies showed similar discrepancies between PFU g−1 and flux4. As the most intense bioluminescence signal from NanoLuc protein originated from cells infected with bioluminescent IAVs, the expression of NanoLuc during infection may necessitate a slight delay. Lastly, we demonstrated that real-time tracking in live mice showed the intensity and duration of flux, which were indicative of the extent and duration of airway infection with IAV, provided a better prediction of disease progression and prognosis than traditional infectious titers in respiratory organs.For some of the images shown in Fig. 6a, we observed different infection patterns from each mouse in the same infectious dose group even though our IVIS imaging experiments were performed using the same infection and imaging procedure. Specifically, all mice were infected intranasally after isoflurane anesthesia using a SomnoSuite (Kent Scientific) at a consistent isoflurane concentration in the anesthetic chamber. Each animal, however, reacted slightly differently to the isoflurane. For example, some animals fell asleep more deeply and more rapidly. IAV in the inoculum is administered intranasally while animal’s inhale. Thus, we speculate that slightly different anesthetic planes and associated breathing rates could result in slightly different infection patterns. The various infection patterns observed in our IVIS imaging agree with natural infection in humans or animals. However, when comparing total flux among different infectious doses, overall infection patterns were distinct per infectious dose, as shown in Fig. 6b,c.PB2-C-NanoLuc IAV infection of tissues other than the respiratory tract was not noted in these IVIS imaging studies, though infectious wild-type PR8 can be recovered from the brain of infected mice (unpublished data). We speculate that PB2-C-NanoLuc IAV would also spread to the brain at high doses and previous study have shown that furimazine, NanoLuc substrate, can reach the brain across the blood–brain barrier32. Thus it is likely that the blue emission (maximum wavelength, 460 nm) of NanoLuc bioluminescence may be suboptimal for in vivo imaging of deep tissues33. Further study is justified with PB2-C-NanoLuc IAV using improved substrates such as modified furimazine with red-shifted emission34 that may improve tracking sensitivity in deeper tissues. Alternatively, in vivo imaging of deep tissues may be improved by enhancing bioluminescent intensity by using substrates which improved the solubility of furimazine35. Recent advancements in firefly luciferase (FLuc) resulted in approximately 13 times brighter red-shifted emission by substituting 28 amino acids in FLuc to generate AkaLuc36. AkaLuc allowed deep tissue imaging up to the single-cell level of bioluminescence in living animals and could be used as an alternative to NanoLuc in bioluminescent IAV. However, the relatively large size of AkaLuc (1653 nt), may restrain IAV replication when inserted into the PB2-C terminus.Lastly, both BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice are typically used for pathogenicity studies in IAV infection. However, C57BL/6J mice are more susceptible to select IAV strains such as 2009 pandemic H1N1 IAVs37. As most transgenic mice have been developed from C57BL/6 mice, the similar pathogenicity of wild-type and PB2-C-NanoLuc PR8 IAVs in C57BL/6 mice may enable functional evaluation of host proteins in live animals. For example, PB2-627K adaptation in avian IAVs is important to take advantage of mammalian ANP32A protein for viral polymerase assembly38,39,40, and our real-time tracking IAV may be used to evaluate the mechanisms of ANP32A adaptation in live mice. Also, with tracking sensitivity for the heterogeneous replication of IAV in live animals, PB2-C-NanoLuc PR8 IAV may enable the evaluation of immune response heterogeneity in the dirty mouse model, which was proposed to refine misleading vaccine results from inbred mice41,42,43.MethodsPlasmids and cellsThe A/PR8/34 reverse genetics plasmids were provided by Yoshihiro Kawaoka (University of Wisconsin-Madison), including 8 pHH21 plasmids (pHH21-PB2, PB1, PA, NP, HA, NA, M, and NS) for production of viral RNAs and 4 pCAGGS plasmids (pCAGGS-PB2, PB1, PA, and NP) for expression of viral polymerase complex and NP23. Reporter genes NanoLuc, moxGFP, and iCre were amplified from the plasmids pUAS-NanoLuc, pmoxGFP and paavCAG-iCre, respectively, provided by Robert Campbell (Addgene plasmid #87696; http:/2t.net/addgene:87696; RRID: Addgene_87696)44, Erik Snapp (Addgene plasmid #68070; http:/2t.net/addgene:68070; RRID: Addgene_68070)23, and Jinhyun Kim (Addgene plasmid #51904; http:/2t.net/addgene:51904; RRID: Addgene_51904)24.293T cells (ATCC, CRL-11268) were grown in Dulbecco Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) (ATCC) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (ATCC) and 1% penicillin–streptomycin (Gibco). MDCK cells (London Line, FR-58) were obtained (International Reagent Resource, Influenza Division, WHO Collaborating Center for Surveillance, Epidemiology and Control of Influenza, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) and grown in Eagle Minimum Essential Medium (EMEM) containing 1% nonessential amino acids (Gibco), 1% GlutaMAX-1(Gibco), 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Gibco), 1.5 g L−1 sodium bicarbonate (Gibco), and 10% FBS. MDCK cells were gradually adapted to grow in serum-free medium (OptiPRO SFM, Gibco) with 2% supplement (GlutaMAX-1) for 5 passages over 1 month. Since PR8 replication in MDCK cells did not differ between maintenance media [EMEM containing 1% nonessential amino acids, 1% GlutaMAX-1, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 1.5 g L−1 sodium bicarbonate, 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), and 0.5 μg mL−1 trypsin treated with N-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone (TPCK-trypsin)] vs serum-free medium (Supplementary Fig. 6), we used serum-free medium for the entire study to avoid FBS washing steps before inoculation. All cells were grown in an incubator with 5% carbon dioxide and limited to 20 passages.Generation of bioluminescent IAVsThe PB2 and PA fusions with NanoLuc and HiBiT were created in the pHH21 plasmid (In-Fusion Cloning, Takara Bio) (Fig. 1a,b). Four DNA fragments (3′-PB2-, 5′-PB2-, 3′-PA-, and 5′-PA-DNA) were synthesized (GENEWIZ). The other parts of the native sequences from PB2 or PA were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the templates of pHH21-PB2 or pHH21-PA, and 2 fragments from each 3′- and 5′-side were cloned into the pHH21 plasmid (In-Fusion Cloning, Takara Bio). The gene segments containing NanoLuc, moxGFP and iCre (Supplementary Fig. 1), were generated by replacing the HiBiT tag sequence with the reporter genes. Plasmid constructions were designed using software (SnapGene, version 5.1), and all constructed plasmids were sequenced to ensure that there were no unwanted mutations (GENEWIZ).Reporter IAVs were rescued using reverse genetics methods by transfection with a 12 plasmid system of IAV A/PR8/34 (H1N1) strain in 293T cells as described previously (Supplementary Fig. 7)23. For reporter IAVs that could not be rescued on the first attempt, we made 2 additional rescue attempts by modifying the regular reverse genetics procedure with optimized viral rescue conditions including optimized amounts of pCAGGS plasmid, pHH21 plasmid, transfection reagent, incubation time, and coculture time in 293T and MDCK cells after transfection (Supplementary Fig. 7a–e).Serial viral passage in MDCK cells for stability experiments were performed (MOI, 0.001). Confluent MDCK cells in T75 flasks were infected with bioluminescent PR8 IAVs for 1 h at 37 °C. The inoculum was removed and MDCK cells were washed twice with PBS. Fresh growth medium (OptiPRO SFM supplemented with 2% GlutaMAX-1 and 0.5 μg mL−1 of TPCK-treated trypsin; 10 mL) was added, and the infected MDCK cells were incubated at 37 °C for 3 days. Harvested IAVs were filtered with a 0.45 μm polyethersulfone filter (Fisherbrand), divided into aliquots, and stored at − 80 °C. All stocks of reporter IAVs were made in MDCK cells within 3 passages of growth for 3 days at 33 °C and sequenced after PCR amplification of all 8 segments to ensure that there were no unwanted mutations (GENEWIZ).Multi-step growth curveConfluent MDCK cells in T25 flasks were infected with bioluminescent PR8 IAVs or wild-type PR8 (MOI, 0.001) for 1 h at 37 °C. The inoculum was removed and the cells were washed twice with PBS. Fresh medium (5 mL) containing TPCK-trypsin (0.5 μg mL−1) was added, and the infected MDCK cells were incubated at 37 °C or 33 °C for 4 days. At various times, supernatant (0.3 mL) was collected and replaced with fresh media (0.3 mL). Collected supernatants were cleared by centrifugation (3000 rpm for 5 min) and stored at − 80 °C until viral titration was done by plaque assay.Plaque assayPlaque assay was done in MDCK cells in 24- or 48-well plates. At 1 h after inoculation at 37 °C, infected MDCK cells were overlayed with a 2: 1 mixture of growth medium and microcrystalline cellulose (3.6% Avicel, RC-591, DuPont) including TPCK-treated trypsin (0.5 μg mL−1) and incubated at 37 °C. At 3 days post infection, MDCK cells were fixed with 10% buffered formalin for 1 h. After removing the overlay, MDCK cells were permeabilized with PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and 20 mM glycine for 20 min. The plates were washed three times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST), and plaques were immunostained with a 1: 3000 dilution of anti-IAV-NP antibodies (MAB8257 and MAB8258, 1: 1 mixture, EMD Millipore) and peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (SeraCare). Immunostained plaques were treated with peroxidase substrate (TrueBlue, SeraCare) according to the manufacturer’s protocol and counted manually using an inverted light microscope (Laxco). The limit of detection in 24-well plates was 10 PFU mL−1 while that in 48-well plates was 15 PFU mL−1. Plaques from different IAVs were compared for size in 12-well plates by infecting cells at a MOI of 0.0002, incubation for 4 days under 0.8% agarose overlay, and staining with crystal violet (0.5%) (Fig. 2a).Tissue collected from mice was homogenized in a bead homogenizer with a 1: 1 mixture of 1.4 mm and 2.8 mm ceramic beads in cold PBS containing 1% penicillin–streptomycin (Gibco) (trachea, 0.5 mL; nasal turbinates or lung, 1 mL). After homogenization (3 consecutive cycles, 30 s each) and chilling on ice (30 s), samples were centrifuged (5000 rpm) for 5 min at 4 °C. Cleared supernatants were divided into aliquots and stored at − 80 °C until titration. The limit of detection varied with tissue or fluid (nasal turbinates, 136 PFU g−1; trachea, 188 PFU g−1; lung, 65 PFU g−1; BALF, 15 PFU mL−1).In vitro luciferase assayNanoLuc activity was evaluated in confluent MDCK cells in white 96-well plates that were infected with serially diluted IAVs (25 μL) for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing twice with PBS (100 μL per wash), growth medium (80 μL) containing TPCK-treated trypsin (0.5 μg mL−1) was replaced, and plates were incubated for 12 h at 37 °C. Luciferase substrate (Nano-Glo, Promega) was prepared according to the manufacturer’s protocol (1: 50 ratio of substrate and buffer), added to each well (80 μL per well), and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. After shaking (2 min), luminescence was measured with a plate reader (Synergy 2, BioTek) with 1 s integration time and auto gain. NanoLuc activity in the supernatant without MDCK cell infection was determined by mixing supernatant (80 μL) with luciferase substrate (Nano-Glo; 80 μL), incubation for 10 min at room temperature, and measurement of luminescence.In vitro luminescence was measured from mouse tissue samples and BALF. The limit of detection varied with sample source in MDCK cells [nasal turbinates, 72,727 RLU (MDCK) g−1; trachea, 100,000 RLU (MDCK) g−1; lung, 34,783 RLU (MDCK) g−1; BALF, 8000 RLU (MDCK) mL−1] and supernatants [nasal turbinates, 5682 RLU (Sup) g−1; trachea, 7813 RLU (Sup) g−1; lung, 2717 RLU (Sup) g−1; BALF, 625 RLU (Sup) mL−1]. We determined HiBiT and LgBiT luciferase activity from IAV-infected MDCK cells by adding reagents (80 μL) prepared by mixing LgBiT protein, lytic substrate, and lytic buffer (1: 2: 100) (Nano-Glo HiBiT Lytic Detection System, Promega) and measuring luminescence according to the manufacturer’s protocol.Western blotWhole-cell lysates from mock- or virus-infected (MOI, 0.001) MDCK cells were collected at 24 h after inoculation in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer containing protease inhibitors (Takara Bio), electrophoresed under reduced denaturing conditions (Bolt Bis–Tris Plus gel, Invitrogen), and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Membranes were blocked for 1 h with 5% dried skim milk (Research Products International) in PBST and incubated with polyclonal rabbit anti-PB2 (PA5-32220, Invitrogen), rabbit anti-PA (PA5-32223, Invitrogen), rabbit anti-NP (PA5-32242, Invitrogen), monoclonal mouse anti-NanoLuc luciferase (MAB10026, R&D systems), or mouse anti-β-actin (AM4302, Invitrogen) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse (5220-0341, SeraCare) or antirabbit IgG (31460, Invitrogen). Specific proteins were detected using a chemiluminescent substrate (SuperSignal West Pico PLUS, Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer's recommendations and photographed (ChemiDoc XRS, Bio-Rad Laboratories).IAVs in supernatants (1 mL) were separated with a filter unit (100 kDa cutoff) (Amicon Ultra-4 Centrifugal Filter Unit, Millipore Sigma) by centrifugation (swinging-bucket rotor; 4000×g) at 25 °C for 15 min. The retentate and filtrate were collected separately and adjusted to 1 mL with PBS. After aliquots were taken for luciferase determination and Western blot, 90% (volume/volume) of remaining retentates were processed for a second and third filtration. Western blot samples from supernatants (original stock, retentates, and filtrates) were prepared in sample buffer (4× Bolt LDS, Invitrogen) and sample reducing agent (10× Bolt, Invitrogen) and denatured for 10 min at 70 °C according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Whole cell lysates were processed similarly. Substrates were used to detect NP (SuperSignal West Pico PLUS Chemiluminescent Substrate, Thermo Scientific) or PB2 (SuperSignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate, Thermo Scientific).Virulence in miceAnimal experiments and procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the University of South Alabama, carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations, and reported in accordance with the ARRIVE guidelines (https://arriveguidelines.org). Female C57BL/6 mice (age, 6–8 week) (Charles River) were maintained in the University of South Alabama vivarium. Mouse cohorts (randomly divided into 5 or 6 mice per group) for the virulence study and in vivo imaging were infected with wild-type or bioluminescent PR8 IAV (50 μL) intranasally under isoflurane anesthesia (SomnoSuite, Kent Scientific) at doses ranging from 0 PFU (mock infection) to 2000 PFU per mouse. All mice were monitored twice daily for 2 weeks to evaluate virulence including daily body weight and signs of morbidity and mortality. Mice that lost more than 20% of initial body weight were monitored three times daily including additional body weight measurement. Mice that lost more than 25% of initial body weight were humanely euthanized and the date recorded. The 50% mouse lethal dose (MLD50) was calculated by Reed and Muench method45. The natural history of influenza viral infection in animal was defined according to the change in body weight as a representative of clinical progression in a mouse including incubation, prodrome, invasion, and convalescence periods and recovered healthy condition (Fig. 6c).In vivo imagingIn vivo bioluminescence imaging was determined in mock-infected mice (PBS) or mice infected with bioluminescent PR8 IAVs using an in vivo imaging system (IVIS 200 Spectrum In Vivo Imaging System, PerkinElmer) with software (Living Image, version 4.7, PerkinElmer). For initial comparison of PB2-NanoLuc, PB2-N-HiBiT, and PB2-C-HiBiT IAV, each IAV (20,000 PFU) was inoculated into mice intranasally (two mice per virus), and imaged at 3 and 6 days post infection. Since the reference MLD50 for mice infected with PR8 IAV was ~ 100–300 PFU7,46, the dose of wild-type PR8 IAV was 2000 PFU per mouse. Mice were lightly anesthetized with isoflurane (SomnoSuite), and the hair was shaved from the neck and upper torso before 1st IVIS imaging. Fresh substrate (Nano-Glo, Promega) diluted 1: 10 with sterile PBS (total, 100 μL) was injected retro-orbitally47 with a 28-gauge, ½-inch needle. According to the IACUC approved protocol at the University of South Alabama, retro-orbital injection could be attempted only twice per eye per mouse after IAV infection, thus imaging was limited to 4 time points along with one additional injection for terminal imaging. For in vivo imaging of HiBiT-tagged IAV at 3 days post infection an injection mixture (total, 100 μL) was prepared with LgBiT protein, HiBiT lytic substrate, and sterile PBS at a ratio of 0.5: 1: 10, or 1: 1: 10. For 6 days post infection only the 1: 1: 10 ratio was used. This injection mixture was also delivered retro-orbitally as described above. Imaging was performed for PB2-C-NanoLuc within 30 s after substrate injection, and for HiBiT at 5 min after substrate injection, with emission filter open, field of view at 6.6 cm, f-number at 1, binning factor at small (4), and at an exposure time of 330 s (or an exposure time of 300 s for IVIS imaging in Fig. 4). Photon flux (number of photons per s) was determined from the nasal turbinates, trachea, and lung using software (Living Image, version 4.7, PerkinElmer), and relative flux was defined as the photon flux normalized by the mean flux from mock-infected mice.StatisticsStatistical analyses were performed with software (Prism, version 9.1.2, GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Comparisons were made using repeated-measures 2-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Greenhouse–Geisser correction and Dunnett multiple comparisons test for multi-step growth data, log-rank test for survival curves, Pearson correlation for plaque assay and luciferase assay on supernatants and MDCK cells, and nonparametric Spearman correlation for flux. Correlation coefficients and p values were displayed in a correlation matrix and table. ReferencesIuliano, A. D. et al.

CDC believes that the current risk to the general public's health from HPAI A(H5N1) virus in the U.S. is low. However, some people may be at a higher risk of infection than others based on their exposures to infected birds, particularly poultry workers. CDC Update February 22, 2022—Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) viruses have been detected in U.S. wild birds and commercial and domestic poultry, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspective Service (APHIS). Avian influenza is a disease of birds caused by infection with avian influenza A viruses (bird flu viruses). However, avian influenza A virus infection of people is rare. CDC believes that the current risk to the general public's health from HPAI A(H5N1) virus in the U.S. is low. However, some people may be at a higher risk of infection than others based on their exposures to infected birds, particularly poultry workers. There is existing federal guidance related to bird flu exposures for different groups of people, including hunters [ 297 KB, 2 pages], poultry producers, responders to bird flu outbreaks in birds [353 KB, 18 pages], the general public, as well as health care providers. While these bird flu outbreaks are largely an animal health issue, CDC is working closely with USDA to monitor for potential human infections and taking other routine preparedness and prevention measures in anticipation of possible human infections. On the animal health side, the U.S. Department of Interior and USDA are the lead federal departments for outbreak investigation and control of bird flu in wild birds, and USDA APHIS is the lead agency for such activities in domestic birds. As a reminder, it is safe to eat properly handled and cooked poultry and poultry products in the United States. The proper handling and cooking of poultry and eggs to an internal temperature of 165˚F kills bacteria and viruses, including HPAI A(H5N1) viruses. Wild birds can be infected with HPAI A(H5N1) viruses without showing symptoms, but these viruses can cause illness and death in domestic poultry. USDA has publicly posted genetic sequencing for several of the recently detected U.S. HPAI A(H5N1) viruses. These viruses are from clade 2.3.4.4b1, which is the predominant HPAI A(H5N1) virus worldwide at this time. Ancestors of these HPAI A(H5N1) viruses first emerged in southern China and led to large poultry outbreaks in Hong Kong in 1997, which resulted in 18 human infections. The outbreak was controlled, but the HPAI A(H5N1) virus re-surfaced in 2003 to spread widely in birds throughout Asia, and later in Africa, Europe, and the Middle East. Human Infections with Avian Influenza A viruses Infected birds shed avian influenza A viruses in their saliva, mucous and feces. Human infections with bird flu viruses can happen when enough virus gets into a person's eyes, nose, or mouth, or is inhaled. People with close or prolonged unprotected contact with infected birds or virus contaminated environments may be at greater risk of bird flu virus infection. Illnesses in humans from avian influenza A virus infections have ranged from mild (e.g., eye infection, upper respiratory symptoms) to severe illness (e.g., pneumonia) that can result in death. The spread of avian influenza A viruses from one infected person to a close contact is very rare, and when it has happened, it has not led to sustained spread among people. Since 2003, 19 countries have reported more than 860 total human infections with HPAI A(H5N1) viruses to the World Health Organization (WHO), with about 53 percent of those resulting in death. The most recent human infection with HPAI A(H5N1) virus was reported in the United Kingdom in January 2022 in association with exposure to domestically kept infected birds. No human infections with highly pathogenic avian influenza A viruses2 have been detected to date in the United States; however, sporadic human infections with HPAI A(H5N1) bird flu viruses resulting from close contact with infected birds/poultry would not be surprising given past human infections that have occurred sporadically in other countries. CDC will work with state partners to minimize the possibility of human infection and, if one occurs, minimize the risk to others. What is CDC Doing? Based on available gene sequencing, CDC has determined: CDC has produced a candidate vaccine virus (CVV) that is nearly identical to the recently detected HPAI A(H5N1) viruses in birds that could be used to produce a vaccine for people, if needed. These viruses are susceptible to currently available antiviral medications used to treat influenza. These viruses can be detected using CDC's diagnostic tools for seasonal influenza viruses which are used at more than 100 public health laboratories in all 50 U.S. states and internationally as well. CDC is working with USDA and state public health partners to monitor for potential infections in exposed persons in the states where H5N1 bird flu virus detections in poultry and backyard flocks have occurred. If human infections with H5N1 bird flu virus are identified, CDC will assist with surveillance, contact tracing, and steps to reduce further spread, in the affected jurisdictions. CDC will also alert clinicians and other health professionals through clinician outreach networks. CDC has guidance documents including recommendations for personal protective equipment and information for people exposed to birds infected with avian influenza A viruses and guidance for testing and treatment of suspected cases to prevent severe illness and transmission to other people. CDC is currently reviewing and updating this guidance as needed. Risk Assessment Ongoing CDC will continue its ongoing assessment of the risk posed by these viruses, including conducting laboratory experiments to further characterize the HPAI A(H5N1) virus. For example, continuing to look for genetic markers that might result in greater transmissibility to and between people or suggest reduced susceptibility to antivirals, as well as changes in the virus that might require the development of a new CVV. While sporadic bird-to-human infections would not raise the public health risk assessment, identification of multiple instances of HPAI A(H5N1) virus spread from birds to people, or of markers of mammalian adaptation in the virus, would raise CDC’s risk assessment. These changes could indicate the virus is adapting to spread more readily from birds to people. If human-to-human spread with this virus were to occur, that would raise the public health threat because it could mean the virus is adapting to spread better between people. Note that sustained human-to-human spread is needed for a pandemic to occur. On This Page CDC Update Human Infections with Avian Influenza A viruses What is CDC Doing?

How are flu vaccines made? Posted: by Mia Rozenbaum on 24/02/22 More on these Topics: FERRETS INFLUENZA SHEEP Human influenza (flu) is a very fickle virus. Because circulating flu viruses are constantly changing, the composition of the flu vaccines made to protect humans against them have to evolve accordingly. The current flu varieties are reviewed every year and this provides guidance to the vaccines makers – although virus evolution can outrun the production cycle so virus vaccines vary in their effectiveness. Targeting the right virus Every year the predominant strain of the influenza virus evolves. Changes often occur in the proteins on the surface of the virus. This affects its antigenic properties, which means that any immune protection built up by a previous encounter with the virus is often rendered useless because the body can no longer recognise the flu virus. Scientists seek to predict these changes to create new vaccines that can protect populations at risk. “We have a global system consisting of about 150 laboratories in 125 countries around the world monitoring their influenza viruses,” explains John McCauley, Director of the Worldwide Influenza Centre at The Francis Crick Institute. “In a global effort, the WHO network called Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System shares data and clinical samples to try to identify the next virus most likely to cause an epidemic.” The researchers analyse the antigenic properties of circulating viruses, in particular their ability to bind to red blood cells and infect cell tissue culture. To do so they need an antiserum. It is made by taking the virus of interest and infecting a ferret with it. “Ferrets are used because they mount a similar immune response to humans. Moreover, when the human influenza virus is inoculated into a ferret, it doesn’t need to change to replicate in it, whereas if it infects a mouse, the virus becomes mouse adapted,” explains McCauley. After the ferret mounts an antibody response and recovers from the disease, its blood is collected. The blood contains antiserum which is used to assess the properties of the circulating virus, ie how the virus is recognised antigenically, and whether the antiserum can recognise and/or neutralise other or new variants or groups of virus variants. Determining whether the antiserum is effective or not against circulating flu viruses will help predict influenza epidemics and how the flu vaccines need to be updated. “This happens every year, throughout the year, for different viral strains. Our laboratory uses perhaps 50 ferrets in a year for making these antiserums,” adds McCauley. “But it is a shared resource, and the global data from different WHO collaborating centers helps assess and define the best vaccine for the following season.” This has to be done at least six months before flu season because you have to allow time for vaccine production and delivery. Potency tests After the viral strain is selected but before the vaccines go to production, they have to go through a series of tests to make sure the amount of viral strain used in the vaccine is effective. “The regulators have to do potency tests to make sure that the vaccine is what it says it is, in the amount that it says it is,” explains McCauley. Sheep are inoculated with the particular viral strain of interest to develop antibodies against it that are then harvested. “This is more like a vaccination or an immunisation. It isn’t an infection,” says McCauley. This potent antibody serum is used to assess the quality and the quantity of the new vaccines. All human influenza vaccines have to undergo a potency test. Production Once the new vaccine has been shown to work, it has to be mass-produced. There are two ways of manufacturing a flu vaccine: an egg-based method; and a method that uses tissue cultures. For the past 80 years, much of the world has relied on chicken eggs for the production of influenza vaccines. It is the most common way that flu vaccines are made. The selected viral strains are injected and grown in fertilised hen eggs. The virus replicates in the fluid of the egg and is then harvested. The viruses are either inactivated or attenuated before they are purified and used in each and every phial of vaccine. McCauley explains: “The eggs are embryonated (fertilised) eggs. In the UK, their use for vaccine production doesn’t fall under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act for two reasons. Firstly they are used for manufacturing - not animal scientific procedures - and therefore follow a different set of regulations. Secondly, the embryos, rarely over 14 days old, are not counted under the act. If for some reason, to improve viral replication or isolation, embryos older than 14 days are used, the UK and European laws with respect to animals used in research are applied.” There is also a cell-based production process for flu vaccines that was approved by the FDA in 2012. Instead of using an egg, the virus is grown in mammalian (usually dog) or insect cells. Despite being the cheaper method, the proportion of egg-based vaccines is slowly decreasing in proportion in favour of cell-based vaccines. “Especially over the last 10 years, there has been a lot more emphasis on moving away from eggs as a production platform for a number of reasons,” comments McCauley. “When you inoculate a virus into an egg it generally does change, but it’s been recognised that you’re probably better off, at least for some subtypes, not using it. I suspect that over the next few years, cell-culture based vaccines will be favoured.” He adds: “Ideally in the future, the whole process would be cut down. We’d like to be able to deduce more from viral genetics and predict all the antigenic properties of a virus from its gene sequence which wouldn’t use animals at all. This is how most of the coronavirus vaccines have been produced. But we’re not in a position where we can move away from having to really validate our claims or our predictions. We want to be right or as right as you can be. So the work we do is still important in the whole production process.” More on these Topics: FERRETS INFLUENZA SHEEP Last edited: 14 March 2022 15:02 Back to News Share Related articles Ferret Ferret 10 facts Bird flu in cows: is it a human problem?

Hospitalization rates of respiratory, cardiovascular and diabetic events were estimated from Denmark and England’s electronic databases and stratified by age, comorbidity and influenza vaccination status. We included a seasonal average of 4.5 million Danish and 7.2 million English individuals, 17 and 32% with comorbidities. Annually, approximately 1% of Danish and 0.5% of English individuals were hospitalized for selected events, ~50% of them respiratory. Hospitalization rates were 40–50-fold and 2–10-fold higher in those >50 years and with comorbidities, respectively. Our findings suggest that a pragmatic RCT using non-specific endpoints is feasible. However, for outcomes with rates <2.5%, it would require randomization of ~100,000 participants to have the power to detect a rVE difference of ~13%. Targeting selected groups (older adults, those with comorbidities) where frequency of events is high would improve trial efficiency.

Randomized control trials (RCTs) have, in recent years, relied on laboratory confirmed influenza as a study endpoint to demonstrate the efficacy of influenza vaccines2. However, there is a growing body of evidence that influenza is associated with a broader spectrum of non-respiratory events including cardiovascular, neurological and other complications3,4,5. If influenza virus infection precipitates these events, vaccination should be expected to prevent a proportion of them6. Limited evidence of the value of influenza vaccination at preventing non-respiratory outcomes exists based on observational studies, meta-analysis of RCT data and reanalysis of study safety data7,8,9.RCTs are the most valid study designs to demonstrate causal relationships10; but including non-specific endpoints in a traditional RCT may require large sample sizes because only a proportion of captured non-respiratory events would be influenza-associated [and therefore vaccine-preventable]. Results would also be sensitive to unpredictable and poorly-understood, time-lagged relationships between influenza and related outcomes or complications which could ‘dilute’ vaccine efficacy/effectiveness (VE)11. Differentiated influenza vaccines have demonstrated improved immunogenicity and protection for older adults and some studies have included non-specific cardiovascular or other secondary events to illustrate the full public health value of these vaccines as compared with traditional influenza vaccines12,13,14,15. Studies comparing two vaccines measure relative VE (rVE) which, using an efficacious comparator, report smaller effect sizes and therefore require even larger sample sizes to demonstrate superior protection from influenza-associated cardiovascular and non-respiratory events.Pragmatic trials, which typically measure outcomes using real world data from existing databases or public health registers, may be a feasible method of randomizing interventions in hundreds of thousands of study participants and therefore increase power to measure rVE against non-specific outcomes in a cost-effective manner16,17. Their sample sizes are dictated by the estimated rVE and incidence rate of the outcome under assessment. These studies would be feasible if it is logistically and financially possible to randomize and vaccinate the necessary sample size within a single or multiple healthcare systems from which outcomes could be reliably captured.We conducted a retrospective study using electronic medical records from Denmark and England to estimate the incidence rate of cardiovascular, respiratory and exacerbation of diabetes events in adults ≥18 years, hospitalized during influenza season, to guide future pragmatic RCTs exploring broader, clinically-important, influenza-associated endpoints. We then estimated the sample size requirements to conduct a pragmatic RCT under different population inclusion and rVE scenarios and discussed the feasibility of conducting such studies.ResultsDemographics and influenza vaccination coverage rateFrom Denmark, the study cohort aged ≥18 included a seasonal average of 4,469,268 individuals, 50.7% female. Overall, 17% of the study population had ≥1 high risk condition, increasing from 5.7% in those 18–34 years to 43% in those ≥75 years (Table 1). From England, the cohort included a seasonal average of 7,212,471 people of whom 50.5% were female. In the overall population, 32% had ≥1 high risk condition, increasing from 16.7% in the 18–34 years to 63% in those ≥75 years. Cardiovascular, diabetes, immunocompromised, asthma and other respiratory conditions were the most common high-risk conditions in both countries. Influenza vaccination coverage rates (VCR) captured in these healthcare databases was 13% in Denmark and 24% in England, increasing in the populations aged ≥75 to 55 and 78%, respectively (Fig. 1; Supplementary Fig. 1). VCR was 6–10 fold higher in people with high-risk conditions vs those without in populations aged <65. This difference was much smaller in older adults: in Denmark 59% of adults aged ≥75 with high-risk conditions were vaccinated vs 52% of those without; in England the corresponding proportions were 82 and 72% (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 3).Table 1 Seasonal average study population (#) and percentage (%) by age group and high-risk conditions, Denmark (2010/11 to 2017/18) and England (2010/11–2018/19).Full size tableFig. 1: Annual average influenza vaccination coverage rates by age group in individuals with and without high risk conditions from Denmark and England.Individuals with record of influenza vaccination between August 1st and Jan 31st of each season from Denmark (2010/11–2017/18) and England (2010/11–2018/19).Full size imageOutcome rates in vaccinated and unvaccinated individualsA total of 375,870 hospitalizations for any study outcome were captured over eight influenza seasons in Denmark and 325,799 hospitalizations over nine seasons in England (Table 2). Hospitalization rates varied by age group in Denmark from a low of 119 (95% CI: 117; 121) per 100,000 population in the 18–34 years age group, increasing ~17-fold to 2037 (2024; 2050) in the 65–74 year age group and ~40-fold to 4772 (4749; 4796) in the ≥75 years age group. In England rates in those aged 18–34 were 49 (48–50) per 100,000; 1013 (1006; 1021) (21-fold higher) in those 65–74 years old and 2,545 (2532; 2557) (~52x higher) in those aged ≥75 years.Table 2 Seasonal average number (#) and incidence rates (IR) of selected hospitalized outcomes per 100,000 population by age group for the total study population, Denmark (from 2010/11–2017/18) and England (from 2010/11–2018/19).Full size tableInfluenza hospitalization rates varied between seasons in Denmark from 2 per 100,000 in the 2011/12 season to 52 per 100,000 in the 2017/18 season; and in England from 0.6 per 100,000 in 2011/12 to 33 per 100,000 in 2017/18. Inter-seasonal variation in cardiovascular or diabetic outcome groups was less pronounced, normally varying by <20%.Outcome rates were higher in influenza vaccine recipients than non-recipients particularly in younger individuals in whom vaccination was less common, giving rise to IRRs between vaccine recipients and non-recipients which were nearly always >1 (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Tables 4 and 5). In Denmark, the IRR for all outcomes in the 18–34-year-old age group was 19.4 (95% CI: 18.1; 20.5) and declined in progressively older groups to 1.13 (1.12–1.14) in the ≥75 year old group. In England, the trend was similar with an IRR of 8.3 (95% CI: 8.0–8.7) in the youngest group, declining to 1.10 (95% CI: 1.08; 1.11) in the oldest. These trends were broadly similar across outcome groups with high IRRs in younger age groups declining to ~1 in those aged ≥75 years.Fig. 2: Incidence rate ratios (log scale) of average seasonal outcome rates in influenza vaccinated vs unvaccinated populations in Denmark and England, by age group.Error bars represent mean ± SEM. Underlying data in Supplementary Tables 4 and 5.Full size imageOutcomes in individuals with existing high-risk conditionsOf the annual average of 46,984 hospitalizations captured in Denmark, 30,377 (65%) occurred in individuals with ≥1 high risk condition, an IR of 4014 (95% CI: 3998–4030) per 100,000, compared to 810 (807–813) in those without high risk conditions (Supplementary Table 6). Similarly, in England, most (81%) hospitalizations were in individuals with high risk conditions for an IR of 1271 (1266–1275) compared to 141 (140–142) in those without high-risk conditions (Supplementary Table 7). Among individual high risk groups, people with respiratory conditions experienced the highest rates of any hospitalization in both England and Denmark giving IRRs vs individuals with no high risk conditions of 17.5 (17.4–17.7) in Denmark and 46.3 (45.8–46.7) in England (Fig. 3, Supplementary Tables S8 and S9). IRRs in individuals with ≥1 high risk condition were highest in the 18–34-year-old age group (7.3 in Denmark and 9.5 in England), an effect driven by low hospitalization rates in healthy younger adults, and declined in older age groups. Significantly elevated incidence rates were observed in at-risk populations irrespective of their age.Fig. 3: Incidence rate ratios (log scale) of total hospitalizations in individuals with any high-risk condition or specified high risk conditions vs those with none, by age group in Denmark and England.Error bars represent mean ± SEM.Full size imageSample size for a pragmatic RCTUnder different rVE assumptions, a range of incidence rate scenarios (which we assumed as attack rates) representing the frequency of events reported above and a total sample size of 100,000, the power to conclude rVE >0 in a RCT varied from ~7% to ~100% (Fig. 4). With attack rates <0.5% or rVE <7%, power was low irrespective of other parameters. To achieve a power of 80% to ascertain a rVE of 10%, the frequency of events to be used as endpoints would need to be ≥1.5% in a population of at least 200,000 people. Rare event rates (<1%) as seen in certain populations would require even higher sample sizes for a similar expected rVE.Fig. 4: Power to demonstrate relative vaccine efficacy >0% under different rVE, attack rate and sample size assumptions.Power calculated by exact method, based on binomial distribution of cases in investigational group among overall number of cases.

Selected attack rates reflect the range of incidence rates of events as estimated in our study (IR 1000/100,000 individuals = attack rate of 1%).Full size imageDiscussionOur analysis over 8 years in Denmark and 9 years in England showed that ~1% of Danish and ~0.5% of English individuals were hospitalized for selected health events that could be associated with influenza every season, with rates varying significantly according to age and the presence of high-risk medical conditions. Among these events, respiratory hospitalizations were the most commonly seen in patients of all ages; the proportion of cardiovascular events increased markedly with age; diabetic exacerbations were exceedingly rare; and influenza as a primary diagnosis was reported in <2% of hospitalizations, a proportion which varied by season, synchronous with recorded epidemics18. Unsurprisingly, hospitalizations were more common in older adults: respiratory and cardiovascular hospitalizations were ~40 fold and ~100-fold higher in those aged ≥75 than in those aged 18–34 years.The presence of high-risk medical conditions was strongly associated with hospitalization particularly in younger individuals but, even in older adults, high risk conditions were associated with a 2–3-fold elevated rate of hospitalization. Younger adults with cardiovascular or respiratory conditions experienced 10–50-times more hospitalizations than comparable individuals with no comorbidities, underlining the importance of chronic disease management in these vulnerable groups, irrespective of their age. The presence of high-risk conditions has been shown to elevate risk of severe and hospitalized influenza outcomes, these individuals benefit most from influenza vaccination, and could therefore be considered priorities for inclusion in influenza vaccine studies19,20. Hospitalization rates were up to 20-fold higher in younger influenza vaccine recipients compared with unvaccinated groups of the same age, most likely because vaccination is indicated only for high-risk groups in this age. Across all ages we observed <50% of high risk individuals received influenza vaccination annually, as is common in European countries21, and it is likely that only patients at highest risk, in frequent contact with health services for example, receive annual influenza vaccination. This confounding by indication or health care seeking bias—whereby baseline health condition rather than vaccination status predicts the frequency of healthcare events—has been well-described in the influenza VE literature22,23. The magnitude of disparity in event rates between vaccine recipientson-recipients we observed highlights the challenges of confounder adjustment in observational VEVE studies, and therefore the need for randomized studies, to reliably measure the performance of influenza vaccines24.This study was conducted to improve planning of rVE studies by identifying populations likely to suffer hospitalizations and therefore offer reduced sample sizes. For example, in Denmark the population with high-risk conditions experienced ~4x higher rate of outcomes than those without, corresponding to an improvement in power from ~30% to ~90%, with a sample of 50,000 if the true rVE is around 15%. To achieve the same power in the population without high-risk conditions would require >200,000 study participants and therefore incur significantly greater resources and may be unfeasible in many settings. Whether or not such a study is feasible would depend on the size of eligible population within a participating healthcare system, the ability to randomize that population into treatment groups and the frequency of the outcome of interest. Individually-randomized trials are more labor-intensive to conduct if a very large sample size is required to receive vaccination during a short period, which is the case for influenza vaccination campaigns that start shortly before the season17. There are wide variations in influenza season intensity, and studies may need to be conducted over a longer period if conducted in mild seasons.Targeting populations at highest risk, in whom outcome rates were higher, would therefore improve efficiencies at the risk of reducing generalizability of study results, but because only high-risk and older adults are recommended for influenza vaccination in most countries, limiting inclusion may offer a feasible and relevant population for study10. Conversely, enrolling a highly comorbid population would result in a high background rate of non-specific events which are not vaccine-preventable, thereby ‘diluting’ and reducing rVE as endpoints become less specific, particularly in seasons with low influenza circulation where the proportion of attributable events would be low. This dilution effect may explain a recent study in patients with high-risk cardiovascular disease in which a high-dose inactivated influenza vaccine did not significantly reduce all-cause mortality or cardiopulmonary hospitalizations in comparison with a standard dose vaccine25. To increase specificity we conducted a thorough clinical validation of included codes and included only respiratory and cardiovascular hospitalizations which were considered likely to be associated with influenza based on assessment of previous clinical studies3,5,8,9. We assumed rVE scenarios of 5–20% based on existing data and identified a number of scenarios where pragmatic RCTs would provide high statistical power with a sample size of <200,000 participants (Fig. 4)12,13,26,27. However, the influenza-attributable burden of broader secondary outcomes remains incompletely understood and will vary over time: endpoint selection involves a compromise between frequency and specificity which affects rVE, and these assumptions will require refinement as additional evidence arises including from ongoing RCTs17,28.This study was conducted in large databases capturing comprehensive healthcare outcomes with a long history of use for medical research, but databases are not perfect. VCRs are under-estimated because influenza vaccinations delivered at non-medical settings such as pharmacies or workplaces may not always be captured. Reassuringly, the VCR we captured from both Denmark and England are similar to those reported in routine national statistics29,30. Trends were consistent by country, though overall incidence rates were higher in Denmark, probably a result of differential healthcare investments or health systems specificities, healthcare seeking behavior or clinical thresholds for hospitalization31. These findings may not be generalizable to other healthcare settings or countries. Our study did not collect individual-level data so could not describe the effect modification of age on high-risk or vaccination status or intra-season correlations due to repeated observations of the same participants in multiple seasons. We included slightly different ICD-10 codes than some other researchers, differences which should be considered when interpreting the public health implications of a given rVE value8,32. Importantly, high-risk conditions in England were based on primary care consultations rather than the hospital contact data used in Denmark, likely explaining the higher prevalence of some conditions, notably asthma and kidney disorders, in England. Focusing on specificity, we captured only the primary/main reason for hospitalization and therefore may underestimate influenza: due to laboratory confirmation and coding practices, the full influenza burden in the US, for example, has been shown to be around 3-fold higher if codes relating to “any” rather than the primary diagnostic position are included33,34.In conclusion, we identified groups at high risk of respiratory and cardiovascular events who would represent ideal populations for inclusion in pragmatic influenza vaccine controlled trials. In addition to older individuals, younger adults with high-risk conditions experienced frequent hospitalizations; enrolling this population in rVE studies would increase the probability of detecting true differences between influenza vaccine types and platforms, allowing policymakers to make informed decisions on vaccine recommendations for this priority population group. Such studies appear feasible, particularly if enrollment was limited to individuals aged >50 yrs and/or with high-risk conditions. Pragmatic RCTs such as these would represent a research tool to understand the influenza-attributable proportion of respiratory and non-respiratory diseases and the full public health benefits of influenza vaccines in different population age and risk groups.MethodsStudy design and populationWe conducted a retrospective cohort study in the 2010/11–2017/18 influenza seasons from Denmark and the 2010/11–2018/19 seasons from England using large healthcare databases in each country. Populations aged ≥18 years on December 1st each year were included in seasonal cohorts and the number of hospitalized events occurring between December 1st and May 31st (defined as the influenza season) was divided by these denominators to calculate seasonal incidence rates of various outcomes stratified by age (18–34 years [yrs]; 35–49 yrs; 50–64 yrs; 65–74 yrs; ≥75 yrs), influenza vaccination status and the presence of clinical high risk (hereafter “high risk”) conditions. In both countries, influenza vaccination is recommended and provided free of charge for high-risk adults and adults aged ≥65 yrs35,36.Data sourcesAll Danish citizens are assigned a unique personal identification number which allows for exact linkage of nationwide administrative registers at the individual level. The Danish Civil Registration System, which records date of birth, emigration status and vital status for all persons residing in Denmark, was used to define cohorts37. The Danish National Patient Registry (DNPR) has shown high validity of cardiovascular diagnoses and captures all inpatient and outpatient hospital contacts coded in International Classification of Diseases 10 (ICD-10)22,38. The DNPR was used to count hospitalized events and to define high risk conditions. Influenza vaccination status was captured from the Danish National General Practitioners Reimbursement registry. Analyses were conducted by Danish researchers with access to raw, de-identified nationwide registry data in accordance with Danish law.The UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) is a longitudinal and representative primary care database from a network of over 1,800 primary care practices and includes 16 million currently registered active patients39,40,41,42. This analysis used data from the CPRD GOLD and CPRD Aurum primary care databases to define vaccination and high risk status, linked to secondary care data from Hospital Episode Statistics Admitted Patient Care database to capture hospitalized outcomes rates of specified events43. Influenza vaccinations administered in GP practices or community pharmacies are captured in these electronic health records. Analysis of the CPRD data was conducted internally by CPRD researchers using databases of pseudonymized patient EHRs, therefore individual participant consent is not required. The study protocol was approved by the Independent Scientific Advisory Committee (ISAC) at the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (protocol ref 20_115 R0 A1).Outcome selectionWe pre-specified groups of medical events, most of which were acute, based on previously documented and plausible associations with influenza, and which we considered outcomes of public health relevance for future pragmatic RCTs. ICD-10 coded primary discharge diagnoses (i.e., the main reason for hospitalization) resulting in hospitalization for ≥1 night were categorized into five groups: (1) influenza; (2) influenza and pneumonia; (3) respiratory; (4) cardiovascular; (5) exacerbations of diabetes. Groups were overlapping to explore the impact on incidence rate of including broader or more specific outcomes as potential study endpoints. The first occurrence of each event per season was included. The list of final codes within each category was selected from all “I” (cardiovascular), “J” (respiratory; of which J09-J11 were used to define ‘influenza’) and “E” (diabetic) ICD codes based on clinical review, available literature and discussion of the pathology and typical usage of those diagnostic codes in medical practice (Supplementary Table 1)9,44,45.Definition of high-risk conditionsClinical high-risk conditions corresponding to eligibility for free annual influenza vaccination were modified from definitions used by the UK National Health Service and Danish Statens Serum Institute. They included cardiovascular disorders (including arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, ischemic heart disease and congenital heart disease), respiratory conditions (including asthma), hepatic and renal disorders, neurologiceuromuscular disorders, blood disorders, metabolic/endocrine conditions including diabetes and conditions compromising the immune system35,36. For each condition, a list of ICD10 codes or prescription medication representing these diagnoses (for diabetes only) was defined (Supplementary Table 2). In the UK, primary care events coded with the SNOMED-CT architecture were mapped to these ICD-10 codes following review by a medical doctor (linked codes in Supplementary Data 1). Individuals diagnosed with qualifying events within the DNPR or CPRD primary care database within 3 years of the start of each influenza season, or a diabetes prescription <6 months before the start of each season, were included within that high-risk group for that season. Individuals receiving an influenza vaccination between August 1st and Jan 31st of the following year were considered vaccinated for that season.Statistical methodsThe total number of incident outcome events experienced by the study population was summed for each season. Incidence rates of included outcomes, expressed as rates per 100,000 population, were calculated per season for populations overall and stratified by age group, high-risk condition, and influenza vaccination status. Average seasonal incidence rates over included seasons and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using a Poisson model with the number of events as the dependent variable, no independent variables, and the log of the population size as an offset, with Stata’s ‘glm’ command. In this parameterization, the exponential of the intercept is the incidence rate. The variance was adjusted by a scale factor equal to the deviance divided by the residual degrees of freedom to accounting for under/overdispersion in the underlying data46,47. Incidence rate ratios (IRR) and their 95% CIs comparing rates in: a) vaccinated vs unvaccinated and b) individuals with high-risk conditions vs those with no high-risk conditions, were similarly estimated with a Poisson model. A range of identified incidence rates were used to estimate the power of an rVE study by exact method, specifically coded in SAS, based on binomial distribution of cases in investigational groups among overall number of cases, a type I error of 2.5%, 1:1 allocation ratio and a maximum of 200,000 participants (100k per group). We assumed rVE ranging from 5–20% and expressed the result as a series of heatmaps. Analyses were conducted separately within the Danish and UK databases; subsequent manipulations were performed using Stata v 15.1 and SAS.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.

While many bacterial infections can be treated with the same medications, antiviral treatments are often much more specific and, in many cases, there is not an agent that targets the pathogen responsible for the disease. Study: A natural broad-spectrum inhibitor of enveloped virus entry, effective against SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza A Virus in preclinical animal models. Image Credit: Inkoly / Shutterstock.com*Important notice: bioRxiv publishes preliminary scientific reports that are not peer-reviewed and, therefore, should not be regarded as conclusive, guide clinical practice/health-related behavior, or treated as established information. The lack of treatments that are directed against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has forced healthcare workers to treat infected patients with supplementary oxygen and invasive mechanical ventilation in the hopes that their immune system could eventually fight the infection. This has led researchers to recently investigate the potential of picolinic acid (PA) as an anti-SARS-CoV-2 treatment option. In vitro testing of PA In the current study published on the bioRxiv* preprint server, researchers initially theorized that as the endocytic process can be co-opted for viral cell entry, PA could interfere with SARS-CoV-2 infection, as it can interfere with endosome maturation. To this end, the in vitro antiviral efficacy of PA against the H1N1 influenza A virus (IAV) was initially tested at different doses in Madin-darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. A dose-dependent reduction in infectious virus counts was observed 48 hours post-infection with IAV, with the most inhibition reported at 2 micromolar (mM) PA. Further exploration with the ‘Swine Flu’ strain of IAV revealed consistent inhibition of viral replication, which led the scientists to further explore the ability of PA to inhibit other important human viral pathogens. Subsequently, PA was used to treat HEK293T-ACE2 cells, which exogenously express the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, following infection with SARS-CoV-2. To this end, PA was found to be effective, with a two-log reduction in viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) in the presence of 2 mM PA, which was a non-toxic dose for the cells. Further examination with different SARS-CoV-2 variants including the Alpha, Beta, and Delta variants showed consistent results. Furthermore, an investigation of flavivirus infection in A549 cells also showed significant viral inhibition. In vivo efficacy of PA Initial toxicity studies in BALB/c mice showed that PA was non-toxic at 20 mg/kg through both intraperitoneal (IP) and oral administration. At 100 mg/kg, PA was non-toxic orally; however, the IP administration of this dose resulted in an approximate 10% loss of body weight. Picolinic Acid mitigates SARS-CoV-2 replication and pathogenesis in vivo (A) Schematic for PA treatment in hamsters using prophylactic and therapeutic regimens is shown. Prophylactic treatment of hamsters involved administration of PA at 1,2 and 3 days prior to infection, followed by virus challenge at day 0. The therapeutic treatment used dosage during 1,2 and 3 dpi. In both cases, animals were sacrificed 4dpi. (B-D) Results for the administration of PA via IP route showing (B) lung vRNA copy number, total lung weight, and (D) bodyweight of animals up to 4 dpi. (E-G) Corresponding data for oral administration of PA showing (E) lung viral RNA copy number, (F) total lung weight, and (G) bodyweight of animals. qRT PCR and lung weight data shown are from 1 experiment (n=3 per group). Bodyweight data are from 1 experiment and presented as the mean percentage of bodyweight measured at Day 0, n= 2-5 per group. In all cases, One-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple comparisons was performed.*p < 0.05; **p < 0.01. (H) Histology images for all treatment groups including mock-infected and healthy controls. (I) Clinical scoring was based on the following criteria and labeled within inset images as (1) alveolar edema, (2) vascular and perivascular infiltration and (3) alveolar thickening and infiltration. Black arrows indicate vascular infiltration, arrowheads show perivascular infiltration, green arrow show alveolar edema. Scoring was done based on the severity on a scale of 1-4 (1-mild, 2-moderate, 3-severe, 4-very severe). An overall score was given by accumulating the total scores for each criterion.

These mice were either treated prophylactically or following infection with PA through both oral and IP routes. Almost every mouse that received PA treatment showed 100% survival rates, with the exception of the IP prophylactic group, which showed 80%. This was comparable to the control treatment group, which exhibited 20% survival rates. All PA treatments prevented significant weight loss, reduced infectious viral count in the lungs, and reduced pathological features of the disease. The same experiment was then performed against SARS-CoV-2 using the Syrian Golden hamster model. The IP administration of 20 mg/kg PA reduced lung viral RNA load on day three by about 3- and 1-fold for prophylactic and therapeutic treatment, respectively. Both treatment routes also significantly reduced lung inflammation and body weight loss. The anti-viral mechanism of PA Addition assays using SARS-CoV-2 and IAV were used as test viruses to identify the steps of inhibition during a single cycle of virus infection. To this end, pre-treatment of HEK cells with 2 mM PA for three hours before infection mitigated viral infection by 80%, with similar effects observed even after a one-hour incubation. However, if the PA was added at the time of infection, the effect was much more limited. A similar effect was observed when the experiment was conducted on Vero E6 cells. Further time-of-addition experiments, alongside membrane fusion investigations, revealed that PA acts against IAV by inhibiting the fusion of viral and endosomal membranes. Picolinic Acid inhibits IAV entry by interfering with Viral-Cellular endocytic membrane fusion and affecting viral membrane integrity. (A-C) A549 cells were either pre-treated for 3hr with 2mM PA, infected with 2 MOI PR8 WT in presence of the drug, and collected 3hr later (−3hr) or the virus was incubated with 2mM PA for 1hr and used for infection (1hr virus + PA). Microscopy data for A549 cells labeled with influenza virus nucleocapsid protein are shown in (A), quantification of NP positive cells is shown in (B), and (C) shows corresponding western blot data. (D-F) A549 cells were first infected with 2 MOI PR8 WT, PA treatment was done 6hr p.i (T0+6hr) and cells were collected a further 3hr later. Microscopy images with quantification and western blot analysis are shown in (D), (E), and (F). ***p < 0.001; ns - not significant using two-tailed unpaired t-test or one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple comparison test where applicable.

Despite comprising the largest fractions of circulating lymphocytes in the lung, rather little is known about how peripheral blood natural killer (NK) cell and T cell subsets are equipped for lung-homing in COVID-19 and influenza. Here, we provide a detailed comparative analysis of NK cells and T cells in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 or influenza virus, focusing on the protein and gene expression of chemokine receptors known to be involved in recruitment to the lung. For this, we used 28-colour flow cytometry as well as re-analysis of a publicly available single-cell RNA-seq dataset from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. Frequencies of NK cells and T cells expressing CXCR3, CXCR6, and CCR5 were altered in peripheral blood of COVID-19 and influenza patients, in line with increased transcript expression of CXCR3, CXCR6, and CCR5 and their respective ligands in BAL fluid. NK cells and T cells expressing lung-homing receptors displayed stronger phenotypic signs of activation compared to cells lacking lung-homing receptors, and activation was overall stronger in influenza compared to COVID-19. Together, our results indicate a role for CXCR3+, CXCR6+, and/or CCR5+ NK cells and T cells that potentially migrate to the lungs in moderate COVID-19 and influenza patients, identifying common targets for future therapeutic interventions in respiratory viral infections.IntroductionThe coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and recurrent epidemics caused by influenza virus highlight the need for a better understanding of respiratory viral infections which have the potential to cause major global epidemics or pandemics. Future disease outbreaks with novel variants of these viruses affecting the airways are to be expected and prepared for.Both SARS-CoV-2 and influenza share the same route of transmission and have highly overlapping symptoms and pathological features (1). During acute infection with respiratory viruses, the expression of specific chemokines mediating leukocyte recruitment are increased in the lung and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. These chemokines include CCL2, CCL3, CCL20, CXCL1, CXCL3, CXCL10, and IL8, attracting cells expressing chemokine receptors such as CCR2, CCR5, CXCR3, and CXCR6 (2–4). Patients suffering from severe COVID-19 exhibit exacerbated lung tissue damage likely resulting in a significant part from hyperactivated immune cells such as inflammatory macrophages (2), natural killer (NK) cells (5) and T cells (2, 6). Since lung-homing cytotoxic lymphocytes can contribute to lung pathology during acute infection, a better understanding of their major homing mechanisms will help in developing and improving treatment strategies in COVID-19, influenza, and presumably also other respiratory viral infections.In this study, we investigated expression of lung-homing receptors and in vivo activation of NK cell and T cell subsets in the peripheral blood of patients suffering from moderate COVID-19 or influenza, and in healthy controls. The majority of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 or influenza virus will experience mild or moderate disease. While moderate disease in COVID-19 and in influenza patients is per definition not fatal, patients may still require hospitalization and/or experience persistent long-term symptoms such as fatigue, respiratory problems, loss of taste or smell, headache, and diarrhea. An improved understanding of disease progression and the involvement of the immune system also in patients with moderate respiratory disease are important for better understanding the disease mechanisms and long-term development of therapeutic approaches. This study focuses on NK cells and T cells which belong to the first-line response to viral infections e.g. by cytotoxicity against infected cells and recruiting other cells to the site of infection. In addition to analyses by 28-colour flow cytometry, we analyzed gene expression in NK cells and T cells using a publicly available single-cell (sc)RNA-seq dataset of cells from bronchoalveolar lavage (7). Our data indicate a universal role for CXCR3-mediated lung-homing of NK cells and T cells in COVID-19 and influenza and an additional role for recruitment via CXCR6 and CCR5 in CD8+ T cells.Together, we provide an extensive characterization of the lung-homing potential of NK cells and T cells in homeostasis and during acute respiratory viral infections with an emphasis on COVID-19 and influenza. The present results are of relevance for the understanding of the disease progression and for identifying target molecules to improve future therapeutic treatment strategies.Material and MethodsPatients and Processing of Peripheral BloodWe enrolled a total of 10 hospitalized patients (four females and six males; age range 24-70; average age 55.3) who were diagnosed with COVID-19 by RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory samples. COVID-19 patients were sampled on average 11 days (range 6-16) after symptom onset. All of the COVID-19 patients were considered ‘moderate’ based on the guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 (Version 7) released by the National Health Commission and State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine (8). Furthermore, we enrolled 18 patients who tested positive for IAV (n=12) or IBV (n=6) (nine females and nine males; age range 21-84; median age 45) by RT-qPCR who were recruited during the four months immediately preceding the outbreak of COVID-19 in the Stockholm region. Influenza patients were sampled on average 4 days (range 1-11) after symptom onset. Nine of the 18 influenza patients were hospitalized.None of the COVID-19 patients and only one of the influenza patients received immunosuppressive treatment. Diagnostics for all patients were performed at the diagnostic laboratory at the Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. Mononuclear cells from peripheral blood were isolated by density gradient centrifugation (Lymphoprep). For each of the two separate cohorts, blood was collected from healthy blood donors and processed in parallel with patient samples. A detailed overview of the patient characteristics from all datasets used in this study is provided in Table 1.TABLE 1 Table 1 Clinical summary and demographics for patient cohorts included in study.The study was approved by the Regional Ethical Review Board in Stockholm, Sweden, and by the Swedish Ethical Review Authority. All donors provided informed written consent prior to blood sampling.Transcriptome AnalysisPreprocessed and annotated scRNA-seq datasets of cells from BAL fluid from healthy controls and COVID-19 patients were obtained in RDS formats from published data (7). The data was read and analyzed using Seurat (4.0.5). Quality filtering and cell and cluster annotations were retained from the original analysis. The counts were scaled and transformed using the SCTransform function with mitochondrial gene expression regressed out before dimension reduction and clustering. For further visualization and analysis, the RNA counts were log normalized and scaled with mitochondrial reads regressed out, using the Seurat-implemented functions NormalizeData and ScaleData. Existing NK cells and T cell identities were confirmed by clustering and expression of canonical markers. CD4+ T cell, CD8+ T cell, and NK cell subsets were extracted and scaled before analysis of chemokine receptor and effector molecule expression based on patient groups. The code used for the scRNA-seq analysis can be found at https://github.com/Ingarod/BAL_Cov.Flow CytometryAntibodies and clones used for phenotyping are listed in Supplementary Table 1. Secondary staining was performed with streptavidin BB630 (BD Biosciences) and Live/Dead Aqua (Invitrogen). After surface staining, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were fixed and permeabilized using FoxP3/Transcription Factor staining kit (eBioscience).Samples were analyzed on a BD LSR Symphony equipped with five lasers (355nm, 405nm, 488nm, 563nm, and 633nm) (BD Biosciences), and data were analyzed using FlowJo version 9.5.2 and version 10.7.1 (Tree Star Inc.).Statistical AnalysesGraphPad Prism 8 and 9 (GraphPad Software) was used for statistical analyses. The statistical method used is indicated in each figure legend.ResultsAltered Frequencies of NK Cell and T Cell Subsets Expressing Chemokine Receptors in Peripheral Blood in COVID-19 and Influenza PatientsTo analyze lung-homing capacities of NK cells and T cells during acute respiratory viral infections, we first determined the expression of chemokine receptors relevant for lung-homing (CXCR3, CXCR6, CCR2, CCR5) on NK and T cell subsets in peripheral blood from COVID-19 and influenza patients as well as healthy controls (Figure 1; see Figure S1A for gating strategy).FIGURE 1 Figure 1 Altered composition of NK cells and T cells expressing different lung-homing receptors in peripheral blood in acute viral infection. (A) Schematic overview of study design. In brief, blood was collected from healthy controls, and from patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 or influenza A virus (IAV) or influenza B virus (IBV). Additionally, a publicly available RNA-seq dataset from BAL-fluid from COVID-19-infected patients published by Liao et al. (7) was re-analyzed.

(D-G) Wilcoxon matched-rank test. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ****p < 0.0001.In peripheral blood, both NK cells and T cells displayed an altered lung-homing receptor expression during acute infection with SARS-CoV-2 or influenza (Figures 1B, C). With respect to NK cells, all analyzed chemokine receptors were generally more frequently expressed on CD56brightCD16– NK cells as compared to CD56dimCD16+ NK cells in both COVID-19 (Figure 1D) as well as influenza (Figure 1D). When compared to healthy controls, a trend towards a loss of CXCR3+ in COVID-19 and loss of CXCR3+ and CXCR6+ NK cells in influenza patients was observed (Figures 1C, E). In influenza patients, CCR5 expression was slightly increased on NK cells as compared to healthy controls (Figure 1E). In addition to the chemokine receptors predominantly expressed on CD56brightCD16– NK cells, we found high expression of CXCR2 on peripheral blood CD56dimCD16+ NK cells both in healthy controls and COVID-19 patients (Figures S2A, B). The expression of CXCR2 was higher on CD56dimCD16+ NK cells lacking other lung-homing receptors (Figure S2). The frequency of CD56dimCD16+ NK cells expressing solely CXCR2 was significantly reduced in COVID-19 patients (Figure S2D).Overall, T cells displayed similar expression patterns as NK cells in terms of lower frequencies of CXCR3+ CD8+ T cells in COVID-19 patients and of CXCR3+ and CXCR6+ CD8+ T cells in influenza patients (Figures 1E, F). Furthermore, there was a trend towards lower frequencies of CCR2+ T cells in COVID-19 and in influenza (Figures 1F, G). Except for CXCR3, chemokine receptor expression was generally higher on non-naïve T cell subsets, both in healthy controls and COVID-19 patients (Figure S2G, H; gating strategy in Figure S1A). CXCR3 was also highly expressed on naïve CD8+ T cells (Figure S2H) as reported before (9). CXCR2 was expressed mainly on CD8+ T cells, yet no differences between healthy and COVID-19 patients were observed (Figure S2E, F). For all chemokine receptors except CXCR2 a lower expression was observed on non-naïve T cells in COVID-19 patients (Figure S2G, H).Loss of CXCR3 was observed in all non-naïve T cells in COVID-19 patients (Figure S2G, H), being significant in non-naïve CD8+ T cells as compared to healthy controls (Figure S2H). When comparing subsets of CD8+ memory T cells (TCM, TEM, TEMRA), patterns of lung-homing receptors differed between the subsets, with CXCR3 being highly expressed on all memory subsets and highest on CD4+ TEMRA (Figure S2I) and CD8+ TCM cells (Figure S2J). Loss of CXCR3 in COVID-19 patients was observed in all memory T cell subsets (Figure S2I, J). In contrast, CXCR6, CCR2, and CCR5 were most highly expressed on TEM cells both in healthy controls and COVID-19 patients (Figure S2I, J). Non-significant trends of reduction in CXCR6, CCR2, and CCR5 expression were observed in all memory T cell subsets (Figure S2I, J).Together, the results indicate that the major subsets affected during moderate infection with COVID-19 or influenza are lymphocytes expressing CXCR3 as well as CXCR6 and CCR5. Direct comparative analyses in COVID-19 and influenza patients suggest common lung-homing capacities but also potential differences between NK cell- and T cell-lung homing in the two diseases.Common Activation Profiles in Peripheral Blood NK Cells Expressing Lung-Homing Receptors in COVID-19 and Influenza PatientsWe and others have previously demonstrated an activated phenotype in peripheral blood NK cells and T cells in COVID-19 and influenza, respectively (5, 10, 11). Here, we aimed to determine the expression of NK and T cell activation markers in relation to expression of lung-homing receptors. For this purpose, we identified chemokine receptor-positive cells in COVID-19 and influenza patients by boolean gating, combining cells expressing CXCR3, CXCR6, CCR2, and/or CCR5 (Figures 2, 3, See gating strategy in Figure S1B, C). In COVID-19 patients, NK cells expressing these lung-homing receptors displayed higher expression of CD69 (on CD56brightCD16– and CD56dimCD16+ NK cells) and Ki67 (in CD56dimCD16+), as compared to lung-homing receptor-negative NK cells (Figures 2A–C). Expression of CD38 was overall high but slightly lower on lung-homing receptor-positive NK cells (Figure 2B). Due to very low numbers of CD56brightCD16– NK cells lacking any relevant chemokine receptor in healthy controls, no comparisons could be performed for chemokine receptor-negative CD56brightCD16- NK cells.FIGURE 2 Figure 2 Lung-homing receptor-positive NK cells display an activated phenotype in peripheral blood of COVID-19 and influenza patients. Chemokine receptor-positive cells in COVID-19 and influenza patients were identified using the Boolean gate “CXCR3+ OR CXCR6+ OR CCR2+ OR CCR5+” (‘CR+’; see representative gates in Figure S1B). Cells lacking all of these receptors were identified as chemokine receptor-negative (CR–).

The frequency of CD38+ NK cells was similar in COVID-19 and influenza patients (Figures 2C, F). These data indicate general differences in activation patterns for NK cells in COVID-19 and influenza patients. Expression of effector molecules (granzymes, perforin) was increased in NK cells in both COVID-19 (Figure 2G–I and Figure S3A, C, D) and influenza patients (Figures 2J–L and Figure S3B, E, F), both in frequency of positive NK cells and in expression levels. Significant increases in expression levels of granzyme A, granzyme B, and perforin were particularly observed in CD56brightCD16- NK cells (Figure S3D, F). In healthy controls as well as COVID-19 and influenza patients, overall effector molecule expression was highest in lung-homing receptor-negative NK cells (Figures 2G, H, J, K). However, the expression of granzymes and perforin was strongest in CD56brightCD16- NK cells expressing lung-homing receptors (Figures 2H, I, K, L). Relative to healthy controls, influenza patients had higher perforin upregulation than COVID-19 patients (Figures 2I, L), indicating stronger activation of peripheral blood NK cells in influenza.Together, these results demonstrate common activation patterns between NK cell subsets in COVID-19 and influenza patients, with a stronger activation of NK cells expressing CXCR3, CXCR6, CCR2, and/or CCR5 than NK cells lacking any lung-homing receptors. Furthermore, blood NK cells in influenza patients generally displayed stronger signs of activation compared to COVID-19 patients with moderate disease.Different Activation Patterns Between COVID-19 and Influenza in NK Cells and T CellsSince both NK cells and T cells displayed a loss of lung-homing receptor-positive cells in COVID-19 and influenza patients (Figure 1), we next sought to determine whether activation patterns differed between lung-homing receptor-positive and -negative T cells (Figure 3). In COVID-19 patients CD69 expression was biased towards CD8+ T cells co-expressing lung-homing receptors (Figures 3A–C). In contrast, CD69 upregulation was overall higher and more uniform between the T cell subsets in influenza (Figures 3D–F). Furthermore, CD38 was strongly upregulated on CD8+ T cells in influenza but not COVID-19 patients (Figures 3B–F). Finally, expression of Ki67 was largely confined to chemokine receptor-positive T cells, both in healthy controls and in COVID-19 patients (Figures 3B, C). Upregulation of Ki67 was strongest in lung-homing receptor-positive CD8+ T cells (Figure 3C), which is in line with patterns observed in CD56dimCD16+ chemokine receptor-positive NK cells (Figure 2C), indicating a particular activation of cytotoxic lymphocytes expressing lung-homing receptors in COVID-19 patients.In comparison to NK cells where upregulation of effector molecules was more uniform between COVID-19 and influenza patients (Figure 2), differences were more distinct for T cells (Figures 3G–L). As expected, expression of perforin and granzymes was to a large extent contained to cytotoxic CD8+ T cells (Figures 3G, H, J, K), although some expression was also observed in lung-homing receptor-positive CD4+ T cells in COVID-19 and influenza patients (Figures 3G, H, J, K). Expression of granzyme B and perforin was highest in lung-homing receptor-negative CD8+ T cells in healthy controls as well as in COVID-19 and influenza patients (Figures 3H, K). Importantly however, a significant increase in effector molecule expression was mainly found in the lung-homing receptor-positive CD8+ T cell subset (Figures 3K, L).Stratification of co-expression of lung-homing receptors and specific effector molecules showed some variation but also similarities between all cytotoxic cell subsets (CD56brightCD16-/CD56dimCD16+ NK cells and CD8+ T cells) and between COVID-19 and influenza (Figure 3M). In detail, the frequency of GzmA+GzmB+perforin+ cells co-expressing lung-homing receptors was commonly strongly increased in patients, except for CD56dimCD16+ NK cells in COVID-19 patients. This increase in cells co-expressing multiple effector molecules was accompanied with a specific reduction of GzmA+GzmB-perforin- lung-homing receptor-positive cells. Despite this increase in effector molecule expression and while almost all NK cells expressed effector molecules, the frequency of CD8+ T cells lacking both effector molecules and lung-homing receptors increased in COVID-19 patients. No or only minor changes were seen for GzmA-single-positive NK cells and T cells lacking lung-homing receptors (Figure 3M).Finally, direct comparison of effector molecule expression levels between NK cells and T cells as well as between COVID-19 and influenza patients revealed similarities but also slightly different patterns between the two diseases: Granzyme A and B were significantly increased in CD56brightCD16- NK cells and CD4+ T cells in COVID-19 patients (Figure S3D), while granzyme B and perforin levels were significantly higher in NK cells and T cells in influenza patients (Figure S3F).Together, these data indicate an overall stronger in vivo priming of T and NK cells co-expressing lung-homing receptors as compared to their counterpart lacking lung-homing receptors. Furthermore, upregulation of activation markers on T cells and NK cells was stronger in influenza patients as compared to COVID-19 patients. Hence, lymphocytes with a capacity of cytotoxic function display a broader pattern of activation in influenza patients as compared to COVID-19 patients with moderate disease.Accumulation of Phenotypically Armed NK Cells and T Cells Expressing Lung-Homing Receptors in BAL Fluid of COVID-19 PatientsThe loss of NK cells and T cells expressing lung-homing receptors in the peripheral blood of COVID-19 and influenza patients suggests migration of the respective cells to the infected lung tissue. This would lead to an accumulation of NK cells and T cells in the lung with different characteristics as compared to healthy controls.In order to analyze changes in NK cells and T cells in the lung upon respiratory viral infection, we analyzed gene expression of chemokines that are ligands to CXCR3, CXCR6, CCR2, and CCR5 (Figure 4A) or total chemokines (Figure S4A) in total BAL cells as well as chemokine receptors in NK cells and CD8+ T cells (Figure 4B and Figure S4B) using a publicly available scRNAseq dataset from BAL fluid cells from COVID-19 patients with moderate or severe disease (7). High transcript levels of a large number of chemokines were found in patients with severe disease (Figure 4A and Figure S4A). In comparison, in patients with moderate disease, increases in transcript levels were limited to CXCL9/CXCL10/CXCL11, CXCL16, and CCL5, which are encoding ligands for CXCR3, CXCR6, and CCR5, respectively. In line with these results, transcripts for CXCR3, CXCR6, and CCR5 were highly enriched in NK cells as well as CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in COVID-19 patients with moderate disease, suggesting a highly specific accumulation of cells expressing the respective receptors in the lung (Figure 4B). In patients with severe disease, gene expression of chemokine receptors was low as compared to patients with moderate disease and even healthy controls (Figure 4B). High expression of FCGR3A, encoding CD16 indicated a high frequency of CD56dimCD16+ NK cells in BAL fluid in patients with severe disease (Figure 4B). CD56dimCD16+ NK cells largely lack expression of the chemokine receptors analyzed in this study, explaining the corresponding low gene expression of chemokine receptors in these patients. Although it is possible that some of the cells in BAL fluid of patients with moderate disease are comprised of tissue-resident NK cells and memory T cells which express high levels of CXCR3 and CXCR6 at the transcriptional and protein levels (12, 13), our data strongly suggest specific infiltration of NK cells and T cells from peripheral blood into the lung in COVID-19 patients with moderate disease. Other chemokines potentially important for NK and T cell recruitment in patients with moderate disease are CCL18 and HMGB1, due to their increased expression in BAL fluid of these donors (Figure S4A). While the putative cognate receptor for CCL18, CCR8, is not expressed on BAL NK cells and T cells (Figure S4B), CXCR4, the cognate receptor for CXCL12 is highly expressed on BAL NK cells and CD4+ T cells (Figure S4B). CXCL12 is forming a complex with HMGB1 which enables signaling through CXCR4 (14). CXCR4 expression was overall low in BAL NK and T cells from patients with moderate disease but high in patients with severe disease (Figure S4B). Hence, further investigations are needed for understanding CXCR4-mediated lymphocyte recruitment to the lung in respiratory viral infections.FIGURE 4 Figure 4 Gene expression of chemokines, chemokine receptors, and effector molecules in NK cells and T cells in BAL fluid in patients with moderate and severe COVID-19. (A) Dot plots of average chemokine RNA expression in total BAL fluid cells. (B) Average gene expression and proportion of FCGR3A and chemokine receptors in NK cells as well as chemokine receptors in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from BAL fluid from healthy controls (n = 3) and COVID-19 patients with moderate (n = 3) or severe (n = 6) disease. (C) Violin plots of RNA expression of effector molecules in BAL fluid NK cells and in CD8+ T cells in healthy controls and moderate and severe COVID-19 patients. (A–C) The respective scRNA-seq dataset is derived from Liao et al. (7).Since NK cells and CD8+ T cells from peripheral blood displayed upregulated levels of effector molecules, these cells might have important cytotoxic implications upon infiltration into the lung. Indeed, NK cells and CD8+ T cells in BAL fluid from COVID-19 patients displayed increased transcript expression levels of GZMA, GZMB, and PRF1 even in patients with moderate disease (Figure 4C).Altogether, our data suggest distinct recruitment of activated CXCR3+ and CXCR6+ NK cells and T cells to the lung in patients with moderate COVID-19 and influenza, indicating overlapping recruitment mechanisms in these two respiratory viral infections despite minor differences in effector molecule expression. A better understanding of lung-homing of innate and adaptive cytotoxic lymphocytes in patients with respiratory viral infections might reveal universal concepts of disease progression in these two, and possibly other, respiratory viral infections.DiscussionThe COVID-19 pandemic has raised awareness about the need for a better understanding of the course of respiratory viral infections. So far, only a few studies have compared cellular immune responses in COVID-19 and other respiratory viral infections side by side (15–17). Both SARS-CoV-2 and influenza cause respiratory disease with similar disease presentation ranging from asymptomatic or mild to severe disease and death. Despite parallels between COVID-19 and influenza, both diseases differ at an immunological level, for example, SARS-CoV-2 does not infect NK cells, T cells, or other mononuclear blood cells due to the lack of ACE2 (18), while influenza virus has been suggested to infect NK cells (19). Furthermore, NK cells can directly recognize the viral protein Hemagglutinin (HA) of influenza virus by NKp46 (20), while SARS-CoV-2 S protein has been suggested to bind to NKG2D (21), suggesting differences in virus-dependent mechanisms of NK cell activation. In contrast to influenza virus, SARS-CoV-2 can spread to other organs if not cleared efficiently from the respiratory tract (22), and the viruses induce different antiviral responses in lung epithelial cells (23). Therefore, patterns of leukocyte activation and trafficking in respiratory viral infections are of interest for identifying and targeting common molecular pathways for therapeutic interventions (24). While a broad perturbation of the immune system and a distinct recruitment of myeloid cells to the lung has been shown for patients with severe COVID-19 (25), the regulation of lymphocyte recruitment to the lung has been investigated less, in particular in patients with moderate disease.Here, we compared changes in NK cell and T cell subset compositions, focusing on expression of the lung-homing receptors CXCR3, CXCR6, CCR2, and CCR5, in the peripheral blood from patients with clinically moderate COVID-19 or influenza. Peripheral blood NK cells and T cells, in particular CD8+ T cells, largely overlapped in their lung-homing receptor expression profile in COVID-19 and influenza patients. This indicates similar lung-homing mechanisms for cytotoxic lymphocytes in both diseases. We identified a stronger loss of CXCR3+ and CXCR6+ CD8+ T cells and overall stronger activation of NK cells and T cells in the blood of influenza patients as compared to COVID-19 patients, in line with the recent observation of a lower inflammatory profile in COVID-19 patients as compared to influenza patients (15). The activated profile of NK cells and CD8+ T cells, including elevated expression of CD69 and Ki67, and induction of perforin, is biased towards subsets co-expressing lung-homing receptors. Levels of corresponding leukocyte-recruiting chemokines such as CXCL10, CCL5, and CXCL5 are elevated in the BAL fluid and in nasopharyngeal swabs of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (26–28), supporting our hypothesis of the importance of these chemokines for recruitment of lymphocytes expressing CXCR3, CCR5, and potentially also CXCR2. Monocytes producing ligands for CXCR3 have been shown to be expanded in the lungs of COVID-19 patients (7), and although not significant, CXCL10 mRNA expression was increased in monocytic macrophages from BAL fluid from COVID-19 patients with moderate disease (2). This may contribute to elevated lung infiltration of CXCR3+ lymphocytes in COVID-19 patients. In contrast, data on chemokine expression in the lung of influenza-virus infected patients are rather limited. CXCL10 (IP-10) is strongly increased in BAL fluid (29) and lung tissue (3) of severe or fatal cases, respectively, but not increased in BAL fluid of patients with moderate disease (29). Interestingly, cytokine and chemokine production were higher in severe influenza as compared to severe COVID-19 (29), but more data on the direct comparison between COVID-19 and influenza patients at moderate level are needed. In serum, CXCL10 has been shown to be upregulated in influenza patients (30, 31) and in SARS patients patients with ARDS (32). Changes in chemokine levels in peripheral blood of COVID-19 and influenza patients have been addressed by multiple studies, in particular CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11, CXCL16, CCL2, and CCL5 were altered in patients as compared to controls, and levels correlated to disease severity (23, 27, 33–36). Finally, CXCR3+ cells are overall increased in the lung of Rhesus macaques following infection with SARS-CoV-2 (37), and CXCL10 levels were increased in in vitro influenza virus-infected human macrophages (38), in human lung tissue explants infected with SARS-CoV-2 (26), and in the lungs of mice infected with influenza virus (4, 39, 40).Together, this suggests a predominant role for the CXCR3:CXCL10 axis for lung-homing upon respiratory viral infection and also in non-viral lung tissue injury (41). Elevated CXCL10 levels in BAL were associated with longer duration of mechanical ventilation in COVID-19 patients (27). In mice, CXCR3-deficiency rescued CCR5-deficient mice from IAV-induced mortality (42). Other murine IAV infection models demonstrated a role for CXCR3 and CCR5 for NK cell lung-homing and showed NK cell accumulation in the lung was not due to proliferation or apoptosis (40). For CD8+ T cells, murine models demonstrated that virus-specific T cells express CXCR3 and migrate to CXCR3 ligands in vitro (43). Furthermore, CCR5 is required for recruitment of memory CD8+ T cells to IAV-infected epithelium and is rapidly upregulated on the surface of memory CD8+ T cells upon viral challenge (43). Interestingly, these mouse models also revealed that CCR5 is required for circulating CD8+ memory T cells to migrate to respiratory airways but not lung parenchyma during virus challenge (43), indicating potential distinct migration patterns depending on chemokine receptor expression. In addition to CCR5 and CXCR3, CXCR6 has been suggested to be of importance for recruitment of resident memory T cells to the airways both in mice (13) and in patients with moderate COVID-19 (7). Indeed, our analysis of RNA-seq data from BAL fluid of COVID-19 patients suggest a CXCR3- and CXCR6-mediated recruitment of NK cells and T cells, as well as a CCR5-mediated recruitment particularly of CD8+ T cells in moderate disease. In severe disease, myeloid cells which likely derive from circulation, comprise the major subset infiltrating the lung (25). In these patients, hyperinflammation will lead to lung tissue damage, accompanied with vascular permeability, pulmonary capillary leakage (44, 45) and oedema with an increased extravascular lung water index (46). Hence, infiltration of NK cells and T cells might be rather unspecific during severe disease due to capillary leakage. This is supported by a high expression of FCGR3A, encoding CD16, in the BAL fluid NK cells of patients with severe COVID-19 as it indicates a high frequency of CD56dimCD16+ NK cells. These cells constitute the majority of NK cells in the circulation and largely lack expression of the chemokine receptors analyzed in this study, explaining the overall low chemokine receptor gene expression in patients with severe COVID-19. In patients with severe COVID-19, CXCR4 might play a crucial role in recruitment of NK cells and T cells as indicated by our and previous analysis of the BAL fluid dataset (47), but further studies are needed to unravel CXCR4-mediated lung-infiltration.The relevance of the CXCR3:CXCL10 axis for lung tissue-homing of cytotoxic immune cells such as NK cells and CD8+ T cells might be of interest for future approaches of intervention. In critical patients with severe COVID-19, pharmacologic inhibition of e.g. the CCR1 and/or CCR5 (2, 48) or the CXCL10:CXCR3 and the CXCL16:CXCR6 pathways (49, 50), respectively, were suggested to suppress hyperinflammation. Despite not being life-threatening, moderate respiratory infection can require hospitalization, can progress into severe disease, and/or can result in long-term consequences such as ‘long COVID’. Given that hyperactivated cytotoxic lymphocytes including NK cells and CD8+ T cells might play an important role in tissue injury, a targeted therapeutic approach appears desirable also in patients with moderate respiratory disease. Based on our results, we support focusing on CXCL10:CXCR3 and CXCL16:CXCR6 also in moderate disease as an early intervention for mitigating short- and long-term complications in these patients. This approach might be globally relevant for respiratory viral infections since e.g. antibody-mediated targeting of CXCL10 also improved survival of H1N1-infected mice (51). Furthermore, the role of circulating NK cells and T cells in COVID-19 and in influenza in potentially facilitating the recruitment of other cell types such as neutrophils (24) or other T cells (47) needs to be considered, and the potential immunoregulatory roles of NK cells and T cells in the human lung as well as other organs in health and viral disease remains to be studied further (52).While our study benefits from access to cells from peripheral blood as well as to a RNA-seq dataset from BAL fluid of COVID-19 patients with moderate disease, a shortcoming of our study is a low number of patients, impeding a detailed stratification by clinical or other parameters, such as age, gender, and comorbidities. Another limitation is the indirect comparison of BAL fluid to protein analyses since the cohorts were not identical, and BAL fluid was not available from our cohort. Analysis of chemokines at the local site of infection in correlation to the chemokine receptor expression of lymphocytes in blood and lung would be highly relevant for this study. However, we believe that the publicly available RNA-seq data offers great value in complementing our study. Furthermore, when directly comparing COVID-19 and influenza, the differences in time-course and pathophysiology of the two viral diseases need to be considered. A longer interval between infection and onset of symptoms in COVID-19 patients as compared to the rapid onset of disease in influenza patients might result in differences in NK cell and T cell activation and phenotypic patterns, and large multicenter studies are required to validate our and other groups’ findings before they can be applied in a clinical setting. Finally, future studies will assess how acute respiratory viral infection with SARS-CoV-2, influenza viruses, and other viruses affects the landscape of activated NK cells and T cells in the lung.Together, our results strongly implicate the importance of, in particular, CXCR3 as a lung-homing receptor in respiratory viral infections such as SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus in humans. The results also reveal a role for other receptors such as CXCR6 and CCR5 on CD56brightCD16– NK cells and CD8+ T cells as potential alternative receptors of importance. A better understanding of how these chemokine receptors affect disease progression might help to develop future immunotherapeutic interventions in patients that developed disease in current or future epidemics or pandemics with respiratory viral infections.Data Availability StatementThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation.Ethics StatementThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by the Regional Ethical Review Board in Stockholm, Sweden, Swedish Ethical Review Authority, Stockholm, Sweden.

The Suffolk County site was quarantined, and properties with outbreaks are set to be depopulated in order to mitigate the risk of the virus’s spreading to other flocks. Test samples from the flock were processed at the Cornell University Animal Health Diagnostic Center and confirmed at the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service laboratories in Iowa.According to the USDA, this case comes after a string of HPAI outbreaks have been reported across the U.S., in both commercial and backyard flocks. Cases include a flock of commercial chickens in Kentucky, commercial turkey farms in Indiana, and a backyard flock of mixed-species birds in Virginia. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, HPAI infects the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts of birds. The virus can rapidly spread through flocks of poultry, causing high mortality. Signs of the virus in poultry can include a lack of energy, reduced appetite, purple discoloration or swelling of various body parts, diarrhea, nasal discharge, decreased egg production, or sudden death.Naturally, you may have heard about avian flu outbreaks in the past and now are wondering: Do we have another pandemic like COVID-19 on our hands? Thankfully, that outcome seems unlikely with this bird flu at this stage. According to the CDC, no human cases of this specific subtype of bird flu viruses have been recorded in the U.S., though human bird flu cases have happened with other avian influenza subtypes in the past. In the U.S., as well as in other countries, past outbreaks of bird flu have been linked with illness and death in people. This can happen in rare instances because infected birds shed the virus in their saliva, mucous, and feces, and people may then touch or inhale those viral particles. This can lead to symptoms including conjunctivitis, fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches, nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, shortness of breath, and more, according to the CDC. Again, though, these instances are uncommon. While the Suffolk County, New York, outbreak was a noncommercial operation, USDA officials have reached out to larger poultry and egg farms in nearby Connecticut to ensure they are implementing safe practices. “Now is the time for all poultry owners in Connecticut to take this risk seriously,” said Connecticut Commissioner of Agriculture Bryan P. Hurlburt in a statement. “Connecticut has a thriving commercial poultry industry and thousands of hobbyists who keep chickens, ducks, and other poultry. It is important that we do all we can to protect our birds.” Whether poultry owners are running a small-scale, backyard operation or a large commercial enterprise, they have been advised to review their biosecurity practices—such as sanitizing equipment and restricting the flow of visitors and equipment from other sites—to best ensure their birds are in good health. Connecticut bird owners can report poultry health concerns to the State Veterinarian by phoning 860-713-2505 or emailing CTState.Vet@CT.gov. The USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service can also be reached at 866-536-7593.Related:How We Can Actually Increase Food Access Nationwide8 Small Ways to Actually Cut Down on Your Food WasteHow to Wash Fruit and Vegetables So They’re as Clean as PossibleSerena Coady is a writer.

Solis/AP, FILEWith more scientists predicting COVID-19 boosters will be needed each year, some are now working on combining those with the annual flu vaccine. The idea, experts say, is a single injection given each fall that protects against seasonal flu and COVID-19.Pharmaceutical companies Moderna and Novavax have already announced plans to work on a combo shot, but don't expect them to be available this upcoming flu season. Instead, Moderna's CEO saying a combo shot could be ready by 2023.Although studies indicate​ COVID-19 vaccine efficacy fades over time, experts say it's not a foregone conclusion that every American will need an annual COVID-19 booster. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, said this week that as of right now, most Americans don't need a fourth dose (beyond the existing booster shot), but scientists are constantly evaluating the situation.“I think we first have to assess the long-term need for annual COVID vaccines,” says Dr. Anna Durbin, director of Center for Immunization Research at Johns Hopkins University.However, "if there is a continued need for COVID vaccines, then combining that with influenza would make sense," Durbin said.There are a few technical challenges to creating a combination vaccine. One is that different scientific approaches have been used for the two types of vaccines.A man pulls a pallet with the "Nuvaxovid" vaccine against the novel coronavirus / COVID-19 by US company Novavax after a shipment of the vaccine arrived, Feb. 24, 2022, at a warehouse in Hagenbrunn, Lower Austria.Florian Weiser/APA/AFP via Getty ImagesMORE: What you need to know about COVID-19 boosters and how long they take to work“Right now, the influenza vaccine is a different platform," said Durbin. The most widely used flu vaccines in the US contain ‘inactivated’ (killed) or attenuated (weakened) virus to trigger an immune response in the body. This differs from mRNA (or messenger RNA) vaccines which teach the body's cells how to make proteins that trigger immune responses. The result is that they currently have to be given in separate shots.While two of the three authorized COVID vaccines are based on mRNA technology, previous influenza vaccines have not utilized this technology. But now, Moderna and Pfizer are working on an mRNA flu vaccine.In addition to differences in technology, an extra challenge is that the most common influenza vaccine in the U.S. is quadrivalent, meaning it is designed to protect against four different flu viruses.“This means the combined influenza/COVID vaccine would also likely need to be quadrivalent or at least trivalent. That makes the vaccine more complicated," says Durbin.Similarly, the rise of new COVID variants may introduce challenges to vaccine development.MORE: Should you get a booster shot? Experts say it's timeThis past September, Novavax enrolled people in a Phase 1/2 study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and immune response of a combination vaccine using Novavax' seasonal influenza and COVID-19 vaccines. Unlike Pfizer and Moderna's vaccines which use mRNA, these vaccines use protein subunit technology, which introduces a fragment of the virus into the body that is recognized by the immune system and triggers a response. These have each previously demonstrated strong results as standalone vaccines in Phase 3 clinical trials.Moderna has also announced that it is developing a single dose vaccine that combines a booster against COVID-19 and a booster against flu, called mRNA-1073. In preclinical studies, Moderna has observed that its seasonal flu and COVID-19 booster vaccines can be combined into one dose that produces an immune response to ​both viruses.Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel predicted this combo shot could be available in 2023 -- not in time for this upcoming flu season, but potentially the following year."I think it makes a lot of sense to try to develop these vaccines, but it may take a bit of time," Durbin said.Aiya Aboubakr is an internal medicine resident at New York Presbyterian-Weill Cornell Medical Center, and a contributor to the ABC News Medical Unit.Popular ReadsCalifornia fire grows over 20,000 acresNov 7, 9:47 PMSeattle stabbings: 10 attacked in 2 daysNov 8, 7:04 PMFEMA probing supervisor over Trump sign orderNov 9, 3:46 PMWhat Trump's win reveals about American votersNov 9, 5:09 AM538's final forecasts for the 2024 electionNov 5, 7:49 AMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkAbout Nielsen MeasurementChildren's Online Privacy PolicyContact UsDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationInterest-Based AdsPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseYour US State Privacy Rights © 2024 ABC NewsNine Cases of Lethal Bird Flu in Eastern U.S. ​ Skip to content Successful Farming Search Please fill out this field.

Editor of the daily electronic newsletter Ag Insider published by the Food and Environment Reporting Network and contributor to agriculture.com. Successful Farming's Editorial Guidelines Published on February 22, 2022 Close Photo: roibu of iStockphoto.com State and federal officials have killed tens of thousands of broiler chickens and turkeys on poultry farms in Indiana and Kentucky, and backyard flocks in three other states, while fighting outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). They are the first cases of the viral disease, which can quickly wipe out flocks, among domestic flocks in two years. Nine cases of the viral disease have been confirmed in the eastern United States in less than two weeks. Authorities believe the disease was being spread by migratory waterfowl, so they advised poultry owners to avoid contact with waterfowl or their droppings. Nearly 50 million birds, mostly laying hens and turkeys, died in an epidemic of HPAI in 2014 and 2015. READ MORE: Maine reports avian influenza in non-poultry flock The United States is one of the largest poultry exporters in the world. The USDA asked trading partners to minimize trade impacts and urged poultry farms to strengthen their safeguards against bird flu. China, South Korea, and Mexico banned poultry imports from Indiana, site of the first confirmed case of HPAI on February 8, reported Reuters. So far, outbreaks have been reported in five states. The Indiana state Board of Animal Health said 118,673 turkeys were culled on four farms, two in Dubois County and two in Greene County, in southern Indiana. Nearby farms were being tested and monitored for bird flu. "BOAH staff continue to reach out to known hobby/backyard poultry owners in the control areas to schedule testing of birds to ensure the virus is not present. To date, 32 hobby flocks have been sampled; laboratory testing determined them as negative," said the board. "Keep birds indoors to prevent poultry flocks from coming into contact with wild or migratory birds," said Kentucky state veterinarian Katie Flynn in a letter to poultry owners. "Restrict poultry access to any source of water that may have been contaminated by wild birds." Bird flu was confirmed in a flock of broiler chickens in Fulton County at the western tip of Kentucky and in a turkey flock in Webster County in western Kentucky. READ MORE: Avian influenza reported in non-poultry flock in New York Backyard flocks were destroyed in Fauquier County in northern Virginia; Knox County on Maine's midcoast; and Suffolk County, New York, on Long Island. The Maine and New York outbreaks were reported over the weekend. Bird flu was found in eight birds that were part of a small flock in Suffolk County, said WABC-TV. The USDA said the Maine outbreak involved "a non-commercial backyard flock (non-poultry)." HPAI has a high mortality rate among birds but is not considered an immediate health threat to people.

In the last 10 days, USDA confirmed infection in a non-commercial flock on Long Island, New York. The agency also confirmed infection in a non-commercial flock in Maine. There were reports of infection in wild birds in New Hampshire and Kentucky. Three additional poultry flocks in Indiana also are suspected, WTHR-TV, Indianapolis, reported (Feb. 20). The Food Institute Podcast · FI Fast Break News – Feb. 23, 2022 The bird flu outbreak could put a strain on poultry and egg supplies in the U.S., sending prices soaring amid already increasing inflation, as commercial flocks are culled to stem the spread of the virus. So far, at least 100,000 turkeys have been culled from Indiana flocks, WTHR said, with surveillance being increased throughout the state. “Once birds start dying, the entire flock is lost,” Scott Kenney of the Ohio State University Extension Service told The Food Institute. PUBLIC AWARENESS ENCOURAGED The USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service said the presence of highly pathogenic avian influenza – i.e. HPAI, or bird flu – so far has not been reported in humans, presenting no immediate public health concern. The agency cautioned, however, consumers should adhere to proper cooking instructions to kill all bacteria and viruses. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., issued a plea over the weekend for a public awareness campaign to spotlight the seriousness of the disease. “Bird flu can be very serious. The watchword is we have to nip this in the bud,” the senator told reporters. “We need early vigilance right away.” PREVENTATIVE MEASURES The outbreaks come as wild birds begin their annual migration north from the Gulf of Mexico, threatening to spread infection further. “Companies need to train personnel to recognize health issues in the flocks and report them immediately to the veterinarian in charge, such as decrease water consumption, the presence of sick birds or a sudden increase in mortality,” said Clinical Professor Alejandro Banda, of Mississippi State University’s Veterinary Research and Diagnostic Laboratory. Kenney said companies need to limit employee trips into infected areas and make sure those employees who do go into areas housing healthy birds have not been exposed to the virus elsewhere, such as “bird hunting, even walks around lakes inhabited by ducks and geese.” They also should limit access to stock by “nuisance birds like sparrows.” Nests also should be shielded from air intakes to reduce potential introduction of the virus. Andrew deCoriolis, executive director of Farm Forward, which opposes factory farms, said as long as genetically uniform animals are housed indoors by the tens of thousands, disease will spread easily and pose the threat of even more serious pathogenic mutations. “The best way to prevent the spread of highly pathogenic diseases is to prevent them from appearing in the first place, and the most obvious way to do that is by doing away with factory farms. Even the best preventative measures are only effective most of the time. Instead of asking how factory farms can prevent infections that originate in the environment, we should be asking how we can prevent infections that originate on factory farms,” deCoriolis said.

Wallis & Futuna has reported No cases of influenza and respiratory infection for the week Source: Bulletin de surveillance 04/2022 (W6 & W7). Actual increases in the number of ILI cases is seen in RMI. The increase seen in Solomon Islands may be due to the increased number of sites reported for the week. A reduction of ILI cases were seen in Wallis & Futuna, Fiji, CNMI and Cook Islands for the week. The decrease seen in New Caledonia may be due to the decreased number of sites reported for the week. Nil ILI cases were reported for the week from the Palau, Niue, and Pitcairn Islands. No reports were available from French Polynesia, Tuvalu, Tonga, Tokelau, Vanuatu, FSM and Samoa for the week. American Samoa, Guam and Nauru have not participated in the surveillance. Surveillance figures are not intended to capture all country cases but to describe trends over time and are invaluable when trends rise beyond country baselines which should then trigger alerts and timely actions to characterize the actual nature and magnitude of the disease.

And bird owners throughout the Midcoast are worried that the virus, carried primarily via wild ducks, has already infected their own backyard birds. To date, two flocks, separated by almost three miles, have been euthanized. Migratory ducks are considered the vector, as they carry the virus but do not fall ill with the disease. On Feb. 23, employees with the state’s veterinarian’s office arrived in Cushing to euthanize the second flock, three days after euthanizing 27 ducks and chicken at a nearby home, Feb. 19. The owner of the latter flock, Charly Haversat, is grieving for her birds, some which she has owned for seven years. But, she is also determined to build community awareness about the presence of pathogens that emerge with climate change. The virus will not be going away, said Haversat, and humans must learn to cope. “It is like having 27 pets die in one day,” she said. Maine’s Dept. of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, and its veterinarian division, had arrived Sunday to cull her birds. The method involves gassing, and their carcasses are composted at an approved state site. “Michelle [Walsh, state veterinarian with the Maine Dept. of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry] and her team were amazing,” she said. “The were professional and compassionate.” On Feb. 23, a similar scenario occurred just a few miles from Haversat’s Cushing home, where a larger backyard flock of non-poultry birds were euthanized, according to the Maine Dept. of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry. Until this year, it has been a rarity for the virus to even surface in the northeastern U.S., but it was detected first this year in January, along the Atlantic flyway in North Carolina, subsequently confirmed in 53 hunter-harvested wild waterfowl at three sites. The U.S. Dept. of Agriculture is keeping a running tab on where the virus has emerged. Yesterday, it was detected in a commercial chicken farm in Delaware; the day before, in Maine; prior to that, in New Hampshire, New York and Virginia. It then reports its findings to the World Organization for Animal Health and international trading partners. Resources for backyard and commercial poultry producersUSDA maintains a Defend the Flock campaign. Information about this campaign and links to toolkits containing biosecurity checklists, videos, and more, are available.Additional information and resources about HPAI and foreign animal disease preparedness are available.Maine’sAnimal Health team is also working with the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention.Though this strain of avian influenza has not been detected in humans in the United States, Maine CDC is monitoring the health and wellbeing of Animal Health staff and flock owners who were exposed out of an abundance of caution.Signs and symptoms of bird flu infections in people can include fever (temperature of 100F or greater) or feeling feverish, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, muscle or body aches, fatigue, headaches, eye redness (or conjunctivitis), and difficulty breathing.Other possible symptoms are diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.As with seasonal flu, some people are at high risk of getting very sick from bird flu infections, including pregnant women, people with weakened immune systems, and people 65 and older.The U.S. CDC provides information on avian flu transmission at this link. The Maine CDC's Health and Environmental Testing Laboratory is prepared to process samples and quickly provide results for anyone potentially exposed to the virus.Avian influenza (AI) is caused by an influenza type A virus which can infect poultry such as chickens, turkeys, pheasants, quail, domestic ducks, geese, and guinea fowl and wild birds, especially waterfowl. There are two types:Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus strains are extremely infectious, often fatal to domestic poultry, and can spread rapidly from flock to flock.Low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) virus strains occur naturally in wild migratory waterfowl and shorebirds without causing illness. LPAI can infect domestic poultry, with little or no signs of illness.The last time an outbreak of Avian flu occurred was in 2015, and while the U.S. Dept. of Agriculture said that it is not uncommon for the virus to exist in migratory birds, it is the backyard and commercial chicken populations that are vulnerable to the pathogen, which infects the lungs and manifests as a respiratory disease. At first, there was a hope that the virus would be traced to a lower level pathogen, and she would be able to quarantine her ducks, not euthanize them. But that was not the case, as the highly pathogenic strain appeared in the test. “Through our ongoing wild bird surveillance program, APHIS [Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service] collects and tests large numbers of samples from wild birds in the North American flyways,” said the USDA, in a Feb. 16 announcement of the virus. “It is not uncommon to detect avian influenza in wild birds, as avian influenza viruses circulate freely in those populations without the birds appearing sick. In addition to monitoring for avian influenza in wild bird populations, APHIS monitors for the virus in commercial and backyard birds.” Haversat said her salt pond has been a resting spot for migrating geese and ducks. Last week, two of her chickens had died. At first, she thought it had to do with natural causes – both had been rescues, and she did not know their history. But on Saturday, she went into the chicken coop and discovered a third chicken that was lethargic and puffed up, “like a basketball,” said Haversat. When that chicken died, Haversat called her vet, and the process of testing for avian flu got underway with the state’s veterinarian office. The bird tested positive for the Eurasian H5 strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza. This strain triggers a universal concern for heightened biosecurity practices, which urge solating birds from people in an enclosed environment and keeping flocks away from ponds where they might encounter migrating birds. Bird owners are to: “stay vigilant to protect poultry and pet birds from this disease. APHIS is working closely with state partners on surveillance, reporting, and control efforts.” Ducks, which are not made ill by the virus, are considered the Trojan horses to the health of domesticated poultry, with the disease carried silently in on their wings. According to the National Institute of Health: “Wild ducks are the main reservoir of influenza A viruses that can be transmitted to domestic poultry and mammals, including humans. Of the 16 hemagglutinin (HA) subtypes of influenza A viruses, only the H5 and H7 subtypes cause highly pathogenic (HP) influenza in the natural hosts. Several duck species are naturally resistant to HP Asian H5N1 influenza viruses. These duck species can shed and spread virus from both the respiratory and intestinal tracts while showing few or no disease signs. While the HP Asian H5N1 viruses are 100% lethal for chickens and other gallinaceous poultry, the absence of disease signs in some duck species has led to the concept that ducks are the ‘Trojan horses’ of H5N1 in their surreptitious spread of virus.” Maine’s Dept. of Agriculture said Feb. 23 that avian flu presents no food safety risks, and that, “poultry and eggs are safe to eat when handled and cooked properly.” All bird owners are encouraged to know the warning signs of Avian Influenza and implement steps to protect their flock.The warning signs of HPAI include:• Reduced energy, decreased appetite, and/or decreased activity• Lower egg production and/or soft-shelled or misshapen eggs• Swelling of the head, eyelids, comb and wattles• Purple discoloration of the wattles, comb and legs• Difficulty breathing, runny nares (nose), and/or sneezing• Twisting of the head and neck, stumbling, falling down, tremors and/or circling• Greenish diarrheaNo cases of this particular strain have been detected in humans in the U.S. and presents a low risk to the public. However, it is the health of the commercial chicken industry, as well as the local egg and poultry enterprises, that is at risk. Maine continues to monitor and test for the pathogen in domesticated birds. “Backyard and commercial operators are advised to keep birds indoors to prevent the spread of HPAI,” the department said. Additionally, the USDA advises that all bird owners, whether commercial producers or backyard enthusiasts, should: Practice protective security measures to help prevent disease Prevent contact between their birds and wild birds, and Report sick birds or unusual bird deaths to State/Federal officials, either through your state veterinarian or through USDA's toll-free number at 1-866-536-7593. To Haversat, the emergence of avian flu arrives when the Midcoast is exhausted by pandemics and pathogens. Many homeowners have invested in bird flocks to help eradicate ticks, which carry tick borne bacteria dangerous to humans. Now the Avian flu marches in. “This is a disease that can wipe out the livelihood of some of our neighbors,” she said. But it also is symptomatic of a changing climate. The virus is said to thrive in cold air, and even more so in rapid fluctuations of cold to warm temperatures and vice versa. “Climate change is a thing,” said Haversat. “The planet is going to go on but humans aren’t going to make out. This isn’t something that happens to other parts of the country. This is happening here in our neighborhood and is never going to go away.” She is grieving for her birds, and recognizes they were the harbinger of the virus’ emergence in Maine. “My husband and I will take to our grave that we had the first birds with avian flu in the state,” she said. But with a catch in voice, she is honoring her birds. “I’m proud that my ducks were able to provide training for the state.” It is highly unlikely that she will ever keep birds, again, even though she loved watching them from her office, overlooking the yard and pond. “I loved my birds,” she said. “I found them comforting. Over the span of three years we went from six to 30, and just gave the eggs away.” A week ago, her yard was a happy spot for wild and domesticated birds. Today it is empty. A virus landed in her salt pond and destroyed normalcy. Now it is up to other bird owners in the Midcoast to be vigilant, and knock the virus back.

The most common form of bird flu is H5N1, which can be easily contracted by humans and other animals if they come in contact with a carrier of the virus. Causes of Bird FluBird flu can spread through wild aquatic birds and can infect domestic poultry and other bird and animal species. Bird flu can spread through domestic poultry and can be transmitted to humans if they come in contact with infected bird faeces, secretions from the nose, mouth or eyes. Consumption of undercooked poultry and eggs can also cause the disease.Human-to-human transmissionIt is very rare to have human to human transmission of the same. But then people working closely with poultry must take precautionary measures and maintain proper personal hygiene. There is no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission so far.Common symptomsSome of the common symptoms of Bird flu in humans include cough, fever, headache, diarrhoea, respiratory difficulties, runny nose, sore throat, muscle aches, and malaise.Bird Flu PreventionThe best way to avoid contracting the Bird flu virus is to prevent contact with the infected carrier. One should also avoid consuming uncooked or partially cooked eggs and chicken. According to the World Health organisation (WHO), cooking of poultry (e.g. chicken, ducks and geese) at or above 70 degree Celsius, so that absolutely no meat remains raw and red, is a safe measure to kill the virus in areas with outbreaks in poultry.The virus can enter your body if you touch your eyes, nose or mouth after touching the infected bird. So practicing proper hygiene and washing hands frequently also helps reduce the risk.Richa Sareen, consultant (pulmonology) at Fortis Vasant Kunj in New Delhi, told IANS: "People who handle poultry should take special precautions. They should wear PPE, gloves and masks while handling birds and should practice frequent hand washing."Bird flu treatmentThe treatment of the disease depends on the type of bird flu. In most cases, patients are prescribed to take antiviral medication that helps reduce the severity of the condition.(Inputs from Agencies) Read Also Mumbai: Congress protest near BJP MP Manoj Kotak's office in Mulund against PM Narendra Modi's...

A total of 292 ASF cases have been reported so far this year.In a move to prevent the spread of ASF, the government will intensify operations of hunting down wild boars and searching for infected animals, while installing more fences to stop their migration, according to the agricultural ministry.It has also been enhancing disinfection measures at local farms and encouraging them to establish quarantine facilities by April.To support the farms' facility expansion, the government earmarked 14.4 billion won (US$12.05 million) this year, up from last year's 8.7 billion won, and plans to extend additional incentives to those who carry out thorough antivirus steps in advance, the ministry added."Chances of the disease affecting local farms are feared to rise starting in March due to increased farming activities and the growth in hikers, so thorough preparatory steps are required," the ministry said in a release.ASF does not affect humans but is deadly to pigs. No vaccine or cure for the disease is currently available.The government also vowed to keep in place strengthened disinfection and other quarantine steps against avian influenza.This winter season from Nov. 8 last year, the country saw a total of 44 bird flu cases at local farms, with the latest case being reported Saturday.The outbreak has slowed down in recent days along with the return of migratory birds, but the government pledged to continue regular inspections, intensive disinfection, preventive culling and other strict measures across the country, the ministry said.

A couple of common buzzards who died earlier this month have tested positive. They were tested as part of a government surveillance programme. One of the birds tested positive for H5 highly pathogenic Avian Influenza A. The other one also tested positive for that, but the authorities says 'typing' hasn't been possible. 80 cases have been confirmed in England in recent months. There have also been a high number of outbreaks in France. Jersey's Chief Vet Alistair Breed says while it's very disappointing that it's been identified in Jersey, it's not entirely surprising, given those recent outbreaks in the UK and France. "It is now even more important that bird keepers follow good biosecurity principles to prevent contact with wild birds, and house their birds if possible." Since 4 February it has been a legal requirement in Guernsey for all poultry keepers to register with the States Vet and implement specific biosecurity measures. The Committee for the Environment & Infrastructure created the Avian Influenza (Precautionary Measures) Order, 2022 so that officers would know the numbers and locations of poultry here in the event of an outbreak. Information about the law - in force until January 2023 - and Avian Influenza can be found here. “With this Order there is now a legal requirement for all poultry keepers to register their poultry with the States Veterinary Officers as well as a number of important actions from not holding bird shows to heighten your biosecurity if you keep birds. Typically this form of the disease presents suddenly, often with very high mortality, with affected birds developing swollen heads, a blue colouration for those with a comb and wattles, dullness, lack of appetite, respiratory distress, diarrhoea and significant drop in egg production." - Steve Byrne, GSPCA The UK Health Security Agency says the risk to public health is low. People are advised not to handle unwell or dead wild birds.
