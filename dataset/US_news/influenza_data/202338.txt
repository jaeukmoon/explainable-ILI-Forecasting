Password: 9r+6G%U8 “Please note special time of this COCA Call.” This COCA Call will be held on Friday, March 27, 2020 = Free Continuing Education Overview The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is preparing for co-circulating influenza virus, SARS-CoV-2, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) this fall and winter. Vaccines can provide life-saving protection against all three viral respiratory diseases. CDC recommends these vaccines for older adults, who are at a higher risk of severe illness from these diseases. Clinicians play a vital role in ensuring that older adults protect themselves by encouraging them to stay up to date on influenza, COVID-19, and RSV vaccinations. During this COCA Call, CDC presenters will provide updates about the latest recommendations and clinical considerations for administering influenza, COVID-19, and RSV vaccines to adults 60 years and older and discuss resources and communication strategies that may help facilitate older adult vaccination.

The H1N1 subtype was present in 80% of samples. European avian-like (EA) H1N2 reassortant genotypes were generated through the intercontinental movement of different viral lineages, and China was the leading source contributing to dissemination of EA swine viruses in Asia. Diverse lineages of H1 were in circulation within Cambodia, with the majority of the new H1 and N1 sequences derived from the human H1N1/pdm09 lineage, suggesting that human-to-swine transmission occurred as early as August 2017, followed by enzootic spread of a genetically distinct H1N1/pdm09 sublineage among pigs in Cambodia. Modelling studies suggested that pork production at origin was positively correlated to the spatial spread of EA H1N1 swIAV. By contrast, the consumption of pork in both origin and destination regions was negatively correlated with virus spread.Global swine populations provide a suitable environment for reassortment and human adaptation of avian and mammalian influenza viruses that can contribute to the emergence of zoonotic influenza and pandemic viruses. Zeller et al. show an increasingly complex genomic landscape of swIAV in Southeast Asia that is shaped by repeated introduction and reassortment of virus lineages, a process that is known to heighten pandemic risk. As demand for pork in the region grows, genomic surveillance at the human–swine interface will become increasingly important for early warning of disease emergence — and to avoid future pandemics.

Our specific objectives are to evaluate the lagged and interaction effects of pollution factors and construct models for estimating influenza incidence in a hierarchical manner.MethodsOur researchers collect influenza case data from 2005 to 2018 with meteorological and contaminative factors in Northeast China. We develop a generalized additive model with up to 6 months of maximum lag to analyze the impact of pollution factors on influenza cases and their interaction effects. We employ LASSO regression to identify the most significant environmental factors and conduct multiple complex regression analysis. In addition, quantile regression is taken to model the relation between influenza morbidity and specific percentiles (or quantiles) of meteorological factors.ResultsThe influenza epidemic in Northeast China has shown an upward trend year by year. The excessive incidence of influenza in Northeast China may be attributed to the suspected primary air pollutant, NO2, which has been observed to have overall low levels during January, March, and June. The Age 15–24 group shows an increase in the relative risk of influenza with an increase in PM2.5 concentration, with a lag of 0–6 months (ERR 1.08, 95% CI 0.10–2.07). In the quantitative analysis of the interaction model, PM10 at the level of 100–120 μg/m3, PM2.5 at the level of 60–80 μg/m3, and NO2 at the level of 60 μg/m3 or more have the greatest effect on the onset of influenza. The GPR model behaves better among prediction models.ConclusionsExposure to the air pollutant NO2 is associated with an increased risk of influenza with a cumulative lag effect. Prioritizing winter and spring pollution monitoring and influenza prediction modeling should be our focus. Peer Review reports IntroductionInfluenza is an acute viral respiratory illness in humans, usually characterized by fever, headache, muscle pain, weakness, nasal congestion, sore throat and cough. Seasonal epidemics of influenza viruses can spread rapidly and cause significant morbidity and mortality worldwide [1,2,3]. Globally, influenza is estimated to cause 3 to 5 million severe cases and 290,000 to 650,000 deaths related to respiratory infections every year [4]. While certain non-pharmaceutical interventions that can effectively control influenza in the early stages exist, such as the use of masks, hand washing, and other hygiene measures, or even closing schools, influenza is still a big threat to human health [5]. As evidenced by the trends of influenza incidence in such countries as Europe, the United States and Japan [6, 7], the situation remains grim and global preventive measures have little impact on the trend of influenza outbreaks. Currently few models can effectively predict influenza outbreaks. By monitoring influenza morbidity indicators on a daily basis after environmental factors that tend to predict outbreaks can be identified and modelled, we could predict influenza virus outbreaks in advance to reduce or even prevent influenza with associated costs.In early studies we can assume that air pollution may contribute to influenza-induced morbidity. An epidemiological investigation suggests that particulate matter ≤ 10 μm (PM10) and ozone (O3) should be considered when forecasting the incidence of influenza [8, 9]. Influenza viruses have been detected in polluted waters, possibly originating from bird excretion carrying the virus, as per some studies [10]. As shown in the 2002–2003 SARS pandemic and the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, influenza viruses are mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets. So air pollutants such as particulate matter (PM) and carbon monoxide (CO) may influence the transmission and prevalence of influenza viruses [11, 12]. In addition, secondary human-to-human transmission may occur and the outbreak may lead to the closure of schools and workplaces. Previous studies have investigated how meteorological factors facilitate the transmission of influenza among regions worldwide. A study in the UK showed that influenza viruses prefer low temperatures in temperate regions [13], while researchers in Canada have observed that the increase of influenza viruses is associated with low temperatures and high relative humidity [14]. The different subtypes of influenza viruses that have infected humans in recent decades include the H10N8, H5N6 and H9N2, most of which were firstly reported in China [15].Numerous studies, both domestically and internationally, have investigated the correlation between the seasonal distribution patterns of influenza and meteorological and pollution factors. In China, Yuzhou Zhang et al. [16] explored the effect of different meteorological factors on influenza incidence in Shanghai by developing a distribution lagged nonlinear model (DLNM). Some researches indicated that in the multi-day lag model, there was a statistically significant correlation between SO2, NO2 and O3 concentrations and influenza risk between lags 0 and 1 [17]. Similarly, in Nanjing, Lei Huang et al. [18] found that PM2.5 and NO2 were associated with an increase in influenza cases. Air pollutants significantly affect the susceptibility of human respiratory epithelial cells to influenza virus infection by increasing virus attachment and entry.The overall objective of this study is to explore influenza epidemic characteristics, lagged effects of pollutants and develop models suitable for predicting influenza virus outbreaks. Our specific objectives are to: a) screen environmental predictors of influenza outbreaks; b) evaluate the lagged and interaction effects of pollution factors; c) construct models for estimating influenza incidence in a hierarchical manner, selecting appropriate models for different characteristics.Materials and methodsFigure 1 shows the geographical location of the study area—Heilongjiang, Jilin and Liaoning provinces, which lie between 120° and 135° E and 40° and 53° N latitude in China. These three provinces are located in Northeast China with a medium level of economic development and population density.Fig. 1The geographical location of Northeast in ChinaThe map was created by ArcGIS 10.3 (Environmental Systems Research Institute; Redlands, CA, USA). The base map was acquired from the data center for geographic sciences and natural sources research, CAS (http://www.resdc.cn/data.aspx?DATAID=201)Full size imageWe collected influenza case surveillance data from the National Public Health Data Centre of China between 2005 and 2018. All patients are diagnosed according to the criteria of influenza management issued by the Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China. We obtained the corresponding daily weather data including air temperature, dew point temperature etc. from the China Meteorological Data Sharing Service. Pollutant information is originally from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) including CO, NO2, O3 etc.Statistical methodsTo address missing values in the influenza epidemic and meteorological pollution data, we use multiple interpolation to fill them. LASSO regression analysis is used for feature selection in response to the effects of meteorological and pollution factors. We develop quantile regression models and generalized additive models [13] with a maximum lag of 6 months to assess the extreme effects of pollution and meteorological factors on influenza cases, lags, and interactions between pollutants, respectively. Finally, we make prediction by complex regression models. All analysis in our study is performed in R software (version 4.1.3).The screening of lasso regression with environmental variablesThere are N sets of observations, each consisting of a total response variable y and p associated characteristic variables xi = (xi1, …, xip) T. A linear regression model can be set as follows:$${y}_{i}= {\beta }_{0} + \sum_{j=1}^{p}{x}_{ij}{\beta }_{j} + {e}_{i}, i=1, \cdots , N$$where β0 and β = (β1, β2, …, βp) are unknown parameters and ei is the error term. The introduction of some variables in practical problems not only complicates the calculation, but also risks increasing the data covariance, thus affecting the model fit. We can use lasso regression to estimate the parameters by solving the following problem:$${\mathrm{min}}_{\beta 0,\beta }\sum_{i=1}^{N}{\left({y}_{i}- {\beta }_{0}- \sum_{j=1}^{p}{x}_{ij}{\beta }_{j}\right)}^{2}, \parallel \beta {\parallel }_{1}\le t$$where \(\parallel\beta\parallel_1=\sum_{j=1}^p\left|\beta_j\right|\) is the \({l}_{1}\) parametrization of \(\beta\) and t is the specified tuning parameter. Overall, the lasso method improves the overall prediction accuracy, and the inclusion of the constraint term compresses the coefficients of some of the eigenvariables in the model to zero, thus enabling the selection of important variables among the many eigenvariables. The lagging and interaction effect of generalized additive model [13]The models are listed as follows (Model 1):$$log\left[E\left({Y}_{t}\right)\right]= \alpha 1+ \sum S\left(M,df,lag\right)+S\left(\mathrm{Time},df\right)+F\mathrm{actor}\left({\mathrm{Month}}_{t}\right)+{\beta Year}_{t}$$Here, Yt is the number of monthly counts of influenza cases in monthly t; α1 is the intercept of the whole model; S () is a smoothing function, and the penalty spline method is often used to smooth the parameters; M represents the estimated environmental variable related to influenza; β is the regression coefficients. The optimal degrees of freedom (df) for the spline function are estimated by Akaike information criterion for Poisson (AIC) and Minimum partial regression coefficient (PACFmin) criteria.Subsequently, we explore the interaction of pollutants on the prevalence of influenza. The model can be written as follows (Model 2):$$log\left[E\left(Yt\right)\right]= \alpha 2+ S\left({X}_{1},{X}_{2},\mathrm{lag},df\right)+S\left({\mathrm{X}}_{3},\mathrm{lag},df\right)+\sum S\left(\mathrm{M},df\right)+S\left(\mathrm{Time}, df\right)$$α2 is the intercept; X1 indicates two of the interaction factors whereas X3 denote the other one; S(X1, X2) is a spline function of the interaction between the parameters X1 and X2. M is the meteorological factors.The establishment of Gradient boosting regression tree (GBRT) and Gaussian process regression (GPR) modelIf the input training set is: T = {(× 1, y1), (× 2, y2), …, (xN, yN)}, the training samples i = 1, 2, …, N, the number of iteration rounds t = 1, 2, …, T, and the loss function is L, then the GBRT algorithm is divided into the following three steps:First, initialize the weak learner: \(f_0\left(x\right)=\mathrm{argmin}\;\sum\limits_{i=1}^N\;L\left(y_i,\;c\right)\) Next, calculate the negative gradient rti and the output of each leaf node region of the regression tree, Rtm output value ctm, and update the strong learner:$${\mathrm{r}}_{\mathrm{ti}}= -{\left[\frac{\partial \mathrm{L}\left({\mathrm{y}}_{\mathrm{i}},\mathrm{ f}\left({\mathrm{x}}_{1}\right)\right)}{\partial \mathrm{f}}\right]}_{\mathrm{f}\left(\mathrm{x}\right)={\mathrm{f}}_{\mathrm{t}-1}\left(\mathrm{x}\right)}$$$${\mathrm{c}}_{\mathrm{tm}}=\mathrm{argmin }\sum_{{\mathrm{X}}_{\mathrm{i}}\upepsilon {\mathrm{R}}_{\mathrm{tm}}}\mathrm{L}\left({\mathrm{y}}_{\mathrm{i}}, {\mathrm{f}}_{\mathrm{t}-1}\left({\mathrm{X}}_{\mathrm{i}}\right),\mathrm{ c}\right)$$$${\mathrm{f}}_{\mathrm{t}}\left(\mathrm{x}\right)= {\mathrm{f}}_{\mathrm{t}-1}\left(\mathrm{x}\right)+ \sum_{\mathrm{m}=1}^{\mathrm{M}}{\mathrm{c}}_{\mathrm{tm}}\mathrm{I}\left({\mathrm{X \epsilon R}}_{\mathrm{tm}}\right)$$Finally, get strong learners: $$f\;\left(x\right)=\;f_T\;\left(x\right)\;=f_0\left(x\right)+\sum_{t=1}^T\sum_{m=1}^M\;c_{tm}I\left(x\mathit\in R_{tm}\right)$$From a function space perspective, a Gaussian process [19] is defined to describe the distribution of the function (f(x)). The GP is the set of any finite number of random variables that have a joint Gaussian distribution, and its properties are determined entirely by the mean and covariance functions, that is:$$\left\{\begin{array}{l}\mathrm{m}\left(\mathrm{x}\right)=\mathrm{E}\left[\mathrm{f}\left(\mathrm{x}\right)\right]\\ \mathrm{k}\left(\mathrm{x}, {\mathrm{x}}^{\mathrm{^{\prime}}}\right)=\mathrm{E}\left[\left(\mathrm{f}\left(\mathrm{x}\right)-\mathrm{m}\left(\mathrm{x}\right)\right)\left(\mathrm{f}\left({\mathrm{x}}^{\mathrm{^{\prime}}}\right)-\mathrm{m}\left({\mathrm{x}}^{\mathrm{^{\prime}}}\right)\right)\right]\end{array}\right.$$where x,x' ∈ R are arbitrary random variables. Thus GP can be defined as f (x) ~ GP(m(x), k(x, x')) and the mean function is generally taken to be 0 (m(x) = 0). For the regression model as follows:$$y=f\left(x\right)+\varepsilon$$where x is the input value, f is the function value, and y is the observation plus the observation affected by noise, if noise \(\varepsilon \sim \mathrm{N}\left(0,{\upsigma }_{\mathrm{n}}^{2}\right)\) yields a priori distribution of the observation y as follows:$$\mathrm{y }\sim \mathrm{ N}\left(0,\mathrm{K}\left(\mathrm{X},\mathrm{X}\right)+{\upsigma }_{\mathrm{n}}^{2}{\mathrm{I}}_{\mathrm{n}}\right)$$ResultsInfluenza surveillance in Northeast ChinaFrom 2005 to 2018, a total of 32,989 influenza cases were reported in the three eastern provinces of China, showing an increasing trend every year (Table 1 and Fig. 1). Heilongjiang province exhibited a significantly high level of epidemic in the first few years, followed by Liaoning province, which has consistently been the main epidemic area since then and had 14,921 reported cases of influenza by 2018. Young children aged 5–14 years and young adults aged 25–59 years had the highest incidence of influenza, accounting for 55.35% of all reported cases (Table 1). Significant differences in the incidence of influenza were observed in terms of seasonality, age, and region (P < 0.05).Table 1 Distribution of the influenza cases by age, region and season group in northeast China, 2005–2018Full size tableThe screening and extreme effect for meteorological and pollutant factors among influenza prevalenceWe apply a fivefold cross-validation to select a model with small and stable error fluctuations and a parameter λ of 28.3327. The results of the runs are shown in Fig. 2 and Table S1. After the initial selection of the lasso method, six of the variable variables including air temperature (AT), dew point temperature (DPT), sea level pressure (SLP), NO2, PM10 and PM2.5 are selected and the coefficients of the other independent variables are contracted to zero.Fig. 2The process of lasso regression variable screeningFull size imageExposure–response relationships for pollutants with different lag timesFrom the line graph of Figure S1 regression coefficients, we can see that SLP does not fluctuate at different levels, while PM2.5 fluctuates at different concentrations, but the overall effect increases with the quantile. In addition, PM10, NO2 and AT has a negative effect on influenza incidence at different levels, and the overall effect also increases with the quantile. Significant differences were observed between the age groups of 25–59 years and 60 + year. In Table 2 and Fig. 3, in the single-pollutant model we find a negative association between short-term exposure to NO2 (within 1 month) and monthly influenza incidence (ERR-2.68% (-4.72%, -0.60%)), and this implies that low levels of NO2 may be the most responsible air pollutant for excess influenza incidence. The Age 25–59 years group is the most susceptible to NO2, followed by the Age 0–4 years group, and the ERR increases with lag in both groups, with essentially no lag in the 60 + years age group. NO2 showed a positive correlation with influenza incidence in patients aged 15–24 and 25–59 years at a 3-month lag. At a 5-month lag, there was a positive correlation between influenza incidence and NO2 in patients aged 0–4, 15–24, and 25–59 years. At a maximum lag time of 6 months, the influenza incidence in patients aged 15–24 shows a positive correlation with PM2.5.Table 2 Cumulative ERR of each pollutant at different lags (Unit: %)Full size tableFig. 3The associations between ambient air pollution and monthly Influenza prevalence with total and all agesFull size imageInteraction and comparison of multiple-pollutant modelWe develop a multi-pollutant model with a single-day lagged ERR maximum and significance test, yielding a lagged day of 5 days for PM10, PM2.5 and 4 days for NO2. Figure S2 revealed that PM10 has interactive effects with PM2.5 and NO2 on influenza incidence. Additionally, there is a weak positive correlation between pollutants and the risk of incidence. Moreover, ambient temperature (AT) exhibits positive correlation with the risk of incidence at low temperatures and inverse correlation at high temperatures, while dew point temperature (DPT) shows an inverse trend compared to AT. Figure 4 indicated a non-linear effect of pollutants on influenza onset, with PM10 levels of 100–120 μg/m3 and PM2.5 levels of 60–80 μg/m3, and NO2 levels above 60 μg/m3 exhibiting the greatest impact. Results from the statistical test presented in Table 3 suggest that the PM10 and PM2.5 interaction model is better (R2 = 99.1%). These findings demonstrate the significant impact of air pollutants on influenza onset.Fig. 4The fitting interactions of the association among pollutants and Influenza cases based on the generalized additive modelFull size imageTable 3 Test of interaction model of multiple pollution factorsFull size tableFrom the comparison of the parameters of the two modelling approaches in Table 4, the model fit is the best in Liaoning Province among different regions (R2 > 70%), and the model fit is the best among Age 25–59 groups, while the GPR model shows the same fit as the GBRT model.Table 4 Comparison of the prediction results with the gradient boosted regression tree (GBRT) and gaussian distribution regression (GPR) modelsFull size tableDiscussionBased on this study, it is determined that influenza epidemics in the northeastern region of China exhibit pronounced seasonality of winter-spring and demonstrate an upward trend annually. Prior to 2018, the province of Liaoning continued to be the primary epicenter of influenza outbreaks within the northeastern region, with a higher prevalence of cases observed among young children and adolescents, which could be attributed to their relatively weaker immune systems rendering them more susceptible to influenza viral infections [20].Our single-pollutant lagged modeling yields intriguing results, indicating that lower concentrations of NO2 in January, March, and June may be the primary contributing factor to excessive influenza incidence. Exposure to NO2 can lead to reduced virus-specific immunity and increased cellular inflammation, potentially causing the onset of influenza virus, regardless of whether it occurs before or after respiratory virus infection. The relative risk of influenza associated with NO2 exposure increased with higher NO2 concentrations in the age groups of 0–4, 15–24, and 25–59. This suggests that young adults may have a higher susceptibility to influenza under NO2 exposure due to the rapid release of immune cells stimulated by the virus, resulting in an increased relative release of immune cells. The disruption of immune cell homeostasis caused by the rapid release of immune cells stimulated by influenza viruses may explain the higher susceptibility of young adults to influenza under NO2 exposure. This could be the result of a relative increase in immune cell release in this age group [21]. In the age group of 15–24, the relative risk of influenza associated with PM2.5 exposure increased with higher PM2.5 concentrations at lag 0–6 months. This suggests that long-term exposure to high levels of PM2.5 beyond 6 months may increase the risk of influenza. This was similar to the results of a monitoring study that found: Age 0–4 were significantly susceptible to PM10 and NO2; Age 5–14 were significantly susceptible to PM2.5 and PM10; and Age 15–24 were significantly susceptible to all air pollutants analyzed [18]. During the remaining lag months with low concentrations of PM2.5, PM10 and NO2, the onset of influenza is mainly attributed to factors other than air pollution, as indicated by ERR < 0. This may be due to low levels of external pollution, which increase population activity during high influenza season (spring, winter) and result in aggregated activity, thereby enhancing the risk of influenza.The longitudinal study shows that the highest overall risk (ERR) of influenza onset is observed for pollutants with a lag of 5–6 months, indicating that long-term exposure to pollutants may primarily promote influenza onset. However, in the age groups of 15–24 and 60 + , NO2 exposure is associated with a higher risk of influenza onset at an early stage. The lagged effects of PM2.5, PM10 and NO2 are characterized by a bimodal distribution, with a significant decrease in the risk of influenza onset during the first 2 months of exposure. However, the risk of influenza onset is found to be higher during the 2nd-3rd and 4th-5th months of exposure to these pollutants. Several studies have suggested that influenza viruses exhibit higher sensitivity and pathogenicity during the winter season, based on experimental findings [22]. This might also be consistent with the findings of some surveys: The correlation between air pollutants and influenza varies by season and region, with higher effects estimated for the cold season, eastern and central regions, and provinces with wetter conditions and larger populations [23]. In the multi-pollutant lagged interaction model, ambient temperature (AT) is found to be positively correlated with the risk of influenza onset at low temperatures, while pollutants are only weakly positively correlated with the risk of morbidity. This suggests that lower temperatures may facilitate the spread of pollutants, thereby exacerbating the spread of influenza viruses and causing the onset of influenza. These findings are consistent with the seasonal characteristics of influenza onset, which predominantly occur during the winter and spring seasons in this study. The quantitative analysis of interaction models reveals that the interaction between PM10 and PM2.5 has a more significant effect on influenza onset. Several studies have suggested that particulate matter (PM) may stimulate macrophage apoptosis in lung tissue, which could exacerbate the damage caused by influenza viruses to the respiratory tract. This may explain why the combined effect of PM10 and PM2.5 is more detrimental to influenza onset [24].During heavy pollution, reduced outdoor activities and increased indoor activities can heighten the risk of influenza [25]. Hence, the significance of the current study lies in the investigation of the link between pollutants and the development of influenza, which is in line with various domestic and international studies [17, 26, 27].Temperature and sea level pressure are the most relevant meteorological factors in our study, as they can affect the transmission of pathogens and impact human immune function, leading to respiratory disease development [28,29,30]. In our final GAM model, we did not find a significant association between meteorological factors and influenza incidence. This may be due to the potential confounding effect of regional environment and lifestyle habits on the transmission of influenza.Our analysis involves multiple models exploring the relationship between environmental factors and influenza incidence, and subsequent subgroup analyses demonstrate significant differences in the predictions made by region and age group. Interestingly, the Gaussian process regression (GPR) model outperforms the Gradient Boosting Regression Tree (GBRT) model in terms of predictive accuracy. In conclusion, the study suggests that Liaoning Province is proficient in predicting influenza outbreaks and accounting for environmental factors. Moreover, it serves as a suitable representative region for the northeastern part of China. Our study also finds that the model's fit and validation are satisfactory for the age group of 25–59 years, who are susceptible to influenza outbreaks. However, the predictive stability is suboptimal for the age group of 5–14 years, possibly due to the clustering of young individuals during the cold season.It is notable that our study quantifies the impact of various factors on influenza incidence. The use of the GAM model allows us to control important confounding factors and examine the long-term monthly lagged effects of co-exposure to PM10 and PM2.5. However, it should be noted that our study is conducted at an aggregate level and does not involve individual-level analysis. And the data is only collected from the Northeast region, so caution is needed when extending our findings to other regions. However, our study provides a starting point for future population epidemiology studies with larger samples and broader geographic coverage.

September and October are the best months for older adults to get their flu vaccines to protect against the influenza virus, also known as the “flu.”This year, the CDC also recommends that adults 60 and older get the newly updated COVID vaccine and talk to their doctor about the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine.Federal health officials recommend specific flu vaccines for people age 65 and older: Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent, Flublok Quadrivalent, and Fluad Quadrivalent.Early fall is the best time for older adults to get their flu vaccines to protect against the influenza virus, also known as the “flu.” This year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also recommends that adults 60 and older get the newly updated COVID vaccine and talk to their doctor about the respiratory syncytial respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine. Both the latest flu vaccine and the RSV vaccine are available now. And so is an updated COVID vaccine approved by federal health officials in mid-September.1 Enter your ZIP code at vaccines.gov to find places near you offering flu and updated COVID vaccines. If you have questions about which vaccines are best for you or when to get them—or how long to wait after a previous booster or COVID infection before getting the most recently approved vaccine—talk to your doctor. The importance of flu shots for older adults The single best way to reduce your risk from flu and possibly serious complications is to get the flu shot every year. Here are some flu facts to help explain why getting your vaccine is so important. What is influenza or flu? Are influenza (flu) and COVID-19 caused by the same virus? The answer is no. Influenza is a highly contagious respiratory infection caused by the influenza virus. The flu virus is different from the coronavirus, and two different vaccines are required for protection. Individuals who have had the COVID-19 vaccine or are planning to be vaccinated against COVID-19 can safely get the flu shot this year and every year. Although they are caused by different viruses, there are some similarities between COVID-19 and flu. Just like COVID-19, flu is easily passed from person to person when someone coughs, talks, or sneezes. You can also catch the flu virus from recently contaminated surfaces or objects that have the virus on them and then touch your mouth, eyes, or nose. What are the symptoms of flu? Some symptoms of flu are similar to the common cold, like sneezing, cough, sore throat, and chest discomfort. However, flu usually starts more quickly and symptoms are much more severe than the common cold. Flu symptoms also include fever, body aches, chills, headaches, and feeling tired. People often ask, “Can you get the flu from the flu shot?” No, you cannot. The flu shot is made from inactive (dead) virus that can't cause influenza infection. However, you may get brief, mild side effects from the flu vaccine that can feel almost flu-like. Why are older adults at higher risk for flu? While each flu season differs in severity, during most seasons, people 65 years and older bear the greatest burden of disease. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that between 70-85% of seasonal flu-related deaths and between 50-70% of seasonal flu-related hospitalizations occurred in older adults.2 People 65+ are at higher risk of developing serious complications from flu compared with younger adults. This increased risk is due in part to declines in immune response with age. Older adults with chronic conditions, like heart disease, diabetes, and lung disease, such as asthma or COPD, are at highest risk for developing life-threatening complications from the flu. Because of age-related changes in their immune systems, people 65 years and older may not respond as well to vaccination as younger people. Although immune responses may be lower in older people, studies have found that flu vaccine has been effective in reducing the risk of doctor visits and hospitalizations due to the flu. In addition, high dose vaccines and an adjuvanted flu vaccine are available; adjuvanted flu vaccine includes an additive that provide a higher immune response. These vaccines have been shown to more effective in older adults in producing a stronger immune response and reducing illness compared to the standard flu vaccine shot. Your doctor or pharmacist will recommend which flu vaccine is best for you. Why are flu shots needed every year? If you’re concerned about how to prevent catching the flu from someone, getting a flu vaccine is your best bet. CDC recommends that almost everyone 6 months and older get a seasonal flu vaccine every year, ideally by the end of October. However, as long as flu viruses are circulating, vaccination should continue throughout flu season, even into January or later. Flu vaccines are updated each season to keep up with changing viruses. Also, immunity against the flu virus decreases over a year so annual vaccination is needed to make sure everyone has the best possible protection against flu. Because immunity may decrease more quickly in older people, it is especially important that older adults are not vaccinated too early like in July or August. Federal health officials recommend specific flu vaccines for people age 65 and older. These vaccines are Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent, Flublock Quadrivalent, and Fluad Quadrivalent. Studies have shown they trigger a better immune response in older adults than the traditional flu vaccine.3,4 If you are 65 or older, ask for one of these vaccines when you are getting your flu shot from your doctor, pharmacists, or a vaccine clinic. But if one of these vaccines is not available or will not be available soon, a traditional flu shot is recommended. What about the pneumococcal vaccine? Pneumonia is an example of a serious flu-related complication that can cause death. People who are 65 years and older also should be up to date with pneumococcal vaccine to protect against pneumococcal disease, such as pneumonia, meningitis, and bloodstream infections. Talk to your doctor to find out which pneumococcal vaccine is recommended for you. If you are not up to date on your pneumococcal vaccine, you can get that vaccine when you get a flu vaccine. Does Medicare cover vaccines? Medicare Part B covers both the flu shot and pneumococcal vaccines with no out-of-pocket costs to Medicare beneficiaries. Schedule your fall flu shot According to the CDC, the best months for most people to get vaccinated against the flu are September and October. It's important to note that it takes about two weeks after the flu shot to develop antibodies or protection against the flu virus. Getting your annual flu shot can help you stay active, healthy, and independent. Ask your health care provider which flu vaccine is right for you.

According to the World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH), the first outbreak began on May 29 in Mpumalanga province in the eastern part of the country. The outbreaks have spread to farms in four other provinces: Gauteng, Free State, Limpopo, and Northwest. Matt MacGillivray/Flickr cc Shahn Bisschop, DVM, who heads Avimune, a poultry veterinary service in South Africa, told media outlets that the H7N6 strain—new to the country—appears to be far more contagious than the H5N1 virus spreading in the rest of the world. He said South Africa is already experiencing egg shortages and may start to face meat shortages within 4 to 6 weeks. Animal health officials aren't sure if the onset of warmer weather during the Southern Hemisphere's summer season will slow the spread of the virus, and discussions are under way about emergency use of a vaccine to help the poultry industry recover. COVID vaccination after long COVID may be linked to better outcomes News brief Stephanie Soucheray, MA Topics COVID-19 A new observational study from Canadian researchers reveals that COVID vaccination after long COVID was tied to fewer symptoms, increased well-being, and less inflammation. The study, based on participants in Montreal, is published in the International Journal of Infectious Diseases. Long COVID, or post-COVID condition (PCC), is a major emerging public health issue, as 10% to 30% of COVID-19 patients who are not hospitalized, and 50% to 70% hospitalized patients, experience an array of symptoms lasting more than 12 weeks after acute infection. While vaccination may protect against severe disease and hospitalization, less is known about how vaccination after PCC diagnosis affects patients. In the present study, 83 participants previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 who were diagnosed as having PCC before COVID vaccination were followed for up to 24 months. Participants were enrolled in the study from February 12 to September 8, 2021. Forty-four had not yet received a COVID-19 vaccine at the beginning of the study, while the remaining 39 had already received one or two doses. Vaccination linked to lower cytokines The five most common PCC symptoms reported at the beginning of the study were fatigue (81.9%), trouble with concentration (47.0%), trouble with memory (39.8%), headache (32.5%) and shortness of breath at rest (31.3%) during all follow-ups. After vaccination, 77.8%, 7.4%, and 14.8% of participants reported improved, worsened and unchanged well-being scores, respectively, the authors said. And 86%, 8.3% and 5.6% of participants reported fewer, more, and the same number of PCC symptoms, respectively. We observed a significant reduction in systemic inflammatory cytokine/chemokine levels post-vaccination, independent of number of vaccine doses received. Sixteen cytokines and chemokines were significantly decreased after vaccination in participant blood samples, a sign that inflammatory proteins were mitigated by vaccination. "High inflammatory cytokine/chemokine levels have been correlated with increased acute COVID-19 severity and poor prognosis," the authors concluded. "We observed a significant reduction in systemic inflammatory cytokine/chemokine levels post-vaccination, independent of number of vaccine doses received." YouTube sent users to less relevant—not anti-vax—videos amid COVID, study suggests News brief Mary Van Beusekom, MS Topics Anti-science COVID-19 Esther Vargas / Flickr cc Researchers from UN Global Pulse, the United Nations' innovation lab, uncover no strong evidence that the YouTube video-sharing platform promoted anti-vaccine content during the COVID-19 pandemic. "However, the watch histories of users significantly affect video recommendations, suggesting that data from the application programming interface or from a clean browser do not offer an accurate picture of the recommendations that real users are seeing," the researchers wrote of the findings, published late last week in the Journal of Medical Internet Research. The team asked World Health Organization (WHO)-trained participants and workers from the Amazon Mechanical Turk crowdsourcing tool to find an anti-vaccine video in the fewest clicks, starting from a WHO COVID-19 video. They compared the recommendations the users saw to related videos and recommended "up-next" videos seen through clean browsers without tracking software. YouTube has stated its commitment to removing content that contains misinformation on vaccination. Nevertheless, such claims are difficult to audit. Using machine-learning methods, the researchers then identified anti-vaccine content among 27,074 video recommendations. Promoted anti-vaccine content stayed under 6% There was no evidence that YouTube funneled users toward anti-vaccine content, with the average proportion of such videos staying below 6%. Instead, YouTube's algorithms pointed users to non–vaccine-related health content. "The videos that users were directed to were longer and contained more popular content, and attempted to push a blockbuster strategy to engage users by promoting other reliably successful content across the platform," lead author Margaret Yee Man Ng, PhD, said in a University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) news release. Ng is also a journalism professor at UIUC. The authors noted that there have been significant concerns about the contribution of social media to vaccine hesitancy throughout the pandemic. For example, Facebook removed some COVID-19 misinformation starting in 2020, but a recent study revealed that users just found other ways to access and spread it. "YouTube has stated its commitment to removing content that contains misinformation on vaccination," the researchers wrote. "Nevertheless, such claims are difficult to audit. There is a need for more empirical research to evaluate the actual prevalence of antivaccine sentiment on the internet." Genomic analysis uncovers syphilis transmission networks in England News brief Chris Dall, MA Topics Antimicrobial Stewardship Sexually Transmitted Infections A study by scientists in the United Kingdom provides some new insight into how syphilis—including antibiotic-resistant strains—is spreading in England. The findings, published late last week in The Lancet Microbe by researchers with the UK Health Security Agency and the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, come amid an uptick in syphilis cases in England, which has seen infectious syphilis diagnoses more than triple since 2010. UK health officials believe the rise in syphilis cases reflects both increased testing and transmission, particularly among men who have sex with men (MSM). In the study, researchers performed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of samples of Treponema pallidum, the bacterium that causes syphilis, collected from across England from January 2012 through October 2018. Of the 237 genomes that were sequenced, 180 (76%) were from MSM, and about half (118, 49.8%) were from London. Roughly 90% of the genomes contained mutations conferring resistance to macrolide antibiotics. Discrete clusters associated with sexual behavior Phylogenomic analysis and clustering revealed two dominant T pallidum sublineages in England: sublineage 1, which was found throughout England and across all patient groups, and sublineage 14, which was found predominantly in MSM ages 34 and older in and around London, with no cases found in the northern regions of England. Further analysis revealed several instances representing discrete heterosexual transmission networks or clusters. "Our identification of discrete clusters associated with sexual behaviour suggests WGS combined with detailed epidemiological data can resolve some local transmission chains for T pallidum," the study authors wrote. "This could offer opportunities to intervene or educate sexual networks, and to determine or exclude outbreak membership." Our identification of discrete clusters associated with sexual behaviour suggests WGS combined with detailed epidemiological data can resolve some local transmission chains for T pallidum The authors say the study demonstrates how genomic surveillance can help with efforts to address the spread of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). "While its use will need to be investigated further, genomic surveillance could provide a step change in our ability to understand and inform surveillance, prevention, and treatment strategies for a broad range of STIs," senior study author Nicolas Thomson, PhD, said in a press release. Quick takes: Universal flu vaccine trial launch, MERS vaccine trial in seniors, funds for mRNA mpox vaccine News brief Lisa Schnirring Topics Influenza Vaccines MERS-CoV Mpox The US National Institutes of Health (NIH) recently announced the launch of a phase 1 clinical trial of a universal flu vaccine, which is sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and will take place at the NIH's Clinical Center in Bethesda. The vaccine candidate, called Flu-Mos-v2, is an adaptation of Flu-Mos-v1. Both were developed by NIAID researchers. Flu-Mos-v1 entered clinical trials in 2021. The newer version targets six strains, including four influenza A strains and two influenza B strains. The original version of the vaccine targets four flu strains. The University of Oxford's Pandemic Sciences Institute today announced the launch of a phase 1 clinical trial of a MERS-CoV vaccine. Currently, there are no vaccines or treatments for infections involving MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus). The vaccine uses a ChAdOx1 platform and has already been tested in young adults in the United Kingdom and Saudi Arabia. The new trial, the third involving the vaccine, is the first in older people. Vaccitech has acquired the commercial rights to the vaccine and is collaborating with Oxford and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) to develop the product. BioNTech and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) today announced the launch of a partnership to advance the development of an mRNA-based vaccine against mpox. The vaccine is part of a $90 million CEPI 100 Days Mission to support the development of mRNA vaccine candidates to address potential pandemic pathogens within 100 days of identifying the threat. Also, the program is part of BioNTech's plan to develop novel vaccines against diseases with large medical impacts, including those that disproportionately affect lower-income countries. The BioNTech mpox vaccine candidate, BNT166, encodes surface antigens against the two infectious forms of mpox. The phase 1/2 trial will enroll 196 healthy participants with and without a history of smallpox vaccination.

Search Give Yourself a Boost! 8 life hacks to fight the flu Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Pinterest E-mail Print Fighting the flu, or preventing it from spreading to you or others, includes a simple, tactical plan — adopting healthy habits and boosting your immune system. Check out our flu-fighting tips — or “life hacks” — to help you thrive during flu season and beyond. Let’s give your immune system a boost to help fight the flu! What is influenza (flu)? To understand why we need to fight it, let’s first define it. Influenza (flu) is an infection caused by a virus that makes you feel very sick, often with fever, headache, body aches and coughing. In other words, it can make you miserable and even cause other health complications. Doesn’t my body naturally boost my immune system? The immune system is the body’s natural defense system that helps fight off viruses and bacteria to protect you from getting sick. The immune system recognizes a foreign substance (such as a virus or bacteria) as potentially harmful and sends antibodies (proteins made by the immune system) to destroy it. Where to Get Your Flu Shot ChristianaCare. Your local retail pharmacy or community flu clinic. Other locations near you: Vaccines.gov/find-vaccines. Think of the immune system like the inner workings of a car or truck. When you keep a vehicle running well with healthy habits by taking it for regular oil changes and tune-ups, keeping the air in the tires and getting parts replaced when they wear out — you get the idea — it runs at peak performance. That’s what we should aim for with our immune systems – to keep them running at peak performance by boosting them with healthy lifestyle habits. Immune-boosting life hacks Eat healthy. Look for foods rich in nutrients like Vitamins A, C and E which can help your body fight off illness. Think of red and orange fruits and green, leafy vegetables. Vitamin D, which is found in fatty fish and milk, also gives a boost. In addition to healthy nutrients, talk with your health care provider before adding any supplements to ensure there are no medication or health condition interactions. Exercise. Use exercise as a tool in your immune system’s arsenal to fight the flu! As long as approved by your health care provider, you should get at least 30 minutes of moderate cardio like walking, biking, jogging, swimming or running at least five times per week. Aim for 150 active minutes each week. Wash your hands. Don’t take this simple gesture for granted. Washing hands saves lives. Not sure you’re washing them long enough? Sing a tune in your head (or out loud) while washing for 20 seconds. The chorus of “Stayin’ Alive” by the Bee Gees or “Take on Me” by A-ha will cover you. Sleep well. People who don’t get quality sleep or enough sleep are more likely to get sick after exposure to a virus, such as the flu. Getting plenty of sleep helps prevent the flu since it helps sustain the functioning of your immune system. When your immune system is more robust, you will feel less fatigue. Get sunshine. Vitamin D reduces infections such as the flu, and you’ll get more of it by getting more sunlight. Vitamin D helps the immune system fight off bacteria and viruses, like the influenza virus. Don’t forget your sunscreen and yes, you will still get Vitamin D from the sun while wearing sunscreen! Drink more water. Staying hydrated helps keep mucus membranes of your nasal passages moist so they can catch viruses before they invade your body. It also helps flush out toxins and keep your immune system running smoothly. Avoid alcohol and cigarettes. Over time, alcohol can weaken the immune system. Smoking can make the body less successful at fighting disease and increases the risk of immune system problems. Get the flu vaccination. The flu vaccination has historically been the best way to reduce the risk of seasonal flu and its potentially serious complications each year. The CDC has recommended everyone six months and older receive the flu vaccination, especially those ages 65 and older.

Download PDF Copy By Tarun Sai LomteReviewed by Lily Ramsey, LLMSep 19 2023 In a recent study published in JAMA Network Open, researchers assessed whether a high-dose influenza vaccine is associated with a benefit in reducing cardiopulmonary (CP) events during periods of influenza activity. Study: Temporal Association Among Influenza-Like Illness, Cardiovascular Events, and Vaccine Dose in Patients With High-Risk Cardiovascular Disease. Image Credit: BaLL LunLa/Shutterstock.com Background Influenza is associated with a higher risk of CP events. Seasonal influenza outbreaks primarily occur in winter when transmission is more favorable. Moreover, cardiovascular (CV) events exhibit similar temporal patterns. Studies have reported associations between CV events and influenza. Additionally, observational studies and trials suggest that the influenza vaccine might reduce adverse CV outcomes. INVESTED, a randomized clinical trial, evaluated the effectiveness of the high-dose trivalent influenza vaccine over the standard-dose quadrivalent vaccine in people with high CV risk during the 2016-19 influenza seasons. It did not find an increased benefit of the high dose relative to the standard regimen for the primary endpoint. It is unknown whether the efficacy of the treatment varies at times of increased influenza-like illness (ILI) activity. About the study In the present study, researchers examined whether high-dose influenza vaccine influenced the events associated with ILI activity. This was a pre-specified secondary analysis of the specified trial conducted across Canada and the United States (US) between September 2016 and July 2019. Patients with high CV disease (CVD) risk previously hospitalized for myocardial infarction (MI) or heart failure (HF) were randomized to receive a standard- or high-dose vaccine for influenza.

The team included data from 108 sites and territories. Race or ethnicity was self-reported by patients. The researchers used logistic regression models to compare weekly ILI with the occurrence of the primary and secondary outcomes. The primary outcome was a composite of CP hospitalization or all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included pulmonary hospitalization, CV hospitalization, and death. The temporal association between exposure and development was assessed using weekly ILI activity with up to nine weeks of lag from the outcome. Models were adjusted for demographics, enrolment strata, state, and CV risk factors. The weekly odds of the (occurrence of the) primary outcome by treatment group (standard- or high-dose) were assessed using logistic regression models. Sensitivity analyses were performed to examine the associations of ILI activity with outcomes during periods of higher influenza or ILI activity. Findings In total, 3,094 US participants aged, on average, 65, were included. Nearly 75% of subjects were males, 72.3% were White, and 22.3% were Black. About 12.1%, 21.7%, and 76% had a prior MI, HF hospitalization, and HF, respectively. Overall, 1,396 primary outcome events, 183 pulmonary hospitalizations, 1,141 CV hospitalizations, and 322 deaths occurred during 129,285 person-weeks of enrolment. The highest average ILI activity was recorded during the 2017-18 season. Increased ILI activity in the past week was associated with elevated risks of primary outcome events, CV hospitalization, and CP hospitalization. There was no association of ILI activity with pulmonary hospitalizations or all-cause mortality. In addition, there was a lower risk of these events during warmer months in the US (July to September). The high-dose influenza vaccine was not superior to the standard dose in its association with the risk of primary outcome events, even when the analysis was restricted to periods of higher influenza or ILI activity. Conclusions The findings demonstrated a temporal association of ILI with CV and CP hospitalizations in high CVD-risk patients but not with all-cause mortality. A higher dose relative to the standard dose of the influenza vaccine did not influence this association, even during periods of higher ILI or influenza activity. Additionally, there was an association between warmer months and decreased CV risk, independent of the local ILI activity. Although the benefit of vaccination relative to placebo was not determined, vaccination would likely be substantially beneficial to placebo in this high-risk population. Besides, other respiratory viruses may also contribute to the association since influenza is not the only virus circulating in winter months. Together, in this secondary analysis of the INVESTED trial, influenza activity was temporally associated with a higher risk of CP events. Yet, the higher vaccine dose did not reduce this risk.

It's a worrying sign for scientists, who have sounded alarms since the pathogen moved from a seasonal concern to a potential pandemic spillover in 2021.The birds, two frigate birds and one red-footed booby, were confirmed H5N1 casualties after testing on the Ecuadorian mainland."Preliminarily, of the five specimens examined, three of them have tested positive for H5N1 avian influenza," said Galapagos National Park in a statement.In the last two years, more than half a billion farmed birds have died or been culled due to the virus, and conservative estimates suggest hundreds of thousands of wild birds across the globe have died. It's also killed thousands of sea lions in South America. Skunks, mink, dogs and some humans have also been infected.While H5N1 has now spanned the globe, its presence in the Galapagos puts a spotlight on how difficult this virus is to contain, particularly since it is so prevalent in shorebirds and migratory birds.In the Galapagos Islands, 80% of birds are endemic. The arrival of H5N1 makes all bird species incredibly vulnerable.While avian influenza has been circulating for decades, intensive farming and virus mutations have seen it spread in novel ways, and scientists have sounded the alarm it's the most likely source of a new pandemic.To date, Antarctica and Australia are the only continents without reported avian influenza outbreaks among wild birds.Source: Galapagos Conservation Trust Tags Infectious DiseasesGalapagosCharles DarwinBirdsInfluenza Facebook Twitter Flipboard LinkedIn No comments Bronwyn Thompson Bronwyn has always loved words and animals, and she has the journalism and zoology degrees to prove it.

Credit: Student Affairs Communications & Marketing. All Rights Reserved.September 22, 2023UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. — Flu season is quickly approaching, and University Health Services (UHS) encourages students to get vaccinated at their annual student flu clinics and through their #FightFluPSU campaign. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the flu is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses. If not treated, it can result in mild to severe illness and, at times, cause death. The initiative #FightFluPSU is an annual campaign run by University Health Services to help raise awareness among students about the importance of getting the flu shot and grant Penn State students the opportunity to get vaccinated. “Cohort living, crowded lecture halls, and countless social activities make college students particularly susceptible to spreading flu viruses,” says UHS Infection Control Nurse Manager, Cecilia Devonshire. “Annual flu shots are the best way to protect yourself and those around you from getting flu. While there is still a chance of contracting flu even after vaccination, symptoms are often less severe. This means lowering the risk of missing classes, getting behind on assignments and missing out on time spent with friends. UHS hopes that by offering more opportunities for vaccination at the student health center, students will take a proactive approach to protecting themselves this flu season”. The student flu clinics will be open from Sept. 28 through Dec. 5 in 204/205 Student Health Center from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Students wishing to attend must make an appointment via myUHS. Walk-ins are not permitted. The dates are as follows: Thursday, Sept. 28 Tuesday, Oct. 3 Monday, Oct. 9 Friday, Oct. 13 Tuesday, Oct. 17 Thursday, Oct. 19 Monday, Oct. 23 Thursday, Oct. 26 Tuesday, Nov. 7 Friday, Nov. 10 Wednesday, Nov. 29 Tuesday, Dec. 5 The flu vaccination is covered by most health insurances, but resources are available for students who have concerns about the cost. Students can reach out to the UHS case manager at 814-865-4UHS (4847) for more information. Before arriving at their appointment, students must complete all required forms in myUHS, upload their health insurance card, and bring their student ID with them to the visit. UHS will administer the Fluarix Quadrivalent flu vaccine, which is thimerosal-free and latex-free. Students also can schedule a private appointment with a UHS provider — separate from the clinic — to receive a flu vaccine via myUHS. Students at Commonwealth Campus locations are encouraged to contact their on-campus health service, if applicable, or a local provider to inquire about clinics in their area. More information on the flu clinics and #FightFluPSU can be found on the UHS flu webpage.

Carlock1,3 & Ted M. Ross1,2,3,4 nAff5 Scientific Reports volume 13, Article number: 15911 (2023) Cite this article 2222 Accesses 6 Citations 77 Altmetric Metrics details Subjects ImmunologyVaccines AbstractInfluenza B viruses (IBV) can cause severe disease and death much like influenza A viruses (IAV), with a disproportionate number of infections in children. Despite moving to a quadrivalent vaccine to include strains from both the B/Victoria and B/Yamagata lineages, vaccine effectiveness rates continue to be variable and low in many past seasons. To develop more effective influenza B virus vaccines, three novel IBV hemagglutinin (HA) vaccines were designed using a computationally optimized broadly reactive antigen (COBRA) methodology. These IBV HA proteins were expressed on the surface of a virus-like particle (VLP) and used to vaccinate ferrets that were pre-immune to historical B/Victoria or B/Yamagata lineage viruses. Ferrets vaccinated with B-COBRA HA vaccines had neutralizing antibodies with high titer HAI titer against all influenza B viruses regardless of pre-immunization history. Conversely, VLPs expressing wild-type IBV HA antigens preferentially boosted titers against viruses from the same lineage and there was little-to-no seroprotective antibodies detected in ferrets with mismatched IBV pre-immune infections. Overall, a single IBV HA developed using the COBRA methodology elicited protective broadly-reactive antibodies against current and future drifted IBVs from both lineages.

In addition, severe infection with influenza viruses results in hundreds of thousands of deaths every year1,2. Prevention of influenza virus infection by vaccination is the best way to minimize severe cases. Two types of influenza, A and B, co-circulate in the human population. Influenza A viruses (IAV) are subdivided into subtypes based upon the surface hemagglutinin (HA or H) and neuraminidase (NA or N). Currently, H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes have co-circulated in people since 1968. Influenza B viruses (IBV) were first isolated in 1940 and, in some seasons, IBVs are the dominant type isolated from people during flu season, though this can vary regionally and throughout a season as IAV and IBV can peak at different times1,2. During the 1988–1989 influenza season, an IBV strain antigenically distinct to the vaccine strain, B/Victoria/2/1987 (B/VIC/87), was detected. And by the next season, half of the isolates matched this new strain, B/Yamagata/16/1988 (B/YAM/88)3. As a result, IBV strains were categorized based on whether they were Victoria-like (B/VIC) or Yamagata-like (B/YAM)4,5,6. Viruses from the two lineages co-circulated afterwards, but similar to H1N1 and H3N2 IAVs, one lineage would out compete the other each flu season. From 2001 to 2012, the lineage recommended as the vaccine strain component changed six times7 and the predominant influenza B lineage selected for the vaccine matched the dominant circulating IBV lineage ~ 50% of the time8. In 2012, representatives from both IBV lineages were recommended for a quadrivalent influenza vaccine that resulted in increased vaccine effectiveness against influenza B virus infections9,10. Despite this, vaccine effectiveness is variable from season to season ranging from 34 to 76%9. As a result, our group developed more broadly-reactive influenza B HA antigens using a layered consensus approach termed computationally optimized broadly reactive antigen (COBRA), as previously described for the generation of influenza A antigens11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23.Others have demonstrated cross-lineage protection through stalk-directed antibodies. Chimeric HA (cHA) proteins, made with an IBV stalk and the head of exotic IAVs, were used in sequential vaccinations with different HA heads in order to induce stalk-reactive antibodies24. Mice were protected from lethal challenge against B/YAM and B/VIC viruses, but the mechanism of protection was through non-neutralizing antibodies that engage Fc-mediated effector functions. This method was expanded upon through a “mosaic” HA (mHA) approach in which instead of replacing the entire head domain of IBV with one from IAV, site-directed replacements with sequences from exotic HAs were introduced at the major antigenic sites in the head domain25. The B mHA vaccinations were able to prevent mortality in mice and reduce morbidity, but like the cHA vaccinations, the afforded protection was through non-neutralizing antibodies. While these platforms certainly have merit, the reliance on non-neutralizing antibodies that do not prevent infection can be a limitation for use in humans, especially in vulnerable populations where simply ameliorating disease may not be enough. And currently, a reliable correlate of protection for non-neutralizing antibodies in humans has yet to be established.The COBRA IBV (B-COBRA) HA vaccines elicited protective antibodies against viruses from both lineages. Moreover, these B-COBRA HA vaccines were more effective than wild-type HA in a pre-immune animal model. Immunological imprinting can greatly dictate immune responses to future influenza A viruses26, but it is unclear how IBV imprinting affects future immune responses to IBV strains. In this report, we explored how the breath of pre-existing immune responses elicited by infection of influenza B viruses could shape subsequent vaccine-induced antibodies.ResultsCross-reactive antibodies elicited by influenza B virusesIn an effort to better understand how anti-IBV derived antibodies reacted against other influenza B strains, a ferret antibody landscape experiment was conducted. 14 influenza B strains representing a time period from 1940 to 2017 were used to infect ferrets and, 30 days later, collected sera was tested for hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) activity against a panel of influenza B viruses (Table 1). Nine different B/YAM viruses that were used to infect ferrets elicited antibodies with high HAI activity against all B/YAM strains in the panel, but little-to-no HAI activity against B/VIC strains. Ferrets infected with B/VIC viruses had antibodies with high HAI activity against all the B/VIC strains in the panel. In addition, ferrets infected with the 3 older viruses (B/HK/01, B/MY/04, and B/BR/08) had seroprotective HAI titers (≥ 1:40) against B/YAM strains. These same 3 B/VIC viruses elicited HAI activity against B/Lee/40, as did the older strains of B/YAM (isolated from 1988 to 1999). Ferret sera collected from B/Lee/40 infected ferrets had a high HAI titer (1:5120) against the B/Lee/40 virus, but low HAI activity against the B/YAM viruses in the panel and little-to-no HAI activity against the B/VIC strains.Table 1 14 groups of ferrets (n = 2/group) were infected with different viruses spanning the IBV history in order to generate ferret reference sera.Full size tableCharacterization of IBV HA vaccinesThree initial hemagglutinin amino acid sequences were designed and characterized as vaccine candidates. HA sequences from 318 influenza B viruses isolated from 1940 to 2011 were aligned and the most common amino acid at each residue was determined resulting in an HA consensus sequence named BC1 (Fig. 1A). The same 318 IBV HA sequences were aligned using the multi-layered COBRA methodology and termed BC2. Another layered consensus alignment using 217 IBV HA amino acid sequences isolated from 1999 to 2011 was used to generate BC3. Phylogenetically, BC1 falls within the Yamagata-lineage, whereas BC2 and BC3 are aligned within or near the Victoria-lineage (Fig. 1B). For sequence alignments of these along with vaccine strains for IBV from 1940 to 2021, see Supplementary Fig. S1.Figure 1B-COBRA HA antigens for the vaccination and infection of pre-immune ferrets. (A) Publicly available HA sequences from 1940 to 2011 were downloaded and used to design three unique influenza B HA antigens: BC1, a single consensus sequence of 318 sequences during this period; BC2, the same 318 sequences antigenically layered into 10 secondary sequences and then a final consensus sequence; BC3, 217 sequences from 1999 to 2011 layered into 5 secondary sequences and then a final consensus sequence.

(C) Three plasmids containing genes for HA, NA, or a Gag viral matrix protein were lipotransfected into mammalian 293T cells. After 3–5 days, supernatants were collected, centrifuged, filter-sterilized, and then ultracentrifuged with a 20% glycerol cushion. Pellets were resuspended in a small volume of PBS, and then HA activity and protein concentration were determined. (D) Immunologically naïve ferrets were infected intranasally (day 0) with a B/YAM (SH/02) or B/VIC (HK/01) virus and then vaccinated intramuscularly once (day 90) with one of three B-COBRA VLP vaccines (BC1, BC2, BC3), one of four VLP vaccines expressing wild-type HA proteins from the B/VIC lineage (MY/04 or CO/17) or B/YAM lineage (FL/06 or PH/13), or a mock vaccination containing PBS and adjuvant. All vaccines were adjuvanted 1:1 with a squalene-based emulsion adjuvant. Blood was collected from all animals at days 0, 90, and 120. All ferrets were challenged with an IBV heterologous to their pre-immune infection and nasal washes were collected 3 days post-infection. Created with BioRender.com.Full size imageImmunological memory was established by infecting one set of ferrets with a B/YAM virus (B/SH/02) and a second set with a B/VIC virus (B/HK/01) prior to vaccination (Fig. 1D). These pre-immune ferrets were then vaccinated with virus-like particles (VLP) that were generated via lipotransfection into a mammalian cell line (Fig. 1C). The VLP vaccines consisted of one of the B-COBRA HA candidates or a wild-type HA from circulating influenza B viruses included in past commercial vaccines (Fig. 1D). Serum samples collected at day 90 (day of vaccination) following pre-immune infections, as well as sera collected at day 120 (~ 4 weeks post-vaccination), were tested for serological activity.Influenza virus infection is initiated by viral HA binding to sialic acid receptors on the surface of host cells, and as such, anti-HA antibodies to block this initial binding is the best course of action in preventing viral infection27,28. The HAI assay mimicks this by measuring the highest dilution of anti-HA antibodies from serum that prevents hemagglutination from influenza virus binding to red blood cells29. In this study, we utilize the HAI assay to assess the functional activity of ferret antisera against a panel of 5 Yamagata-lineage viruses isolated from 1988 to 2013 and 5 Victoria-lineage viruses isolated from 1987 to 2019.Antisera from B/YAM (B/SH/02) infected ferrets that were vaccinated with VLP vaccines expressing wild-type B/YAM HA antigens derived from B/FL/06 or B/PH/13 (Fig. 2A,B) had > twofold increase in HAI activity on average against all 5 B/YAM strains following vaccination. These titers ranged between 1:80–1:320 prior to vaccination and 1:320–1:1280 post-vaccination. Little-to-no HAI activity against the B/VIC panel was observed. These same antigens used to vaccinate ferrets that were previously infected with B/VIC (B/HK/01) (Fig. 2C,D) elicited antibodies with high HAI titers against the entire panel. Sera with HAI activity against the B/YAM strains increased > eightfold from a titer of ~ 1:40 prior to vaccination. HAI titers to the B/VIC strains increased two- to fourfold from a pre-vaccination titer of ~ 1:160.Figure 2HAI serum antibody titers induced by wild-type B/YAM vaccinations. Immunologically naive ferrets were infected with a B/YAM virus, SH/02 (top), or with a B/VIC virus, HK/01 (bottom) and then vaccinated once 90 days later. Serum was collected at day 90 following preimmunization (Pre-Vax) and day 120 (Post-Vax). HAI titers were assessed against five B/YAM viruses (yellow) and five B/VIC viruses (purple). Values are the log2 HAI titers of each individual ferret (n = 4) from antisera collected at the two timepoints. Dotted lines indicate a 1:40 to 1:80 HAI titer range.

These vaccinations in B/YAM pre-immune ferrets elicited lower HAI activity against B/VIC viruses (Fig. 3A,B). B/VIC pre-immune ferrets vaccinated with B/MY/04 had seroprotective antibody titers against all viruses in the panel, albeit they were not statistically significant (Fig. 3C). In contrast, B/VIC pre-immune ferrets vaccinated with B/CO/17 had higher HAI responses (~ fivefold increase) (Fig. 3D).Figure 3HAI serum antibody titers induced by wild-type B/VIC vaccinations. Immunologically naive ferrets were infected with a B/YAM virus, SH/02 (top), or with a B/VIC virus, HK/01 (bottom) and then vaccinated once 90 days later.

B/YAM pre-immune ferrets (Fig. 4B) had high HAI activity (~ 1:160) prior to vaccination against the B/YAM viruses and little-to-no HAI activity against the B/VIC viruses. Post-vaccination titers were boosted on average > sixfold (~ 1:1280) against the B/YAM viruses and 15-fold (~ 1:160) against the B/VIC viruses. B/VIC pre-immune ferrets (Fig. 4E) had HAI titers (~ 1:40) against the B/YAM viruses prior to vaccination and higher HAI activity (~ 1:320) against the B/VIC viruses. Post-vaccination titers for these ferrets were boosted sevenfold (~ 1:160) against the B/YAM viruses and tenfold (~ 1:2560) against the B/VIC panel of viruses. Similar HAI titers, albeit lower, were detected in BC3-vaccinated ferrets. No significant increases in HAI activity were observed against the B/YAM viruses in the B/YAM pre-immune ferrets, although all HAI titers exceeded seroprotective levels (Fig. 4C). The B/VIC pre-immune ferrets vaccinated with BC3 only had three ferrets in the group, thus reducing the significance scoring (a fourth point matching the others would have a p-value ≤ 0.01 against all viruses) (Fig. 4F).Figure 4HAI serum antibody titers induced by B-COBRA HA vaccinations. Immunologically naive ferrets were infected with a B/YAM virus, SH/02 (top), or with a B/VIC virus, HK/01 (bottom) and then vaccinated once 90 days later.

B/YAM pre-immune ferrets vaccinated with VLPs expressing BC1 HA (Fig. 4A) had on average a > fivefold increase in HAI activity against the B/YAM strains following vaccination with HAI titers ranging ~ 1:160 prior to vaccination and 1:1280–1:2560 post-vaccination. Sera collected from these same ferrets had little-to-no HAI activity against the B/VIC viruses. The same antigens used in B/VIC pre-immune ferrets (Fig. 4D) elicited antibodies with high HAI titers against the entire panel of B/YAM strains with an increase of > 20-fold from a titer of ~ 1:40 prior to vaccination. These same ferrets had a five to eightfold increase in HAI titers against the B/VIC strains from a titer of ~ 1:160 prior to vaccination.Neutralization of influenza B virusesWhile the HAI assay is still regarded as the “gold standard” for determining vaccine efficacy, microneutralization (MN) assays are often preferred amongst researchers since they are generally less subjective and can also capture other neutralizing antibodies that HAI does not, such as anti-stalk or NA-inhibiting antibodies30. Because the majority of neutralizing antibodies are anti-HA, however, MN and HAI generally correlate fairly well31,32, particularly when plaque reduction neutralization (PRNT) or focus reduction assay (FRA) are used which include ELISA as a readout33,34. In this study, we use FRA to evaluate the ability of serum antibodies to neutralize live virus infection for B/YAM (B/SH/02) pre-immunized ferrets (Fig. 5) and B/VIC (B/HK/01) pre-immunized ferrets (Fig. 6).Figure 5FRA neutralizing titers for Yamagata pre-immune ferrets vaccinated a single time with VLPs expressing different HA proteins: BC1, BC2, BC3, MY/04, FL/06, PH/13, CO/17, or Mock. Serum was collected at day 90 pre-vaccination (A–D) and day 120 post-vaccination (E–H) and tested against four IBVs: two from the Yamagata-lineage (A,B,E,F) and two from the Victoria-lineage (C,D,G,H). The dotted lines in the line graphs represent 50% inhibition and 80% inhibition of viral infection by antisera compared to virus-only control wells.Full size imageFigure 6FRA neutralizing titers for Victoria pre-immune ferrets vaccinated a single time with VLPs expressing different HA proteins: BC1, BC2, BC3, MY/04, FL/06, PH/13, CO/17, or Mock. Serum was collected at day 90 pre-vaccination (A–D) and day 120 post-vaccination (E–H) and tested against four IBVs: two from the Yamagata-lineage (A,B,E,F) and two from the Victoria-lineage (C,D,G,H). The dotted lines in the line graphs represent 50% inhibition and 80% inhibition of viral infection by antisera compared to virus-only control wells.Full size imageFerrets infected with B/SH/02 virus had neutralizing antibodies against the two B/YAM viruses tested (Fig. 5A,B) with an FRA50 log2 titer > 6.8, but had no neutralizing antibodies against the two B/VIC viruses (Fig. 5C,D). VLP vaccinations boosted antibodies against the B/YAM viruses (Fig. 5E,F) to an FRA50 log2 titer ~ 10.0 for most vaccination groups. Ferrets vaccinated with either of the three B-COBRA HA candidates or the two older wild-type HA proteins (B/MY/04 and B/FL/06) had antisera that neutralized B/BR/08 infection (Fig. 5G). Only ferrets vaccinated with BC2, BC3, or B/MY/04 HA-expressing VLP vaccines were able to elicit neutralizing antibodies against B/CO/17 (Fig. 5H). For both B/VIC viruses, the highest vaccine-induced fold-change occurred in ferrets vaccinated with BC2 or B/MY/04 VLPs. For the B/YAM viruses, the highest vaccine-induced fold-change occurred in ferrets vaccinated with BC1 and BC2.Ferrets pre-immunized with B/VIC (B/HK/01) had high neutralizing antibody titers against B/VIC viruses prior to vaccination (Fig. 6C,D) as well as cross-lineage neutralizing antibodies to B/MA/12 (Fig. 6A), but not to B/PH/13 (Fig. 6B). Ferrets vaccinated with BC1 HA VLPs or the B/YAM wild-type HA VLPs had the highest vaccine-induced increase in antibodies following the boost against the B/YAM viruses, with an FRA50 log2 titer of 7.83–10.26 to B/MA/12 (Fig. 6E) and 7.69–8.18 to B/PH/13 (Fig. 6F). Ferrets vaccinated with BC2 or BC3 HA VLPs had an FRA50 log2 titer of 7.39–7.86 against B/MA/12 and 5.74–6.77 against B/PH/13, whereas the B/VIC wild-type VLP vaccinated ferrets had titers of 5.82–6.85 against B/MA/12 and 5.66–5.97 against B/PH/13. All vaccinated ferrets had high post-vaccination titers (FRA50 log2 titer > 10) against the B/VIC viruses (Fig. 6G,H), with the highest titers recorded in ferrets vaccinated with BC2 or BC3 VLP vaccines.Heterologous challenge of pre-immune ferretsAll ferrets were challenged 30 days post-vaccination with a contemporary IBV from the B/VIC lineage (B/CO/17) or B/YAM lineage (B/PH/13) that were heterologous to the pre-immune infection virus (Fig. 7). Neither virus caused severe disease or death. The B/YAM pre-immune ferrets, as well as mock vaccinated ferrets, lost ~ 5% of their original body weight by day 5 following B/CO/17 challenge (Fig. 7A), which was slightly less than naïve, non-vaccinated ferrets (~ 7% average). All vaccinated ferrets had little weight loss and no signs of influenza virus infection over the time of observation. Comparable results were observed in B/VIC pre-immune ferrets that were challenged with B/PH/13 virus (Fig. 7B). Overall, all ferrets were protected against the influenza B virus challenge. Ferrets vaccinated with BC2 and BC3 HA antigens had less weight loss, on average, between the two different challenges and even gained weight over the period of observation (Fig. 7B). Little-to-no detectable viral titers were observed in nasal washes collected three days post-infection (data not shown).Figure 7Average percent original weight of ferrets (n = 4 per group) following challenge with B/Colorado/06/2017-VIC (left) or B/Phuket/3073/2013-YAM (right). With exception to the naïve (non pre-immune and non-vaccinated) group of ferrets shown for comparison, all ferrets were previously infected with IBVs from lineages heterologous to the challenge strain (B/Shanghai/361/2002-YAM or B/Hong Kong/330/2001-VIC). Following these infections to establish pre-immunity, ferrets were allowed to sit for 90 days and then vaccinated a single time with VLPs expressing different HA proteins. Challenges were performed 30 days post-vaccination. Ferrets were monitored for weights and clinical symptoms daily, and nasal washes were collected 3 days post-infection.Full size imageDiscussionImmunological imprinting or original antigenic sin following initial exposure to influenza has been well documented since it was first described in 196026. This concept, however, has been less well described for influenza B virus infection, especially in regard to cross-lineage boosting or negative immunological interference. Using our pre-immune IBV ferret model, we further elucidate the impact of IBV induced pre-immunity on vaccine-induced antibody responses. Pre-immunization with a B/VIC virus led to an induction of low levels of cross-reactive antibodies and enabled B/YAM HA vaccinated ferrets to generate seroprotective antisera against B/VIC viruses. The same cross-reactivity was less apparent for B/VIC HA vaccinated ferrets pre-immunized to B/YAM, but some ferrets still generated seroprotective antibody levels. In homologously matched pre-immunization and vaccination regimens, ferrets receiving a B/YAM HA vaccination mounted a low response to B/VIC viruses. Ferrets vaccinated with the B/YAM-like BC1 HA vaccine elicited slightly higher titers than the wild-type B/YAM HA vaccinated ferrets, though the increases were not determined to be statistically significant. In contrast, almost all B/VIC pre-immune ferrets that were vaccinated with B/VIC HA had seroprotective titers to B/YAM viruses. B-COBRA HA vaccinations however elicited more broadly-reactive antibodies in these B/VIC pre-immunized ferrets. Following vaccination, all ferrets had seroprotective antibody titers against all IBVs in the panel and BC2 and BC3 vaccines efficiently elicited high titer antibodies in B/YAM pre-immune ferrets. All BC2 HA vaccinated ferrets had statistically significant increases in HAI titers against the full panel of IBVs and only one ferret in the BC3 group failed to mount a seroprotective HAI response to the B/VIC panel. Ferrets vaccinated with VLPs expressing wild-type vaccinations preferentially boosted antibody titers against lineage-matched viruses and generally did not have seroprotective titers, particularly for ferrets vaccinated with antigens heterologous to the pre-immunity. Both BC2 and BC3 HA vaccines elicited antibodies with broader HAI activity against a panel of IBVs than wild-type HA vaccine comparators.Determining how initial exposure to one strain of influenza B virus impacts subsequent responses to future strains may be a key factor to consider when testing next-generation influenza vaccines, especially in children who may only have been exposed to an IBV strain from one lineage prior to vaccination. Other studies for example have shown that children vaccinated with a trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) containing a B/YAM antigen elicited cross-reactive antibody responses against B/VIC viruses if they were previously immunized to B/VIC, but not if they were unexposed35. Data on B/VIC vaccinations in children with no pre-existing immunity to IBV is scarce, however children vaccinated with B/VIC based vaccines were shown to have low immune responses to B/VIC antigens when these children were primed with B/YAM the previous season36. Children immunized with vaccines containing B/VIC the following year had high anti-HA antibody titers to B/VIC, as well as cross-lineage back-boosting to the B/YAM HA antigens36.Learning from imprinting is important—especially in regard to creating vaccines capable of “learning” from imprinting. More research is currently underway to better understand cellular mechanisms following vaccinations with COBRA HA, but we hypothesize that the inclusion of broader shared epitopes in antigen design leads to the recall of a broader B cell repertoire and increased breath of antibody response. For now, we show that B-COBRA HA vaccines were able to elicit serum antibodies in ferrets that had broader HAI activity and higher levels of neutralization against a panel of IBVs than wild-type comparators. Moreover, these broadly reactive influenza B antigens have the potential to replace the need for including both lineages in seasonal influenza vaccines, as well as better protection against future cross-lineage reassortments. That may not seem as relevant following the emergence of COVID-19, since no viruses in the B/YAM lineage have been detected since 202037,38,39. It is possible that the lineage has become extinct, but it is too early to say for certain, especially since lineage-specific sequencing of IBV is not widely performed and PCR resources have been prioritized for SARS-CoV-2. It is also possible that Yamagata-like viruses could reappear as H1N1 did in 197738. This would not be surprising given the extensive inter-lineage reassortment between the B/VIC and B/YAM lineages, and the regional specific and contained nature of IBVs. So having a broadly reactive antigen capable of neutralizing both lineages would be beneficial in preventing future reintroduction. An increased focus towards B/VIC epitopes may be warranted, but this may naturally occur for future B-COBRA HAs given that the COBRA methodology allows the natural evolution of influenza viruses to dictate the antigen design process20. These B-COBRA HA antigens utilized strains prior to 2012, and yet they were able to produce seroprotective titers against the future strains, often to similar levels as the matched modern wild-type HAs, and to higher levels when averaging the results from both pre-immune backgrounds. Therefore, these B-COBRA antigens have enormous potential at protecting against future drifted strains and will only be improved as next-generation COBRA HA antigens are developed that include more modern sequences.Additional studies are also being conducted looking at glycosylation differences. Currently, most seasonal influenza vaccines are derived from propagating viruses in embryonated eggs. This, however, can result in egg adaptations that can cause reduced vaccine effectiveness due to changes in receptor binding40. For IBV, there is a potential glycosylation site in HA1 positions 197–199, located in a critical receptor binding region, where egg adaptations occur that eliminate this potential glycosylation41. Infections in people with IBVs isolated with this glycan have increased morbidity compared to infections with egg-adapted viruses without this glycan at this site41,42. Cell-derived viruses are more similar to naturally occurring viruses that humans encounter and therefore cell-derived vaccine antigens may be more effective at eliciting antibodies that neutralize influenza virus infections42,43,44,45,46. All the B-COBRA HA proteins retain this glycosylation site, as well as the B/PH/13 and B/CO/17 HA VLP vaccines used in this study, but the B/MY/04 and B/FL/06 HA VLPs do not. Moreover, all the viruses used for infections and serological analysis in this study were propagated in eggs and lacked this potential glycosylation. Since B-COBRA HA antigens were designed utilizing sequences from both IBV lineages, their final sequences included potential N-glycosylations present in both B/YAM and B/VIC strains. Another potential N-glycosylation site occurs in the 160-loop (HA1 162–167) located in a region that protrudes outward at the top of the HA47. As a result of insertions, this site is shifted by two amino acids for B/YAM viruses isolated after 2002. It was retained in B/VIC viruses, but in 2017, a series of amino acid deletions accumulated just before in HA1 162–16448. This deletion event led to vaccine strain changes for the B/VIC component, moving to a B/Colorado/06/2017-like strain (2-aa deletion) and then to a B/Washington/02/2019-like strain (3-aa deletion)48. Since these B-COBRA HA antigens were designed with sequences spanning until 2011, these deletions were not captured. Additional studies could determine the contribution of HA sequences with these amino acid deletions incorporated into future B-COBRA HA antigens, but the expectation would be improved protection against B/VIC viruses with a potential reduction in coverage to B/YAM viruses.The advantages of our layering approach utilized with the COBRA methodology can be observed by comparing the BC1 and BC2 vaccinations. Both sequences were created with the same 318 HA sequences from IBVs isolated from 1940 to 2011. However, BC2, a product derived from employing our true approach to developing computationally optimized broadly reactive antigens, demonstrated remarkably better results. More work to assess the potential of these B-COBRA antigens needs to be completed, and current work is underway to help understand the mechanism on a cellular level. Regardless, these B-COBRA HA antigens and the COBRA methodology are certainly promising for improving seasonal influenza vaccine efficacy.Materials and methodsFerretsFemale fitch ferrets (Mustela putorius furo, 6–12 months of age, spayed and de-scented), negative for antibodies to circulating influenza B viruses, were purchased from Triple F Farms (Sayre, PA). Ferrets were pair-housed in stainless steel cages containing Sani-Chips laboratory animal bedding (P. J. Murphy Forest Products, Montville, NJ) and provided with Teklad Global Ferret Diet (Harlan Teklad, Madison, WI) and freshwater ad libitum. The University of Georgia Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) approved all experiments (A2021 06-016-Y3-A8) which were carried out at University of Georgia Animal Resources facilities in compliance with the ARRIVE guidelines. All methods were carried out in accordance with all relevant guidelines and regulations, including the National Research Council’s Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, The Animal Welfare Act, and the CDC/NIH’s Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories guide.Generation of ferret reference serum for IBV landscapeFerrets (n = 2/group) were anesthetized using 3–5% vaporized isoflurane (Piramal Critical Care, Inc., Bethlehem, PA) and intranasally infected (~ 500 μLostril) with one of 14 influenza B viruses (104–107 PFU/mL) spanning the history of influenza B from 1940 to 2017. Animals were monitored daily during the infection for adverse events, including weight loss, loss of activity, nasal discharge, sneezing, and diarrhea. Two weeks later, ferrets were immunized subcutaneously above the footpad with 250 μL of concentrated virus. And then after another two weeks, blood was collected in serum separator tubes (SSTs) and antiserum was separated out and aliquoted into new tubes for use as reference material.Vaccine preparationMammalian 293T cells were transfected as previously described with three plasmids each containing genes in a mammalian-optimized expression vector: (1) an HA gene encoding IBV wild-type or COBRA-derived sequences, (2) a mismatched NA gene (A/mallard/Alberta/24/2001 H7N3), and (3) an unrelated viral matrix protein, HIV-1 Gag p55. After 96 h of incubation at 37 °C with 5% CO2, supernatants from transiently transfected cells were collected, centrifuged to remove any cellular debris, and then passed through a 0.22-μm filter. VLPs were then ultracentrifuged with a 20% glycerol cushion at 135,000 x g for 4 h at 4 °C and then resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Hemagglutination activity was confirmed for each VLP by serially diluting each in a 96-well V-bottom plate and then incubating for 30 min at room temperature with an equal volume of 0.8% turkey red blood cells (tRBCs). Total protein concentration was assessed by a conventional bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA).Viral infection and VLP vaccination of ferretsFerrets (n = 4/group) were anesthetized using 3–5% vaporized isoflurane (Piramal Critical Care, Inc., Bethlehem, PA) and then intranasally infected (~ 106 PFU/mL with ~ 500 μLostril) with either an influenza B virus representing the Victoria lineage, B/Hong Kong/330/2001 (B/HK/01), or an influenza B virus representing the Yamagata lineage, B/Shanghai/361/2002 (B/SH/02). Animals were monitored daily during the infection for adverse events, including weight loss, loss of activity, nasal discharge, sneezing, and diarrhea. Ferrets were allowed to recover for 90 days and then, while anesthetized, bled and vaccinated once (250 μL) intramuscularly with VLP (7.5 μg HA) formulated 1:1 with an emulsified squalene-in-water AF03 adjuvant (Sanofi Pasteur, Lyon, France). 30 days later, ferrets were again anesthetized and bled, but then subsequently challenged (~ 108 PFU/mL with ~ 500 μLostril) with modern IBVs heterologous to their initial pre-immune infection, either the Yamagata-like B/Phuket/3073/2013 (B/PH/13) or the Victoria-like B/Colorado/06/2017 (B/CO/17). Nasal washes were collected 3 days post-infection. Blood was collected in serum separator tubes (SSTs) at days 0, 90 (pre-vaccination), and 120 (D30 post-vaccination). Serum was separated, transferred to new tubes, and stored at 4 °C for use right away or frozen at − 20 °C for long-term storage.Viruses and HA antigensInfluenza viruses were obtained through the Influenza Reagents Resource (IRR), BEI Resources, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), or were provided by Sanofi Pasteur and Virapur, LLC (San Diego, CA, USA). Viruses were passaged once in 10-day-old embryonated, specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chicken eggs per the protocol provided by the World Health Organization49. IBVs of the Victoria-lineage included the following strains: B/Hong Kong/330/2001 (B/HK/01), B/Malaysia/2506/2004 (B/MY/04), B/Brisbane/60/2008 (B/BR/08), B/Colorado/06/2017 (B/CO/17), and B/Washington/2/2019 (B/WA/19). IBVs of the Yamagata-lineage included the following strains: B/Yamagata/16/1988 (B/YM/88), B/Harbin/7/1994 (B/Har/94), B/Sichuan/379/1999 (B/Sic/99), B/Shanghai/361/2002 (B/SH/02), B/Florida/4/2006 (B/FL/06), B/Wisconsin/01/2010 (B/WI/10), B/Texas/06/2011 (B/TX/11), B/Massachusetts/02/2012 (B/MA/12), and B/Phuket/3073/2013 (B/PH/13). The first isolated IBV, B/Lee/1940 (Lee/40), was also included. All viruses were sequenced, and the HA sequences can be found in Supplementary Fig. S1.Hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) assayThe HAI assay was used to assess functional antibodies to the HA that can inhibit agglutination of turkey erythrocytes. The protocols were adapted from the WHO Laboratory Influenza Surveillance Manual49. To inactivate non-specific inhibitors, sera were treated with a receptor-destroying enzyme (RDE) (Denka Seiken, Co., Japan) prior to being tested. Briefly, three parts of RDE were added to one part of sera and incubated overnight at 37 °C. RDE was inactivated by incubation at 56 °C for 30–45 min and then cooled to room temperature before diluting with 0.01 M PBS (pH 7.2; Gibco) to a final sera concentration of 1:10. RDE-treated sera were serially diluted in PBS two-fold across 96-well V-bottom microtiter plates. An equal volume (25 μl) of ether-treated influenza B virus50, adjusted beforehand via hemagglutination (HA) assay to a concentration of 8 hemagglutination units (HAU)/50 μl, was added to each well. The plates were covered and incubated at room temperature for 20 min, and then 0.8% turkey erythrocytes (Lampire Biologicals, Pipersville, PA, USA) in PBS were added. Red blood cells (RBCs) were prepared fresh each week, stored at 4 °C, and used within 72 h of preparation. The plates were mixed by agitation and covered, and the RBCs settled for 30 min at room temperature. The HAI titer was determined by the reciprocal dilution of the last well that contained non-agglutinated RBCs. Positive and negative serum controls were included for each plate. Seroprotection was defined as an HAI titer ≥ 1:40, seronegative with a titer less than 1:40, and seroconversion as a fourfold increase in titer compared to baseline resulting in a titer of ≥ 1:4051.Focal-reduction assay (FRA)The FRA was initially developed by the WHO Collaborating Centre in London, modified by the CDC (Thomas Rowe, unpublished data), and previously described52. Briefly, MDCK-SIAT1 cells (250–300,000 cells/mL at 95–100% confluency) were added to 96-well F-bottom plates (100 μL/well) and incubated overnight at 37 °C with 5% CO2. The following day, cell monolayers were rinsed with 1 × PBS, and then RDE-treated serum was added (50 μL/well). Serum was serially diluted two-fold in virus growth medium with 1 μg/mL TPCK-trypsin (VGM-T) from a 1:20 starting dilution. Wild-type, non-treated virus (previously titrated and standardized to 600 FFU/50 μL) was then added (50 μL/well). Column 11 without sera served as the virus control (VC) and column 12 without sera or virus served as the cell control (CC). Plates were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and then an overlay (modified Eagle medium with 0.1% BSA, 0.6% Avicel, 1μg/mL TPCK-Trypsin, and antibiotics) was added (100 μL/well). Plates were incubated for 18–22 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and then the overlay-virus mixtures were removed from each well. The cell monolayers were washed once with PBS and then fixed with ice-cold 4% formalin in PBS (100 μL/well) for 30 min at 4 °C. Plates were then washed twice with PBS and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS/glycine (100 μL/well) at room temperature for 25 min. The plates were washed three times with wash buffer (PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 or PBST) and then incubated for 1 h at RT with a monoclonal antibody (50 μL/well) against influenza B nucleoprotein (IRR, FR-52) diluted 1:2000 in ELISA buffer (PBS with 10% horse serum and 0.1% Tween 80). The plates were washed three times with PBST and then incubated 1 h at RT with goat anti-mouse peroxidase-labeled IgG (KPL, 474–1802) diluted 1:2000 in ELISA buffer. The plates were washed three times with PBST and then a TrueBlue substrate (SeraCare) containing 0.03% H2O2 was added (50 μL/well) for 10 min at RT. The colorimetric reaction was stopped by washing the plates with distilled water. Plates were dried well, and then infectious foci (spots) were visualized and counted using a BioSpot analyzer with ImmunoCapture 6.4.87 software (CTL, Shaker Heights, OH). The FRA titer was reported as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of serum corresponding to 50% focus reduction compared to the VC minus the CC, so long as the VC is 200–1600 spots, and the CC is less than 21 spots.Statistical analysisStatistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism software. For HAI, paired nonparametric t tests were performed to determine the significance of vaccine-induced antibodies between timepoints against each strain for each pre-immune background. Additionally, 2way ANOVA analyses were performed to determine the significance between each vaccination group (data not shown). P values of ≤ 0.05 were considered significant. Data availability The datasets generated and/or analyzed during the current study are available in the NIAID/NIH CIVICs C3 website repository for review and download: https://www.niaidcivics.org/. In addition, HAI raw data available in Supplementary File S1. Values transformed to Log(2) in Prism for Figs. 1, 2 and 3. FRA results showing the average number of foci per vaccination group at each dilution divided by the average number of foci for the virus control, used to make Figs. 5 and 6, available in Supplementary File S2. Supplementary File S3 shows the FRA titer at 50% and 80% inhibition, calculated by finding the titer dilution at the point where each curve passes, or the estimated point if dilutions are higher than 12.32. Raw data from imager exports for individual ferrets available upon request. Weights in grams and percent original weight for individual ferrets shown in Supplementary File S4. Vaccination group averages and standard deviation used for Fig. 7 also shown. HA sequences for VLPs and egg-grown viruses shown in Supplementary File S5. ReferencesFrancis, T.

Via Nova Therapeutics Sep 21, 2023, 16:05 ET Share this article Share toX Share this article Share toX OAKLAND, Calif., Sept. 21, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Via Nova Therapeutics, Inc., a biotechnology company focused on discovering and developing therapeutics to treat viral infections with significant unmet medical need, today announced the clearance of its Investigational New Drug (IND) application from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for its Influenza A nucleoprotein inhibitor, VNT-101. "We look forward to evaluating VNT-101 in the clinic," said Don Ganem MD, Co-Founder and CEO of Via Nova Therapeutics. "This is an important step to developing a flu antiviral with a novel mechanism of action, and a milestone for Via Nova Therapeutics as we advance our first compound into the clinic." About the VNT-101 program VNT-101 is a novel investigational small molecule being developed for treatment of seasonal influenza A infection. It is directed against a novel target, the influenza A nucleoprotein (NP). VNT-101 has demonstrated activity in vitro against seasonal influenza A and highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 and H7N9 strains. Due to VNT-101's novel mechanism of action, it has also demonstrated activity in vitro against influenza A strains harboring resistance mutations to currently available influenza therapeutics. About Via Nova Therapeutics Via Nova's mission is to discover and develop safe and effective new therapies for viral diseases for which current treatments are lacking or inadequate. Founded in August of 2021 with the in-licensing of antiviral programs from Novartis, Via Nova Therapeutics' programs target influenza A virus, human rhinovirus, BK polyomavirus, and adenovirus.

By Thomas Hughes | Bay City News • Published September 19, 2023 • Updated on September 19, 2023 at 3:13 pm Getty Images Sonoma County's health officer issued an order Tuesday for health care workers who work directly with patients to wear face masks during an anticipated surge in the transmission of respiratory viruses this fall and winter. The order lasts from Nov. 1 to April 30 and covers workers in facilities such as hospitals, clinics, and other facilities where patient care is provided indoors. Watch NBC Bay Area News 📺 Streaming free 24/7 "Each year we see that higher rates of influenza, COVID-19 and other respiratory viruses that can cause severe respiratory infections occur annually between late fall and spring," said Dr. Karen Smith, Sonoma County's health officer. "Patients and residents in our health care and congregate facilities, especially young children, pregnant women, the elderly, and those with chronic health conditions, are at greater risk for respiratory virus-related hospitalizations and death. Workers in direct care, health care, and congregate facilities are at risk for respiratory illness and can transmit the viruses to their clients, patients, and coworkers," Smith said. news Sep 12, 2023 Covid-19, flu, RSV: Here are the vaccine recommendations for fall—and the best time to get them Congress Sep 18, 2023 Millions of parents to face child care dilemma if federal assistance ends this month Smith also strongly recommended that everyone who is at least 6 months old get an updated COVID-19 vaccine and a flu shot. The recommendation included guidance for the public to wear face masks in indoor public settings when COVID-19 or influenza transmission rates in the county are high. Last fall, hospitalizations for influenza in Sonoma County outpaced COVID-19 hospitalizations for the first time since the pandemic began. Hospitalizations peaked for influenza on Dec. 1 at 69 people, four of whom were in intensive care units, according to county data. On that day, there were 43 people hospitalized with COVID-19 and two people with both. The most COVID-19 hospitalizations last fall and winter peaked on Jan. 3 of this year at 61 people. For comparison, there were more than 100 people hospitalized with COVID-19 during surges in January 2021 and January 2022 and practically zero hospitalizations from influenza at that time.

Washington State Department of Health What became widely known as Washington state's Covid dashboard over three pandemic years, has now received an upgrade. The dashboard now includes information on Covid, influenza, and and RSV. The new dashboard went live Monday, showing data on viral activity, hospitalizations, ER visits, and deaths from each virus. It will be updated weekly through April 2024, covering the peak season for all three viruses. RELATED: What will Washington's virus season look like in 2023? As of the publishing of this blog post, viral activity remains low, however, there is an uptick in Covid cases (which began in August). That Covid spike is still much lower than previous spikes during pandemic years. With Covid added to the seasonal viruses, the word "tripledemic" has been thrown around, implying that three viruses will have spikes around the same time. Such spikes could strain hospital systems. As KUOW recently reported, state Secretary of Health Dr. Umair Shah has noted that, “Concerns remain that an increase in cases from all, or one, of these respiratory viruses will lead to challenges in our communities and our health-care system, We want people to take the precautions now because that's going to help our health-care system.” An updated Covid vaccine is rolling out this month. A flu vaccine is recommended for people six months and older, while an RSV vaccine is recommended for infants and people ages 60 and older.

Photo: CanvaKnock-on effects from the global avian flu crisis are beginning to have significant effects on multinational poultry companies as they struggle to meet demand.It is estimated that the avian flu outbreak has results in the loss of 40 million birds and is associated with economic costs ranging from US$2.5 billion to US$3 billion, according to a new investor report from FAIRR.Mass culling of birds around the world is exacerbating global food price inflations and products, including eggs and chicken ready meals, but there are also material implications for protein producers and companies across the food supply chain with share pieces of some of the world’s largest producer companies being affected.As an example, Tyson Foods has been struggling to meet consumer demand for poultry, resulting in an operating income loss of US$258 million, although this has been exacerbated by staffing issues in processing plants.Bird flu infections and implicationsThe study, ‘Industry Reinfected – Spotlight on the Economic and Public Health Impacts of Avian Flu’, has been produced with the University of Surrey and provides a summary for both policymakers and investors on the avian flue crisis. It looks at the rise in infections globally, the financial and economic implications for the food sector and the potential impact on trade and the global economy and implications.Importantly, it also provides an analysis of emerging policy recommendations, highlighting the importance of taking a One Health approach to address the disease risk.ALSO READ: Real-world HPAI vaccination trial underway The Dutch government, together with Wageningen University & Research, Utrecht University and Royal GD, have started their first real-world avian influenza vaccination trial. Read more…As part of this report, the analysis from the University of Surrey found that the stocking density in intensive commercial poultry farming in the UK may provide environmental conditions that facilitate viral transmission, affecting animal welfare and health, as well as causing economic impacts.Conversely, free-range farming houses fewer chickens per square foot which allows for greater movement of individual birds.Movement and transmissionBy comparing 2 movement scenarios and 2 separate populations of birds, one with intensive conditions and the other in a free-range setting, the case study quantifies the impact that individual bird movement has on the transmission of avian flu. The study found that keeping birds in smaller flocks, where they have increased movement, results in fewer birds dying. This result could be particularly important for implementing disease control strategies, such as moving or quarantining healthy birds, and introducing vaccination intervention in a timely manner so that disease spread could be slowed.The analysis by FAIR shows that, despite improvements in recent years, amongst the different proteins, the poultry sector has been the worst performer on average over the last 4 years (2019-2022). The poultry sector has consistently performed poorly when compared to the average performance of other protein companies in the areas of waste and pollution and food safety metrics.Recommendations and adviceThe report includes some recommendations to investors:They should review the ESC and biosecurity risk in their investee companies’ protein supply chains.They should emerge with investee companies to understand their approach to avian flu and other emerging disease risks and encourage an uptick in performance factors such as animal welfare which are relevant to reduce the risks of disease.They can use their voice to impress on policymakers the need to enact policy changes for agricultural production to reduce the spread of disease and reduce risk drivers – this could include providing poultry with more space and ending close confinement.With the right incentives in place, investors and companies in the animal supply chain can potentially play a role in financing policy measures such as vaccines (e.g., financial resources or incentives are provided by policymakers to invest in vaccine schemes).Capacity building programmes will be needed across the supply chains of the largest protein companies to ensure a robust response to disease, such as investments in staff training on biosecurity, disease control and prevention.ALSO READ: Industry clash with welfare groups over new bird flu reportAdvice to policymakers includes:Health and finance ministers attending next year’s 77th World Health Assembly should, in recognition that prevention is often cheaper than response, enact not only shortterm disease control measures such as biosecurity measures in the sector, but also long-term prevention measures to address the drivers of disease.Policymakers should consider policy changes that may reduce the spread of diseases or reduce risk drivers, including providing poultry with more space and ending close confinement, as well as promoting smaller farm sizes. This will also reduce financial losses in the event of an outbreak. These changes could be written into trading standards and agreements.Policymakers can provide targeted financing, including R&D into vaccines and other disease control solutions, while also supporting farmers with the capital required to address additional disease control mechanisms.To reduce the impacts on wildlife and prevent spread of disease between wild birds and poultry, policymakers should consider preventing siting of commercial farms in areas that are populated by large numbers of wild birds such as wetlands.Capacity-building programmes are needed to ensure that disease response programmes are implemented based on sound technical knowledge at the farm level. This includes technical knowledge of the importance of biosecurity, hygiene, animal welfare and human occupational health standards.As many farmers are dependent on public support, policymakers can incentivise best practices to create a more resilient and sustainable food system that addresses emerging disease risk drivers through repurposing agricultural support programmes.Knowledge sharing will be required between stakeholders on best practices including the role of academic research.Consideration should also be given to novel approaches for resource mobilisation for risk reduction and prevention. These include insurance measures, solidarity funds, public-private partnerships for R&D, international cooperation and through accreditation schemes such as Red Tractor or RSPCA Assured.Join 31,000+ subscribers Subscribe to our newsletter to stay updated about all the need-to-know content in the poultry sector, three times a week.

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has released updated recommendations regarding influenza vaccination. According to a press release from the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP),1 health care professionals can choose from up to 9 different influenza vaccines for the upcoming 2023 to 2024 flu season.In estimates from the 2019 to 2020 flu season, the CDC stated influenza vaccines “averted 7 million illnesses, 3.4 million medical visits, 100,000 hospitalizations and 7100 deaths.”Among the newly-published recommendations, approved by the AAFP, one stand out is for patients with any history of an egg allergy, regardless of severity. These patients can receive any influenza vaccine, whether it is egg-based or non-egg-based, so long as it is otherwise appropriate for their age and health status. No additional safety measures, beyond measures recommended for any vaccine, are no longer called for.Annual, routine vaccination is recommended for those aged 6 months and older, who do not have contraindications to vaccination. Vaccination should focus on people at an increased risk for complications from severe influenza who have no contraindications, should supplies become limited.All influenza vaccines available in the United States for the 2023-2024 flu season are quadrivalent. Below are the vaccines and corresponding approved age ranges for each. Depending on patient age, Afluria Quadrivalent “is to be administered in different doses and methods.”Afluria Quadrivalent, Fluarix Quadrivalent, FluLaval Quadrivalent, Fluzone Quadrivalent and Flucelvax Quadrivalent: approved for those aged 6 months and olderFluMist Quadrivalent: approved for those aged 2 to 49 yearsFlublok Quadrivalent: approved for those aged 18 years and olderFluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent and Fluad Quadrivalent: approved for those aged 65 years and older.For children aged 6 months to 8 years who have not previously had 2 or more doses of trivalent or quadrivalent influenza vaccine 4 or more weeks apart, or for those whose vaccination status is unknown, 2 doses of influenza vaccine are required, given at least 4 weeks apart. It is recommended that these patients receive the first dose as soon as it becomes available. For children aged 8 years that need 2 doses, both doses should be administered “even if the child turns 9 before the second dose.”More details on these recommendations are available on the CDC website.2 This article originally appeared on Contemporary Pediatrics.References1.

The first three cases of avian influenza were detected in the Galapagos Islands. Share Avian Flu Hits Bird Paradise of Galapagos Islands share Print Quito, Ecuador — The Galapagos National Park said Tuesday that it had detected its first cases of avian flu on the remote islands, home to unique bird species that helped inspire the theory of evolution. Three positive cases of the H5N1 virus were detected after reports of visibly sick birds on the islands, the park said in a statement. The Galapagos archipelago is a bird-watchers paradise with scores of unique and colorful species, such as the blue-footed booby with its quirky mating rituals, and endemic penguins, cormorants and albatrosses. English naturalist Charles Darwin developed his theory of evolution after studying finches and mockingbirds on the Galapagos islands in 1835. The islands, 1,000 kilometers (621 miles) from Ecuador's coast, are home to "78 species of native and endemic birds," according to the environment ministry. Ecuadoran authorities said in December they had put in place a monitoring system on the Galapagos as a global bird flu outbreak reached South America. The H5N1 bird flu has typically been confined to seasonal outbreaks, but since 2021 cases have emerged year-round, and across the globe, leading to what experts say is the largest outbreak ever seen. There is no treatment for bird flu, which spreads naturally between wild birds and can also infect domestic poultry. Avian influenza viruses do not typically infect humans, although there have been rare cases, including that of a 9-year-old girl infected in Ecuador in January. The outbreak has infected several mammal species, such as farmed minks, cats and sea lions, and the World Health Organization warned in July this could help it adapt to infect humans more easily.

But a meme has been circulating with the false suggestion that those vaccines are ineffective. Actually, they’ve saved millions of lives and have eliminated both measles and rubella in the U.S. Full Story Public health experts around the world have hailed the widespread use of vaccines as one of the most important medical advances in the last century. “Vaccines are one of the greatest achievements of biomedical science and public health,” the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention wrote in 1999. “Immunization currently prevents 3.5-5 million deaths every year from diseases like tetanus, pertussis, influenza and measles,” the World Health Organization wrote in a recent roundup celebrating its 75th anniversary. “As diseases like polio and diphtheria fall out of living memory, people are increasingly vaccinated against diseases they have never seen, making it harder to understand how devastating they can be.” But while vaccines are responsible for saving millions of lives and preventing even more illnesses, public confidence in vaccination has begun to erode in recent years. During the COVID-19 pandemic, while overall support for vaccines remained high, public perception of the importance of vaccination for children fell in 52 of 55 countries studied by UNICEF. The U.S. was among the countries where it declined. Anti-vaccine advocates used the pandemic to amplify their message by targeting the new COVID-19 shots and gaining many followers. “Although anti-vaccine activism was already increasing in the USA and internationally, the 2020 emergence of COVID-19 served as an accelerant, helping turn a niche movement into a more powerful force,” according to a recent paper published in the Lancet. A meme circulating on social media (shown at right) illustrates how false claims about long-accepted vaccines have become entwined with the campaign against COVID-19 vaccines. The meme references flu shots and the combined vaccine to protect against measles, mumps and rubella, called MMR, both of which have been available for decades. It falsely suggests that those inoculations don’t work. Social media accounts that have shared the meme also include captions that say things like, “How long will we pretend the COVID vax works?” Another, similar meme focused on the flu shot claim has also been circulating. This is just the latest version of the well-worn falsehood that the continued spread of COVID-19 proves that the vaccines don’t work. We’ve explained before why that’s wrong. As new variants of COVID-19 emerged, the vaccines became less effective in preventing symptomatic infection, but they are still highly effective in preventing severe disease and death. This new meme deploys the same deceptive tactic to cast doubt on two other, unrelated vaccines. We’ll address the effectiveness of each vaccine below. Flu Vaccine Flu shots were first developed with help from the U.S. Army in the early 1940s and were approved for use in 1945. Those early shots were effective against only a couple of strains of the influenza virus, though. There are four types of influenza — called A, B, C and D — and the two that are mostly likely to affect humans, A and B, can be broken down into more specific subtypes and lineages. In order to monitor which of those strains were most prevalent at a given time, the WHO started the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System in 1952. The GISRS continues that work today in 127 countries, making it easier to target specific strains each year. “There is often more than one type of influenza virus circulating each season,” the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has explained on its website. “So, vaccines are formulated to target four of the most likely influenza viruses to circulate and cause illness in the U.S. during the upcoming influenza season: two influenza A types (H1N1 and H3N2) and two types of influenza B. These are known as quadrivalent vaccines. Influenza B more commonly affects children and also causes more complications and death in children than adults.” So, flu vaccines have improved since they were first introduced, and the number of people getting them has increased over time. According to CDC data, the number of doses administered in the U.S. has risen markedly over the last four decades. In the 1980-1981 flu season, the earliest for which there is data, 12.4 million people were vaccinated. In the 2020-2021 flu season, which was in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, a record high 194.4 million people were vaccinated. That high dropped slightly in the following two flu seasons, to 175.6 million in 2021-2022 and 173.4 million in 2022-2023. Since the 2010-2011 flu season, the CDC estimates that vaccination has prevented nearly 5,500 deaths each season on average, as we’ve explained before, excluding the 2020-2021 flu season since measures adopted to slow the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19 led to far fewer cases of the flu. So, the flu vaccine clearly works. However, the meme suggests that flu vaccines aren’t effective because they haven’t eradicated influenza after nearly 80 years and there’s still a need for annual vaccinations. But that reasoning is flawed for a couple of reasons. First, not all vaccines are the same. Some require only a primary series to be effective for life (such as the hepatitis B vaccine) and others require new dosages regularly (such as the flu vaccine). This is because the viruses they’re designed to address behave differently. Long-lasting vaccines typically target viruses that replicate uniformly, Dr. Linda Yancey, an infectious disease expert at the Memorial Hermann Health System in Houston, explained in a post for the hospital. “They replicate very faithfully, so if you have hepatitis B, every hepatitis B virus in your body looks identical,” she said. “The same with measles. They are very good at replicating themselves without error, and that is a huge benefit for us, because it means that once you get antibodies against one hepatitis B or measles virus, you have immunity against every hepatitis B or measles virus you are ever going to encounter.” By contrast, the influenza virus shifts frequently. “The reason we have to get the flu shot every year is that the influenza virus is able to shuffle its chromosomes around in a way that most viruses cannot,” Yancey said. “This actually happens on a very regular basis, and that’s why, every year, we have to come up with a new flu vaccine depending on the strains currently circulating,” she said. Scientists are working to develop a universal vaccine for the flu, which would be effective against a broad spectrum of strains, Dr. Anthony Komaroff, a professor at Harvard Medical School, explained in an April post. It would work by targeting a common element shared by most flu strains that’s buried deeper in the structure of the cell instead of targeting structures on the outer layer, as is the case now. The same thing that necessitates a different formulation for the vaccine each year — the wide variety of strains and their ability to quickly mutate — is also the reason that influenza hasn’t been eradicated. “[E]ven if we could vaccinate everyone around the world, we would not be able to eradicate influenza,” the American Museum of Natural History explained about the elimination of diseases. “There are many different strains of influenza virus, and they mutate frequently — so new vaccines must constantly be created to keep up. There’s another problem as well: some animals can become infected with different strains of influenza, and these can spread to people and other mammals. Avian flu comes from birds, and swine flu from pigs. Unless we can figure out how to inoculate all birds and pigs, we’ll never be able to stop transmission of the infection.” And as the CDC has explained, “At least two factors play an important role in determining the likelihood that vaccination will protect a person from flu illness: 1) characteristics of the person being vaccinated (such as their age and health), and 2) how well the vaccines ‘match’ the flu viruses spreading in the community. When flu vaccines are not well matched to some viruses spreading in the community, vaccination may provide little or no protection against illness caused by those viruses.” MMR Vaccine Measles was eliminated in the U.S. in 2000 due to widespread vaccination in the preceding decades. Rubella was eliminated four years later. While mumps hasn’t yet been eliminated in the U.S., there’s been a 99% reduction in cases since the first mumps vaccine became available in 1967. Those three vaccines were combined into the common childhood shot called MMR in 1971, which was 52 years ago. Since the meme refers to a vaccine that’s been available for 60 years, it’s probably talking about the first measles vaccine, which was licensed for use in 1963. So, we’ll focus on the impact of vaccination against measles. As we said, measles has been eliminated in the U.S., which means that the disease hasn’t spread for a year or more in a specific area. However, unvaccinated travelers may bring it into the U.S. and cause isolated outbreaks in communities with other unvaccinated people. “By the end of 2021, 76 (39%) countries had been verified by independent regional commissions as having achieved or maintained measles elimination status,” according to the CDC. The WHO has estimated that measles vaccination has prevented 56 million deaths worldwide between 2000 and 2021. Although the U.S. has maintained its measles elimination status, there have been some outbreaks in recent years. As we wrote about one such case in 2019, travelers had brought the virus into the country and the disease then spread in communities that have unvaccinated people, according to the CDC. The CDC issued a statement that April identifying misinformation about the safety of vaccines as a “significant factor” contributing to the outbreak. Similarly, the executive director of UNICEF and the director-general of the WHO issued a joint statement calling measles “the canary in the coalmine of vaccine preventable illnesses.” They, too, cited online misinformation about vaccine safety as a contributing factor in the rising number of measles cases in high- and middle-income countries. Similarly, an Ohio outbreak in late 2022 was concentrated among unvaccinated patients. “This outbreak was characterized by young median patient age, low rates of MMR vaccination, and high rates of respiratory coinfection, with twice the hospitalization rate reported among previous measles cases in the United States,” according to a CDC report on the incident. “This outbreak serves as a reminder that health care facilities, medical providers, and child care facilities serving undervaccinated populations should maintain vigilance for measles and emphasize the importance of timely MMR vaccination. Sustaining elimination of measles in the United States will require continued high 2-dose MMR vaccination coverage in all communities.” So, the suggestion that the MMR vaccine hasn’t been effective is easily disproved.

With migratory bird season coming to a close, state and federal officials are reporting that the number of bird flu cases, particularly the highly pathogenic kind, are continuing to trend downwards, though they’re still waiting to test some samples.It took about three months to get test results back from the migratory bird that was found dead in Western Alaska on Thursday, May 25. Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge scientists suspected the dead cackling goose to be the first casualty caused by the highly pathogenic avian influenza. But State Veterinarian Dr. Robert Gerlach said that the goose didn’t test positive for bird flu.“Yeah, that was a negative for the high pathogen influenza. I don't believe that it even had a low pathogen strain there,” Gerlach said.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), avian influenza viruses are found among bird populations worldwide and spread via inhalation, ingestion of infected secretions, and through contact with contaminated material from infected birds. Avian influenza virus strains are classified according to the severity of illness they cause in domestic poultry. Low pathogenic avian influenza typically causes few or no symptoms in poultry, while highly pathogenic avian influenza can cause severe illness and death. Avian influenza viruses rarely infect humans, according to the CDC.Gerlach said that flu testing for wild birds takes time. There can be a delay in reporting the results from a bird that was found or sampled in remote parts of Alaska. If a sample or the entire bird is collected, it is first shipped to a state lab in Anchorage. They have to thaw it out and then process it.“Once we get a sample or if we receive a swab sample from the remote area of the state, we send it down to a laboratory in Washington state or the Washington State Animal Diagnostic Laboratory. It takes them generally two days to go ahead and receive the sample, and then process it and tell us whether it's a avian influenza infection that's going on,” Gerlach said.Generally that lab doesn’t identify which strain of the influenza it is, so the sample must be sent to another lab.“They then forward that down to the [United States Department of Agriculture] office or laboratory in Ames, Iowa for further testing. That's the laboratory that goes ahead and then will give us whether there's a high pathogen strain,” Gerlach said. “Then we'll work on the genetic strain of the virus to identify whether it's a North American strain, or whether it's a new introduction, or whether it's a there's any changes or mutations that are going on in the virus.”But it’s a faster process for domestic birds. Gerlach credits this to the better ability to control the domestic bird population. Once scientists identify high pathogen influenza, they need to move quickly to quarantine the flock and kill the birds.“As soon as we identify it's a positive for high pathogen avian influenza, then we go in and depopulate the flock to prevent that from spreading to other birds or to wild birds. And so we have a much higher priority to go ahead and process those samples,” Gerlach said.Recently, a glaucous gull did come back positive, making it the first confirmed positive case in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta. Gerlach also said that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service found some dead murres from a mortality event in the Bethel census area. That agency confirmed 20 positive cases from dead common murres on Sept 15.“A large number of birds died, and we've identified an influenza virus, and we sure don't know what that virus is yet. I'm making an assumption that it's more than likely going to be a high pathogen influenza virus, but we'll go ahead and hopefully find out because oftentimes, as we see, we've had other mortality events occur across the state. Large number of birds die, they send them into us,” Gerlach said.But this shouldn’t be alarming. Overall, Gerlach said that they saw a decreasing number of cases this year. According to a State of Alaska Epidemiology Bulletin, in 2022 there were 123 positive cases from the 850 samples submitted to the state lab. That is just 14% of the samples tested from both wild and domestic birds from across the state.Currently, Gerlach said that the most prevalent strain of the highly pathogenic virus in North America is known as H5N1. And, although H5N1 primarily affects birds, in Alaska it has been detected in a brown bear in Kodiak, a black bear in Glacier Bay National Park, and three red foxes: one in Nome, one in the Matanuska-Susitna Valley, and one in the Aleutians.

September 18, 2023. (photo credit: Ecuador's Galapagos National Park/Handout via Reuters) Three birds on the Galapagos Islands have been found to be infected with H5N1 avian influenza, according to preliminary information published by the Galapagos National Park Directorate.The Galapagos Islands, an archipelago located hundreds of kilometers off the coast of Ecuador, are known for their large number of diverse and unusual endemic species, including finches and cormorants, which helped Charles Darwin develop his theory of evolution in the 1830s.According to the national park directorate, a number of dead birds have been spotted around the islands, with five birds collected for sampling. Of the five, three have tested positive for H5N1 bird flu in preliminary tests, although the samples were sent to the National Institute for Research in Public Health (INSPI) for further testing. The National Environmental Authority on the archipelago has activated biosafety protocols in order to fight the spread of the virus, including closing visiting sites where infected birds have been found.Tour operators were also instructed to intensify the disinfection of footwear and clothing when arriving at and leaving from each site. The authorities are continuing to monitor the habitats of birds on the islands in order to evaluate the situation.

We have mobilized all our resources and experts to implement measures that reduce the impact on this unique ecosystem. However, we are issuing an urgent call to the public: if you find sick or dead birds, do not touch them or pick them up," said Ecuador's Environment Minister José Antonio Dávalos.Avian influenza outbreaks continue to spread across the globeThe cases in Ecuador were reported as outbreaks of H5N1 avian influenza continues to affect birds and mammals in the Americas and Europe. The outbreaks began in 2021 and have continued since without significant breaks, in contrast to the seasonal pattern of outbreaks in the past. The spread of the virus in the past few years has been described as "the largest-ever" outbreak on all three continents. The outbreak, as well as other strains of the virus, has also spread to other locations around the globe.South Africa has been dealing with an outbreak of the H7N6 strain of the virus, with millions of chickens killed by the outbreak.Sign up for the Health & Wellness newsletter >> Related Tags Virus Ecuador wildlife bird flu Hot Opinion Change the climate: Israel’s environmental potential at COP29 and regional impact By JPOST EDITORIAL To recover, Democrats must expel anti-Zionist extremists who put off Middle America By AMOTZ ASA-EL Leaders of the Jewish enemies have always died as weak cowards By URI PILICHOWSKI How will the recent US election affect Iran, Russia, and North Korea?

That’s good news for all of us, says Christian Sandrock, M.D., a pulmonary, critical care, and infectious disease physician at UC Davis Medical Center in Sacramento, California. “Getting a flu shot reduces the likelihood of severe disease and complications of severe disease, but also reduces the burden of the flu in the family and community. It is rare that you will have a bad outcome,” Sandrock tells Runner’s World. Complications from the flu vaccine are uncommon, and fortunately for runners, exercising after the vaccine is beneficial, according to Sandrock and 2022 research published in the Journal of Brain, Behavior, and Immunity. Here, experts explain why it’s important to get a flu shot and how exercising afterward helps both your mood and its efficacy. Related StoryResearch Supports Running Post VaxWhy Runners, in Particular, Benefit from the Flu Shot“The flu is a virus, and it can be severe for certain groups of people, like young people, old people, and those with chronic medical conditions,” explains Joshua Scott, M.D., a primary care sports medicine physician at Cedars-Sinai Kerlan-Jobe Institute in Los Angeles and a medical consultant to USA Track and Field. Marathoners also need to be aware of the risks of contracting the illness, as athletes in particular face their own unique risks. “Runners are at risk for getting the flu if their immune system is worn down with excessive training,” says Cindy Starke, M.D., an internal medicine doctor at Northeast Georgia Medical Center in Gainesville, Georgia. Also, getting the flu is a surefire way to knock your training off track. “The flu will completely inhibit your ability to train—it can lead to nausea and vomiting, extreme muscle aches, sensitive skin, and fever,” she says. “No one can train if they are actively infected with the flu.” Because the flu is a viral infection, you can’t knock it out with antibiotics, adds Scott. You can take over-the-counter meds to help mitigate some of the symptoms, but most bouts of the flu last one to two weeks. The more missed workouts that rack up, the more likely it is to affect your overall training and your readiness to race. That’s why getting the flu shot is so important for runners as it can help you sidestep the illness and make symptoms more manageable.Related StoryAre Your Symptoms Coronavirus, Flu, or Allergies?Let Go of Vaccine Myths In Order to Keep Running Believing that a vaccine will make you sick stops some runners from getting the shot, but that’s a myth. “The influenza vaccine that is injected is an inactivated virus,” explains David Weldy, M.D., Ph.D., a family and sports medicine associate professor at The University of Toledo. That means it isn’t possible to get the flu from the vaccine.Some people do feel bad after getting the shot, but that’s just because their immune system is mounting an immune response to the pieces in the vaccine—not because they have the flu, adds Starke. “The most common side effects of the vaccine are redness, soreness, and/or swelling at the side of the injection,” says Weldy. “However, there can also be a mild systemic response of low-grade fever, headache, and muscle aches beginning soon after the shot and lasting one to two days.” Considering the flu can last one to two weeks, one to two days with mild discomfort doesn’t seem so bad. Related StoryCan You Break a Fever?Timing the Flu Shot With Other VaccinesOne common concern people have is whether they should get the flu shot along with the new COVID-19 vaccine and, possibly, the respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV vaccine, as well. That’s a lot of shots, and the number itself concerns people. To figure out what’s right for you, it’s always smart to talk to your doctor about the vaccines you plan to receive.“There is clear data that people should get the flu shot and the COVID vaccine at the same time,” says Sandrock, who does this himself. The benefits of this are mostly convenience. The two shots should be in separate locations if you prefer, but you can also get them in the same arm, two inches apart. If you plan to get both vaccines, and you prefer not to get them at the same visit, that’s also okay. Some research suggests that getting the two shots together can increase symptoms, like fatigue, headaches, or muscle aches, but this can also depend on the individual.Finally, the CDC recommends that adults over 60 talk to their physician about the RSV vaccine, as it is not recommended for everyone, says Sandrock. “The ACIP, an advisory body to the CDC, gave the RSV vaccine a lukewarm recommendation,” he explains. “This means that rather than a blanket recommendation, which we have for something like the measles vaccine, they want you to talk to your doctor to review the risk/benefit.” Sandrock adds that if your doctors think it is right for you, then the timing would be similar to the flu shot and COVID-19 vaccine, as you should get it in the fall, though it should be administered on a separate day.Related StoryWhat to Know About Running With a FeverHow Exercise Can Help You After Getting a VaccineOnce you’ve decided to get the flu shot, the COVID vaccine, or both, you might wonder how you should time it with your training and race schedule. On that front, there is some good news.Research suggests you might want to get some light exercise after the vaccine administration, says Sandrock. “There are two reasons. First, increased blood flow may improve the response to the vaccine. Second: your mental health. You always feel better,” he says. The COVID-19 vaccine works a little differently, he says, so if you get both shots at once, feel free to take walks, but don’t be surprised if you need to hold off on running for a couple of days afterward.This also means you don’t want to get the shot the day before a big race or workout. “If you get the shot one to two weeks before an event, all side effects should be resolved by race day,” adds Weldy.Related StoryReturn to Running Slowly if You’ve Had COVIDWith or Without Vaccines, Be Vigilant Against Viruses“Runners train for months, sometimes, for one race, and they cannot take the chance of getting their training interrupted by a viral infection,” says Starke. Whether you do or don’t decide to get the flu shot, there are a few other things you can do to stay healthy throughout flu season and beyond. “Washing your hands with soap frequently and before meals or while at the gym, for example, is helpful to prevent transmission of the virus on anything from a doorknob to a set of dumbbells,” says Scott.“Eating healthy foods and getting enough sleep improves the immune system and lessens the chance of transmission if you do come into contact with the [flu] virus,” Scott adds. “Runners should also eat plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables to help build their immune system and keep it functioning at an optimum rate,” says Starke.

By Pranjal Malewar 21 Sep, 2023 2 min readFollow us on Credit: Freepik Fever is a common symptom of influenza and COVID-19, yet its physiological role in host resistance to viral infection remains less clear. Increased susceptibility to influenza virus infection in older humans could be explained by the fact that older human monocytes have impaired signaling to induce type I interferons (IFNs) in response to influenza virus infection. However, the role of other age-related changes of host factors in susceptibility to influenza virus infection remains unclear. Moreover, elderly individuals also have lower mean body temperatures. A team of researchers from The University of Tokyo conducted a study to discover the gap between body temperature and infection resistance by drawing inspiration from these clinical observations. According to research, a higher body temperature inhibits the replication of viruses and overactive inflammatory reactions. Through this study, scientists bridged the gap by linking higher body temperature with an increased infection-fighting capability of the gut microorganisms or “microbiota.” The scientists exposed mice to 4°C, 22°C, or 36°C for a week before inoculating with the influenza virus for their tests. High-heat-exposed mice raise their basal body temperature above 38°C, allowing them to produce more bile acids in a gut microbiota-dependent manner. On the other hand, the majority of the cold-exposed mice died from severe hypothermia after the viral infection was induced. To boost host resistance to influenza virus infection, the scientists hypothesized that deoxycholic acid (DCA) signaling from the gut microbiota and its plasma membrane-bound receptor “Takeda G-protein-coupled receptor 5” (TGR5) was necessary. This was done by inhibiting viral reproduction and neutrophil-dependent tissue damage. The team conducting these tests discovered that mice infected with the influenza virus had lower body temperatures nearly four days after the infection started and huddled up to stay warm. After replacing the influenza virus with SARS-CoV-2, the scientists observed comparable results, and the study’s findings were further confirmed using a Syrian hamster model. According to their studies, body temperatures over 38°C may boost a host’s resistance to influenza and SARS-CoV-2 infections. Additionally, they discovered that such an elevation in body temperature accelerated critical gut microbial processes, which later produced secondary bile acids. These acids can modulate the immune system, protecting the host from viral infections. Dr.Takeshi Ichinohe from the Division of Viral Infection at the University of Tokyo, Japan, said, “The DCA and its nuclear farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonist protect Syrian hamsters from lethal SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, certain bile acids are reduced in the plasma of COVID-19 patients who develop moderate I/II disease compared with the minor severity of illness group.” The scientists then thoroughly analyzed the mechanisms underlying the host resistance to viral infections mediated by gut metabolites in heat-exposed animals. They also confirmed the function of bile acid receptors and secondary bile acids in preventing viral infections. “Our finding that reduction of certain bile acids in the plasma of patients with moderate I/II COVID-19 may provide insight into the variability in clinical disease manifestation in humans and enable approaches for mitigating COVID-19 outcomes.” To put it briefly, the presented study shows that the high-body-temperature-dependent activation of gut microbiota increases the blood and intestinal levels of bile acids.

"Some people are saying, 'Well, could I get RSV, COVID and the flu vaccine on the same day?' Yes, indeed, you could. But honestly, I might not," said Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. Instead, he said he intended to get the COVID shot right away and the flu shot in early October. Marks, who was speaking during a recent call with FDA stakeholders, stressed that he did not disagree with guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention which allows giving multiple different routine shots during the same visit. Doctors refer to this as "coadministration" or "simultaneous administration" of vaccines.However, he acknowledged that getting up to three of the different vaccines at the same time could lead to more side effects — like stronger fatigue or a small fever — in the days after getting the shots. Spacing out the shots by around two weeks could "minimize the chance of interactions, and minimize confusing side effects from one with another," he said. They might be a good option for people who did not mind multiple trips to the pharmacy or their doctor's office."I might just want to space them out a little bit. But if you had to drive a lot of miles to get the vaccines, then it might not be unreasonable to get all three of them at once," said Marks.Getting an updated COVID-19 vaccine nowOf the currently available options, Marks said that his plan was to get a dose of the updated COVID-19 vaccine first.Health authorities have been fortunate to have a vaccine that appears likely to work well for protecting against the currently circulating strains of the virus, he said. "It's like having a bird in the hand. I have a bird in the hand, good match, a lot of COVID around, great time to go get vaccinated," said Marks. The FDA had selected the strain to target in the current batch of shots back in June, clearing the way for vaccine makers to ramp up their production ahead of a fall rollout. Marks cited recent data suggesting that these updated vaccines, which have been revised from previous designs to now target the XBB.1.5 strain of the virus, would also work to boost protection against its closely-related descendants now dominant nationwide.Early results shared by the vaccine makers with a CDC panel earlier this month also suggests that these updated shots will also work against the highly mutated BA.2.86 variant, which has been reported in a growing number of states. Free COVID test kits are coming back. Here's how to get them.Do COVID-19 tests still work after they expire? Here's how to tell.Several leading COVID trends, like emergency department visits, have started to slow in recent weeks following a summer wave that began to accelerate last month. Another "moderate" wave is predicted to begin over the coming colder months, the CDC's disease forecasters say, with that surge's peak expected to arrive potentially earlier than it did last season.Marks said it was possible that health authorities might allow for another dose to be offered to some vulnerable groups later in the fall and winter. "I think if we saw that it appeared that people might benefit in a few months from an additional dose, we would probably work with our CDC colleagues to issue a recommendation at that time. But right now we are just talking about a single recommendation, a single dose," he said. Scheduling a flu shot for early OctoberBy early next month, Marks said he plans to have received his flu shot. "I usually get my influenza vaccine around October 1st," Marks said. This is later than some other health officials within the Biden administration. CDC Director Dr. Mandy Cohen posted on social media on Sept. 6 to say she had gotten vaccinated for the flu.Similar to previous seasons, CDC's official recommendations for this year are that "[flu] vaccination should ideally be offered during September or October." Marks said that the boost in protection offered by flu vaccines can wane, underscoring why the shots should not be given too early in the season, before the threat of infections ramps up. Flu season in the U.S. typically peaks between December and February, but can stretch into the spring.The protection from a flu shot "has a little bit of a shorter life than we might like, in some ways it's a little like the COVID vaccines," Marks said.Right now, weekly CDC data suggests flu activity remains at low levels in most parts of the country. New options for RSVSome Americans also have new options to be immunized for RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, for the first time this year. Older adults, ages 60 and older, can get a dose of the new vaccines developed by Pfizer or GSK. The CDC recommends that shots be offered "as early as vaccine supply becomes available" this year.CDC data suggests RSV infections have begun to accelerate in some parts of the country, with the steepest rises in the Southeast. A panel of CDC advisers on Friday recommended that Pfizer's new RSV vaccine should be given during pregnancy as well, in hopes of passing on protection to newborns during their most vulnerable early months of life. The panel recommended that pregnant people take one dose of the vaccine between weeks 32 and 36 of pregnancy. A new antibody injection from Sanofi and AstraZeneca is also available for babies this year, which is recommended to be given to infants born ahead of this coming RSV season.

EIN Presswire | Newsmatics TrippBio Announces Clearance of Investigational New Drug Application for PanCytoVir™ Treatment of Influenza News provided by EIN Presswire Sep 21, 2023, 7:05 AM ET TrippBio, Inc. • First study will evaluate the pharmacokinetics of a novel oral PanCytoVir™ suspension We look forward to generating data with our new formulation and advancing another option for the treatment of influenza disease.”— Dr. David E. MartinJACKSONVILLE, FL, UNITED STATES, September 21, 2023/EINPresswire.com/ -- TrippBio, Inc. (TrippBio), a clinical development-stage biopharmaceutical company developing antiviral treatments, announces that it has received clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the Investigational New Drug (IND) application for the use of PanCytoVir™ Suspension (100mg/mL) as a treatment of acute, uncomplicated influenza disease. Clinical studies to evaluate the effect of PanCytoVir™ in patients with acute, uncomplicated influenza disease can now commence with the first study scheduled to evaluate the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of the novel PanCytoVir™ suspension (NCT06025318). David E. Martin, PharmD, and CEO of TrippBio, Inc., stated, "We are pleased to announce that the FDA has cleared our IND for the use of our innovative oral dosage formulation, a PanCytoVir™ suspension. We look forward to initiating our second clinical program and advancing therapeutic options for the treatment of respiratory tract infections.” PanCytoVir™ PanCytoVir™, which is based on probenecid, is approved by the FDA for the treatment of the hyperuricemia associated with gout and can be used as an adjuvant to therapy with penicillin-derived antibiotics for prolonging drug plasma levels. PanCytoVir™ is a favorable antiviral drug candidate as it is commercially available and has high plasma concentrations with a benign clinical safety profile. It has demonstrated potent activity against SARS-CoV-2[1], influenza[2], and RSV[3] in vitro and in preclinical infection models. The antiviral activity of PanCytoVir™ against influenza is more potent, in vitro, than Tamiflu® against contemporary influenza A and B strains, H7N9 avian influenza A and H5N1, a highly pathogenic influenza A virus. The potency difference was also observed in vivo with both A and B strains. Recent data in patients with symptomatic, mild-to-moderate COVID-19 showed that PanCytoVir™ treatment significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 viral load, and significantly more treated patients had complete resolution of COVID-19-related symptoms by Day 10 versus placebo[4]. This is important as the antiviral mechanism of action against SARS-CoV-2 is shared with influenza, suggesting an increased probability of success in clinical studies. PanCytoVir™ was granted a US patent (#11,116,737) on 14 September 2021 for “Methods of Using Probenecid for Treatment of Coronavirus Infections” with additional international filings ongoing. A Phase 3 clinical trial for COVID-19 is currently being developed, and the clinical program for influenza is expected to start in 3Q2023, with planning underway for an IND filing for RSV soon. A novel oral suspension is being developed to enable flexible dosing across the different patient populations impacted by these three respiratory viruses with a single product. 1.

Most people who get sick recover quickly, but the elderly in particular are at a higher risk of severe complications or even death. An annual flu vaccination booster can help reduce the risk of infection. In the 10 EU countries, for which 2022 data is already available, vaccination rates among people aged 65 and older were high in Denmark (78%), Ireland (76%) und Sweden (70%). In Germany, the Standing Committee on Vaccination (STIKO) recommends annual vaccination against influenza for people aged 60 and over. In 2022, 43 % of this age group had been vaccinated. In some countries, the vaccination rate increased. Compared to 2021 the vaccination rate among the elderly increased from 75% to 78% in Denmark, from 60% to 70% in Sweden. In other countries the vaccination rate decreased. In Italy the vaccination rate among those aged 65 and over was 65% in 2021 and 58% in 2022. In Germany the proportion of those vaccinated fell from 47% to 43%. In most of the countries, however, the rate was higher than in 2019, the year before the outbreak of the Corona pandemic.

Two frigate birds and one red-footed booby were confirmed to have died from the virus on Tuesday, after samples were sent to Guayaquil on the Ecuadorian mainland for examination.Park guards and veterinarians are redoubling efforts to protect the islands’ 78 species of endemic and native birds, including flightless cormorants, the only species of penguin in the northern hemisphere and one of the largest albatross colonies in the world.The Galápagos Islands’ unique bird species were observed by Charles Darwin in 1835 when he visited the isolated archipelago on HMS Beagle and helped him set out his theory of evolution by natural selection in On the Origin of Species. They are considered particularly vulnerable due to their low immunity, small populations and the effect of rising ocean temperatures.Scientists say the virus was probably brought to the islands by migratory birds. Last year, Ecuador declared an emergency due to outbreaks of avian influenza on farms. In neighbouring Peru, the highly contagious virus ripped through seabird populations, killing as many as 200,000 as well as decimating marine mammals such as sea lions.View image in fullscreenNational park technicians examine birds on Genovesa Island. Photograph: Parque Nacional Galápagos/AFP/Getty ImagesThe Galápagos national park activated emergency health protocols on Sunday following the report of dozens of dead and sick birds on two islands, Wolf and Genovesa, in the northern part of the Pacific archipelago, which lies about 1,000km from the South American continent.Rueda said red-footed boobies were showing a “higher number of dead birds but also more symptoms [such as] erratic behaviour” characteristic of bird flu.Two visitor sites were closed on Española Island, the only place where the critically endangered waved albatross breeds, though there were no confirmed cases of the birds with the virus.“Our main worry is for the endemic species,” said Rueda. “Their populations are quite small and are restricted to the Galápagos.”“It is very worrying to find a dead bird or a bird that has given a positive result, so we have to triple the biosecurity efforts on tourist boats, for tourists and crew members,” he said.Gustavo Jiménez, principal investigator for the Charles Darwin Foundation, said many species including boobies, albatross and the endangered Galápagos penguin were facing scarcer food sources due to El Niño, and the resulting stress made them more susceptible to pathogens such as avian flu.“The endemic species are very sensitive to any disease,” he said. “Our best defence is prevention.”Scientists also fear that, as it has on the mainland, the virus could jump to endangered Galápagos sea lions and fur seals.A warning has been issued calling on tourists visiting the Unesco Natural Heritage of Humanity site not to try to touch affected birds. Avian influenza can be transmitted to humans.Federico Angermeyer, a tour operator in the archipelago, said the disease’s landfall could hurt tourism, the islands’ principal economic activity.“The impact of the [Covid-19] pandemic is not over and bird flu is going to be another big blow,” he said by phone.Explore more on these topicsGalápagos IslandsSeascape: the state of our oceansEcuadorAmericasBird fluBirdsAnimalsWildlifenewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveTax strategyFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInXNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Symptoms include fever, headaches, joint pains, and a sore throat. Most people recover in 1–2 weeks. According to the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, children are highly likely to catch the flu virus. It states that every year, around 20,000 children under 5 years old need hospital treatment for the complications flu can cause. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) adds that most people with flu do not need medical care. However, they recommend that people over 6 months old get the flu vaccination every year. This article explains how children may experience flu symptoms and lists the appropriate treatments. It also highlights signs to look out for that could indicate a child is developing flu complications.Flu symptoms in childrenShare on PinterestPeopleImages/Getty ImagesFlu symptoms in children may include:a sore throatchillsa coughjoint painsmuscle achesheadachesa runny or blocked nosefatigueloss of appetitevomiting and diarrheafeverChildren with flu may experience many of these symptoms, or just a few.

These include:a fever above 104ºFdifficulty breathing or very fast breathsseizureschest painthe ribs pulling in as the child breathesdehydration, especially if the child has not urinated for 8 hoursa lack of alertness or responsivenessworsening of any underlying conditions the child may haveweakness in the legsIt adds that parents or caregivers need to contact a doctor if an infant under 3 months old has any sort of fever.Learn about when a child’s fever is too high.Which children are most at risk from flu?While anyone can catch the flu, young children, particularly those under 2 years old, are at a higher risk of developing complications.Children under 5 years old may also experience more severe symptoms than older children and adults. Children with chronic health conditions Flu is a respiratory infection, meaning it may affect a person’s breathing. The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America explains that people who have asthma may find that the flu virus triggers their asthma symptoms.Children with neurological conditions may be more likely to develop complications if they catch the flu. This includes those with cerebral palsy and muscular dystrophy. For this reason, the CDC recommends calling a doctor immediately if a child with a neurological condition catches flu. The American Lung Association notes that children with the following conditions are also at increased risk of flu complications:heart diseasecystic fibrosisdiabetessevere anemia, including sickle cellChildren having chemotherapy face additional risks. Treating flu in children Most children recover from the flu by getting plenty of bed rest and staying hydrated. Doctors may prescribe antiviral medications if the child is very sick or has an underlying condition. These medications can shorten the duration of the infection and make the symptoms milder.Some simple home remedies can also relieve flu symptoms. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends using a nasal spray with saline solution or salty water. These sprays go directly into each nostril and help flush out the nasal passages to relieve congestion and dryness. For infants under 6 months old, caregivers can use saline solution with a rubber suction bulb.Children with flu may also find breathing easier if they use a humidifier. Humidifiers add moisture to the air, which can help clear a child’s nasal passageways.Those ages 2 years and over can take ibuprofen and acetaminophen for a fever, headache, or muscle and body aches. The AAP warns against giving children aspirin, as it has links with Reye’s syndrome, a rare condition affecting a person’s liver and brain.It is best for caregivers to talk with their child’s doctor if they are unsure which medication to give or the correct dose. If caregivers feel medication is still necessary for fever or pain relief after 3 days of symptoms, it is also important they speak with a doctor. The CDC recommends yearly vaccinations to help protect against the flu.Learn about the pros and cons of flu vaccination.How long does the flu last for children?According to the AAP, most children recover from a flu infection in about 1 week. However, they may take another week or so to regain their energy levels fully. Read more about how long the flu lasts.SummaryChildren with flu may experience nasal congestion, coughs, aches and pains, fever, and fatigue. These symptoms usually come on suddenly, leaving the child feeling unwell. Most children do not need medical attention for the flu and recover within a week. However, some children may develop breathing difficulties or become less responsive and need urgent medical care. Children with underlying conditions may develop complications from the flu virus. The infection may trigger symptoms of these other conditions. Doctors can treat severe flu infections with antivirals. Health experts recommend people over 6 months old get the flu vaccine.Flu / Cold / SARSInfectious Diseases / Bacteria / VirusesPediatrics / Children's HealthFluHow we reviewed this article:SourcesMedical News Today has strict sourcing guidelines and relies on peer-reviewed studies, academic research institutions, and medical journals and associations.

While the COVID-19 vaccine and the flu shot may be administered on the same day without issue, some experts warn that getting an RSV vaccine on the same day as the other injections could cause negative side effects. It’s time to start considering which vaccines you need to avoid cold-weather illness. New COVID-19 variants have emerged, causing a recent spike in cases and hospitalizations. Meanwhile, flu season is swiftly approaching. And RSV is top of mind thanks to a recent FDA approval for a new vaccine. With new developments in vaccine accessibility and technology, experts are hopeful that we might avoid another tripledemic heading into the winter months. Here’s what to expect for fall vaccine availability, recommendations, and how to choose the right vaccines for your family. Getty Images / mediaphotos The Flu Vaccine Changes Every Year, Just Like the Flu Each year, infectious disease experts monitor the flu virus across each season and hemisphere. In anticipation of the virus and season, different flu vaccine strains are selected to make up the vaccine that is available for the upcoming flu season. In the United States, flu season typically starts in the fall and peaks during the winter months. The flu vaccine, like other vaccines, is made from either a live, but very weak (attenuated) form of the virus, an inactivated (no longer live) form of the virus, or a synthetically grown dose of the part of the virus structure that the immune system attacks, Mark Loafman, MD, a practicing family medicine doctor in Chicago, told Health. “All three versions stimulate essentially the same immune response one would get if they had and recovered from influenza infection,” he explained, “and all three work very well, but live attenuated vaccines generally produce the strongest immune response and are preferred for those at higher risk of influenza complications.” Loafman recommends everyone six months and older get an annual flu vaccine. Children aged eight or younger who have not yet received any flu vaccine will need to receive two doses, but adults, and children who have received a flu vaccine at some point in their life just need one dose per flu season. People 65 and older can request a stronger dose of the flu vaccine which is tailored to offer them more protection for their weaker immune systems. It can take up to two weeks after injection for protection to begin. “The reason the vaccine is recommended for everyone is based on the high levels of infection,” said Loafman. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), an estimated 365 million flu-related illnesses occurred during the 2019–2020 flu season. From 2010–2020 the flu caused about 12,000–52,000 deaths annually. When Should You Get the Flu Vaccine? September or October is the ideal time to get your flu shot. Antibody levels start to rise about two weeks after vaccination, so an early fall vaccination date allows you to reach peak antibody levels by the time cases start to occur in significant numbers later in the year. For most people, protection from the flu lasts for roughly six to eight months, with antibody levels decreasing toward the end of that timeframe. “Effectiveness also depends on how well the vaccine, which is developed each year in anticipation of the flu virus strains expected in the fall, matches the actual strain of flu viruses that appear,” said Loafman. According to the CDC, general side effects from the flu vaccine are mild and generally only last a few days. These symptoms can include swelling or soreness at the injection site, a low-grade fever, nausea, muscle aches, or fatigue. “One important fact about side effects is that the flu shot does not cause the flu,” said Loafman. “However for it to be effective it must generate an immune response and, depending on how brisk that response is in a particular individual at that particular time, there can be minor side effect symptoms.” Where To Get Free Flu Shots Without Insurance New COVID-19 Boosters Are Approved Since the first Coronavirus vaccine became available in late 2020, pharmaceutical companies have worked to provide up-to-date, readily available vaccinations. As COVID-19 continues to mutate, boosters are available to provide protection from new variants. The latest booster is designed to target the XBB.1.5 omicron subvariant. While the strain is no longer dominant, the booster can still protect against its circulating sub-variants, which are closely related. Last week, the new booster received approval from the Food and Drug Administration, as well as a recommendation from the CDC. “It is likely to be available in one to two weeks,” Janak Patel, MD, director of the Department of Infection Control & Healthcare Epidemiology at the University of Texas Medical Branch, told Health. “However, many clinics and pharmacies may take additional days for procurement and internal distribution," he said. "So, practically, most people should have access through traditional channels by the end of September.” The CDC recommends that every six months and older receive the COVID-19 vaccine. The highest priority should be for those aged 65 years and older, and those with underlying high-risk health conditions. If you have already received your COVID-19 vaccine, you may be eligible for a booster. If you’re unsure if you qualify, it is best to consult with a doctor. When Should You Get the COVID-19 Vaccine? The CDC currently recommends that anyone over the age of six months old should get the COVID-19 vaccine if they have not already. Patel explained that researchers are still learning how long a COVID-19 vaccine provides protection from the illness. But, based on the percentage of U.S. adults who’ve been vaccinated and the percentage of U.S. adults who’ve had at least one COVID-19 infection, Patel estimates that “the annual vaccine strategy is likely to protect us for at least one year.” He noted that it is still possible that after a few months of the vaccine, the protection may begin to decline, but may be still sufficient for overall population protection for about a year. The COVID-19 vaccine has similar side effects to the flu vaccine. For adults, it can include pain, redness, and swelling at the injection site, fatigue, headache, chills, fever, and nausea. For infants side effects can include: pain in the leg or arm where the shot was given, swollen lymph nodes, irritability or crying, fatigue, or loss of appetite. “Studies have shown that the new upcoming booster formulations have a side effect profile that is similar to the previous versions of the same vaccine type,” explained Patel. “If persons are reluctant to get a dose of an mRNA vaccine due to previous intolerable side effects, a protein subunit vaccine from Novavax is a good alternative. It has a lower side effect profile and still offers decent protection against severe disease.” What Is Needle Fatigue? With all this talk about vaccines, you might find yourself suffering from what medical experts call ‘needle fatigue’. It can stem from a fear of needles or just the fatigue of getting shots. First RSV Vaccine Shows Promise While most people who contract RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, will experience mild symptoms, infants and older adults can have more severe circumstances. This is especially true if there are other health factors at play that may be already weakening the immune system. There is an RSV antibody vaccine available to high-risk babies; it requires monthly injections throughout the RSV season. A new RSV vaccine for infants—nirsevimab (Beyfortus)—became available in August 2023; it only requires one shot. In May 2023, the FDA approved the first RSV vaccine for adults—Arexvy. “This current vaccine uses a form of the F protein, preF, which RSV attaches to when it infects our bodies,” Preeti Parikh, MD, board-certified practicing pediatrician and executive medical director at GoodRx told Health. “In the vaccine, this protein is mixed with an adjuvant, which helps trigger an immune response,” she said. “After injection, our bodies will produce antibodies in response to what it perceives as a threat and it will remember what preF looks like so it can better fight it in the future. This way our bodies are already prepped to stop an infection if we do encounter the virus.” The nirsevimab vaccine is meant for newborns and infants up to 8 months of age who are about to face their first RSV seasons, as well as children eight to 19 months old who have high-risk conditions such as prematurity or cardiac condition, explained Parikh. “This is important because RSV is particularly dangerous for young children and this vaccine can add valuable protection and reduce hospitalizations,” she said. The Arexvy vaccine is designed for adults 60 and older, who have a heightened risk of developing a more severe infection. When Should You Get the RSV Vaccine? The CDC recommends for the 2023–2024 RSV season that anyone 60 years or older, with the recommendation of their healthcare provider, get the RSV vaccine if it is available to them. Parikh explained that the Beyfortus vaccine may last through one RSV season, which is roughly five to six months, while the Arexvy vaccine may give you protection for two seasons. The Beyfortus vaccine is typically well-tolerated among children, but, if your child is experiencing severe side effects like difficulty breathing or swelling in the face and throat, contact a healthcare provider immediately. “After receiving the Arexvy vaccine you may experience side effects like fatigue, headache, muscle aches, and joint pain,” Parikh said. “Side effects should subside after a few days but if they don’t, you should contact your doctor.” Getting the Flu, COVID-19, and RSV Vaccines at the Same Time The COVID-19 and flu vaccines may be given at the same time with no issues. However, Parikh says that there is mixed data that the RSV vaccine and flu vaccine together may decrease the effectiveness of the vaccines. Ultimately, it is best to speak with a healthcare provider and decide your own vaccination schedule, and whether or not you should get all three vaccinations on the same day. Was this page helpful?

Here's Why Experts are HopefulWritten by Meagan Drillinger — Fact checked by Jennifer Chesak, MSJ — Updated on September 22, 2023Share on PinterestA new report from the CDC finds that the flu vaccine was over 50% effective at preventing illness in the Southern Hemisphere. Jasmin Merdan/Getty ImagesA new report from the CDC finds that the flu shot was over 50% effective at preventing illness during the flu season in the Southern Hemisphere. The report sheds light on what might happen during the upcoming flu season in the U.S.The seasonal flu is linked to tens of thousands of deaths annually in the U.S.As fall begins in the Northern Hemisphere, winter in the Southern Hemisphere is winding down in preparation for spring.With these changing seasons also comes data about the upcoming flu season in the United States.The seasonal flu vaccine is tweaked yearly to target the circulating viral strains. Data from the flu vaccine in the Southern Hemisphere can shed light on what we can expect in the winter in the Northern Hemisphere. Early signs point to the flu vaccine preventing illness in the Southern Hemisphere with 52% effectiveness. This means the vaccine being produced for the upcoming flu season in the U.S. could be as effective. Flu vaccine reduces severe flu symptomsOfficials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that initial data from South America shows that the flu vaccine helped to decrease severe disease. The CDC states that “early, interim estimates, provided before the expected end of seasonal influenza virus circulation, suggest that vaccination substantially reduced the risk for severe influenza illnesses, underscoring the benefits of influenza vaccination.”Based on data from Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay on 2,780 severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) patients hospitalized from March 27 to July 9, 2023, the vaccine effectiveness associated with any influenza virus was 52%.“This suggests that if the same strains of the virus continue to circulate, we could see the vaccine providing similar benefits against severe disease and hospitalizations,” said Hannah Newman, MPH, senior director of infection prevention at Northwell Lenox Hill Hospital. “While I don’t have a crystal ball, the success of this year’s flu vaccine in South America makes me hopeful that we will have a similar experience in the United States.”Although flu season data from South America can be helpful indicator for North America, virus strains can also mutate slightly making the vaccine less effective during the U.S. winter season. What are the dangers of the flu?Each year, the CDC estimates the burden of influenza in the U.S. Between 2010 and 2020, it estimates that the flu has resulted in 9 to 41 million illnesses, 140,000 to 710,000 hospitalizations, and 12,000 to 52,000 deaths annually. Symptoms of the flu can range from mild to severe, including the onset of: feverdry coughheadachemuscle and joint painsore throatrunny noseHospitalizations and deaths occur mostly in high risk groups. People at higher risk, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), include: pregnant peoplevery young childrenolder adults individuals with chronic medical conditions (i.e., chronic cardiac, pulmonary, or kidney disease) people with suppressed immune systemsHealthcare workers are also at high risk of developing the disease, given the increased exposure to patients with influenza.How to protect yourself against the fluWhile there is no cure for the flu, it is possible to take measures to reduce the risk of exposure and lessen symptoms. Getting a flu vaccine is one of the best measures to help keep ourselves and those around us safe from severe illness.“Influenza severity and peak of season can be difficult to predict, and the best preparation is to get vaccinated annually,” said Newman. “The CDC typically recommends getting your flu shot before the flu season begins. Getting vaccinated early allows your body time — usually about two weeks — to develop immunity before activity picks up so you’ll be well protected.”Newman recommended September and October as good times to get vaccinated, ideally before the end of October.“However,” she added, “it’s important to note that it’s never too late. Getting a flu shot later in the season is still beneficial to protect yourself and those around you.”Flu shots are available to everyone and are free with most insurance or with government assistance. You can schedule an appointment with a primary care physician, pediatrician, etc. Drug stores like CVS, Walgreens, and Rite Aid often offer walk-in flu shots without an appointment. Pharmacies within grocery store chains like Kroger, Safeway, and Publix also offer flu shots. Community health clinics often provide flu shots at low or no cost, as do flu shot clinics.“Some employers offer flu shots to their employees at on-site clinics or through partnerships with healthcare providers,” said Newman. “Remember to check the specific location beforehand to verify availability, schedule, and any requirements.”The website Vaccines.gov can help people find and schedule flu vaccines in their area.Protecting yourself from illness during flu seasonThe flu isn’t the only virus expected to circulate this respiratory season.

Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) acknowledged Indonesia’s continuous efforts in the animal health sector and presented Letters of Appreciation for strengthening national animal health and food security. The Letters of Appreciation were conferred by FAO Representative in Indonesia and Timor Leste, Rajendra Aryal, to Indonesia’s Minister of Agriculture, Syahrul Yasin Limpo, at the Bulan Bhakti Peternakan dan Kesehatan Hewan peak event in Boyolali, Central Java, Friday (22/9). Indonesia, through the Ministry of Agriculture (MoA), has successfully controlled the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) in Indonesia for over a decade since the first HPAI outbreak in 2005. The Letters of Appreciation were also presented in recognition of the Ministry of Agriculture’s contribution in conserving the Bali Cattle (Bos javanicus domesticus, or Sapi Bali in local language) germplasm during the last thirteen years. On this occasion, Indonesia's Minister of Agriculture, Syahrul Yasin Limpo, emphasized that numerous parties were responsible for demonstrating Indonesia's capacities for producing native Indonesian cattle as well as controlling bird flu. "Our success must not be singled out from the hard work of the farmers, breeders, officers, academia, as well as the synergy of the cross-sectoral efforts," said Syahrul. Rajendra Aryal, FAO Representative in Indonesia and Timor Leste, praised the efforts and contributions made by the Ministry of Agriculture, “These Letters appraise the Ministry of Agriculture's inspirational examples in delivering results and making tremendous progress in strengthening Indonesia’s animal health sector and food system. It also proves that public services can be delivered more efficiently, effectively, and equitably to reach sustainable development goals for all, if worked together.” FAO has been working closely with the MoA to enhance Indonesia’s capacity and ability to control HPAI sustainably since 2005 when Indonesia became one of the global epicenters for human H5N1 avian influenza infections, with more human cases and fatalities than any other country until 2014. “To date, Indonesia, under the leadership of the MoA, and with the technical support of FAO and multisectoral stakeholders through One Health approach, has succeeded in controlling HPAI until it is no longer a pandemic”, explained Aryal. With this success, the productivity of poultry farms that produce animal food sources continue to rise, thereby safeguarding national food security. “Bali cattle have been recognized internationally as originating from Indonesia and are a national asset that needs to be preserved”, highlighted Aryal further. The Ministry of Agriculture has worked in protecting this germplasm through integrated measures, such as enforcing national regulations, to ensure optimal conservation and increasing productivity. “Efforts to find joint solutions for improving food resilience need to be continued by Indonesia and the global community, and FAO stands ready to provide the necessary support. FAO hopes that this appreciation will serve as an inspiration for other government agencies to prioritize commitment, hard work, and creativity in order to establish programmes with powerful impact,” added Aryal.

LIFE / HEALTH Debunking the "frat flu": Why do students get sick when they return to campus? Vivian Barrett September 19, 2023 SOLO Cups set up for a game at the Tin Can in East Lansing. Taken on January 17, 2023. — Photo by Henry Szymecko | The State News For many students, the first weeks back on campus are marked by runny noses and coughs, symptoms of a seemingly random sicknesses that affect nearly everyone. Students have coined the term ‘frat flu’ to describe these symptoms that often show up after they enter the college party scene. While students have a social understanding of the frat flu phenomenon, it doesn’t have a medical definition. So, what are students actually falling sick with? According to University Physician Michael Brown, the answer is quite simple: the common cold. “The most common are just your typical colds, which are hundreds of different viruses that cause those symptoms that probably everyone's experienced as a child and teenager before they maybe arrived on campus,” Brown said. “So nothing new to most of them. That's the vast majority.” Students tend to experience these symptoms during their return back to school because of the increased exposure to people on a college campus, Brown said. Between large class sizes, dormitory living and crowded social events, students are far more likely to interact with someone who has a virus. Microbiology and molecular genetics professor Shannon Manning said this level of exposure to people is combined with typical college-behavior that negatively affects students’ immune systems. “[The] transition back to school is difficult on your body and your immune system suffers a little bit when you're up all night, not getting enough sleep, partying,” Manning said. “All of those late nights combined with alcoholic beverages, et cetera, that will take a toll on your immune system.” Additionally, Manning said, because illnesses have an incubation period where the person is infectious but not symptomatic, there are often party-goers transmitting viruses they aren’t even aware they have. “When you go to these parties, you're surrounded by a lot of people, and a lot of people might not necessarily be symptomatic when they attend, but they might be infectious,” Manning said. “So then, that is more readily transmissible to partygoers.” The serious illnesses that students should be more worried about are influenza and COVID-19, Brown said. As COVID numbers rise across the country, Brown said we can expect to see a similar trend in Ingham County. Although COVID numbers can be harder to track now that a majority of testing is done at-home, hospitalizations due to COVID have doubled locally in recent weeks, Brown said. This suggests a relative peak in the virus, though it is much smaller than previously seen in the pandemic. Ingham County also participates in wastewater surveillance, which can be used to analyze COVID rates in the community. “Those numbers are going up and that's consistent with what we'd expect with the current rise in COVID cases,” Brown said. “You'd expect to see more of the virus circulating in the sewer system.” Brown said that he recommends students get the flu vaccine and the COVID vaccine to protect themselves and others. He also encouraged students to wear a mask when they are feeling any kind of symptoms in order to protect the people around them. “If they do get sick, feel sick, runny nose, cough, I really would encourage them to voluntarily put a mask on and and just think about those that they're protecting around,” Brown said. “Even if it's a run of the mill cold you know you can protect others by wearing a mask now.” On top of things like vaccines and masks, Manning said an important part of not getting sick is maintaining your health in general and allowing your immune system to stay strong. “Staying hydrated, eating healthy, getting enough rest, trying to keep stress at a minimum,” Manning said. “Being cautious, a little more cautious when you recognize that more severe viruses, it's not just the common cold, are increasing in frequency, like the Coronavirus.” Featured Local Savings Featured Local Savings Discussion Share and discuss “Debunking the "frat flu": Why do students get sick when they return to campus?” on social media. facebook twitter MSU Community: Share your voice post-shooting TRENDING MICHIGAN Human remains found in freezer in East Lansing residence Hannah Holycross MSU Republican Mike Balow wins spot on MSU board, second winner too close to call Theo Scheer MEN'S BASKETBALL What we learned in MSU men's basketball's blowout of Niagara Thomas Cobb MSU MSU board race still too close to call as Democrat takes lead for second seat Theo Scheer MEN'S BASKETBALL Comeback season has begun for MSU men's basketball Luke Joseph MEN'S BASKETBALL No. 1 Kansas on the clock for MSU men's basketball PJ Pfeiffer Sections news sports spotlight opinion classifieds obituaries Quick Links about advertise board of directors photo reprints privacy policy corrections & archives student positions Social alumni contact us email newsletter Latest Print Issue All Content © 2024 State News, Inc.

In an interview with IRNA on Sunday, Farhad Madadnejhad explained that FluGuard immunizes the recipient against diseases caused by type A and B influenza viruses. FluGuard contains pure proteins of recombinant hemagglutinin (HA) from four serotypes of the influenza virus. These serotypes are announced annually for seasonal vaccination against influenza by the World Health Organization (WHO). Mohammad Amin Ghobadi, the secretary of the Tehran Pharmacists Association, has previously stated that Iran ranks second globally, following the United States, in producing recombinant influenza vaccines. This achievement is attributed to the use of modern technology and collaboration with biotechnology industry elites. Ghobadi further added that this indigenous vaccine successfully passed all clinical trials years ago and has received approval from the Ministry of Health and various specialists. This year marks the third year of its production and consumption. "The proteins are produced in insect cell culture using the baculovirus expression system that is not able to replicate in human cells. Each one of four HA in cell line is being expressed by a baculovirus vector and then being extracted and purified by linear chromatography," according to the official website of FluGuard. "These proteins act as an antigen to induce humoral immune response hemagglutinin inhibitors antibodies." 6125**9417 Iran Society 1 Persons Tags Vaccine FluGuard FluGuard Vaccine Immunization Influenza Your Comment You are replying to: . × Cancel Reply Name Email Your Comment * Send Latest News Iranian bank cards can be used in Russia 2024-11-11 17:53 Astana talks: Iran warns of Israel’s expansionist goals in Syria 2024-11-11 17:39 Iran becomes vice-champion at Fencing World Cup in Algeria 2024-11-11 15:31 Sharif University holds student wedding ceremony 2024-11-11 14:15 Life in Salas-e Babajani Town 7 years after devastating quake 2024-11-11 14:10 Iran to make freight wagons for CIS members 2024-11-11 13:44 Rally held in Iran's Mashhad to show allegiance to Nasrallah 2024-11-11 13:10 US performance matters to Iran and entire region, not its elections: Iran FM spox 2024-11-11 13:09 Israeli cabinet agrees to outlines of truce proposed for Lebanon 2024-11-11 13:02 Iran unveils comprehensive geographic observatory system 2024-11-11 12:30 ADVERTISEMENT Desktop version Mobile version Powered by Nastooh Powered by NastoohGet Winter Strong: why having a flu vaccination matters – UK Health Security Agency Skip to main content GOV.UK Blog UK Health Security Agency Organisations: UK Health Security Agency Search blog https://ukhsa.blog.gov.uk/2023/09/20/get-winter-strong-why-having-a-flu-vaccination-matters/ Get Winter Strong: why having a flu vaccination matters Posted by: Blog Editor, Posted on: 20 September 2023 - Categories: flu Despite the recent hot and sunny weather, winter is coming, and with it comes an increased risk of catching flu. Flu can leave many of us feeling dreadful and laid up in bed for days, but for certain groups, the effects can be more severe or even life-threatening. Who is most at risk? People in older age groups, children 2 to 3 years old, pregnant women and those with certain health conditions are most at risk of getting seriously ill with flu. But the good news is they can help protect themselves by getting the flu vaccine. Who is eligible? If you’re vulnerable to flu you should take advantage of the vaccine to keep yourself well and winter strong. The following groups are eligible for a free flu vaccine: All adults aged 65 and over Anyone under 65 with certain health conditions like diabetes, heart disease, some neurological diseases, liver disease or a weakened immune system (for instance due to being prescribed steroids or treated for cancer) All pregnant women Children aged 2 to 3 years on 31 August 2023 All primary school children and secondary school aged children in years 7 to 11 Those living in care homes Certain carers Frontline health and social care workers Find eligibility details on the NHS website. Does the vaccine actually help? Last winter, getting vaccinated against flu cut the risk of being hospitalised by around: 66 per cent in children 25 per cent in adults aged 65 years and older 33 per cent in other adults with underlying health conditions Can flu harm children? Flu can be a very unpleasant illness in children, and for some, flu can lead to hospitalisation, and even death in rare cases. Last winter, over 10,000 children were hospitalised due to flu, and many of these could have been prevented by getting the vaccine. Children are offered the vaccine in the form of a quick and painless nasal spray vaccine, so it couldn’t be easier. Most children get it through their school, so parents should make sure to sign and return the consent form. For pre-schoolers, parents will be invited to bring their child forward in the coming weeks, or alternatively you can contact your GP practice to make an appointment. Does the vaccine protect children against flu? As well as helping to give children protection against flu, the vaccine also helps stop them passing it to elderly relatives such as grandparents, who will be more vulnerable. Because so many infections can be passed on in school, high vaccination uptake among children can also help prevent the spread of infection in the wider community. After vaccination, some kids may get mild side effects like a runny nose, but the vaccine cannot actually give them flu. Should pregnant women have a flu vaccination? All pregnant women are encouraged to get vaccinated to protect themselves and their unborn babies. Being pregnant changes how your body fights infections like the flu and catching it while pregnant increases your risk and your baby's risk of complications which may result in a stay in intensive care, or even death. The flu vaccine can be given safely to expectant mothers at any stage of pregnancy, even right from the start. You can speak to your GP practice, pharmacist or midwife now about booking a flu jab appointment. What about those with underlying health conditions? Individuals with certain underlying health conditions are eligible for a free flu vaccine. Conditions that would make someone eligible include those with: Heart or liver disease Chronic respiratory disease Diabetes Immunosuppression (weakened immune system) Some neurological conditions (like Parkinson’s, motor neurone disease, multiple sclerosis (MS) or cerebral palsy) A full list of who is eligible is available on the NHS website. When can I book? The National Booking system for flu vaccine will go live in a couple of weeks but some GP practices are already inviting people to attend. The vaccines are delivered in the autumn to provide protection before infection rates rise. Most eligible adults can get their flu vaccine at their GP practice or a local pharmacy now. Even if you were vaccinated last year, it is important to get your jab again this flu season because the viruses can change year to year and protection decreases over time. The best defence is to get your vaccine before the virus starts circulating. If you’re eligible, please take advantage of this preventative measure to keep yourself well and winter strong.

Here's what UAE doctors are saying Abu Dhabi authorises pharmacies to administer seasonal flu vaccine Seasonal flu rate returns to pre-pandemic levels in Abu Dhabi UAE: How to tell if you are at risk for pneumonia Dubai: With the winter flu season on its way, the health authorities in the UAE have urged residents, especially those at high risk, to get their influenza vaccines. Cases of influenza surge with the onset of winter months and the flu season in the UAE typically peaks between October and February. Since it takes two weeks for the flu vaccine to build immunity, health officials have urged residents to get their jabs as soon as possible. The call came as the Ministry of Health and Prevention (MoHAP) today launched the annual national seasonal influenza awareness campaign under the theme, “Protect Yourself... Protect Your Community”. The campaign targets a broad spectrum of society, with top priority given to pregnant women, individuals aged 50 and above, those with chronic medical conditions, children under five years, and healthcare workers. How to get vaccinated Hundreds of government and private healthcare facilities across the UAE provide the flu vaccine for residents. A quadrivalent flu vaccine that provides protection against four strains of viruses is available in the UAE. In Abu Dhabi, the flu vaccine is provided free of charge to all residents at government hospitals, schools and colleges. MoHAP is offering the flu jab for free to Emiratis and those among high-risk categories. In Dubai, the DHA is providing the vaccine at all government hospitals and primary health care centres. It is free for Emiratis and residents in the high-risk groups. In private hospitals, the flu jab costs anywhere between Dh50 and Dh125, depending on the facility. About influenza Seasonal influenza is a highly contagious respiratory illness, primarily spreading through the inhalation of droplets dispersed into the air when an infected individual coughs, sneezes, or talks. Its transmission can also occur through contact with surfaces or materials contaminated with the influenza virus, followed by touching the face, specifically the mouth, nose, or eyes. Hence, it’s vital to cultivate habits that hinder the proliferation of the infection, such as covering the mouth and nose when sneezing or coughing, regular handwashing, and the routine cleaning and disinfecting of surfaces and implements. Why vaccinate? Vaccination offers numerous advantages, such as lowering the chances of flu infection, hospitalisations, and flu-related fatalities, especially in children. Although a flu vaccine does not guarantee complete immunity, various studies have demonstrated its ability to mitigate the severity of illness. UAE health officials said individuals from the age of six months onward are encouraged to receive the vaccine, bearing in mind that it takes around two weeks for the body to develop immunity against the disease. The annual drive was unveiled by MoHAP in Dubai, in the presence of Mattar Saeed Al Nuaimi, director-general of the Abu Dhabi Public Health Centre. Also present were Dr Farida Al Hosani, executive director of Infectious Diseases at the Abu Dhabi Public Health Centre; Dr Nada Al Marzouqi, director of the Department of Public Health and Prevention at MoHAP; Dr Shamsa Lootah, director of Public Health Services Department at Emirates Health Services (EHS); and Dr Hend Al Awadhi, head of Health Promotion at Dubai Health Authority (DHA). National objectives The officials said the campaign seeks to achieve a set of objectives, which include bolstering health consciousness throughout society and promoting the critical importance of seasonal influenza vaccination. It also aims to impart knowledge to healthcare professionals regarding international best practices for influenza prevention and ensure vaccines are readily accessible to target demographics while boosting vaccination rates. To ensure widespread awareness, the initiative will be promoted through various channels, including social media platforms, newspapers, websites, television, and radio. Furthermore, visual awareness content will be distributed through television channels and news websites to reinforce the campaign’s message. In a statement issued on the occasion, Dr Hussain Abdul Rahman Al Rand, assistant undersecretary for the Public Health Sector, stressed the importance of the campaign, stating that not only does it serve to advance the UAE’s health system’s responsiveness to respiratory diseases, but it also strengthens the vital surveillance mechanisms in place. “Our concerted efforts seeking to enhance awareness and promote vaccination are not just measures but a testament to our commitment to nurturing a more sustainable, healthy society,” he said. “Aligning with the Ministry’s forward-looking strategy, we are keen to improve public health standards and foster a community deeply ingrained with awareness and a firm commitment to preventive health protocols. Through well-thought-out community health campaigns, we envision a nation marked by a superior quality of health and vitality. Together, we embark on this promising path, shaping a future where the well-being of every citizen is not just a priority but a reality.” Community support He urged the community to back the government’s national initiatives by committing to vaccination and adopting appropriate preventive practices, curbing the proliferation of seasonal influenza, thus enhancing the community’s overall preventive health. Dr Farida Al Hosany said: “We call on members of our community to support [our] efforts by receiving the seasonal influenza vaccine as soon as possible as it takes up to two weeks for the body to build sufficient immunity for protection against the disease.” Dr Nada Hassan Al Marzouqi emphasised that proactive health programmes, focusing on influenza prevention and promoting the significance of vaccination, constitute a vital facet of preventative healthcare. She highlighted that the ministry is keen to offer seasonal flu vaccinations to health workers, underscoring their pivotal role in safeguarding community health. Furthermore, Dr Shamsa Lootah encouraged the public to get vaccinated and adhere to precautionary measures to reduce the spread of the virus, thereby safeguarding their own well-being and that of the broader community and averting potential complications arising from influenza infections. Dr Hend Al Awadhi, Head of Health Promotion at Dubai Health Authority (DHA), said that the unified endeavours of every health stakeholder in the nation play a pivotal role in strengthening the cohesive care system for community members, particularly focusing on preventative measures.

In addition, respiratory infections are also on the rise, with the H3N2 virus being the prevalent strain. While H3N2 symptoms are milder compared to H1N1, some cases require hospitalization. In the south, severe forms of respiratory infections are being seen, progressing to bronchitis and pneumonia. This year's viral infections are more severe compared to previous years. Image used for representational purpose only. PANAJI: Viral infections are on the rise, with doctors seeing more dengue cases than they did last year. "The number of dengue cases this year is very uncharacteristic. Every day, I see a minimum of four to five new cases," said consultant physician Dr Rufino Monteiro.H3N2 is a subtype of the Influenza Most of the dengue patients coming to him are from Panaji, Caranzalem, Dona Paula, Santa Cruz, and Bambolim.Some are from as far as Calangute. "Dengue is really a big problem this year. It's not very fatal, but the problem is the platelet count drops very low in some cases ," said Monteiro. At Healthway Hospital, Old Goa, consultant physician Dr Chitralekha Nayak also says that 50% of her admissions are dengue cases, mostly from Panaji. Respiratory infections are also on the rise this time of year. Almost all the cases Nayak is seeing presently are of H3N2 (a subtype of the Influenza A virus). At the beginning of the monsoon, however, she was seeing only H1N1 (swine flu) cases, which was the prevalent virus last year.Nayak has found H3N2 to be milder than swine flu. "We do get elderly patients with H3N2 presenting with giddiness, getting admitted because they're too weak to get up from the bed or are not taking fluids orally, but they are discharged after two days. This year, the H3N2 virus symptoms are milder compared to the H1N1 we saw last year," she said. Where those with H1N1 presented with high-grade fever right from the start, progression into pneumonia was faster. H3N2 was more manageable, with fever touching a maximum of 101 degrees and weakness as a classic symptom. "I've not seen a bad pneumonia case because of H3N2, but weakness, loss of appetite and cough continue to trouble them for 15-20 days," said Nayak. However, in the south, pulmonologist Dr Pravin Bhat is not only seeing a rise in respiratory infections this monsoon but also more severe forms with severe wheezing and breathlessness, and admissions are required in some cases. He is also receiving H1NI and H3N2 cases besides those of influenza A and B. The cases are being seen in adults and in the paediatric age group. "Viral infections would come and go during the monsoons without causing much problem, but this year, we are seeing more severe forms. What would usually come as upper respiratory infections and disappear quickly are now progressing to the chest and developing into bronchitis and pneumonia," Bhat told TOI.End of ArticleFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA Visual Stories Previousâ10 spotted animals and their distinct markingsâLifestyle8 habits to train your brain for peace and happinessLifestyle10 brain-boosting activities based on ancient Indian traditionsLifestyle8 Healthy South Indian dinner ideasFoodâ10 animals that use tools to get work done like humansâLifestyleHow to make perfect Lentil soup (Dal soup) for feverFoodâ10 behavior kids copy directly from their momâLifestyleâ10 birds with names starting with the letter MLifestyle10 health benefits of doing pranayamLifestyle10 healthy breakfasts from different parts of the worldFood Next123 Photostories 5 traditional Indian hair oils for hair growthIndian states with the highest number of UNESCO World Heritage SitesHow tall are Trump family membersTirupati Laddu Controversy: Pawan Kalyan, Suriya, Prakash Raj; Reactions and controversial statements of film stars5 sneakers you should stay away from; a Nike shoe is also on the list!10 countries with the largest air forces in the worldZodiac Signs Who Have Good Sixth Sense5 places in India where entry is not allowed without travel permits7 vegetables that reduce belly fat quicklyMastering financial stability: Simple strategies for lasting wealth and security5 easy exercises that improve liver health within a monthTop 5 Indian states with the highest per capita income123Hot PicksJapan New PMNandini Ghee Tirupati LadduChina Submarine SinkHurricane HeleneMonkeypox in IndiaBengal Bihar Student AttackHurricane Helene StromTOP TRENDINGMohammed YunusColdplay Tickets RowMichael VaughanRandy OrtonKamala HarrisShehbaz SharifTimeless Lessons from KautilyaBettina AndersonZerodha CTONikki BellaTrending StoriesIn CityEntire Website9 Brain Exercises to Help Boost Memory and Creativity in Students'Diddy List': Names of celebrities connected to Sean Combs viralIs Musk dating Meloni?

Every year we encourage and remind the residents that this is the best time of the year to take the vaccine,” said Dr Farida Al Hosani, executive director of the Infectious Disease Sector at Abu Dhabi Public Health Centre, speaking with Khaleej Times. The Ministry of Health and Prevention (MoHAP) launched the annual national seasonal influenza awareness campaign under the theme, ‘Protect Yourself... Protect Your Community.’ The campaign is in collaboration with the Dubai Health Authority (DHA) and Emirates Health Services (EHS) with the goal of heightening immunity against influenza and minimizing the risk during the colder months. The campaign is set to run from September 2023 to March 2024. The campaign aims to impart knowledge to healthcare professionals regarding international best practices for influenza prevention and ensure vaccines are readily accessible to target demographics while boosting vaccination rates. In this season, the ministry encourages residents to take the influenza vaccine which is available in quadrivalent. “There are four different strains of influenza, and we provide it throughout the year. The cases usually start to rise from October until March and should be taken at the beginning of the season and the peak of influenza is usually recorded during December and January,” said Dr Al Hosani. The influenza vaccine, commonly known as the flu shot, is a preventive measure to protect against the seasonal flu virus. “The vaccine is available in health care facilities and primary health centres across the country. The EHS has around 134 facilities where the vaccines are available in Dubai, Sharjah, Ras Al Khaimah, Umm Al Quwain, Ajman, and Fujairah,” said Dr Shamsa Lootah, director of the Public Health Services Department at Emirates Health Services. The vaccines are available for free of charge for certain groups and for others, it is available at Dh 50. “For pregnant ladies, children below 5 years of age, and for the chronic disease it is available free of cost,” said Dr Lootah. She encouraged the public to get vaccinated and adhere to precautionary measures to reduce the spread of the virus, thereby safeguarding their own well-being and that of the broader community and averting potential complications arising from influenza infections. MoHAP's campaign emphasizes the following key points: Early Vaccination: Residents are urged to get their influenza shots as soon as possible, preferably before the peak of the flu season in December and January. High-Risk Groups: Priority will be given to high-risk groups, including the elderly, pregnant women, young children, and individuals with underlying health conditions. These groups are more vulnerable to severe complications from influenza. To ensure widespread awareness, the initiative will be promoted through various channels, including social media platforms, newspapers, websites, television, and radio. Furthermore, visual awareness content will be distributed through television channels and news websites to reinforce the campaign's message.

Discuss here! Start a discussion The Ministry of Public Health (MOPH), in collaboration with Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC) and Primary Health Care Corporation (PHCC), announced today the launch of the annual seasonal influenza vaccination campaign. Starting September 18, 2023, flu vaccines will be available free of charge at 90 health facilities, including 31 PHCC Health Centers, in addition to outpatient clinics at Hamad Medical Corporation and several semi-government and private hospitals and clinics across Qatar. Head of the Infectious Diseases Division at HMC, Dr. Abdullatif Al Khal said it was important for people to be proactive and protect themselves against the flu as early as possible. "The circulating flu viruses change from year to year, which is why it is so important that you receive the flu vaccine annually," Dr. Al Khal said. "We need to remember that flu is a serious disease that can lead to hospitalization and sometimes, even death, and should never be underestimated. "Fighting the flu starts with each and every one of us the vaccine is available at clinics across the country government, private and semi-private which makes it easier and more convenient than ever to receive the vaccine. I encourage everyone to get their free flu vaccine as soon as possible." Director of Health Protection and Communicable Disease Control Dr. Hamad Al Romaihi said while the flu is a serious illness and everyone six months of age and older should take the vaccine to protect themselves, some groups are more vulnerable than others. "People of all ages and health conditions can catch the flu virus and become sick, but there are certain key population groups who are at increased risk of the virus," Dr. Al Romaihi said. "These are people aged over 50 years; those with chronic conditions regardless of their age; children aged between six months and five years; pregnant women; and healthcare workers due to their close interaction with vulnerable patients and children," he added. For his part, Director of Health Protection, Preventive Health at PHCC Dr. Khalid Hamid Elawad encouraged the community to take the flu vaccine as soon as possible to build immunity before the winter season hits in the coming months. He reassured the community that they cannot get the flu from the flu shot and that the flu vaccine is one of the safest and most established vaccines, pointing that hundreds of millions of people around the world have safely received flu vaccines over the past 50 years. There has been extensive research supporting the safety of flu vaccines.
