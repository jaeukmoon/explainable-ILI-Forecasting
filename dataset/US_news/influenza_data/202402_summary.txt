Flu Activity and Severity: The flu continues to spread at high levels across the United States, with 14 million people sickened so far this season. There have been 150,000 flu-related hospitalizations and 9,400 deaths. The severity of flu cases is not limited to the elderly, as younger patients in their 20s to 40s are also being admitted with severe symptoms.
Child Deaths and Undercounting: As many as 40 children and teenagers, including five infants, have died from the flu this season. However, this number is likely an undercount based on previous CDC reports.
Symptoms of Severe Cases: Severe flu cases are characterized by symptoms such as dehydration, wheezing, severe head and muscle aches, and high fevers above 104 degrees.
Importance of Flu Shot: Severe cases of the flu can occur even in vaccinated individuals, highlighting the importance of getting a flu shot. Vaccination can reduce the severity of symptoms and prevent hospitalizations.
Warning Signs: Fevers, fatigue, and significant body aches are common symptoms of the flu. Fevers of at least 103 degrees and signs of severe dehydration require medical attention.
