The current method for managing influenza is vaccination using a standardized amount of the influenza virus’ primary surface antigen, hemagglutinin (HA), as the intended target of the immune response. This vaccination strategy results in vaccines with variable efficacy year to year due to antigenic drift of HA, which can be further exacerbated by manufacturing processes optimizing growth of vaccine virus in eggs. Due to these limitations, alternative vaccine platforms are actively being explored to improve influenza vaccine efficacy, including cell-based, recombinant protein, and mRNA vaccines. mRNA’s rapid, in vitro production makes it an appealing platform for influenza vaccination, and the success of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines in the clinic has encouraged the development of mRNA vaccines for other pathogens. Here, the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of a quadrivalent mRNA vaccine encoding HA from four seasonal influenza viruses, A/California/07/2009 (H1N1), A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 (H3N2), B/Brisbane/60/2008 (B-Victoria lineage), and B/Phuket/3073/2013 (B-Yamagata lineage), was evaluated. In mice, a 120 μg total dose of this quadrivalent mRNA vaccine induced robust antibody titers against each subtype that were commensurate with titers when each antigen was administered alone. Following A/California/04/2009 challenge, mice were fully protected from morbidity and mortality, even at doses as low as 1 μg of each antigen. Additionally, a single administration of 10 μg of quadrivalent mRNA was sufficient to prevent weight loss caused by A/California/04/2009. These results support the promise of this mRNA vaccine for prevention and mitigation of influenza vaccine.

Annually, seasonal influenza infection is estimated to result in 291,000–650,000 deaths worldwide2. In addition to the human cost of influenza, the virus is also responsible for widespread economic losses3. To protect against this widespread respiratory pathogen, the first influenza vaccine was developed in the 1940s by harvesting, concentrating, and inactivating virus from the allantoic fluid of embryonated hens’ eggs. Vaccination continues to be the primary defense employed against influenza, with the majority of vaccine used globally employing manufacturing processes that have changed little with time4,5.Three types of influenza vaccine are currently available within the United States: inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV), live attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIV), and recombinant hemagglutinin (HA) protein subunit vaccines6. These vaccines induce immune responses that primarily target the HA protein of a representative strain from each of the four influenza subtypes endemic in humans: A(H1N1), A(H3N2), B-Victoria lineage, and B-Yamagata lineage4. While HA is highly immunogenic, it also undergoes constant antigenic drift. This necessitates formulation meetings to assess needs for updating the vaccines to reflect contemporary viruses in circulation. In addition to antigenic drift, the means by which most IIV and LAIV are produced provide additional opportunities for immune escape by influenza viruses7. The time-consuming manufacture and distribution of influenza vaccines require that vaccine strain selection occur over six months before vaccine use, creating a window in which a new variant may emerge or become unexpectedly dominant8. This can result in mismatch between one or more of the vaccine components and circulating strains, as seen by the A(H3N2) mismatch in the 2015–2016 Northern Hemisphere flu season9. Further complicating this issue is the method by which vaccine virus stocks are grown. The majority of IIV and LAIV are produced by growing influenza virus in embryonated hens’ eggs, an environment distinct from the mammalian cell, in which the virus can acquire growth-promoting mutations7. These egg adaptations may affect viral antigenicity and create further antigenic distance between the vaccine and circulating strains. Cell-based manufacture has been expanded in recent years, but this technology has its own set of challenges and is therefore not as widespread as egg-based manufacture and does not shorten the time from strain selection to vaccine administration substantially10. The combination of these factors results in vaccines that have unpredictable efficacy from year to year.mRNA vaccines have been under development for decades, but the COVID-19 pandemic has catapulted this technology into the clinic. mRNA vaccines for influenza have several advantages over traditional IIV and LAIV. Production of mRNA vaccines is a fully in vitro process without the use of eggs or cell culture, eliminating the risk of viral growth-promoting mutations that may affect antigenicity. This is a particular concern for H3N2 vaccination as egg-adapted vaccine strains require a mutation that alters a key antigenic site11. Indeed, vaccination with H3 mRNA has been shown to more effectively induce antibodies against contemporary H3N2 viruses than IIV12. mRNA vaccines can also be produced more quickly than IIV and LAIV, which may reduce the time from strain selection to clinical administration and allow for a more rapid response to future influenza pandemics. The scalable production of mRNA vaccines also facilitates ease of updates to component vaccine strains in response to antigenic drift13. The potential advantages of influenza mRNA vaccines targeting HA have been long realized, with preclinical results published as early as 2001, in which Fleeton et al. found two 10 μg doses of mRNA encoding HA from A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (PR8) was able to protect 90% of mice from subsequent homologous challenge14. Subsequently, mice vaccinated with two 80 μg doses of PR8 HA mRNA were shown to have 100% survival following challenge with 10MLD50 PR8, and 100% survival with moderate clinical disease when vaccinated with a single 80 μg dose15. In 2018 a trivalent self-amplifying mRNA vaccine against HA from H1N1, H3N2, and influenza B viruses was found to be potently immunogenic and protective when given at a dose of 1.25 μg for immunization. This was the first study to demonstrate protective efficacy of a trivalent mRNA vaccine encoding HA from multiple subtypes following both H1N1 and H3N2 challenges16. mRNA vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 have been shown to be safe and effective in the clinic, strengthening the viability of this platform for influenza17,18. The results of these studies coupled with the success of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines has spurred the advancement of HA-specific monovalent and quadrivalent mRNA vaccines into clinical trials19,20,21.The mRNA platform is a powerful development in vaccine technology, not only in regards to their flexibility, speed, and scalability, but in that they offer an alternative approach to the development of a universal influenza vaccine. To that end, in a 2022 paper by Arevalo et al., vaccination with mRNA encoding 20 different HAs, representative of all A and B subtypes, induced humoral responses against all antigens and protected mice and ferrets from influenza challenge with matched and mismatched strains22. Furthermore, a natural extension of immunization with multivalent HA mRNA vaccines are multi-antigenic mRNA vaccines. In 2020 Freyn et al. reported broad protection in mice vaccinated with modified mRNA encoding conserved sequences from HA, NA, M2, and NP on a single strand of mRNA at a dose as low as 50 ng23. A recent study of a pentavalent modified mRNA vaccine targeting HA, NA, NP, and matrix protein 2 (M2) from B/Victoria/2/1987-like lineage and HA from B/Yamagata/16/1988-like lineage was found to induce broadly cross-reactive antibodies against ancestral and contemporary B viruses from both lineages, as well as protect mice from morbidity and mortality following challenge with a panel of influenza B viruses24. Similarly, a 2022 study of mRNA vaccines containing HA, NA, NP, and M2 targeting group 2 influenza viruses was found to protect mice from all challenge viruses, even when administered as a single dose of 125 ng25. These results demonstrate the promise of mRNA vaccines to improve breadth and efficacy of influenza vaccines.The studies presented here add to this growing body of work by demonstrating that quadrivalent influenza mRNA vaccines targeting HA from four seasonal subtypes produced by GreenLight Biosciences (GLB) are potently immunogenic and protective following challenge in the mouse model. Previous studies are expanded upon through preclinical optimization of these vaccines. Such optimization includes protective efficacy studies of modified and unmodified mRNA vaccines, evaluation of immune dampening effects when multiple antigens are concurrently targeted, and method of quadrivalent mRNA-LNP delivery. When assessed in mice, both monovalent and quadrivalent mRNA vaccines encoding HA elicited robust anti-HA antibody titers that were protective against viral challenge. Quadrivalent mRNA vaccines could be administered in formulations in which all mRNA strands were encapsulated in a single LNP or in individual LNPs at doses as low as 0.1 μg while remaining protective against viral challenge. Finally, a single dose of quadrivalent vaccine protected mice from morbidity and mortality as well as those that received two doses of vaccine following challenge.ResultsTransfection of mRNA vaccines result in expression of full-length A/California/07/2009 hemagglutinin in vitroTo ensure GLB mRNA vaccines encoding hemagglutinin (HA) could be successfully translated and expressed, 293T cells were transfected with modified and unmodified mRNA vaccines encoding HA from A/California/07/2009. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were lysed, and the lysate collected and centrifuged to separate soluble and insoluble fractions. Both fractions were run on MES SDS gels for detection of HA by Western blot. Expression of GAPDH was detected as a control (Fig. 1).Fig. 1: In vitro expression of mRNA encoding A/California/07/2009 hemagglutinin.Protein expression of 293T cells transfected with modified and unmodified mRNA encoding the HA of A/California/07/2009 was analyzed via Western blot; detection of GAPDH was used as a control.Full size imageFull-length HA, HA0, is composed of two subunits, HA1 and HA2, that are proteolytically cleaved during entry into the host cell. HA0 has a molecular mass of ~75 kDA, and HA1 and HA2 have molecular masses of ~55 kDa and ~25 kDa, respectively, though sizes can vary between strains due to differences in glycosylation26. When CA09 HA expression was evaluated, bands of 70 kDA were observed in both soluble and insoluble fractions, indicating expression of HA0 (Fig. 1). Though semi-quantitative, no appreciable difference in presence of HA0 was observed between either fraction, and both modified and unmodified CA09 mRNA vaccines exhibited similar expression of HA (Fig. 1). Faint bands present above 50 kDa in the soluble fractions indicated low-level expression of HA1 (Fig. 1). Therefore, both modified and unmodified mRNA successfully expressed both full-length and subunit HA in vitro.Modified and unmodified mRNA vaccines encoding A/California/07/2009 hemagglutinin protect mice from influenza infectionThe first step in evaluating influenza mRNA vaccine efficacy was to determine if use of modified and unmodified nucleosides affected mRNA vaccine immunogenicity or protection during infection. Modified nucleosides, namely pseudouridine, have been well-documented to increase translational efficiency of mRNA vaccines by reducing innate immune signaling and suppressing recognition of foreign dsRNA27,28,29. Furthermore, by dampening the innate immune response the reactogenic profile of mRNA vaccines can be tempered30,31,32. Therefore, to evaluate differences in immunogenicity and protection between mRNA influenza vaccine containing modified and unmodified nucleosides, mRNA encoding CA09 HA was administered to mice at doses of 5 and 30 μg at days 0 and 21. Control mice were given saline or LNP containing mRNA encoding firefly luciferase. Intermittent bleeds were taken for antibody analysis using the hemagglutination inhibition assay (HI). At day 42 (21 days post-boost), mice were challenged with 12MLD50 of CA09.Pre-boost (day 21), anti-HA antibody titers in all vaccine groups were significantly higher than in controls with geometric mean titers (GMTs) of 28.3 and 38.1 in the 5 and 30 μg unmodified groups, respectively, and 34 and 84.7 in the 5 and 30 μg modified groups, respectively (Fig. 2a). The difference in GMT HI titer between the 5 and 30 μg unmodified groups was not significant, but mice that received 30 μg of modified mRNA had significantly higher antibody titers than those that received 5 μg of modified mRNA (Fig. 2a). No statistically significant differences in titer between equivalent doses of each vaccine were found. Pre-challenge and post-boost (day 42), titers in all vaccine groups rose to GMTs of 342.4 and 768.6 in the 5 and 30 μg unmodified groups, respectively, and 640 and 2739 in the 5 and 30 μg modified groups, respectively (Fig. 2b). At this time point, titers in mice that received 30 μg of either mRNA were significantly higher than in the corresponding 5 μg groups (Fig. 2b). Furthermore, antibody induction in mice that received 30 μg of modified mRNA was significantly higher than in those that received 30 μg of unmodified mRNA (Fig. 2b). The difference in titer between the 5 μg groups was not statistically significant. Following challenge, all mice that received CA09 HA mRNA were completely protected from challenge with no observed clinical signs or weight loss (Fig. 2c, d).Fig. 2: Immunogenicity and protection of modified and unmodified A/California/07/2009 HA mRNA vaccines.6–8-week-old mice were vaccinated with 5 or 30 µg of modified or unmodified mRNA encoding A/California/07/2009 on days 0 and 21 for antibody analysis.

Mice were vaccinated with 30 μg of mRNA for each antigen individually or quadrivalently (QmRNA; 30 μg of each for 120 μg total) on a prime-boost schedule 21 days apart. Control animals were again given monovalent vaccine, saline, or LNPs containing irrelevant mRNA on the same prime-boost regimen and anti-HA antibody titers were determined by HI. Mice were challenged with 12MLD50 of CA09 21 days post-boost.Pre-boost (day 21), vaccine groups exhibited anti-HA antibody induction against all antigens that were significant compared to saline and LNP control animals, with GMTs of 84.7 and 160 in monovalent and quadrivalent groups when tested against CA09, respectively, 20 and 28.3 in monovalent and quadrivalent groups when tested against HK14, respectively, 47.6 and 40 in monovalent and quadrivalent groups when tested against BBris, respectively, and 177.1 and 190.3 in monovalent and quadrivalent groups when tested against BPhu, respectively (Fig. 3a–d). Post-boost (day 42), HI titers rose against all antigens with GMTs of 2739 and 1280 for CA09 monovalent and quadrivalent groups, respectively, 421.1 and 226.3 for HK14 monovalent and quadrivalent groups, respectively, 932.1 and 640 for BBris monovalent and quadrivalent groups, respectively, and 1318.3 and 1810.2 for BPhu monovalent and quadrivalent groups, respectively (Fig. 3a–d). Post-boost rises in titer compared to pre-boost titers were statistically significant against CA09 but not in the other antigen groups (Fig. 3a). At no time point were significant differences in antibody titer observed between monovalent and quadrivalent groups for any antigen, suggesting the administration of multiple mRNAs did not dampen the humoral response to individual antigens within the vaccine. Following challenge, mice that received monovalent CA09 or quadrivalent vaccine were completely protected from challenge, exhibiting 100% survival and no bodyweight loss (Fig. 3e, f). Therefore, mRNA vaccines for influenza can be administered in quadrivalent formulations to induce robust, protective anti-HA antibody responses against multiple viruses that are protective following CA09 challenge.Fig. 3: Immunogenicity and protection of monovalent vs. quadrivalent HA mRNA vaccines.6–8-week-old mice were vaccinated with 30 µg of monovalent seasonal HA mRNA or quadrivalent seasonal HA mRNA (120 µg total) on days 0 and 21.

Additionally, the above quadrivalent study used co-formulated mRNA vaccine; that is, mRNA for each antigen was encapsulated in a single LNP. Quadrivalent mRNA vaccines may also be “admixed” wherein each LNP contains mRNA encoding an individual antigen; mRNA-LNP complexes are then mixed prior to injection. To detect differences in antibody induction between each subtype and formulation, mice were vaccinated with quadrivalent mRNA at doses ranging from 10 to 0.01 μg of each antigen (40–0.04 μg total mRNA) at days 0 and 21; 21 days post-boost, mice were challenged with 12MLD50 of CA09. In addition, positive control mice were given two doses of 1.5 µg of 2017–2018 inactivated quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV) at days 0 and 21. Again, negative control animals were given saline or LNPs containing irrelevant mRNA and anti-HA antibody titer determined by HI. Of note, two days after vaccination one animal in the co-formulated 0.1 μg group was found dead. Necropsy of the animal concluded the death was “spontaneous or environmental disease unrelated to vaccine.” This group subsequently had a sample size of 3.Pre-boost (day 21), co-formulated mRNA induced anti-HA antibody titers against CA09 that were significantly elevated compared to control animals at the 10 and 1 μg doses with GMTs of 56.6 and 14.1, respectively, while only the 10 μg dose of admixed vaccine resulted in antibody induction (GMT of 134.5) that was statistically significant compared to the control groups (Fig. 4a). Post-boost (day 42), both co-formulated and admixed mRNA induced HI titers against CA09 that were significant compared to control animals at the 10, 1, and 0.1 μg doses with co-formulated GMTs of 761.1, 380.5, and 100.8, respectively, and admixed GMTs of 761.1, 226.274, and 33.6, respectively (Fig. 4a). When antibodies against HK14 were assayed post-boost, both co-formulated and admixed vaccines given at 10 and 1 μg induced titers that were significantly higher than controls with co-formulated GMTs of 56.6 and 28.3, respectively, and admixed GMTs of 160 and 33.6, respectively (Fig. 4b). When anti-HA BBris antibodies were evaluated, mice that received 10 μg of co-formulated vaccine had significantly higher titers (GMT of 23.8) than controls pre-boost. Post-boost, these titers rose in mice that received 10 or 1 μg (GMTs of 226.3 and 80, respectively) to statistical significance. Pre- and post-boost titers in those that received 10 μg of admixed vaccine (GMTs of 28.3 and 95.1, respectively) were also significant compared to controls (Fig. 4c). When antibody titers against BPhu were evaluated, mice that received 10 μg of vaccine had titers that were significant compared to saline and LNP controls both pre- and post-boost with GMTs of 47.6 and 95.1, respectively, in the co-formulated groups and 226.3 and 80, respectively, in the admixed groups (Fig. 4d). Additionally, titers in mice that received 1 μg of admixed vaccine were also significant pre- and post-boost (GMTs of 67.3 and 113.1, respectively). Titers in mice that received co-formulated vaccine at this dose became statistically significant following boost (pre- and post-boost GMTs of 20 and 40, respectively). No statistically significant differences in titer between pre- and post-boost were found in either formulation against any antigen at any dose (Fig. 4a–d). Modest dose-response effects were observed for each antigen, though no significant differences in antibody titer between doses within admixed and co-formulated groups, or between equivalent doses of each formulation were found either pre- or post-boost (Fig. 4a–d). Of note, only two mice developed HI titers against the evaluated strains when QIV was administered. Anti-HA antibody titers were observed against HK14 and BPhu in the first animal, while HI titers against BBris were present in the second (Fig. 4a–d). Therefore, both admixed and co-formulated quadrivalent mRNA vaccines more effectively induced anti-HA antibodies against all targeted strains when given at a comparable dose of 1 µg.Fig. 4: Immunogenicity and protection of co-formulated vs. admixed HA mRNA vaccines.6–8-week-old mice were vaccinated with quadrivalent vaccine containing 0.01–10 µg of mRNA encoding each HA subtype (0.04–40 µg total) or 1.5 µg of QIV on days 0 and 21. LNP and saline were used as controls. Bleeds were taken at days 0 (pre-boost) and 42 (post-boost) for antibody analysis. Mice were challenged with A/California/04/2009 at day 42. a CA09 anti-HA antibody titers of each vaccine group pre- and post-boost. b HK14 anti-HA antibody titers of each vaccine group pre- and post-boost. c BBris anti-HA antibody titers of each vaccine group pre- and post-boost. d BPhu anti-HA antibody titers of each vaccine group pre- and post-boost. e Kaplan–Meier survival curve of each vaccine group following CA09 challenge. f Percent bodyweight loss of each vaccine group following CA09 challenge.

LoD limit of detection; *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001; ****p < 0.0001.Full size imageDose and formulation differences in antibody induction against CA09 were reflected following challenge as mice that received 10 or 1 μg of co-formulated and admixed vaccine had 100% survival with no observed morbidity (Fig. 4e, f). In contrast, all mice that received 1.5 µg of QIV exhibited pronounced weight loss and succumbed to infection (Fig. 4e, f). Mice that received 0.1 μg of co-formulated vaccine also had 100% survival but lost up to ~8% bodyweight (Fig. 4e, f). Similarly, mice vaccinated with 0.1 μg of admixed vaccine had 75% survival with modest bodyweight loss of ~10% (Fig. 4e, f). Mice that were given 0.01 μg of either formulation had a 0% survival rate (Fig. 4e, f). The results of this study demonstrate that quadrivalent mRNA vaccines given at low doses induce differential antibody responses between subtypes that correspond to reductions in protection from infection as antibody titers decline. As no appreciable differences in immunogenicity and protection between co-formulated and admixed vaccines were found, and because the admixed formulation strategy provides more flexibility when manufacturing multi-component vaccines, the admixed formulation was used in all subsequent studies.Quadrivalent seasonal hemagglutinin mRNA vaccination protects against A/California/04/2009 infection following a single doseAs seasonal influenza vaccines are administered annually as a single dose in adults, the immunogenicity and efficacy of a single dose of admixed quadrivalent mRNA vaccine was next evaluated. Mice received 10ug of quadrivalent mRNA encoding each antigen (40 μg total) at day 0 (Prime) or days 0 and 21 (P-B) and, again, challenged with 12MLD50 of CA09 42 days post-initial immunization. When antibody induction was evaluated by HI in mice that received two doses of vaccine, anti-HA antibody titers were significant for all antigens when compared to LNP and saline controls with GMTs of 761.1, 160, 95.1, and 80 against CA09, HK14, BBris, and BPhu, respectively (Fig. 5a). At day 42 in mice that received a single dose, antibody titers against CA09, BBris, and BPhu were significant compared to controls with GMTs of 113.1, 67.3, and 28.3, respectively; however, a single 10ug dose of vaccine resulted in poor antibody induction (GMT of 5.9) against HK14 (Fig. 5a). There were no statistically significant differences in titer between one and two doses for any antigen; administration of a second dose did result in markedly higher titers against HK14, as discussed above, but did not reach statistical significance (Fig. 5a). Following challenge, mice that received either one or two doses of vaccine were completely protected from CA09 challenge, exhibiting no morbidity, and having 100% survival (Fig. 5b, c). Therefore, administration of a single dose of quadrivalent influenza mRNA vaccine resulted in robust antibody induction against most antigens that were protective following CA09 challenge.Fig. 5: Immunogenicity and protection of 1 vs. 2 doses of HA mRNA vaccine.6–8-week-old mice were vaccinated with quadrivalent vaccine containing 10 µg of mRNA encoding each HA subtype (40 µg total) on day 0 (prime) or days 0 and 21 (prime-boost). LNP and saline were used as controls. Bleeds were taken at days 0 (pre-boost) and 42 (post-boost) for antibody analysis.

The studies presented here add to this growing body of work by demonstrating that quadrivalent influenza mRNA vaccines targeting HA from four seasonal subtypes are potently immunogenic and protective following challenge in the mouse model and can be optimized to ensure protective efficacy while enabling flexible manufacture.mRNA construction was first optimized by evaluating immunogenicity and protective efficacy of modified and unmodified CA09 HA mRNA vaccines. Though both mRNA vaccines provided robust protection from viral challenge, modified mRNA induced significantly higher antibody titers than unmodified mRNA in the high-dose groups post-boost. Additionally, use of pseudouridine is consistent with mRNA vaccines currently available in the clinic, as most notably employed by both Moderna and Pfizer in the generation of their SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines which both employ 1-methyl-pseudouridine36,37. Therefore, based on the results of this study and demonstrated safety and efficacy in the clinic, we chose to pursue modified nucleoside mRNA vaccines.To ensure immune activation, we first administered monovalent and quadrivalent mRNA at doses of 30 μg of each antigen for a total of 120 μg in the quadrivalent group. This strategy resulted in antibody induction against each subtype that was consistent between monovalent and quadrivalent groups, demonstrating that potency of the mRNA vaccine is preserved when multiple antigens are targeted. Though no adverse reactions were observed in the mice, a total concentration of 120 µg of mRNA vaccine is higher than Spikevax and COMIRNATY adult dosing guidelines of two administrations of 100 and 30 μg, respectively17,18. Therefore, we next evaluated the protective efficacy of the quadrivalent mRNA vaccine when given at total doses of 40–0.04 µg. Though no clear dosing guidelines for influenza mRNA vaccines are available for humans at this time, early results from the phase I trial of Moderna’s quadrivalent seasonal flu vaccine, mRNA 1010, found that 50 µg was sufficient to induce GMTs of 538, 530, 467, and 261 against H1N1, H3N2, B-Victoria, and B-Yamagata strains, respectively, in young adults, and GMTs of 310, 263, 305, and 215 against H1N1, H3N2, B-Victoria, and B-Yamagata strains, respectively, in adults ≥5038. These results suggest that a dose of 40 µg of each strain for quadrivalent mRNA, as evaluated here, may be sufficient for clinical use.When quadrivalent vaccine dose was lowered, immunogenicity was maintained, and even at 1 μg of each component, quadrivalent mRNA vaccines protected against A/California/04/2009 challenge with little to no observed morbidity, whereas those that received a similar amount of QIV were not protected from influenza infection. In contrast, a study by Groves et al. found that mice given 1.5 μg of HA protein were only partially protected from A/California/07/2009 challenge, losing up to 15% bodyweight39. The low doses of quadrivalent vaccine evaluated here were effective regardless of mRNA-LNP administration method; however, when considering manufacturing constraints and the need to update component vaccine strains annually, the admixed formulation may lend itself more easily to these considerations. The results of the admixed dose de-escalation were also consistent with a study by Kistner et al. that found two 3.75 μg doses of whole inactivated CA09 provided 100% protection following CA09 challenge while two 0.15 μg doses resulted in 80% protection from CA09 challenge40. Finally, administration of a single 10 μg dose of GLB quadrivalent mRNA fully protected mice from CA09 challenge, though antibody induction against the H3N2 HK14 antigen after a single dose at this concentration was poor. It is unclear why immunization against HK14 HA resulted in substantially lower antibody induction following a single administration than the other antigens evaluated within these studies. Vaccination against H3N2 with recombinant protein or inactivated trivalent vaccine has been previously documented to induce lower HI titers than H1N1 so this may be an intrinsic feature of the H3 protein41. Though not used in the construction of these GLB mRNA vaccines, codon optimization of DNA vaccines has been found to improve H1 and H5 immunogenicity and may be an effective strategy to improve the potency of the H3 mRNA42,43. Larger doses of quadrivalent mRNA may also be considered. Alternatively, quadrivalent vaccines in the admixed formulation could be composed of varying concentrations of mRNA to optimize antibody induction against each antigen. This method is currently untested and will require further study to ensure each antigen remains appropriately immunogenic.The results presented here are encouraging and support the effectiveness of GLB quadrivalent influenza mRNA vaccines in generating HA-targeted neutralizing antibody responses which have been well-documented to correlate with protection from disease44,45,46. In addition to antibodies targeting HA, T cells are also an important immune mediator of infection and deserve analyses in future studies47. The presence of pre-existing CD4+ T cells has been shown to correlate with protection from influenza disease in humans, while memory CD8+ T cell activity is associated with protection from emerging influenza viruses48,49,50. An early study of influenza mRNA vaccines by Petsch et al. found mice vaccinated with PR8 HA mRNA exhibited CD4+ responses against a variety of MHC class II PR8 peptides as well as greater CD8+ cytotoxic activity than controls when tested with MHC class I PR8 peptides15. A study published by Chivukula et al. in 2021 found unmodified mRNA vaccines encoding H1N1 or H3N2 HA and NA induced humoral and cellular responses in mice that were protective following challenge51. Further, in nonhuman primates HA-stalk specific and NP mRNA vaccines have been found to elicit robust anti-stalk antibodies following HA immunization and CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses when vaccinated with NP mRNA; individually, both vaccines partially protected mice from lethal influenza challenge and were efficacious when administered together52. T cell induction has also been well-documented following SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination; preclinical evaluation of the Pfizer BNT162b SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine has demonstrated induction of Th1-biased CD4+, CD8+, and TFH responses in both mice and rhesus macaques, as did vaccination of rhesus macaques with Moderna mRNA-1273, though little CD8+ activity was observed after mRNA-1273 immunization53,54. Consistent with these findings, we have found that SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines produced by GreenLight Biosciences induce Th1-biased CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses in mice55. Further investigation is needed to fully elucidate the effect of influenza mRNA vaccination on T cell response, and future studies of GLB quadrivalent mRNA vaccines should include this analysis.Another marker of vaccine potency and efficacy that should be evaluated in subsequent quadrivalent influenza mRNA vaccine studies is longevity of the antibody response. Decline of IIV efficacy over time has been well-documented, even over the course of a single influenza season and is thought to correspond to waning antibody titers56,57. This decline is particularly pronounced in the elderly population that struggles to mount and maintain robust antibody responses to immunization with IIV and is at higher risk of influenza-related disease. Age has been found to be associated with early decline of HI titers to non-protective levels six months post-vaccination while a meta-analysis of studies reporting longitudinal HI titers found that by one year post-vaccination, titers fell to pre-vaccination levels in older adults58,59. Clinical data on the longevity of influenza mRNA vaccines is not currently available, but SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination has been shown to result in antibody titers that peak 3–4 weeks post-boost and begin to significantly decline 4–6 months later60. Future quadrivalent mRNA studies should include longitudinal serum sampling to understand the kinetics of antibody maintenance post-vaccination.All studies presented here were conducted in the murine model and while mice have several attractive features for use in the lab, the mouse model of influenza infection has notable weaknesses. As most influenza viruses do not cause natural disease in mice, influenza viruses must be adapted for murine infection, limiting the availability of challenge strains61,62. This limitation was reflected in the challenge data presented here; though mice were vaccinated with HA for multiple influenza subtypes, only CA09 was used for challenge as other mouse adapted virus stocks were not available. Therefore, protective efficacy of a quadrivalent mRNA vaccine could not be evaluated against seasonal influenza subtypes other than H1N1 and will have to be addressed in the future either through generation of mouse adapted viruses or with a different animal model.Overall, when preclinically assessed in mice, administration of quadrivalent mRNA vaccines targeting HA from four seasonal influenza subtypes resulted in robust antibody induction and protection from challenge in both mono and quadrivalent formulations. Admixed and co-formulated mRNA-LNP quadrivalent vaccines were both highly effective when administered at doses as low as 1 μg, remaining robustly immunogenic and protective against A/California/04/2009 infection, though use of the admixed formulation more easily enables customization of individual mRNAs and updates to component strains. Finally, administration of a single 10 μg dose of admixed quadrivalent mRNA-LNP induced antibody titers that were fully protective following A/California/04/2009 challenge. The results reported here demonstrate the potent immunogenicity and protective efficacy of quadrivalent mRNA-LNP influenza vaccines in a preclinical model.MethodsmRNA vaccine preparationmRNA vaccines were manufactured by GreenLight Biosciences. mRNA constructs contained modified (pseudouridine) or unmodified nucleosides and were non-stabilized into prefusion states. Sequences used for mRNA production were taken from GISAID and are as follows: A/California/07/2009 HA (EPI177294), A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 HA (EPI539576), B/Brisbane/60/2008 HA (EPI394898), and B/Phuket/3073/2013 HA (EPI529345). mRNA vaccines were encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles by Acuitas Therapeutics. The LNP is composed of 4 lipid components: a proprietary cationic lipid, a saturated phospholipid, a PEG-lipid and cholesterol. Admixed quadrivalent vaccines were created by mixing the fully formulated mRNA-LNPs. mRNA vaccines were diluted to final doses in sterile saline (Hospira 0409-4888-02).mRNA transfection293T cells were plated the day before transfection in 24-well flat bottom tissue culture treated plates, to be near 80%+ confluence the following day in MEM (Corning 10-010-CV) + 1% vitamin solution (Gibco 1112-052) + 1% antibiotic/antimycotic (Gibco 15240-062) + 1% L-Glutamine (Gibco 25030-081). To transfect, un-supplemented MEM was warmed at 37 °C before addition of 1.5 μL of MessengerMax Lipofectamine (Thermo Fisher LMRNA001) per 25 μL MEM and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. During the incubation, 1 μL of 1 mg/mL mRNA stock was added to 50 μL of MEM. 25 μL of mRNA+MEM was added to 25 μL of MEM+Lipofectamine to obtain a 1:1 solution and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Following incubation, the mRNA solution was added to one well/mRNA of the seeded 24-well plate and incubated for 48 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. After the 48-h incubation, lysates were collected by adding 100 μL of Lysis Buffer (Promega E194A) diluted to 1X in PBS to each well; lysate was removed and placed in labeled Eppendorf tubes. To separate soluble and insoluble fractions, lysate was spun at 15,871 × g for 1 min. The soluble fraction was placed in a clean Eppendorf and stored at −20 °C until needed. The insoluble fraction was resuspended in 100 μL of 1X lysis buffer and stored at −20 °C until needed.Western blotWestern blot gels were run using the NuPAGE MES kit (ThermoFisher NP0060). First, samples were prepared by combining 2.5 μL loading dye, 1 μL reducing agent, 2.5 μL Lysis Buffer (Promega E194A) diluted to 1X in PBS, and 4 μL of soluble or insoluble lysate from the mRNA transfections. Samples were then heated at 95 °C for 5 min. To prepare running buffer, 50 mL of 20X running buffer was added to 950 mL of dH2O and 2.5 mL of antioxidant. The gel cassette was prepared by assembling with tank apparatus; the comb was removed from the gel and wells were rinsed 3x with running buffer before being placed in the tank. Running buffer was added to the tank until the conductive wire was covered. 10 μL of each prepared sample was added to the wells with a 1 kDa protein ladder (Li-Cor 926-98000) for reference. The gel was run for 45 min at 150 V.Next, the blot was transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane using the BioRad Trans-Blot Turbo Transfer System and associated reagents (BioRad 17001915). To transfer, the gel and nitrocellulose membrane was placed in a cassette according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The blot was transferred using the mixed molecular weight setting for 7 min. Following transfer, the blot was blocked overnight at 4 °C with rocking in blocking buffer (Li-Cor 927-60001).After blocking, the blocking buffer was removed and 7 mL of primary antibody (A/California/07/2009 anti-HA rabbit pAb (Sino Biologicals 11085-T54), A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 anti-HA mouse mAb (eEnzyme MIA-H3-HK014), B/Brisbane/60/2008 anti-HA mouse mAb (eEnzyme MIB-HA-324), B/Phuket/3073/2013 anti-HA mouse mAb (eEnzyme MIB-HA-P12)) diluted 1:2000 in wash buffer (PBS + 1% Tween-20) was added to the blot and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with rocking. GAPDH was detected as a loading control using anti-GAPDH mouse mAb (Cell Signaling Technology 97166). After the incubation, the primary antibody was removed and the blot washed 5x with 7 mL of wash buffer, rocking for 5 min at room temperature during each wash. The blot was then covered with 8 mL of fluorescently labeled secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse IgG Li-Cor 926-32210; goat anti-rabbit IgG Li-Cor 926-68071) at a 1:10,000 dilution and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with rocking. Following the secondary antibody incubation, the blot was again washed 5x as described. Finally, the blot was visualized using the Li-Cor Odyssey Imaging System at 600 and 800 nm. Blots were from the same experiment or processed in parallel.Influenza virus propagationInfluenza viruses were grown in embryonated hens’ eggs as previously described63. Briefly, virus was diluted in sterile PBS + 1% antibiotic stock containing 200,000 units penicillin (Sigma P7794), 40,000 units streptomycin (Sigma S9137), 20,000 units Polymixin B (Fresenius Kabi 320110), and 4 mg gentamicin (Fresenius Kabi 1002). 100 μL of virus dilution was injected into the allantoic cavity with 1 mL syringes fitted with 25-gauge × 5/8-inch needles (Exel 26046). Eggs injected with A and B subtypes were incubated at 37 °C and 33 °C, respectively, for 48 h and chilled at 4 °C overnight before harvest. Allantoic fluid was removed and hemagglutination assays performed to determine titer. Viruses were sterility tested with blood agar plates (Edge Biologicals 2P-075) and confirmed via sequencing. Aliquots were stored at −80 °C until needed.Mouse modelsEight-week-old female C57BL/6 mice (n = 4 or 6 per group) were vaccinated with mRNA encoding seasonal influenza hemagglutinin. Mice that were vaccinated with CA09 HA had a sample size of n = 6. All other vaccination groups had samples sizes of n = 4. Animals received either a prime-only or prime-boost series of one or two intra-muscular injections, at days 0 and 21, containing a variety of mRNA concentrations in a volume of 50 μL per hind limb. Positive control mice received two 1.5 µg doses of 2017–2018 licensed inactivated quadrivalent influenza vaccine (Fluzone; Sanofi Pasteur inc. 49281-417-88). Negative control animals received 50 μL of saline or LNP-encapsulated firefly luciferase mRNA in the hind limb at days 0 and 21. Serum samples were collected at days 0, 21, and 42. Forty-two days after the priming dose, 20 μL of 1 × 104.67 TCID50/mL mouse adapted A/California/04/2009 was administered intranasally to isoflurane-anesthetized animals. Following challenge, mice were weighed daily for 14 days. A humane endpoint of ≥20% bodyweight loss was used. Animal studies were conducted in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health and approved under St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital’s Animal Care and Use Committee protocol 442.Hemagglutination inhibition assayHemagglutination inhibition assays were performed as previously described63. Prior to assay, sera were RDE treated by adding 3x volume of receptor destroying enzyme (Accurate Chemical YCC340122) to 1x volume of sera and incubated at 37 °C overnight. Sera was then heat treated at 56 °C for 1 h after which 6x volume of PBS was added to obtain a 1:10 starting dilution of sera. Sera was serially diluted in 25 μl of PBS in 96-well u-bottom microtiter plates and incubated with 25 μl of virus standardized to four agglutinating doses for 1 h at room temperature. 50 μl of guinea pig red blood cell suspension (Rockland R305-0050) at 1% in PBS + 0.5% BSA (Sigma A8327) was added to each well and the plates were incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Antibody titer was calculated as the inverse of the highest serum dilution that prevented agglutination. Samples that scored below the dilution threshold of 1:10 were given a value of 5.StatisticsStatistical tests were performed with GraphPad Prism Software, including Kaplan–Meier survival curves. Saline and LNP control values were combined for statistical analysis. Rank-based Mann–Whitney was used for statistical analysis and corrected for multiple comparisons by the Holm–Šidάk method.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.

Two fatal human infections with highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A H5N1 (bird flu) virus were reported by Cambodia. The viruses were identified as H5 clade 2.3.2.1c, which has circulated in Cambodia among birds/poultry for many years. This virus is different from the H5 virus that has caused outbreaks in wild birds, poultry, and other animals in the United States. CDC Update October 12, 2023 – Two fatal human infections with highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A H5N1 (bird flu) virus have been reported by Cambodia. These are the third and fourth human infections with HPAI H5N1 bird flu reported by Cambodia this year. The infected patients lived in two different provinces, and both infections likely resulted from exposure to infected poultry. Recent die-offs in poultry caused by H5N1 bird flu have been reported in parts of Cambodia, so sporadic H5N1 bird flu human infections are not surprising. An investigation to try to confirm the source of the infections and detect any additional cases is ongoing. These two fatal infections in Cambodia were in a child and an adult, both of whom had exposure to poultry prior to their illness. The infections were identified through influenza surveillance and alert systems. One patient presented with severe symptoms at an influenza sentinel surveillance hospital, and the other patient's death at a hospital triggered an alert to the local rapid response team. Close contacts of both patients, including potentially exposed health care workers, are being monitored closely. At this time, there is no indication that these two human infections with H5N1 pose a threat to the U.S. public. Genetic sequencing of patient specimens by the Institut Pasteur du Cambodge (IPC) and the Cambodian National Institute of Public Health (NIPH) has identified these viruses as being H5 clade 2.3.2.1c, which has circulated in Cambodia among birds/poultry for many years. These viruses have resulted in rare sporadic human infections in the past, including two cases in Cambodia in February 2023. This H5 clade 2.3.2.1c virus in Cambodia is different from the H5 virus that has caused wild bird and poultry outbreaks in the United States. The U.S. CDC is working closely with the Ministry of Health's Cambodia Communicable Disease Control (C-CDC) Department, the National Institute of Public Health in Cambodia, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, IPC, the World Health Organization, FAO, and the Wildlife Conservation Society of Cambodia to respond to these cases.

Areas with dense populations of poultry farms are at particular risk of HPAI transmission.Vaccination can be considered in addition to already implemented measures (e.g. surveillance, biosecurity and early detections) to prevent and control the spread of HPAI.What was EFSA asked to do?The European Commission requested an overview of the available HPAI vaccines, their efficacy How well something works in relation to predefined standards or expectations against currently circulating viruses and an assessment of various vaccination schemes to inform decisions on possible vaccination strategies.EFSA was also mandated to assess the surveillance and risk mitigation measures in vaccinated areas and farms. These topics will be addressed in a separate scientific opinion Opinions include risk assessments on general scientific issues, evaluations of an application for the authorisation of a product, substance or claim, or an evaluation of a risk assessment, with expected finalisation in March 2024.How did EFSA carry out this work?EFSA issued a scientific opinion on this topic in 2007: https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2903/j.efsa.2007.489In the current opinion, information about available vaccines and their characteristics was collected via a literature search, and in a survey that was launched by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and disseminated by EFSA and the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH). Data were also collected through consultation of the EU Reference Laboratory (EURL) and the National Reference Laboratory (NRL) network, and directly from pharmaceutical companies’ websites.The effectiveness of vaccination strategies was simulated using mathematical modelling.The data used were:Published literature (there were no restrictions on publication language or study location).Survey data.Data on poultry population in France, Italy and the Netherlands.Data on HPAI outbreaks in France, Italy and the Netherlands.Data on pre-emptive culling in France, Italy and the Netherlands.What were the limitations/uncertainties?Data on protection efficacy and duration of protection of available vaccines against HPAI are non-harmonised and few; therefore, the detailed description and comparison of these vaccines is not possible.Few vaccines are tested on poultry species A subdivision of the genus, a species is a group of closely related and similar-looking organisms; for example, in the case of Homo sapiens (humans), the second part of the name (sapiens) represents the species other than chickens.Field studies on the effectiveness of vaccination to stop virus transmission are scarce.What were the outcomes and their implications?OutcomesUpdated information was provided on types and characteristics of available vaccines against HPAI.There is only one authorised vaccine against HPAI in chickens in the EU.Insights were provided on different vaccination strategies for controlling HPAI in poultry, i.e. emergency protective vaccination in areas around a HPAI outbreak and preventive vaccination in areas and farms where the infection is not present yet. Recommendations were provided for future scientific studies on HPAI vaccines.ImplicationsEFSA’s scientific advice on HPAI vaccines and vaccination strategies will inform EU Member State policy makers and risk managers about potential prevention and control strategies for HPAI, thus enabling informed decisions on HPAI prevention and outbreak control. The advice from EFSA may guide future development and use of vaccines against HPAI.What are the key recommendations?Recommendations for policy makers and risk managers:Preventive vaccination is the optimal vaccination strategy to minimise the number of outbreaks and duration of epidemic and should be conducted in the most susceptible and infectious poultry species in high-risk transmission areas. Multiple administration (i.e. booster vaccinations) can be used to enhance protection.In case of an outbreak, emergency protective vaccination is recommended in a 3-km radius of the outbreak in high-risk transmission areas.Vaccine efficacy should be monitored for all vaccination strategies.Vaccination should complement and not replace other preventive and control measures, such as infection monitoring in birds, early detection and biosecurity, and is recommended as part of an integrated disease control approach.Recommendations for the research community:The scientific opinion includes recommendations for future scientific studies on HPAI vaccines in terms of the types of vaccines to develop and for which bird species, the aspects of the vaccines that should be researched and the type of studies that should be conducted. CaptionRecommended strategies for HPAI emergency protective vaccination and preventive vaccination.GlossaryAvailable vaccines: inactivated vaccines or vaccines based on principles other than live attenuated avian influenza virus that have marketing authorisation; vaccines used inside or outside the EU; and vaccines in late-stage development for which performance data (laboratory or field) are available.DisclaimerThis plain language summary (PLS) is a simplified communication of EFSA’s Vaccination of poultry against highly pathogenic avian influenza – Part 1.

The American Lung Association and Texas Biomedical Research Institute in San Antonio have teamed up to do just that: accelerate efforts to develop a universal flu vaccine, a type of shot which would not need to be delivered every year and would offer more protection than current vaccines. “Our goal is to come up with a universal vaccine that will immunize people against all influenza strains, with long-lasting protection,” said Luis Martinez-Sobrido, PhD, Professor at Texas Biomedical Research Institute (Texas Biomed). “This partnership with the American Lung Association enables us to move quickly with this vaccine research.”As the name implies, the three-year, $500,000 Accelerator Program grant to Texas Biomed from the American Lung Association Research Institute speeds up existing, promising research to drive innovations in respiratory health. Luis Martinez-Sobrido, PhD, Professor at Texas Biomedical Research Institute (Texas Biomed) In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that between October 2022 and April 2023, there were between 27 million and 54 million people sickened from influenza. During the same time period, there were 300,000-650,000 flu hospitalizations and 19,000-58,000 deaths attributed to the disease.Current influenza vaccines help protect people against severe illness and hospitalization from the four most commonly predicted circulating flu virus strains each year. Experts stress that these seasonal flu vaccines offer the best protection against flu and should be received each year by everyone from six months of age and older.Predicting Seasonal Flu StrainsEach year before flu season, scientists must predict which influenza strains are most likely to be prevalent in the upcoming months and select four of the strains to include in the next seasonal flu vaccine. Then, manufacturers need time to produce and distribute the vaccine. However, during that time, dominant strains of the virus can change in unexpected ways, potentially decreasing the protection provided by the vaccine.An effective universal flu vaccine could eliminate these problems by protecting its recipients against a wider variety of strains. It would ideally also provide long-term immunity, so people may not need to be vaccinated every year.Scientists have been approaching a universal flu vaccine by looking at similarities across flu virus strains. The strategy is to find one or two areas that don’t change much from strain to strain, and then train the immune system to make protective antibodies, thus protecting people from different strains at the same time.One promising area of interest is a portion of the flu protein called hemagglutinin (HA). While one portion of the HA protein, known as the head, tends to change as the flu virus spreads and evolves, a more stable portion, known as the stem, evolves more slowly. As a result, the stem is very similar across many different types of the flu virus, so directing the immune system to generate protective antibodies against the stem may provide broad protection across strains.Dr. Martinez-Sobrido’s team has previously worked to identify antibodies targeting slower-changing parts of the virus and to evaluate their protection in animal models. They are now working to develop a universal flu vaccine that generates antibodies that can broadly prevent flu virus strains from causing infection. The antibodies recognize key pieces of the virus to help a person’s immune system clear infected cells from the body. The hope is these antibodies can be used to both prevent and treat influenza.“This same vaccine technology could also be useful in developing a universal vaccine against SARS-CoV2, which causes COVID-19,” Martinez-Sobrido said. “That virus also constantly mutates and requires regular boosters to match circulating strains.”A Shared Vision for a Universal Flu Vaccine“Developing a universal flu vaccine to provide protection against seasonal and pandemic flu viruses would be a global public health breakthrough,” said Harold Wimmer, President and CEO of the American Lung Association.“As we witnessed with the most recent pandemic, there is a great need to create vaccines that reduce the symptoms of respiratory infection,” he said. “Texas Biomed is a global leader in translational research and has a long history of experience in vaccine development. Combined with the American Lung Association’s history of working towards preventing and improving lung disease, we share a vision to work towards creating a universal flu vaccine.”To learn more about the exciting work funded by the American Lung Association Research Institute, visit lung.orgesearch.

By convention, CD8 T cells recognize viral peptides, or epitopes, in association with classical major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I, or MHC-Ia, but immune surveillance can, in some cases, be directed against peptides presented by nonclassical MHC-Ib, in particular the MHC-E proteins (Qa-1 in mice and HLA-E in humans); however, the overall importance of nonclassical responses in antiviral immunity remains unclear. Similarly uncertain is the importance of ‘cryptic’ viral epitopes, defined as those undetectable by conventional mapping techniques. Here we used an immunopeptidomic approach to search for unconventional epitopes that drive T cell responses in mice infected with influenza virus A/Puerto Rico/8/1934. We identified a nine amino acid epitope, termed M-SL9, that drives a co-immunodominant, cytolytic CD8 T cell response that is unconventional in two major ways: first, it is presented by Qa-1, and second, it has a cryptic origin, mapping to an unannotated alternative reading frame product of the influenza matrix gene segment. Presentation and immunogenicity of M-SL9 are dependent on the second AUG codon of the positive sense matrix RNA segment, suggesting translation initiation by leaky ribosomal scanning. During influenza virus A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 infection, M-SL9-specific T cells exhibit a low level of egress from the lungs and strong differentiation into tissue-resident memory cells. Importantly, we show that M-SL9/Qa-1-specific T cells can be strongly induced by messenger RNA vaccination and that they can mediate antigen-specific cytolysis in vivo. Our results demonstrate that noncanonical translation products can account for an important fraction of the T cell repertoire and add to a growing body of evidence that MHC-E-restricted T cells could have substantial therapeutic value.

Sequence logo diagrams were prepared using unique core epitopes predicted to bind to (c,d) I-Ab or (e,f) I-Ed with a KD < 2,000 nM for peptides of (c,e) any origin or KD < 10,000 nM for peptides of (d,f) IAV origin. These sequence logos clearly exhibit the expected MHC-II ligand sequence motifs (based on ref. 34). g, The sequence logo diagram for all unique 9-mer peptide identifications (appearing as a small local peak in panel ‘a’) shows strong similarity to the H2-Kb and H2-Db sequence motifs, but not to the Qa-1 sequence motif (motifs available from NetMHCpan 4.0 at ref. 82). In sequence logo diagrams, ‘bit’ is a unit of relative amino acid frequency that is inversely related to the Shannon entropy of each position.Extended Data Fig. 2 Identification of M-SL9 by mass spectrometry and validation of immunogenicity in C57Bl/6 mice.a, MS2 spectrum resulting in M-SL9 identification, with b and y ion fragments indicated, along with mass/charge (m/z), retention time (RT), and P-value. b, c, Spleens were recovered from C57Bl/6 (N = 3) or BALB/c (N = 4) mice 9 days after infection with IAV PR8, and either bulk spleen cells or isolated spleen CD4 T cells were stimulated overnight with synthetic M-SL9 peptide, positive control peptides, or DMSO vehicle, and secreted IFN-γ was detected by ELISpot. b, For C57Bl/6 mice, the MHC-Ia control peptide was NS2109-121; the MHC-II control peptides were NP264-280 and NP306-322; and DC2.4 cells were used as the APC to stimulate CD4 T cells. c, For BALB/c mice, the MHC-II control peptides were NP55-71 and HA121-137, and A20 cells were used as the APC to stimulate CD4 T cells. Data points represent individual mice in one independent experiment; bars are the mean +/− s.e.m.Extended Data Fig. 3 Annotation of M-SL9 coding sequence within the full IAV PR8 matrix gene segment.The positive-sense RNA sequence is shown on top. Primary and secondary AUG codons are underlined and labeled, M-SL9 amino acids are highlighted in yellow, the M1 protein sequence is in light blue, M-MG16 nucleotides including stop codon are colored red, and relevant splice sites are labeled. The first nucleotide of each codon is aligned with the single-letter amino acid code and the first digit of the nucleotide number. This sequence was used to generate PR8 for this study and matches the sequence in GenBank accession AF389121.Extended Data Fig. 4 Intracellular cytokines, cytolytic markers, and FoxP3 expression in individual mice.a–d, Representative gating strategy for intracellular cytokine and cytolytic marker staining (lower boxes from two different experiments/stains). b–e, Lymphocytes were isolated from naïve (N = 21) or PR8 flu-infected (N = 34) C57Bl/6 mouse lungs, stimulated with indicated peptides, and stained for the indicated markers. b–d, Data for individual mice are shown in the same order for each epitope. c, Comparison of intracellular cytokine responses following infection with 40 FFU PR8 (N = 7), 160 FFU PR8 (N = 7), or no virus (naïve; N = 5), showing more consistent M-SL9 responses to 160 FFU. Female and male mice are indicated by purple and orange bars underneath the graphs. e, CD8 T cells (both total unstimulated as well as peptide-restimulated IFN-γ+ cells) from PR8-infected mice (N = 11) stain do not upregulate FoxP3 expression relative to the naïve (N = 4) mouse baseline. Gray events are all CD3+ cells; blue events and blue percentages represent CD3+ CD8+ cells. Bars show the mean +/- s.d. and P-values of interest are shown from a two-way ANOVA with Sidak’s multiple comparisons test comparing naïve and PR8-infected conditions. GzmB: granzyme B.Extended Data Fig. 5 Hybridoma clone B6.23 recognizes two forms of M-SL9 present in isolates of PR8.Amino acid sequences are shown for the originally identified M-SL9, present in pDZ PR8, and M-SL9-P, present in other PR8 isolates (for example GenBank V01099). B6-CIITA fibroblasts served as APCs and were co-cultured overnight with B6.23 cells in the presence of the indicated peptide concentrations. A sigmoidal curve was fit to the data points above (mean +/− s.d.), representative of three independent experiments. The geometric mean half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) values across all three experiments were computed as 940 ng/ml for M-SL9 and 51 ng/ml for M-SL9-P.Extended Data Fig. 6 Evidence supporting Qa-1 restriction of M-SL9.a, The MHC-Ia molecules H2-Db and H2-Kb are not stabilized on RMA-S cells by M-SL9 peptide. RMA-S cells bearing unstable empty MHC-I molecules (due to TAP deficiency) were incubated in the presence of the indicated synthetic peptides, and surface expression of H2-Db and H2-Kb was measured by flow cytometry. Mean fluorescence intensities of each stain were normalized to the negative control condition using HA91-107, an I-Ab-binding epitope with no known binding to H2-Db or H2-Kb, and shown as averages +/- s.d from 3 independent experiments. H2-Db-binding NP366-374 and H2-Kb-binding SIINFEKL were used as positive controls. b-e, Validation of HeLa cell lines and BMDCs showing Qa-1 restriction of M-SL9. b, The sufficiency of Qa-1b expression for M-SL9 presentation to its cognate T hybridoma was confirmed using a HeLa cell line transduced with full-length, wild-type Qa-1b and an untransduced parental HeLa cell line as a control. Bars are mean +/- s.e.m. from triplicate technical replicates, representative of 3 independent experiments, and P-values were calculated by Welch’s t-test (two-tailed). c, Qa-1 expression on cell lines used in b was validated by flow cytometry. d, The expected staining pattern was confirmed for HeLa cell lines used in Fig. 2; these lines were transduced with retroviruses encoding chimeric MHC-Ib molecules containing the α3 domain (D3) from H2-Db to allow efficient staining with the H2-Db D3-specific mAb 28-14-8. e, The expected staining pattern was also confirmed for BMDCs used in Fig. 2.Extended Data Fig. 7 Qdm/Qa-1b tetramer co-stains with NKG2A/C/E.a, Lung lymphocytes from naïve C57Bl/6 mice were stained with an anti-NKG2A/C/E mAb and Qdm/Qa-1b, M-SL9/Qa-1b, and control NP366-374/Db tetramers at 37 °C and gated on CD3− CD19− cells to interrogate natural killer (NK) cells. NK cells expressing NKG2A/C/E (the natural receptors for Qdm/Qa-1b) were the only population that stained with Qdm/Qa-1b tetramer, but neither these nor other NK cells stained with M-SL9/Qa-1b tetramer. b, C57Bl/6 mice were intranasally infected with 160 FFU of PR8 and 9 days later lung lymphocytes were stained with anti-NKG2A/C/E and the indicated tetramers at 37 °C. Qdm/Qa-1b tetramer generally stained PR8-induced CD8 T cells in a manner that was dependent on NKG2A/C/E but independent of TCR specificity. Flow plots are representative and show the gating strategy used, and bars show mean +/- s.e.m. for (a) N = 4 mice and (b) N = 5 to 6 mice per group across 2 independent experiments each. P-values are shown from two-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test.Extended Data Fig. 8 Analysis of TCRβ V and J gene usage in sorted CD8 T cell populations.a-d, CD8 T cell populations were sorted by FACS into three populations: naïve (CD44− CD62L+), M-SL9-specific (CD44+ M-SL9/Qa-1b tetramer+), and NP366-374-specific (CD44+ NP366-374/H2-Db tetramer+). Genomic DNA was isolated, the VDJ region of recombined TCRβ-coding genes was sequenced, and gene usage was analyzed by (a,b) the immunoSEQ Analyzer and (c,d) Immunarch. a-b, The frequencies of the top 10 most-used (a) V genes and (b) J genes, on average across all mice, are shown as stacked bar graphs, where each bar represents one mouse. c, Principal component analysis (PCA) of the Tcrb V and J gene usage showing clustering by T cell population. d, Pearson correlation analysis of M-SL9- and NP366-374-specific T cells showing greater correlation between mice within each T cell specificity rather than between specificities within each mouse. N = 6 mice, half males and half females.Extended Data Fig. 9 Tracking CD69 and CD103 expression in PR8-infected mice.a-d, C57Bl/6 mice were intranasally infected with 160 FFU of PR8 and were euthanized at day 6 (N = 7), 9 (N = 5-6), 14, 31 (N = 7), or 56 (N = 9) to collect the indicated tissues/fluids. Uninfected mice were used as day 0 controls (N = 7-11). a, Gating strategy. b, Frequency of all CD3+ T cells in lung and BALF over time, showing the lack of T cell infiltration in uninfected mice (plotted as day 0). Data points were omitted when there were <20 live singlet CD3+ CD8+ T cells collected in total. P-values are calculated from Brown-Forsythe and Welch one-way ANOVA with Dunnett T3 multiple comparisons test comparing each condition to day 0 controls. c, Frequency of CD103+ and CD69+ CD8 T cells (analyzed separately) in lung and BALF starting from the approximate peak of the T cell response on day 9. d, Frequency of CD103+ CD69+ double positive TRM cells in lung at 9 days after PR8 only, X31 only, or PR8 prime and X31 boost. c, d, P-values were calculated by two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test.Extended Data Fig. 10 Sequence evolution and variation of the M-SL9 epitope and open reading frame in IAV strains over time since 1980.a–c, Sequence logo diagrams were produced from M-SL9-homologous sequences from (a) human H1N1 isolates, (b) human H3N2 isolates, and (c) H5N1 isolates from all avian species, downloaded between April and June 2023 for the indicated sample collection time periods. The BV-BRC database was used for sequences from 1980-1999, while the GISAID database was used for all others. Diagrams were created using the ggseqlogo package in R, and the y-axis units are the probability of each amino acid from 0 to 1. H1N1 sequences after 2009 correspond to the swine-origin pandemic H1N1 lineage, while H1N1 sequences prior to 2009 are from the earlier seasonal H1N1 lineage; sequences from 2009 were omitted to avoid ambiguity. Amino acids are numbered so that position 1 corresponds to the initial serine residue of the M-SL9 epitope, and the preceding residue was designated as position −1 and shown to assess the presence of an initiation codon. The two forms of M-SL9 encoded by PR8 isolates are shown at bottom; note that the avian H5N1 consensus sequence exactly matches the M-SL9-P amino acid sequence.Supplementary informationSupplementary InformationSupplementary Tables 1 and 2.Reporting SummarySource dataSource Data Fig. 7Source data for Fig. 7d (full unprocessed image for IAV matrix RNA primer extension gel).Rights and permissionsSpringer Nature or its licensor (e.g. a society or other partner) holds exclusive rights to this article under a publishing agreement with the author(s) or other rightsholder(s); author self-archiving of the accepted manuscript version of this article is solely governed by the terms of such publishing agreement and applicable law.Reprints and permissionsAbout this articleCite this articleHogan, M.J., Maheshwari, N., Begg, B.E. et al.

Fact: There’s no way the flu vaccine can give you an entirely separate disease (according to the CDC). In fact, the flu shot can’t even give you the flu. Some people have mild symptoms after getting the vaccine, but even if they do, the symptoms don’t last long at all. Mild symptoms are the normal result of your body’s immune response to the vaccine. 2. Myth: The flu shot will protect you from COVID-19. Fact: There’s no evidence that flu shots can protect you from COVID-19, an entirely different disease. Having said that, the flu shot can help protect you from having the flu, which results is hundreds of thousands of hospitalizations a year and thousands of deaths. Plus, with the continued spread of COVID-19, experts warn that without proper precautions, we could experience a “twindemic” of both flu and COVID-19. 3. Myth: I got a flu shot last year so I don't need another. Fact: It would be great if there could be a lifetime vaccination against the flu, but it just doesn’t work that way. Each year, the types of flu change, so researchers have to develop vaccines that match the specific strain of flu that’s occurring that year. Plus, the bodies' immune response from vaccination runs out over time. So, getting an annual flu shot is the best way to ensure we’re protected from the flu. 4. Myth: The flu shot will give me the flu. Fact: Not true! The CDC explains why. Flu shots are made in two ways: With inactive (dead) flu viruses that aren't infectious; or With one gene from a flu virus, as opposed to the whole virus (which isn’t strong enough to cause an infection). So, even if you feel mildly achy after a flu shot, it's light years better than spending days in bed immobile because you didn’t get a flu vaccine and then came down with the actual flu. 5. Myth: The flu shot will make me more susceptible to other respiratory diseases. Fact: One study from 2012 suggested that people who receive the influenza vaccination are at a greater risk for other diseases with symptoms like a runny nose and a sore throat. A lot of people heard about the preliminary finding, and word spread like wildfire that the connection was definitely true. Researchers were then prompted to delve deeper into the association, and numerous studies have since disproved the link. The CDC states that medical professionals are unclear why the 2012 study suggested those results, but that it's not something to be concerned about whatsoever, and that it shouldn't deter you from getting your flu shot. 6. Myth: Getting the actual flu will make me immune. Fact: We’ve all heard people say that they aren’t getting a vaccine because they’ll probably catch it anyway. They think once they get it, the immunity will cover them for the next time the flu comes around. The CDC reports that this is a bad decision -- getting the flu comes with the risks of dehydration, hospitalization, and other health complications, even if you're a relatively healthy person before getting sick. It's much better to get a flu shot and try and prevent the flu than to wait to catch it. And for those who say “I never get the flu,” there’s always a first time! 7. Myth: I'm healthy, so I don't need a flu shot. Fact: False. It is true that the risk of severe flu complications is higher if you have an underlying health condition, but even strong, healthy people can get very sick, even to the point of being hospitalized. Health experts recommend that everyone 6 months of age and older get a flu shot. Just because you’ve never had the flu doesn’t mean you can’t get it. 8. Myth: The flu shot doesn't even work. Fact: Health experts will tell you that the flu shot isn’t perfect. But, even though it’s not 100% effective, wouldn’t you rather get the shot with the odds you could avoid the flu? Plus, flu shots have been proven to reduce the risk of flu-related hospitalizations. A new CDC study found that people who had received a flu vaccine were half as likely to be hospitalized with flu compared to people who had not been vaccinated. In recent years the vaccine reduced children's chances of landing in the ICU by 74% and adults by 40%. 9. Myth: It's too far into flu season to get the shot. Fact: Even though experts suggest we get our flu shots early (Sept./Oct.), most agree that since the flu season can last until April, it’s not too late to be vaccinated, even if you’re finishing up your Christmas shopping. 10. Myth: Pregnant women shouldn’t be vaccinated. Fact: Not true. It’s very important to be vaccinated when you are pregnant as the flu has been linked to miscarriages. There may be a rare case where your doctor would advise against it based on an underlying health condition, but for almost all women, it’s one of the more important ways you can protect yourself and your baby. 11. Myth: Kids should not get a flu shot. Fact: False! Anyone over six months of age, particularly children, should get the flu shot. A 2022 study found that kids who got a flu shot reduced their risk of severe life-threatening influenza by 75%. For more information on the flu vaccine, visit Flu Vaccine.

Study: Creating resistance to avian influenza infection through genome editing of the ANP32 gene family. Image Credit: Sonsedska Yuliia / Shutterstock Background Influenza A viruses (IAVs) pose significant global economic, health, and pandemic risks due to their impact on poultry and potential for human infection. Current control strategies, like vaccination, are unreliable and controversial, underscoring the need for innovative solutions. The interaction between IAV's ribonucleic acid (RNA) polymerase and host-specific ANP32 proteins is key to the virus's ability to infect different species. However, comprehensive solutions require further research on viral adaptation, the efficacy of multi-gene editing, and the broader consequences of such genetic changes. About the study Fertile eggs from Hy-line layer flocks at the National Avian Research Facility in the United Kingdom (UK) were utilized in experiments that adhered to UK regulations, were reviewed by ethical boards, and conducted by licensed personnel. Primordial germ cells (PGCs) were extracted from eggs, cultured, and expanded before gene editing. Various CRISPR/Cas9 vectors were employed for editing, with sequences selected using a design tool and synthesized by companies like Invitrogen and Integrated deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) Technologies. Several strategies were used to edit ANP32A, ANP32B, and ANP32E genes. Edited cells were screened using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and Sanger sequencing, with specific primers for each gene alteration. For transcriptome analysis, PGCs were expanded, RNA was subsequently extracted and subjected to quality checks, then utilized for complementary DNA (cDNA) library construction, followed by RNA-seq performance, with the resulting reads undergoing filtration and quality analysis. Data was mapped to the chicken genome assembly, and differential expression analysis was conducted. This extensive process ensured the careful, regulated study and modification of genes within PGCs for research purposes. In the study, ANP32A expression was analyzed in both gene-edited cells and ANP32A- knockout (AKO) embryos, utilizing the Radioimmunoprecipitation Assay Buffer (RIPA) lysis buffer and a series of protocols for lysing and subsequent western blotting. Specific antibodies were used in the immunoblotting phase, followed by a visualization process involving the Odyssey Imaging System. In another experiment, 150,000 PGCs underwent differentiation into fibroblast-like cells through a series of incubations and medium changes, with specific conditions and ingredients for the culture medium. Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were maintained under specific conditions, and a special set of triple-knockout human eHAP1 cells was utilized. Influenza polymerase activity was evaluated using a chicken polI minigenome system and various plasmids. Different procedures and ingredients were followed for transfection, incubation, and lysis before assessing bioluminescence. In vivo experiments involved Hy-line layer chickens with specific housing, inoculation, and monitoring procedures to study influenza virus transmission. Various assays were used for virus titration, including plaque assay on MDCK cells and haemagglutination inhibition assays. Further, viruses isolated from chicken swabs were sequenced after inoculation into chicken eggs and fluid harvest, with detailed RNA extraction, PCR amplification, and sequencing protocols. Infection studies on human airway epithelial cells involved specific washing, infection, and harvest protocols. A competition assay was conducted between different virus strains in chicken eggs or human cells, with a meticulous procedure for RNA extraction, cDNA generation, and PCR amplification. Statistical analysis was carried out using various methods depending on the experiment, including T-tests and Analysis of Variance (ANOVAs), among others, with illustrations graphically represented for clarity and comprehensive interpretation. Study results Researchers utilized CRISPR/Cas9 and a short single-stranded oligonucleotide (ssODN) template to engineer a minute but significant alteration in the chicken ANP32A gene, intending to thwart IAV replication. This alteration, executed in PGCs, was meticulously analyzed, revealing no off-target mutations or significant gene expression changes. Notably, IAV polymerase activity was hindered in the edited cells, emphasizing ANP32A's role in viral replication. a Schematic of low-dose in vivo challenge of 2-week-old chickens with H9N2-UDL influenza A virus (A/chicken/Pakistan/UDL01/08). Chickens were housed in negative pressure poultry isolators. Prior to challenge all birds were bled from the wing vein to obtain pre-infection sera. Groups of ten WT (black) chickens or ten ANP32AN129I-D130N (white) chickens were intranasally inoculated with 1 × 103 PFU of H9N2-UDL virus per bird. Uninoculated sentinel chickens were introduced into the isolators 24 h post infection to assess for transmission from the directly inoculated birds. Oropharyngeal cavities of each bird were swabbed daily from the day of inoculation (D0) until day 7 (D7) post-inoculation. Infectious virus titre in swabs was measured by plaque assay on MDCK cells (b, c). c Bird ID number for directly inoculated ANP32AN129I-D130N birds above the detection limit is indicated. DL detection limit of 10 PFU/ml for plaque assay. Related StoriesStudy reveals distinct genetic risk factors for influenza and COVID-19A call for robust H5N1 influenza preparedness and responseUS study uncovers antiviral resistance in swine-origin influenza, urging enhanced pandemic surveillanceThe genetic intervention was executed by transferring edited PGCs into host embryos, leading to the birth of live chickens that solely generated edited gametes. These birds were subsequently mated, with offspring bearing the desired genetic edit. Observations indicated normal development, behavior, and growth among the edited chickens, similar to their wild-type counterparts. The efficacy of this genetic modification was tested by exposing the chickens to IAV. Remarkably, while the virus thrived in wild-type birds, it was virtually inactive within the ANP32A-edited population, barring one instance of reduced viral activity. Subsequent serological tests largely corroborated the absence of active infections within the edited group, hinting at the potential of this genetic approach in rendering chickens resistant to IAV-a breakthrough with substantial implications for avian health and associated industries. The resilience of the edited chickens was further evaluated against increased IAV exposure. Even when subjected to a virus dose a thousandfold higher, the modified chickens displayed no infection signs, in stark contrast to the wild-type group that exhibited pronounced viral activity and transmission. Minimal and sporadic virus shedding was noted among the edited chickens, indicating a significant dampening of viral activity and spread due to genetic modification. An in-depth analysis of the viruses from the edited chickens revealed specific mutations, especially within the PA viz polymerase acidic protein gene and PB2 viz polymerase basic protein 2 genes. These mutations enhanced the interaction between the viral polymerase and the modified ANP32A protein, a discovery with potential implications for human health, as the same mutations also improved the virus's efficiency with human ANP32 proteins. However, these mutations did not offer a distinct advantage in chicken cells or eggs, suggesting further complexity in the virus's potential human adaptation, possibly necessitating additional alterations in the viral Hemagglutinin (HA) protein. Further structural examinations suggested that these mutations' effects might be mediated through indirect structural changes rather than direct interactions with the ANP32A protein, underscoring the intricate host-virus dynamics in influenza's species barrier and adaptation risks. Moreover, in the face of ANP32A absence, the PA-349K PB2-M631L double mutant H9N2-UDL escape virus replicated in chicken embryos, a testament to its adaptability. Experiments further revealed that the complete deletion of ANP32A did not entirely deter certain mutant influenza strains, suggesting the necessity for broader edits across all ANP32 variants to achieve comprehensive influenza resistance in chickens.

A recently published study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found adults ages 65 or older are at increased risk for COVID-19 associated hospitalization and other severe outcomes. The CDC found people over 65 accounted for 62.9 percent of COVID-19 associated hospitalizations, 61.3 percent of intensive care unit admissions, and 87.9 percent of in-hospital deaths associated with COVID-19 hospitalizations. Unfortunately, the study also found that less than 25 percent of people over the age of 65 who were hospitalized for COVID-19 were up to date on their COVID-19 vaccines. Similarly, the CDC estimates that approximately 90 percent of influenza-related deaths and 50-70 percent of influenza-related hospitalizations occur in people over the age of 65. The CDC states that these findings add to the growing body of evidence on the importance of older adults getting their annual flu vaccine. Lastly, older people are at increased risk from RSV, and the CDC recommends adults 60 years and older talk with their health care provider about whether RSV vaccination is right for them. UMB recommends every person follow the CDC’s recommendations for the COVID-19, flu and RSV vaccines. However, as the above research illustrates, older people are at greater risk from COVID-19, influenza, and RSV. If you are in this age group, please get your vaccines this fall or talk to your health care provider about what vaccines are right for you. If you have family or friends in this age group, please encourage them to get vaccinated or talk to their health care provider. Their life may depend on it.

Opens in a new tab or window Share on X. Opens in a new tab or window Share on LinkedIn. Opens in a new tab or window email article BOSTON – Breastfeeding boosted the protective effect of maternal flu vaccination during pregnancy for infants, a large retrospective cohort study showed. Combined, maternal vaccination plus any exposure to human milk in the first 3 months of life was associated with a 56% lower likelihood of influenza in infants (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.44, 95% CI 0.27-0.70), reported Anne-Marie Rick, MD, MPH, PhD, of the University of Pittsburgh. Exclusive breastfeeding on top of vaccination exerted an even bigger benefit (aOR 0.37, 95% CI 0.21-0.67), according to findings detailed at the IDWeek annual meeting. "The key message I'd like to share is that breastfeeding -- any amount of it -- really does work to help protect babies," Rick told MedPage Today. "As clinicians, we can communicate this and try to support our moms in any way we can, because women face so many challenges to breastfeeding." In the study, maternal vaccination alone was associated with about a 45% reduced odds of infant influenza, while breastfeeding alone was not significantly protective (aOR 0.74, 95% CI 0.49-1.12). Children younger than 6 months are not eligible for the flu vaccine, despite having a high risk of influenza and its complications, Rick explained. These include hospitalization, need for supplemental oxygen, and secondary bacterial infections (including pneumonia and ear infections). And while flu deaths among infants are rare in the U.S., infant influenza is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality globally, she said. "We are lucky in the U.S. that this is not something we typically see." Extant data already suggest that breastfeeding alone can reduce the risk of respiratory infections in infants. But Rick and her colleagues wanted to specifically know how maternal vaccination and breastfeeding work together to protect infants against the flu. To do so, they queried the University of Pittsburgh's electronic health record database from 2012 to 2019, extracting information on 44,132 mother-infant pairs who had at least two well-child visits during the infants' first year of life. The primary outcome was lab-confirmed influenza during the infant's first 6 months. About half of the mothers (51.3%) had received the flu vaccine during pregnancy, and this was pretty evenly split across trimesters. Most of the infants of vaccinated women (60.1%) received human milk at some time during the first 3 months of life. Among the unvaccinated pairs, 57.9% received human milk at some time during the first 3 months. A total of 141 infants (0.3%) developed laboratory-confirmed influenza between birth and 6 months of age. Models adjusted for siblings at home and low socioeconomic status. The researchers didn't break down the protective effect by vaccine timing. But a prior study, which Rick presented earlier this year at the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, indicated that vaccines given during the second trimester conferred the biggest protective benefit, reducing the risk of infant influenza-like illness by 79%. First-trimester vaccination reduced the risk by 39%, while vaccination during the third trimester did not protect the infant, she said. This finding probably has to do with the time it takes to manufacture antibodies and then transfer enough of them to build up fetal immunity, she said. "But we shouldn't be using these data to recommend timing for a maternal vaccine," said Rick. "Pregnant women are at higher risk for influenza and its complications and should get a vaccine on board as soon as possible. The vaccine is meant to protect them, so we don't want to wait to enhance any possible benefit to the baby. Any protection to the child is secondary." However, the information can be used to help get maternal vaccination rates up, she said, especially given the hesitation among some women and even some ob-gyns about vaccination during the first trimester. In 2017, researchers at the Marshfield Clinic Research Institute in Wisconsin, Kaiser Permanente, and the CDC, found a doubling of miscarriage in a cohort of women who had the inactivated flu vaccine in 2010-2011 and 2011-2012. While the association was significant, no causative link was found. That study lingers, Rick said, giving some clinicians pause about early pregnancy maternal immunization. "It's important to know that if you do wait to give it until the second trimester, there is this benefit to the infant," she said, "although we should never advise a woman to wait until then to get vaccinated." Disclosures Rick is a consultant for Pfizer on the Pediatric and Maternal Immunization Expert Group, and medical director for the Human Milk Science Institute and Biobank.

This means flu season is around the corner, too. The flu, or influenza, is a viral infection that attacks your nose, throat and lungs.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. PolicySo, when exactly is flu season? And when does flu season start?In the U.S., flu season can start as early as October. But sometimes, it doesn’t rear its head until January or February.Infectious disease specialist Kristin Englund, MD, explains how we can predict the start of flu season.How long does flu season last?To get an idea of how heavy or light our flu season will be, we look to patterns in the Southern Hemisphere. And it’s why experts are foreseeing a flu season with more cases this year.“We often use Australia as a way to predict what we’re going to have because they’re kind of a season ahead of us,” Dr. Englund explains. “This year, they’ve seen a rise in the number of cases of influenza. And we are certainly going to see a significant rise in the number of cases of influenza this year as well.”When it comes to last year’s flu season in the U.S., the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that from October 1, 2022 through April 30, 2023, there were 27 to 54 million flu illnesses, with 300,000 to 650,000 flu hospitalizations — and 19,000 to 58,000 deaths related to the flu.As for what to expect this year? Dr. Englund says flu season won’t be as light as it was a few years ago.Advertisement“While our numbers of influenza cases will likely be higher this year, we don’t expect the tripledemic that we saw last year — when RSV, COVID-19 and influenza all hit hard in the same few months,” she adds. “This year, we’re optimistic that the new RSV vaccine will protect many older Americans. The updated COVID-19 and influenza vaccines will be important for everyone to get as well.”When is flu season over?There are reported cases of the flu in the U.S. year-round. But when it comes to flu season, the CDC says flu cases typically start to rise in October and peak between December and February. In some years, flu season months may extend into May.“Influenza A season usually ends around March, but that is when we can see influenza B rising, so the flu season is usually around until April or May,” says Dr. Englund. “You can check out actual numbers of flu cases on your local health department’s website or at cdc.gov for the Centers for Disease Control.”Is flu season the same each year?No, says Dr. Englund. Think of the last few years and how other viruses like COVID-19 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) affected flu season.“A few years ago, everyone was masking and practicing hand hygiene,” she continues. “We were socially distancing and not going out, because of COVID-19. Influenza is spread the same way, so we were protecting ourselves from influenza as well.”With the introduction of the COVID-19 vaccines and the lifting of mask requirements, people started going out more. This shifted the following year’s flu season — and the forthcoming one as well — when we saw more cases of RSV.Other factors like the kind of circulating strain of influenza, timing of flu season, how well the flu vaccine works and how many people get the flu shot can all play a role in how the flu season will unfold.Bottom line?Even if a flu season is deemed “light” or not as bad as years past, it’s still important that you get your flu shot, advises Dr. Englund.The vaccine, which is updated each year to reflect circulating strains, reduces your chances of getting the flu or becoming severely ill if you do.And the flu vaccine is even more critical for older adults who are over the age of 65, children under the age of 5, pregnant people and people with certain health conditions such as asthma, COPD, diabetes or a weakened immune system.“While every case of influenza can’t be prevented, everyone should do their part to protect themselves and those around them — by getting your flu shot, washing your hands, staying home when you are sick,” encourages Dr. Englund. “You could save someone’s life.”AdvertisementLearn more about our editorial process.Health LibraryFlu (Influenza)OverviewSymptoms and CausesDiagnosis and TestsManagement and TreatmentPreventionHealth LibraryFlu (Influenza)OverviewSymptoms and CausesDiagnosis and TestsManagement and TreatmentPreventionAdvertisementRelated ArticlesOctober 29, 2024/Children's HealthRSV vs. Pneumonia: Sorting out Your Child’s Fever and CoughRSV can lead your child to develop pneumonia and have trouble breathingOctober 23, 2024/Cold, Flu & Respiratory IllnessesWhat Is Respiratory Season, and Are You Ready?Getting vaccinated in October can help protect you against severe illness between November and MarchOctober 8, 2024/Mental HealthHands Off!

Budd said that the agency is not detecting the unusually early rise in flu activity that occurred last year, when kids and teenagers were hit especially hard.Most of the flu cases reported so far this season are influenza type A, specifically the H1N1 strain. A CDC report released Thursday found that children were "disproportionately impacted" by the flu last year. One of the study's authors, Danielle Iuliano, also a senior research epidemiologist at the CDC, said that the numbers of flu-related pediatric doctors' visits and hospitalizations were higher during the 2022-23 flu season than in previous years. Nearly all of those cases were flu type A, mostly H3N2. Just under 20% were classified as H1N1."Given what we saw last year," Iuliano said, "vaccinating kids is really important to prevent them from getting sick, prevent them from being hospitalized and having the most severe outcomes." Doctors recommend that everyone 6 months and older get an annual flu shot, and say that now is the time to make that appointment.Latest on Covid, RSV and other virusesPeople who have had Covid at least 5 times describe how the symptoms changed. Is it a Covid, RSV or the flu? How to tell the difference between symptoms. Paxlovid may reduce the chance of long Covid. Why don't doctors prescribe it more? "I tell my patients to get vaccinated by Halloween," said Dr. Kristin Englund, an infectious disease physician at the Cleveland Clinic. It takes at least two weeks after getting the shot to make antibodies for the maximum possible protection. "We want to make sure everybody is protected before the holiday season, and that starts with Thanksgiving," Englund said. Will there be a tripledemic? Three bugs are likely to circulate this winter: flu, Covid and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). There are early signs that those viruses are already spreading, though at relatively low levels, according to WastewaterSCAN. The group receives data from wastewater collection sites in 36 states three times a week, looking for evidence of viruses shed in sewage."We have started to see some increases in the rate at which we're detecting flu across the country" as well as RSV, said Marlene Wolfe, an assistant professor of environmental health at Emory University and program director for WastewaterSCAN. A late summer uptick in Covid seems to have peaked, Wolfe said. "But those levels are still quite a bit higher on average right now than they were in the middle of the summer," Wolfe said. Still, doctors urge people to do what they can to keep viral activity down as the U.S. heads into cold and flu season — including masking in some cases. Updated Covid shots and a new vaccine protecting pregnant women and older adults against RSV are available.In anticipation of increases of Covid, RSV and the flu, the Cleveland Clinic will begin requesting that everyone visiting hospitalized patients wear a mask starting next week. It is not a mandate, however.People "come here to get better, and not necessarily to get exposed to something new," Englund said. "They certainly don't need to be getting sicker from a visitor or a caregiver who might have any of these respiratory viruses."Follow NBC HEALTH on Twitter & Facebook.

But the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s messaging this year might look a little different from previous vaccination seasons. The agency has launched a messaging campaign dubbed “Wild to Mild” that uses adorable critters to illustrate how a vaccine can tame a bout with the flu by reducing its strength from that of an elephant or a lion to that of a mouse or a kitten.The framing might come as a surprise to those used to a blunter way of talking about vaccines: get vaccinated or get sick. But Wild to Mild is designed to be a more honest, nuanced portrayal of the benefits of the influenza vaccine, which scientists have long recognized is better at reducing serious infections than at preventing infection altogether.“We tend to take kind of a black-and-white approach to vaccines of ‘if you get vaccinated, it will keep you from getting that particular disease,’” says Sarah Bauerle Bass, a social and behavioral scientist at Temple University, who focuses on health and risk communication. “The pro is that it’s a very simple message; the con is that it doesn’t necessarily communicate the reality of vaccines, which is that sometimes you do get that disease even though you’re vaccinated.”On supporting science journalismIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing.

For some shots, such as those for measles and polio, the black-and-white approach is essentially true, says William Schaffner, a professor of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University. If you received the standard vaccine regimen as a child, your odds of ever catching those particular diseases are tiny: around 1 percent for each.But flu doesn’t work the same way. Measles and polio are static viruses, whereas influenza mutates regularly, allowing it to evade our immune system even if it’s been trained to identify the pathogen via prior infection or vaccination. In addition, influenza is a family of viruses, and typically the flu vaccine administered in the U.S. targets only four strains. These strains are selected based on the ones that are circulating in the Southern Hemisphere more than six months before flu season begins in the North. Selecting which strains to target is a guessing game—one that scientists can’t always win. Credit: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD) These factors give the influenza vaccine a spotty record in preventing disease—at least to an untrained eye. “During well-matched seasons, we see [risk reduction] numbers pretty consistently within the range of 40 to 60 percent” among the vaccinated, says Erin Burns, associate director of communications for the influenza division at the CDC. “I think the public perception, maybe, is that that is less than impressive.”The perceived “low” protection can cause people to hesitate about receiving the vaccine. “There’s a very widely held perception that the flu vaccine doesn’t work,” she says. “People think that if they get vaccinated, and then they get sick, the vaccine has failed.”But that’s not an accurate view of what public health experts expect the flu vaccine to accomplish, Schaffner says, adding that he’s been encouraging the messaging pivot for years now. Mild influenza occurs mostly in the respiratory tract, where vaccine-induced defenses aren’t as effective because they can’t reach the surface of the mucus membranes in, for example, your nose, he says. That’s where the virus might first enter your body and cause flu’s mild symptoms, such as a runny nose—so vaccination doesn’t do much against these infections.Instead the vaccine produces defenses that are active deeper in the body—in the heart, liver and kidney, for example—and can stop the virus from sneaking into organs, where it can cause a severe to possibly life-threatening infection. For the flu, vaccination isn’t about reducing infections overall but instead about reducing the hundreds of thousands of hospitalizations and tens of thousands of deaths the disease causes in the U.S. each year.The Wild to Mild campaign, Burns says, is designed to counter the idea that the flu vaccine doesn’t work and present a more accurate understanding of the shot’s purpose. “We were realizing that we needed to reset those expectations,” she says. She isn’t concerned that advertising the fact that the flu vaccine doesn’t offer total protection could reduce uptake because the perception of its failure is already so widespread.The Wild to Mild approach also addresses another common misperception: that the flu isn’t a serious illness. CDC scientists are “emphasizing the severity of the disease without scaring people, and they’re empowering [people],” says Saad Omer, an epidemiologist and dean of the O’Donnell School of Public Health at the University of Texas Southwestern. “They’re saying, ‘It can be wild, but you can make it mild because you have the power to do that.’”Howard Markel, a physician and historian of medicine at the University of Michigan, says he sees a dramatic shift in the way the public has come to think about vaccines in general. “If you grew up in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s, vaccines were like a gift,” Markel says. Shots were also mostly for children then, he notes, unlike the modern flu vaccine, with its annual campaigns targeting all adults.Now public perception of vaccines in general is much more neutral—and, in some cases, deeply skeptical—and views are politically polarized. “Our tolerance is less, too, for any error [or] anything less than perfection in our science and medicine,” he says.Meanwhile the CDC has struggled to sell some Americans on COVID vaccines—particularly in the form of annual shots that are available each fall, like the flu vaccine is. Temple University’s Bass says that the COVID vaccine has suffered from the same perception of ineffectiveness as the flu vaccine for similar reasons.Burns says the Wild to Mild campaign came about independently from the agency’s COVID experience, although flu vaccine uptake rates have dipped slightly since the pandemic’s first winter. “People are still more open to flu vaccines than they are to COVID vaccines,” she says.Still, public health officials acknowledge that some people will never get the flu vaccine, and they are focusing on vaccine education that will help increase uptake among undecided people. “You go into these campaigns knowing that you’re never going to get 100 percent of people,” Bass says. “What you’re really aiming for is that large group in the middle who might, with either the right messaging or the right messengers, be more likely to do that.”In that way, Wild to Mild is an uncanny embodiment of the flu vaccine itself, which can’t prevent all infections but can nonetheless reduce the disease’s impacts. “We can do a lot of good with this vaccine,” Schaffner says. “We can turn wild to mild while we’re waiting for the perfect science to give us the perfect flu vaccine. It’s not here yet. Let’s do the best we can with what we have today.”Rights & PermissionsMeghan Bartels is a science journalist based in New York City.

podcast Home About ECDC Media centre Flu Awareness Campaign 2023 Media centre Flu Awareness Campaign 2023 Campaign Twitter Facebook Linked In Mail The Flu Awareness Campaign is marked across the WHO European Region every year in October. It aims to raise awareness of the importance of vaccination for people’s health and well-being and to increase the uptake of seasonal influenza vaccination of people with underlying risk factors. Why a specific campaign on influenza? Influenza is usually mild and most people recover quickly, but some people are at high risk of serious complications, some of which can be life-threatening and result in death. The elderly, pregnant women, young children and people with underlying health conditions are more likely than others to develop severe disease if they should be infected. In addition, health care workers are more exposed to different viruses on a daily basis, including the influenza virus, and should be vaccinated to protect themselves and their patients. Influenza is a disease with high social and economic costs, and vaccination is the best way to prevent the disease. As influenza viruses change, vaccination against influenza is needed every year to keep up with the circulating viruses. In the northern hemisphere, the seasonal influenza circulation is observed between November up to May, so October is the optimal time to receive an influenza vaccination.

In chickens, influenza A virus (IAV) relies on host protein ANP32A. Here we use CRISPR/Cas9 to generate homozygous gene edited (GE) chickens containing two ANP32A amino acid substitutions that prevent viral polymerase interaction. After IAV challenge, 9/10 edited chickens remain uninfected. Challenge with a higher dose, however, led to breakthrough infections. Breakthrough IAV virus contained IAV polymerase gene mutations that conferred adaptation to the edited chicken ANP32A. Unexpectedly, this virus also replicated in chicken embryos edited to remove the entire ANP32A gene and instead co-opted alternative ANP32 protein family members, chicken ANP32B and ANP32E. Additional genome editing for removal of ANP32B and ANP32E eliminated all viral growth in chicken cells. Our data illustrate a first proof of concept step to generate IAV-resistant chickens and show that multiple genetic modifications will be required to curtail viral escape.

Avian influenza in poultry poses a constant zoonotic threat to humans with the possibility for evolution of novel IAVs with pandemic potential4. At the current time, a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1 subtype clade 2.3.4.4b is geographically dispersed across Asia, Europe, Africa and the Americas, associated with wild birds die offs, devastating impacts on farmed poultry and numerous incursions into mammals including some human cases and deaths5. Poultry vaccination for control of avian influenza is not reliable due to the rapid antigenic drift of field viruses and is controversial due to political and economic implications6.The heterotrimeric viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, comprised of PB1, PB2 and PA proteins, is responsible for transcription and replication of the IAV genome in the host cell nucleus, but depends on essential support from the host-encoded ANP32 family of proteins, ANP32A and ANP32B7. An important difference exists between avian and mammalian ANP32A, whereby the avian protein has an additional 33-amino-acid sequence between its N-terminal leucine rich region (LRR) and the C-terminal low complexity acidic region (LCAR) domains. The shorter mammalian ANP32 proteins do not efficiently support avian influenza polymerase and this accounts for a host range restriction that limits the infection of humans when exposed to infected birds8. However, the virus can acquire mutations, usually in PB2 or PA subunits, that adapt polymerase to use mammalian ANP32 proteins, or can acquire these segments from a mammalian-adapted virus by a process of reassortment, and this is a prelude for the emergence of pandemic influenza1. In human cells, ANP32A and ANP32B serve redundant roles to support influenza polymerase9. In chicken cells, ANP32A is solely responsible for the pro-viral function while ANP32B is inactive10. In both species, ANP32E is suggested to have an antiviral effect11. Replication of the viral genome requires the formation of a replicative platform consisting of two heterotrimeric polymerase molecules bridged by ANP32A to form an asymmetric dimer12. The amino acids 129N and 130D in the fifth leucine-rich repeat (LRR) of ANP32A are critical for this interaction. Chicken ANP32B contains the amino acids 129I and 130N, and does not interact with the viral polymerase, accounting for its inability to support polymerase activity10,13. Here, we tested the hypothesis that IAV infection and transmission will be abrogated in chickens containing the two N129I and D130N substitutions engineered into ANP32A. We used genome editing (GE) to alter these residues in the ANP32A gene and generated ANP32A-GE chickens to test for resistance to avian influenza infection.ResultsGeneration of genome-edited primordial germ cellsTo generate ANP32A-GE (ANP32AN129I-D130N) cells and chickens, we applied CRISPR/Cas9 and a short single-stranded oligonucleotide (ssODN) template to introduce a 3-nucleotide base-pair change in exon 4 of ANP32A creating a two-amino-acid substitution (Fig. 1a)14,15. We targeted the locus in in vitro propagated male and female chicken primordial germ cells (PGCs) and then cultured single PGCs to establish clonal GE cell lines (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 1). Sanger sequencing of clonal cells identified cells containing biallelic edits. We examined the top predicted CRISPR/Cas9 off-target sites and detected no off-target mutations in selected GE clonal lines (Supplementary Fig. 2). We also confirmed that ANP32A protein expression levels were not altered in the GE PGC lines using western blot analysis (Supplementary Fig. 3). Principal component analysis (PCA) and heat maps generated from an RNA transcriptome analysis showed that the PGCs cluster by sex and cell line rather than the ANP32A genotype of the cells, indicative of no significant changes in the transcriptome of the edited cells (Supplementary Figs. 4 and 5).Fig. 1: Breeding strategy for homozygous ANP32AN129I-D130N chicken.a ANP32A editing strategy: two nucleotide changes (red letters) introduce asparagine (N) position 129 (N129I) and aspartic acid (D) position 130 (D130N) missense mutations. The third nucleotide change (green letters) is a synonymous mutation in the gRNA PAM and serves as a marker control for allelic contribution from the male and female surrogate hosts. b Male and female PGC cultures were derived from the blood of individual chick embryos. The PGCs were edited, and clonal lines of GE PGCs were propagated and analysed. GE PGCs were differentiated into fibroblast-like cells for IAV polymerase assays. To generate GE chicks, GE PGCs were mixed with B/B dimerisation compound (to induce cell death of host embryo germ cells) and injected into iCaspase9 host embryos, which were incubated to hatch. After hatching, the surrogate hosts were raised to sexual maturity and directly mated. All offspring from eggs laid by the surrogate hosts were biallelic for the edit and contained the parent-specific PAM nucleotide change. c the activity of reconstituted IAV polymerase was assessed in fibroblast-like cells derived from ANP32Aknockout (Knockout), ANP32AN129I-D130N (N129I-D130N) or wild-type (WT) PGCs. Cells were transfected with avian IAV polymerase (PB2/627E - black bars) or human-adapted isoforms (PB2/627K - grey bars), Firefly minigenome reporter and Renilla reporter control plasmids and then incubated at 37 °C for 48 h. Wild-type chicken ANP32A (chA) cDNA was co-expressed with minigenome plasmids to rescue polymerase activity in ANP32AN129I-D130N cells. Data shown are Firefly activity normalised to Renilla plotted as mean ± SEM derived from (n = 3) three independent experiments each consisting of three technical replicates. Error bars represent standard error of mean (SEM). One-way ANOVA and Dunnett’s multiple comparison test were used to compare polymerase activity in the GE cells with polymerase activity in WT cells. Unpaired two-tailed t-test was used to compare ANP32AN129I-D130N and ANP32AN129I-D130N +chA data. Statistical annotations are defined as *P ≤ 0.05, ****P ≤ 0.0001. d Image: wild-type (WT) hen (left) and homozygous ANP32AN129I-D130NGE hen (right, blue ring on right shank).Full size imageIAV polymerase activity is restricted in ANP32AN129I-D130N edited chicken cellsWe, and others, have previously shown that exogenously expressed chicken ANP32A variants containing either the N129I or D130N amino acid substitutions fail to complement avian influenza polymerase function in human cells or in chicken cells that lack wild-type ANP32A10, 13. Here, we directly assessed IAV polymerase activity in the ANP32AN129I-D130N edited chicken cells. We differentiated PGC lines harbouring the ANP32AN129I-D130N edit, or an edit designed to abrogate ANP32A expression by a small deletion in exon 1 (ANP32Aknockout) or WT PGCs into fibroblast-like cells, which are permissive for IAV replication and minigenome polymerase assays10, and assessed the activity of the reconstituted avian IAV polymerase (PB2 627E) or the human-adapted isoform (PB2 627 K) from three avian influenza A viruses: H9N2-UDL virus (A/chicken/Pakistan/UDL-1/2008, a low pathogenic virus of the predominant G1 lineage), H5N1 50-92 virus (Aurkey/England/50-92/1991, representing a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus with no record of zoonosis) and H5N1 Tky05 virus (Aurkey/Turkey/1/2005, a highly pathogenic avian virus that has frequently infected humans). All IAV polymerases were active in wild-type cells but inactive in either ANP32AN129I-D130N or ANP32Aknockout cells (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 6); exogenous expression of wild-type chicken ANP32A rescued polymerase activity in ANP32AN129I-D130N cells. These results confirm that the residues at position 129 and 130 of chicken ANP32A are key determinants of IAV polymerase activity in chicken cells.Generation of ANP32AN129I-D130N GE chickens using sterile surrogate hostsWe generated surrogate host chickens producing only gametes that harbour the ANP32AN129I-D130N edit through microinjection of male and female GE PGCs into iCaspase9 sterile host embryos (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 1)16. Subsequent mating of the mature surrogate host male and female chickens (Sire Dam Surrogate mating) generated homozygous ANP32AN129I-D130N eggs and chicks for analysis in a single generation (Supplementary Table 2). As ANP32A function is associated with the development of bone, cartilage, brain and heart in mouse models, we monitored the growth of ANP32AN129I-D130N chick embryos to identify any health or developmental defects17,18. We observed no developmental abnormalities in ANP32AN129I-D130N embryos and proceeded to hatch a small cohort of GE chicks consisting of seven ANP32AN129I-D130N chicks (generation G1 comprising 4 females and 3 males). In this preliminary experiment, we did not observe any differences in growth, external appearance, behaviour, or vaccination response in comparison to wild-type controls (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Figs. 7–9). All four ANP32AN129I-D130N hens began laying at 20 weeks of age and subsequent egg production was comparable to wild-type hens (5.75 eggs per hen/week measured over a 2-month period).ANP32AN129I-D130N chickens are resistant to low-dose IAV infectionTo assess the susceptibility of the GE chickens to IAV infection and transmission, 10 wild-type (WT) and 10 ANP32AN129I-D130N 2-week-old chickens were intranasally inoculated with 103 PFU of the low pathogenic avian influenza H9N2-UDL virus in separate isolators. (Fig. 2a). In all, 24 h post-inoculation, 10 naive WT sentinel birds were introduced into the WT isolator and 10 naive GE sentinel birds were introduced into the ANP32AN129I-D130N isolator to assess onward virus transmission. 4 directly inoculated birds and 4 sentinel birds were killed from each isolator on day 3 post-inoculation (pi) for post-mortem examination. Throughout the 14-day observation period, no clinical signs were observed in any birds and post-mortem analysis revealed no pathological lesions.Fig. 2: Assessment of low-dose IAV infection in ANP32AN129I-D130N chickens.a Schematic of low-dose in vivo challenge of 2-week-old chickens with H9N2-UDL influenza A virus (A/chicken/Pakistan/UDL01/08). Chickens were housed in negative pressure poultry isolators. Prior to challenge all birds were bled from the wing vein to obtain pre-infection sera. Groups of ten WT (black) chickens or ten ANP32AN129I-D130N (white) chickens were intranasally inoculated with 1 × 103 PFU of H9N2-UDL virus per bird. Uninoculated sentinel chickens were introduced into the isolators 24 h post infection to assess for transmission from the directly inoculated birds. Oropharyngeal cavities of each bird were swabbed daily from the day of inoculation (D0) until day 7 (D7) post-inoculation. Infectious virus titre in swabs was measured by plaque assay on MDCK cells (b, c). c Bird ID number for directly inoculated ANP32AN129I-D130N birds above the detection limit is indicated. DL detection limit of 10 PFU/ml for plaque assay.Full size imageAs the H9N2-UDL virus used in the challenge replicates predominantly in the respiratory tract of chickens, oropharyngeal swabs were collected from day 0 to day 7 pi to assess the shedding of infectious virus by plaque assay19. Infectious virus was detected consistently in all directly inoculated WT birds (10 of 10 birds) from day 1 pi until day 4 pi with daily mean titres above 3 × 104 PFU/ml, after which titres reduced and virus was cleared by day 6 pi (Fig. 2b). 7 of 10 co-housed WT sentinel birds acquired infection by the direct exposure route from the directly inoculated birds and shed virus from day 3 to day 6 post exposure (pe) (Fig. 2b).In contrast to the WT birds, oropharyngeal shedding of infectious virus was not detected in 9 of 10 directly inoculated ANP32AN129I-D130N birds. One bird (#5692) showed delayed shedding from day 4 pi to day 6 pi with low viral titres of 250 PFU/ml, 200 PFU/ml, and 50 PFU/ml respectively (Fig. 2c). None of the co-housed ANP32AN129I-D130N sentinel birds were infected (Fig. 2c), suggesting overall that the ANP32AN129I-D130N genotype confers resistance to naturally shed doses of IAV virus.To serologically confirm virus infection, blood samples were collected from all remaining birds on day 14 pi and analysed using the haemagglutination-inhibition (HI) assay to detect antibodies to the H9N2 IAV. All directly inoculated WT birds (6 of 6 birds) seroconverted with HI titres ranging from 128 to 2048 HI units (Supplementary Fig. 10a). All WT sentinel birds (6 of 6 birds) seroconverted and had HI titres equal or >128 HI units, confirming extensive virus transmission in the WT isolator. In contrast, the directly inoculated ANP32AN129I-D130N birds (5 of 6 birds) for which shedding was not observed did not seroconvert. Furthermore, the antibody titre in the single positive directly inoculated ANP32AN129I-D130N bird (#5692) was 64 HI units which corroborates the low level of oropharyngeal virus shedding observed in this bird. None of the ANP32AN129I-D130N sentinel birds (6 of 6 birds) seroconverted (Supplementary Fig. 10b).ANP32AN129I-D130N chickens display resilience to high-dose IAV infectionWe next assessed susceptibility and transmission following challenge with a higher dose of IAV. 10 WT and 10 ANP32AN129I-D130N 2-week-old chickens were intranasally inoculated with 106 PFU of H9N2-UDL virus per bird (Fig. 3a), 1000x the dose used in the first experiment. Sentinel chickens of both genotypes were introduced into each isolator 24 h post-inoculation to assess onward virus transmission (Fig. 3a). 4 ANP32AN129I-D130N and 8 WT sentinel birds were introduced into the WT isolator, while 4 WT and 8 ANP32AN129I-D130N birds were introduced into the ANP32AN129I-D130N isolator. 4 directly inoculated birds from each isolator and 4 sentinel birds of the same genotype were killed on day 3 pi or pe respectively for post-mortem examination. Despite the higher dose used for inoculation, no clinical signs or post-mortem pathological lesions were observed in any of the birds.Fig. 3: Assessment of high-dose IAV infection in ANP32AN129I-D130N chickens.a Schematic of high-dose in vivo challenge of 2-week-old chickens with H9N2-UDL influenza A virus (A/chicken/Pakistan/UDL01/08). Chickens were housed in negative pressure poultry isolators. Prior to challenge all birds were bled from the wing vein to obtain pre-infection sera. Groups of ten WT (black) chickens or ten ANP32AN129I-D130N (white) chickens were intranasally inoculated with 1 × 106 PFU of H9N2-UDL virus per bird. Uninoculated naive sentinel chickens were introduced into the isolators 24 h post challenge (day 1 pi) to assess for transmission from the directly inoculated birds. Oropharyngeal cavities of each bird were swabbed daily from the day of inoculation (day 0) until day 7 post inoculation. Infectious virus titre in swabs was measured by plaque assay (b, c). c Bird ID number for plaque-positive directly inoculated ANP32AN129I-D130N birds are indicated. Bird #941 was one of four directly inoculated ANP32AN129I-D130N birds culled on day 3 pi for post-mortem examination. DL detection limit of 10 PFU/ml for plaque assay.Full size imageAll WT birds were robustly infected and transmitted virus to all WT sentinels (Fig. 3b). Infectious virus was detected in swabs from directly inoculated WT chickens from day 1 pi until day 4 pi, peaking on day 2 pi, with a mean titre of 2.9 × 104 PFU/ml (Fig. 3b). All WT sentinel birds acquired infection and shed high titres of infectious virus (mean peak titre of 1.3 × 104 PFU/ml on day 2 pe)) from day 1 pe until day 5 or 6 pe (Fig. 3b). In contrast, none of the 4 ANP32AN129I-D130N birds housed in the WT isolator became infected suggesting they were resistant to infection by a naturally transmitted dose (Fig. 3b).Low-level and sporadic oropharyngeal shedding of infectious virus was observed in 5 of the 10 directly inoculated ANP32AN129I-D130N birds between day 2 pi and day 7 pi (Fig. 3c). 3 of the 10 directly inoculated ANP32AN129I-D130N birds (#941, #946 and #950) shed virus on day 2 and day 3 pi after which 4 birds, including bird #941, were randomly culled (Fig. 3c). Oropharyngeal shedding was subsequently observed in 2 other GE birds (#947 and #949) between day 4 and day 7 pi (Fig. 3c). The daily shed virus titres in infected directly inoculated ANP32AN129I-D130N birds were below 150 PFU/ml and generally more than 2 logs lower than that observed in WT birds except in a single bird (#941) which had a titre of 1.2 × 103 PFU/ml on day 2 pi. The median duration of infectious virus shedding by the 5 infected directly inoculated ANP32AN129I-D130N birds was 2 days compared to 4 days for the WT birds (Supplementary Fig. 11). The area-under-curve (AUC) of shed infectious virus was significantly reduced (p = 0.0018, two-tailed T-test) for directly inoculated ANP32AN129I-D130N birds (185.2 PFU/ml ± 264.7 PFU/ml SEM) compared to WT birds (5.9 × 104 PFU/ml ± 3.7 × 104 PFU/ml SEM) (Supplementary Fig. 12).Sporadic and low-level virus shedding from directly inoculated ANP32AN129I-D130N birds resulted in virus transmission to a single (1 of 4 birds) WT sentinel bird (bird #923), in which oropharyngeal virus shedding was detected on day 5 pe and day 6 pe (80 PFU/ml and 2000 PFU/ml, respectively) (Fig. 3c). None of 8 ANP32AN129I-D130N sentinel birds exposed to directly inoculated ANP32AN129I-D130N birds were infected, demonstrating lack of transmission between ANP32AN129I-D130N birds (Fig. 3c).Serology confirmed all infections that had been detected virologically. All directly inoculated WT birds and WT sentinel birds housed in the WT isolator seroconverted to the H9N2-UDL virus with HI assay titres ranging from 128 to 4096 HI units (Supplementary Fig. 13). In contrast, the HI assay titres for 3 of the 4 ANP32AN129I-D130N sentinels in the WT isolator was below the assay detection limit of 5 HI units, while the fourth ANP32AN129I-D130N sentinel had a low antibody titre of 32 HI units, however, infectious virus was not isolated from this bird. HI titres in the directly inoculated ANP32AN129I-D130N birds (ranging from 4 to 256 HI units) were significantly lower than in directly inoculated WT birds (ranging from 256 to 4096 HI units), reflecting a lower level of virus replication in these birds (Supplementary Fig. 13). Antibodies were not detected in sera from any of the 4 ANP32AN129I-D130N sentinels nor 3 of 4 WT sentinels in the ANP32AN129I-D130N isolator. The single infected WT sentinel bird (bird #923) in the ANP32AN129I-D130N isolator had a HI titre of 256 HI units.Overall, these results demonstrate that following inoculation with high titres of the H9N2-UDL virus, the ANP32AN129I-D130N genotype suppresses viral infection and significantly limits onward viral transmission to naive in-contact birds.Escape viruses contain mutations in their polymerase genes enabling support of virus replication by the edited ANP32A proteinTo determine whether any adaptive mutations had occurred during viral infection in ANP32AN129I-D130N chickens, oropharyngeal swabs were inoculated into WT chicken eggs to amplify sufficient viral material for sequencing. We sequenced viruses isolated from the 6 directly inoculated and infected ANP32AN129I-D130N chickens (birds #5692, #941, #946, #947, #949 and #950) and the single WT sentinel chicken (bird #923) that acquired infection from the infected GE birds. Comparative sequence analysis showed the presence of different constellations of non-synonymous changes in the polymerase genes and the NS gene that were not present in the isolates from wild-type birds and were not detected in the virus inoculum (Table 1). In all birds with breakthrough infections, mutations PA-E349K, PA-T639I or PB2-M631L were detected, sometimes in combination. In addition, various NS gene mutations and PB1 mutations were detected in isolates from later time points pi from 3 birds, always in combination with PA and/or PB2 mutations.Table 1 Amino acid substitutions at consensus level in viral isolates recovered from swabs of the oropharyngeal cavity of ANP32AN129I-D130N chickens and single infected WT sentinel chickenFull size tableTo assess the functional relevance of the dominant PA and PB2 mutations, we performed minigenome replication assays in ANP32A, B and E triple-knockout human cells, complementing polymerase function with expression of either wild-type chicken ANP32A (chANP32AWT) or the modified chicken ANP32A (chANP32AN129I-D130N) or the usually non-functional chicken ANP32B or E (chANP32B, chANP32E) proteins. Wildtype chicken ANP32A efficiently supported the activity of all the mutant IAV polymerases (Fig. 4a), indicating that these mutations did not diminish the interaction of wild-type ANP32A protein with the viral polymerase. As expected, chicken ANP32AN129I-D130N did not support the activity of the wild-type polymerase. However, chicken ANP32AN129I-D130N supported robust activity of polymerase harbouring the PA-E349K mutation alone, and when this PA mutation was combined with PB2-M631L, the polymerase activity with the edited chicken ANP32A protein was higher than with wild-type chicken ANP32A. The chicken ANP32AN129I-D130N protein also supported significant activity of polymerases with the combinations of PB2-M631L together with PA-T639I or PA-Q556R. Expression of chicken ANP32B or chicken ANP32E also supported very low levels of activity from the PB2 M631L-PA E349K polymerase (Fig. 4a).Fig. 4: Assessment of mutations identified in polymerase genes of viruses isolated from infected ANP32AN129I-D130N chickens.a, b Influenza A virus (H9N2-UDL) polymerase harbouring single or combinations of PA and PB2 mutations detected in virus isolated from ANP32AN129I-D130N chickens was reconstituted together with NP by plasmid transfection in eHAP1 human cells that lack ANP32 expression and complemented with chicken (a) or human (b) ANP32-FLAG proteins. Polymerase activity was measured at 24 h post-transfection by Firefly luciferase signal generated from a minireplicon and a Renilla luciferase transfection control. Data shown are Firefly activity normalised to Renilla plotted as mean ± SEM derived from three (n = 3) independent experiments, each consisting of three technical replicates.

The inoculated eggs were incubated at 37.5 °C. Allantoic fluids were collected at the indicated timepoints.

Statistical annotations are defined as ns not significant. d Human airway epithelial cells were infected with human-adapted H1N1 virus (A/England/195/2009) (England/195) or H9N2-UDLWT virus or H9N2-UDLPA-E349K PB2-M631L and incubated at 37.0 °C. Cell culture supernatants were harvested at the indicated timepoints and titrated by plaque assays. Data was statistically analysed by multiple unpaired two-sample T-test to compare growth of England/195 virus with growth of H9N2-UDLWT virus or H9N2-UDLPA-E349K PB2-M631L at each timepoint. Data was analysed by one-way ANOVA and Dunnett’s multiple comparison test. Statistical annotations are defined as *P ≤ 0.05, **P ≤ 0.01. e WT embryonated eggs were inoculated with 100 PFU of a mixture of H9N2-UDLWT and H9N2-UDLPA-E349K PB2-M631L virus containing <10% of the mutant virus. The inoculated eggs were incubated at 37.5 °C. Allantoic fluids were collected at the indicated timepoints and followed by viral RNA purification. Next generation sequencing was performed on purified viral RNA to determine variant frequency in each egg. f Human airway epithelial cells were infected with a mixture of H9N2-UDLWT virus and H9N2-UDLPA-E349K PB2-M631L virus containing <20% of the mutant virus and incubated at 37.0 °C. Cell culture supernatants were harvested at the indicated timepoints and followed by viral RNA purification. Next generation sequencing was performed on purified viral RNA to determine variant frequency at each timepoint. g, h Location of amino acids mutated in virus isolated from ANP32AN129I-D130N chickens in the asymmetric polymerase dimer in combination with chANP32A (PDB:6XZP) (g) or the symmetric polymerase dimer (PDB:6QXB) were plotted using ChimeraX (h). g Influenza virus asymmetric polymerase dimer (PDB: 6XZP) showing ANP32A in light green, amino acids 129 and 130 highlighted in purple, PB2-627K in red, PB2-M631L in orange, PA-E349K in yellow, PA-Q556R in dark green and PA-T691I in blue. h Influenza virus symmetric polymerase (PDB: 6QX8) showing PB2-627K in red, PB2-M631L in orange, PA-E349K in yellow, PA-Q556R in dark green and PA-T691I in blue.Full size imageSeveral of the polymerase mutations, PB2-M631L, PA-E349K and PA-Q556R, have previously been reported to enhance polymerase activity and replication of mouse-adapted human and avian IAVs20,21,22,23,24. PB2-M631L, PA-E349K and PA-Q556R mutations have been detected in IAVs in bird populations and often in avian viruses that infected humans, suggesting that they are human-adaptive mutations25. With this in mind, we tested whether they would also enable support of polymerase function by human ANP32A or ANP32B. This was the case as PB2-M631L and PA-E349K substitutions alone or in combination were almost as potent as the common PB2 mutation, E627K, at activating support of the avian influenza polymerase by the shorter mammalian ANP32 proteins in the minigenome replication assay (Fig. 4b).To understand the implications of the minigenome replication assay results in the context of whole virus, we generated a recombinant virus that harboured the PA-E349K and PB2-M631L mutations through reverse genetics (RG), and compared its replicative fitness with that of the isogenic RG wild-type H9N2-UDL virus in embryonated chicken eggs and in primary human airway epithelial (HAE) cells grown at air-liquid interface. We infected WT eggs with each virus and observed that viral yields were similar at 12-, 24- and 36-h timepoints (Fig. 4c). In primary cultures of HAE cells, individual growth curves also showed no difference in replication at 24-, 48- and 72-h timepoints (Fig. 4d).Subsequently, we co-infected WT eggs with RG wild-type and double mutant PA-E349K PB2-M631L viruses to assess the competitive fitness of the mutant virus. A minority input of the double mutant virus (<10%) was used to see if it would outcompete the wild-type virus. The double mutant maintained a frequency of 5-10% throughout, demonstrating that the polymerase mutations provided neither a fitness advantage nor a defect (Fig. 4e), in line with their equal activity supported by wild-type chANP32A in the polymerase assay (Fig. 4a). However, in human airway epithelial cultures, a higher original input of <20% double mutant genomes became enriched to approximately 50% of the virus population by 48 h post-infection demonstrating a subtle replicative advantage (Fig. 4f), also in line with the enhanced support of the mutant polymerase by human ANP32A and B proteins in the polymerase assay (Fig. 4b). It is important to note that polymerase gene mutations alone are not sufficient to adapt an avian influenza virus to humans. A major species barrier for avian influenza also exists at the level of cell binding and entry that is determined by the virus haemagglutinin protein, HA. Adaptations in HA are absolutely required for efficient infection and onwards transmission in humans1. Thus, despite the double mutant H9N2-UDL virus demonstrating a minor fitness advantage over wild-type virus in the HAE competition model, its replication was still 2–3 orders of magnitude lower in human airway cells than that of a human-adapted virus, A/England/195/2009(H1N1), at all timepoints in head-to-head growth kinetics (Fig. 4d).Most polymerase mutations that arose in ANP32AN129I-D130N edited birds are distal to the interface with ANP32 amino acids 129 and 130 in the polymerase/ANP32 complex structureTo assess the structural context of the mutations identified in viral isolates from breakthrough infections, we mapped the location of the substituted amino acids in the polymerase subunits to the published structure of the asymmetric influenza C virus (ICV) polymerase dimer in complex with chicken ANP32A12 (Fig. 4g). Chicken ANP32A residues N129 and D130 sit on the edge of the fifth leucine-rich repeat domain (LRR5) of ANP32A. One of the polymerase substitutions, PA-T639I, is located in a region of PA in the encapsidating polymerase opposite LRR5 but is not a contact residue with amino acids 129 or 130 in the ICV complex. Another of the PA substitutions, at amino acid 556 is also situated in the encapsidating polymerase in the vicinity of the central region of ANP32A essential for supporting polymerase activity10,26. The PB2 residue 631 is located close to the prototypic host-range determining residue 627 and within the PB2-627 domain which is thought to interact with the unstructured LCAR of ANP32A27. However, neither of these PA substitutions or PB2 M631L on their own enabled use of the edited ANP32AN129I-D130N (Fig. 4a).In contrast, the PA substitution E349K, which had the largest effect on polymerase activity, is not located in any polymerase region interacting with the host ANP32A protein in the solved asymmetric dimer complex (Fig. 4g)12. However, influenza virus polymerase also forms an alternative symmetric dimer required for the replication of the vRNA genome from a cRNA template, a part of the replication cycle functionally associated with ANP32 proteins, although currently no structure of this dimer in complex with the host protein exists28,29. Interestingly, three PA amino acids associated with the breakthrough viruses, 345, 349 and 556, are located on the interface of this symmetric dimer (Fig. 4h)29,30. How mutations that affect the symmetric dimer might compensate for suboptimal ANP32 proteins to support replication is not currently understood. Since the polymerase in infected cells exists as at least two different conformations, mutations that destabilise one might enable formation of the other even under suboptimal conditions23.The PA-349K PB2-M631L double mutant H9N2-UDL escape virus can replicate in chicken embryos lacking ANP32AApparently, H9N2-UDL virus adapted in vivo to utilise the edited ANP32AN129I-D130N protein. We asked whether complete removal of ANP32A would eliminate viral escape. We generated male and female surrogate host chickens producing gametes derived from injected PGCs containing a large loss-of-function deletion in ANP32A (AKO) (Fig. 5a, Supplementary Fig. 14)16. Mating of these surrogate chickens generated homozygous ANP32A-knockout (AKO) eggs and chicks in a single generation. We monitored the development of the AKO chick embryos and observed no developmental defects. We hatched a small cohort of sixteen AKO chicks (generation G1 comprising 9 females and 7 males) and did not observe any differences in external appearance, behaviour, internal anatomy, or lay rate (6.22 eggs per hen/week AKO hens; 6.71 eggsper hen/week WT hens) in comparison to wild-type (WT) controls. However, AKO chicks weighed slightly less than wild-type chicks, possibly due to a difference in initial egg size in the WT and AKO eggs (Supplementary Fig. 15).Fig. 5: Deletion of ANP32 A, B, and E eliminates viral polymerase activity and viral proliferation.a ANP32A deletion strategy: two gRNAs were used to generate a 15-kb deletion in ANP32A in male and female PGCs. Clonal lines of ANP32A-knockout (AKO) PGCs were isolated, propagated and injected into iCaspase9 host embryos which were incubated to hatch. After hatching, the surrogate hosts were raised to sexual maturity and directly mated. All offspring from eggs laid by the surrogate hosts were biallelic for ANP32A deletion (see Supplementary Fig. 14). b, c WT or ANP32AN129I-D130N or AKO 11-day-old embryonated eggs were inoculated with wild-type H9N2-UDL (H9N2-UDLWT) virus or the double mutant variant (H9N2-UDLPA-E349K PB2-M631L) containing the PA-E349K and PB2-M631L mutations. The inoculated eggs were incubated at 37.5 °C. Allantoic fluids were collected 48 h later and PFU/ml measured by plaque assay. DL detection limit of plaque assay (10 PFU/ml).

PGCs were subsequently differentiated into fibroblast –like cells and used to assay polymerase activity and viral replication. e Wildtype (WT) H9N2-UDL polymerase or the mutant isoform harbouring PA-E349K and PB2-M631L mutations was reconstituted together with NP by plasmid transfection into chicken PGC-derived fibroblast-like cells. Polymerase activity was measured at 48 h post-transfection by detection of Firefly luciferase signal generated from a minireplicon normalised to a Renilla luciferase transfection control. Data shown are Firefly activity normalised to Renilla plotted as mean ± SEM derived from three (n = 3) independent experiments, each consisting of three technical replicates.

Cell culture supernatants were harvested at the indicated timepoints and titrated by plaque assays. Data was statistically analysed by one-way ANOVA and Dunnett’s multiple comparison test to compare virus growth in wild-type cells with virus growth in other cell types at each timepoint. Statistical annotations are defined as ns=not significant, *P ≤ 0.05, **P ≤ 0.01, ***P ≤ 0.001, ****P ≤ 0.0001.Full size imageWe assessed the robustness of the AKO edit by infecting 11-day-old embryonated chicken eggs which are highly permissive to influenza infection. First, we inoculated ANP32AN129I-D130N GE eggs with 100 PFU of wild-type H9N2-UDL (H9N2-UDLWT) virus and observed a low level of viral growth in all GE eggs (Fig. 5b). Sequencing of the virus again revealed polymerase mutations (PA-G634E, PA-K635E, PA-K635Q, PB2-G74S, PB1-F185L) in viruses isolated from the ANP32AN129I-D130N GE embryonated eggs. This further confirmed that the N129I-D130N substitution in chicken ANP32A does not completely abrogate virus replication and leads to IAV escape and evolution. In contrast, infection of AKO eggs with 100 PFU of H9N2-UDLWT virus led to no viral replication. Following inoculation with 1000 PFU of H9N2-UDLWT, 2/5 AKO eggs supported a low level of replication (Fig. 5c). In contrast, the H9N2-UDL escape double mutant virus replicated in AKO eggs following inoculation at both low (100 PFU) or high (1000 PFU) doses (Fig. 5c). This was also the case for the single E349K mutant virus and an independent sample of double mutant virus derived from a plaque pick from the original chicken isolate (Supplementary Fig. 16). Together these data indicate that even the entire deletion of chicken ANP32A is not sufficient to abrogate IAV mutant infections of chicken.IAV WT and mutants do not replicate in chicken cells lacking ANP32A, B, and EWe and others previously reported that neither chicken ANP32B nor chicken ANP32E supports IAV polymerase even for viruses with mammalian adapting mutations10, 11,13. However, we reasoned that the E349K-M631L double mutant virus that replicated in AKO eggs (Fig. 5c) may have adapted to use another member of the ANP32 protein family. Indeed, the minireplicon assay had revealed significant but very low activity supported by chANP32B or chANP32E (Fig. 4a). To investigate this possibility, we targeted chicken PGCs to generate cell lines containing concurrent loss-of-expression mutations in ANP32A and ANP32B (AKO/BKO cell line) or in ANP32A and ANP32E (AKO/EKO cell line) or in all three ANP32 proteins (TKO cell line) (Fig. 5d and Supplementary Fig. 17). Minireplicon assays indicated that the activity of the H9N2-UDL double mutant polymerase was significantly reduced but detectable in chicken cells lacking only ANP32A (AKO cells), and also in chicken cells expressing only ANP32E (AKO/BKO cells) (Fig. 5e). Importantly, polymerase activity was completely absent in TKO cells lacking all three ANP32 proteins.Since other viral proteins such as NS1 and NEP are not expressed in minireplicon assays but have effects on polymerase activity and can compensate for defective replication, we tested whether the TKO cells remained resilient to virus replication even when these other viral products were present31,32,33. We first attempted to perform replication assays in TKO cells using the wild type and double mutant H9N2-UDL virus, however, H9N2 viral replication in in vitro cell lines was extremely low. We therefore infected the edited cells with a PR8 recombinant virus harbouring the polymerase and other internal genes from the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus Aurkey/Turkey/1/2005 (Tky05). Virus replication was evident by 48 h post infection in wild type and all edited cells except the TKO line which yielded no infectious virus even after 120 h incubation (Fig. 5f). Finally, we infected the set of edited cell lines with a representative of the contemporary highly pathogenic H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b viruses, and confirmed complete absence of replication in the TKO cells (Fig. 5g). Taken together, our result implies that single edits or deletions of single ANP32 proteins is not sufficient to generate influenza resistant birds but that edits of all three members of the ANP32 family will be needed.DiscussionBreeding for resistance and resilience to disease has significant potential in farmed poultry34,35. The production of transgenic chickens that expressed an RNA decoy that inhibits the IAV polymerase and prevented onward viral transmission to neighbouring birds was the first demonstration that genetic engineering could be used to introduce resistance to infectious diseases in chicken36. With recent advances in the development of genome editing technology, novel resistanceesilience alleles can now be introduced into chicken populations by editing host genes essential for pathogenic infections to specifically abrogate their pro-viral functions37.Here we introduced a specific gene edit to the host protein ANP32A that had been shown to abrogate its support for the influenza polymerase in cell culture10,13. GE birds carrying this edit showed no adverse health or productivity effects and were resistant to IAV infection by a natural transmission route following exposure to other infected birds. Thus, our data show the promise of this strategy for mitigating the incursion of avian influenza into farmed poultry from wild bird sources. Even following a direct inoculation with 103 infectious virus particles, only a single bird was infected and the viral titres shed were low and transient, and no onwards transmission occurred. However, following direct inoculation with a higher dose, breakthrough infection occurred in the GE birds. Influenza virus is notorious for its ability to evolve, and we detected a series of different amino acid substitutions in the viral polymerase genes of viruses isolated from the GE chickens that had enabled adaptation of the enzyme to co-opt support from the edited ANP32A protein, and also to utilise otherwise suboptimal ANP32 family members. These mutations unexpectedly allowed the usually host-restricted avian influenza polymerase to use the shorter human ANP32A and B and thus partially adapted the viral polymerase for replication in mammals. Although unintended, this consequence clearly indicates the importance of a robust genome editing strategy and subsequent appraisal that includes challenge with multiple avian influenza genotypes at non-physiological exposure levels to rule out the opportunity for adaptive viral evolution.We further generated chickens that entirely lacked expression of ANP32A, but the wild-type virus still replicated at low levels in some of the eggs, and the mutant virus was only marginally restricted. Finally, we edited all three members of the ANP32 family to generate chicken cells lacking their expression, and found no virus polymerase activity, even of the mutant polymerase, and no breakthrough infection in these cells. This combination of knockouts is expected to be deleterious to the animals’ health, but illustrates a proof of principle that multiple edits in host genes could be combined to confer sterile resistance. Indeed, editing of the three ANP32 genes will be futile if increased resistance to Avian Influenza is accompanied by any loss in fitness of the birds; for example effects on development, weight gain or fecunidity, and/or increased susceptibility to other avian pathogens.Future assessment of GE animals, after the research phase of their development and prior to their distribution, should take into account whether appropriate investigatory steps have been carried out to evaluate if genome-edited livestock might drive pathogen evolution. This is especially relevant for pathogens with zoonotic potential as was shown here. We suggest that a suitable strategy for generating avian influenza resistant chickens will require multiple edits that destroy the pro-viral potential of ANP32A, B and E to eliminate the likelihood that escape mutants can arise.MethodsAnimalsFertile eggs were obtained from commercial Hy-line layer flocks bred at the National Avian Research Facility, Midlothian, United Kingdom. All chicken lines were bred and maintained under UK Home Office License. All experiments and procedures were performed in accordance with relevant UK Home Office regulations. Experimental protocols and studies were reviewed by the Roslin Institute Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Board (AWERB) Committee, GM and Biological Safety Committee and performed under Home Office Licence (PP9565661). All animal challenge work was approved and regulated by the UK government Home Office under the project license (P68D44CF4) and reviewed by the Pirbright Animal Welfare and Ethics Review Board (AWERB). All personnel involved in the procedures were licensed by the UK Home Office. All procedures were performed in accordance with these guidelines and the study is reported in line with the ARRIVE guidelines.PGC derivation and culturePGC lines were derived from individual fertile eggs, cultured in FAOT medium and expanded to 400,000 cells in 5 weeks before performing gene editing experiments38. Fertile eggs bred from Hy-line layer lines were incubated for 2.5 days and then 1 μl of embryonic blood was taken from the dorsal aorta of HH stage 16 HH embryos and placed into FAOT medium. FAOT medium contains custom-made Avian Knockout DMEM (Life Technologies #041-96570 M) 1× B-27 supplement (Life Technologies #17504044), 2.0 mM GlutaMax (Life Technologies #35050-038), 1× non-essential amino acids (Life Technologies #11140050), 1× EmbryoMax nucleosides (Merck Millipore #ES-008-D), 0.1 mM β-mercaptoethanol (Life Technologies #31350010), 0.2% ovalbumin (Sigma-Aldrich A5503), 1.2 mM sodium pyruvate (Life Technologies #11360070), 0.15 mM CaCl2, 0.01% sodium heparin, 4 ng/ml h-FGF2 (R&D Systems), 50 ng/ml ovotransferrin (Sigma-Aldrich C7786) and 25 ng/ml activin A (Peprotech). PGCs were grown at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere and fed every 48 h.CRISPR Plasmids and ssODN donorPX458-mcherry, PX458-GFP, PX459 V2.0 and HF-PX459 V 2.0 vectors were used for expression of CRISPR/Cas914,15,39. PX458-mcherry was a gift from Joanna Wysocka (Addgene plasmid # 161974). PX458 was a gift from Feng Zhang (Addgene plasmid # 48138). PX459 V2.0 vector was a gift from Feng Zhang (Addgene plasmid # 62988). gRNA sequences were selected using CHOPCHOP gRNA design web tool (http://chopchop.cbu.uib.no/) which also generated potential off-target sites for the selected gRNA40. gRNA oligonucleotides were synthesised by Invitrogen and inserted into PX459 V2.0 and HF-PX459 V2.0 vectors using methods previously described14. Short single-stranded oligonucleotide DNA (ssODN) donor was an Ultramer® DNA Oligonucleotide synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT). gRNA and ssODN sequences are listed in Supplementary Table 3.PGC gene editing and DNA sequencingTo generate ANP32AN129I-D130N cells, PGCs were transiently transfected with 1.5 µg of PX459 V2.0 CRISPR/Cas9 vector and 10 µM of ssODN donor using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies) to target exon 4 of ANP32A. This was followed by treatment with 0.1 mg/ml puromycin (Sigma-Aldrich #P7255) to enrich for transfected cells15. To generate ANP32Aknockout cells, chicken PGCs were transiently transfected with 2.0 µg of PX459 V2.0 CRISPR/Cas9 vector using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent to target exon 1 of ANP32A10. To generate the AKO genotype containing a 15-kb loss-of-function deletion in ANP32A, chicken PGCs were transiently transfected with 1.5 µg of PX459 V2.0 CRISPR/Cas9 vector to target exon 1 and intron 5 of ANP32A and followed by treatment with 0.1 mg/ml puromycin (Sigma-Aldrich #P7255) to enrich for transfected cells15. Single cell cultures of puromycin-selected cells were subsequently established to isolate clonal populations of homozygous gene-edited PGCs for downstream experiments as described previously15. Briefly, PGCs were seeded at 1 cell per well in 110 µl FAOT medium in 96-well plates using a FACS Aria III machine (BD Biosciences) and subsequently cultured for 2 to 3 weeks when cell density will reach 30 to 50%. The PGC cultures were then transferred to 48-well plates and subsequently into 24-well plates for further expansion for downstream experiments. Alternatively to generate the AKO genotype, PGCs were transiently transfected with 1.5 µg each of PX458-GFP and PX458-mcherry CRISPR/Cas9 vectors to target exon 1 and intron 5 of ANP32A and followed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) 48 h later to establish single cell cultures to isolate clonal populations of homozygous gene-edited PGCs. To generate the BKO genotype containing a 134-bp loss-of-function deletion in ANP32B, PGCs were transiently transfected with 1.5 µg each of PX458-GFP and PX458-mcherry CRISPR/Cas9 vectors to target the promoter region and exon 1 of ANP32B, followed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) 48 h later to establish single cell cultures to isolate clonal populations of homozygous gene-edited PGCs. To generate the EKO genotype containing a 160-bp loss-of-function deletion in ANP32E, PGCs were transiently transfected with 1.5 µg each of PX458-GFP and PX458-mcherry CRISPR/Cas9 vectors to target exon 2 and intron 2 of ANP32E, followed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) 48 h later to establish single cell cultures to isolate clonal populations of homozygous gene-edited PGCs. To generate the AKO/BKO (containing concurrent loss-of-function deletions in ANP32A and ANP32B) and AKO/EKO genotypes (containing concurrent loss-of-function deletions in ANP32A and ANP32E), BKO PGCs and EKO PGCs were respectively transiently transfected with 1.5 µg each of PX458-GFP and PX458-mcherry CRISPR/Cas9 vectors to target exon 1 and intron 6 of ANP32A and followed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) 48 h later to establish single cell cultures to isolate clonal populations of homozygous gene-edited PGCs. To generate the TKO genotype (containing concurrent loss-of-function deletions in ANP32A, ANP32B and ANP32E), AKO/BKO PGCs were transiently transfected with 1.5 µg each of PX458-GFP and PX458-mcherry CRISPR/Cas9 vectors to target exon 2 and intron 2 of ANP32E, followed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) 48 h later to establish single cell cultures to isolate clonal populations of homozygous gene-edited PGCs.To screen for ANP32AN129I-D130N cells, single-cell clones were analysed by PCR amplification of genomic DNA and Sanger sequencing using primers (5′–AGAGGAAGGGAGCAAAAGTCA–3′, 5′–ATGCTTGTCTTCCTCCTTCCA–3′). To screen for ANP32Aknockout cells containing targeting of exon 1 only, single cell clones were analysed by PCR amplification of genomic DNA and then cloning of the PCR products into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega), followed by Sanger sequencing using T7 promoter forward primer. To screen for the AKO genotype, single-cell clones were analysed by PCR amplification of genomic DNA and Sanger sequencing using primers (5′–TCAAAGTCCCTTATTACCGCG–3′, 5′–CCTTTCACTCCCCATCTTTCA–3′) that bind to areas outside the deleted 15-kb region and amplify a PCR product of approximately 220 bp only if the deletion is successful but will fail to yield a product if there is no deletion. To screen for the BKO genotype, single-cell clones were analysed by PCR amplification of genomic DNA and Sanger sequencing using primers (5′–GGTGCCATTTTGTCGAGGG–3′, 5′–CTCTCCAGGCTTCTTGTTGC–3′) overlapping the deleted region. To screen for the EKO genotype, single-cell clones were analysed by PCR amplification of genomic DNA and Sanger sequencing using primers (5′–ATGTCATGGAGGCGCAGT–3′, 5′–CCCCAAATCAGTAAAAGCCCC–3′) overlapping the deleted region. PCR primers used for amplification of selected off-target sites are detailed in Supplementary Table 4. PCR gel electrophoresis data was collected using the NuGenius Gel documentation system (Syngene). Sequencing data was viewed and analysed using SeqMan Pro 17 and MegAlign Pro 17 (Lasergene 17, DNASTAR) or SnapGene Version 6.2.1(Dotmatics).PGC transcriptome analysisIn all, 200,000 PGCs were expanded in FAOT culture medium to 2 × 106 cells. PGCs were subsequently pelletised by centrifugation, resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then pelletised again. RNA was purified from the washed cell pellet using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen 74104) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA concentration was measured using the NanoDrop® Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific ND-1000). RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit (Agilent Technologies 5067-1511) and the 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies G2939BA). All the RNA samples used in RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) had an RNA integrity number (RIN) ranging from 8.0 to 10.0.cDNA libraries were constructed by the Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI, Hong Kong, China). Briefly, poly-A containing mRNA molecules were purified using poly-T oligo-attached magnetic beads (New England Biolabs) that were subsequently fragmented into shorter mRNA fragments using divalent cations under an elevated temperature (Ambion® RNA fragmentation reagents kit, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Reverse transcriptase and a random primer (Invitrogen) were then used to synthesise First-strand cDNA from the cleaved RNA fragments. Second strand cDNA synthesis proceeded with a DNA Polymerase I (New England Biolabs) and RNase H (Invitrogen), and the RNA template was removed. An ‘A’ base was added to the resulting cDNA fragments, that was subsequently ligated to an adapter. Finally, the products were enriched by PCR before purification with the MinElute PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen). This purified cDNA library was used in RNA-Seq analysis.RNA-seq reads were generated by BGI using the Illumina Novaseq 6000 system. Following sequencing, initial analysis was conducted by BGI using SOAPnuke software (developed by BGI) to filter the raw sequence reads using the following parameters: - n 0.01 -l 20 -q 0.4 -A 0.25 --cutAdaptor -Q 2 -G --polyX 50 --minLen 150 -i. An entire read was removed if 25% of its sequence matched the adaptor sequence. To filter low-quality data, an entire read was removed if more than 50% of its bases had a quality value lower than 20. Also, an entire read was deleted if the frequency of unknown bases was greater than 5%. The remaining filtered reads (over 78 million per sample), defined as ‘clean reads’ were stored in FASTQ format. FASTQ files were imported into the CLC Genomics Workbench v20.0.4 (Qiagen) for quality-control processing and analysis. RNA-seq data are deposited in the GEO and SRA archives at NCBI (Accession number GSE182397).RNA-seq read mapping and DEG analysis was performed as previously described41,42. Briefly, RNA-seq reads were subjected to quality trimming before mapping to the ENSEMBL galGal5-annotated assembly (GRCg6a; 15-12-2020) for alignment and quantitative analysis of expression using the ‘RNA-Seq Analysis’ tool of the CLC Genomics Workbench (CLC Bio v2.18). For quantitative analysis, trimmed mean of M-values normalization (TMM) of the trimmed data set was performed by filtering out genes showing zero or NaN expression values. The fold change and False Discovery Rates (Bonferroni) were calculated using the RNA-Seq Analysis tool while differential expression within the RNA-Seq data was analysed using the Differential Expression for RNA-Seq tool of the CLC Genomic Workbench (CLC Bio v2.2). HEAT Maps were generated from TMM-normalised samples using the ‘Create HEAT Map for RNA-Seq’ tool in the same suite, using Euclidean Distance and Complete Cluster Linkage. Principal component analysis (PCA) plots were generated from the TMM-normalised samples using the ‘PCA for RNA-Seq’ tool in the same suite.Generation of GE chickensMale and female GE PGCs were micro-injected separately into stage 15-16+ HH (ED 2.5) surrogate iCaspase9 host embryos as described previously16. Briefly, 1.0 µl of 25 mM B/B compound (in DMSO) (Takara Bio) was added to a 50 µl cell suspension (5000 PGCs/µl) and maintained at room temperature. ANP32AN129I-D130N: one male (FR5M#7) or three female (FR3F#3, FR3F#40 and FR6F#10) clonal GE PGC lines. 1.0 µl of the B/B compound-PGC mixture was injected into the dorsal aorta of embryos in windowed eggs. Egg shells were sealed with medical Leukosilk tape (BSN Medical) and then incubated until hatch. Surrogate males and female chickens (G0) were mated in pens to produce homozygous GE offspring. To screen for homozygous ANP32AN129I-D130N embryos or chicks, chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) (for embryos) or CAM and blood (from hatchlings) were analysed by PCR amplification of genomic DNA and Sanger sequencing using primers (5′–ACTCCTTTTGTCACGAGAAGC–3′, 5′–TTCCTCCTCATCGTCTAAGCC–3′). To screen for homozygous AKO embryos, CAM were analysed by PCR amplification of genomic DNA and Sanger sequencing using primers (5′– TCAAAGTCCCTTATTACCGCG–3′, 5′–CCTTTCACTCCCCATCTTTCA–3′) that bind to areas outside the deleted 15-kb region and amplify a PCR product of approximately 220 bp only if the deletion is successful but fail to yield a product if there is no deletion. GE chickens received routine vaccinations and blood samples were sent to Sci-Tech Labs (Cawood Scientific), Dublin, Ireland to perform ELISA tests to assess response to vaccines.Western blot analysisTo analyse ANP32A expression in gene-edited clonal lines (Supplementary Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 17k), at least 150,000 cells were lysed in 50 µl of 1X RIPA lysis buffer (sc-24948, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitor (Halt, Thermo Scientific 78440) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. To analyse ANP32A expression in AKO embryos (Supplementary Fig. 14g), approximately 2 mg of embryonic tissue was lysed in 100 µl of 1X RIPA lysis buffer (sc-24948, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitor (Halt, Thermo Scientific 78440) according to the manufacturers’ instruction. Denaturing electrophoresis and western blotting were performed using the NuPAGE electrophoresis system (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Immunoblotting was performed using the following primary antibodies; rabbit anti-ANP32A (Sigma-Aldrich AV40203; 1/1000 dilution) and mouse anti-ɣ-tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich TS6557; 1/1000 dilution). The following secondary antibodies were used: goat anti-mouse IRDye 800CW (LI-COR 925-32211; 1/10,000 dilution) and goat anti-rabbit IRDye 680RD (LI-COR 925-68070; 1/10,000 dilution). Protein bands were visualised through fluorescence using the Odyssey Imaging System (LI-COR) according to the manufacturer’s instruction.PGC differentiation into adherent fibroblast-like cells150,000 PGCs were incubated in 500 µl of high calcium FAOT medium containing 1.8 mM CaCl2 in fibronectin-coated or gelatin-coated wells in 24-well plates for 48 h. Subsequently, the FAOT medium was replaced with PGC fibroblast cell culture medium and then refreshed every 48 h by taking out 300 µl and adding back 300 µl of PGC fibroblast medium. Adherent fibroblast-like cells were visible with 48 h of culture in PGC fibroblast medium. Cell culture medium was refreshed every 48 h and cells were split 1:3 once they are reached 85-90% confluency in 24-well plates. PGC fibroblast-like cell culture medium contains 10% ES-grade foetal bovine serum (Life Technologies #16141061), 1% chicken serum (Biosera #CH-515), 0.1% 100x NEAA (Life Technologies #11140050), 0.1% sodium pyruvate (Life Technologies #11360070), 0.1% 100x GlutaMax (Life Technologies #35050-038), and 50 ng/ml ovotransferrin (Sigma-Aldrich C7786) in Knockout DMEM (Life Technologies #10829018). PGC fibroblast cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere.Cells and cell cultureMadin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells (ATCC) were maintained in cell culture medium containing Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS) (Life Technologies) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Life Technologies) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. ANP32A-ANP32B-ANP32E-triple-knockout human eHAP1 cells (Horizon Discovery) lacking ANP32 expression were generated by Dr Ecco Staller at the University of Oxford9 and maintained in Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s medium (Thermo Fisher) supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% nonessential amino acids (Life Technologies), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.Minigenome replication assayInfluenza polymerase activity was assessed by using the chicken polI minigenome system as described previously8,10,43. pCAGGS expression plasmids encoding each polymerase component and NP for H5N1 50–92, H5N1 ty/05 and H9N2-UDL are described previously8,43. To measure influenza polymerase activity, PGC fibroblasts were transfected using Lipofectamine LTX (Invitrogen) according to manufacturers’ instructions in 24-well plates with pCAGGS plasmids encoding the PB1 (100 ng), PB2 (100 ng), PA (100 ng) and NP (100 ng) proteins, together with 100 ng chicken-specific minigenome reporter, either Empty pCAGGS or pCAGGS expressing chicken ANP32A (100 ng) and, as an internal control, 100 ng Renilla luciferase expression plasmid (pCAGGS-Renilla). Cells were incubated at 37 °C, and 48 h after transfection, cells were lysed with 120 ml of passive lysis buffer (Promega). Firefly and Renilla luciferase bioluminescence were measured using a Dual-luciferase system (Promega) with an EG&G Berthold LB 96 Microplate Luminometer or a Cytation 3 plate reader (Agilent-BioTek).To assess polymerase activity in ANP32A-ANP32B-ANP32E-triple-knockout eHAP1 cells, cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen) in 24-wells with pCAGGS expression plasmids encoding H9N2-UDL PB1 (0.04 µg), PB2 (0.04 µg), PA (0.02 µg), NP (0.08 µg), chicken or human-specific Firefly minigenome reporter (0.08 µg) and Renilla luciferase expression plasmid (0.04 µg) together with chicken ANP32-FLAG or human ANP32-FLAG or empty expression plasmid (0.04 µg) and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Cells were subsequently lysed in 50 µl passive lysis buffer (Promega) for 30 min with gentle shaking at room temperature. Firefly and Renilla bioluminescence were measured using the dual-luciferase system (Promega) with a FLUOstar Omega plate reader (BMG Labtech).In vivo challenge of chickens with influenza virus and transmission to naïve sentinelsMixed sex commercial Hy-line layer chickens (WT and ANP32AN129I-D130N) were hatched at the National Avian Research Facility, Midlothian, United Kingdom and transported at 1 day of age to The Pirbright Institute, Surrey, UK. Pre-infection sera were obtained from all chickens, and all were negative for reactive influenza antibodies against A/chicken/Pakistan/UDL01/08 (H9N2-UDL) by haemagglutinin inhibition assay (HI). Chickens were housed in two groups according to genotype, WT or ANP32AN129I-D130N. At 7 days of age, chickens to be directly inoculated were housed in negative pressured BioFlex® B50 Rigid Body Poultry isolators (Bell Isolation Systems). At 2 weeks of age, chickens in isolators were inoculated intranasally with 100 μl (50 μl per nare) of H9N2-UDL virus, either at a low dose of virus (1 × 103 PFU) or high dose (1 × 106 PFU). 24 h after direct inoculation, naïve sentinel birds were introduced into the isolators to assess transmission. Numbers of birds involved in each experiment are detailed in Figs. 2 and 3. 14 days post-inoculation, birds were humanely euthanised by intravenous administration of sodium pentobarbital, blood was collected by cardiac puncture and sera collected for analysis of virus-specific antibodies by HI. Infection of birds was assessed by swabbing both the oropharyngeal and cloacal cavities daily with sterile polyester tipped swabs (Fisher Scientific, UK) which were transferred into viral transport media, vortexed briefly, clarified and stored at −80 °C prior to virus detection44.Plaque assayInfectious virus titration was by plaque assay on MDCK cells. MDCKs were inoculated with 10-fold serially diluted samples and overlaid with 2% agarose (Oxoid) in supplemented DMEM (1× MEM, 0.21% BSA V, 1 mM L-Glutamate, 0.15% Sodium Bicarbonate, 10 mM Hepes, 1× Penicillin/Streptomycin (all Gibco) and 0.01% Dextran DEAE (Sigma-Aldrich, Inc.), with 2 µg/ml TPCK trypsin (SIGMA). MDCKs were then incubated at 37 °C for 72 h. Plaques were developed using crystal violet stain containing methanol. The limit of virus detection in the plaque assays was 5 pfu/ml.Haemagglutination inhibition assayHaemagglutinin inhibition (HI) assays were carried out using the challenge virus H9N2-UDL. HI assays were performed according to standard procedures45. Samples with titres below 2 HI units were considered negative.Sequencing of viruses isolated from chicken oropharyngeal swabsTo sequence viruses recovered from directly inoculated and sentinel chickens, 100 µl of clarified oropharyngeal swab sample was inoculated into embryonic day (ED) 10 chicken eggs (Valo BioMedia GmbH) and incubated at 37 °C with turning for 72 h before allantoic fluid was harvested. Viral RNA was extracted from allantoic fluid using RNA extracted from each concentration, using the QIAmp viral RNA minikit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer instructions and virus cDNA produced using SuperScript IV (Invitogen) RT-PCR using the universal primer Optil-R1: GTT ACG CGC CAG TAG AAA CAA GG according to the manufacturer’s instructions. PCR amplification of all eight influenza A virus segments was achieved by PCR with a mixture of three universal primers (Optil-F1: GTT ACG CGC CAG CAA AAG CAG G, Optil-F2: GTT ACG CGC CAG CGA AAG CAG G and Optil-R1: GTT ACG CGC CAG TAG AAA CAA GG) and Q5® High-fidelity DNA polymerase (NEB). 1 ng of dsDNA was used to prepare sequencing libraries using the Nextera XT DNA kit (Illumina). Pooled libraries were sequenced on a 2x300cycle MiSeq Reagent Kit v2 (Illumina, USA) and analysed using Geneious Prime 2019 software (Biomatters Inc.).Human airway epithelial cell infectionTriplicate wells of primary human airway epithelial (HAE) cells (purchased from Epithelix Sarl, Inc) at an air–liquid interface were washed apically with 200 µl serum-free DMEM (Gibco) to remove mucus before being infected with 0.01 PFU/cell of virus for 1 hr. Inoculum was removed and the apical surface washed twice. At timepoints post-infection 200 µl serum-free DMEM was added to the apical surface and removed after 10 mins at 37 °C to take harvests for plaque assay or variant quantification for competition assay.Competition assay between UDL WT and mutant virusesChicken eggs (n = 4) or human airway epithelial cell inserts (n = 3) were co-infected with a mixture of viruses and harvests taken at timepoints post-infection. Viral RNA was extracted using MagMAX™ Viral/Pathogen kit on KingFisher™ Flex Purification System (Thermo), cDNA generated using Superscript III (Thermo) and Uni-12 primer. A pair of ~200 bp amplicons across position 349 of the PA gene and position 631 of the PB2 gene were generated by PCR for each sample and were designed to include one of four 4 bp terminal barcodes (CACA, GTTG, AGGA or TCTC) using the primers in Supplementary Table 5. The pair of PA and PB2 amplicons for each sample were combined. Pools of samples were made using samples representing each of the four unique barcodes and a second barcode was added to the pooled amplicons using NEBNext® Ultra™ II DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB). Pooled samples were pooled together and sequenced with Illumina MiSeq v2 150 PE micro kit (Illumina). Sequencing reads were demultiplexed and variant proportions at each locus quantified.Statistical analysis and graphical illustrationStatistical analysis of biological replicates was performed by unpaired two-tailed T-test, One-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple comparison test, or Mann–Whitney test using GraphPad Prism 9. Sample sizes were not predetermined using any statistical methods. Some illustrations in Figs. 1 and 5 were generated using BioRender.com.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.

While most influenza viruses cannot replicate in edited human cells lacking both ANP32A and ANP32B, some strains exhibit limited growth. Here, we experimentally evolve such an influenza A virus in these edited cells and unexpectedly, after 2 passages, we observe robust viral growth. We find two mutations in different subunits of the influenza polymerase that enable the mutant virus to use a novel host factor, ANP32E, an alternative family member, which is unable to support the wild type polymerase. Both mutations reside in the symmetric dimer interface between two polymerase complexes and reduce polymerase dimerization. These mutations have previously been identified as adapting influenza viruses to mice. Indeed, the evolved virus gains the ability to use suboptimal mouse ANP32 proteins and becomes more virulent in mice. We identify further mutations in the symmetric dimer interface which we predict allow influenza to adapt to use suboptimal ANP32 proteins through a similar mechanism. Overall, our results suggest a balance between asymmetric and symmetric dimers of influenza virus polymerase that is influenced by the interaction between polymerase and ANP32 host proteins.

Influenza A viruses have also transmitted to several other mammalian hosts including pigs, dogs, horses, bats, seals and whales1. Like all viruses, influenza A viruses need to co-opt host factors to successfully replicate within a host cell2. Influenza A virus requires host factors at many different stages of its life cycle from entry, transport of gene segments to the nucleus, replication, packaging to exit3,4,5. As a result, the virus must adapt to novel host factors to successfully emerge in a new host species1. Pandemic preparedness requires us to identify mutations which allow or prevent animal viruses from using human host factors and to understand the mechanisms that enable host switching6.The influenza A virus polymerase is a heterotrimer composed of three subunits PB2, PB1 and PA. The enzyme is highly dependent on the cellular environment and co-opts a large repertoire of host factors to support its activity for transcription and replication of the negative sense RNA genome2,7. ANP32 proteins are key host factors that are essential for influenza virus replication8,9. They are also important for determining the host range of influenza virus10. Birds and mammals each express three members of the ANP32 family; ANP32A, avian/mammalian ANP32B (paralogues) and ANP32E11. All have two domains: a leucine rich repeat (LRR) with a solenoid structure linked to a C-terminal low complexity acidic region (LCAR). The human ANP32 proteins are involved in a multitude of cellular processes including protein trafficking, phosphatase regulation, and apoptosis12. They also all have roles associated with chromatin remodelling; huANP32A and huANP32B bind to H3-H4 histones, whereas huANP32E preferentially binds to H2A.Z histones13,14. ANP32 proteins are needed by influenza virus polymerase to support replication15,16,17. Mammalian-adapted influenza viruses can use either mammalian ANP32A or ANP32B, with different viruses showing a preference in different species18,19. The finding that human cells engineered to lack expression of ANP32A and B do not support influenza A virus polymerase activity nor viral replication suggests that influenza A viruses do not utilize human ANP32E8,9. Avian ANP32A contains a 33 amino acid insertion compared to mammalian ANP32 proteins10 although alternative splicing can result in the formation of shorter avian ANP32As with either a 29 amino acid insertion or no insertion20,21. Avian influenza viruses rely solely on ANP32A in avian cells; avian ANP32B and ANP32E show no ability to support influenza A polymerase and chicken cells engineered to lack expression of chANP32A do not support viral polymerase activity nor virus replication11,22. When avian influenza A viruses adapt to mammals including humans, adaptive mutations in polymerase such as the PB2 E627K mutation allow the virus to use the shorter form of ANP32A or B that lack the 33 additional amino acids. This is due to enhanced interactions of the 627K polymerase with a stretch of negatively charged amino acids within the LCAR domain of human ANP32 proteins15,23.Structural analyses of influenza A polymerases of human and avian viruses reveal that the polymerase complex can form a symmetric dimer24,25. The majority of the symmetric dimer interface is formed by PA with smaller contributions from amino acids in PB1 and PB2. The formation of the symmetric dimer has been shown to be required for vRNA synthesis from a cRNA template, with one of the polymerases acting as a replicase and the other as a trans-activating polymerase that enables the realignment of the influenza genome during replication24,26. A recent structure of the influenza C polymerase in complex with ANP32A shows that the polymerase can form an alternative asymmetric dimer with the LRR of ANP32 bridging two polymerase enzymes, one bound to the viral promoter RNA and therefore a replicase and the other proposed as an encapsidating polymerase that could load onto the nascent RNA15. Recent data suggest that polymerase dimerization is regulated during infection27,28. However, the exact mechanism through which this is achieved and the role of ANP32 proteins is not clear.Host factors have been proposed as targets for new antiviral drugs and could be targets for gene-editing to create farm animals such as poultry or swine resistant or resilient to influenza11,29. However, it is not clear whether viruses can evolve to evade antiviral strategies that target host factors, and this has only been studied in a few instances30,31. ANP32 proteins are potential targets for novel influenza intervention strategies.In this study, we investigate whether influenza A virus can evolve to replicate in human cells lacking expression of ANP32A and ANP32B. We describe one example of a virus that shows limited replication in cells lacking human ANP32A and B, and evolves in those cells to increase replication efficiency compared to the ancestor virus. We demonstrate that the mutated influenza polymerase is able to co-opt an alternate host factor, ANP32E. Unexpectedly, the mutations in PB1 and PA, which allow the use of the previously non-functional ANP32E, map to the interface of the symmetric dimer, even though ANP32 interacts with the asymmetric polymerase dimer. Moreover, the adapting mutations reduce symmetric polymerase dimerization, suggesting a link between ANP32 support and dimerization states of influenza virus polymerase.ResultsExperimental evolution of an influenza A virus in the absence of human ANP32A and ANP32BWe previously showed that influenza virus polymerase activity and virus replication were generally abrogated in human cells that did not express ANP32A and B (DKO cells). However, we and others have also reported low levels of replication for certain influenza A viruses on these cells8,9. A 6:2 reassortant virus (Tky05), showed low infectious titres <102 p.f.u/ml on DKO cells after 48 h (Fig. 1A). This virus has an internal gene set derived from a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, Aurkey/Turkey/05/2005(H5N1), with the mammalian-adapting PB2 mutation E627K10,32 and external proteins, HA and NA, from PR833. To test whether this virus could evolve to replicate efficiently in the absence of huANP32A and ANP32B, we passaged three independent populations of Tky05 on DKO cells for four passages. Three independent control populations were passaged on WT eHAP cells. After two passages, we found that titres of all three evolved populations in DKO cells were comparable to titres attained by the ancestral virus on WT eHAP cells (Supplemental Fig. 1). Infection of DKO cells with a standard MOI (0.01) of each of the three evolved populations resulted in high titres 48 h post infection whereas infection of DKO cells with the 3 populations that had been passaged in WT eHAP cells did not yield infectious virus. Yields of all 6 populations were similar in WT eHAP cells (Fig. 1B). We sequenced the DKO evolved populations and found mutations present at differing frequencies in segments coding for the polymerase subunits PA, PB1 and PB2, and in one population, an additional mutation in NS (Fig. 1C). We twice plaque-purified and chose a plaque from population 2 for further characterization. Sequencing of this clone revealed just the two mutations in the polymerase subunits: K577E in PB1 and Q556R in PA and no changes in PB2, NS or the PR8 HA and NA segments. We compared the growth of the plaque-purified virus to its unpassaged WT ancestor (Fig. 1D, E). In MDCK cells there was a marginal increase in final titre attained by the mutant K577E + Q556R virus (Fig. 1D). In eHAP WT cells we observed slightly accelerated growth of the K577E + Q556R virus at 8 h post infection but this did not result in an overall growth advantage post 16 h. In DKO cells however the mutant virus replicated productively, and attained titres of 106 PFU/ml by 48 h post infection, in contrast with the ancestor, which did not yield virus until 72 h post infection when 104 PFU/ml were detected. This late increase in titre for the WT virus was reminiscent of the observation in Fig. 1A, and may represent within-experiment adaptation.Fig. 1: An influenza A virus evolved to grow in human cells lacking ANP32A and ANP32B proteins.A Tky05 was inoculated on 12-well plates of eHAP (control) and DKO cells at an MOI of 0.0005. Samples were titred on MDCK cells via plaque assay at 24 and 48 h post infection. Data are presented as mean values +/− SD. B Following two passages through either DKO cells or WT eHAP cells (control), 1000 PFU from each population as well as the ancestor (Tky05) were inoculated onto six-well plates of DKO and eHAP cells. After 48 h, viruses were titred on MDCK cells via plaque assay. n = 3 wells, data are presented as mean values +/− SD. C Mutations from populations passaged through DKO cells were discovered using Sanger sequencing. Highlighted mutations were found in the plaque-purified virus, which was used for future experiments. Growth curves of Tky05 compared to plaque-purified virus containing PB1 K577E, PA Q556R on MDCK (D) or eHAP (E) cells. 12-well plates were infected at MOI 0.001 (D) or 0.0005 (E), and viral titres were measured on MDCK cells at 8, 16, 24, 48 and 72 h. n = 3 wells, data are presented as mean values +/− SD. Statistical significance was determined by multiple t-test of log-transformed data, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001, (1D; 8 hpi p = 0.238, 16 hpi p = 0.206, 24 hpi p = 0.035, 48 hpi p = 0.017, 72 hpi p = 0.339. 1E; 8 hpi p = 0.003, 16 hpi p = 0.101, 24 hpi p = 0.802, 48 hpi p = 0.600, 72 hpi p = 0.066) Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imagePB1 K577E and PA Q556R enable polymerase activity in the absence of ANP32A/BTo investigate the effect of PB1 K577E and PA Q556R on influenza polymerase activity in DKO cells, we introduced these mutations into the respective expression plasmids to reconstitute the heterotrimeric polymerase. A minigenome assay was performed in the presence or absence of exogenous huANP32B (Fig. 2A). As shown previously, Tky05 polymerase was not active in DKO cells but activity could be rescued by the introduction of exogenous huANP32B. In contrast, the reconstituted mutant polymerase, K577E + Q556R bearing both PB1 and PA mutations, displayed significant activity in the DKO cells. Furthermore, the expression of huANP32B increased the activity of the K577E + Q556R polymerase to 20 times that of WT. To investigate the contribution of each of the mutations, we assessed them individually in the minigenome assay. Neither the PB1 K577E polymerase nor the PA Q556R polymerase alone displayed significant polymerase activity in DKO cells, although PB1 K577E activity was detectable and above WT. Upon the addition of huANP32B, the PB1 K577E polymerase showed very high activity whereas PA Q556R polymerase showed activity comparable to WT. Thus, both K577E and Q556R were necessary for robust polymerase activity in DKO cells but K577E was solely responsible for the increased activity in the presence of huANP32B. Western blots of polymerase protein expression revealed that the K577E mutation led to enhanced stability of PB1 (Fig. 2A). To test the effect of the PB1 expression levels on polymerase activity we conducted a minigenome assay with a titration of PB1 WT (Supplemental Fig. 2). At levels comparable to PB1 K577E, WT PB1 did not increase polymerase activity, thus higher PB1 K577E protein levels are not responsible for activity in DKO cells.Fig. 2: Tky05 PB1 K577E and PA Q556R mutations enhance influenza polymerase activity in the absence of human ANP32A/B.Minigenome assays were performed in 24-well plates of eHAP DKO cells transfected with pCAGGS Tky05 PB2 (0.04 µg), PB1 or K577E (0.04 µg), PA or Q556R (0.02 µg), NP (0.08 µg), reporter pPolI-luc (0.08 µg) and control pCAGGS-Renilla luciferase (0.04 µg) and (A) +/− huANP32B-FLAG (0.04 µg).

We hypothesized that, in the latter scenario, the most likely novel host factor would be huANP32E, as it is the most closely related protein to huANP32A and huANP32B (58% similarity)1. To test whether ANP32E could act as a replacement for huANP32A/B, we compared the effect of titrating huANP32B, huANP32E or chANP32B in a mini-genome assay performed in DKO cells (Fig. 2B). We have previously shown that chANP32B is unable to support WT avian influenza A virus polymerase function and others have shown that huANP32E is also inactive for influenza A11,22. As before, exogenously expressed huANP32B stimulated activity of the K577E + Q556R polymerase to 20 times more than of the WT. In both cases, the lowest concentration of huANP32B was already at saturating levels with no further increase in polymerase activity observed with increasing protein expression. In contrast, chANP32B provided no support for the WT polymerase and exhibited a slight but significant inhibitory effect on the K577E + Q556R polymerase as protein concentrations increased. Remarkably, huANP32E demonstrated significant levels of enhancement of K577E + Q556R polymerase activity in a dose-dependent manner. Conversely, huANP32E did not rescue activity of WT polymerase in DKO cells despite equivalent levels of protein expression as for huANP32B.We next tested which of the individual mutations were more affected by the addition of huANP23E. Addition of excess huANP32E to DKO cells conferred appreciable activity to the K577E polymerase and slight but non-significant activity with Q556R (Fig. 2C). K577E and Q556R combined synergistically to give increased polymerase activity with huANP32E greater than either individual mutation. As before, WT polymerase activity in DKO cells was not rescued by overexpression of huANP32E, and we postulate this is at least partly explained by sequence variation at residues 125 and 129 in LRR5 (Leucine Rich Repeat 5), a domain of ANP32 we and others have previously shown important for the polymerase-ANP32 interaction (Supplemental Fig. 3)9,11.ANP32E is essential for polymerase activity and viral replication of the PB1 K577E and PA Q556R mutantTo demonstrate that adaptation to use huANP32E was sufficient to explain replication of the mutant virus in DKO cells, we used CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to generate eHAP cells lacking functional huANP32A, huANP32B and huANP32E (TKO cells). We designed gRNAs to create adjacent double strand breaks in DKO cells to disrupt the ANP32E locus (Fig. 3A). We confirmed that the TKO clone lacked an intact open reading frame for ANP32E expression through Sanger sequencing revealing the expected deletion. This resulted in a prematurely terminated ANP32E with the first 54 residues as in the WT protein followed by a frameshift mutation caused by the deletion resulting in 28 nonsense residues followed by 2 stop codons (Fig. 3A). A control clone was also chosen that underwent CRISPR/Cas9 editing but still had full length ANP32E.Fig. 3: PB1 K577E and PA Q556R allow appropriation of human ANP32E.A Schematic showing the location of the CRISPR guide RNAs and PCR primers in huANP32E.

D TKO cells were transfected in a 12-well plate with -ANP32, huANP32B, huANP32E or chANP32B (0.32 µg).

Statistical significance was determined by one-way ANOVA of log transformed data. Samples were compared to -ANP32 of the appropriate virus, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001 3D; Tky WT -ANP32 vs Tky WT +huANP32B p < 0.0001, Tky WT -ANP32 vs Tky WT +huANP32E p = 0.0005, Tky WT -ANP32 vs Tky WT +chANP32B p = 0.2189, Tky PB1-K577E + PA-Q556R -ANP32 vs Tky PB1-K577E + PA-Q556R +huANP32B p < 0.0001, Tky PB1-K577E + PA-Q556R -ANP32 vs Tky PB1-K577E + PA-Q556R +huANP32E p < 0.0001, Tky PB1-K577E + PA-Q556R -ANP32 vs Tky PB1-K577E + PA-Q556R +chANP32B p < 0.0001. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageWe tested whether WT or K577E + Q556R polymerase showed activity in TKO cells. As with DKO cells, there was no activity of WT polymerase in TKO cells and its activity could be rescued by huANP32B but not huANP32E (Fig. 3B). Again higher expression levels of PB1 K577E were detected compared to PB1 WT (Fig. 3B) but the K577E + Q556R polymerase proved inactive in TKO cells. However, activity could be rescued by exogenous expression of either huANP32B or huANP32E. Polymerase complexes reconstituted with the individual K577E or Q556R mutations both showed no activity in TKO cells but could be partially rescued by huANP32E.Next, we tested whether any viral replication was possible in TKO cells. We measured replication of Tky05 and the PB1 K577E + PA Q556R double mutant virus over 72 h in DKO and TKO cells. As before, the double mutant replicated well on DKO control cells, and we detected low but increasing titres in these cells following infection with the WT virus at 48 and 72 h suggesting that further escape mutants were evolving. In contrast, there was no virus detected after infection of TKO cells for either WT or for the double mutant. (Fig. 3C).To test whether exogenous expression of ANP32E could rescue viral replication in TKO cells, we transfected TKO cells with plasmids for huANP32B, huANP32E or chANP32B and infected with a high MOI of virus (Fig. 3D). Neither WT nor mutant virus gave any virus yield at 72 h post infection of the TKO cells in the absence of exogeneous ANP32. Addition of huANP32B supported viral replication to levels around 104 PFU/ml for both viruses. Moreover, addition of exogenous huANP32E rescued viral growth for K577E + Q556R virus and high titres were produced. In the presence of huANP32E, the WT virus also gave rise to low levels of virus at this late time point. The addition of chANP32B also supported replication of the mutant virus but not WT. Thus, our results demonstrate that the combination of mutations at PB1 K577E and PA Q556R resulted in a virus that was able to replicate through evolving to use suboptimal ANP32 proteins such as huANP32E.Q556R is located near PB2 627 in the asymmetric influenza polymerase dimerAvailable structures of the influenza polymerase heterotrimer were used to examine the locations of PB1 577 and PA 556. PB1 residue 577 is located in the thumb domain of the polymerase and close to the mode B site in PB1 responsible for RNA binding34. PA residue 556 is located near one of the binding pockets for the C-terminal domain of cellular RNA PolII35. Recently, human and chicken ANP32 have been shown to interact with an asymmetric dimer of influenza polymerase15. In the asymmetric dimer, the RNA exit channel of the replicating polymerase is aligned directly with the entry channel of the ‘encapsidating’ polymerase15. These two polymerases are bridged by the LRR of ANP32 with the LCAR tail positioned between the two PB2 627-domains. PA residue 556 in the encapsidating polymerase is located near to both PB2 627 residues and to ANP32, making it possible that the switch in PA to 556R could provide additional positive charge (similarly to E627K) to further stabilize the interaction between polymerase and the LCAR tail of the host factor (Fig. 4A). Residue 577 in PB1 is not located close to ANP32 in the asymmetric dimer.Fig. 4: PB1 K577E and PA Q556R increase binding to huANP32E.A Asymmetric dimer of influenza polymerase (PDB: 6XZP) and ANP32 (green) showing PB2 627K in blue, PB1 K577E in red and PA Q556R in yellow. B Co-immunoprecipitation assays were conducted from 10 cm dishes of eHAP TKO cells transfected with pCAGGS Tky05 PB2 (5 µg), Tky05 PB1 or K577E (5 µg), Tky05 PA or Q556R (5 µg) and huANP32B-FLAG/chANP32B-FLAG/huANP32E-FLAG (5 µg). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were lysed, FLAG-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated, and co-precipitation of PB2 was detected using immunoblotting. Data presented are representative of n = 3 biological repeats.

Data presented are representative of n = 3 biological repeats each conducted with n = 3 wells, presented as mean values +/− SD.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imagePB1-K577E is important for binding and utilization of ANP32ETo determine whether the ability of the K577E + Q556R polymerase to co-opt ANP32E is due to an enhanced ability to bind to this alternative host factor, we conducted co-precipitation experiments. DKO cells were transfected with plasmids encoding either the WT or K577E + Q556R polymerase and with either FLAG-tagged huANP32B, chANP32B, huANP32E or GFP-FLAG used as a negative control. After cell lysis, proteins were precipitated using anti-FLAG affinity gel and the amount of PB2 was analysed by immunoblot (Fig. 4B). Under these conditions there was no difference in the amount of PB2 that co-precipitated with any of the ANP32 proteins above the GFP control in the context of WT polymerase. However, the K577E + Q556R polymerase did co-precipitate above background levels (GFP control) with huANP32B and huANP32E, but not chANP32B, which matched the ability of the two huANP32 proteins to rescue the mutant polymerase activity in DKO cells (Fig. 2C).To measure quantitatively the interaction between influenza polymerase and ANP32 proteins, we conducted a split luciferase experiment whereby the N-terminal fragment of Gaussia luciferase (Gluc1) is fused via a linker to C-terminus of the PB1 subunit and the C-terminal fragment (Gluc2) is fused via a linker to the C-terminus of ANP3211 (Fig. 4C). This interaction assay most likely measures the interaction between ANP32 and the encapsidating influenza polymerase since we previously showed that mutations in ANP32 at amino acids 129 and 130, that map to the encapsidating polymerase: host factor interface in the structure, abrogate the luciferase signal11. We compared the signal generated by ANP32 with the WT and either the double or single mutant polymerases (Fig. 4D). For the WT polymerase, we observed a luciferase signal above background only with huANP32B despite similar levels of expression of all ANP32-Gluc2 homologs. The interaction between the double mutant K577E + Q556R polymerase and huANP32B was significantly higher than WT and this was also true for both of the single mutants K577E and Q556R, without changes in protein levels of PA or PB1-Gluc1 proteins. In addition, both double and single mutants interacted with huANP32E, although the signal was lower than for huANP32B interaction, and the binding appeared to be largely driven by the PB1 mutation. Overall, we conclude that the combination of PB1 K577E + PA Q556R allows stronger interaction with huANP32B as well as huANP32E and that the increased binding to huANP32E is mostly driven by K577E. These results are in line with the polymerase activity measured by minigenome assays where PB1 577E polymerase was more readily complemented by huANP32E (Fig. 2C). Given that PB1 residue 577 is located distally from ANP32 in the structure of the asymmetric dimer, K577E must be enabling use of ANP32E by an alternative mechanism.K577E decreases dimerization of the polymeraseNext, we mapped the location of PB1 K577E and PA Q556R on the symmetric polymerase dimer24. Both mutations reside directly in the dimer interface with the side chains of K577 and Q556 14–16 Å apart (Fig. 5A). Given their location, we investigated whether these mutations alone or in combination altered dimerization of the polymerase. We performed a split luciferase complementation assay in which either the N-terminal or C-terminal fragment of Gaussia luciferase was fused to the C-terminus of a PB1 subunit (Fig. 5B). Tagging the PB1 protein at the C-terminus with the Gluc1 or 2 fragments did hinder the activity of the polymerase but the effect was comparable between PB1-WT and PB1-K577E (Supplemental Fig. 4). When the polymerase forms a dimer, the two differently tagged PB1 proteins from each protomer will be brought into close proximity allowing reconstitution of a functional Gaussia luciferase. We reasoned that this PB1-PB1 split luciferase complementation assay measured the symmetric but not the asymmetric dimer since in the symmetric dimer, the C-terminals of PB1 are on the same face of the dimer 110 Å apart allowing for the two luciferase fragments to interact, whereas, in the asymmetric dimer, although the C-terminals of PB1 are not both fully resolved, they are on opposite sides of the dimer (~180 Å apart) making the reconstitution of active luciferase from this pairing unlikely. To experimentally test this reasoning, we introduced alanine mutations in PA 352-6, which have previously been shown to disrupt the symmetric dimer interface24. Indeed, we did not detect any significant interaction between PB1 components of a polymerase complex reconstituted with this PA mutant above background levels (in the absence of PA) (Fig. 5C). In contrast, dimerization of WT polymerase was indicated by a strong luciferase signal. That we detected this interaction in TKO cells indicates that the dimerization measured was not dependent on ANP32 proteins. However, when the polymerase contained the PB1 K577E mutations in both tagged PB1 clones either alone or in combination with PA Q556R, there was no signal above background. The PA mutant alone had a smaller effect on disrupting the dimerization compared to PB1 K577E.Fig. 5: PB1 K577E destabilises formation of the polymerase dimer.A Symmetric dimer of influenza polymerase (PDB: 6QX8) showing PB1 K577E in red and PA Q556R in yellow. B Schematic showing the split-luciferase dimerization assay with C-terminus of Gaussia luciferase and the N-terminus of Gaussia luciferase attached to separate PB1 proteins. The two halves of the luciferase are 110Å in the same plane of the symmetric dimer and 180 Å on opposite sides of the asymmetric dimer.

Data presented are representative of n = 3 biological repeats each conducted with n = 3 wells, presented as mean values +/− SD.

Accompanying Western blot showing expression of PB1/K577E-Gluc, PA/Q556R and tubulin. D Tky05 WT polymerase and PB1 K577E + PA Q556R were cloned into baculovirus and expressed in Sf9 cells. The polymerases were purified and concentrated (as described in the methods) then analysed by size exclusion chromatography. Lower elution volume is indicative of higher molecular weight. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageTo further validate how these mutations impact polymerase oligomerization, we purified recombinant WT and mutant polymerases following their expression in insect cells and analysed their elution profiles by size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 5D). WT polymerase eluted with a higher molecular weight peak corresponding to dimers, whereas K557E + Q5565 polymerase eluted later, indicative of monomeric polymerase. Together these results demonstrate that K577E, and to a lesser extent Q556R, abrogate the formation of the symmetric dimer.ANP32E is required for vRNA synthesis by K577E + Q556R virus in the absence of ANP32A and BNext, we tested how the WT and K577E + Q556R viruses differ in the production of different RNA species in the presence or absence of ANP32 proteins. We measured mRNA, cRNA and vRNA levels in eHAP, DKO and TKO cells for WT and mutant virus at early (2 h.p.i.) and later (5 and 8 h.p.i.) time points (Fig. 6). At 2 h.p.i., mRNA resulting from primary transcription was detected in all cells and for both viruses, in line with previous observation that ANP32 proteins do not impact transcription8,36. vRNA replication for both viruses was evident by 5 h.p.i., and levels increased further by 8 h.p.i. In contrast, in DKO or TKO cells, vRNA levels of WT virus did not increase whereas the mutant virus showed a significant increase in vRNA by 8 h.p.i. in DKO cells, but not in TKO cells. This confirms that ANP32 proteins are required for vRNA synthesis and that the mutant virus can use ANP32E in DKO cells to accomplish this step of replication. Interestingly, we observed some increase in cRNA levels in DKO cells even for WT virus in contrast to our recently reported results36. This may underlie the ability of this particular strain to evolve in the way we have described here.Fig. 6: PB1 K577E + PA Q556R requires ANP32E to support vRNA synthesis.A–C Segment 6 vRNA (A) cRNA (B) or mRNA (C) accumulation over time in eHAP WT, DKO and TKO cells following infection with Tky05-WT or Tky05-K577E + Q556R (MOI = 3).

This suggested that K577E and Q556R could also serve as adaptations for influenza A virus polymerase to use murine ANP32 proteins. Previously, only mouse ANP32B has been shown to be able to support influenza A virus replication8,9,44. We performed a minigenome assay in DKO cells comparing activity of WT to K577E + Q556R polymerase in the presence of exogenously expressed muANP32A, muANP32B or muANP32E (Fig. 7A). All ANP32 proteins were well expressed and exogenous ANP32 expression did not affect levels of polymerase proteins, indicated by immunoblot of PB2. For WT polymerase, murine ANP32 proteins provided little support of activity, with the muANP32B being the only one to result in luciferase reporter signals above background. This is in keeping with murine ANP32 proteins harbouring sequence differences in LRR5 especially amino acids 129 and 130 previously mapped to interact with ANP32 (Supplemental Fig. 3). However, the K577E + Q556R polymerase was active in the DKO cells, and activity was further enhanced by exogenous expression of either muANP32A, muANP32B or muANP32E, with muANP32B being most potent (Fig. 7A). This effect was driven mostly by the K577E mutation in line with the earlier results with human ANP32 proteins (Fig. 2).Fig. 7: PB1 K577E + PA Q556R polymerase can use suboptimal murine ANP32 proteins.A Minigenome assays were performed in 24-well plates of eHAP DKO cells transfected with pCAGGS Tky05 PB2 (0.04 µg), PB1 or K577E (0.04 µg), PA or Q556R (0.02 µg), NP (0.08 µg), reporter pPolI-luc (0.08 µg), control pCAGGS-Renilla luciferase (0.04 µg) and either -ANP32, muANP32A-FLAG, muANP32B-FLAG or muANP32E-FLAG (0.04 µg).

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageTo test whether the K577E/Q556R virus replicated better in mice, we infected mice with WT Tky05 or K577E/Q556R virus. Mice infected with the K577E/Q556R virus showed significantly greater weight loss compared to Tky05 infection with several K577E/Q556R virus-infected mice reaching the humane endpoint before 7 days (Fig. 7B). In agreement with weight loss data, K577E/Q556R virus titre was significantly higher than for Tky05 in the lungs at day 2 post infection (Fig. 7C).To investigate whether other mutations found in avian influenza viruses that have adapted to mice could also be increasing the use of mouse ANP32 proteins through a similar mechanism that affects polymerase dimerization, we mapped murine adaptations described in the literature onto the structure of the symmetric dimer (Fig. 7D). We found many examples of mouse-adapting mutations in the symmetric dimer interface, most notably mutations at PA N29145, L29546, L33647, A34348,49,50,51,52, D34751,53,54, E34943,45,55,56,57 (already shown to be a mutant that reduces polymerase dimerization28), K35358, K35652,59 and other sites referenced in24. In addition, there were several reported mutations close to PA Q556 at positions 549–554, which could affect either polymerase dimerization or mediate a more direct interaction with ANP3243,52,60,61,62,63.DiscussionANP32 proteins are crucial host factors for influenza replication. In human cells, huANP32A or huANP32B are required to support replication of influenza A viruses, whereas huANP32E is usually inactive. After passage on human cells lacking huANP32A and huANP32B, an influenza A virus evolved to use huANP32E. The evolved virus did not replicate in the complete absence of ANP32 proteins, which confirms their essential role in influenza propagation. huANP32E and chANP32B were previously found incapable of supporting influenza A polymerase, although overexpressed huANP32E did exhibit limited support for influenza B polymerase activity64. Both these ANP32 proteins differ from those that do support the viral polymerase at amino acids 129 and/or 130. The I129/N130 pair were mapped as key residues preventing chANP32B from supporting influenza polymerase9,11. huANP32E has E129 instead of the N129 found in the huANP32A and B proteins, which is likely responsible for its inability to support WT influenza polymerase, and murine ANP32 proteins also vary at these residues accounting for their suboptimal use by the WT virus as well (Figs. 2D and 7B).The recombinant virus with internal genes from Tky05 was chosen as the ancestor virus for these experiments due to low levels of replication observed on DKO cells. It is currently unknown whether other viruses would evolve to use ANP32E as readily. Interestingly, although we recently showed that for most strains, ANP32 proteins are required to support stabilization of cRNA produced in the pioneering round of replication from incoming vRNA genomes36, here we observed some increase in cRNA levels in DKO cells even for the ancestral virus. This may underlie the ability of this strain to evolve to use ANP32E. Another recent observation suggested that NEP proteins of influenza A can compensate for suboptimal ANP32 use65, which suggests that variation in NEP could help determine which viruses can adapt to suboptimal ANP32s.We focused here on an evolved viral clone with two polymerase mutations, PB1 K577E and PA Q556R. K577E and Q556R were found together on a clone from a single population but were not present in the consensus sequence of two other Tky05 virus escape populations, which also had increased growth on DKO cells (Fig. 1B, C). This suggests there are likely other evolutionary paths towards utilization of huANP32E and further studies will aim to elucidate these. The K577E/Q556R combination allowed polymerase to interact with and use huANP32E, but not chANP32B, at least in the polymerase assay (Fig. 2C). huANP32E, and all 3 murine ANP32 proteins have a single mutation at 129/130 compared to huANP32A/B whereas chANP32B is different at both sites (Supplemental Fig. 3). The additional change may make it harder for the influenza polymerase to appropriate chANP32B for replication. Other changes elsewhere in chANP32B may also reduce its ability to interact with influenza polymerase and support activity11.PB1 K577E and PA Q556R reside in the symmetric dimer interface that is formed between two polymerase heterotrimers. This dimer is implicated in the replication step of cRNA to vRNA synthesis, a step for which ANP32 has been shown to be required. Indeed, our results here confirm the essential role of ANP32 proteins for vRNA production (Fig. 6A). A previous study identified PB1 K577G as a mutation which reduced influenza A polymerase dimerization and restored fitness to a reassortant virus that had a polymerase with a mixed origin of subunits28. A more recent study found that the adjacent residue K578 is subject to ubiquitinylation and that mutation to A or R at that site impacts dimerization, polymerase activity and replication27. Here we found that K577E on its own reduced dimerization of the Tky05 polymerase. However, K577E alone did not allow polymerase activity in the DKO cells implying that reduced dimerization of the symmetric dimer by itself does not efficiently support the use of ANP32E without further changes. Although Q556R is present in the symmetric dimer interface, it did not impair dimerization to the same extent as PB1 K577E. However, like PB1 K577E, PA Q556R did enhance the polymerase’s interaction with both ANP32 B and E. Considering the proximity of PA Q556R to the C-terminus of ANP32, it seems possible that this charge reversal mutation makes direct interaction with the acidic residues of the ANP32 LCAR. We propose that a reduction in dimerization is a key component of the ability of the influenza virus to use an alternative ANP32, but the polymerase may require additional mutations to use ANP32E with robust activity.In the only structure of polymerase in complex with ANP32, the host protein binds across the replicating and encapsidating polymerase heterotrimers that form an asymmetric dimer. ANP32 residues 129 and 130 form contacts with the polymerase in this structure, but PB1 577 and PA 556 are not located close to these contacts. PA 556 is proximal to PB2 627 and, as mentioned above, could interact with the LCAR of ANP32. However, this still raises the question of why we measure increased interaction between the PB1 K577E/PA Q556R mutated polymerase and ANP32. Our observations could be explained by the escape mutations altering a balance between the two alternate forms of polymerase dimers (Fig. 8). By reducing the ability of the polymerase to form the symmetric dimer, the virus favours the formation of the asymmetric dimer even with a suboptimal ANP32. Thus the balance between monomeric (transcriptionally competent), asymmetric and symmetric dimers is dictated by the relative stoichiometry of FluPol and ANP32 proteins. One caveat to this study is that our interaction assays rely on overexpressed levels of protein that may not reflect the levels of endogenous ANP32 or changing abundance of FluPol throughout infection. More research will be needed to fully understand the balance of polymerase dimers and how this impacts on polymerase mode of action.Fig. 8: PB1 K577E and PA Q556R rebalance influenza polymerase dimer formation.Schematic showing the proposed mechanism of how PB1 K577E and PA Q556R appropriate ANP32E to re-balance the equilibrium of polymerase dimers.Full size imageE627K in PB2 is a common mammalian adaptation in avian influenza viruses that arises to complement the mammalian version of ANP3210. Further research has linked other mutations in PB2 to ANP32 adaptation19 and has also suggested that certain mutations in PA could facilitate the acquisition of the E627K mutation66. Our results now show that mutations in PB1 and PA can also be involved in adaptation to enhance utilization of otherwise suboptimal ANP32 proteins. Both K577E and Q556R have been found to adapt influenza viruses to mice37,38,39,40,41,42,43. We found that mouse ANP32 proteins were surprisingly poor at supporting influenza polymerase in a minigenome assay likely due to the amino acid sequences of murine ANP32A, ANP32B and ANP32E at position 129/130. Both WT and mutant polymerases were most efficiently complemented by murine ANP32B which agrees with results showing that ANP32B is required for viral pathogenicity in mice44. K577E increased polymerase activity in conjunction with all murine ANP32 proteins, and the K577E/Q556R virus showed increased replication and pathogenicity in mice. Q556R alone also showed an increase in polymerase activity with muANP32B. Supporting our hypothesis that reduced polymerase dimerization promotes use of suboptimal ANP32 proteins, many previously described mouse-adapting mutations map to the symmetric dimer interface (Fig. 7E)24. One of these mutations, E349K, has already been shown to reduce formation of the symmetric dimer28 and we predict other mutations will show a similar effect.Host factors that are co-opted by viruses to support their replication are promising targets for new drugs and for gene editing to create virus resilient farmed animals such as poultry or swine. Our results demonstrate the importance of performing experimental evolution to test the robustness of such blocks as the virus may be capable of adaptation to use an alternative host factor. A previous study examining whether influenza could evolve to replicate in mice lacking importin-α7 also described rapid viral adaptation and found that viruses had also become more virulent in WT mice30. It is not surprising that a virus as successful as influenza at infecting different hosts has the flexibility to adapt to use alternative host factors. It will be important to discover all the alternative pathways the virus can use, and whether adaptation comes with a fitness cost, in order to establish whether host targeting strategies are a viable path to virus control. The K577E/Q556R mutations we studied here had no obvious fitness cost in eHAP or in MDCK cells. The ability of the polymerase to use a suboptimal ANP32 could lead to a trade-off in other aspects of polymerase activity, for example the K577E/Q556R virus showed lower levels of transcription leading to reduced mRNA levels and also lower cRNA compared to WT (Fig. 6). The increased replication of the mutant virus in mice reflects the adaptation for use of murine ANP32 proteins which are otherwise sub-optimally co-opted by the WT Tky05 virus, and does not necessarily equate to an increase in fitness in more relevant hosts. The exact role ANP32 plays in influenza replication is still unclear and the full set of polymerase complexes that form during transcription and replication has yet to be fully described. Experimental evolution, such as described here, is an approach that can contribute to this understanding.MethodsEthics statementAll work was approved by the local genetic manipulation (GM) safety committee of Imperial College London, St Mary’s Campus (centre number GM77), and the Health and Safety Executive of the United Kingdom and carried out in accordance with the approved guidelines. All animal research described in this study was approved and carried out under a United Kingdom Home Office License, P48DAD9B4 in accordance with the approved guidelines.Statistics and reproducibilityNo statistical method was used to predetermine sample size for in vitro experiments. For animal experiments a resource equation was used to predetermine group size for weight loss measurement. A power calculation, using previous data from mouse infection experiments, was used in G Power to determine group size required to measure differences in virus lung titres with a power of 0.95 or greater. The experiments were not randomized. The Investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment. One mouse was excluded from the Tky05 WT infected group for weight loss determination because it did not become infected after inoculation.Cells and VirusMadin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK; ATCC) and HEK293T (293T) were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM; Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; labtech.com), 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen) and 1% non-essential amino acids (NEAA; Gibco). Human eHAP cells (eHAP; Horizon Discovery) were grown in Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s medium (IMDM; Thermo Fisher) supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin and 1% NEAA. All cells were grown at 37 °C and 5% CO2.The virus used in this study (Tky05) was a 6:2 reassortant virus with all internal segments from Aurkey/Turkey/1/2005(H5N1) and HA and NA segments from A/Puerto Rico/8/1934(H1N1), rescued from cDNA using reverse genetics techniques as described in Li et al.33. This virus was chosen because of preliminary data that indicated a low level of replication in human cells lacking ANP32A and B, and also to mitigate safety concerns because the PR8 derived HA and NA gene segments restrict infection of humans67 and cross react with antibodies from the pH1N1 component of the seasonal influenza vaccine. Virus stocks were grown on MDCK cells at 37 °C and 5% CO2.Viral growth curvesSix- or 12-well plates of confluent cells were infected by viruses at an MOI (multiplicity of infection) between 0.0005 and 0.01 as stated. Cells were maintained in serum-free medium with the addition of 1 µg/ml TPCK trypsin (Worthington-Biochemical). Supernatant samples were taken every 8 h for the first 24 h post infection, and then every 24 h, and frozen until being titred by plaque assay on MDCK cells.Experimental evolutionThree wells in a six-well plate of eHAP cells knocked out for ANP32A and ANP32B8 were infected with 10,000 p.f.u. (plaque forming units) of Tky05 virus. These were the three treatment populations. In addition, three wells of eHAP cells were infected in the same manner as control populations. After three days, the supernatant was centrifuged to remove potential cell debris, frozen and titred. If possible, 10,000 p.f.u. were then used to infect cells for each passage. If the titre was not high enough, then 200 µl of supernatant was used to infect for the next passage. This experiment was performed for four passages.Plaque purificationVirus was grown on a six-well plate of MDCKs overlaid with a semi-solid agarose overlay medium68. Plaques were picked with a pipette tip before being frozen in 300 µl PBS with 0.35% Bovine Serum Albumin and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. Virus was then grown on six-well plates of MDCKs for initial characterization and further amplified on MDCKs to generate a stock if needed.SequencingViral RNA was extracted using QIAmp mini Viral kit (Qiagen). Reverse transcription was performed using SuperScript IV (Invitrogen) and PCR was performed using KOD polymerase (Merck) with gene specific primers for Sanger sequencing (Eurofins).Minigenome assayeHAP DKO or TKO cells were seeded into 24-well plates and transfected with pCAGGS expression plasmids encoding Tky05 PB1 (0.04 µg), PB2 (0.04 µg), PA (0.02 µg), NP (0.08 µg) and ANP32-FLAG (0.04 µg unless otherwise stated) together with the viral reporter plasmid pPolI-luciferase (0.08 µg) and the internal control plasmid pCAGGS-Renilla luciferase (0.04 µg). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were lysed in 50 µl passive lysis buffer (Promega) for 30 min at room temperature with gentle shaking. Bioluminescence generated by firefly and Renilla luciferases was measured using the dual-luciferase system (Promega) on a FLUOstar Omega plate reader (BMG Labtech).Immunoblot analysisCell pellets were incubated on ice for 1 h in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% Na-deoxycholate, 1% Igepal, 0.1% SDS) supplemented with an EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail tablet (Roche) and 1 mM PMSF. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 mins and the supernatant was mixed with Laemmli 4× buffer (Bio-Rad). Protein samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE using Mini Protean TGX precast gels 4–20% (Bio-Rad) and subsequently transferred to nitrocellulose (Amersham Protran Premium 0.2 µm NC; GE Healthcare) or low fluorescence PVDF (Immobilon-FL 0.45 µm; Fisher Scientific) membranes. Membranes were then blocked in 5% milk-TBS for 1 h at room temperature, followed by an overnight incubation at 4 °C with the appropriate primary antibodies: rabbit α-vinculin (Abcam ab129002, 1:2000), mouse α-tubulin (Abcam ab7291, 1:2500), rabbit α-IAV PB2 (GeneTex GTX125926, 1:2000), rabbit α-IAV PB1 (GeneTex GTX125923, 1:500), rabbit α-IAV PA (GeneTex GTX118991 1:500) mouse α-FLAG (Sigma-Aldrich F1804, 1:500), rabbit α-Gaussia luciferase (Invitrogen; PA1-18, 1:1000). Membranes were washed in TBS-1 % tween and incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Secondary antibodies included sheep anti-rabbit IgG, HRP (Sigma-Aldrich AP510P, 1:20,000) and goat anti-mouse IgG, HRP (Bio-Rad STAR117P 1:1000) or goat anti-rabbit IgG IRdye800CW (Abcam ab216773, 1:20,000) and goat anti-mouse IgG IRdye680RD (Abcam ab216776, 1:20,000). Following washing, protein bands were visualised by chemiluminescence using SuperSignalTM West Femto substrate (Thermofisher Scientific) and/or Odyssey Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences).Generation of triple knockouts/ CRISPRProtospacer sequences in exon 2 (TAATGTGGAACTAAGTTCGC) and intron 2 (GTACAACTAGAATCCAAGCT) of the ANP32E gene were selected using CCTop69, and corresponding Alt-R CRISPR-Cas9 RNAs (crRNAs) were obtained from IDT (AltR1UrArA rUrGrU rGrGrA rArCrU rArArG rUrUrC rGrCrG rUrUrU rUrArG rArGrC rUrArU rGrCrU /AltR2 and AltR1GrUrA rCrArA rCrUrA rGrArA rUrCrC rArArG rCrUrG rUrUrU rUrArG rArGrC rUrArU rGrCrU /AltR2). Cas9-generated DSBs at these sites led to a 615-bp deletion including the splice donor site of exon 2. RNPs containing wild-type Alt-R S.p. Cas9 nuclease V3 (IDT), Alt-R CRISPR-Cas9 tracrRNA (IDT) and crRNAs were reverse transfected into eHAP cells already lacking ANP32A and ANP32B (double knockout)8, using Lipofectamine CRISPRMAX transfection reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The transfected cells were incubated for 48 h prior to single cell sorting on a FACS Aria III Cell Sorter (BD Biosciences). 7–10 days later, genomic DNA was extracted from single cell-derived clonal populations using a PureLink Genomic DNA Mini Kit (Invitrogen), and the locus of interest was screened by PCR using primers GGATCCGTGTAAGGGGATTGG and GGACATTTCTCTGCCAGGACT. Clones with a deletion of the correct size were then verified by Sanger sequencing.Complementation of virus with exogenously expressed ANP32Complementation of virus with exogenously expressed ANP32 was performed by first transfecting TKO cells in a 12-well plate with 320 ng of either huANP32B, huANP32E or chANP32B using Lipofectamine 3000. After 24 h, cells were then infected with either tky05 or K577E/Q556R at an MOI of 1. The inoculum was removed after 1 h and the cells washed twice with PBS adjusted with HCl to lower the pH to 3.0. Further PBS washes were conducted before the addition of DMEM containing 1mg/ml trypsin. Seventy-two hours post infection, viral titre of the supernatant was determined by plaque assay.Co-immunoprecipitationeHAP DKO cells were seeded into 10 cm dishes and transfected with pCAGGS expression plasmids encoding Tky05 PB1 (5 µg), PB2 (5 µg), PA (5 µg) and the indicated ANP32-FLAG (5 µg). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were washed in PBS and incubated on a rotating wheel at 4 °C for 30 min in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, and 1% Igepal, supplemented with an EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail tablet (Roche). Cell lysates were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 20 min and the relative total protein content of each supernatant was measured by a nano-spectrophotometer. Following normalisation, the supernatants were incubated with pre-washed anti-flag M2 affinity gel (Sigma-Aldrich) on a rotating wheel at 4 °C overnight. After three washes with TBS at 4 °C, proteins were eluted by the addition of 100 μl of 150 ng/μl 3× FLAG peptide. Co-immunoprecipitated proteins were detected using immunoblot analysis as described above.Split Luciferase bindingFor measuring ANP32-influenza-polymerase interactions, eHAP DKO cells were seeded into 48-well plates and transfected with pCAGGS expression plasmids encoding Tky05 PB1-Gluc1 (0.04 µg), PA (0.04 µg), PB2 (0.04 µg), and the indicated ANP32-Gluc2 construct (0.04 µg). Control conditions contained pCAGGS-Gluc1 and untagged PB1, or pCAGGS-Gluc2 and untagged ANP32, with all other components remaining constant. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were lysed in 60 µl Renilla lysis buffer (Promega) for 1 h at room temperature with vigorous shaking. Gaussia luciferase activity was assayed using the Renilla luciferase kit (Promega). Injection of substrate and measurement of bioluminescence were carried out using the FLUOstar Omega plate reader (BMG Labtech). Normalized luminescence ratios (NLR) were calculated by dividing the signal from the potential interacting partners by the sum of the two controls70.For measuring polymerase dimerization, eHAP TKO cells were transfected with pCAGGS expression plasmids encoding Tky05 PB1-Gluc1 (0.04 µg) or PB1-Gluc2 (0.04 µg) both codon optimised for gene expression in H. sapien cells, as well as PA (0.08 µg), PB2 (0.08 µg). The assay was then conducted as detailed above.Size exclusion chromatography (SEC)Polymerase subunits PA, PB1 and protein A-tagged PB2 of Aurkey/Turkey/1/2005 were expressed in Sf9 cells from codon-optimized genes (Synbio) cloned into a single baculovirus using the MultiBac system71. Mutations PB1-K577E and PA-Q556R were introduced by mutagenesis PCR. Sf9 cell suspension cultures, maintained in Sf-900 II serum-free medium (Gibco) without antibiotics, were infected with baculoviruses expressing WT or mutant influenza virus polymerase and incubated for 72 h at 27 °C with shaking. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed by sonication (3 × 30 s with 30 s intervals) in buffer A (50 mM Hepes:NaOH (pH 7.5), 500 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.05 (w/v) octylthioglucoside, 1 mM DTT), complemented with protease inhibitors (Roche, cOmplete Mini, EDTA-free) and 100 μg/ml RNase A. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation (35,000 × g, 45 min, 4 °C) and the supernatant was incubated with IgG sepharose beads (Cytiva, IgG Sepharose 6 Fast Flow, 1 ml slurry per L culture) for 3 h at 4 °C. After binding, the beads were washed extensively with buffer A and the polymerase was released overnight at 4 °C with 0.5 mg TEV protease in buffer A. The supernatant containing the polymerase was collected by centrifugation, concentrated to <500 μl and SEC was performed on a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) in buffer B (25 mM Hepes:NaOH (pH 7.5), 500 mM NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mM DTT).RT-qPCRFor RT-qPCR analysis, eHAP cells were cultured in 24-well plates, with each condition in triplicate. Infections were performed at an MOI of 3. To synchronize infection, viral inoculation was performed at 4 °C. At the appropriate time point, cells were lysed using buffer RLT (Qiagen), frozen at −80 °C, then total RNA extracted using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). Quantification of segment 6 vRNA, cRNA and mRNA was based on a tagged primer approach72. For each sample, four reverse transcription reactions were set up using 200 ng RNAeaction, RevertAid H Minus Reverse Transcriptase, plus a tagged primer targeting either vRNA or cRNA, a tagged polydT (for viral mRNA) or an untagged polydT (for GAPDH internal control). Primers used were GGCCGTCATGGTGGCGAATGAAACCATAAAAAGTTGGAGGAAG, GCTAGCTTCAGCTAGGCATCAGTAGAAACAAGGAGTTT and CCAGATCGTTCGAGTCGTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT for NA vRNA, cRNA and mRNA respectively, (tags underlined). Tagged cDNA was then diluted 1 in 10 and quantified using real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) using Fast SYBR green master mix (Thermo Scientific). Primer pairs used were: CCTTCCCCTTTTCGATCTTG/ GGCCGTCATGGTGGCGAAT (NA vRNA), CTTTTTGTGGCGTGAATAGTG/ GCTAGCTTCAGCTAGGCATC (NA cRNA), CTTTTTGTGGCGTGAATAGTG/ CCAGATCGTTCGAGTCGT (NA mRNA) and AATCCCATCACCATCTTCCA/ TGGACTCCACGACGTACTCA (GAPDH). qPCR analysis was carried out in duplicate on a Viia 7 real-time PCR system (Thermo Fisher). Fold changes in gene expression relative to input (0 h.p.i.) were calculated using the 2−∆∆CT method with GAPDH expression as internal control.Animal studiesSix- to eight-week-old female BALB/c (Envigo RMS UK Ltd) mice were maintained in pathogen-free conditions until used for viral infection. Mice were anesthetized using isoflurane and infected intranasally with 105 PFU influenza virus in a 35 µl volume or sterile PBS (mock). Animals were monitored and weighed daily. Lungs were harvested on Day 2 and Day 7, or when weight loss dropped below 80% of the original weight on Day 0. Lungs were weighed, suspended in 1ml of PBS and homogenized using 2.8 mm beads and frozen at −80 °C.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.

(Photo: Sophie McCoy, UNC)TOPICS:H5N1Harbor sealsPuget SoundRabinowitzAvian influenzaOutbreakWildlifeVirusSEATTLE — They might be fun to look at, but experts want you to keep your distance from harbor seals in the Puget Sound.This warning comes after a worldwide outbreak of H5N1 avian influenza jumped to local harbor seals.“It's really an unprecedented outbreak,” said Dr. Peter Rabinowitz, a professor in the University of Washington schools of medicine and public health. “The number of countries involved, the number of different types of animals involved, both birds and mammals, is something we've absolutely never seen before.”In September, NOAA Fisheries announced the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Veterinary Services Laboratories confirmed three adult harbor seals in the Puget Sound tested positive for the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 strain.The seals were stranded on Marrowstone Island on Aug. 18 and 25. The findings confirmed initial testing by the Washington Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory, which indicated the presence of H5N1 in these seals. It marked the first incidence of of H5N1 in marine mammals on the West Coast.Rabinowitz said it's in line with what he’s seen in other parts of the world, including the East Coast and South America.CLICK HERE FOR MORE INFORMATION FROM NOAA FISHERIESHe said the H5N1 virus family has, at times, been able to infect humans and cause severe disease, which is why he called this a potentially dangerous type of influenza.Is there a risk for humans to contract the virus?We just absolutely have to keep this on our radar as an important global phenomenon, even though at the moment the risk to humans, and certainly the risk to humans in Washington state, is very low,” Rabinowitz said. “Just as we thought about social distancing with COVID-19, I think the future is that as much as we love wildlife, having a certain amount of social distance from the wildlife and not having too much unprotected contact.Rabinowitz said people should be careful of their pets and make sure there is no contact with sick or dead wildlife. He said in general, even when the virus jumps to mammals, it doesn’t continue to spread from mammal to mammal.“It's more the direct jump from a bird to a mammal, which we think is what probably happened with these seals in Puget Sound as well,” Rabinowitz said.Rabinowitz said when you see a sick, wild animal, there is always a potential risk to you if you go up and touch it or get too close to being infected. He said you should always use caution, keep away from sick animals, call animal control and find somebody who can deal with it with adequate protective equipment.Stay ConnectedLike UsFollow Ussbg-envelopeNewsletter Sign up /sign-up© 2024 Sinclair, Inc.TermsEEOFCCFCCFCCFCCPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesLoading ...Antibody-based therapy trial shows promise in patients with influenza B | Doherty Website Search Please do not fill-in this field About Our Work Services & Facilities People Education Careers News & Events Support COVID-19 Research Searchss A joint venture between The University of Melbourne and The Royal Melbourne Hospital Search About Overview Laureate Professor Peter Doherty Governance Reports & Publications Brochures Venue Hire Support our work Advocacy Contact Us Our Work Institute Themes Immunology Viral Infectious Diseases HIV Hepatitis Influenza Emerging Infections COVID-19 Antimicrobial Resistance Bacterial and Parasitic Infections Malaria Tuberculosis Buruli Ulcer Cross-Cutting Disciplines Discovery Research Public Health Clinical and health systems research Global Health Education & Professional Development Indigenous Health Computational Science and Genomics Services & Facilities Services Facilities People Education Study at the Doherty Institute Research Projects PhD Clinician Graduate Research Training Meet our graduate researchers Prospective Student Information Session Contacts Careers News & Events News Events Setting it Straight Podcast: Infection and Immunity - Evidence Explained Publications Support COVID-19 Research News 09 Oct 2023 Antibody-based therapy trial shows promise in patients with influenza B Antibody-based therapies for respiratory viruses are a safe and effective tool to treat severe respiratory infections. However, researchers across the globe have faced challenges in the development of antibody-based treatments for influenza, with clinical trials generally showing limited or no impact on influenza A. Today, there are currently no approved antibody-based therapies to treat human influenza. A collaboration of researchers from the Doherty Institute, the Kirby Institute and institutions around the world studied the effect of injected Intravenous Immunoglobulin for Influenza (Flu-IVIG), antibodies from the blood of individuals who have been exposed to or vaccinated against the influenza virus, in people hospitalised with severe influenza, and revealed valuable insights on the complex mechanisms underlying antibody-based therapies for these patients. The team led by Dr Hillary Vanderven, former PhD researcher at the Doherty Institute and now Immunologist at James Cook University, examined the findings of a recent international clinical trial. The trial found that treatment with Flu-IVIG (anti-influenza hyperimmune intravenous immunoglobulin, a concentrated solution of antibodies) improved outcomes in patients hospitalised with influenza B, but didn't provide clinical benefits to patients with influenza A. Dr Vanderven explained that, in a new study published in JCI Insight, the team leveraged the findings from that clinical trial and set out to understand why Flu-IVIG treatment was only effective against influenza B. “Our findings suggest that certain types of influenza antibodies that are capable of killing infected cells, may assist in recovery from severe influenza B but not influenza A,” she said. “Improved outcomes in patients with influenza B were associated with a specific group of antibodies when they were present in greater quantities. Additionally, Flu-IVIG proved beneficial for individuals with low levels of anti-influenza B antibodies. “However, we were surprised to discover that higher levels of these same antibodies were associated with poorer outcomes in patients with influenza A, and Flu-IVIG didn't benefit those with low levels of anti-influenza A antibodies.” University of Melbourne Professor Stephen Kent, a Laboratory Head at the Doherty Institute and the senior author of the paper, said the lack of clinical benefits from antibody treatment on patients with influenza A could be due to a number of factors. “Understanding the intricate balance between the protective and the potentially harmful roles of the antibodies in the immune system is very complex, but crucial,” said Professor Kent. “Things like the type of influenza virus, clinical presentation and the patient’s immunological history may impact on the antibodies’ functions and their ability to kill influenza-infected cells. This is something that needs to be further investigated. “This work provides clues on how to tailor treatments and vaccines for different types of influenza and is a significant step towards understanding immunity to influenza.” Peer review: JCI Insight (DOI: https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.167464) Funding: National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) News Archive 2024 January February March April May June July August September October November 2023 January February March April May June July August September October November December 2022 January February March April May June July August September October November December 2021 January February March April May June July August September October November December 2020 January February March April May June July August September October November December 2019 January February March April May June July August September October November December 2018 January February March April May June July August September October November December 2017 January February March April May June July August September October November December 2016 January February March April May June July August September October November December 2015 June July August October November December KEEP INFORMED Facebook Twitter Instagram Subscribe for the latest news, events and research For any media enquiries, please contact: Communications Team P: +61383441911 E: doherty-media@unimelb.edu.au Contact Us 792 Elizabeth Street Melbourne, 3000 Get Directions doherty-reception@unimelb.edu.au +61 3 9035 3555 Contact Us Facebook Twitter Instagram LinkedIn Keep informed Subscribe for the latest news, events and research First name Last name Email Subscribe We acknowledge the Wurundjeri people of the Kulin Nation as the traditional custodians of the land where our Institute stands.

Wastewater-based surveillance can accurately monitor influenza A and B and RSV at the population level, making it an objective tool to inform public response to common seasonal illnesses, according to research presented at IDWeek 2023. The study found that viral signals in Calgary’s wastewater correlated with weekly confirmed clinical cases for all three viruses. Influenza A peaked in Calgary’s wastewater between November-December 2022; influenza B between February-April 2023; and RSV between November 2022-February 2023. The data come from weekly collections of 24-hour composite wastewater samples from three treatment plants in Calgary between March 2022 and April 2023. The wastewater values were compared to clinical data reported by Alberta Health Services and reported as total cases and test positivity rates across Calgary and Alberta. “Just one flush can hold a lot of information. Wastewater surveillance equips public health experts, clinicians, policymakers and the public with community-based, objective data to inform health and safety decisions against the flu and RSV,” said Kristine Du, BSc, lab technician at the Cumming School of Medicine at University of Calgary and presenting author. “Knowing what viruses are coming down the pike can help prepare individuals and communities appropriately.” Researchers say the results provide a novel surveillance approach that can exist independent to and complementary of clinical testing, enabling detection of common seasonal respiratory viruses, an important step that builds off wastewater surveillance that rose in prominence during the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding community-level viral trends can identify hot spots, inform local public health decision making and prepare clinicians and hospitals for potential outbreaks. Moving forward, researchers say that onboarding additional respiratory viruses to wastewater surveillance capabilities will help provide a comprehensive assessment of viral respiratory disease activity.

Partners Purdue University provides funding as a member of The Conversation US. View all partners Email X (Twitter) Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger As cold and flu season ramps up, health care experts are once again on high alert for the possibility of a tripledemic, or a surge brought on by the respiratory viruses that cause COVID-19, the flu and respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV. The good news is that this year, health officials have more tools at their disposal to combat them. Americans ages 6 months and older are eligible to receive the newest COVID-19 vaccine and the annual flu vaccine. In addition, this year the Food and Drug Administration approved the first vaccine against RSV for use in late pregnancy and adults 60 years of age and older. RSV, COVID-19 and the flu are all contagious respiratory illnesses that have similar symptoms, making it difficult to distinguish between the three viral infections without a lab test. Testing is the only way to know which virus is causing your symptoms. In fact, researchers are working to create one test that can detect COVID-19, RSV and the flu. As a nursing professor with experience in public health promotion, I am often asked about the differences between these respiratory viruses. This year, I am fielding many questions about the timing of getting the new COVID-19 and RSV vaccines along with the flu shot, and whether they can be given together. What to know about the symptoms Symptoms of COVID-19, RSV and the flu can range from mild – or even no noticeable symptoms at all – to severe. Flu symptoms typically come on suddenly, while RSV and COVID-19 often start out mild but can become severe over time. In addition, while a flu infection does not typically affect one’s ability to taste or smell, the loss of taste or smell can be a common COVID-19 symptom. All three infections can cause fevers and fatigue, while chills and body aches are more common with COVID-19 and the flu. More severe symptoms of these infections include difficulty breathing and subsequent infections like pneumonia. Health care experts are emphasizing the importance of getting a lab test to accurately identify the source of your infection. Timing the shots With the new RSV vaccine and updated COVID-19 vaccine now available and flu season just around the corner, a natural question is whether there is an optimal schedule for the three shots. The answer to that question is, if you are eligible, to get these vaccines as soon as possible. It is important to consider that it takes approximately two weeks after vaccination for your body to develop antibodies from both the COVID-19 vaccines and the flu vaccine. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that anyone who is either unvaccinated or has previously received a COVID-19 vaccine before Sept. 12, 2023, to get the updated vaccine. This means now is the time to get the updated COVID-19 vaccine that targets a previously dominant variant of the omicron family. The original COVID-19 vaccines and booster series have dramatically reduced the number of COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations and death rates from the virus. While everyone 6 months of age and older is advised to receive both the COVID-19 and flu vaccines, certain populations have a higher risk for severe infection, such as pregnant women, and should be extra vigilant about getting vaccinated. In addition, among those vaccinated against COVID-19, symptoms during an infection tend to be milder. However, due in part to the quickly evolving nature of the virus, it has become clear that immune protection from COVID-19 vaccination or infection diminishes over time. While studies show that the primary COVID-19 series maintains efficacy against severe disease and death six months after vaccination, protection after vaccination decreases over time. Viruses, such as those that cause COVID-19 and influenza, also continuously mutate and evolve. The fact that COVID-19 vaccine immunity decreases over time and that viruses evolve are exactly why updated vaccines are so critical. Without a large uptake of updated vaccines in the population, COVID-19 infection rates could surge again. Timing is also important with the flu vaccine. Flu cases typically begin to rise in October and peak between December and February, but can last through May. Ideally, people should get vaccinated before flu begins to spread, making the month of October the ideal flu vaccination time. But if you miss that deadline, it is absolutely better to get vaccinated later in the season than not at all. Flu, COVID-19 and RSV vaccines are available at your health care provider’s office, your local health department and most retail pharmacies, although access to the newly updated COVID-19 vaccine is still limited in some areas of the country. Many pharmacies are offering walk-up seasonal flu and COVID-19 shots. Cecilie_Arcurs/E+ via Getty Images A difficult respiratory virus season ahead While infections and hospitalizations from COVID-19 declined dramatically in 2023, experts are remaining vigilant against the possibility of new, more-infectious variants causing another fall and winter surge. Adults 65 and older continue to be the highest-risk group for severe infection. Flu seasons are inherently difficult to predict. Since the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, flu cases have been lower than prior to the pandemic. However, the 2022-2023 flu season still caused over 300,000 hospitalizations and up to 98,000 flu-releated deaths, making vaccination an important prevention tool. To further compound this, flu vaccine rates have been lower during the pandemic, suggesting that Americans may be out of the habit of getting their annual flu shot. Shots can be given together Many are also wondering whether they can or should get the updated COVID-19 booster, the new RSV vaccine and the flu shot at the same time. The good news is, the CDC clearly indicates that it is safe for both adults and children who are eligible for the updated COVID-19 vaccine to get this vaccine simultaneously with the annual flu shot. A 2022 study found that common vaccine side effects, such as pain at the injection site, occurred at slightly higher rates when someone received the flu vaccine and a COVID-19 vaccine at the same time, as opposed to receiving only a COVID-19 booster. However, those reactions, including fatigue and headache, were mild and resolved within a day or two. In addition, a recent study found that the immune response was the same when both vaccines were given together compared to when given separately. Since the RSV vaccine is new, there is no data yet on receiving all three vaccines at the same time. Instead, those at the highest risk of RSV infection should get this vaccine as soon as they are able. Community matters too Getting the COVID-19, RSV and flu vaccines isn’t just about your own health – it’s about family and community health too. Communities with higher vaccination rates have fewer opportunities to spread the virus. Keep in mind that many people cannot be vaccinated, because they have weakened immune systems or are undergoing treatments. They depend on those around them for protection. While one person may experience mild symptoms if they contract RSV, COVID-19 or the flu, they could spread the virus to others who could become severely ill. Because it’s impossible to predict how people will react if they get sick, getting the flu and COVID-19 vaccines – and the RSV vaccine if you are eligible – is the best prevention strategy.

Because so many people fell ill so quickly, physicians at the time believed the healthy were as likely to die from the flu as those who had already been sick or frail. Despite numerous historical accounts, though, it turns out there is no concrete scientific evidence to support that belief. Soldiers gargle with salt and water to prevent influenza. Sept. 24, 1918. Camp Dix, New Jersey, during the 1918-19 'Spanish' Influenza pandemic. Image Credit: Everett Collection / Shutterstock Researchers at McMaster University and the University of Colorado Boulder, who analyzed victims' age of death and studied lesions on victims' bones, report that the most susceptible to dying of the flu had exhibited signs of previous environmental, social, and nutritional stress. "Our circumstances – social, cultural and immunological – are all intertwined and have always shaped the life and death of people, even in the distant past," explains Amanda Wissler, an assistant professor in the Department of Anthropology at McMaster and lead author on the study, published today in the journal PNAS. "We saw this during COVID-19, where our social backgrounds and our cultural backgrounds influenced who was more likely to die, and who was likely to survive," she says. Much of the research on the 1918 pandemic relies on historical documentation such as vital statistics, census data, and life insurance records, none of which include information on pre-existing conditions or general environmental, dietary, or other chronic stressors that can impact one's overall health throughout a lifetime. For the study, researchers examined the skeletal remains of 369 individuals from the Hamman-Todd Documented skeletal collection housed at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History. All had died between 1910 and 1938. The sample was divided into two groups: a control group who had died before the pandemic and those who died during the pandemic. A living person's skeletal structure may undergo lasting changes due to poor health, resulting in diminished height, irregular growth, developmental tooth defects, and other indicators.

For example, new bone formation occurs in response to inflammation caused by physical trauma or infection. Researchers can determine if a lesion had been active, in the midst of healing, or had completely healed, all of which provide evidence of underlying conditions. "By comparing who had lesions, and whether these lesions were active or healing at the time of death, we get a picture of what we call frailty, or who is more likely to die. Our study shows that people with these active lesions are the most frail," says Sharon DeWitte, a biological anthropologist at the University of Colorado Boulder and co-author of the study. Pre-existing medical conditions such as asthma or congestive heart failure are common risk factors that can contribute to poor outcomes from infectious diseases such as influenza. Racism and institutional discrimination can amplify these effects, as evidenced in the COVID-19 pandemic, say researchers. During the Black Death in London, individuals who had previously suffered environmental, nutritional, and disease stressors were likelier to die from the plague than their healthier peers. "The results of our work counter the narrative and the anecdotal accounts of the time," says Wissler. "This paints a very complicated picture of life and death during the 1918 pandemic." The researchers plan to continue to explore the relationship between socioeconomic status and mortality in future work.

The National Institute of Infectious Diseases and other facilities said about 5,000 medical institutions nationwide reported a total of 47,346 flu cases in the week through October 1, up by around 12,000 from the previous week. The average number of flu patients per institution stood at 9.57. Based on the data, health officials estimate that Japan had about 333,000 flu cases. Institutions in Tokyo and 13 other prefectures each saw an average of over 10 cases during the same period, suggesting these places could face a major flu outbreak within the next four weeks. Tokyo pediatric clinic crowded with patients A pediatric clinic in Tokyo's Meguro Ward is seeing a large number of children with cold- or flu-like symptoms. Clinic staff said the numbers of such patients have been twice what they were around this time last year. They said more patients have been testing positive for either influenza or COVID-19. "This year is altogether different. We have to operate after our reception hours to handle all the patients," said clinic head Dr. Nihei Koichi. Dr. Nihei Koichi, head of a pediatric clinic in Tokyo, says it is usually not as busy at this time of year. Influenza vaccinations are in high demand. Nearly all available slots to receive them at the Meguro clinic this month have already been booked. Tokyo faces shortages of medicines Some pharmacies in Tokyo are experiencing shortages of drugs to treat coughs and fevers, as well as expectorant medicines. One pharmacist said they are "pretty much unavailable." Arai Nobuyuki, a pharmacist in Tokyo's Shinagawa Ward, said drug makers have been juggling shipments of cough medication. Inventories of such items remain unstable, and he said, "there just isn't enough." Tokyo pharmacist Arai Nobuyuki says drugs to treat coughs and fevers as well as expectorant medicines are in short supply. "The current strain of cold virus is the most severe ever, and almost no products are available to treat coughs. I would like to request medical institutions to prescribe drugs only to those who really need them," Arai said. Toho University professor Tateda Kazuhiro, an expert on infectious diseases, said he is concerned about widespread drug shortages across Japan if the current situation remains unchanged. "The government needs to take the initiative in establishing a system that can maintain a stable drug supply, as patients cannot afford to forgo taking these medicines," he said. Infectious disease expert Tateda Kazuhiro is worried that drug shortages could become widespread in Japan. Winter could bring unprecedented flu outbreak The Tokyo Metropolitan Government issued an advisory in late September about the possible spread of influenza, the earliest in the season it had ever done so since record-keeping began in 1999. "In Japan, not many people have immunity against influenza as the precautions taken during the COVID-19 pandemic helped keep a lid on flu cases," Tateda said. "The flu is spreading as anti-infection measures such as face masks are gradually being eased." Tateda warns that the rising influenza cases could mean Japan is on the cusp of an unprecedented outbreak in November and December, when flu season typically peaks. Government calls on public to get vaccinated Takemi Keizo, Japan's health minister, is calling on people who are vulnerable to serious illness to be prepared, and get vaccinated as early as possible. Takemi received both a COVID-19 booster and a flu shot at a clinic in Tokyo on Tuesday. "If a new variant of COVID-19 arises, infections of the virus and influenza would spread at the same time," the minister said. Takemi said that the government has secured an adequate supply of the vaccines, and he will closely monitor individual cases to determine whether there are any distribution problems.

This assumption has influenced research and literature for decades. . Sharon DeWitte But new research published Oct. 9 in the journal PNAS suggests it may not be true at all. In examining the skeletal remains of nearly 400 individuals, researchers from CU Boulder and McMaster University found that in 1918—just like in 2020—people exposed to environmental, social or nutritional stressors before-hand were significantly more likely to succumb to a novel virus when it emerged. The findings shine a light on how modern-day communities could better prepare for pandemics and reveal potential shortfalls in relying exclusively on written texts to understand the past. “This idea that the 1918 flu killed healthy young people is not supported by our findings,” said co- author Sharon DeWitte, a professor of anthropology at CU Boulder who specializes in bioarchaeology—constructing the past via the study of human bones. “Instead, we found that this pandemic, like many others across history, disproportionately killed frail people.” Questioning folk wisdom with science In just two years, the flu pandemic of 1918 infected nearly one-third of the world’s population and killed more than 25 million people. Literature is filled with tragic references to it disproportionally striking the young and vibrant. “It seems to get the big, strong ones first,” lamented one character in Thomas Wolfe’s classic flu-era novel “Look Homeward Angel.” “The illness seemed to be as fatal to strong adults as to young children and to the old and debilitated,” reported a U.S. Naval Hospital doctor. Yet despite such anecdotes, the study authors could find no scientific data to support these claims. “It may be one of those ideas that begins as folk wisdom and gets reproduced in the literature over and over until it becomes canon,” DeWitte said. “We wanted to take a step back and ask: Do we really know what we think we know?” She notes that historical documents, while useful, tend to emphasize the fate of the privileged, while leaving out the perspectives of women, children and the disenfranchised. Skeletal remains can be gathered from a larger cross-section of society. And they reflect a lifetime of experiences, from traumatic injuries and diseases to nutritional deficits, which leave traces on teeth and bones. “What skeletal evidence can do is provide us with information about people who aren’t necessarily represented in those historical documents,” said DeWitte. “It can give us a window into their actual lived experiences.” Studying a pandemic during a pandemic DeWitte first got interested in bioarcheology at age 14 when she was diagnosed with scoliosis and underwent surgery. “I would fantasize about future archaeologists digging up my body and being able to spin a tale about my life based on the fact that I had this metal rod that did not decompose,” she recalls. She spent her early career in a cemetery in England, studying remains of those who had died of the bubonic plague, or Black Death, which killed a stunning 30 to 50% of the population in the 14th Century. Her work showed that the elderly and frail were most likely to succumb. For the new study, she and co-author Amanda Wissler, assistant professor of anthropology at McMaster University in Ontario, turned to the Hamann-Todd Human Osteological Collection. It includes more than 3,000 century-old human skeletons housed in the basement at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History. Wissler spent hours in that basement, as the COVID-19 pandemic wore on, poring over the bones of 369 individuals who died before or during a different pandemic a century earlier. The irony was not lost on her. “It’s very important to me to always remember that these were actual people,” said Wissler, who knew their names, ages and dates of death. “It can be intense work.” With magnifying glass in hand she tenderly looked over their shinbones in search of porous lesions—a lasting indicator of trauma, infection, stress or malnutrition. The most frail, based on their bone lesions, were 2.7 times more likely to have died during the flu epidemic, the study found. Wissler notes that because the flu epidemic of 1918 was so widespread it did, indeed, strike people in the prime of their lives sometimes, and those stories resonated, fueling the notion that it was a rare killer of the young. “When a 25-year-old dies you remember it more,” said Wissler. Their study, however, shows that even young victims tended have bones that hinted at prior health problems. “These findings suggest that there was some underlying source of frailty among the victims of the 1918 flu,” they write. The researchers suspect that, like with COVID and the Black Plague, socioeconomic status, education, access to healthcare, and institutional racism may have played a role. But further research is necessary. They caution that the sample size was small and the specimens were all from the Cleveland area so may not fully reflect national realities. But there are lessons to be learned from these bones, the authors said: There is danger in public health messaging that suggests everybody is equally likely to get sick. “What we have learned is that in future pandemics there will almost certainly be variation between individuals in the risk of death,” said DeWitte. “If we know what factors elevate that risk, we can expend resources to reduce them—and that’s better for the population in general.” Categories:Health News Headlines Related Articles A spinout that revolutionized protein discovery for insights into disease treatment SomaLogic is among three spinout companies founded by CU Boulder Professor Larry Gold and has significantly impacted global health care research and diagnostics.

They made two small changes to one of the genes using a technique known as gene editing.The resulting chickens had no side effects after two years. They also had increased resistance to bird flu, but were not fully immune: half the chickens infected with a high dose of the virus developed an infection.Although any increase in resistance to bird flu should be welcome, only a solution that provides complete immunity can be used in practice. Any intervention that develops partial resistance would also encourage the virus to change in order to fight back and so, if the intervention were widely used, it would slightly increase the risk of another human global pandemic if a mutation made the virus deadly to humans.But Prof Mike McGrew, also of the Roslin Institute, told BBC News that experiments in test tubes showed if changes are made to all three genes, then a fully resistant bird might be possible."When we did these edits in the cells there was no growth of the virus at all. The changes stopped all replication of the flu.''I am extremely confident that editing the three genes will give full immunity."Gene-edited pigs immune to lung disease were produced in ScotlandGene editing involves making precise changes to DNA to change the function of a gene. In this instance the three genes were altered to stop them helping bird flu reproduce, but in a way that did not harm the bird.The researchers are trying to identify the further genetic changes required, before producing gene-edited chickens for the next phase of their research.Bird flu is a major global threat, with a devastating impact in both farmed and wild bird populations. In the UK alone, the current outbreak of H5N1 bird flu has decimated seabird populations and cost the poultry industry more than £100 million in losses.What is bird flu and where did it come from?It is thought to have emerged in intensive poultry farming in China in the 1990s.In rare instances, mutations in the bird flu virus allow it to infect people and cause serious illness. DAVID AUBREY/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARYGene editing research is underway to enable hens to produce only female chicks to spare the lives of billions of male chicks which are culled by the egg producing industry each yearPeter Stevenson, of Compassion in World Farming (CIWF) said the use of gene editing to tackle diseases in farms risked making it easier for animals to be kept in poor conditions. "Highly pathogenic bird flu has not been caused by wild birds; it has been generated by the crowded, stressful conditions of industrial poultry production. The proper approach to bird flu necessitates a radical restructuring of the poultry sector to reduce stocking densities and flock sizes as well as to reduce the number of farms clustered together".CIWF has supported the use of gene editing to prevent the slaughter of billions of male chicks at birth who are unwanted by the egg producing industry. The campaign group believes that the technology should be used only to reduce animal suffering.AcceligenUS scientists produced this heat-resistant, high-producing dairy calf with gene editingWork is under way across the world to develop gene edited animals that are resistant to disease and are more productive.Parliament passed legislation earlier this year that permits the commercial development and sale of gene edited food. It opens the door for the use farm animals created by the technology, but a further vote in Parliament will be required, once MPs are satisfied that the animals will not suffer.The study has been published in the journal Nature Communications.Follow Pallab on X, formerly known as TwitterWhat is bird flu and what's behind the outbreak?Gene-edited food now legal to be sold in EnglandGene editingChickensRelatedThe great gene editing debate: can it be safe and ethical?10 Sep 2024BBC InDepthGene-edited food now legal to be sold in England23 Mar 2023Science & EnvironmentWhat is gene-edited food and is it safe to eat?23 Mar 2023Science & EnvironmentMore23 Oct 2024'Frankenchickens grown like morbidly obese child'High Court to hear appeal into ruling about how chicken is produced in the UK.23 Oct 2024Lincolnshire12 Oct 2024Plea for chicken manure plant plans to be reviewedA council previously said permission for the application "cannot legally be granted".12 Oct 2024Hereford & Worcester10 Oct 2024On-the-run chicken causing cross-town cluckusChicken sightings in a petrol forecourt have a town debating where it might have come from.10 Oct 2024Wales3 Oct 2024Chicken farm row reaches High CourtCampaigners are challenging Shropshire Council over plans for a large chicken farm.3 Oct 20242 Oct 2024Family devastated after much-loved farm pets stolenThe family is appealing for help to find their missing pets after their were taken from a small holding.2 Oct 2024Hampshire & Isle of WightBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsUS ElectionSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthVideoLiveAudioWeatherBBC ShopBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoContact technical supportCopyright 2024 BBC.

The board said the site is quarantined and the birds were "depopulated" to prevent the spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza."Unfortunately, HPAI seems to keep popping up during the seasonal migrations in Minnesota," state veterinarian Dr. Brian Hoefs said. "Before today's detection our most recent cases were in the spring of this year. Anyone who has poultry should take this detection as a clear sign to keep a close eye on their flock and initiate your strongest biosecurity practices."Signs of bird flu include decreased eating and drinking, swell of the head area, lower egg production, sudden death and more. You can submit reports of sick birds online or call 833-454-0156.Officials say bird flu doesn't represent a significant threat to human health. Bird flu in MinnesotaThe first detection of the year in Minnesota occurred in April in a backyard mixed flock in Le Sueur County. Bird flu was detected in another small flock in Nobles County in May.Last year, more than 100 Minnesota farms were hit by avian influenza and more than 3.5 million birds were euthanized as a result.READ MORE: Deadly bird flu reappears in South Dakota poultry flocks, as well as Utah's More from CBS News Minnesota DNR emphasizes safety during firearms deer season Hunter shot in head near Moorhead on opening day of Minnesota deer season, sheriff says Authorities, family of Mary Schlais speak on charges in 1974 killing Minnesota boy, 17, drowns in western Wisconsin lake University of St. Thomas volleyball player's vision on life, after a health scare In: Bird Flu © 2023 CBS Broadcasting Inc.

Read time: 2 minutes Researchers from McMaster University and the University of Colorado Boulder analyzed ancient skeletal remains to further understand the death toll of the 1918 influenza pandemic, commonly referred to as the “Spanish flu”.The pandemic killed ~50 million individuals across the globe, claiming more lives than World War I. For many years, scientists have been puzzled by the seemingly high mortality rate among young adults. Because populations fell ill so quickly with the disease, medical professionals at the time assumed that it did not discriminate between the young and healthy, or the sick and frail. “Contemporary accounts further describe the victims as healthy young adults, which is contrary to the understanding of selective mortality, which posits that individuals with the highest frailty within a group are at the greatest risk of death,” the research team behind the study writes in PNAS.Continue reading below...InfographicThe 1918 Flu PandemicRead more Much of the research conducted on the pandemic has utilized historical documents, including census data, life insurance records and vital statistics. Such records fail to document information on any pre-existing medical records, a patient’s environment, diet or lifestyle stressors.Dr. Amanda Wissler, an assistant professor in the Department of Anthropology at McMaster, led the research team in their analysis of 369 skeletal remains obtained from the Hamman-Todd Osteological Collection, housed at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History. The remains were from individuals that had died between 1910 and 1938. Wissler and team divided the remains into two categories for their analyses: those who died during the pandemic and a control group who died before the pandemic.Frail or unhealthy individuals were more likely to die during the pandemic Wissler and colleagues scoured the shinbones of the skeletal remains for lesions, areas of bone that are changed or damaged. Fractures, tumors and inflammation triggered by infection can cause lesions.The research team was able to conclude whether a lesion had been active, healing or had completely healed at the time of the individual’s death, which helps create a clearer picture of whether that individual was suffering from underlying conditions.“The results suggest that frail or unhealthy individuals were more likely to die during the pandemic than those who were not frail. During the flu, the estimated hazards for individuals with periosteal lesions that were active at the time of death were over two times higher compared to the control group,” the research team describes.“By comparing who had lesions, and whether these lesions were active or healing at the time of death, we get a picture of what we call frailty, or who is more likely to die. Our study shows that people with these active lesions are the most frail,” Professor Sharon DeWitte, a biological anthropologist at the University of Colorado Boulder and co-author on the study, says.Want more breaking news?Subscribe to Technology Networks’ daily newsletter, delivering breaking science news straight to your inbox every day.Subscribe for FREE“Our circumstances – social, cultural and immunological – are all intertwined and have always shaped the life and death of people, even in the distant past,” explains Wissler. “We saw this during COVID-19, where our social backgrounds and our cultural backgrounds influenced who was more likely to die, and who was likely to survive.”“The results of our work counter the narrative and the anecdotal accounts of the time,” adds Wissler. “This paints a very complicated picture of life and death during the 1918 pandemic.”Going forward, the team intends to continue their exploration of mortality and socioeconomic status.Reference: Wissler A, DeWitte SN.

Avian influenza is a highly contagious viral infection that affects poultry and wild birds. Currently, two different strains are causing avian influenza outbreaks in South Africa, these are influenza A(H5N1) and influenza A(H7N6). According to the Department of Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development (DALRD), the current influenza A(H5N1) outbreaks have been ongoing since April 2023 and to date, 10 outbreaks in poultry (Western Cape and KwaZulu-Natal) and 39 outbreaks in non-poultry birds (Western Cape, KwaZulu-Natal, Eastern Cape, Gauteng, Mpumalanga and North West provinces) have been reported. The influenza A(H7N6) outbreaks have been ongoing since June 2023, and to date, 50 outbreaks to date have been reported in poultry farms (Free State, Gauteng, Mpumalanga, Limpopo, North West and KwaZulu-Natal provinces) and non-poultry birds in Gauteng. Internationally, sporadic cases of influenza A(H5N1) infection have been reported in humans, related to outbreaks in birds but infection in humans remains very rare. Globally, only 8 cases of influenza A(H5N1) in humans have been reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2023, despite large outbreaks in poultry and wild birds across the globe. These cases have been linked to close contact with infected birds (handling, culling, slaughtering or processing). Current circulating strains of avian influenza have not been shown to transmit from person to person. The risk of transmission of influenza A(H5N1) and influenza A(H7N6) from infected birds to humans is extremely low. In the uncommon instance where avian influenza is transmitted to humans, the most common route of transmission of avian influenza is airborne, through aerosolisation of virus particles from live birds or during the culling process. Poultry products including commercially available eggs, and fresh and frozen chickens are safe to consume. Any persons with known or suspected close contact with dead or sick birds (especially birds with confirmed A(H5N1) or A(H7N6) infection) and who presents with upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms (cough, runny nose, scratchy throat, or pneumonia) and/or conjunctivitis should be investigated. Those who are in contact with live or dead birds, especially those in the poultry industry are advised to wear personal protective equipment including safety goggles, gloves, boot covers, disposable aprons/clothing (fluid resistant), disposable head covers and masks (N95) capable of preventing inhalation of aerosolised virus particles. Hand washing with disinfectant soap after contact with poultry or birds is essential. The public health response remains; prevention of avian influenza at source (bio security at farms, good hygiene and vaccination of poultry in some situations), rapid detection, reporting and response to animal outbreaks and strengthening of surveillance in animals and humans (including collaborations with animal and human health sectors). In addition, laboratory confirmation of the strains involved (PCR and sequencing) and sharing of genetic sequencing data is important.

Use Our Content It can be republished for free. Like blizzards, the specific timing and severity of these outbreaks are hard to forecast. But their damage can be limited in more ways than ever before. More protective vaccines against influenza are on the horizon. And new vaccines against respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, were approved this year, as were updated covid vaccines. Although the first days of rollout for the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines saw hiccups, with short supplies at some pharmacies and billing confusion with some insurers, the shots now are generally available at no cost. What’s more, after enduring the worst pandemic in a century, people are more attuned to protecting themselves and those around them. Wearing face masks and staying home when sick can stop the spread of most respiratory infections. The rate of flu vaccinations has climbed over the past five years. “It seems like the pandemic reminded them of how important vaccination is,” said Brian Poole, a microbiologist at Brigham Young University in Utah. In a study of college students, Poole and other researchers found that flu vaccination rates have nearly tripled since 2007, from 12% to 31% in the respiratory infection season of 2022-23. Only a minority of students expressed “vaccine fatigue.” There is, however, one dangerous departure from the past. Vaccination has become politicized, with college students and older adults who identify as Republican or conservative being less likely to get covid vaccines, as well as vaccinations against flu. Before 2018, studies found that political affiliation had no influence on vaccine uptake. But as measures to limit covid, such as school and church closures, became controversial, some political leaders downplayed the effects of covid — even as the pandemic’s U.S. death toll soared above 1 million. That messaging has led to a disbelief in public health information. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports data showing that covid hospitalizations nearly tripled in the latest surge, with more than 40,000 hospitalizations in the first two weeks of September compared with about 13,600 in the same period of July. But in a recent KFF poll, half of Republicans did not believe in the surge, compared with just 23% of Democrats. Email Sign-Up Subscribe to KFF Health News' free Morning Briefing.

A larger share of vaccine-eligible adults said they planned to get, or have gotten, the flu shot and a new RSV vaccine. “It’s important to recognize that the flu, covid, and respiratory viruses still kill a lot of people, and that the vaccines against those viruses save lives,” said David Dowdy, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. Flu vaccines prevent up to 87,000 hospitalizations and 10,000 deaths each year in the United States. “I like to highlight that,” Dowdy added, “as opposed to making up terms like ‘triple-demic’ to make people cower in fear.” Dowdy predicted this fall and winter will be better than the past few, when patients with covid, influenza, or RSV filled hospitals. Even so, he estimated that more people will die than in the seasons before covid appeared. About 58,000 people died from the flu last season, and hundreds of thousands more were sickened, staying home from school and work. This year, the flu doesn’t appear to be kicking off unusually early, as it did last year with cases picking up in November, rather than in January. And more people are partially immune to covid due to vaccines and prior infections. The effectiveness of flu vaccines varies depending on how well its formula matches the virus circulating. This year’s vaccine appears more protective than last year’s, which reduced the risk of hospitalization from the flu by about 44% among adults. This year, researchers expect an effectiveness of about 52%, based on data collected during South America’s earlier flu season. Its benefit was higher for children, reducing hospitalizations by 70%. The flu’s toll tends to be uneven among demographic groups. Over the past decade, hospitalization rates due to the flu were 1.8 times as high among Black people in the United States as among white individuals. Just 42% of Black adults were vaccinated against the flu during that period, compared with 54% of white or Asian adults. Other issues, ranging from a lack of paid sick leave and medical care to a prevalence of underlying conditions, probably contribute to this disparity. People who have asthma, diabetes, or cardiovascular issues or are immunocompromised are at higher risk of a severe case of flu. Sean O’Leary, an infectious disease pediatrician and the chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics committee on infectious diseases, urges parents to vaccinate their kids against influenza and covid. Children hospitalized with co-infections of the two viruses last year were put on ventilators — an intense form of life support to allow them to breathe — far more often than those hospitalized for the flu alone. And covid is surging now, O’Leary said. Hospitalizations among children under age 18 increased nearly fivefold from June to September. “Almost all of our kids who have died have been completely unvaccinated” against covid, he said. The FDA greenlighted new RSV vaccines from the pharmaceutical companies GSK and Pfizer this year. On Sept. 22, the CDC recommended that pregnant mothers get vaccinated to protect their newborns from RSV, as well as infants under 8 months old. The disease is the leading cause of hospitalization for infants in the United States. The agency also advises people age 60 and older to get the vaccine because RSV kills between 6,000 to 10,000 older adults each year. Rather than vaccination, the CDC advised a new long-acting antibody treatment, nirsevimab, for children between 8 to 19 months old who are at risk of RSV. However, the price could be cost-prohibitive — anticipated at $300 to $500 a dose — and many hospitals lack the staff needed to administer it. Although insurers cover it, the American Academy of Pediatrics warns that reimbursement often lags for a year. “We don’t have the infrastructure in place to ensure all children can access the product,” said its president, Sandy Chung, in a statement. “And that is alarming.” If the wrinkles can be ironed out, said Helen Chu, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Washington in Seattle, better tools could arrive as early as next year. Pfizer, Moderna, and other pharmaceutical companies are developing mRNA vaccines against influenza and RSV that may more precisely target each year’s circulating virus. Today’s flu and RSV vaccines are produced using traditional vaccine platforms, such as within chicken eggs, that are more cumbersome to handle, and therefore the vaccines take longer to develop each year. And President Joe Biden has awarded companies $1 billion to develop covid vaccines that provide longer protection. “The future is going to be all three vaccines together,” Chu said, “but that will be a while yet.” Amy Maxmen: amaxmen@kff.org Related Topics COVID-19 Health Industry Public Health Vaccines Contact Us Submit a Story Tip Share This Story: TwitterFacebookLinkedInEmailPrint Republish This Story We want to hear from you: Contact Us Republish This Story × Copy And Paste To Republish This Story The New Vaccines and You: Americans Better Armed Than Ever Against the Winter Blechs By Amy Maxmen October 13, 2023 Article HTML The New Vaccines and You: Americans Better Armed Than Ever Against the Winter Blechs Amy Maxmen Last year’s “triple-demic” marked the beginning of what may be a new normal: a confluence of respiratory infections — RSV, influenza, and covid-19 — will surge as the weather cools each year. Like blizzards, the specific timing and severity of these outbreaks are hard to forecast. But their damage can be limited in more ways than ever before. More protective vaccines against influenza are on the horizon. And new vaccines against respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, were approved this year, as were updated covid vaccines.

The School of Nursing organized a spot in the Mabee Library for students to recieve their shots. Oct. 12, 2023, the School of Nursing organized the Flu shot Immunization Initiative. Every year as flu season approaches, the School of Nursing recommends getting an annual flu shot to prevent the flu from spreading around campus. Flu shots help prevent the flu during the entire flu season. The flu shot is not just about avoiding a seasonal illness, it is a multifaceted tool that contributes to individual well-being and the advancement of healthcare practices. “Flu Shot is important as the main goal of this is to avoid the infection of the flu altogether. While getting the vaccine, the student might even catch a flu which will help the body to create an antibody to fight,” said Alexi Liamas, junior nursing major. The program started at 11 a.m. and lasted until 1 p.m. With getting an annual flu shot, students are making a proactive, long-lasting investment in their health. The flu is a common respiratory illness brought on by influenza viruses that can sometimes spread to the lungs as well as the nose and throat. Serious side effects from the flu might include pneumonia, bronchitis, asthma and hospitalization. “This process is quick and provides protection for fall and winter. We are organizing this event during flu season to help keep our community vaccinated and healthy,” said Riley Painter, senior nursing major. Many students waited in a queue for their flu shot vaccine. Since the process was short, students didn’t have to wait long. Some were nervous of the injection while others weren’t. Several nursing students were also present. In addition, to protect students from the influenza virus for the upcoming: winter season, the School of Nursing vaccine held this event. Getting this shot helps us gradually develop immunity. It’s a small step that can help prevent illness and reduce the risk of flu-associated hospitalization.

Published Oct. 11, 2023 Chris Casey Staff Reporter post share post print email license skynesher via Getty Images Dive Brief: The price of turkeys may be lower than last year ahead of Thanksgiving, according to a report published last week by the American Farm Bureau Federation. The price of an eight to 16-pound turkey was $1.27 per pound in August, down 22% from the same period in 2022. Producers have worked to repopulate turkey flocks after the outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza in 2022. The number of birds infected with HPAI dramatically decreased over the past year — with only 540 birds infected with the virus in September compared to 8.15 million a year ago — according to the report. Despite this, the virus has has reemerged and could again hamper supply as the weather cools. Two turkey operations have had flocks affected by the virus so far in October — in Sanpete, Utah and Jerauld, South Dakota — affecting a total of roughly 180,800 birds, according to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Dive Insight: After facing sticker shock caused by the supply effects of HPAI breakouts as well as overall inflation last year, consumers of poultry will likely feel some relief this holiday season. Farmers, retailers as well as consumers dealt with significant price increases for eggs and poultry items in 2022. The amount of poultry flocks infected with the virus peaked in March 2022, with 20.98 birds. That number decreased dramatically throughout 2022, and fell significantly throughout 2023, according to the report. The massive culling of flocks helped curb the virus in migratory birds. Roughly 58.98 million commercial and backyard poultry flocks have been killed since early 2022, according to USDA data. HPAI driving up turkey prices in 2022 had a significant impact on the bottom line for meat producers, who have spent 2023 trying to manage their supply of the poultry item. Hormel, which owns Jennie-O turkeys, said it identified infected turkeys in its supply chain in March 2022. This caused an 80% year-over-year drop in turkey volumes for the comp, and the decreased capacity led to a 2.4% annual decline in the meat giant’s overall sales. In its most recent quarterly earnings call, Hormel CEO Jim Snee told investors that while its turkey volumes have improved, profits in the segment are projected to be slightly down year-over-year in the fourth quarter because of lower prices. As producers deal with the continuing threat of the virus, scientists are working toward solutions to prevent infections from occuring. In a study released by MIT Technology Review this week, researchers used gene-editing tool CRISPR to alter the DNA of ten chickens to resist HPAI. Only one chicken was infected with bird flu, and it did not trasmit it to other birds, according to the study.

While receiving the flu and COVID-19 vaccine has become a regular part of flu season for many, the RSV vaccine is now also recommended for people 60 and older, to protect against this cold-like illness that has grown to impact many each year. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the upcoming fall and winter are expected to see similar infection and hospitalization numbers as last year for influenza, RSV and COVID-19. Based on trends, some areas could see higher numbers than last year. With an increase in flu cases already being seen in some communities, more healthy individuals will be needed to roll up a sleeve to donate. The Red Cross continues to suffer from a national blood shortage as donations have not kept up with hospital demand and patient needs this fall. Every two seconds someone in the U.S. needs a blood transfusion, and when supplies are low, it can take weeks to rebuild the national inventory. The Red Cross encourages individuals to protect their own health this cold-season by receiving a vaccination for flu, COVID-19 or RSV. It’s important to know that receiving any of these vaccines causes no wait period to donate and does not affect donation eligibility, as long as you are healthy, feeling well and symptom free at the time of donation. “It’s particularly important that when we see an increase in respiratory illnesses, that those who are in good health share their good health by giving blood,” said Dr. Baia Lasky for the American Red Cross. For those who come to donate now through Oct. 20, the Red Cross will say thank you through a $15 Amazon.com Gift Card by email. Find a blood drive or schedule a donation appointment by using the Red Cross Blood Donor App, visiting RedCrossBlood.org or calling 1-800-RED CROSS (1-800-733-2767). For those that have a respiratory illness, it is important to wait until they no longer exhibit symptoms, have recovered completely, and feel well before attempting to donate.

But years of further testing and regulatory approval are needed before gene-edited birds can be farmed for consumption. Since 2021, a record outbreak of avian flu has devastated poultry farms and wild birds worldwide, caused by the H5N1 subtype of the influenza A virus. The outbreak has also spread to some mammals and occasionally people – including two fatal cases in Cambodia in the past week. As a result, countries including Mexico, France and Ecuador have recently joined China in vaccinating poultry against bird flu. But the US and UK have decided against this strategy, partly due to concerns that current vaccines don’t provide full protection against the circulating strains and would lead to resistant forms of the virus evolving.Advertisement Alewo Idoko-Akoh, then at the University of Edinburgh ,UK, and his colleagues have now tested whether gene editing can be used to protect chickens from the virus. All subtypes of the bird flu virus use a chicken protein called ANP32A to replicate inside chicken cells. By editing genes in chicken cells using CRISPR technology, the researchers found that changing two amino acids in ANP32A prevented the virus from being able to replicate in the cells. They then edited chicken embryos to produce 10 chickens with the altered form of ANP32A, before exposing the birds to a natural dose of the H9N2 subtype of bird flu, which causes milder illness than H5N1. The team also exposed a group of 10 non-edited chickens to the virus and swabbed all the birds’ airways daily for seven days after exposure. All of the non-edited chickens became infected, but only one of the gene-edited chickens did. Idoko-Akoh and his colleagues repeated the experiment with a viral dose 1000 times higher than the natural dose. This time, 5 out of 10 gene-edited birds became infected, but the virus levels in their airways were substantially lower than it was in non-edited chickens. Sign up to our Wild Wild Life newsletter A monthly celebration of the biodiversity of our planet’s animals, plants and other organisms. Sign up to newsletter In these birds, the virus had acquired genetic mutations that enabled it to replicate with the help of two proteins similar to ANP32A, called ANP32B and ANP32E, reducing its reliance on ANP32A. This could explain why some of the gene-edited birds became infected. The researchers then showed that editing the genes for all three proteins together completely prevents virus replication in chicken cells. “We are planning to genetically edit chickens to target all three genes, which we think will be needed to make birds completely resistant to bird flu,” says Idoko-Akoh. “We’re aiming for complete protection to avoid the emergence of viruses resistant to the gene edits.” Despite the promising results, there are many barriers to overcome before bird flu-resistant chickens hit the market. “I’m thinking it’ll be 20 years from now before we might have gene-edited chickens in farms, says Idoko-Akoh. “You have to test for the health and welfare of the chickens, breed the chickens and distribute them.” “Rolling out the technology will be pretty expensive, and that may create an issue in terms of access in places like Africa and Asia where some of the greatest risk for bird flu exists,” he says. Read moreBird flu viruses have mutations that might help them spread to humans Culturally sensitive discussions about the technology will be necessary to find out what people find acceptable in terms of food production, says Idoko-Akoh. “This is a really fantastic study at a time where we’re having a global crisis of avian influenza,” says Kirsty Short at the University of Queensland, Australia. “They really thoroughly investigated gene editing as a way to give birds resistance to influenza.” “We may never achieve 100 per cent protection [against bird flu] using this approach alone, but a combination of genetic modification, widespread vaccination and improved farming practices, such as reducing contact between birds, could be really effective,” says Short.

Still, some develop severe symptoms and complications. In very severe cases, complications can result in death. Getting vaccinated against the flu can help you avoid severe illness during flu season. But what if you come down with mild cold symptoms, like a stuffy nose and sore throat, right before you get a flu shot? You might wonder whether getting the flu shot is safe when you have a cold. Mild cold symptoms don't affect the efficacy of the flu shot. However, if your symptoms are moderate to severe, it's a good idea to consult a healthcare provider. Eugenio Marongiu/Getty Images Should You Get a Flu Shot if You’re Sick? For the most part, getting a flu shot while sick is safe. Generally, mild cold symptoms will not impact the efficacy of a flu shot. However, getting a flu shot while you're sick might depend on the severity of your symptoms, Aditya Gaur, MD, director of clinical research at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, told Health. "Typically, someone with a mild illness can be given a flu shot," explained Dr. Gaur. In contrast, "[if] it's a moderate or severe illness, vaccination is postponed until the person recovers." Delaying your annual flu shot might increase your risk of getting sick. Flu season typically occurs during the fall and winter, with cases rising from December to February. So, try to get your flu shot before then, ideally in the fall, even if you have mild cold symptoms. "A mild illness is not a contraindication to getting the flu shot, and delaying it can potentially result in a missed opportunity for vaccination and related protection against flu," noted Dr. Gaur. When To Postpone Your Flu Shot You should consult with a healthcare provider before receiving either form of the vaccine (nasal spray or injection) if you have moderate to severe illness with or without fever. "[A] healthcare provider may delay giving the flu shot to avoid confusing signs and symptoms of their illness with side effects of the vaccine," added Dr. Gaur. For example, some people have muscle soreness, headaches, and fever after receiving a flu shot. If you already have those symptoms, it might be hard to tell whether you are reacting to the vaccine. Can You Get Sick From a Flu Shot? The flu shot can't give you the flu. It's made up of a "dead," also known as inactivated, form of a flu virus. In contrast, the nasal spray vaccine comprises a live flu virus. However, the virus is weak or attenuated, so it can't get you sick. Flu-like symptoms after getting a flu shot do not mean you are infected. In fact, flu-like symptoms are common side effects after receiving any vaccine. Instead, if you get sick in the first few days after your shot, you might have caught the flu virus before your body had time to form antibodies. On average, your body needs about two weeks to develop vaccine-induced immunity. How To Protect Against the Flu No vaccine guarantees complete protection from illness. However, the flu shot is one of the best ways to protect yourself as much as possible from getting sick or having severe symptoms. Also, when more people get the flu shot, the virus is less likely to spread to high-risk populations like people with weak immune systems, older adults, and infants. Often, those people are more likely to develop severe symptoms if they get sick. In addition to getting the flu shot annually, other ways to protect against the flu include: Stay socially distant from people who are sick or if you are sick. Stay home if you are sick. Cover your mouth and nose with the crook of your elbow if you cough or sneeze. Wash your hands regularly. If you cannot access soap and water, hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol helps kill flu viruses. Do not touch your face (e.g., your eyes, nose, and mouth) without washing your hands. Clean and disinfect any surface or items that people touch. You Can Get the Flu Twice in One Season A Quick Review Annually getting the flu shot is one of the best ways to protect against the flu and reduce the risk of severe symptoms. You do not need to postpone your appointment if you have mild cold symptoms before getting a flu shot. However, talk with a healthcare provider if you have moderate to severe symptoms.

PhotoQuest / Getty Images The 1918 flu pandemic stands out in history as one of the world’s deadliest—it’s believed to have killed between 1.3 and 3 percent of the human population. But based on doctors’ reports from the time, the disease was peculiar for another reason: It had an unusually high death rate among young adults. Historical accounts and later research suggested the 1918 flu targeted healthy people as well as those with underlying conditions. But based on how infectious diseases today behave—with most deaths occurring among the very young or elderly—this baffled scientists. Now, a new study published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences suggests the 1918 flu may have been more severe for frail or unhealthy people. An analysis of skeletal remains from the time period found that people whose bones showed signs of stress were more likely to die during the pandemic. “This idea that the 1918 flu killed healthy young people is not supported by our findings,” Sharon DeWitte, a co-author of the study and biological anthropologist at the University of Colorado, Boulder, says in a statement from the university. “Instead, we found that this pandemic, like many others across history, disproportionately killed frail people.” “It’s an important study,” Andrew Noymer, an epidemiologist at the University of California, Irvine, who did not contribute to the findings, tells Science’s Mitch Leslie. “This will help set the record straight about the 1918 flu.” The influenza pandemic of 1918 and 1919 was the deadliest flu outbreak of the 20th century. It may have killed as many as 50 to 100 million people, and it infected one in three humans across the planet. Among cities and states that kept data in the United States, the most deaths occurred in young people ages 20 to 34, and pregnant people were the group most likely to die from the flu. To test the idea that healthy and weaker people were equally vulnerable, the researchers turned to a collection of more than 3,000 human skeletons at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History. They examined the bones of 369 people who died before or during the flu outbreak and looked for lesions on shin bones to determine their health—these regions of damage would indicate the person had experienced trauma, infection, malnutrition or some other stressor that would have made them unhealthy, per the statement. Peter Palese, a flu expert at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai who was not involved in the study, tells the New York Times’ Gina Kolata that this method for identifying frailty “is quite legitimate.” The researchers found that people whose bones showed active lesions were more likely to have died during the pandemic than healthy people whose lesions were healed. However, Lone Simonsen, an epidemiologist at Roskilde University in Denmark who was not involved in the research, notes to Science that death rates were not higher among the elderly for the 1918 flu, which would be expected if the flu had targeted frailer people. “We don’t see deaths in the groups where frailty is more common,” Simonsen tells the publication. While further research is needed, the study authors theorize that, like the Covid-19 pandemic, factors like socioeconomic status, institutional racism and access to healthcare could have had an impact on who faced the greatest risks from the flu, per the statement. The takeaway from the study is that “we should never expect any nonaccidental cause of death to be indiscriminate,” DeWitte says to the New York Times.

Even more than 100 years later. And now a pair of researchers — one from the University of Colorado Boulder and another from McMaster University in Canada — are using those skeletal stories to question a conventional wisdom about the 1918 flu pandemic. In a new peer-reviewed study published this week in the journal PNAS, the researchers take on the notion that the 1918 flu was unusually dangerous to the young and healthy. This is a common theme in stories about the pandemic, that it viciously struck down robust people in the prime of life. And this threat of an indiscriminately lethal pathogen has informed pandemic planning ever since. But when the researchers, CU anthropology professor Sharon DeWitte and McMaster anthropology professor Amanda Wissler, studied the bones of people who died in the 1918 pandemic, they found that people exposed to stresses like poor nutrition, pre-existing illness or physical hardship were more likely to die from the pandemic flu than those whose bones showed fewer signs of stress. The most frail, based on an analysis of bone lesions, were 2.7 times more likely to die from the flu. “Honestly, it shouldn’t be surprising because of what we see routinely from various causes of death,” DeWitte said in an interview with The Colorado Sun. University of Colorado Boulder anthropology professor Sharon DeWitte (Provided by CU Boulder) DeWitte is a well-known expert in a field called bioarchaeology — that is, the study of human life in the past through the examination of people’s skeletons. Much of her work has focused on the Black Death and skeletons exhumed from medieval London cemeteries. In that pandemic, too, she found evidence that society’s most frail and vulnerable were disproportionately affected. ☀️ READ MORE Denver Health was losing almost 90% of its nitrous oxide to leaks.

Kent Thiry on the failure of Proposition 131 — which he spent $6M supporting — and how he will move forward A century-old practice allows people to use more than their legal share of Colorado River water. Researchers say it should stop. To answer the question, the researchers looked to the Hamann-Todd Human Osteological Collection, a collection of more than 3,000 human skeletons kept in the basement of the Cleveland Museum of Natural History, each with detailed notes on age and cause of death. The on-site work fell to Wissler, who spent hours in the basement looking for evidence of bone lesions in 369 skeletons that fit their study parameters. (While the research coincidentally took place during the height of the COVID pandemic, it had been thought up well before that virus began circulating.) DeWitte said they were looking specifically for what are called periosteal lesions on people’s shin bones. The lesions can be caused by physical trauma, but also by illness, some nutritional deficiencies and other causes. In bioarchaeology, DeWitte said, such lesions are “often viewed as a nonspecific stress indicator.” Their findings — which the anthropologists caution are ultimately limited by their small sample size — suggest the 1918 pandemic actually worked like a lot of other pandemics, including COVID-19: It was most devastating to the most medically and socially vulnerable. Even though the 1918 pandemic was unusual in having a higher death rate among young adults than typically seen in flu outbreaks, the disparities in who was dying remained. It largely wasn’t people who were otherwise healthy. “The results contradict prior assumptions about selective mortality during the 1918 influenza pandemic,” the two anthropologists wrote in their study. This undated prison hospital underscores that no place — not even lock-up — was safe from the 1918 influenza pandemic. In Denver, cops stopped arresting prostitutes and vagrants in an effort to keep the disease from infecting other inmates. (Courtesy of Denver Public Library) DeWitte said she hopes this knowledge will help public health leaders better prepare for future pandemics. If a narrative were to persist that there are some pandemics that kill indiscriminately, she said, “it sort of fosters complacency about doing anything to prevent horrible outcomes.” Her research, she said, shows there are things that can be done, namely working to improve public health for society’s most vulnerable and better targeting resources to those groups when a pandemic does hit. But, as historic and more recent events have shown, those aren’t policies that are adopted easily. “The COVID-19 pandemic really highlighted for me how the work that I do has relevance to people today,” DeWitte said. “But it’s also depressing because we have these recent pandemics that people are experiencing firsthand and we’re not learning the lessons of the past.” Tagged: archaeology, coronavirus, COVID-19, flu, pandemic, University of Colorado Boulder John IngoldHealth Reporter johningold@coloradosun.com John Ingold is a co-founder of The Colorado Sun and a reporter currently specializing in health care coverage.

Author: Menisa Marshall; Reviewed by Lacey A. Conway, APRN Published: October 13, 2023 | Updated: September 19, 2024 After getting the flu vaccine, some people may feel lousy for a bit, causing them to wonder “can you get the flu from the flu shot?” If you have a mild headache, fever, nausea, muscle aches or fatigue after getting the flu shot, it’s because your body is doing what it should. The vaccine triggers your immune system to gear up to fight off a real infection and that can feel like you have a mild case of the flu. The immune response side effects only last for a day or two. Plenty of water and acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Motrin or Advil) can help relieve side-effects. The flu vaccine uses dead viruses to spark the immune response. You can still get an influenza infection after your annual flu shot, but it’s less likely and with your immune system primed to fight it off, you are less likely to have severe symptoms. The injected flu vaccine is made from dead flu virus or proteins from the flu virus. Neither can cause infection. “Even a healthy person can’t predict how serious a case of the flu might be,” said Lacey A. Conway, APRN, a family medicine provider with Norton Community Medical Associates primary care in Bardstown. “Preventing the flu is the best way to keep from potentially winding up in the hospital, or perhaps the emergency department or an immediate care center.” READ MORE: What is influenza B? Flu Shots and Treatment Flu season runs through March, and while it’s best to get your shot early, the vaccine still can provide protection later in the season. Influenza vaccine is available across Louisville and Southern Indiana. If you think you have the flu, consult with your health care provider, especially if you are immunocompromised. Get vaccinated Get treatment A severe allergic reaction to the flu shot is very rare. If breathing problems, hoarseness or wheezing, hives, paleness, weakness, a fast heartbeat, or dizziness occur it is usually within a few minutes or hours after receiving the influenza vaccine according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. An allergic reaction to the flu vaccine is unlikely, but you should let the medical provider giving you the vaccine that you have a history of allergy or severe reaction to the flu vaccine or a part of the flu vaccine, including an egg allergy. Will nasal Neosporin protect me against the flu? This untrue advice is a spin-off of another internet claim that advises putting an antibacterial such as Neosporin ointment in your nostrils before air travel to zap germs. Any protection offered by an antibiotic ointment would affect only bacteria. A virus causes the flu, so antibacterials are of no help. Do young, healthy people need the influenza vaccine? Current CDC guidelines recommend yearly flu vaccination against for almost everyone 6 months of age and older, including pregnant women. Flu complications can include severe illness and cause hospitalization or death among otherwise healthy children and adults of all ages. Do antibiotics fight flu? The influenza virus will not respond to antibiotics, which affect bacteria, not viruses. Antiviral medications, such as Tamiflu, can help lessen the flu’s impact. Antivirals need to be taken within 48 hours of the first sign of symptoms. Additionally, over-the-counter fever reducers (such as ibuprofen and acetaminophen) and congestion fighters can offer some relief. Can I prevent the flu by washing my hands regularly? Frequent hand washing is one of the best ways to prevent the spread of germs, but hand washing alone cannot keep you from getting the flu. Influenza is spread through the air via saliva droplets that can land on you and get into your nose, mouth and eyes. The flu can live up to eight hours on surfaces, so you can pick it up by touching contaminated surfaces. Do wash your hands often with soap and water, but the No. 1 way to avoid the flu is to get the flu shot. Common flu symptoms include fever, chills, fatigue, cough and muscle or body aches. Some people may have vomiting and diarrhea, however these are more common in children than adults. “If you are mildly ill with flu symptoms, seeing your health provider or visiting an immediate care center are good options,” Lacey said. “The important thing is not to ignore flu symptoms, especially if they seem to be getting worse.” Is it the flu or a cold?

This gives us a warning sign. So we are considering expanding sewage testing to influenza.”Secretary for Health Lo Chung-mau says sewage monitoring for Covid-19 can also be used to predict flu outbreaks.

Professor Ivan Hung Fan-ngai, an infectious diseases expert from the University of Hong Kong, said on Saturday the summer flu cycle was “delayed by the Covid-19 pandemic”.To prepare for the next round, flu jabs for children have been identified as top priority by health adviser Professor David Hui Shu-cheong of Chinese University. He recently urged parents not to ignore such advice, citing experience over the summer months when most children who fell severely ill had not received influenza shots.Tragically, the first child fatality from influenza this year was a previously healthy five-year-old girl who fell ill in mid-September and died days later. 03:44Door-to-door vaccine services for housebound elderly and disabled residents in Hong KongDoor-to-door vaccine services for housebound elderly and disabled residents in Hong KongFlu is also a serious threat to the elderly and other vulnerable groups.

The modified chickens were as healthy as an unedited bird (left). A. Idoko-Akoh et al/Nature Communications 2023 Share this:EmailFacebookTwitterPinterestPocketRedditPrint By Erin Garcia de Jesús October 10, 2023 at 11:00 am Chickens genetically modified to be impervious to bird flu may one day prevent the spread of the disease on farms, a study suggests. Just small tweaks to a single gene made chickens resistant to an avian influenza infection, researchers report October 10 in Nature Communications. The gene, known as ANP32A, provides the instructions that tell chicken cells how to make a protein that flu viruses rely on to successfully hijack cells. Disrupting the avian virus’s ability to commandeer the protein stopped most genetically edited birds from getting infected. Tell us about your Science News experience Help us improve by taking our 15-question reader survey. Take the survey now Testing the gene editing in such a ubiquitous agricultural animal that’s susceptible to bird flu makes the new study “especially impactful and important,” says Jacob Yount, a viral immunologist at Ohio State University in Columbus who wasn’t involved in the research. The virus can rapidly spread among birds on poultry farms, sometimes with devastating consequences. Beginning in 2022, an outbreak hit the global poultry industry hard, pushing farmers to cull millions of birds in the United States alone. After a summer lull, on October 4, a turkey farm in South Dakota confirmed the first case on a U.S. poultry farm since April, affecting around 47,300 birds. While many avian flu strains cause only mild illness in birds, such deadly strains like the one behind the global outbreak can kill domesticated and wild birds (SN: 3/6/23). Chickens also occasionally transmit flu to farm animals like pigs or, less often, people. Ideally genetic editing would completely stop the virus from replicating inside the animals, so it can’t pose a risk to birds, or people, at all. But in the new study, some edited chickens still got infected, meaning the technique isn’t yet 100 percent effective. The new research “isn’t all the way there yet, but I think it’s an amazing first step and an amazing proof of concept,” Yount says. Vaccines to defend poultry from flu exist, but the tactic is expensive, and the virus swiftly adapts to evade that protection, developmental biologist Mike McGrew of the University of Edinburgh said in an October 5 news conference. Gene editing, on the other hand, offers a way to make permanent changes that leave an animal resistant to a particular disease. ANP32A is a good gene to tweak in chickens because it’s “absolutely essential” for the virus’s replication, virologist Wendy Barclay of Imperial College London said at the news conference. In the study, Barclay, McGrew and colleagues made two changes to ANP32A using the molecular scissors CRISPR/Cas9, so that the gene’s protein could no longer interact with avian flu viruses. After monitoring the birds for two years, the edited chickens were healthy, and hens laid eggs normally just like unedited birds, genetic engineer Alewo Idoko-Akoh of the University of Bristol in England said at the news conference. The team then placed 10 normal and 10 gene-edited chicks in separate incubators and exposed them to a dose of around 1,000 infectious particles of avian influenza directly in the nasal cavity. The strain was one that could infect the birds but not make them severely ill. A day later, the two groups of 2-week-old chicks were then each joined by 10 unexposed peers, called sentinels. The unedited birds were paired with unedited sentinels, and gene-edited birds were paired with gene-edited sentinels. All 10 unedited chickens got infected and had high levels of virus in their bodies, and so did seven of their sentinels. Only one of the gene-edited birds contracted the virus. Sponsor Message That infected modified bird had low levels of virus, and it didn’t transmit the virus to any of the edited sentinels. But “we felt that it would be the responsible thing to be more rigorous, to stress test this and ask, are these chickens truly resistant?” Barclay said. So the researchers repeated the experiment, exposing chickens to 1,000 times as much virus as before, about 1 million infectious particles — an abnormally high dose that contains more virus than the birds would likely be exposed to on poultry farms. The team also mixed in both unedited and edited sentinels with exposed chickens. In one incubator, all the normal chickens got infected and transmitted the virus to every unedited sentinel. No edited sentinel birds in that incubator caught the flu. In the other incubator, five of 10 modified chickens became infected after exposure, transmitting the virus to one unedited sentinel but no edited ones. That suggests that even though the virus could infect chicks at high doses, the animals weren’t very contagious. Viruses from the gene-edited chickens that got infected had adapted in ways that allowed the viruses to ditch their reliance on the ANP32A protein and instead co-opt two other proteins in the same family to replicate. That means editing more than one gene may be necessary to make chickens fully resistant to flu. “If this was a disease that only infected chickens, then the resistance that we created would be better than what we would get with a vaccine,” McGrew said. “But because this is a zoonotic disease and can be spread potentially to humans, we really need to aim for complete resistance.” Eliminating all three ANP32 genes from chicken cells grown in a lab dish stopped the virus from replicating at all. But because having at least some ANP32 proteins may be important for developing chick brains, bones and hearts, that strategy might cause problems for live chickens. More work is needed to figure out if that is true, Yount says, and whether other genes outside of the ANP32 family might also be good candidates for editing. The use of genetically modified organisms in agriculture is not without controversy (SN: 1/29/16). But it’s important to continue such work in chickens, Idoko-Akoh said, “so that then when maybe it becomes widely or more culturally accepted, we can take advantage of the technology.” Questions or comments on this article?

Facebook Twitter Instagram RSS Email HEALTH Skeletons from 1918 flu pandemic reveal clues about those most likely to die, study finds New research seems to contradict a long-standing belief that young, healthy people were most at risk By Melissa Rudy Fox News Published October 13, 2023 5:00am EDT Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video WHO member warns of 'additional pandemics' if we don't learn from COVID Former World Health Organization expert committee member Jamie Metzl joins 'America's Newsroom' after the Biden White House missed the Sunday deadline to declassify documents on the origin of COVID-19. The skeletons of people who were alive during the 1918 flu pandemic have revealed new clues about people who were more likely to die from the virus. Known as the deadliest in history, the 1918 flu pandemic — also referred to as the Spanish flu — killed an estimated 50 million people.It’s long been assumed that the 1918 flu primarily affected young, healthy adults — but a new study published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences seems to contradict that, suggesting that frail or unhealthy people were more vulnerable. DOCTORS URGE VACCINATIONS AHEAD OF THIS YEAR'S FLU SEASON, WHICH COULD BE 'FAIRLY BAD,' EXPERTS SAY Researchers from McMaster University in Canada and the University of Colorado Boulder examined the skeletal remains of 369 individuals housed at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History. All of these individuals died either soon before or during the 1918 pandemic, according to a press release from McMaster. The sample was divided into two groups: a control group who had died before the pandemic; and another group who died during the pandemic, according to the release. An emergency hospital at Camp Funston, Kansas, is shown during the 1918 influenza pandemic. New research contradicts the widespread belief that the flu disproportionately impacted healthy young adults. (National Museum of Health and Medicine, Otis Historical Archives New Contributed Photo Collection/Wikimedia Commons)They examined the bones for lesions that would have indicated stress or inflammation, which could have been caused by physical trauma, infection or malnutrition, the release stated. "By comparing who had lesions, and whether these lesions were active or healing at the time of death, we get a picture of what we call frailty, or who is more likely to die," said Sharon DeWitte, a biological anthropologist at the University of Colorado Boulder and co-author on the study. "Our study shows that people with these active lesions are the most frail." FLU PREVENTION TIPS FROM FLORIDA'S SURGEON GENERAL: A 'DAY-TO-DAY’ HEALTHY LIFESTYLE IS KEY Lead study author Amanda Wissler, an assistant professor in the Department of Anthropology at McMaster, said the study highlights how cultural, social and biological circumstances affect the likelihood of death. "Even in a novel pandemic — one to which no one is supposed to have prior immunity — certain people are at a greater risk of getting sick and dying, and this is often shaped by culture," she said in an interview with Fox News Digital. A demonstration is shown at the Red Cross Emergency Ambulance Station in Washington, D.C., during the influenza pandemic of 1918. (Getty Images)The researcher noted that this same phenomenon was seen during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. "The news was full of reports about how people who had been minoritized, or [had] decreased access to social services, often had greater rates of getting very sick or dying," she said."‘Healthy’ people are not supposed to die. We have a term called ‘selective mortality,’ which says that certain people are more likely to die than others." The findings of the study were not surprising to the researchers, Wissler said."‘Healthy’ people are not supposed to die," she said. "We have a term called ‘selective mortality,’ which says that certain people are more likely to die than others." COVID-19 PATIENTS FACE INCREASED HEALTH RISKS FOR UP TO 2 YEARS, STUDY FINDS "Many studies have found that certain people are more likely to die in all kinds of contexts, including other pandemics like the Black Death, and also in natural disasters," the researcher continued. "I would actually have been somewhat surprised if people who were healthy had a greater risk of death in 1918."Study had some limitations One key limitation of the study, according to Wissler, is that the researchers only had information on people who died from the pandemic — but none on people who got infected but survived."We don’t know if being unhealthy or stressed may have caused a person to be more likely to [have been] infected with the 1918 flu," she said. A demonstration is shown at the Red Cross Emergency Ambulance Station in Washington, D.C., during the influenza pandemic of 1918. (Getty Images) Additionally, the individuals who were studied all came from Cleveland, Ohio, Wissler noted. "This study only provides a snapshot of a certain time and place of the experience of the 1918 flu," she said. "We don’t know yet if what we found here can be generalized to every city." COVID-19, FLU AND RSV VACCINES ARE ALL AVAILABLE THIS FALL: SEE WHAT SOME DOCTORS RECOMMEND AND WHY MarkAlain Déry, DO, an infectious disease physician in New Orleans, noted that the study raises some questions. He was not involved in the research.Initially, Déry said he was "super excited" about the new research, which highlighted "that people who experience health inequities have higher rates of illness and mortality." To protect against today’s strains of influenza, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that everyone 6 months and older get an annual vaccination. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images)The research is "more or less saying what we already know, which is that people in vulnerable communities and in lower socioeconomic statuses have a greater level of frailty and mortality as a result of the 1918 influenza outbreak," Déry said. The key issue, however, is that it’s not known whether the people who were examined died of influenza, he pointed out. Also, the size of the study was relatively small, he said.CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER Overall, the researchers noted that the project highlights the importance of studying the past.

(Joe Burbank/The Associated Press)Social SharingBritish Columbia has launched its immunization campaign for this year's respiratory illness season, with influenza and COVID-19 vaccinations now available in pharmacies across the province.The immunization plan was announced late last month as Provincial Health Officer Bonnie Henry reintroduced mask mandates in the province's health-care settings with respiratory illnesses trending upward.Dr. Monika Naus, medical director of immunization programs and vaccine preventable diseases service at the B.C. Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC) said people who very recently had a confirmed COVID-19 infection can forgo the fall COVID booster, but should still get the flu shot."COVID infection won't buy any protection against influenza. These vaccines are very specific," said Naus. "In general, if you've had COVID ... the natural infection will boost your immunity. ... There shouldn't be any need to get a dose of the COVID vaccine this fall if you've just had an infection."WATCH | BCCDC's Dr. Monika Naus talks about fall immunizations on B.C. Today: In a written statement, drugstore chain Pharmasave says it is anticipating an increase in demand for vaccines administered by pharmacies this year, as patients have increasingly turned to pharmacists for treating common ailments since the province authorized it in June.The BCCDC said COVID-19 hospitalizations have risen by 58 per cent for the two weeks starting Sept. 21, with 24 deaths in the last week of September alone.COVID-19 hospitalizations up 58% in B.C., as number of infections, deaths also spikeIn the second week of August, B.C. reported nine COVID-19 deaths.The BCCDC says new infections are also on the rise, from 133 cases during the second week of August to 877 cases in the last week of September, with a notable increase in patients age 60 and older.The B.C. government's COVID-19 immunization webpage says invitations to book an appointment for the COVID and flu vaccines will be sent out by email and text to those who have previously received a shot. Invitations will be sent to priority groups first, including those age 65 and older, residents in long-term care facilities, Indigenous people, pregnant people, health-care workers and people with chronic health conditions, the website says.Second OpinionHow seniors can access 4 key vaccines this fall — for COVID, flu, pneumonia, and RSVB.C. residents can also call the provincial call centre's Get Vaccinated system — at 1-833-838-2323 — to book their appointments, according to the health ministry.In addition, some B.C. pharmacies may be offering the COVID-19 and influenza shots at walk-in clinics. A health ministry spokesperson says residents can use these clinics to get their shot, as long as it has been six months since their last COVID-19 dose."While it is always best to use the call centre or Get Vaccinated System to book your appointment, individual pharmacies may book an appointment for their customers directly with the pharmacy, using the Get Vaccinated system," the spokesperson said."This however will depend on availability and as long as the person is eligible for their COVID-19 vaccine (six months after their previous dose)."With files from Canadian Press and Charis HoggCBC's Journalistic Standards and Practices|About CBC NewsCorrections and clarifications|Submit a news tip|Report errorRelated Stories Top stories from British Columbia Vancouver man among dead in Israel following Hamas attacks, MP says Hundreds show up for pro-Palestinian rally in Vancouver New, fast-growing wildfire threatens more than 2 dozen properties in northeastern B.C.Footer LinksMy AccountProfileCBC GemNewslettersAbout CBC AccountsConnect with CBCFacebookXYouTubeInstagramMobileRSSPodcastsContact CBCSubmit FeedbackHelp CentreAudience Relations, CBC P.O.

Avian influenza, known as bird flu, has been around for decades but in 2020 a new highly pathogenic strain emerged (HPAI H5N1), resulting in severe disease and high mortality rates. If a colony shows any signs of bird flu, the area will be closed down. Photo: Richard Youd There have been no identified cases in Antarctica to date, but according to the Council of Managers of National Antarctic Programs (COMNAP), bird flu has been detected in birds and mammals in South America, South Africa and the Arctic “so the risk is heightened that HPAI will make its way to Antarctica by way of natural migration of species during the 2023/24 or the 2024/25 Antarctic seasons.” Seabird ecologist Dr Louise Emmerson said the disease was highly transmittable between birds and was expected to arrive in the Falkland Islands, not far from Antarctica, when the migratory species returned to their breeding colonies. “There are a range of bird species that have been affected and we know it can affect penguins as well as flying seabirds. Concerningly, it has also been found to occur in seals and rarely in humans.” she said. “There are some colonies where it’s wiped out 75 per cent of the population so it is a very significant virus. There have literally been deaths of many hundreds of thousands of birds from this virus. “Basically, this year our recommendation is to keep away from wildlife in Antarctica. Normally we would suggest expeditioners could sit quietly and enjoy the opportunity of a curious penguin coming close as long as they didn't approach the penguin, but this year it is important to keep a distance. “We’ll be running a monitoring program from back here (in Hobart) where we’ll ask expeditioners from all three Australian Antarctic research stations to take video footage to send to us, and we’ll have a look at it. “We are also sending seabird research teams to Antarctica where they can take a closer look at the birds and make a call based on their extensive experience working with and around them and knowing what normal bird behaviour and colonies look like.”. “If there’s any sign of sick or dying birds that we suspect is avian influenza, then we’ll close that area.” ‘We will be disinfecting boots, equipment and clothing’ The most likely way the disease would arrive in Antarctica is via a migratory bird but there is also risk of transmission from humans. Special measures are being taken this year to prevent that. “Through the Australian Antarctic Program, we’re maintaining extra vigilance so that any of the equipment we’re sending down with expeditioners is not going to have avian influenza on it," Dr Emmerson said. “We will also be disinfecting boots, equipment and clothing between sites to ensure there is no risk of us spreading it if it’s there.” To protect both birds and humans, AAD seabird research teams in Antarctica will wear extra protective clothing, face masks and eye protection when they are close to colonies or working with the birds and will only conduct research in areas where there is no visual sign of the virus. The National Science Foundation in the US has released similar guidelines for people working with the US Antarctic Program, advising expeditioners to decontaminate equipment and refrain from spending too much time on the ground near wildlife. It lists symptoms of the virus in birds and mammals as trembling of the head and body, closed or excessively watery eyes, lethargy and loss of balance. “While we will be keeping a close eye for any signs of avian influenza, our research focus this year is on how the seabirds respond to record low sea-ice, and whether the Adélie penguin populations in the Mawson area have showed any signs of recovery since a recent dramatic decline,” Dr Emmerson said. In Chile, more than 3,000 sea lion deaths have been attributed to avian influenza Photo: Andrew Lowther International Antarctic programs working together The team will be attaching GPS and satellite loggers to the birds to understand where the penguins and petrels are foraging and whether their dive behaviour has changed. Scats will also be collected to see what they have been eating. “We haven’t had access to this area since we recorded the penguin population decline so we are very keen to understand what has happened since,” Dr Emmerson said. “Our concern is that even if the population has started to recover, the arrival of avian influenza in the coming years could again put enormous pressure on these birds. “In this year though, the research plans would come to a halt if there are signs of avian influenza. The things we’ll be keeping an eye out for are, have there been changes in their behaviour? Is there any unusual mortality? Is there any mucus or anything that doesn’t look right? “Then we’ll be going through a procedure, consistent with the other national Antarctic programs, to stop work in that area. “It’s an Antarctic-wide initiative.” Researchers will wear extra protective clothing when they get near bird colonies in Antarctica this year.

Photo by Colin Tsuboi/ Mass Media Staff. Robert Pomales, the Executive Director of University Health Services, announced that UMass Boston has partnered with Star Market to offer free vaccines to all students, staff and faculty. These vaccines include the seasonal influenza vaccine and an up-to-date COVID-19 vaccine. [1] In an email to the student body, Pomales stated: “University Health Services, Massachusetts Department of Public Health, and the Centers for Disease Control recommend a yearly flu vaccine and an up-to-date COVID vaccine as an important step in protecting yourself against the flu virus and Coronavirus.” [1] Free vaccines on campus are available in the Campus Center, on the Upper Level in the main lobby. The vaccine clinics are scheduled to be open for Wednesday, Oct. 11, from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m., and Monday, Oct. 23, from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. [1] Pomales has also stated that additional dates for vaccine clinics are being arranged, with notifications containing specific dates, times and locations set to be released to the student body in the coming weeks. This proactive approach ensures that all members of the university community have ample opportunities to receive vaccines at their convenience. [1] Not only is Star Market partnering with UMass Boston to provide free vaccines, but you can go to Star Market directly to book a free vaccine appointment and get discounts for groceries in the process. “We make it easy to help protect your family during flu season. Schedule your vaccine or stop by today, walk-ins welcome! For added convenience, select locations offer drive-up flu clinics,” states Star Market’s website. [2] What makes this initiative even more appealing is the added incentive from Star Market. Beyond the convenience of getting vaccinated on campus, students and staff members can directly book free vaccine appointments at their nearest Star Market locations. Individuals receiving their influenza vaccines through Star Market will be rewarded with a coupon that entitles them to a ten percent discount on their grocery purchases. [2] Those who are looking to receive an influenza vaccine can get one in a few different ways. Star Market pharmacies offer a variety of choices, including walk-in appointments, scheduled appointments, and even the added convenience of drive-up clinics at select locations. For those who require additional vaccinations, such as the RSV vaccine, it’s worth noting that these can be administered along with the influenza or COVID-19 vaccine. [2] Commonly asked questions about the influenza vaccine and influenza season have been answered on Star Market’s website. “In the United States, flu season usually occurs in the fall and winter. While influenza viruses spread year-round, flu activity often begins to increase in October. Most of the time, flu activity peaks between December and February according to the CDC.” [2] “Flu shots are made with either inactivated (killed) viruses, or with only a single protein from the flu virus. The CDC says flu vaccines cannot cause flu illness,” states Star Market’s website. “The body’s immunity to influenza viruses (acquired either through natural infection or vaccination) declines over time. According to the CDC, getting vaccinated each year provides the best protection against flu throughout flu season.” [2] Different types of influenza vaccines are recommended for use in the United States, as well as different doses. For ages 18 and older, the CDC recommends the Quadrivalent Recombinant Flu Vaccine, which protects against four different strains of influenza. For ages 65 and older, the CDC recommends the Flu Vaccine for 65+, which is only licensed in high-dose, inactivated influenza vaccines and holds a stronger immune response.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture reported that avian influenza (bird flu), which is deadly to commercial poultry, was confirmed in a flock of 47,300 turkeys in Jerauld County of South Dakota last Wednesday, Oct. 4, 2023, and at a farm with 141,800 birds in Sanpete County of Utah last Friday, Oct. 6. | Photo Credit: AP Scientists in Britain have found they can partially protect chickens from bird flu infections by editing their genes, signalling a new potential strategy to reduce the spread of the deadly virus.Highly pathogenic avian influenza, known as bird flu, has spread to new corners of the globe since 2022, wiping out millions of poultry birds and sending egg and turkey prices soaring.Experts warn that mutations could potentially threaten a human pandemic, though the current strain has not caused significant disease in people.Researchers said they used the gene-editing tool CRISPR to make specific changes to a gene called ANP32 that is essential to support flu viruses inside chickens' cells. CRISPR is a type of molecular "scissor" technology that scientists can use to edit DNA.Also Read | Mammalian spread of H5N1 and its pandemic potential Flu viruses hijack proteins like ANP32 inside cells to help themselves replicate, and the edits in chickens were designed to stop the growth of bird flu.Upticks in cases tend to occur during the spring and autumn migration of wild birds that transmit the virus, and the U.S. last week reported its first case in a commercial flock since April.Experiments showed that almost all of the gene-edited chickens showed resistance to lower doses of a less lethal form of bird flu than the H5N1 strain that has circulated the globe recently, said Wendy Barclay, a flu expert and professor at the Imperial College of London.When birds were exposed to much higher levels of the virus, though, about half of the gene-edited chickens had breakthrough infections, she said.Also Read | Most avian flu outbreaks in India reported from post-monsoon to pre-summer season: study"We can move toward making chickens resistant to the virus but we're not there yet," Barclay said. "We would need more edits - more robust edits - to really shut down the virus replication."The findings were published in Nature Communications on Tuesday.Researchers now think that making three specific genetic changes to chickens' cells will better protect birds. However, they have not bred chickens with three edits yet, said Helen Sang, who previously studied genetically modifying chickens against bird flu at the University of Edinburgh.Sang said scientists found that genetic modification would not work well enough.Unlike genetic modification, which introduces foreign genes, gene editing alters existing genes. The technology is considered to be less controversial than genetic modification and is more lightly regulated in some countries."The way forwards here is not to rely on single edits but to use a combination of them," Barclay said.France this month became the first country in the European Union to vaccinate poultry against the virus.However, that strategy led the U.S. to impose trade restrictions on French poultry imports, citing a risk of introducing the virus into the country because vaccinated birds may not show signs of infection.

Scientists genetically engineer CHICKENS that are resistant to avian influenzaGene editing proof-of-concept is designed to prevent spread between chickensSome scientists are already concerned that bird flu could be the next pandemicBy JONATHAN CHADWICK FOR MAILONLINE Published: 16:00 GMT, 10 October 2023 | Updated: 16:00 GMT, 10 October 2023 e-mail 62 shares 97 View comments Gene editing techniques could stop the spread of bird flu among chickens and reduce the risk of it making the jump to humans, a new study shows. British scientists have used CRISPR-Cas9, a powerful gene-editing tool, to restrict – but not completely block – the bird flu virus from infecting chickens. Introducing lab-grown, gene-edited chickens to farms could curb the spread of the disease, which has cost the UK poultry industry more than £100 million. Although the team's method is only designed to prevent bird flu spreading from chicken to chicken, it could also reduce the risk of chicken-to-human transmissions.Only in rare instances do strains of bird flu – also known as avian influenza – pass to humans, although experts are concerned that an outbreak could be the next big pandemic. The ongoing UK bird flu outbreak - caused by the H5N1 strain - has seen up to one million birds struck down by the virus Scientists edited the ANP32A gene in chicken germ cells (precursors of reproductive cells) to restrict bird flu. They found that fully-grown chickens were resistant to a dose of the virus What is gene editing? Genome editing enables scientists to make changes to DNA, leading to changes in physical traits. Scientists use different technologies to do this. These technologies act like scissors, cutting the DNA at a specific spot. Then scientists can remove, add, or replace the DNA where it was cut.The first genome editing technologies were developed in the late 1900s. More recently, a new genome editing tool called CRISPR, invented in 2009, has made it easier than ever to edit DNA. Source: US National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) Advertisement The new research was led by scientists at the University of Edinburgh, Imperial College London and the Pirbright Institute in Surrey. 'Bird flu is a great threat to bird populations,' said principal investigator Professor Mike McGrew, from the University of Edinburgh's Roslin Institute. 'Vaccination against the virus poses a number of challenges, with significant practical and cost issues associated with vaccine deployment. 'Gene editing offers a promising route towards permanent disease resistance, which could be passed down through generations, protecting poultry and reducing the risks to humans and wild birds.' Gene editing alters an organism's DNA in ways that could be inherited by subsequent generations. Several gene-editing techniques allow genetic material to be added, removed, or altered at particular locations in the genome, the entire set of DNA instructions found in a cell. For the project, the scientists used the renowned genome editing tool CRISPR-Cas9, which is used for making precise edits in DNA.CRISPR-Cas9 has been likened to a pair of genetic scissors, allowing for tiny snippets of DNA to be removed and replaced. CRISPR is a DNA-editing technique in which scientists can programme a molecule to target and 'snip' a specific section or element of someone's genetic material (file photo, not to scale) READ MORE UK should be preparing for bird flu pandemic The ongoing UK bird flu outbreak, caused by the H5N1 strain, has seen up to one million birds struck down by the virus Advertisement They edited the section of DNA responsible for producing a protein called ANP32A in chicken germ cells (precursors of reproductive cells). During an infection, flu viruses hijack ANP32A to help replicate themselves. Once fully grown in the lab, 10 gene-edited chickens were exposed to a normal dose of a strain of the virus that causes bird flu. Researchers found that the vast majority of chickens – nine out of 10 – remained uninfected and there was no spread to other chickens.The birds showed no signs that the change in their DNA had any impact on their health or egg-laying, according to the team. To further test the birds' resilience, the scientists then exposed the gene-edited birds to a much higher dose of the virus.When exposed to the high dose, half of the group – five out of 10 birds – became infected, although the gene edit did provide some protection.They found the amount of virus in the infected gene-edited chickens was much lower than the level typically seen during infection in non-gene-edited chickens.Crucially, the gene edit also helped to limit onward spread of the virus to just one of four normal, non-gene-edited chickens placed in the same incubator. This highlights the potential of the edit to stop the spread of bird flu amongst normal non-edited populations of chickens. As expected, there was no transmission from a gene-edited bird to another gene-edited bird. Left, a normal hen and right, a gene-edited hen from the experiments. The authors say: 'Chickens genetically resistant to avian influenza could prevent future outbreaks' Bird flu is a major global threat, with a devastating impact in both farmed and wild bird populations. In the UK alone, the current outbreak of H5N1 bird flu has decimated seabird populations and cost the poultry industry more than £100 million in losses. Pictured, a National Trust ranger clears dead birds from Staple Island, Northumberland, in July 2022Researchers say additional genetic changes would be needed for the virus to infect and spread effectively in humans, brought on by mutations. Currently, no human-to-human transmission has yet been detected in the UK, but some Brits have tested positive for the disease. Professor James Wood at the University of Cambridge's veterinary medicine department said the new work demonstrates 'significant but not absolute resistance of chickens to bird flu'.'This study provides an important proof of principle for the genetic control of avian influenza and its transmission between chickens,' said Professor Wood, who was not involved with the study.'[It] provides important proof of principle of the utility of utilising gene editing in introducing genetic resistance to disease caused by influenza in farmed animals. 'The use of gene edited, disease resistant chickens in farming would be an exciting advance, and the pyramidal structure of the global poultry industry could allow rapid introduction of these influenza resistant chickens across many countries and continents.'Findings would need first to be demonstrated on a larger scale before introduction into commercial farming.'The study is published in the journal Nature Communications. Bird flu outbreak: Everything you need to know What is it?Avian flu is an infectious type of influenza that spreads among birds.In rare cases, it can be transmitted to humans through close contact with a dead or alive infected bird.This includes touching infected birds, their droppings or bedding. People can also catch bird flu if they kill or prepare infected poultry for eating.Wild birds are carriers, especially through migration.As they cluster together to breed, the virus spreads rapidly and is then carried to other parts of the globe.New strains tend to appear first in Asia, from where more than 60 species of shore birds, waders and waterfowl head off to Alaska to breed and mix with migratory birds from the US. Others go west and infect European species.Which strains are currently spreading?H5N1 and H3N8.So far the virus H5N1 has been detected in some 80 million birds and poultry globally since September 2021 - double the previous record the year before.Not only is the virus spreading at speed, it is also killing at an unprecedented level, leading some experts to say this is the deadliest variant so far.Millions of chickens and turkeys in the UK have been culled or put into lockdown.But earlier this year, on March 27, the World Health Organization (WHO) was also informed that a Chinese woman had become the first person to ever die from the H3N8 strain.The 56-year-old woman from the southern province of Guangdong was the third person known to have been infected with the H3N8 subtype of avian influenza, according to the WHO. Although rare in people, H3N8 is common in birds, but it causes little to no sign of disease. It has also infected other mammals. Can bird flu infect people?Yes, but only 873 human cases of bird flu have been reported to the World Health Organization since 2003.The risk to people has been deemed 'low'.But people are strongly urged not to touch sick or dead birds because the virus is lethal, killing 56 per cent of people it does manage to infect.

The short answer: Yes, it's fine to exercise as long as you feel well enough. For example, COVID-19 and seasonal flu vaccines may cause mild side effects, such as fever, headache, and pain at the injection site. There are benefits and risks of post-vaccination exercise. Some evidence suggests that light-to-moderate exercise may boost your immune response after a vaccine. Still, side effects may hinder and lower the overall quality of your workout. It's best to know the possible side effects of vaccination and how to plan your physical activity around your vaccine to feel as good as possible. Here's what you need to know about exercising after getting a vaccine. Flashpop / Getty Images Is It Safe to Exercise After a Vaccine? It's generally safe to exercise after getting a vaccine. There's no evidence that exercising right before or right after the vaccine would impact a vaccine's effectiveness, Humberto Choi, MD, a pulmonologist at Cleveland Clinic, told Health. Whether you feel well enough to exercise after getting a vaccine depends on what side effects you have. "There's no stopping you from exercising after getting the vaccine if you can tolerate the side effects," Aditya Shah, MD, an infectious disease specialist and hospitalist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., told Health. Vaccines, including the COVID-19 and seasonal flu vaccines, may cause side effects like: FeverHeadacheMuscle aches and painPain, redness, and swelling on the arm where you got the vaccine Those side effects might impact your ability to do daily activities, including working out, but that's not a bad thing. They are ultimately a sign that your immune system is responding to the vaccine, David Wyles, MD, an infectious disease specialist at Denver Health, told Health. Over-the-counter (OTC) medications, such as Advil (ibuprofen), aspirin, or Tylenol (acetaminophen), can treat side effects. Taking one of those medications may help you feel better and up for a workout, said Dr. Wyles. Talk to a healthcare provider if you are unsure whether those medications are safe after getting a vaccine. How Long Before I Can Exercise After a Vaccine? Getting a vaccine will probably not disrupt your workout routine. Some people have mild side effects that go away within a few days and do not interrupt their daily activities, including exercise. Others may want to take a few days off from working out while they recover. As a rule of thumb, listen to your body, said Dr. Wyles. Take a rest day or two if you do not feel well enough to exercise post-vaccination. Forcing yourself to break a sweat when you're not feeling good is "counterproductive," Sivan Fagan, CPT, a strength and nutrition coach, told Health. "You're not going to be able to perform your best," said Fagan. Is Working Out While Sick Safe? Possible Risks and Side-Effects There are minimal risks of exercising after a vaccine. It's impossible to predict how your body will respond to a vaccine. Possible risks and side effects may include: Adverse side effects: Contact a healthcare provider if the redness or pain where you got a vaccine worsens after 24 hours, or if your side effects do not go away after a few days. Although rare, seek medical attention right away if you think you are having a severe allergic reaction to the vaccine. Fainting: This is a possible side effect of many vaccines, including the COVID-19 and seasonal flu vaccines. A study published in 2022 looked at six cases of fainting, which occurred within 10–40 minutes of COVID-19 vaccination. Your risk of injury may increase if you exercise right away after getting a vaccine. Side effects may cause a low-quality workout: This may result in a less enjoyable workout overall. The side effects of getting a vaccine can be annoying and uncomfortable. Still, they are very mild compared to being sick, said Dr. Choi. Younger adults typically have side effects more frequently than others, said Dr. Wyles. Some evidence suggests their immune systems react to COVID-19 vaccines more vigorously than older adults. The second dose of Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines may also cause more intense side effects than the first. When To Avoid Exercise It often takes weeks to develop immunity after getting a vaccine. For example, you are not "fully vaccinated" until two weeks after getting a COVID-19 vaccine, said Dr. Shah. Make sure to wait those two weeks if you have plans for an indoor, maskless workout at a facility requiring vaccination. It's still essential to maintain basic public health precautions, like frequently washing your hands and staying home if you are sick, even if fully vaccinated, added Dr. Shah. Avoid working out in public spaces if you develop COVID-19 or flu symptoms, such as: A new loss of smell or tasteCoughFatigueFeverGastrointestinal (GI) symptoms (i.e., diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting)HeadacheMuscle or body achesRunny or stuffy noseSore throatTrouble breathing COVID-19 vaccines do not infect you with the virus, but it's possible to contract COVID-19 near the time of your vaccination. Pause your workout plans and receive a test right away if you have COVID-19 symptoms. Does the Type of Exercise Matter? You might opt for a gentle version of your standard workout, depending on the intensity and type of your side effects. For example, you can go for a long walk instead of a high-intensity workout if you feel a little sluggish. You might modify a full-body strength workout into a core and leg-focused routine if your arm is achy. It's best not to make concrete workout plans since there's no way to know exactly how your body will respond to a vaccine. Instead, plan your workouts depending on how you feel after a vaccine. Gentle Upper Body Exercises Research has found that gentle upper body exercises may reduce pain and redness on the arm where you got the vaccine. For example, you might try doing some shoulder circles or presses. Here's how to do shoulder circles: Face your palms forward, then lift one arm to a 90-degree angle. Gently rotate your arm backward and forward 20 times each. Repeat on the opposite side. Follow these steps to do shoulder presses: Lift one arm to your shoulder height, your palms facing forward. Bend your elbow to a 90-degree angle. Gently extend your arm upward, then return to the starting position. Complete 10 reps, then repeat on the opposite side. Are There Any Benefits? Research has found that post-vaccination exercise may boost your immune response by increasing the number of antibodies your body produces. The evidence is conflicting, though, and some research has found that exercise does not benefit vaccine efficacy. A study published in 2022 found that a single 90-minute session of light-to-moderate indoor cycling or outdoor walking and jogging upped antibody response within four weeks of COVID-19 and seasonal flu vaccination. The researchers noted that exercise is an acute stressor that may boost your immune response before and after vaccination. Physical activity also induces an inflammatory response. Inflammation may activate more antigen-presenting cells (APCs) than usual. ACPs are immune cells that help fight off infections. Does Exercise Boost Your Immune System? A Quick Review It's OK to exercise after getting a vaccine if you feel up to it. Gentle upper body exercises may reduce pain and redness at the injection site. Some evidence even suggests that light-to-moderate cycling, jogging, or walking may actually boost your immune response to a vaccine. Just let your body be your guide and scale things back as needed. Some people may need a day or two to recover from the side effects of a vaccine, such as fever, headache, and muscle pain. The information in this story is accurate as of press time.

Wet markets are among the known risk factors for spillover events Credit: TANG CHHIN SOTHY/AFP via Getty Images The Lancet commission – which includes 28 experts from every continent – aims to identify and develop risk spillover mitigation policies that are both doable and effective. “We know, more or less, the biological mechanisms that drive disease transmission,” Prof Dirk Pfeiffer, a veterinary epidemiologist at the City University of Hong Kong and member of the new commission, told the Telegraph. “What we struggle with is the human behaviour aspect – it’s hard to control because it depends on economic drivers, cultural drivers, that vary so much across the planet… but we need to come up with sophisticated responses that actually deal with the underlying causes to reduce the frequencies of these outbreaks, and detect them early.” Dead child ‘played in chicken yard’Two deaths in Cambodia this week have reinforced the constant threat posed by zoonotic diseases. On Monday, a two-year-old in the southeastern province of Prey Veng died after contracting H5N1 avian influenza. It comes after the Ministry of Health announced on Sunday that a 50-year-old man in neighbouring Svay Rieng province died from the virus. It is not yet clear if the cases are linked, but reports suggest dead chickens had been found in the villages where both victims lived. “I presume that she may have become infected with the virus when she played in the yard, as she normally did, where the chickens had been,” the little girl’s mother, Chhuon Srey Mao, told the Associated Press – adding that she started vomiting, with a cough and high temperature, in early October. She later died at a children’s hospital in the capital city. Prof Pfeiffer said incidents like this demonstrate the very real risks posed by animal diseases, and the need to do more to limit the threat posed by spillovers. “Disease transmission events will continue to happen, but we need to try to reduce their frequencies, detect them early,” he said. But he added that strategies should not be specific to individual pathogens.“In the 2000s, we all thought avian flu from chickens would be the next pandemic, and we enhanced our surveillance systems and vaccines were developed – but different diseases have taken us in completely unexpected directions,” Dr Pfeiffer said.“So we need to go beyond focusing on a single pathogen – this is about understanding ecosystems and behaviour and developing realistic, deployable strategies that will reduce the frequency and severity of these transmission events.” The Lancet Commission panellists said they would start by assessing strategies already proposed – from curbing deforestation to ramping up biosecurity at wet markets and improving access to healthcare for rural communities in close proximity to wildlife. Within the next three years, the group aims to develop a more comprehensive picture of these and other possible approaches to curb spillover events, from both a disease perspective and a cost-benefit analysis. “Spillover prevention is a topic that is poorly understood and largely unaddressed by major institutions working in public health,” said Dr Raina Plowright, co-chair of the Commission. “Our Commission will improve our understanding of disease threats. We need to shine a bright spotlight on this problem and then provide a strategy to solve it.”Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Advertisement More stories More from Global Health Security Libya introduces Taliban-style morality police to crack down on women’s dress and ‘strange’ haircuts The international community’s failure on Sudan has shocked me to my core Teenager hospitalised with bird flu Iraq to lower the ‘age of consent’ for girls to nine New case of dangerous mpox strain brings UK total to four ‘Go wild, Robert’: what Trump’s victory means for global health More from The Telegraph The Telegraph Back to top Follow us on: Facebook icon Instagram icon X icon Snapchat icon LinkedIn icon YouTube icon Download the Telegraph App Help Centre About us Telegraph Extra Reader Prints Branded Content Syndication and Commissioning Fantasy Sport UK Voucher Codes Betting Offers Tax Strategy Broadband and Mobile Deals Newsletters Privacy Terms & Conditions Modern Slavery Advertising terms Guidelines The Chelsea Magazine Company © Telegraph Media Group Holdings Limited 2024Deadly bird flu reappears in US commercial poultry flocks in Utah and South Dakota | KUER Search Query Show Search Schedule Weekly Schedule KUER-2: BBC KUER-3: Classical KUER KUER-4: Avanza Printable Schedule Weekly Schedule KUER-2: BBC KUER-3: Classical KUER KUER-4: Avanza Printable Schedule News Latest News Science & Environment Politics & Government Business & Economy Education Health Race, Religion & Social Justice Southern Utah News Send Us A Tip En Español Latest News Science & Environment Politics & Government Business & Economy Education Health Race, Religion & Social Justice Southern Utah News Send Us A Tip En Español Shows RadioWest RadioWest Films State Street TreeNote Utah News Now More KUER Podcasts RadioWest RadioWest Films State Street TreeNote Utah News Now More KUER Podcasts How To Listen Mobile App Frequencies Smart Speakers Audio Streaming Help Report A Signal Outage Mobile App Frequencies Smart Speakers Audio Streaming Help Report A Signal Outage Connect About Staff Contact Social Media Feedback Form About Staff Contact Social Media Feedback Form Support Ways To Give Sponsorship Major Giving Planned Giving Vehicle Donation Foundations myKUER Ways To Give Sponsorship Major Giving Planned Giving Vehicle Donation Foundations myKUER Events Community Calendar Submit A PSA/Event KUER Events Community Calendar Submit A PSA/Event KUER Events Newsletters KUER Morning Brief RadioWest State Street KUER Morning Brief RadioWest State Street © 2024 KUER 90.1 Menu Show Search Search Query Donate Play Live Radio Next Up: 0:00 0:00 0:00 0:00 Available On Air Stations On Air Now Playing KUER 90.1, NPR Utah On Air Now Playing KUER-2: BBC World Service On Air Now Playing KUER-3: Classical KUER On Air Now Playing KUER-4: Avanza All Streams Schedule Weekly Schedule KUER-2: BBC KUER-3: Classical KUER KUER-4: Avanza Printable Schedule Weekly Schedule KUER-2: BBC KUER-3: Classical KUER KUER-4: Avanza Printable Schedule News Latest News Science & Environment Politics & Government Business & Economy Education Health Race, Religion & Social Justice Southern Utah News Send Us A Tip En Español Latest News Science & Environment Politics & Government Business & Economy Education Health Race, Religion & Social Justice Southern Utah News Send Us A Tip En Español Shows RadioWest RadioWest Films State Street TreeNote Utah News Now More KUER Podcasts RadioWest RadioWest Films State Street TreeNote Utah News Now More KUER Podcasts How To Listen Mobile App Frequencies Smart Speakers Audio Streaming Help Report A Signal Outage Mobile App Frequencies Smart Speakers Audio Streaming Help Report A Signal Outage Connect About Staff Contact Social Media Feedback Form About Staff Contact Social Media Feedback Form Support Ways To Give Sponsorship Major Giving Planned Giving Vehicle Donation Foundations myKUER Ways To Give Sponsorship Major Giving Planned Giving Vehicle Donation Foundations myKUER Events Community Calendar Submit A PSA/Event KUER Events Community Calendar Submit A PSA/Event KUER Events Newsletters KUER Morning Brief RadioWest State Street KUER Morning Brief RadioWest State Street Science & Environment Deadly bird flu reappears in US commercial poultry flocks in Utah and South Dakota KUER 90.1 | By Associated Press Published October 10, 2023 at 3:56 PM MDT Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email Charlie Neibergall / APA turkey stands in a barn, Aug. 10, 2015, on a turkey farm near Manson, Iowa. The U.S. Department of Agriculture reported that avian influenza (bird flu), which is deadly to commercial poultry, was confirmed in a flock of 47,300 turkeys in Jerauld County of South Dakota last Wednesday, Oct. 4, 2023, and at a farm with 141,800 birds in Sanpete County of Utah last Friday, Oct. 6. Highly pathogenic bird flu has made its first appearances in U.S. commercial poultry flocks this season, affecting one turkey farm in South Dakota and one in Utah and raising concerns that more outbreaks could follow.The U.S. Department of Agriculture reported that avian influenza, which is deadly to commercial poultry, was confirmed in a flock of 47,300 turkeys in Jerauld County, South Dakota, on Oct. 4 and at a farm with 141,800 birds in Utah's Sanpete County last Friday.The outbreaks are the first reported among commercial flocks in the U.S. since the disease struck two turkey farms in the Dakotas in April. Infected flocks are normally destroyed to prevent the flu's spread, and then the farms are decontaminated.Before last week, the only reports of bird flu in recent months in the U.S. in recent months were sporadic appearances in backyard flocks or among wild birds such as ducks, geese and eagles. While wild birds often show no symptoms of avian influenza, infections in them are a concern to the poultry industry because migrating birds can spread the disease to vulnerable commercial flocks.“I don’t doubt that we will have more cases," South Dakota State Veterinarian Beth Thompson said in an interview Tuesday. “I would be very pleasantly surprised if we're done because migration is just starting.”Bird flu last year cost U.S. poultry producers nearly 59 million birds across 47 states, including egg-laying chickens and turkeys and chickens raised for meat, making it the country's deadliest outbreak ever, according to USDA figures. The outbreak caused spikes in egg and turkey prices for consumers and cost the government over $660 million.The toll from a 2015 outbreak, deemed the most expensive animal health disaster in U.S. history with over $1 billion in costs to the government, was nearly 51 million birds in 15 states.Bird flu infections in humans are relatively rare and aren’t considered a food safety risk. But as it hits other species, including some mammals, scientists fear the virus could evolve to spread more easily among people. Cambodia this week reported its third human death from bird flu this year.Agriculture officials consider this year's cases to be part of last year's outbreak, which reached the U.S. in February 2022 after spreading in Europe. The U.S. has imposed periodic restrictions on poultry imports from Europe to limit the potential for spread. Thompson said the virus never completely went away, unlike in 2015, and that the version now circulating is essentially the same that spread last year.“Were just encouraging bird owners to make sure they're increasing their biosecurity practices because avian flu is still out there and it's easy to contract," said Bailee Woolstenhulme, spokesperson for the Utah Department of Agriculture and Food.However, producers have kept their biosecurity tight for several years, and there is little more that farmers can do beyond the steps they have already taken to try to keep the virus out of their flocks. The main strategy is to prevent droppings of wild birds from being tracked into poultry barns on workers' footwear and clothing, or from hitchhiking on farm equipment, mice, small birds and even dust particles.This was Utah’s first case this year, Woolstenhulme said, but 16 turkey farms, one egg farm and several backyard flocks were affected in the state last year.South Dakota producers lost nearly 4 million birds last year. Iowa, the hardest-hit state, with nearly 16 million birds lost, hasn't recorded a case since March.

The researchers were able to restrict, but not completely block, the avian influenza virus from infecting the birds by precisely altering a small section of their DNA. According to the study published in the journal Nature Communications, the modified birds showed no signs of any impact on the animals' health or well-being. While the findings are encouraging, further gene edits would be needed to produce chickens which cannot be infected by bird flu, the researchers said. "Although we haven't yet got the perfect combination of gene edits to take this approach into the field, the results have told us a lot about how influenza virus functions inside the infected cell and how to slow its replication," said Professor Wendy Barclay, from Imperial College London. Bird flu is a major global threat with a devastating impact in both farmed and wild bird populations. The team bred chickens with small edits to a gene called ANP32A. During an infection, influenza viruses hijack the ANP32A protein to help replicate themselves. However, when the gene-edited birds were exposed to a normal dose of virus -- the H9N2 strain of avian influenza -- 9 out of 10 birds remained uninfected and there was no spread to other chickens. When the birds were exposed to an artificially high dose of virus, only half of them became infected. The single gene edit also provided some protection against transmission, with a much lower amount of virus in infected gene-edited birds compared to non-edited birds, the researchers said. The technique also helped to limit onward spread of the virus to just one of four non-edited chickens placed in the same incubator. There was no transmission to gene-edited birds, they said. The analysis showed that in the edited birds, the virus adapted to engage the support of two related proteins to replicate - ANP32B and ANP32E. The researchers stress that additional genetic changes would be needed for the virus to have the potential to infect and spread effectively in humans. According to the team, the findings demonstrate that a single gene edit is not robust enough to produce resistant chickens. To prevent the emergence of viruses able to adapt to the single edit, the team next used a triple edit to target additional proteins (ANP32A, ANP32B and ANP32E) in lab-grown chicken cells. In cell cultures in the lab, growth of the virus was successfully blocked in cells with edits to all three genes. In future, researchers hope to develop chickens with this triple edit, but no birds have been produced at this stage. The study highlights the importance of responsible gene editing and the need to be alert to the risks of driving viral evolution in unwanted directions if complete resistance is not achieved, they said. "Bird flu is a great threat to bird populations. Vaccination against the virus poses a number of challenges, with significant practical and cost issues associated with vaccine deployment," said Professor Mike McGrew, from the University of Edinburgh, and principal investigator of the study. "Gene-editing offers a promising route towards permanent disease resistance, which could be passed down through generations, protecting poultry and reducing the risks to humans and wild birds," McGrew added.Read More News onbird fluUK researchersgenetically editing chickenschickensDNA(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

The vaccine, which uses genetic material known as messenger RNA (mRNA), is expected to be more effective in preventing mass infection should cases for both diseases spike at once, reducing burden on medical staff. A COVID-19 and flu combination vaccine provides protection in a single shot against the two infectious diseases, which both spread widely in winter. In September, Daiichi Sankyo applied to the Health, Labor and Welfare Ministry for approval to manufacture and sell an mRNA vaccine targeting the novel coronavirus’ omicron XBB 1.5 variant. Daiichi Sankyo’s development of a new combination vaccine using mRNA will be financially supported by the Strategic Center for Biomedical Advanced Vaccine Research and Development for Preparedness and Response, the government’s command center for vaccine development. U.S. pharmaceutical companies Moderna Inc. and Pfizer Inc. lead the field in mRNA-based combination vaccines. Moderna announced on Oct. 4 that it had confirmed the safety and efficacy of this type of vaccine in initial clinical trials. The company will begin final stage trials as early as the end of this year, aiming for approval in 2025. Add TheJapanNews to your Google News feed. Coronavirus Latest Articles ¥468.5 Bil.

If you’ve never had a flu shot before, or are just in need of a refresher, you’re probably looking for some insight on what to expect afterward. ICYDK, flu viruses typically spread in early fall and winter, peaking between December and February, according to the FDA. But because the virus mutates, every flu season is different, meaning the health impact varies widely from year to year. As a result, the flu vaccine is updated every year to protect against new flu virus strains that are expected to circulate and cause illnesses. That means you do, in fact, need a flu shot every year. Still, it’s totally understandable to have concerns about the shot’s potential side effects. But the first thing to note is that the vaccine reduces the risk of life-threatening disease somewhere in the range of 40 to 60 percent, and as high as 75 percent among children, per the CDC.There’s also the long-running myth that getting your flu shot will give you the flu. However, it is not possible to contract influenza from the vaccine, says Michael Hanak, MD, the associate chief medical officer for Population Health. “The vaccine is made from inactivated viral particles, which do not cause illness."While it won’t give you the virus, many people experience mild flu-like symptoms after vaccination, which is a sign that your body is producing antibodies and generating an immune response. And that's a good thing!Meet the experts: Michael Hanak, MD, is a board-certified family physician and associate professor in the department of family & preventive medicine at Rush Medical College. Sindhu Aderson, MD, is the medical director of Northwestern Medicine Immediate Care. Amesh A. Adalja, MD, is an infectious disease physician and a senior scholar at Johns Hopkins University for Health Security. Soma Mandal, MD, is an internist at Summit Medical Group in Berkeley Heights, New Jersey.It's more important than ever to get vaccinated this year.Influenza is responsible for thousands of hospitalizations and hundreds of deaths each year, and while the flu vaccine does not protect 100 percent of people from actually contracting the flu, much like the COVID vaccine, it can prevent severe illness.And side effects are transient and typically last one to two days after vaccination, says Sindhu Aderson, MD, the medical director of Northwestern Medicine Immediate Care. People who are vaccinated and get sick anyway tend to experience less severe symptoms as well as decrease their risk of hospitalization. “This is why the flu shot is an incredibly important tool to keep ourselves and those around us safe,” says Dr. Aderson.If you are thinking of getting a flu shot this year, plan accordingly. The vaccine can take 14 days to take full effect, according to Dr. Hanak, so take into account any holiday plans or upcoming travel.The vaccine is not effective immediately, so people who were exposed to influenza or another virus shortly before or after getting their shot may still get sick, completely unrelated to their vaccination.Another thing to note? Talk of the flu shot’s many side effects tend to be exaggerated. We repeat: The flu shot can’t actually give you the flu, and while there are some possible side effects, most are rare, says infectious disease expert Amesh A. Adalja, MD, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.If you’re particularly wary of needles, you may prefer the nasal influenza spray (Flumist) over an injection, says Soma Mandal, MD, an internist at Summit Medical Group in Berkeley Heights, New Jersey. “Not everyone should get the nasal flu spray due to factors like age and underlying health conditions, though, so talk to your doctor to determine if it’s the best option for you,” she adds.The flu shot is still worth it despite potential side effects.Here are the flu shot side effects to be aware of this season, from common soreness and redness to rare effects like Guillain-Barre syndrome. After you've read through them, roll up your sleeve because flu season is coming. And the vaccine is still your best stay-healthy defense. 1. Shoulder SorenessIf you receive the flu shot as an intramuscular injection (a.k.a. in your arm, typically), odds are you may end up with some muscle soreness in your upper armThat’s because the needle is injected directly into the muscle, causing microscopic damage to the cells, and is designed to cause an inflammatory immune system response. If the pain is very noticeable or decreases your mobility, Dr. Adalja recommends checking with your doctor.What to do: If you are experiencing shoulder soreness, especially at the injection site, you can opt for an over-the-counter medication such as acetaminophen (Tylenol).2. Redness Or SwellingAnytime you pierce the skin and put something into the body, it can cause a topical reaction, says Dr. Adalja. This is just a sign that your immune system is activating. But this redness and swelling where you get your shot is a common side effect that only typically lasts a few days. It’ll go away on its own, but if it’s really bugging you, you can take acetaminophen. What to do: Try avoiding activities involving the shoulder immediately after your shot, and to take [medication] as needed, says Dr. Hanak. You may even want to schedule your flu vaccine before a weekend or a day off from the gym to avoid having to use your arm, which may be sore post-vaccination.3. Body AchesAny vaccine can cause body aches because of the way in which they activate the immune system, says Dr. Adalja. Related StoryShould Pregnant People Get The Flu Shot?If you’re feeling sore in places other than your arm, it's usually nothing to worry about, though Dr. Adalja notes that the flu shot does take two weeks to become fully effective—so your body aches could be a sign of the flu, since viral strains are probably circulating around the time you get the vaccine.What to do: Hydrating with plenty of water and taking acetaminophen is your best bet at relieving body aches. 4. An Allergic ReactionWhile it’s extremely rare, it is possible to have an allergic reaction to the flu shot. Any medication or vaccination has the potential for adverse effects including severe life-threatening reactions, says Dr. Mandal. In some cases, this can look like itching at the injection site, a full-body rash, or signs of anaphylactic shock, which would require immediate medical attention. In more severe cases, you may experience hives, wheezing, shortness of breath, fast heart rate and dizziness within a few hours of receiving the vaccine. Related StoryHow Long Does a Virus Last?“There are lots of myths about egg allergies and the vaccine," explains Dr. Adalja—because most flu shots and nasal sprays are manufactured using technology that involves small amounts of egg proteins, per the CDC. But in reality, you can likely get the shot even if you’re allergic to eggs, the CDC says.BTW, if you’ve had an allergic reaction to the flu shot in the past, you are among those few groups of people who the CDC recommends skip the flu shot.What to do: For a local reaction, Dr. Hanak recommends taking an allergy medication like Benadryl or using any anti-itch creams or lotions like a topical Benadryl cream to help with the discomfort. In severe situations, take allergy medication if it’s immediately available, and call 911 to go to the hospital. In some instances, you may need steroids or other treatments to help quell these flu shot side effects if they are severe. 5. FeverYou probably won’t get a fever because of the vaccine, but if you do, it should be low-grade (i.e. less than 101 degrees). If it’s higher than that, don’t blame your flu shot—you probably have an unrelated illness. “Remember that you’re getting the vaccine at the height of respiratory virus season,” says Dr. Adalja. “So you may have been incubating another virus [without knowing it].”And once again (for the people in the back!): The flu shot cannot give you the flu. While some flu vaccines contain virus strains, they're not live strains, so they can’t get you sick. Meanwhile some flu shots only contain a specific protein from the influenza virus, per the CDC.What to do: Drink cold fluids, stay hydrated, and take acetaminophen until the fever subsides, says Dr. Hanak.6. Dizziness Or FaintingThis is less a side effect of the vaccine itself and more a side effect of a needle phobia, says Dr. Adalja. If you think you might have a stress reaction or faint, give your health care provider a heads up so they can make sure you stay seated after the shot to prevent injury.What to do: Dr. Hanak advises monitoring your blood pressure and reporting to your doctor. You should also do your best to stay hydrated.7. HeadacheAn aching head is included in the CDC’s official list of potential side effects, but it’s nothing to panic over. “It is just part of the immune reaction to the vaccine,” says Dr. Adalja, adding that it usually goes away pretty quickly and can “easily” be treated with acetaminophen. FWIW: Some of the headaches could just be due to anxiety about getting a shot, Dr. Piedra says. “People could receive a placebo shot and get headaches as well,” he says.What to do: Drink plenty of fluids and take some acetaminophen until your headache subsides.8. NauseaThis is another one listed by the CDC that Dr. Piedra says is likely due to anxiety. “There are people that, when they get an injection of whatever type, can have some gastrointestinal manifestations afterward, including nausea,” he says. “It’s often attributed to anxiety.” It’s possible to have a little nausea as a larger part of your body’s response to the flu vaccine, Dr. Adalja says, but it doesn’t last long. “It will flee rapidly,” adds Dr. Piedra.What to do: Consider OTC options like Dramamine, ginger supplements, or Pepto-Bismo to tame your stomach. You may want to make some dietary changes depending on what types of beverages and foods your stomach can handle.9. Guillain-Barre Syndrome Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) is an auto-immune disorder that’s triggered by a wide variety of things, from vaccines to viral infections.GBS causes damage to the nervous system, resulting in symptoms like muscle weakness, numbness, difficulty walking or an odd gait, and even paralysis, says Dr. Adalja. While most people fully recover from the disorder, the recovery period can range from six months to three years, according to Mayo Clinic.Related Story'My Fever Turned Out To Be A Bladder Infection'The connection between GBS and the flu vaccine has also been overhyped. “People should remember that influenza itself is much more likely to cause GBS than the vaccine,” adds Dr. Adalja.And since no more than one or two cases per million people vaccinated will have this side effect, it’s better to take your (super small) chances with GBS than with one of the many common, severe complications that often come with the flu itself. Studies have shown that the likelihood of contracting GBS is actually higher after having influenza than after receiving the influenza vaccine, notes Dr. Hanak. “On average we see one to two cases per million vaccinations, but the evidence is not clear yet as to how strong a link exists.” For example, 13 million older adults showed no increase in GBS following flu vaccination, a recent study published in JAMA reported.What to do: If you experience any of the symptoms of GBS, it's best to check in with your doctor about next steps. 10. FatigueAnother flu shot side effect is fatigue and a runny nose, notes Dr. Hanak. Just like other symptoms that stem from the body’s immune response these are “usually short-lived,” he says.What to do: If the side effects are bothersome, drink plenty of fluids, rest, and use nasal decongestants for nasal symptoms.Why do some people get side effects and others don’t? It is estimated that up to 20 percent of people with influenza do not exhibit symptoms, which further shows everyone needs to get vaccinated, explains Dr. Hanak. “Similarly, varying levels of immune response occur with the flu vaccine, which can produce a wide variety of symptoms, including none at all,” he says.Many factors can play a role, including age, medications taken regularly, other health conditions, and timing (i.e., receiving the shot when you have seasonal allergies or other ongoing illnesses).The flu vaccine is designed to stimulate your immune system to build antibodies against the virus, and the thought here is that those people having side effects from the flu shot are those whose bodies are having a robust response to the vaccine, says Dr. Aderson. That said, not experiencing flu shot side effects does not mean that the vaccine didn’t work.As with many things in life, everybody and every body will respond differently to the flu shot depending on many different factors.

Swapnil MishraUpdated: Wednesday, October 11, 2023, 10:42 PM IST Representative Image Experts across the city have warned a surge in influenza A H3N2 cases during winter as there have been 2.8 times rise in cases reported in the last four months (June to September), while there was also 20 per cent drop in swine flu or H1N1 during the same period. However, the surge have been to the change in weather condition and intermittent rainfall was favourable conditions for influenza virus to spread.

We have seen rise in all kind of diseases and viruses includes dengue, influenza A H3N2, conjunctivitis, Malaria and others. The influenza strain has been dominating due to which cases have tripled in just four months and it is expected to increase more during winters,” said a senior health official from the state health department.H3N2 Spreading Faster Among People with Low ImmunityHowever the infection of H1N1 (swine flu) and H3N2 which comes under influenza-A, continues to persist among the people of Maharashtra including Mumbai. The data clearly a shows influenza A strain H3N2 has been spreading rapidly among the people with low immunity compared to H1N1. Dr Pratit Samdani, Internal Medicine Specialist, Breach Candy Hospital, said there is a possibility of cases might start to increase post monsoon as winter is also nearing when upper respiratory tract infections are more at that time. “I believe that whenever there is a drop in temperature, cases of influenza increase. This year there was intermittent rain and temperature kept fluctuating from high to low due to which cases were increased. However most of the cases were detected at a time of testing but in reality the numbers are more,” he said. High Positivity Rate in H3N2 Tests, Slow Recovery for PatientsDr Gautam Bhansali, physician of Bombay Hospital, said that cases of upper respiratory tract infection are still being reported. Out of all the H3N2 tests conducted so far, 60 percent have been found positive. This is a viral disease and most of them do not get themselves tested. “Most of the patients had low immunity which was favourable for influenza strain to attack them. Moreover it is like a viral disease or fever which spreads faster, but patients are also taking atleast two to three weeks to get recovered,” he said.

Next Local News Flu vaccine rollout in Weyburn Written by Steven Wilson Thursday, Oct 12 2023, 12:12 PM Share: Copied! File photo Article continues below advertisement ↴ With October here, the start of flu season has arrived as well. To help counter that, flu vaccines are now being made available throughout Saskatchewan, including here in Weyburn. “The influenza vaccine, as we know, is safe and effective, and it’s a way to help us stay healthy and prevent serious illness,” said Dr. Stanley Enebeli. He is the medical health officer for the Weyburn area with the Saskatchewan Health Authority. “All Saskatchewan residents, aged six months and older, are eligible to get a free influenza vaccine shot every year.” The SHA identifies the groups at the highest risk of developing complications due to influenza as those with underlying health concerns, a compromised immune system, children under the age of five, and pregnant women. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of cases of influenza went down throughout Saskatchewan. Last flu season, though, the numbers began to come back. “Basically, what we’re seeing is that the 2022-2023 influenza season, the last one, saw us return to the pre-pandemic-like influenza trends in Canada, so we expect that this season will be similar as well,” Enebeli added. This year, there is also a high-dose vaccine available for those who are 65 years of age and older. The high-dose vaccine has a higher dose of the viral antigens than the standard vaccine. Enebeli said this is better for protecting seniors as it produces a higher antibody response. The vaccine is currently available at a number of pharmacies in Weyburn, as well as at walk-in clinics being held in the area. Residents can also book an appointment to get their flu vaccine.
