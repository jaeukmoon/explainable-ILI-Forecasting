Since then, we have worked swiftly to identify and respond to detections and mitigate the virus’ impact on U.S. poultry production and trade. Detections are higher in the fall and spring, because we continue to see wild birds spreading virus as they migrate to their seasonal homes. APHIS continues to work closely with State animal health officials on surveillance efforts to look for the virus in commercial, backyard, and wild birds. We also continue to encourage all bird owners to practice strong biosecurity—that means reducing opportunities for wildlife to spread the virus to their birds and preventing the spread of the virus from one premises to another.To provide context on the overall size of the U.S. poultry flock, there are more than 378.5 million egg-laying chickens in the United States. In 2023, more than 9.4 billion broiler chickens and 218 million turkeys were processed in the United States (data from USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service). Confirmed HPAI DetectionsThe dashboard below is designed to provide a current snapshot of confirmed HPAI detections in the United States. While it also includes summary data compiled since the outbreak began, looking at cases confirmed over the last 30 days provides the best picture of how the virus is currently impacting U.S. birds. We expect the number of cases to ebb and flow as the levels of virus continues to change in different areas based on wild bird movement.

Mullinax3 Show authors Scientific Reports volume 14, Article number: 14199 (2024) Cite this article 2064 Accesses 4 Altmetric Metrics details Subjects AgroecologyEcological epidemiologyInfluenza virus AbstractThe wild to domestic bird interface is an important nexus for emergence and transmission of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses. Although the recent incursion of HPAI H5N1 Clade 2.3.4.4b into North America calls for emergency response and planning given the unprecedented scale, readily available data-driven models are lacking. Here, we provide high resolution spatial and temporal transmission risk models for the contiguous United States. Considering virus host ecology, we included weekly species-level wild waterfowl (Anatidae) abundance and endemic low pathogenic avian influenza virus prevalence metrics in combination with number of poultry farms per commodity type and relative biosecurity risks at two spatial scales: 3 km and county-level. Spillover risk varied across the annual cycle of waterfowl migration and some locations exhibited persistent risk throughout the year given higher poultry production. Validation using wild bird introduction events identified by phylogenetic analysis from 2022 to 2023 HPAI poultry outbreaks indicate strong model performance. The modular nature of our approach lends itself to building upon updated datasets under evolving conditions, testing hypothetical scenarios, or customizing results with proprietary data. This research demonstrates an adaptive approach for developing models to inform preparedness and response as novel outbreaks occur, viruses evolve, and additional data become available.

Although some strains of H5 and H7 LPAI possess the potential to rapidly become highly pathogenic (HPAI) during replication in gallinaceous poultry where there is high density, such occurrences typically present limited threat to wild bird hosts. However, the emergence of a specific lineage of H5 HPAI in the late 1990s led to an alteration of this paradigm, as this lineage (A/goose/Guangdong/1996-like [gsGD]) spilled over and subsequently was maintained in wild bird populations2. Following its emergence, gsGD H5 quickly spread through Asia, and once established in migratory wild bird populations, has led to several intercontinental events, causing notable losses to wild birds, agriculture, and even impacting human health. In the ensuing decades, gsGD H5 has become endemic in several countries in Africa, Asia, and along migratory routes in Europe3.The gsGD H5 lineage presents an ongoing and continuously evolving threat to domestic poultry and wild birds at an intercontinental scale4,5. For instance, the incursion of gsGD H5N1 into North America in late 2021 has caused wild bird mortality events across the continental United States6, including over 40 large scale events (> 100 dead wild birds within an event;7). Furthermore, more than 60 million domestic poultry have died directly from infection or related control efforts through the course of this outbreak8. While there remains some uncertainty whether endemicity will occur within North America wild waterfowl9, the ongoing circulation of both gsGD H5 along with typical North American LPAI strains among wild birds signals ongoing risk of AIV transmission across the wild waterfowl—domestic poultry interface.Due to the large economic impacts related to AIV outbreaks, there have been efforts to identify areas of transmission risk at the wild waterfowl—domestic poultry interface. Many of these efforts focus on farm-to-farm transmission10,11,12 or introductions to backyard farms13 without focus on initial introductions from wild birds to domestic poultry flocks. Despite identifying relationships between wild waterfowl abundance and outbreak risk14,15,16, many outbreak prediction efforts either do not include direct representation of wild waterfowl17,18,19 or have relatively static representations of their dynamic temporal distributions20,21,22. This lack of waterfowl inclusion is driven by limited availability of data on wild bird distributions and abundances23. While this issue persists for certain regions of the globe, the emergence of species-specific waterfowl abundance estimates at high spatial and temporal resolution for the entire continental United States24,25 presents an opportunity to advance AIV transmission risk models for this region.The objective of this work is the formation of a flexible model to estimate the risk of AIV transmission, which includes both highly and low pathogenic strains, from wild waterfowl to domestic poultry across the contiguous United States at a fine spatial and temporal resolution that can be easily adapted as new information is generated or under novel scenarios. Here, we sought to incorporate species-specific estimates of waterfowl abundance and AIV prevalence in a spatial and temporal context with domestic poultry distributions and relative risks dependent on production and poultry type. As data availability currently restricts the AIV prevalence models to endemically circulating viruses, development of these models is a first step towards providing adaptive tools to support decision makers in preparing for and responding to outbreak scenarios. Validating these models using phylogenetic analyses of poultry virus isolates to identify wild bird spillover events into farms from the current gsGD H5 clade 2.3.4.4b outbreak will assess the model’s ability to predict spillover locations for these novel incursions despite the initial use of currently available endemic virus prevalence models. We stress that these models, while designed to estimate the risk of endemic LPAI transmission into domestic poultry operations, can be readily altered for potential novel scenarios (Fig. 1).Figure 1Graphical depiction of model components. The model seeks to quantify the risk of endemic avian influenza viruses spilling over from wild waterfowl reservoirs into domestic poultry operations. This risk can be measured as the product of the risk component associated with wild waterfowl and the risk component associated with poultry operations. For waterfowl, this component equals the relative abundance of infected waterfowl at a given time and place, which can be calculated as the relative abundance of waterfowl (Wa) multiplied by the proportion that are infected with AIV (Wp) for each species (s). For the poultry side of the equation, this risk component can be broken down into the number of poultry facilities (Pn) multiplied by the risk (Pr) of each type of poultry facility (t). The modular nature of this model allows for adaptive management as new data are collected and compiled, such as the inclusion of a wider variety of avian and non-avian wild hosts, hypothetical models of prevalence in the event of a novel incursion event, more detailed or proprietary locations of poultry facilities, and the inclusion of additional biosecurity information.Full size imageResultsOverall resultsResults for 4 model sets are provided as both fine-scale (3 km2 resolution) rasters, as well as summed to the county level for each week of the year (See Data Availability): (1) the primary model set using endemically circulating LPAI prevalence spatiotemporal model inputs, (2) models for H5 subtypes, (3) models for H7 subtypes, and (4) the primary model set that includes an environmental transmission component. Rasters for the model components are also available in the data release26. Figure 2 shows results for the primary model set, highlighting some of the larger, broad-scale seasonal differences. In general, we see the predicted risk of spillover events (of either highly or low pathogenic strains) shifting north and south with waterfowl migration, and the overall level of risk rising and falling with avian influenza prevalence, reaching its lowest levels in late spring and early summer. Additionally, we see some areas of particularly high poultry production that remain at an elevated risk year-round (i.e., risk at certain locations remains comparatively higher throughout the year than in surrounding areas, though relative risk does still increase and decrease throughout the year). Relative risk for the two subtype models showed stronger variation throughout the year, although with similar spatial patterns. Namely, the H5 model shows a more dramatic increase in risk during the late fall (Fig. 3), while the H7 model shows an increase primarily during spring (Fig. 4), consistent with when these two subtypes are most prevalent.Figure 2(A) Examples of weekly relative avian influenza transmission risk maps at the wild waterfowl and domestic poultry interface (3 km spatial and weekly temporal resolutions shown here; county level spatial resolution models were also run and are provided in released model outputs26).

(B) The temporal distribution of these introduction events, estimated to be two weeks prior to the confirmation of each positive flock, as identified by the WOAH59 14-day incubation period preceding outbreak events.Full size imageThe version of the model that sought to include environmental persistence produced results that were highly similar to those of the primary model even with wide-ranging values that were included in the sensitivity analysis (bootstrapped Pearson’s correlation, r = 1.00, 0.97, 0.68 corresponding to a national and annual average proportion of 2.2 × 10−62 of viruses surviving after 100 days based on prevailing literature, and values of 6.8 × 10−7, and 0.24 of viruses surviving after 100 days due to uncertainty in this metric (see Appendix S1 for methods). Given similar results of the two versions of the model and the need for significant additional data on the amount of virus that can survive in the environment under different conditions and durations of time, we chose to present the more parsimonious version in the main text and place the adapted model in Supplemental Appendix S1.ValidationThe model performed quite well at predicting spillover events during the 2022–2023 HPAI outbreak at the county level (Fig. 4), even though it was not designed to predict spillover events for this novel incursion. Both the AUC and Spearman’s correlation validation methods performed well (Table 1), and outbreaks overwhelmingly occurred in counties with greater than average risk (Fig. 5). This was not true of the fine-scale model where many of the grid cells that actually did experience spillover events were incorrectly assigned no risk by the model because they did not contain poultry operations via the poultry hybrid model. As a reminder, this poultry model simulates locations of likely poultry locations, particularly for the backyard flocks.Table 1 Model validation metrics, area under the receiver operator curve (AUC) and Spearman’s correlation coefficient (Rho) for (A) the full model (county-level spatial scale). In addition to the full model on all poultry farms, the model and validation steps were also run with only (B) commercial poultry operations, for which we have more confidence in the actual locations, and (C) backyard poultry operations for which we have less confidence in spatial locations.Full size tableFigure 5Comparison of the relative risk of counties that experienced spillover events to all counties. Grey bars show the distribution of relative risk scores, log-base 10 transformed, for all counties, while red lines show the relative risk for counties that experienced spillover events. Most spillover counties had risk scores greater than the average of all counties and very few had below-average risk.Full size imageCertain components of the model were more informative than others (Table 1). Specifically, a model containing only the effect of waterfowl abundance would have performed nearly as well as the full model. Adding the prevalence component did not appear to have improved the model’s predictive ability. The majority of spillover events occurred in spring (late March through mid-May) when species and counties were predicted to have similar, low levels of AIV infections27, presenting little variation in this variable for the model to use. If more spillover events had occurred during mid to late autumn when there are large differences in AIV prevalence among waterfowl, the prevalence component may have had a larger effect on driving model results. Moreover, the gsGD H5 virus is antigenically distinct from other H5 viruses and affects a wide range of species, especially compared to typical endemic viruses which often favor specific species groups and circulate along predictable migratory routes. However, virus prevalence may still be useful in predicting the spillover of the LPAI viruses. Examination of model components also showed that the relative risk and number of different types of poultry operations contributed less predictive power compared to waterfowl abundance (Table 1). However, in additional model and validation runs where we explored using only commercial or backyard poultry operations, we found that the poultry inputs were more informative using the commercial poultry inputs, where point locations are better identified at the higher spatial resolutions (3 km vs county level).Lastly, we compared these results to those expected by the model based on simulated outbreak events. The simulations showed similar patterns to the validation data (Fig. 6). However, the simulations tended to place more spillover events into higher-risk categories and fewer spillover events into counties with lower-risk categories than we observed in the actual data. This indicates that the model was likely overconfident in its predictions, particularly at the highest risk quantiles.Figure 6Comparison of model expectations (red bars) to the number of counties that experienced wild bird spillover events in the ongoing highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 Clade 2.3.4.4b outbreaks in the United States. Grey bars show the number of counties that experienced a spillover event in each weekly risk quantile. Red points show the average number (± 95% CI) predicted from the model based on simulations. The model performs well for most of the distribution but overestimates transmission risk for the highest quantile risk category.Full size imageDiscussionIn this study we generated predictions of AIV spillover from wild birds to domestic poultry operations at weekly intervals for the contiguous United States, elucidating patterns in the spatio-temporal distribution of transmission risk at the wild-domestic interface. The estimated risk at a given grid cell and time step was primarily driven by waterfowl abundance. Specifically, we observed increases in predicted risk in the spring as waterfowl began the northward migration, followed by declines through the summer breeding period when bird movements are reduced, and a resurgence during fall migration. These trends were further amplified by AIV prevalence, which generally follows the same seasonal patterns27 driven primarily by availability of naïve juveniles28,29, with contributions from factors such as environmental persistence along migratory routes and wintering sites30. Though important, these patterns were not surprising given that previous efforts have indicated the importance of waterfowl abundance to the transmission of AIV across this interface15,16.While the seasonal trends in transmission risk driven by waterfowl abundance and AIV prevalence appear reasonable for the endemic LPAI viruses on which this model was built, we might not expect such patterns during a novel incursion such as the current gsGD H5 outbreak in North America. During a novel incursion, waterfowl will lack homosubtypic immunities that would help mediate viral spread among adults31, allowing rapid spread even during periods that would otherwise have low prevalence32. This dynamic is well illustrated by the large number of HPAI detections and mortality events in wild birds observed during the summer of 2022 following the initial introduction into the United States in January 20226. Similarly, while endemic LPAI’s do move longitudinally between flyways, spread is predominately latitudinal within a flyway and linked to annual migratory cycles33,34. However, during the current gsGD H5 outbreak we have observed an east to west spread based around the initial introduction location in the Atlantic flyway35,36. Due to the differing dynamics between endemic viruses and novel incursions, we constrained our validation to only make comparisons spatially within weeks and not between weeks. This same limitation should be considered when comparing predicted risk hotspots across time, as the relative risk between locations within weeks is more informative than the absolute values at a location across time based on the nature of the novel incursion.Given the strong influence of waterfowl distribution and AIV prevalence on transmission risk across the landscape (Table 1), the impact of domestic poultry distribution appears subdued in comparison (Table 1). This reduced role in the pattern of risk is likely due to the static nature of farm locations which present a spatially consistent interface. Additionally, at first glance, poultry distribution appears to have little variation across the landscape, however, when poultry are broken down by production category (commercial vs. backyard) and commodity type (broiler, turkey, etc.) notable trends emerge. Commercial broiler production appears clustered, with hotspots in regions such as the southeast and the Delmarva Peninsula (Delaware, Maryland, Virginia eastern shore). Meanwhile, turkey production is mainly located in the upper Midwest. Due to the concentrations of poultry production facilities, these areas have elevated transmission risk across the year relative to surrounding regions. Conversely, backyard poultry operations are scattered much more randomly and evenly around the landscape, likely reducing centralization of risk.An important limitation of the high spatial resolution model sets (3 km2) comes from the application of the hybrid poultry model inputs37 which are the most recent spatially explicit, high-resolution predictions of poultry operation locations available for the United States. This model provides likely coordinates of poultry farm locations by farm type (broiler, layer, pullet, or turkey; commercial or backyard; and breeding or production) based on environmental covariates, artificial intelligence to identify commercial facilities, and constraints by the number and size of operations reported in the USDA-NASS CoA. The model provides predicted locations, not actual locations, particularly for the smaller farm types (non-commercial and backyard flocks) or those that are located in counties that did not receive the artificial intelligence and satellite imagery application. Hence, at the 3 km scale for our risk models, the poultry layer might show farm locations where they are likely to be, but in reality, are located somewhere in the general vicinity within or just beyond 3 km. When validating with spillover events that are derived from virus isolates collected from actual farm locations, this spatial incongruity shows weaker model performance. However, when collated at a slightly coarser scale, such as the county level, the model performs quite well. Nearly all outbreaks occurred in counties that were identified as being above average risk (Fig. 5), and the AUC and Spearman's correlations show strong predictive power at this spatial scale (Table 1). Still, the model does appear overconfident in counties it deems to be of the highest risk quantile (25th weekly risk quantile, Fig. 6). This overconfidence could be explained by three primary scenarios. First, our model assumes inputs have a linear impact on the effect of risk—such that a doubling of any variable doubles the risk. However, in practice, it is likely that at very large values, a level of risk saturation is reached. Framed another way, if a large number of waterfowl are already present, additional waterfowl likely add negligible additional risk. The second possible explanation for model overconfidence is that the model could simply be overfit due to poultry location data being modeled as exact locations without error. A possible future improvement to the model could be to add error estimates to the poultry model inputs so they could be incorporated stochastically into the risk models. Finally, it is possible that farms in counties with the highest poultry production may be more likely to practice enhanced biosecurity due to the elevated perceived risk that may come from having so many additional farms within a close proximity.A second major element of our models that could be improved with additional data is refinement of the relative risk scaler used to represent differential risk between poultry farms based upon the commodity type, sector, and category. Previous work in Europe indicates that backyard farms are at greater risk of an initial introduction event than meat production farms, which are in turn at greater risk than breeder facilities with trends primarily driven by the access of birds in each group to the outdoors38,39. Similarly, challenge studies indicate that turkeys are more susceptible to infection than are chickens40,41,42. While these general trends are well supported (see full description in Supplemental Appendix S2), the selection of relative risk scalers used in this study was a rough approximation of true risk based on studies from different countries due to data availability. Although the virus challenge studies from the literature suggest that these patterns are applicable more broadly than what is reported for the Europe poultry risk studies, this is still a notable limitation of the data within our model. Therefore, further investigation of outbreak patterns within the United States could meaningfully improve input values for this portion of our model and thereby improve model estimates. Additionally, it should be noted that our model does not account for presence or abundance of potential mechanisms for introducing virus shed by waterfowl into the actual poultry facilities, such as bridge species43,44, indirect or fomite transmission, airborne transmission45, etc. These introduction mechanisms were omitted due to insufficient data on the topics.The modular nature of our underlying model and the demonstrated prediction power, including novel solutions, makes it an effective adaptive tool for the management of AIVs. That is, any component of the model can be further refined as more information becomes available or to account for changes on the ground. For instance, the model as presented here focuses on waterfowl, as they are the primary reservoir of viruses that ultimately spill into poultry facilities. However, as more details become available on influenza prevalence, particularly with the continuation of the gsGD H5 clade 2.3.4.4b outbreaks in the United States, additional wild taxa might be added. Likewise, additional data on wild bird distributions are increasingly becoming available for a wider variety of taxa, at finer spatial scales, and with adjustments for global warming. These updated estimates of relative waterfowl abundance can easily replace the current data in this model. Even more importantly, though our model performed well at predicting outbreaks of a novel HPAI incursion, something it was not designed to do, additional modifications could be made in the adaptive management of such novel incursions. For instance, if one were to generate hypothetical prevalence models in wild birds representing a novel incursion, such models could replace the prevalence data in the model presented here to simulate incursion events under different scenarios. On the poultry side of the equation, although some actual poultry population data exist for specific geographic areas or poultry sectors, a national, comprehensive database of U.S. poultry operations is lacking. The hybrid model used here37, and FLAPS46 provide population datasets of farm location and type suitable for modeling in the absence of true farm location data. Any updates to those datasets (e.g. updated USDA-NASS CoA), or datasets collected and made available even at a state or regional level, could be incorporated into the interface models to improve spatial accuracy of poultry farms. However, this could be substituted out for other publicly available data47, or in the event that a poultry producer or contract growing operation wished to analyze their own risk, could be replaced with their own proprietary data of exact farm locations and the biosecurity measures taken at each. Finally, new components could easily be added to this model to extend it in a multitude of ways, as we demonstrate with environmental persistence of the H5 and H7 subtypes.The models presented here provide detailed identification of the spatio-temporal transmission risk of avian influenza from wild waterfowl to domestic poultry for the contiguous United States. Our results highlight that transmission risk is driven primarily by wild waterfowl abundance and AIV prevalence, but that poultry distribution, farm type, and the poultry species being raised are all important considerations. While there are clear areas for improvement to the model inputs as identified above, the strong performance of these models, as validated by the ongoing gsGD H5 outbreak, demonstrates their utility for managers and response coordinators who may seek to use these models to help stage response resources or inform enhanced surveillance approaches. Providing the best science possible in emergency response situations and preferably in anticipation of future emergence of novel pathogens may be key to protecting human, agriculture, and wildlife health. In order to do so, an adaptive approach needs to be taken5, whereby learning from past events and endemically circulating non-pathogenic viral forms, in combination with leveraging early but scarce outbreak data is an important first step in providing tools to managers and decision makers9. Next steps for providing adaptive models for the rapidly evolving gsGD H5 clade 2.3.4.4b situation in North and South America48,49, would be to (a) improve the existing baseline data distribution inputs for host species and farm types, (b) update spatial and temporal inputs reflecting evolving virus patterns across the diverse range of infected taxa, (c) provide risk rankings across poultry types based on data from this region, and (d) extend models across political borders for a cross-continental resource (Canada through South America).Materials and methodsModeling frameworkHere we aim to quantify variation in both the spatial and temporal risk of an avian influenza virus spillover event from wild reservoir species into domestic poultry operations. As such spillover events are generally not reported in the United States for viruses of low-pathogenicity and incursions of highly pathogenic viruses have historically been rare, there is a dearth of data to generate such predictions using conventional regression-type models. As such, our deterministic approach is based on epidemiological theory, following similar past work in other regions23,50.The risk of such a spillover event can be modeled as the relative transmission risk (RR) between wild birds and domestic poultry operations using the following equations:$$RR=W\times P$$ (1) where W is the estimated number of infected waterfowl present at a given time and place and P is the number of poultry operations in that location weighted by their risk of a spillover event occurring. This equation can be further broken down to:$$RR=\sum_{s}\left({Wa}_{s}\times {Wp}_{s}\right)\times \sum_{t}\left({Pn}_{t}\times {Pr}_{t}\right)$$ (2) where Was is the relative abundance of waterfowl of species s, Wps is the percentage of those waterfowl predicted to be positive with AIVs, Pnt is the number of poultry operations of a given type t, and Prt is the relative risk associated with each operation type (See Fig. 1 for graphical depiction of model components). Each of these component variables is described in detail below. In addition to these components, we also developed a set of models that included environmental persistence. However, these models are based on weaker assumptions about the nature of environmental persistence, and as we found little impact of this component on the overall model, even when including sensitivity measures for varying the amount of environmental persistence, these alternative models have been placed in Supplemental Appendix S1.Model componentsOriginal seasonal estimates of waterfowl abundance (Was) were developed for 10 common dabbling duck species in the genus Anas24 using Bayesian joint spatio-temporal hierarchical models and eBird citizen science data 51. More recently, predicted relative abundance models have become available via eBird Status & Trends [https://ebird.org/science/status-and-trends;25] and we switched to these weekly spatial layers as one of our model inputs. In short, these models provide estimated relative abundance of each species (the expected count of individuals detected by an expert birder on a 1 h, 1 km transect at an optimal time of day, which is likely lower than true abundance due to detection issues). While these values may not be exact counts of individuals present, they provide a strong “relative” index by which we can compare waterfowl abundance across the landscape. These predictions are estimated for all 52 weeks of the year at a spatial resolution of 2.96 km2. In total, we included estimates for 30 common waterfowl (Anatidae) species, which included all species for which we have spatial and temporal prevalence estimates (below). Comparing relative abundance among multiple species can be problematic, as these methods do not account for species-specific differences in detection probability. However, this should be mitigated here as most waterfowl species are of roughly comparable size, visibility, and behavior though there are some inherent differences between species.The estimated percentage of waterfowl infected with AIV (Wps), by species, was developed at weekly intervals in a previous model of AIV prevalence in wild waterfowl27. In short, that model combined data from the National Wild Bird Surveillance Program52,53 and the Influenza Research Database54,55 for 30 species of waterfowl. The model was then used to generate spatiotemporal predictions of the proportion of birds that would test positive for AIVs (low pathogenicity) for 30 waterfowl species at weekly intervals for each county in the United States.The number and type of poultry operations (Pnt) comes from the “hybrid poultry model” developed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)37. This model uses a baseline population from the Farm Location and Agricultural Production Simulator (FLAPS) that combines a poultry farm suitability surface with poultry farm numbers and types from the USDA, National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), Census of Agriculture (CoA), to stochastically place likely farm locations and assign them an operation type46. Operation type included the commodity type (broiler, layer, pullet, or turkey), sector (breeding or production), and category (backyard or commercial, numbering 271,289 and 42,019, respectively). In 594 U.S. counties with the greatest poultry production, the hybrid model incorporated remote sensing and artificial intelligence to detect buildings likely to be commercial poultry farms to improve the accuracy of the FLAPS predictions. Though there are likely some changes in poultry production numbers throughout the year (e.g., downtime between flock placement), these are static spatial data and have no temporal component. Since this source data only includes turkey and chicken farms by type, other farm types such as game birds and ducks are not individually represented in this effort.Finally, as there is known variation in the relative risk of different farm types, we developed a relative risk scaler for each poultry operation type. These are described in detail in Supplemental Appendix S2. In short, this includes knowledge on risk by species and poultry type gained from several European studies (where data are available), as well as differences in risk between birds being housed indoors and outdoors. Note that our model does not account for presence or abundance of potential mechanisms for introducing virus shed by waterfowl into the actual poultry facilities due to lack of available data.It has been well documented that different avian influenza virus strains vary with regard to differential risks, even within subtype. Of particular note are the H5 and H7 subtypes (defined by the hemagglutinin surface protein) which have the potential to mutate and become highly pathogenic after spilling over into domestic poultry56. As such, we developed an additional pair of models focused on these two agriculturally important AIV subtypes. For these models, the overall risk was multiplied by the proportion of viruses expected for each subtype based on data from Kent et al.57. This study presented the proportion of influenza positive birds expected to be infected with either the H5 or H7 subtype (both highly and low pathogenic strains) at the county level at monthly intervals for seven waterfowl species. As the taxonomic breadth of the available study was lower than that of our current efforts and because limited species differences were detected, for model input we averaged risks across all species. Additionally, the Kent et al.57 study provided predictions at monthly, instead of weekly intervals, so we interpolated these predictions to place them on the same weekly temporal scale as our models.In summary, four model sets were developed in this study: (a) primary models that are driven by LPAI endemically circulating waterfowl prevalence, (b) models targeted for H5 subtypes, (c) models targeted for H7 subtypes, and (d) the primary model set with environmental persistence components added to the equation. Each model set was conducted at two spatial scales: (a) ~ 2.96 km2 based on the waterfowl inputs (hereafter, 3 km2), and (b) county level which aligns with the waterfowl prevalence models27,57, the USDA hybrid poultry model37 calibrations, and the scale to which USDA targets AIV management and response. While an intermediate scale such as zip code58 was considered, these models were excluded to simplify results given mismatch in scale for poultry predictions and validation data (see below).External validationThese models are designed to estimate the risk of spillover of endemic AIVs, generally of low-pathogenicity, from wild birds into domestic poultry operations, based on the spatio-temporal AIV prevalence model inputs27,57. Data necessary to validate a model such as this require distinction between wild bird farm introductions versus farm-to-farm transmission (lateral spread) or common source events and are generally not available or accessible in most regions of the globe, let alone the United States. However, the 2022 incursion of a gsGD H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b into the United States49,59 provided us with viral sequences from infected premises which were used in phylogenetic analyses to identify wild bird spillover events to validate our model in an HPAI context.In collaboration with USDA, results from phylogenetic analyses that identified evidence for wild bird introduction events into poultry flocks provided censored location-specific inputs for our model validation49. To differentiate between initial wild bird introductions (spillovers) and lateral (farm to farm transmissions) or common source transmission, researchers from the USDA and their partners analyzed samples collected from wild birds and domestic poultry and screened via real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) targeting conserved regions of the matrix gene. Non-negative samples were then confirmed and sequenced by the USDA National Veterinary Services Laboratories. These data, along with other known subtypes from previous outbreak events were then included in a Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) analysis within the Global Initiative for Sharing All Influenza Database (GISAID). All samples were classified by genotype utilizing Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic tree generation or the BLAST based GenoFLU tool49. Bayesian time-scaled phylogenetic analysis produced final differentiation between potential farm-to-farm transmission events versus independent introductions from wild birds. Full details on methodology can be found in Youk et al.49. The final validation dataset represented 294 spillover events from 176 counties. It should be noted that while this dataset provides a confirmation date for infection, we manually set the date of assumed viral introduction as 14 days prior to confirmation to allow for the flock-level incubation period and delay to confirmation60. We acknowledge that various factors such as level of surveillance and strain specific pathogenicity could impact the accuracy of this value but feel that the possible biases introduced would likely have minimal impact on interpretation.This validation dataset is not equivalent to the interface transmission risk model predictions (wild bird spillover introductions into poultry operations using inputs based on endemically circulating AIVs27,57 given availability of data), so some limitations should be noted. First, the patterns of endemically circulating LPAI in reservoir host species may show different seasonal patterns than those from a novel incursion. While past literature shows North American H5 prevalence peaking in the autumn27,28,52, the gsGD virus, which is antigenically distinct from North American H5 viruses, continued to rise throughout the spring and summer. Only a small decrease was noted during the summer months, followed by another peak that arose in the fall 20226,49. As such, we did not validate this model based on changes at a given location or in overall risk across calendar weeks of the year. Instead, we constrained our validation steps to examine patterns within a given weekly interval until spatiotemporal prevalence models for this novel incursion can be developed. The spatial pattern of this incursion began with introduction along the East Coast of North America with subsequent spread south and westward across the continent to the Pacific Coast36,59; however, several virus introductions were characterized from both the Atlantic and Pacific flyways and the virus expansion, and emergence of reassortments has not been strictly linear35,49. Due to its spatial and temporal complexity, we did not attempt to incorporate the gsGD H5 expansion (spread from east to west) in our validation process. This conservative decision should result in low validation estimates, meaning that the predictive power of the model was likely stronger than what is identified by the validation exercise.Model validation took place at two spatial scales. First, we obtained our specific risk estimates for each outbreak location at the fine, 3 km2, resolution of our full model. We then aggregated all data to the county level to understand how well the model performed at this coarser spatial scale which better aligns with larger response and planning efforts61. Inference on model validation was based on two metrics. First, we used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) using the package PresenceAbsence62 to understand the model’s ability to correctly identify counties that experienced a spillover event. This value was based on whether a county experienced a spillover event in a given week and the associated ranked relative risk for that county during that week. We also used a Spearman’s correlation to further validate the model. As the number of counties that did not experience an outbreak on a particular week greatly exceeded the number of counties that did, we elected to use a bootstrapping procedure to better reflect the model’s predictive performance. In short, we randomly sampled with replacement the model’s risk of an outbreak both for the counties that did and did not experience a spillover in a given week so that the number pulled equaled the number of spillover events. For example, there were 15 spillover events detected in week 14 (early April) in the raw data, so each permutation would contain 30 counties (15 that did and 15 that did not experience a spillover event during week 14). These values were then used to calculate a Spearman’s correlation of the ranked relative risk of a spillover event for a given county in a given week and whether or not it experienced an outbreak. This procedure was run for 1,000 iterations and the values were averaged. This series of validations was performed to allow us to assess predictive ability of our model.In addition to running these validation steps for the model’s overall relative risk, we also ran them for individual components of the model to quantify their contribution to its predictive performance. This included the number of infected waterfowl (\(W\)) in Eq. 1, the relative abundance of waterfowl (the sum of \({Wa}_{s}\) in Eq. 2), the number and relative risk of poultry operations (\({Pr}_{t}\) in Eq. 1), and the raw number of poultry operations (the sum of \({Pn}_{t}\) in Eq. 2).Finally, we also wanted to examine how well the model performed compared to its own expectations, which we accomplished using a simulation procedure and qualitative, graphical comparison63. For each week of the year for which we had validation data, we randomly selected counties, with replacement, to experience a “spillover event” equal to the number of spillover events in that week, with the probability of a county being selected proportional to its predicted relative risk. This procedure was run for 1,000 iterations. We then compared the number of outbreaks that occurred in counties of different risk quantiles compared to that in the simulated data. This series of validations was performed to allow us to assess model confidence versus performance (i.e., the expected versus observed distribution of risk values at spillover locations).

Toggle navigation ASPR’s Response to H5N1 Bird Flu New and Notable July 2, 2024: H5N1 mRNA Vaccines Frequently Asked Questions July 2, 2024: HHS Provides $176 Million to Develop Pandemic Influenza mRNA-based Vaccine June 25, 2024: ASPR Releases Pandemic Influenza Preparedness and Response Strategy June 25, 2024: BARDA Pandemic Influenza Preparedness and Response Strategy H5N1 bird flu is widespread in wild birds worldwide and is causing outbreaks in poultry and U.S. dairy cows. While the current public health risk is low, the HHS Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR) is monitoring the situation closely and making resources available to support state, local, tribal, and territorial partners. ASPR has several preparedness elements in place to help stay ahead of the H5N1 virus that is infecting cows. ASPR has personal protective equipment (PPE) and antiviral drugs available in the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS). The National Pre-pandemic Influenza Vaccine Stockpile (NPIVS), managed by the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, contains pre-pandemic influenza vaccine “building blocks” in the form of bulk antigens, the part of vaccine that triggers the immune system to protect against the virus; and adjuvants which reduce the amount of antigen needed to trigger an immune response. PPE The SNS maintains a large inventory of PPE that may be requested to protect health care professionals. SNS is also offering the following types of PPE for workers on farms or related industries where cattle or other infected animals are present: face shields, gloves, NIOSH-approved N95 respirators, elastomeric half-mask respirators, and goggles. ASPR’s mission is to help the country prepare for, respond to, and recover from public health emergencies and disasters. The SNS contributes to this mission as the nation’s largest repository of emergency medical supplies. While many states hold large supplies of PPE in state-held stockpiles, if those stockpiles of PPE are depleted or unavailable, federal supplies managed by SNS may be requested. The HHS Secretary’s Operations Center (SOC) is the initial contact for requesting emergency supplies. The SOC is staffed by ASPR 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and 365 days a year. More information can be found at: Requesting SNS Assets. PPE may also be obtained via the commercial market through the normal supply chain. Vaccines NPIVS holds an array of pre-pandemic bulk antigens to protect against influenza viruses with pandemic potential. The NPIVS maintains sufficient raw materials to rapidly formulate enough vaccine doses to immunize critical care workers and at-risk populations during the early phases of a response. The government has the raw material to make millions of additional doses within weeks, with more to come in the following months. At this time, ASPR is supporting the availability of vaccines if they are needed. Antivirals The SNS contains millions of treatment courses of antiviral drugs, including Tamiflu (oseltamivir), an antiviral drug that treats seasonal flu and is expected to work against H5N1. Tamiflu may reduce the severity of infection if the medicine is taken shortly after the patient is symptomatic. ASPR will make Tamiflu available upon request to jurisdictions that do not have their own stockpiles and are providing resources to support the treatment of symptomatic persons with exposure to birds, cattle, or other animals with confirmed or suspected H5N1 infection. Tamiflu and generic oseltamivir are also available through the normal commercial supply chain.

Since its inception in 2017, Stockton University has received this recognition for the 2018-2019, 2020-2021, 2022-2023 and 2023-2024 flu seasons. The Influenza Honor Roll is open to four categories of honorees: Institutions of Education, Businesses, Community-based Organizations and Health Care Facilities. Institutions from all categories were encouraged to submit applications detailing all implemented influenza-related activities. All institutions named to the New Jersey Influenza Honor Roll are highlighted on the NJDOH website and receive a certificate of recognition. Devon Tapp, director of Health Outreach, Promotion, and Education (HOPE); Stephanie Allen, program assistant of Immunizations for Student Health Services; and Kristen Welsh-Capaldi, health educator, have been instrumental in securing and promoting flu shots by individual appointments through scheduled clinics and at the annual Wellness Day. HOPE’s objective is to promote a healthy campus by increasing access to immunizations for the campus community. This has been achieved by offering flu shots with no out-of-pocket costs for students, faculty and staff. This aligns with one of the Division of Student Affairs’ strategic priorities: cultivating a safe and healthy learning environment. It also aligns with one of the University’s core values of equity, inclusion and social justice, ensuring inclusive opportunities and resources that affirm and support all community members. During the 2023-24 flu season, flu shots were available to students by appointment, and two clinics provided by Southern Jersey Family Medical Centers were held to vaccinate students, staff and faculty. Additionally, Southern Jersey Family Medical Centers provided flu and other vaccines at the annual Wellness Day. A total of 135 individuals received flu vaccinations during the 2023-24 flu season. Tapp felt it was important to include faculty and staff at the flu clinics, so this service was expanded to include the entire campus community. This effort was much appreciated, as reflected by positive feedback from staff and faculty. The Stockton University Health Outreach, Promotion and Education Department hopes to offer these clinics again during the 2024-25 flu season. Look for upcoming information on immunization clinic dates via email, Student Digest and on The Wellness Center at Stockton University Facebook page and Instagram page.

They found that antibody levels were low in people who were or weren't vaccinated against seasonal flu, hinting at little to no pre-existing immunity and that most of the population would be susceptible if the virus changed to a form that more easily spreads among people. "This finding is not unexpected because A(H5N1) viruses have not spread widely in people and are very different from current and recently circulating human seasonal influenza A viruses," the CDC said regarding the study findings, which it included in a regular update on its response activities.The risk to the general public remains low, and so far only three human infections have been reported in connection to the dairy farm outbreaks. All involved people who worked closely with cows.In late May, federal health officials contracted with CSL Seqirus to fill and finish bulk supplies of one of two candidate H5 virus, enough for 4.8 million doses. The CDC has said the vaccine is a good match to the circulating H5N1 strain.Globally, the main threat from the 2.3.4.4b clade viruses seems to be to people who have been exposed to infected animals. In a related development, Finland's health ministry last week announced that it will offer avian flu vaccine to people who may be exposed to the virus, such as poultry and fur-farm workers and veterinarians.The ministry said it will receive a supply of the vaccine as part of a joint procurement among 15 European Union countries and that vaccination will begin as soon as possible. The vaccine was developed by Seqirus UK, Ltd. Dairy herd outbreaks top 100; virus infects more poultryThe US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has confirmed 6 more H5N1 outbreaks in dairy herds, lifting the US total to 102. The latest confirmations involved 5 farms in Colorado and 1 in Iowa.Also, the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship, in two separate statements, has reported three more outbreaks in dairy herds, two more in Sioux County and one in Plymouth County, both in the northwestern part of the state.Meanwhile, Minnesota reported another outbreak in commercial poultry, which involves a turkey farm that houses 33,100 birds in Stearns County in the central part of the state, according to APHIS.

Medscape Medical NewsNew Human Cases of Avian Flu AnticipatedAllison Shelley June 19, 2024 00With avian influenza spreading quickly around the globe, the virus has more opportunities to mutate and cause problems for people. By some calculations, H5N1 bird flu is still at least two mutations away from widespread human infections, but experts warn that new flu symptoms in individuals at high risk are likely to start turning up in health systems this summer."There is a broad range of symptoms to be watching for," said Vivien Dugan, PhD, director of the influenza division at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). "Some of this will not be obvious or at the forefront of our minds."Dugan is leading the team of CDC scientists that is working with partners from the US Department of Agriculture, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and state and local health departments to track and respond to the H5N1 bird flu outbreak currently sweeping through the US.Since 2022, avian influenza A viruses have been detected in more than 9300 wild birds in 50 states and territories and in commercial and backyard flocks."It's a bad situation," said Florian Krammer, PhD, professor of vaccinology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. "Globally, we've seen tons of exposure in cities around the world and even in the birds here in New York City where I am."Birds shed the virus in their saliva, mucous, and feces, so people or other animals with close, unprotected contact with infected birds or their contaminated environments can be infected. And for the first time in March 2024, H5N1 bird flu was reported in dairy cows. The US Department of Agriculture said that at last count 101 dairy herds in 12 states had been infected, with several cases also found in dairy workers.From Birds to Cattle and Farm WorkersThe National Veterinary Services Laboratories confirmed the infections were highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b of Eurasian lineage. Also known as the goose, Guangdong clade from China, phylogenetic analysis and epidemiology suggests a single introduction into cows followed by onward transmission."I was surprised when H5 was introduced to dairy cattle in this way," Dugan said during an interview. "Influenza viruses are always surprising us and it reminds me to stay humble and keep an open mind when dealing with them."People rarely inhale or get sufficient virus in their eyes or mouth to get sick, Dugan said, but those in close contact with animals are still at risk for infection, which could lead to upper respiratory tract symptoms such as shortness of breath, cough, sore throat, or runny or stuffy nose.Like with other viruses, people can also experience muscle or body aches, headache, fatigue, fever or, as was seen in farm workers, conjunctivitis.But there are less-common symptoms too like diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting — and sometimes, even seizures.The risk to the general public is still low, Dugan said, but authorities recommend that people working with animals wash their hands with soap and water and wear personal protective equipment that includes fluid-resistant coveralls, a waterproof apron, a safety-approved respirator, properly fitted goggles or face shield, a head or hair cover, gloves, and boots.Dugan said that healthcare providers often don't take a history of occupational exposures when a patient presents with flu. But with rising rates of bird flu in new animal hosts, "this will be an important next step."Asking Unusual QuestionsThis approach is not standardized on most electronic health records, so these are questions that clinicians will need to initiate themselves."Physicians should ask about work," said Meghan Davis, PhD, associate professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore. "If it's not already on the radar, asking about any direct contact with dairy cows, poultry, pigs, wild birds or wild mammals is important."Davis says she's worried about a new study tracking risk factors for farm-to-farm transmission because it shows that farms testing positive for avian influenza often have workers with a family member also employed on another farm. "This suggests that we might need to be on the lookout for possible transmission within families," she said. Now, we have to ask "not just if the person with symptoms has contact with or works on a dairy farm, milk processing plant, or slaughterhouse, but also if any family member does."Davis said that it's important to bear in mind when taking these histories that there may be younger workers on farms and in slaughter and processing facilities due to exemptions or illegal work.What is important now is to get the situation under control this season in dairy cattle, Krammer said. "This will be easier to stop in cows than humans, so this is the time to stop moving dairy cattle and start vaccinating them."Spotting New CasesSince April 2024, there have been three human cases of avian influenza after exposure to dairy cows reported. "And what we don't want to see this summer is an unusual human cluster of influenza. It's important we keep a close, watchful eye for this," Krammer said."Influenza viruses do very interesting things and as we head into fall and winter flu season, we don't want new human co-infections that could cause major problems for us," he said.If people become mixing vessels of a seasonal cocktail of multiple viruses, that could empower H5N1 to mutate again into something more dangerous, sparking a new pandemic."It wasn't all that long ago that we were asking China difficult questions about the steps Chinese authorities took to protect human lives from SARS-CoV-2 in the COVID pandemic. Now, we must ask ourselves many of these questions," Krammer said. "We are at a crucial crossroad where we will either elude a new pandemic or see one take off, risking 10 to 20 million lives."There is a precedent for safely evading more trouble, Krammer pointed out. Government agencies have already been working with the poultry industry for a couple of years now. "And here, we have successfully stopped H5N1 with new regulations and policies."But moving from poultry farms to cattle has not been an easy transition, Dugan said. Cattle farms have no experience with bird flu or tactics to contain it with regulations, and officials too are working in new, unfamiliar terrain."What we have now isn't a science problem, it's a policy issue, and it hasn't always been clear who is in charge," Krammer said."Agencies are working together at the state, federal, and global level," said Dugan. "We are increasing our transparency and are working to share what we know, when we know it."The infrastructure built during the COVID pandemic has helped teams prepare for this new crisis, Dugan said. Year-round, layered monitoring has clinical labs reporting seasonal influenza and novel cases."Laboratories are ready to help with testing," Dugan said.Specimens should be collected as soon as possible from patients with flu symptoms. A nasopharyngeal swab is recommended with a nasal swab combined with an oropharyngeal swab. If a patient has conjunctivitis with or without respiratory symptoms, both a conjunctival swab and a nasopharyngeal swab should be collected. People with severe respiratory disease should also have lower respiratory tract specimens collected.Standard, contact, and airborne precautions are recommended for patients presenting for medical care who have illness consistent with influenza and recent exposure to birds or other animals.Antiviral DrugsThere are four FDA-approved antivirals for influenza:Oseltamivir phosphate (available as a generic drug or by the trade name Tamiflu)Zanamivir (Relenza)Peramivir (Rapivab) Baloxavir (Xofluza)For people with suspected or confirmed avian influenza, treatment is recommended as soon as possible. There are no clinical trials measuring the outcome of antivirals in people infected with avian influenza. However, data from animal models and human observational studies suggest a benefit."We can't afford to wait this summer," Krammer said. "We have an opportunity right now to stop this in cows before we risk infecting more people. I hope we do." 0CreditLead image: Science Photo Library/Getty ImagesMedscape Medical News © 2024 WebMD, LLCSend comments and news tips to news@medscape.net.

View all partners Email X (Twitter) Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger The spread of the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1 among animals is unprecedented having been found on all continents — except Oceania — with the United Nations calling it “a global zoonotic animal pandemic.” H5N1 is known to be able to infect over 350 species of birds and close to 60 species of mammals with migratory waterfowl — including ducks, swans, geese and gulls — being especially susceptible to various avian-borne influenza viruses. H5N1 infected waterfowl are normally asymptomatic carriers, however, these birds can infect other species (including mammals) along their migratory routes. This global transference allows disease to spread, and for virus genetics and virulence to continually adapt. Alarmingly, evidence indicates that climate change seems to be impacting the emergence of zoonotic viruses like H5N1. As global climate conditions change, avian migratory patterns and routes are also changing. Higher temperatures and extreme weather has resulted in large-scale population shifts in a range of temperate species. These changes have led to diseases emerging in areas — and in genetic configurations — entirely unique and unprecedented. H5N1 is a clear indication that disease monitoring and response efforts are an essential part of any climate change adaptation and mitigation strategy. H5N1 The ecology and genetics of H5N1 viruses have evolved significantly since first being detected in China in 1997. The H5N1 virus has been detected in the polar regions and the first confirmed case of a polar bear dying from H5N1 was recorded in Alaska in 2022. Antarctica has seen significant rates of mortality in its native elephant and fur seal populations as a result of viral exposure. Non-migratory wild birds are highly susceptible to H5N1 infections brought on the wings of their more transitory cousins. There have been approximately 75,000 bird casualties globally as per the World Animal Health Information System. However, efforts to accurately estimate the total number of wild birds which have died as a result of H5N1 are hampered by issues in data quality and availability. Meanwhile, a 2022 report on the state of wild birds in the United States estimated that over three billion birds have been lost in part due to climate related factors. A report on H5N1 produced by PBS NewsHour. On land, the H5N1 virus has been detected in dairy cattle, and in 2024, a Texas agricultural worker was infected with H5N1. These cases suggest that H5N1 is adapting to infect mammalian hosts. In March of this year, reports began to emerge of unusual deaths in young goats on a farm in Minnesota. That same farm had individuals in its poultry flock test positive for H5N1 and the goats and poultry shared similar spaces and water sources. It was later determined that the H5N1 strains in both the poultry and goats were highly related. In May of 2024, the U.S. Department of Agriculture confirmed the detection of H5N1 in alpacas on a farm in Idaho. Similar to previous cases, this farm also had a backyard poultry population test positive for H5N1 with unusually high amounts of the virus detected across the farm. To date, 12 states in the U.S. have reported outbreaks of H5N1 with 101 dairy herds affected. Read more: An ounce of prevention: Now is the time to take action on H5N1 avian flu, because the stakes are enormous The discoveries of H5N1 on farms, alongside recent analysis of viral dispersal patterns, reiterate the importance of climate change shifting the migratory patterns of birds in the spread of viruses around the globe. Climate change and H5N1 There is increasing evidence that climate change is accelerating the global spread and emergence of new H5N1 variants with evidence that wider seasonal variation is enabling the emergence of novel H5N1 variants. In North America, the warmer winters and earlier onset of spring which global warming is causing could allow some moisture-reliant pathogens to survive and spread more easily. Meanwhile, cooler and wetter conditions can enhance the survival of influenza viruses in bird droppings and contaminated water. A California Condor named Hope is seen at the Condor habitat at the Los Angeles Zoo in May 2023. California condors will receive a vaccine for a deadly strain of avian influenza that threatens to wipe out the already threatened vulture species. (AP Photo/Richard Vogel) Simply put, the spread of influenza viruses around the globe is dictated by their ability to survive long enough in a place to be able to transmit elsewhere — and climate change is, in some cases, making this survival more likely. The recent cases of poultry-to-human and cattle-to-human transmissions underscore the threats posed by these viruses and the importance of understanding how climate change is affecting their spread. Implications and mitigation The H5N1 virus poses a significant threat to public health and the recent cases in the U.S. — coupled with H5N1’s high mortality rates in humans — underscores the need for vigilant monitoring. Dealing with viruses is always a challenge, however, climate change is upending many conventional understandings as shifting waterfowl migration patterns and environmental conditions force us to change strategies. Strengthening health-care infrastructure, and educating communities about H5N1 risks are essential components of a comprehensive response strategy. Read more: How climate change influences the spread of disease – four essential reads Promoting sustainable agricultural practices, such as improving biosecurity in poultry and cattle farms, reducing livestock population density and enhancing barn ventilation systems, is crucial. Innovative smart farming technology can also help track viral infections in poultry barns. Conservation efforts are essential to maintain healthy ecosystems and minimize viral spread. Restoring natural habitats can mitigate the effects of climate change on wild bird populations, thereby reducing the risk of H5N1 spillover. In the future, global leaders will need to be vigilant with respect to the trajectory of H5N1. International collaboration on disease management will be crucial for implementing climate adaptation strategies to safeguard the health of both our planet and its inhabitants against viruses like H5N1.

(Alander Rocha/Alabama Reflector) Alabama’s state health officer said Thursday the state was continuing efforts to manage H5N1 avian influenza, commonly known as bird flu. During the Alabama Department of Public Health’s board meeting on Thursday, Dr. Scott Harris said that the department is working with the Department of Agriculture and Industries to address the situation. “It’s really something we really have spent a lot of time working on and thinking about. The public doesn’t seem interested very much in hearing a lot about it, but there’s a lot of great work going on behind the scenes,” Harris said. GET THE MORNING HEADLINES.

Now researchers have developed a low-cost paper strip test that could allow more patients to find out which type of flu they have and get the right treatment. The test, developed by a team from the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard and Princeton University, and supported by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, uses CRISPR to distinguish between the two main types of seasonal flu, influenza A and B, as well as seasonal flu subtypes H1N1 and H3N2. It can also identify strains that resist antiviral treatment, and with further work, could potentially detect swine and avian flu strains, including H5N1, which is currently infecting cattle. Appearing in The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics, the results could help improve outbreak response and clinical care by bringing tests that are accurate, low-cost, and fast to doctors' offices and labs across the US and in other countries. "Ultimately, we hope these tests will be as simple as rapid antigen tests, and they'll still have the specificity and performance of a nucleic acid test that would normally be done in a laboratory setting," said Cameron Myhrvold, co-senior author on the study along with Pardis Sabeti, an institute member at the Broad and a professor at Harvard University and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, as well as a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator. Myhrvold, who is currently an assistant professor at Princeton University, was a postdoctoral researcher in Sabeti's lab when the study began. SHINE a light The test is based on a technology called SHINE, which was developed by Sabeti's lab in 2020 and uses CRISPR enzymes to identify specific sequences of viral RNA in samples. The researchers first used SHINE to test for SARS-CoV-2, and later to distinguish between the Delta and Omicron variants. Then, in 2022, they began adapting the assay to detect other viruses they knew were always circulating: influenzas. They wanted to create tests that could be used in the field or in clinics rather than hospitals or diagnostic labs with expensive equipment. "Using a paper strip readout instead of expensive fluorescence machinery is a big advancement, not only in terms of clinical care but also for epidemiological surveillance purposes," said Ben Zhang, co-first author on the study, a medical student at Harvard Medical School and an undergraduate researcher in Sabeti's lab when the study began. Typical diagnostic approaches such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) require lengthy processing times, trained personnel, specialized equipment, and freezers to store reagents at -80°C, whereas SHINE can be conducted at room temperature in about 90 minutes. Currently, the assay only requires an inexpensive heat block to warm the reaction, and the researchers are working to streamline the process with the goal of returning results in 15 minutes. The researchers also adapted SHINE to distinguish between different flu strains. In the future, they say the assay could be adapted to detect two different viruses with similar symptoms, such as influenza and SARS-CoV-2. Being able to tease apart what strain or subtype of influenza is infecting a patient has repercussions both for treating them and public health interventions."

In the field, rapid testing could also help scientists collect samples more strategically during an outbreak to better monitor how the virus is spreading. Next, the researchers are adapting SHINE to test for both avian and swine influenza strains. "With SARS-CoV-2 and now flu, we've shown that we can easily adapt SHINE to detect new or evolving viruses," Arizti-Sanz said. "We're excited to apply it to H5N1."

ElrickNeal RubinObserver & EccentricUSA TODAY Scientists try to solve bird flu mystery: Why there's so much virus in Michigan wastewaterKristen Jordan Shamus Detroit Free PressShow Caption Hide Caption Health officials detail bird flu transmission to humans. What we know.Health officials are urging caution with where consumers get their milk as they investigate bird flu deaths in humans. Here's what we know.Newly released wastewater surveillance data suggests Michigan is a national hot spot for the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus that's infecting poultry, dairy cows and other mammals across the U.S., and has also been identified in three farmworkers — two in Michigan.Researchers told the Free Press they're still trying to understand exactly why samples from all six of Michigan's wastewater testing sites monitored by WastwaterSCAN show high levels of the H5 influenza A virus — the most detections of any of the 38 states with sampling sites — even in areas like Jackson and Warren, where there are no known H5N1 outbreaks among dairy cows, poultry or people this year."It's clear that there's something going on," said Marisa Eisenberg, an associate professor in the departments of epidemiology, complex systems and mathematics at the University of Michigan. "We have had questions like: Are we having so much activity for H5N1 in general in Michigan because we're looking for it or is it that we are really a hot spot? I think the wastewater is really telling us that we actually are seeing more activity for H5 than other places are."Now as for why, that is a fascinating question. I don't feel like we have a handle on it yet."Among the questions scientists are trying to answer:Are there more infected dairy cattle in the state than is currently known?Are people unknowingly infected, carrying the virus and excreting H5 particles into the wastewater system?Or is there some other source that's causing Michigan's H5 wastewater detections to rise above other states?WastewaterSCAN, which is based at Stanford University and monitors infectious diseases through wastewater systems, publicly posted the results of H5 influenza A virus testing of samples from 38 of the 50 states and the District of Columbia dating to May 21.Only six states had detections of the virus in the wastewater — California, Idaho, Iowa, Minnesota, Michigan and Texas — as of Monday. Of them all, Michigan was the only state with high levels detected at each of its six testing sites: Ann Arbor, Jackson, Jenison, Mount Pleasant, Traverse City and Warren.Even though Jackson County has yet to identify any infections among dairy cattle with the H5N1 influenza A virus, the highest number of positive wastewater samples, 10, were identified at the city of Jackson's Wastewater Treatment Plant from May 21-June 9.The city of Warren's Wastewater Treatment Plant had the second highest number of H5 influenza detections in wastewater samples statewide with five identified from May 21-June 11, but Macomb County also has no known dairy cattle outbreaks.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday that blood sample tests suggest Americans have "extremely low to no population immunity" to the H5N1 virus strain circulating now. Seasonal flu vaccines don't appear to have produced any antibodies to the virus.That means "most of the population would be susceptible to infection from this virus if it were to start infecting people easily and spreading from person-to-person," the CDC said.Sleuthing the source of H5 virus in wastewaterExcrement doesn't lie when it comes to infectious disease."Clearly, there's a lot of virus in the wastewater," said Richard Webby, director of the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals and Birds and a member of the faculty at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.Whether that virus is coming from waste runoff from cattle farms with infected cows or other animals, discharge of untreated milk into the wastewater system from production facilities, or someplace else, however, isn't easy to untangle."The wastewater takes the genetic material from the virus and we know there's a lot of genetic material from the virus in milk. Is it just milk being detected in the wastewater?" Webby hypothesized. "Somebody drinks milk, that goes through the digestive tract and is detected at the other end? Maybe."H5N1 viral particles have been identified in pasteurized milk in the commercial market, and though those particles are inactive and not capable of causing infection, it is possible they could be detected by testing samples of wastewater, said Alessandro Zulli, a postdoctoral scholar at Stanford University who works with WastewaterSCAN on research and wastewater sampling for viruses."There's a good chance that the little sort of snippet that we measure, the amplicon, could still be present in wastewater," Zulli said. "Now, that depends on a lot of factors. It depends on whether people are dumping a bunch of milk down the drain; it's unlikely, I think, that it would pass through your entire digestive system without being further broken apart."Eisenberg agreed that Michigan's high rate of H5 virus detections in wastewater isn't likely driven by milk drinkers who've excreted viral particles into the wastewater system."Everyone is drinking milk" in every state nationally, she said. "So if it was just milk, regular milk that you're buying at the store, I feel like we would be seeing much more widespread detections" across the U.S.She is investigating whether milk production plants near Jackson and Warren discharge milk into the catchment areas where wastewater samples are drawn. Eisenberg said she is also curious about septage.More: How Michigan became ground zero for H5 avian influenza in the US"Are there septic tank companies that ... pull from septic tanks, but then it goes into the wastewater treatment plant?" she asked. "The wastewater treatment plants sometimes will accept septage from septic tank companies."We're still at the hypothesis-generating stage. There's some ponds and wetlands that go into the wastewater system. So could it be wild birds or is there some septage that's coming from Jackson's neighboring counties that have had cattle detections? Maybe it's something like that?"She wondered whether all the dairy farms in Jackson County have been tested for H5N1 infections, too."We're still trying to get to the bottom of it," Eisenberg said.In Macomb County, Eisenberg said, some major dairy processing operations occur within the catchment area of the wastewater treatment plant in Warren, "which might explain the positives there."Webby said he doubts Michigan's H5N1 outbreaks in poultry and cattle — or its high wastewater detections — are linked to migratory bird activity in the state. Michigan is part of the Mississippi Flyway."We can say with some certainty that it's not because you're a flyway," Webby said. "This is based on looking at the sequences of the viruses that are available from this outbreak," which suggest the virus is being spread from cow-to-cow and cow-to-person in the state, and not bird-to-cow or bird-to-person.Zulli agreed that wild birds probably aren't driving up H5 wastewater detections in Michigan."There is some speculation about how bird waste could get into the wastewater stream, but it's unlikely," he said. "In some of our previous retrospective studies, we haven't been able to see it before from bird waste. I mean, of course, as it gets more widespread in birds, the chances of it actually ending up in the wastewater stream increase. But we currently don't really think that it's intrusion from bird wastewater so much as it is from either permitted discharges of dairy cattle farms or other runoff of that type."A lot more work is necessary before we can extrapolate and say where exactly it's coming from or whether the contributions are from humans or animals."'This is the most active form of virus we have ever had'The wastewater data poses new questions as the H5N1 virus continues to spread nationally, infecting 92 dairy cattle herds in 12 states as of Friday and more than 96 million poultry in 48 states, according to the CDC.In Michigan, H5N1 outbreaks have disrupted operations at 25 dairy cattle farms across 10 counties, cutting the animals' milk production and eating into farmers' already slim profit margins, according to the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development.The state's commercial egg and poultry farms also have felt the economic sting of the virus, as operations in 23 counties over the last two years have culled at least 6.8 million domestic birds infected with avian influenza.So far, this strain of the avian influenza virus circulating in the U.S., identified as highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b, has caused only mild illness in people who were infected after working closely with sick cows; all fully recovered. Two of the dairy farmworkers had eye infections, known as conjunctivitis or pink eye. A third reported upper respiratory tract symptoms. Federal and state health leaders say the risk among the general public is low.The concern among many scientists, though, is how this virus is adapting and changing — and whether some of those changes might make it more infectious, allow for human-to-human transmission, reduce the effectiveness of current antiviral drugs or cause more severe illness or a higher mortality rate."Over the past 25 years of this virus, this is the most active form of virus we have ever had," Webby said. "We're seeing far more mammals infected with this virus in the past three years than we probably have over the whole 23 years before this. And now it has found its way into cows."Every corner we turn, this virus is teaching us something we didn't know. This time, it's that it can actually replicate in cows. ... It was a surprise to most of us."Right now, it looks like it is still the virus that is in birds with maybe a few little changes. But we want to be able to know if this virus is changing, is it becoming more dangerous for humans? Is it becoming more dangerous for cows and other animals as well?"Virus can hitch a rideThe USDA published an epidemiological report Thursday based on Michigan's dairy and poultry outbreak, and found that the virus likely is being spread by animal and human movement from farms with infected poultry and cows to those without.The virus can hitch a ride from farm to farm on the soles of workers' boots, on the wheels of cars, trucks and trailers as well as on farming equipment if they all are not cleaned and sanitized properly, the USDA found.About 20% of the dairy farms the federal agency analyzed in Michigan shared workers with other farming operations and 13% had workers or family members who also worked on poultry farms. Many used veterinarians, nutritionists, feed consultants, milk haulers and other contractors who had direct contact with cattle on multiple dairy farms and shared vehicles across farms."Based on the epidemiological findings, the majority of links between affected dairy premises, and between dairy and poultry premises, are indirect from shared people, vehicles, and equipment," the report said, recommending increased biosecurity practices and efforts to identify as many infected herds as possible.But it's not easy to get farm operators or farmworkers to agree to testing. And though Michigan has done more testing than many other states, that doesn't fully explain why Michigan leads the nation in H5N1 infected dairy herds, people, and now, wastewater detections."I think there is a lot of surprise at the actual lack of testing that's actually going on," Webby said. "Other countries are in different positions where federal agencies can say, 'I'm coming on your farm to test animals,' which is not of course how it's done here."Testing animals and people with symptoms is recommended, but not required in the U.S."From the perspective of an owner of a farm, I can understand to some extent some reluctance to test," Webby said. "It is a disease that is not causing a lot of mortality on a farm. Any test right now can be associated, of course, with a quarantine period where cows can't move and the substantial economic hit that comes with it, even though I think there are some funds coming available to help with that. So you can understand from an economic perspective, reluctance to test cows."With the humans, there's probably some of that as well. ... It's a heavily sort of migrant population that works on the farms, perhaps with questionable documentation. The last thing that population wants to do is have anyone from any federal agency going out, and asking for any sort of name, phone numbers or addresses."But until there is more widespread testing of animals and people, Webby said, it's difficult to answer a lot of the important questions that remain about this virus, such as: How is it moving around the farm? How long are cows infectious? What does it look like when cows get reinfected? Can they be reinfected?"Without a lot more testing being done, we're a bit hamstrung in understanding exactly what's going on," he said.Bird flu's financial impact on dairy farms is significantMichigan ranks in the top 10 nationally for dairy production. It is the biggest sector of the state's agricultural economy, with $15.7 billion in annual economic activity, of which $2.7 billion comes from milk alone, according to MDARD."Fifteen percent of a dairy herd tends to test positive for this on an affected farm and there's some corresponding drops in milk production," said MDARD Director Tim Boring during testimony Wednesday before a joint meeting of the state House and Senate natural resources and agriculture committees. "Many cows never come back to full milk production. So we're building out an understanding of what the economic impact for a lot of farms is."The USDA said 80% of farms with infected cattle reported abnormal lactation and less food intake; 90% of farms reported dairy cattle produced thickened or clotted milk.State Rep. Jerry Neyer, R-Shepherd, whose family owns a dairy farm, said a decline of 15% of milk production in a herd could financially devastate farmers."For whatever reason, this virus seems to focus in on the mammary system in dairy," he said. "That's where it's noticed, in production. It doesn't seem to affect young livestock and non-milk production livestock cattle in the same way that affects the cow that's producing."When you go off production even by just 10%, that's your profit margin."And while there are losses in milk production to dairy farms, there also are increased costs for veterinary care for sick cows, for testing of animals and farmworkers, and costs to provide personal protective equipment to workers and test any who have symptoms. Some cows have lost pregnancies. Some have had to be put down.Then there are the additional downstream effects."There's a lot more time being spent tending to sick cows than doing things like planting corn or cutting silage or haylage in a timely fashion, and any number of additional aspects on farms that just aren't getting done," Boring said.Farms with infected cattle also are required to take biosecurity measures to help ensure that when people enter or leave, they don't bring the virus along with them on their clothing, vehicles or equipment. That means adding washing facilities. All of that costs money.To soften the financial blow for affected Michigan dairy farms, Boring announced Wednesday that MDARD, in partnership with the USDA, will begin issuing $28,000 grants to 20 affected dairy cattle farms in the state."We know that the burden of working through questionnaires and having researchers on farms is significant," Boring said. "So we're looking to take some initial steps here and we'll share details in the days to come ... around what that looks like."Outlook appears to be improving for poultry outbreaksMichigan's commercial egg and poultry farms, an $8.5 billion industry in the state, haven't escaped the avian influenza scourge, either.Since the first Michigan flocks were infected in 2022, the virus has hit domestic poultry farms and backyard flocks in 23 counties. This year alone, there've been outbreaks in eight flocks across four counties — Newaygo, Gratiot, Ottawa and Ionia.The virus behaves differently in birds, killing as many as 90% of domestic poultry that become infected."It is a fatal disease in birds and the simplest way to get rid of it, unfortunately, is just killing them or putting them down," Neyer said. "In the long run, it is the kindest thing you can do. Until we have some type of vaccine for it, there isn't much alternative to that."Farmers in Neyer's 92nd state House District, which includes portions of Gratiot and Isabella counties, have been hit hard, by the virus, he said, with multiple outbreaks on both poultry and dairy farms.Herbruck's Poultry Ranch, the largest egg producer in Michigan and the 10th largest in the United States, temporarily laid off 400 of its workers in May after an avian influenza outbreak struck its flock, forcing it to kill hens and destroy eggs.More: 2nd Michigan farmworker has contracted avian influenza from cow, health officials sayMore: Michigan farmworker is second US case of H5N1bird flu likely transmitted from cow to humanThe good news, Boring said, is that the pace of new H5N1 outbreaks among commercial and backyard poultry flocks has slowed in Michigan. May 9 was the last time the virus was detected in a backyard flock in Ionia County. The last outbreak on a commercial poultry operation in Michigan was May 2 in Gratiot County, according to MDARD.Because the virus has been infecting poultry for two years, the USDA has had time to stand up "really robust efforts in conjunction with state and industry partners ... for animal disease preparedness and response," Boring said. "There's well-established procedures. There's well-established capacity within the system to be responding in real time ... based on response of the unique characteristics of how the disease manifests itself in poultry."There also are financial supports in place to help commercial poultry operations weather the economic hit they take when their entire flocks are culled as a result of infection."It's going to be an evolving situation," Boring said. "We're going to be seeing concerns on this, I think, for a bit here, and we're going to continue to really prioritize the work on the human health aspect for what those the potential (mutations) of the virus are. But I think that the piece to really focus on here is the fact that we've got effective food safety programs, human and animal safety programs. And the story here is the fact that the system is working as intended and protecting human and public health."Eisenberg said she and others at U-M are also working to create their own wastewater surveillance system of H5 viruses to help inform the state health department at sites in Jackson, Ann Arbor, Tecumseh and Flint."I'm expecting we'll see positives for H5," she said.Contact Kristen Shamus: kshamus@freepress.com.

The order issued by the Department requires that lactating dairy cattle be tested and show negative results for HPAI within seven days prior to entering a fair, including the Great New York State Fair, county fairs, or other exhibitions. The test must be conducted by an approved National Animal Health Laboratory Network (NAHLN) lab.State Agriculture Commissioner Richard A. Ball said, “With the kick-off of summer fair season just a few weeks away, we want to remain vigilant about the concerns of HPAI in dairy cattle we are seeing across the country and ensure we are doing all we can to keep our livestock safe and healthy here in New York. By requiring this testing protocol, which will be covered, we hope to minimize the risk of the spread of HPAI while providing the opportunity for the summer traditions of entering and showing of dairy cattle at fairs and exhibitions to continue.”State Health Commissioner Dr. James McDonald said, “The Department of Health supports this latest biosurveillance protocol as we enter the summer fair season in an effort to prevent the spread avian influenza in dairy cattle in New York State. As a reminder, there are still no known cases of avian influenza in livestock or in humans in New York State, and we will continue to work with the Department of Agriculture and Markets to monitor the situation and prepare for any potential risks to public health and safety.”The Department encourages industry members to follow these steps in addition to the state’s order to help ensure the health and safety of animals at county fairs across New York, in addition to The Great New York State Fair. Animal health requirements for 2024 county fairs and The New York State Fair are outlined in three documents, listed below. These documents currently apply to animals, including poultry, at fairs in 2024.https://agriculture.ny.gov/animals/fair-health-requirementshttps://agriculture.ny.gov/animals/interstate-health-requirements-fair-animalshttps://agriculture.ny.gov/animals/exhibitor-prefair-guidelinesAdditionally, in April, the state issued temporary import requirements for dairy cattle coming into New York and continues to urge farm owners and farm workers to practice good biosecurity measures, which include restricting on-farm access to employees and essential personnel; providing farm-dedicated work boots for all workers that are not worn anywhere else; preventing cattle from drinking from sources that may be contaminated by waterfowl; preventing wild birds from accessing feed sources and making sure all feed spills are cleaned up; and contact your veterinarian if you suspect your cattle are showing signs of HPAI.Additional biosecurity recommendations can be found here. Biosecurity involves all the actions taken to reduce or eliminate the spread of the virus, which includes biosurveillance measures which involves monitoring for sick animals.The Department’s order aligns with the United States Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) recent recommendations to minimize influenza transmission at dairy cattle livestock exhibitions, including a recommendation that lactating animals moving interstate to an exhibition, show, or sale must have a negative test result from samples collected within seven days of movement. Producers and veterinarians are encouraged to continue visiting the USDA APHIS website for the latest information. View the full recommendations at aphis.usda.gov/sites/default/files/guidance-dairy-cattle-livestock-exhibition.pdf.USDA also recently announced expanded support for producers to help stop the spread of HPAI in dairy cattle, including for producers who do not have a herd that has tested positive. This support equips producers with tools they can use to keep their herds and workers healthy and reduce risk of the virus spreading to additional herds. These financial tools include supporting biosecurity planning and implementation; reimbursing producers for veterinary costs associated with sample collection for testing, and offsetting shipping costs for influenza A testing at laboratories in the National Animal Health Laboratory Network.Since the first detection of HPAI in dairy cattle in March, HPAI has now been found in dairy cattle and goats in 12 states. No cases have been detected in New York livestock to date. The Department has issued a statewide alert to veterinarians urging them to contact the Department if they see any signs or symptoms of illness in farm animals.Clinical signs seen in affected cattle:decreased milk production;acute sudden drop in production with some severely impacted cows experiencing thicker, concentrated milk;decrease in feed consumption; abnormal feces; and low-grade fever.Clinical signs seen in affected newborn goats:Unusual deathsIf any of these symptoms are noted, veterinarians are urged to call the Department at (518) 457-3502 for sampling guidance. USDA APHIS continues to study how the virus is believed to be spread and additional information on that can be found here.According to USDA and the FDA, pasteurized milk and pasteurized dairy products remain safe to consume as pasteurization kills harmful microbes and pathogens in milk and there is also no concern regarding the consumption of properly cooked meat products. Information regarding HPAI and milk safety can be found here.

Becker, and Ewa KingJune 18, 2024 Reprints With the H5N1 bird flu outbreak, the current risk to the general public is low, though individuals with job-related or recreational exposure to infected cattle are at higher risk for infection. Robert F. Bukaty/AP A third case of mammal-to-human transmission of the highly pathogenic H5N1 bird flu virus has been reported in the United States. This latest case, involving a dairy worker in Michigan, raises concerns due to the individual exhibiting respiratory symptoms, highlighting the pandemic potential of this virus. U.S. hospitals need to prepare for the worst and hope for the best. The three human cases of H5N1 in the U.S. — the first one in Texas and the others in Michigan — are not connected to each other. Fortunately, all three individuals experienced mild symptoms and have fully recovered, with no additional cases detected. These infections are part of a broader epidemic affecting dairy cattle, with more than 90 herds infected across 12 states. Wastewater surveillance has shown increased detections of influenza A in certain areas. Bird flu is in the family of influenza A so any increase observed can be implicated with H5N1 or other influenza A viruses, such as H1N1 and H3N2 that routinely circulate in people. While there is yet no evidence of human-to-human transmission of the H5N1 virus, this could emerge at any time, underscoring the urgent need for hospitals to bolster their preparedness for potential additional human cases of H5N1.advertisement The current risk to the general public is low, though individuals with job-related or recreational exposure to infected birds, cattle, or other animals are at higher risk for infection. To date, no severe illness or deaths from H5N1 have been reported in the U.S., though the virus is known to be deadly. Since the first human outbreak in 1997 in Hong Kong, more than 900 sporadic cases have been reported in 23 countries, with more than half resulting in death. As leaders in health care and public health, we recognize the important role hospitals play in outbreak detection and response, and mitigating the spread of infectious diseases. With H5N1 posing a potentially significant public health threat, hospitals must adopt proactive, comprehensive strategies to prepare for, reduce the threat of, and respond to potential cases. Here are four strategies we recommend hospitals implement: Actively check people for H5N1 infection Testing is the first step in detecting and managing people with H5N1 bird flu. Clinicians should consider testing people showing signs or symptoms of acute respiratory illness or conjunctivitis with relevant exposure history, especially anyone who has had contact with potentially infected sick or dead birds, livestock, or other animals within 10 days of the onset of symptoms. Clinical presentations can range from mild conjunctivitis and upper respiratory symptoms to severe pneumonia and multi-organ failure.advertisement Further readingGo deeper: H5N1 bird flu Here are the bird flu questions top scientists would like to see answered. Michigan is doing more bird flu testing than any other state. Will others follow? Producing a H5N1 vaccine is more complicated than you might think. And the world would need a lot of it. And finally, an important avian flu precaution: Don't drink raw milk. It is crucial for clinicians to understand that cases of H5N1 bird flu can occur without any known links to infected animals, animal products, or contaminated sources (such as equipment), so it’s important to test individuals who exhibit H5N1 symptoms, regardless of their exposure history. Public health authorities, who control whether testing for H5N1 should be conducted at a public health laboratory, should be flexible and allow clinicians to test patients for H5N1 based on their own clinical judgement and who may not fit the specific criteria for H5N1 — like being in direct contact with an infected animal — as the risk for being infected with H5N1 is evolving. Strengthen communication and coordination with local public health partners Through the national and state Influenza Surveillance Report currently in place, hospitals, clinics, and community providers are essential for public health surveillance for seasonal influenza, including detecting novel strains like H5N1. Identifying various viral subtypes is typically done in public health laboratories. As such, effective communication and coordination between clinicians and local health departments are crucial for diagnosing and managing human H5N1 cases. Increased awareness of H5N1 among clinicians is important for recognizing potential infections in humans and initiating public health investigations. For individuals directly exposed to dairy cows, birds, or other animals that can carry H5N1, or those in at-risk groups, clinicians should be thinking H5N1 if there are signs, symptoms, and a positive influenza A test and immediately contact their local public health departments for subtyping. All hospitals have the ability to test for influenza A, since this family of viruses includes the normally circulating flu strains they see every flu season. Individuals who do not have obvious exposure to H5N1 but have flu strains that are not H1N1 or H3N2, the typical seasonal flu strains, should be evaluated for H5N1 at public health laboratories. Testing for other causes of acute respiratory illness, including SARS-CoV-2, should also be considered based on local epidemiology of circulating respiratory viruses. Related: In dribs and drabs, USDA reports suggest containing bird flu outbreak in dairy cows will be challenging Educate health care workers Health care workers are the frontline defenders in responding to outbreaks, acting as public health eyes and ears in the fight against infectious diseases. Their preparedness is vital for public health. To ensure effective monitoring and response to potential H5N1 cases, all clinicians must be educated on CDC guidelines for identifying infections, initiating antiviral treatment, and notifying health departments for testing. Training should cover H5N1 criteria and definition of risk factors for infection with H5N1, proper notification procedures to the health department to initiate testing, and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) to prevent transmission. Early identification of infections is essential to control spread and protect health care workers. The CDC’s updated webpage is a valuable resource for current outbreak information. Incorporate public education and outreach Public education is vital for a hospital’s preparedness strategy. While the CDC states the current risk to the general public from H5N1 is low, preventive measures are essential, especially with the increased consumption of raw milk, a potential means of transmission. Public recommendations include avoiding contact with infected or dead animals and potentially contaminated surfaces or equipment, using PPE when necessary, and avoiding undercooked or raw foods such as unpasteurized milk. Hospitals should engage in community outreach to disseminate this information and encourage individuals to seek medical care if they suspect an infection. The emergence of an H5N1 bird flu epidemic in the U.S. highlights the persistent threat of this virus. Hospitals must beef up their preparedness by implementing robust screening protocols, strengthening communication with public health partners, educating health care workers, and engaging in public outreach. These steps support the public health response to H5N1 and mitigate risks. Ongoing vigilance and readiness are crucial to protecting public health and health care workers.

However, direct serological evidence linked to susceptibility is limited. Here we analysed haemagglutination-inhibition titres in 1,451 cross-sectional samples collected between 1992 and 2020, from individuals born between 1917 and 2008, against influenza B virus (IBV) isolates from 1940 to 2021. We included testing of ‘future’ isolates that circulated after sample collection. We show that immunological biases are conferred by early life IBV infection and result in lineage-specific cross-reactivity of a birth cohort towards future IBV isolates. This translates into differential estimates of susceptibility between birth cohorts towards the B/Yamagata and B/Victoria lineages, predicting lineage-specific birth-cohort distributions of observed medically attended IBV infections. Our data suggest that immunological measurements of imprinting could be important in modelling and predicting virus epidemiology.

Juhan Sonin / Flickr cc The patient is a 41-year man from Fujian province in the country's southeast whose symptoms began on May 8. He had severe pneumonia and was hospitalized, where his respiratory samples tested positive on May 14. He died from his infection. The report did not say how the man is thought to have contracted the virus.China's last H5N6 case, reported in May, was also from Fujian province and likewise fatal. H5N6 is known to circulate in poultry in China and a few other Asian countries. Infections in humans are often severe or fatal. So far only China and Laos have reported H5N6 cases in people. The WHO said the man's illness raises the number of H5N6 cases to 92 and the fatality total to 37. Rebyota fecal transplant offers durable protection after antibiotic exposure, study finds News brief Chris Dall, MA Topics Antimicrobial Stewardship Clostridium difficile CDC / Jennifer Oosthuizen A microbiota-based live biotherapeutic for treating recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (rCDI) remained effective after subsequent antibiotic exposure, researchers reported this week in Open Forum Infectious Diseases.In a post-hoc analysis of a phase 2 trial evaluating the safety, efficacy, and durability of Rebyota fecal microbiota transplantation for preventing rCDI, the researchers evaluated patients who received non-CDI antibiotics for up to 2 years after Rebyota administration. Although Rebyota has been found to be highly effective in preventing rCDI and was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in December 2022, the researchers wanted to assess the durability of the treatment response, particularly in patients subsequently exposed to antibiotics, which can disrupt the gut microbiome and increase the risk of rCDI. They looked specifically at non-CDI antibiotics, because any recurrence of CDI would require antibiotic treatment.Treatment response was defined as the absence of CDI diarrhea needing retreatment as of the last evaluable time point (8 weeks, 6 months, 1 year, or 2 years) after Rebyota administration.Durable responseOf the 149 participants in the trial, 43 received non-CDI antibiotics after Rebyota administration over a 2-year period. Across all evaluable time points, 37 of 43 (86%) had treatment response regardless of when non-CDI antibiotic exposure occurred, with treatment response rates ranging from 83% to 96% at the various time points. Among participants with treatment response, success was sustained for a median of 470 days from the first initial non-CDI antibiotic use. Of the six participants who experienced rCDI, 5 received a high-risk antibiotic. Although the study was limited by lack of a control group and other factors, the researchers say the findings provide evidence that Reboyota offers durable protection after antibiotic exposure in a real-world population."Irrespective of the inherent limitations of this analysis, these results suggest RBL [Rebyota] may restore the gut microbiota to a sufficient threshold protective against rCDI for many patients despite subsequent non-CDI antibiotic use," they wrote. Analysis finds jump in extensively drug-resistant gonorrhea in Cambodia News brief Chris Dall, MA Topics Antimicrobial Stewardship Gonorrhea Sexually Transmitted Infections Analysis of gonorrhea samples in Cambodia found sustained transmission of ceftriaxone-resistant strains and a threefold jump in extensively drug-resistant (XDR) isolates, researchers reported this week in Emerging Infectious Diseases. iLexx / iStock For the study, researchers with Cambodia's National Center for HIV/AIDS, Dermatology, and Sexually Transmitted Diseases and the World Health Organization (WHO) performed antimicrobial susceptibility tests and genomic analysis on 72 Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates collected in 2023 through the WHO's Enhanced Gonococcal Antimicrobial Surveillance Program (EGASP). Under EGASP protocols, public health alerts are sent upon identification of strains approaching resistance.A 'substantial threat' for gonorrhea controlEGASP alert minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for ceftriaxone and cefixime—two first-line treatment options for gonorrhea—were detected in 22 (31%) of 72 isolates, a proportion similar to that reported in 2022 (38%). But 9 isolates (12.5%) had the XDR phenotype, which combines ceftriaxone resistance and high-level azithromycin resistance, and all belonged to the same sequence type (ST-16406). That's up from 4% in 2022. In addition, the percentage of isolates with high resistance to ciprofloxacin and penicillin remained high (82% to 97%).Genomic analysis of 54 isolates with ceftriaxone alert MICS in 2022 and 2023 found that 50 carried the same resistance mutation (the penA-60.001 allele), and 4 harbored recently described or novel mutations. Furthermore, sequences from only 8 isolates clustered with a widely disseminated, ceftriaxone-resistant clone (FC428)."Our data provide further evidence for sustained transmission of N. gonorrhoeae strains with elevated MICs for ceftriaxone and increased expansion of isolates with elevated MICs to ceftriaxone and azithromycin that genomically cluster with the XDR N. gonorrhoeae phenotype," the study authors wrote. "Furthermore, strains with elevated MICs for ceftriaxone continue to emerge across different phylogenetic backbones separate from the previously described FC428 clone, confirming concerns that biological fitness is not compromised by that allele and consequently poses a substantial threat for gonococcal disease control."They add that the findings, combined with recent reports of rising ceftriaxone resistance in China, highlight the need to prioritize gonococcal antimicrobial resistance surveillance across the Asia-Pacific region. Dengue surge in the Americas tops 9 million cases News brief Lisa Schnirring Topics Dengue For the first half of 2024, dengue cases in the Americas region have already surpassed yearly maximums, and cases have already doubled those of 2023, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) said this week in its latest epidemiologic update. frank600 / iStock So far more than 9.3 million cases have been reported by 43 countries and territories. About half were lab confirmed. Of the total, 9,592 were severe and 4,529 were fatal. Six countries accounted for nearly all the deaths: mostly Brazil, followed by Argentina, Peru, Paraguay, Colombia, and Ecuador.Compared to both 2023 and 5-year case averages, cases were up most sharply in the Caribbean region, followed by the Southern Cone, Central America and Mexico, and Andean-region countries. All 4 serotypes circulatingAll four dengue virus serotypes have been circulating in the Americas, with levels varying by country. All four are circulating simultaneously in Brazil, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, and Panama.The agency urged countries to continue their surveillance, diagnosis, treatment, and vector control activities. PAHO also said clustering of cases is also common with diseases including dengue, chikungunya, and Zika. "Efforts should be made to analyze the spatial distribution of cases to enable a rapid response at the local level in the most affected areas," it said. "Information from the hotspots of the three diseases should be targeted for intensive vector control." Report details effective Tpoxx distribution in LA County News brief Stephanie Soucheray, MA Topics Mpox Today in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, authors describe the distribution of the antiviral drug tecovirimat (Tpoxx) in Los Angeles County during the 2022-23 global mpox outbreak, which was spread largely among men who have sex with men.Los Angeles was one of the epicenters of the mpox outbreak in the United States, and public health officials quickly developed a hub-and-spoke distribution model to deliver the antivirals to those who had been exposed to the virus, consisting of 44 hub facilities serving 456 satellite sites across the county, with two-thirds being clinics or pharmacies. This strategy was built on the COVID-19 vaccine rollout."This strategy was built on the COVID-19 vaccine rollout, for which clinics and pharmacies were crucial to vaccine distribution networks," the authors said. Median time to treatment was 2 days Thirty-nine percent of all California mpox cases occurred in Los Angeles County, the most populous county in the state. By January 31, 2023, 2,281 patients with mpox were reported in the county, and approximately one-third (735; 32%) had been treated with tecovirimat."120 (16%) patients who received tecovirimat were treated at pharmacies, 227 (31%) at hospitals, and 388 (53%) at community clinics," the authors wrote. The median interval from specimen collection to treatment was 2 days, and the average patient age was 38."Overall, the distribution strategy was effective and sufficient to meet increasing needs. Similar strategies might benefit tecovirimat distribution in different jurisdictions as would other prepositioned therapeutics for mpox or future emerging infections," the authors concluded.

This randomized open-label pilot trial aimed to verify noninferiority of a 3- versus 7-day prophylaxis with oral oseltamivir in hospitalized children. Influenza contacts were randomized to the 3- or 7-day group and efficacy, relative risk of adverse events (AEs), and the cumulative costs of drugs and AEs management were compared. The intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis included 59 children (n = 28 and n = 31 in the 3- and 7-day group, respectively). The efficacy was 100% (95% CI 87.7–100%) versus 93.6% (95% CI 78.6–99.2%) in the 3- and 7-day group; the differences were statistically insignificant. A per-protocol (PP) analysis including 56 patients (n = 27 and n = 29, respectively) showed 100% (95% CI 87.2–100%) and 93.1% (95% CI 77.2–99.2%) efficacy, respectively, without statistical significance. Differences were within the predefined noninferiority margin with an efficacy difference Δ = 6.45 percentage points (p.p.) with 1-sided 95% CI (− 2.8, − 1.31, p = 0.86; ITT) and Δ = 6.9 p.p. (1-sided 95% CI − 2.83, − 1.27, p = 0.85; PP). Adverse events did not differ significantly, while the cumulative costs of the prophylaxis and AEs management were higher in the 7-day group (median 10.5 euro vs. 4.5 euro, p < 0.01). This pilot study showed the noninferiority of the 3-day versus 7-day PEP, which was associated with lower costs.Trial registration number: NCT04297462, 5th March 2020, restrospectively registered.

Influenza attack rate varies between 8.7%5 and 15.2%1 in children, with estimates for symptomatic and asymptomatic influenza combined reaching 22.5%6. The disease course may vary from mild to fatal, with the highest mortality observed in the youngest group of patients7,8. Except for age, a variety of underlying health conditions are recognised risk factors for severe influenza; while early use of antivirals in the case of hospitalization has been associated with shorter hospitalization, decreased risk of readmission, intensive care or death in children, there still exist many barriers impeding treatment implementation even in the vulnerable population9,10,11. Although vaccines have been available for many years, and a vaccination is the method of choice for influenza prevention, in the case of the need for an urgent outbreak control in a hospital, low vaccine coverage and uncertainty on vaccine effectiveness might make this measure suboptimal12,13.The postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) may be indicated by individual patient’s characteristics (e.g. patients in high-risk group of a severe disease course) or epidemiological reasons14. In hospitalized children antiviral prophylaxis may be driven by both individual indications or hospital outbreak control measures, which is recommended if two or more nosocomial laboratory confirmed cases are diagnosed at the same ward within 72 h15,16. Two neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) may be used in the chemoprophylaxis in children: oral oseltamivir and inhaled zanamivir, which have been shown to be effective both in the treatment as well as in the prophylaxis of influenza17,18,19,20. NAIs show a 70–90% efficacy in influenza prevention, and the timing is crucial – NAIs are not recommended if the time since the first exposition to the influenza virus exceeds 48 h15. Oseltamivir use is recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) in children aged 3 months of age or more for prophylaxis and in critical situations for younger infants; zanamivir, on the other hand, is licensed in older children (5 years of age and above), which significantly restricts its use in clinical practice15.The safety profile of oseltamivir seems to be satisfactory; its use correlated in children with a higher risk of vomiting, without an increased risk of other adverse events (AE), including those observed in adult patients (nausea, renal events, and psychiatric effects)18. Irrespectively of the good safety profile, the shortest possible (and long enough to guarantee efficacy) exposition to the drug is the preferred approach, and the recommended duration of PEP varies between 7 to 10 days after the last known exposure15,19. The study by Ishiguro et al. (2016) analyzed the efficacy of a 3-day PEP course, showing high overall efficacy, comparable to that of longer (7–10-day) regimens (93%, with a 95% confidence interval: 53%–99%; p = 0.023)21. The study included several pediatric patients (the exact number has not been specified), and inspired us to perform such an analysis on the pediatric population21.In this randomized open-label trial, we aimed to compare the efficacy, safety, and costs of a 3- versus 7-day influenza prophylaxis with oral oseltamivir in hospitalized children.Material and methodsStudy design and settingThis prospective randomized open-label study is a pilot noninferiority investigation comparing the efficacy of shorter (3 days) and longer (7 days) influenza postexposure chemoprophylaxis with oseltamivir in a hospital setting. The trial was conducted at the Pediatric Ward of the Bielanski Hospital, Warsaw, Poland. Influenza contacts, i.e. children hospitalized due to other than influenza causes who had been contacted with influenza index case(s) during their hospitalization were eligible for the study. The trial was approved by the local Ethics Committee at The Centre of Postgraduate Medical Education (the permission number 77/PB/2016 issued on 16th November 2016). The trial was registered in the public clinical trial register at clinicaltrials.gov with the identifier NCT04297462. The study was registered after the patient enrolment had commenced, which was in accordance with the local legal regulations that permit the trial registration to be voluntary during the whole period of the patient’s enrolment if an appropriate Ethics Committee approval is granted.DefinitionsInfluenza index caseOnly patients with laboratory confirmed influenza were considered to be the index cases. Patients were tested towards influenza in the case of a clinical suspicion, i.e. the signs or symptoms of an influenza-like illness (ILI) or a presentation other than respiratory that could be attributable to an influenza infection (e.g., neurological manifestations, including febrile seizures)22. The presence of the virus was confimed in the patient’s nasopharyngeal swab with the use of the rapid influenza diagnostic test (RIDT) or the Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR); the latter one was considered conclusive in the case of any discrepancy. The following RIDTs were used: Nadal Influenza A + B cassette (nal von minden GmbH, Moers, Germany), BinaxNOW Influenza A&B Card (Alere Scarborough Inc., Scarborough, Maine, USA), BD DIRECTIGEN EZ FLU A + B (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Sparks, Maryland, USA), while RT-PCR was performed with a cartridge based nucleic acid amplification test Cepheid GeneXpert (Sunnyvale, California, USA). Each index case was given antiviral treatment at the time of the diagnosis in accordance with the CDC guidelines15.Influenza ContactEach patient hospitalized in the same room with an influenza index case was identified as influenza contact (the minimal duration of the contact was 8 h). Due to the different room capacities, cubatures, and varying number of persons per one room (between two to four patients and one or no parentutor per patient), alongside with the different patterns of the children’s behaviour, no distinction between direct (e.g. playing or speaking with the index case) and indirect contacts was made. This approach is in line with the study by Shinjoh et al. who included both the patients with direct contact and with close contact (admitted to the same room ass the index case)23. Due to the local legal regulations, no PEP could have been ordered directly by the pediatric ward’s staff to the parents or tutors present in the same room with the children, however, in each case of an influenza contact, a general practitioner’s visit was recommended, and an appropriate letter to the general practitioner was issued. In case any signs or symptoms should emerge, any symptomatic person (except for the patients) was asked to leave the hospital as soon as they noticed the first symptoms, and the child was then looked after by another parentutor or by the pediatric ward staff.Patients’ allocationA written informed consent of a parent/legal tutor and a patient (aged 16 years or more, according to the Polish law regulations) was obtained before the randomization. Once the consent was given, patients were randomized according to the previously generated table of randomization into the 3- or 7-day PEP group, the allocation ratio was 1:1 with block size ≤ 3. The table was generated using a table generator and sequentially numbered randomization results were opened at patient enrolment. The random allocation sequence was generated by A.W., while patient enrolment and allocation to the intervention group was performed by a local study team.Patients have their inherent right to discontinue the study participation at any moment. Enrolment was stopped when the calculated minimum number of patients was reached.Postexposure prophylaxis and follow-upAll the contacts were given oral oseltamivir in accordance with the local Polish recommendations for hospital prophylaxis, i.e. a single day dose of 30mg, 45mg, 60mg or 75mg in children aged 1 year old or more (weight range: up to 15kg; > 15–23kg; > 23- 40 kg, and > 40kg, respectively), or 3mg/kg/dose once a day in children aged 3–12 months old, 2.5mg/kg/dose in children aged 1–2 months, and 2mg/kg/dose in neonates) (10). Oseltamivir was given during hospitalization, and if the PEP duration exceeded the period of hospitalization, a continuation of the prophylaxis (up to 3 or 7 days, depending on the randomization result) was recommended. A follow-up lasted 7 days after the PEP had stopped: patients hospitalized during that period of time were examined daily, and if any signs or symptoms of a possible influenza were observed, an RT-PCR in a sample from a nasopharyngeal swab was performed immediately. Similarly, each discharged patient was asked to report immediately any signs or symptoms of influenza-like illness if they emerged during the PEP and within 7 days after the PEP had finished., and an RT-PCR was performed if patients presented with at least one of the symptoms: fever, cough, headache , muscle pain, general feeling of ill-health or sore throat. During the week following the end of the PEP, an additional passive inquiry was conducted regarding influenza signs and symptoms.Adverse events data collectionParentsutors/patients were asked to report any of the following adverse events (AE): nausea, vomiting, stomachache, headache, behavioral changes, including excitation and apathy, sleep disorders, skin hypersensitivity (including rash) in a prospective manner. After the discharge from the hospital, parentsutors were asked about the presence of the AEs mentioned above up to 7 days after finishing the PEP.OutcomesPrimary outcome measures included the PEP efficacy, safety (risk of adverse events in both groups), and the cumulative costs of drugs in each arm of the study, as well as the cost of the management of the adverse events related to the drug administration. In order to avoid the influence of the weight on the costs, we calculated the mean cost of the oseltamivir prophylactic dose, adding the cost of the appropriate 30 mg, 45 mg, 60 mg, and 75 mg doses (in the case of a dose lower than 30 mg, the cost of the 30 mg dose was used) and dividing it by the number of patients; then the mean cost was multiplied by the number of doses (3 or 7). The cost of the adverse events was estimated per AE episode: each AE episode was assumed to bring the risk of additional medical attendance, the official cost of an ambulatory visit for uninsured patients was used24. The costs were calculated and converted into EUR as of 31.12.202025.Secondary endpoints included the differences between 2 PEP regimens related to influenza complications: need for hospitalization in the case of a failed influenza chemoprophylaxis (i.e., if influenza was present within 7 days after the PEP completion), the duration of the influenza signs and symptoms, including fever after a failed chemoprophylaxis, the presence of complications in the case of a failed influenza chemoprophylaxis (pneumonia, bronchitis, otitis media, the need for antibiotic treatment, neurological sequelae, ICU transfer, death). The time-frame for secondary endpoints analysis was 28 days.Statistical analysisSample size calculation was based upon the assumption of a 99% efficacy according to the results from the previous study by Ishiguro21. A minimal sample size for the noninferiority of the 3 versus the 7-day PEP with a 90% power, α = 0.05 and a noninferiority border of 8 percentage points reached 27 patients per study arm. Two types of analysis were performed: intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP); for the ITT analysis, all patients originally enrolled in the trial were included; for the PP analysis, only patients who strictly adhered to the protocol were eligible.The data distribution was assessed with the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. Categorical data were presented as numbers (n) and frequency (%) and chi-square test was used for comparisons,while continuous data were presented, depending on the distribution, as a mean and a standard deviation (SD) or a median and an interquartile range (IQR) for normally or not-normally distributed variables, respectively. A corresponding parametric or non-parametric test was used for direct comparisons (the Student’s t-test or the Mann–Whitney U test). The z-test was used to assess the efficacy with 95% confidence intervals observed in the whole prophylactic group.. A difference between efficacy of the 3-day and 7-day PEP regimen (Δ) was estimated with the use of 1-sided 95% CI and the noninferiority of the 3-day regimen was recognized if the lower limit of Δ 95% CI did not exceed − 8 percentage points (p.p.). Since the advantages of the PEP seem to be unquestionable, we did not create a no-prophylaxis group, and used the results from the study by Ishiguro as a reference for no-prophylaxis group (there, 13.3% breakthrough influenza cases were reported without PEP)21. Relative risks of adverse events with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated. The ITT and PP populations were analyzed separately. The statistical significance was recognized for the p-value under 0.05. The statistical analysis was performed with the Statistica 13.1 software (TIBCO, Santa Clara, CA, USA, https://www.statsoft.pl/statistica_13/).Ethics approvalThis study was performed in line with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Approval was granted by the Ethics Committee of the Centre of Postgraduate Medical Education in Warsaw (the permission number 77/PB/2016 issued on 16th November 2016).Consent to participateInformed consent was obtained from legal guardians of all individual participants included in the study.ResultsStudy groupDuring the study period between December 2016 and February 2020, 60 patients were included and randomly allocated into the 3- or 7-day prophylaxis group (n = 29 or n = 31 patients, respectively).The final ITT group consisted of 59 patients (28 and 31, respectively) aged from 10 days to 16 years and 1 month (median 23 months), one patient was excluded due to the discharge on parental request and lack of follow-up data (Fig. 1).Figure 1A flowchart of the patients in the study (abbreviations: n- number of patients, mo- months old, PEP- postexposure prophylaxis, ITT- intention-to-treat, PP- per-protocol).Full size imageThere were 3 cases of a withdrawal, one took place in the 3-day group (1-month old infant on the 2nd day) and two cases in the 7-day group (a 21-month old patient on the 4th day of the PEP, and a 56-month old patient on the 3rd day of the regimen). They were related to a poor drug tolerance: multiple adverse events (vomiting, sleep/behavioural changes, skin disorder) reported by the parents in an infant from the 3-day group and vomiting in patients from the 7-day group; the difference in withdrawal rate remained statistically insignificant (p = 0.62). The final PP group included 56 patients (27 and 29 in the 3- and 7-day prophylaxis arm, respectively).The study groups differed in terms of the median age both in the ITT group (14.5 in the 3-day group vs. 26.5 months in the 7-day group, p = 0.02) and the PP group (14.6 vs. 26.5, respectively, p = 0.036); as consequence, there were differences in body weight, but not in oseltamivir dose per body weight (Table 1).Table 1 Baseline characteristics of the study groups (3-day vs. 7-day group). Abbreviations: ITT- intention-to-treat, PP- per-protocol, PEP- postexposure prophylaxis, n- number of patients, IQR- interquartile range, N/A—not applicable.Full size tableEpidemiological dataThe patients in the ITT group had contact with influenza A in 35 cases (19 cases in the 3-day and 16 in the 7-day group), with influenza B in 22 cases (9 and 13 cases in respective groups), and with both A and B types in 2 cases from the 7-day group. The PP group patients had contact with influenza A in 32 cases (18 and 14 cases, respectively), with influenza B in 22 cases, and with influenza A and B types in 2 cases. None of the patients had previously been vaccinated against influenza, neither had any of the mothers been immunized against flu during pregnancy.Efficacy of postexposure prophylaxisTwo patients developed respiratory tract infections due to laboratory-confirmed influenza type A (n = 1) and type B (n = 1). No failures of the PEP were observed in the 3-day group, while both failures took place in the 7-day group (influenza type A on 4th day of prophylaxis, and influenza type B on 6th day of prophylaxis).The general PEP efficacy in the ITT analysis reached 96.6% (95% CI 88.3% to 99.6%) (57/59), while in the PP analysis it was 96.4% (95% CI 87.6% to 99.6%) (54/56) (Table 2). Since low influenza incidence was observed in both the 3-day and 7-day groups, a comparison with the assumed efficacy of no PEP (86.7% according to the literature) showed a statistically significant advantage of PEP over no prophylaxis with a z-score of 2.24 (p = 0.025) in the ITT analysis and 2.2 (p = 0.033) in the PP analysis.Table 2 A summary of efficacy and safety of influenza postexposure prophylaxis and a comparison of the study groups (3-day vs. 7-day group) in the intention-to-treat and per-protocol analysis. The relative risk represents the risk between the 3-day and the 7day PEP group. Abbreviations: ITT- intention-to-treat, PP- per-protocol PEP- postexposure prophylaxis, 95% CI- 95-percent confidence interval, n- number of patients, IQR- interquartile range.Full size tableThe efficacy ob both the 3-day and 7-day PEP was high in the ITT analysis, reaching 100% (95% CI 87.7–100%) and 93.6% (95% CI 78.6–99.2%), respectively, while in the PP analysis the efficacy was similarly high with 100% (95% CI 87.2–100%) and 93.1% (95% CI 77.2–99.2%) in the 3-day and 7-day PEP groups, respectively. The difference between the 2 PEP regimens, however, remained statistically insignificant in both ITT and PP analyses.The ITT group difference between the efficacy of the 3-day and 7-day regimens (100% and 93.55%, respectively) equalled 6.45 p.p. with 1-sided 95% CI reaching (− 2.8, − 1.31). The difference in the PP analysis was Δ = 6.9 p.p. (100% vs. 93.1%, respectively), and 1-sided 95% CI equalled (− 2.83, − 1.27). The noninferiority of the 3-day regimen was assumed for Δ not lower than − 8 p.p. and both ITT and PP analyses confirmed the assumed noninferiority of the 3-day PEP.Since breakthrough influenza was present only in the 7-day group, no further analysis comparing the influenza-related secondary end-points (i.e., need for hospitalization, duration of signs/symptoms, presence of complications) was conducted.Safety profile and costs of postexposure prophylaxisAdverse events possibly related to the drug administration were reported in 21 patients (8 in the 3-day group and 13 in the 7-day group) in the ITT analysis and in 18 patients in the PP analysis (7 and 11 patients, respectively) (Table 2).The most common adverse event was vomiting reported in 12 cases (3 and 9 cases in the 3-day and 7-day groups, respectively) in the ITT group, and 9 cases (2 and 7 cases, respectively) in the PP group, followed by behavioural changes in 6 (ITT) and 5 patients (PP), and stomachache (n = 4), skin disorders (n = 4 for ITTand n = 3 for PP, and sleep disorders.Multiple adverse events, i.e. affecting more than one system, were observed in 5 children in the ITT and in 4 cases in the PP analysis.The relative risk of adverse events, or multiple AEs did not differ significantly between the groups (in the ITT analysis or in the PP analysis).The cumulative costs of the prophylaxis and adverse events management were significantly lower in the 3-day group than in the 7-day group both in the ITT and PP analysis (median 4.5 euro, IQR: 4.5–15.1 versus 10.5 euro, IQR: 10.5–21.1, p < 0.01, respectively).DiscussionThis randomized controlled trial showed that the 3-day regimen of postexposure influenza chemoprophylaxis with oseltamivir is not less efficacious than the 7-day prophylaxis in children hospitalized at the pediatric ward, and decreases the costs of the chemoprophylaxis.High efficacy of the shorter PEP duration observed in our trial is in line with the results reported by Ishiguro et al. (2016), who showed that a shorter (3-day) PEP may be as effective as the 7 or 10-day regimen21. The study included 212 hospitalized patients who had contact with the influenza index cases during their hospitalization; the trial revealed a 93% efficacy when compared to no PEP (95% confidence interval: 53– 99%; p = 0.023)21. Although the majority of patients were adults, there was a pediatric subgroup (the exact number of children was not specified), which opened the discussion on a possibility of shortening the PEP in children, as well21. Similarly, the recent randomized trial from Slovenia aimed to verify the possibility of a shorter PEP regimen by allocating 222 adult patients into 5- or 10-day PEP group; the study confirmed high PEP efficacy with a noninferiority of a shorter PEP course compared to the longer one26. There have been no controlled studies which would directly compare differences in hospitalized pediatric population, although a protocol for a prospective, multi-center, single-arm trial has been published and to the best of our knowledge the study is being conducted27.It needs to be emphasized, that PEP efficacy may depend on the study setting and the question of the difference between a household and a nosocomial contact needs to be recognised. Nevertheless, very high efficacy observed in our study is in line with the corresponding studies set in a hospital environment (97% in the study by Shinjoh, 99% in the study by Ishiguro, and 99% in the study by Lepen) and is generally higher than those observed in household settings21,23,26. It may be attributed to various factors, including patient’s better compliance, the duration of contact (which may be ceased with a transfer to another room or discharge from the hospital, which is not a routine procedure in the majotiry of household contacts), and the contact quality – contact among patients differs substantially from household contact. In our study, due to the high bed occupancy during the influenza season, transferring the index cases immediately after the diagnosis of influenza was not possible, similarly, transferring the patients who have had contact and are possibly shedding the virus is not a routine, rather, the method of choice is the cohortation of patients. All efforts to limit the duration of contact are being made at our ward, and patients newly diagnosed with influenza are transferred to other patient rooms, depending on the room availability. Nevertheless, no analysis on the correlation with the contact duration has been made, since the incubation period varies hugely among the patients and the first day of the reported syndromes is not the first day of the infectiousness; also shedding in children is more heterogeneous than in adults, and it may also last longer due to a slower decline rate28. A study by Lau (2010) proved influenza A shedding a day before the acute respiratory infection onset and 1–2 days in the case of influenza B, thus, in accordance with Ishiguro et al. , we had assumed that calculating true duration of exposition to the influenza virus may be seriously misleading21,29In our series of patients, two failures in the prophylaxis took place in the 7-day regimen group, with no failures in the 3-day group; however, it may be attributed only to the randomization, not the duration of the PEP itself. One patient had contact and was infected with influenza type A, and the other one with type B, while the PEP failures observed in the study by Shinjoh et al. , the only fully pediatric study, were seen in two patients who had contact with influenza type B23. It should thus be remembered that both influenza A and B need to be considered a significant threat30,31.A crucial factor for PEP efficacy seems to be appropriate timing. Its significance is reflected universally in the recommendations on the PEP, which is not advised if more than 48 h have passed since the first exposition to the index case32. The PEP failures in the study by Shinjoh et al. developed in patients who were given oseltamivir more than 24 h after the contact, while in our study each patient was given oseltamivir within 12 h after the first contact had been recognized, thus, the PEP failures cannot be attributed to a delay in the PEP23.The patients’ vaccination status did not influence the effects of the PEP in our group either; none of the contacts had ever been vaccinated against influenza, neither were the mothers of infants vaccinated during the pregnancy. A problem of the low influenza vaccine uptake (approximately 2.6% in the general population, and 0.85% in children under 14 years of age) is a huge public health concern in Poland, alike in other countries33,34.,The most frequent oseltamivir adverse event (AE) observed in this study was nausea/vomiting; metaanalyses on the NAIs use had previously reported vomiting as the only statistically significant AE related to the use of oseltamivir20,35. Interestingly, the frequency of nasusea and vomiting increased with the number of doses in adult patients36. In our patients, more cases of vomiting were observed in the 7-day group, although the relative risk was insignificant, alike other adverse events relative risks. Although the lack of statistical significance needs to be verified in a broader group of patients (the group size is relatively small), the tendency towards a higher frequency of AEs in the 7-day PEP group observed in our study may possibly be explained by the duration of the PEP, which increases the total number of doses. The withdrawal due to AEs was scarce and reached 5.1%; it took place in patients assigned to both the 3- and 7-day groups (on 2nd, 3rd and 4th day of prophylaxis), and no cases of influenza were reported. In the previous studies on oseltamivir treatment (where the dose was twofold higher than in the case of PEP), the withdrawal from treatment, as well as withdrawal due to AEs, was statistically insignificant as compared to placebo20.Decreasing the exposition of patients to the drug is crucial in order to reduce the risk of adverse events, and, even more importantly, to minimize the risk of a drug resistance development. Although, according to the CDC data, a resistance to NAIs is relatively uncommon, it remains a possible threat to the public health, and drug resistance cases have been described in young children32,37. The patients who developed influenza during oseltamivir prophylaxis in our study were then successfully treated with oseltamivir, and the dose effect might be a possible explanation, since prophylaxis means administering half of the actual treatment dose.There are also certain limitations to this study. First, the number of patients enrolled was relatively small, nevertheless, this is a pilot study and brings important data, especially considering the scarce pediatric studies in this area. The recommended minimal sample size for a two-arm pilot trial varies between 24 and 70, depending on the sources , and the majority of authors suggests the number of up to 5538,39,40. Second, this is only a single-centre study, and broader multi-centre analyses are required. Third, the patients (and caregivers) were not blinded and an open model of the study might result in a possible bias, but patients underwent everyday examination during the hospitalization, and after a hospital discharge in the follow-up period caregivers were directly asked about any symptoms in their children. Also, we did not analyse the various exposition patterns, including the patients’ hygienic or social behaviour during the hospitalization, yet, due to other differences (e.g., the varying infectiousness of the influenza strains, the correlation with the number of virus copies). We did not analysed visitors as potential source of influenza, although due to epidemiological concerns during high respiratory infections seasons, the number of visitors is limited to one single person taking care of a child. No in-depth analysis on influenza type or subtype/lineage was performed due to the small number of patients, yet only extremely large trials could answer this question.In conclusion, this study shows noninferiority of 3-day postexposure prophylaxis with oseltamivir compared to 7-day PEP with high efficacy of both regimens investigated. Certainly, as a pilot study, this thesis needs further verification in large numbers of patients enrolled in multi-site trials. Further studies will need to confirm the efficacy of a shorter PEP regimen, establish its benefits, including cost-effectiveness, and probably verify an optimal duration of PEP. However, based on the promising efficacy and safety profile, a shorter course of postexposure prophylaxis may help to achieve better drug tolerability and reduce the risk of developing drug resistance.

David Topham, PhD, a professor of Microbiology and Immunology and director of the University of Rochester Translational Immunology and Infectious Disease Institute, has been studying the H5N1 and other influenza viruses for 27 years. What is bird flu, and when did bird flu in cattle start? Topham: The H5N1 virus has been in North America for quite a long time in both wild birds and domestic poultry. A few years ago, a large outbreak in chickens and turkeys prompted farms to cull their entire flocks. Bird flu has been circulating in dairy cattle for at least five to six months and probably longer, but we don't know exactly when or where it jumped over. We assume it’s a respiratory infection in cattle, and it also looks like the udders are infected because we’re finding a lot of virus in milk. There are also reports of infections in cats, which is concerning because they’re biologically closer to humans than cattle are.The recent cases in humans have been dairy workers in a handful of states (not New York) who have close contact with the cattle. This is similar to what we’ve experienced since 1997, when H5N1 first emerged, and the people infected were either working with infected poultry or taking care of severely ill family members. So, transmission of H5N1 in humans so far resulted from very intense contact, as opposed to casually spreading. The virus has been found in milk—should people worry about the food supply? Topham: Viral particles have been detected in the milk supply, but people should rest assured that pasteurization kills microorganisms, including the H5N1 virus. A lot of people feel that drinking raw milk is healthier than pasteurized milk and I respect that. But when there's potentially a pathogen floating around in that milk, that changes the equation, and I would recommend avoiding raw milk at present. Are there any precautions people can take to limit risk? Topham: Get vaccinated. Flu vaccines aren't perfect, but even a badly matched vaccine is better than no vaccine and will offer a degree of protection. It won't necessarily keep you from getting infected, but people that have more immunity tend to experience less-severe symptoms. What are the warning signs that H5N1 is becoming a danger to human health? Topham: Anytime these viruses start to pop up in environments where lots of people are present and there are signs of infection, that's a concern. Because the more often that happens, the more likely that two viruses, such as the human influenza virus and the avian H5N1 virus, will mix and a new virus can emerge. This is just like reshuffling a deck of cards, and if the virus gets a better hand maybe it acquires the ability to spread from person to person via the respiratory route, and that would be really bad. This mixing event is the biggest concern and a major red line, because that’s historically how pandemic influenza has emerged. How prepared is the medical community if H5N1 becomes more infectious to humans? Topham: The good news is that we already have an H5N1 vaccine stockpile. We've developed vaccines against this strain that may not be a perfect match but will be close enough. In fact, the government has ordered manufacturers to begin increasing the stockpiles. So if the virus were to emerge, we could scale up very quickly and we would rapidly begin vaccinating people. The COVID pandemic has accelerated the process of vaccine development, testing, and manufacturing and we are able to quickly ramp up the production even against newly emerged variants. We can do it in months instead of years. Tamiflu and the other antivirals against influenza look like they're effective against this virus.

On June 13, 2024, the Centers for Disease Control announced that 48 states and 50 jurisdictions have been impacted by the current outbreak of avian influenza (H5N1), widely known as bird flu. This highly contagious viral disease poses a severe threat to poultry and dairy farms, with potentially devastating impacts on people, animals, and businesses. While avian influenza is not a new issue for the poultry sector, recent outbreaks have intensified concerns due to the virus's virulence and rapid spread among bird populations. Alarmingly, recent interspecies H5N1 cases have also been identified in more than 90 dairy herds and have infected humans, with one instance recently resulting in a fatality. The consequences of an outbreak can be catastrophic, leading to mass culling of birds, substantial economic losses for farmers, disruption of supply chains, and public health risks. The current avian influenza outbreak presents a significant opportunity for TOMI to support its partners in mitigating risks and ensuring operational continuity. By providing advanced disinfection solutions, TOMI is positioned to not only assist in controlling the spread of bird flu but also to explore potential avenues for strategic growth. The Company’s ongoing efforts in innovation and strategic partnerships are critical in addressing this global challenge and positioning TOMI for sustained growth in the food safety and agricultural sectors. In response to this looming threat, industry stakeholders are increasingly adopting advanced disinfection technologies such as SteraMist to protect their facilities and control the spread of this lethal virus. The primary challenges during an avian influenza outbreak are the rapid transmission of the virus and its resilience in the environment. Contaminated environments and surfaces, close contact, and inhaling the virus from droplets or dust in the air can serve as reservoirs, facilitating its spread among birds. As the industry braces for outbreaks, being prepared by implementing stringent biosecurity measures and cutting-edge disinfection methods is crucial to safeguarding animal health and ensuring business continuity. TOMI is readily equipped to deploy SteraMist to confront this looming threat and countless others spreading worldwide. We are leveraging our long-term, established partnerships to navigate this challenge and drive company growth. Our strategy of developing a global distribution network aligns precisely with the global nature of this threat. By working closely with our customers and distributors, we are not only reducing the threat of avian influenza but also capitalizing on the opportunity to expand our market reach and enhance our service offerings.” Dr. Halden Shane, CEO of TOMI Source:TOMI Environmental Solutions Posted in: Disease/Infection News Tags: Avian Influenza, Biosecurity, Bird Flu, Braces, Decontamination, Disinfection, Flu, Food, Food Safety, H5N1, Influenza, Public Health, Technology, Viral Disease, Virus Comments (0) Download PDF Copy Suggested Reading Seasonal influenza adapted and evolved during the COVID-19 pandemicH5N1 bird flu is mutating fast and jumping to mammals - could the next pandemic be here?Exclusive: Emails reveal how health departments struggle to track human cases of bird fluResearch identifies respiratory transmission potential of H5N1 virusPasteurization effectively reduces H5N1 virus in milk but further testing is essentialStudy reveals how COVID-19 affected the spread and evolution of seasonal influenzaStudy confirms flu vaccine effectiveness against A H1N1 in young childrenGlobal experts gather in Brisbane for scientific meeting dedicated to influenza Comments The opinions expressed here are the views of the writer and do not necessarily reflect the views and opinions of News Medical.

This study aims to investigate the genotypic distribution and pathogenic characteristics of H9N2 isolates from wild birds and domestic poultry in Yunnan Province, China. Methods: Eleven H9N2 strains were isolated from fecal samples of overwintering wild birds and proximate domestic poultry in Yunnan, including four from common cranes (Grus grus), two from bar-headed geese (Anser indicus), and five from domestic poultry (Gallus gallus). Phylogenetic analysis was conducted to determine the genotypes, and representative strains were inoculated into Yunnan mallard ducks to assess pathogenicity. Results: Phylogenetic analysis revealed that five isolates from domestic birds and one from a bar-headed goose belong to genotype S, while the remaining five isolates from wild birds belong to genotype A. These bird-derived strains possess deletions in the stalk domain of NA protein and the N166D mutation of HA protein, typical of poultry strains. Genotype S H9N2 demonstrated oropharyngeal shedding, while genotype A H9N2 exhibited cloacal shedding and high viral loads in the duodenum. Both strains caused significant pathological injuries, with genotype S inducing more severe damage to the thymus and spleen, while genotype A caused duodenal muscle layer rupture. Discussion: These findings suggest that at least two genotypes of H9N2 are currently circulating in Yunnan, and Yunnan mallard ducks potentially act as intermediaries in interspecies transmission. These insights highlight the importance of analyzing the current epidemiological transmission characteristics of H9N2 among wild and domestic birds in China. 1 Introduction H9N2 subtype avian influenza virus (AIV) was firstly isolated from turkey flocks in Wisconsin, USA, in 1966 (Aurkey/Wisconsin/1/1966(H9N2)) (Homme and Easterday, 1970). It spread extensively during the 1990′s, leading to continuous circulation among domestic chickens in various countries across Asia, the Middle East, and North Africa (Gu et al., 2017). The prevalence of the H9N2 AIV has been found to be extremely high, exceeding 10% in China, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Egypt according to recent surveys conducted in live bird markets (LBMs) (Turner et al., 2017; Chaudhry et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2018; Peacock et al., 2019). Due to repeated reinfections of the same birds, particularly in longer-lived layers and breeders, as well as silent spread between farms and smallholdings, H9N2 AIV has been considered as a predominant subtype of AIVs circulating in poultry (Teng et al., 2016). H9N2 AIV has undergone continuous evolution resulting in its classification into at least 23 genotypes (A-W) based on the eight gene segments (Gu et al., 2017). Notably, genotypes A, H, and S have been continued to circulate wildly in Chinese poultry. The genotype A, originating from BJ/94-like strains (represented by A/chicken/Beijing/1/1994), dominated the chicken populations in the 1990s (Liu et al., 2003); Early in the 21st century, genotype H emerged, characterized by the a gene constellation of hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA), matrix (M), and non-structural protein (NS) genes from the genotype A and polymerase basic 2 (PB2), polymerase basic 1 (PB1), polymerase acidic (PA), and nucleoprotein (NP) genes from the F/98-like lineage (represented by A/chicken/Shanghai/F/1998), and became prevalent in poultry (Zhang et al., 2008). By 2007, the PB2 and M genes of the genotype H were replaced by those from the G1-like lineage (presented by A/quail/Hong Kong/G1/1997), forming the genotype S, which has predominated since 2010 (Liu et al., 2016). H9N2 has been detected in various bird species, including chickens, ducks, quails, pheasants, partridges, guinea fowl, pigeons, green peafowl, as well as wild birds (Guo et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2023). Wild aquatic birds, with their gastrointestinal viral tropism and cloacal route of viral shedding, are considered as the primary natural reservoir for AIV (Homme and Easterday, 1970; Yang et al., 2022). Billions of poultry birds are raised in China every year under the traditional small-scale and backyard-level raising model with limited biosecurity measures (Liu et al., 2020; Xue et al., 2023). As a result, domestic waterfowls, such as ducks and goose, can directly contact with wild birds through shared aquatic habitats contaminated by virus shedding (Liu et al., 2020; Xue et al., 2023). This facilitates the fecal-oral transmission of AIVs between domestic and wild birds. Domestic ducks in China, which often show few or no disease signs after viral infection and demonstrate surreptitious spread of viruses, are considered the “Trojan horses” of AIV transmission (Kim et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2023). Actively monitoring the prevalence and evolution of influenza viruses will contribute to the development of prevention and control measures against the influenza epidemic. In this study, 11 isolates of H9N2 were identified in our annual surveillance for AIV in Dashanbao Black-Necked Crane National Nature Reserve and Huize Black-Necked Crane National Reserve, in Yunnan Province, China, from the fecal samples of wild birds and surrounding domestic poultry during 2021–2022 (Yang et al., 2022). The viral phylogenetic analysis revealed distinct genotypes between strains obtained from wild birds and domestic birds. The representative strains from the two genotypes exhibited varying levels of pathogenicity on the challenged mallard ducks. These results may contribute to our analysis of the current epidemiological transmission characteristics of H9N2 among wild and domestic birds in China. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 H9N2 isolates In this study, 11 H9N2 AIV isolates were analyzed, including four from common crane (Grus grus), two from bar-headed goose (Anser indicus) and five from domestic poultry (Gallus gallus). These isolates had been previously identified during our AIV surveillance at the Dashanbao Black-Necked Crane National Nature Reserve and the Huize Black-Necked Crane National Reserve, in Yunnan Province, China (Yang et al., 2022). The identification procedures for the H9N2 AIV isolates were as follows: initially, fresh samples were propagated in chicken embryos, and the allantoic fluid was tested using the hemagglutination assay. Subsequently, viral RNA extracted from hemagglutination-positive allantoic fluid was used to identify AIV-positive samples through reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplification of the M gene, using specific primers (AIF: 5′-CACCATGAGTCTTCTAACCGAG-3′, AIR: 5′-CTACTGTTGTATATGAGACCC-3′). Finally, the identified AIV strains were subtyped using H9-specific primers (H9F: 5′-CTYCACACAGARCACAATGG-3′ and H9R: 5′-GTCACACTTGTTGTTGTRTC-3′), in conjunction with N2-specific primers (N2F: 5′-AACACIGACTGGAGTGGYTAC-3′ and N2R: 5′-GGAATTCTGTRCTGGAACAC-3′) (Lee et al., 2001; Fereidouni et al., 2009). Detailed information regarding strain names, abbreviations, host species, and accession numbers in database were cataloged in Table 1. Table 1 Table 1. Detailed information of 11 H9N2 isolates identified in this study. 2.2 Next generation sequencing The complete genomes of the 11 H9N2 isolates were amplified across all eight segments utilizing a one-step RT-PCR protocol with the reported primers MBTuni-12 (5′-ACGCGTGATCAGCAAAAGCAGG-3′) and MBTuni-13 (5′-ACGCGTGATCAGTAGAAACAAGG-3′) (Zhou et al., 2009). Subsequent next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the amplified products was performed on an Illumina MiSeq platform (Illumina, CA, USA). Library preparation for sequencing was conducted using the Nextera XT Library Prep Kit (Illumina, CA, USA), in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Quality filtering of raw sequence data was conducted using Fastx Toolkit version 0.0.13 (http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/index.html), discarding reads shorter than 20 base pairs and those containing ambiguous identities to produce clean reads. These quality-filtered clean reads were then assembled de novo using the CLC Genomics Workbench software version 6.0.4 (Qiagen Inc., MD, USA). The resulting single-gene assemblies were further refined with the CAP3 sequence assembly program (NCI, MD, USA). Assembled consensus sequences were analyzed against the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) non-redundant protein database using BLASTX with a threshold E-value of < 10−5 to identify significant alignments. 2.3 Phylogenetic analysis The sequences of representative isolates from the reported Eurasian lineage, along with those closely related to the isolates examined in this study, were retrieved from the NCBI GenBank and Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) EpiFlu databases, as detailed in Supplementary Table S1. These sequences were aligned using the online MAFFT service (Multiple Alignment using Fast Fourier Transform, https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software). Subsequently, maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic trees for each of the 11 AIV segments were constructed based on these alignments employing IQ-TREE software version 2.3.1 (UNIVIE, Vienna, Austria). The optimal substitution models were identified as GTR+F+G4 for PB2, PB1, PA, and NP segments; GTR+F+R2 for HA; GTR+F+I+G4 for NA; TVM+F+I+G4 for M; and TVM+F+G4 for NS segments. To evaluate the robustness of the phylogenetic trees, bootstrap resampling was conducted with 1,000 replicates. The finalized phylogenetic trees were then visualized and annotated utilizing FigTree version 1.4.4 (Edin., Edinburgh, UK). 2.4 Viral challenge with Yunnan mallard duck Isolates CC-3 belonging to genotype A and CK-74 belonging to genotype S were designated for the experimental animal infection study, based on their high viral titers as determined by the 50% egg infectious dose (EID50). The Yunnan mallard duck, a local breed raised in backyard farms across the countryside of Yunnan Province, China, was designated as the challenging animal. One-week-old mallard ducks, sourced from a commercial duck farm where routine immunization against H9N2 was not practiced, were individually identified with numbered anklets and randomly assigned to three groups of eight: the genotype A inoculation group (treated with CC-3), the genotype S inoculation group (treated with CK-74), and the control group. The inoculation groups administered a 0.1 mL intranasal dose of allantoic fluid with an EID50 of 106.0 per 0.2 mL, from either CC-3 or CK-74 strains. The control group received an equivalent volume of virus-free allantoic fluid. All groups had access to water and feed ad libitum during the study. Prior to viral infection, oropharyngeal (OP) and cloacal (CL) swab samples were collected from each duck for M gene RT-PCR amplification. Only ducks that tested negative for AIV were included in the animal challenge experiment. Over a 14-day observation period, the ducks were monitored daily for clinical signs, with body weight measured before feeding. OP and CL swabs were collected in 1 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 1, 3, 4, 7, 10 and 14 days post inoculation (dpi) to assess viral shedding. On 4 and 14 dpi, four ducks from each group were euthanized and necropsied to examine for gross lesions. Portions of tissues from the thymus, trachea, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, duodenum, and heart were collected and frozen for histopathologic examination and viral load quantification. 2.5 Quantification of viral loads To assess the viral shedding and replication of CC-3 and CK-74 strains in Yunnan mallard ducks, quantitative analyses were conducted on specimens obtained from OP and CL swabs, as well as tissue samples. Tissue specimens were homogenized in PBS to achieve a 10% weight/volume (W/V) ratio. The homogenates and swab suspensions were centrifuged at 3,500 rpm for 5 min, and 0.2 mL of the resulting supernatant was utilized for RNA extraction, followed by real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR). The rRT-PCR assay targeted the influenza virus M gene and was performed using the TaKaRa One Step PrimeScript™ III RT-qPCR Mix with UNG kit (TaKaRa, Kusatsu, Japan) on an ABI 7500 Fast real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA). The primer-probe set consisted of forward primer M-F (5′-CGTCAACTTCAAGTACTC-3′), reverse primer M-R (5′-AGAGGATGCTCATGTTAC-3′), and a TaqMan probe (5′-FAM-CCTACTCAGATGGAGGCTTCTACC-TAMRA-3′). For quantification, the levels of viral RNA were expressed as equivalents of EID50 (eqEID50), as employed in previous studies (Swietoń et al., 2020; Kye et al., 2021). Standards with known tenfold dilution viral titers ranging from 106.0 to 100.0 EID50 per 0.2 mL in egg allantoic fluid for each virus strain were prepared. Viral RNA extracted from these standards was quantified M gene by rRT-PCR in parallel with the experimental samples. The correlations between cycle threshold (Ct) values and viral titers expressed as log10 EID50 were established from these standards. The conversion of the sample Ct values using these correlations resulted in eqEID50. 2.6 Histopathological examination Tissue specimens were fixed in a 4% paraformaldehyde solution, dehydrate using graded ethanol, vitrified by dimethylbenzene and subsequently embedded in paraffin. These paraffin-embedded tissue blocks were then sectioned into 5 μm slices. Following dewaxing and rehydration, the sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE). Microscopic lesions in the tissues were observed using an Olympus CX31 microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) and documented with a CCD imaging system (Motic, Fujian, China). 2.7 Statistical analysis Two-way ANOVA was applied to examine variations in viral loads among OP, CL, and tissues samples between the two genotype viruses, employing GraphPad Prism software version 9.5.0 (GraphPad, CA, USA). A significance level p < 0.05 was adopted. 2.8 Ethics statement The study involving animals received approval from the Academic Committee of Southwest Forestry University. The protocol was designated as SWFU-2022021, with approval granted on November 2, 2022. 3 Results 3.1 Phylogenetic characterization The complete sequences for all eight gene segments of the 11 isolates were obtained, except for the HA and M segments of BHG-21, and the M segment of CC-6, which were not assembled into complete sequences by NGS. The identified sequences were submitted to the GISAID EpiFlu database (Table 1). BLAST comparisons revealed that the gene sequences of five H9N2 isolates derived from domestic poultry, along with one strain from a bar-headed goose in Huize, displayed a remarkably high similarity to H9N2 strains identified in Chinese poultry from 2015 to 2022, with similarities ranging from 95.84% to 99.60% (Supplementary Table S2). In a similar vein, with the exception of the PA gene, the remaining seven gene sequences of the five H9N2 isolates sourced from wild birds were found to be homologous to strains isolated from domestic poultry in China between 1999 and 2012, with similarity spanning from 93.53% to 99.86%. Notably, the PA segments of these H9N2 AIVs shared close genetic relatedness with the corresponding segment of the precursor strain A/great bustard/Inner Mongolia/IM-E2/2012(H9N2), as similarities ranged between 98.84% and 99.16%. The detailed sequence homology analysis of the isolates is provided in Supplementary Table S2. The ML tree of the HA gene revealed that all the H9N2 isolates clustered in the same branch with the common ancestry A/Chicken/Beijing/1/94(H9N2), designated as BJ/94-like lineage or h9.4.2 lineage (Jiang et al., 2012). The h9.4.2 lineage had been further subdivided into h9.4.2.1–h9.4.2.6 (Jiang et al., 2012). The strains identified in this study were classified into two distinct sub-branches: those derived from wild birds under sub-lineage h9.4.2.4, represented by A/chicken/Guangxi/55/2005(H9N2), and those from domestic birds associated with sub-lineage h9.4.2.5, represented by A/chicken/Guangxi/10/99(H9N2) (Figure 1). Figure 1 Figure 1. Phylogenetic analysis of the HA gene from H9N2 AIV. The phylogenetic tree is generated with IQ-TREE software employing the maximum likelihood (ML) method. Node support is evaluated through 1,000 bootstrap replicates, and support values exceeding 70% are indicated at the corresponding nodes. The 11 H9N2 strains sequenced in this study are denoted by red triangles, while reference sequences for each clade are emphasized in bold. Branch-specific nomenclature is detailed to the right of the tree. The remaining seven gene segments from five wild bird-origin the H9N2 isolates were also classified within the BJ/94-like lineage (Figure 2, Supplementary Figure S1), suggesting that these isolates exhibit characteristics of genotype A, a prevalent genotype of H9N2 in Chinese domestic poultry prior to 1998. The five H9N2 isolates from domestic birds and one from a bar-headed goose (abbreviated as BHG-8) identified in this study displayed the same gene reassortment pattern. Specifically, the HA, NA and NS segments were derived from BJ/94-like lineage, PB2 and M from G1-like lineage, and PB1, PA and NP segments from F/98-like lineage (Figure 2, Supplementary Figure S1). This pattern typifies the genotype S H9N2, which has been prevalent in poultry populations since 2010. Figure 2 Figure 2. Genetic diversity of the 11 H9N2 AIV isolated in Yunnan Province, China. Four H9N2 strains isolated from common crane (CC-3, CC-6, CC-7 and CC-11) and one from bar-headed goose (BHG-21) are classified as genotype A, having acquired all eight gene segments from the BJ/94-like lineage. Conversely, five stains from chickens (CK-54, CK-59, CK-68, CK-74 and CK-75) and the one other strain from a bar-headed goose (BHG-8) are categorized as genotype S, representing a triple- reassortment derived from the BJ/94-like, G1-like, and F/98-like lineages. In the depiction, ellipses represent the AIV strains, with each of the eight horizontal segments corresponding to a distinct viral gene: polymerase basic protein 2 (PB2), polymerase basic protein 1 (PB1), polymerase acidic (PA), hemagglutinin (HA), nucleoprotein (NP), neuraminidase (NA), matrix proteins (M), and non-structural proteins (NS), respectively. Each color signifies a specific viral lineage, with BJ/94-like in blue, G1-like in green, and F/98-like in red. 3.2 Key amino acid characterization Amino acid site analysis revealed that all the isolates in this study lacked multiple consecutive basic amino acids at the HA protein cleavage site, indicating characteristics associated with low pathogenic AIV (LPAIV). Specifically, the cleavage site sequences 333PSRSSR↓GLF341 of the HA protein matched the defining feature observed in the predominant H9N2 strains circulating in China since 2013 (Heo et al., 2021). This consistent sequence pattern was observed across all genotype S isolates in this study (Table 2). Table 2 Table 2. Characterization of the key amino acid sites for the H9N2 AIV isolates in this study. Further analysis focused on four key amino acid sites—226, 227, 153, and 166—of the HA protein. Mutations of Q226L and Q227M (H3 numbering) were associated with altering the binding preference of HA protein to the receptors from different host species, thus facilitating interspecies transmission (Sun et al., 2021). Mutations D153N and N166D were found to enhance viral immune evasion capabilities, with the N166D mutation, commonly found in vaccinated domestic poultry, weakening the antibody response in avian species (Kandeil et al., 2017; Jin et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2023). Wild bird-derived isolates belonging to genotype A typically exhibited one or two of these mutations, whereas poultry-derived isolates belonging to genotype S contained three or four mutations (Table 2). Additionally, the five wild bird-derived isolates belonging to genotype A were also found to have the deletions at positions 63–65 in the stalk region of NA protein, representing an adaptation feature for the AIVs to domestic poultry (Lv et al., 2015; Peacock et al., 2019). Isolates of genotype S originating from domestic bird demonstrated additional mutations in the polymerase proteins and NP, specifically I292V in the PB2, K356R in PA and I353V in NP (Table 2). Conversely, isolates derived from wild birds did not manifest these mutations. These genetic alterations may potentially augment viral replication efficiency within host cells by increasing polymerase activity, consequently contributing to increased virulence (Naffakh et al., 2008; Xu et al., 2016; Guo et al., 2022). 3.3 Body weight changes None of the experimental groups reported any mortality. In the genotype S inoculation group treated with CK-74 strain, some ducks exhibited symptoms, such as coughing, mild depression, and reduced feed intake during the initial 3 dpi. In the genotype A inoculation group treated with CC-3, reduced feed intake was observed, with some ducks experiencing diarrhea starting at 4 dpi and returning to normal activity levels by 7 dpi. Over the course of the 14-day observation period following the animal challenge experiment, ducks inoculated with H9N2 strains exhibited suppressed body weight gain in comparison to the control group (Figure 3). Moreover, ducks in genotype S inoculation group experienced less average body weight gain than those in the genotype A inoculation group. Compared to their weights on the initial inoculation date, the average body weight of ducks in the control group demonstrated a 3.79-fold increase, whereas those in the genotype A and genotype S inoculation groups exhibited increases of 3.61-fold and 3.21-fold, respectively. Figure 3 Figure 3. The changes in body weight of Yunnan mallard ducks challenged with H9N2 over a period of 14 dpi (days post inoculation). Body weights are graphed as the fold change, comparing them to the initial values on the day of inoculation (0 dpi). The genotype A and genotype S inoculation groups consisted of ducks intranasally inoculated with the CC-3 and CK-74 strains, respectively. The control group consisted of ducks inoculated with allantoic fluid without the virus via the same route. Significantly, during the initial 3 days following inoculation, a pronounced suppression in body weight gain was noted (Figure 3). Specifically, on 3 dpi, the fold changes in body weight were 1.41 for the control group, 1.25 for the genotype A inoculation group, and 1.19 for the genotype S inoculation group, compared to their initial weights. Subsequently, from 4 dpi onwards, ducks in the genotype A group demonstrated body weight gains comparable to those observed in the control group. In contrast, ducks in the genotype S group began to show similar body weight gains to the control group from 9 dpi (Figure 3). 3.4 Viral shedding and replication characteristics Viral shedding patterns were assessed by quantifying viral load in OP and CL swabs through rRT-PCR targeting the M gene. In the genotype S inoculation group treated with CK-74, the viral load in OP samples was very high on 1 dpi, slightly decreased on 3 dpi, and peaked on 4 dpi (p < 0.01), before declining thereafter. The CL samples in this group exhibited low viral load levels, remaining below the detectable limit except on 7 dpi. Throughout this period, the viral load in OP samples consistently exceeded that in CL samples (p < 0.05) (Figure 4A). Similarly, the genotype A inoculation group treated with CC-3 showed a comparable pattern in OP samples, where viral loads were with higher in the early phase (days 1, 3, and 4 dpi) compared to the later phase (days 7, 10, and 14 dpi), with a peak on 3 dpi (p < 0.001). In contrast, the viral load in CL samples for the genotype A group remained elevated until 7 dpi (p < 0.01) and was still detectable on day 14 dpi (Figure 4B). Figure 4 Figure 4. Virus loads in oropharyngeal, cloacal swabs and various organs of Yunnan mallard ducks challenged with genotype A and genotype S H9N2 AIV. Oropharyngeal and cloacal swab samples are collected from genotype S (A) and genotype A (B) H9N2 AIV inoculation groups at 1 dpi (days post inoculation), 3 dpi, 4 dpi, 7 dpi, 10 dpi, and 14 dpi. Tissue samples are obtained from four ducks in each group at 4 dpi (C) and 14 dpi (D). The genotype A inoculation group and genotype S inoculation group are treated with CC-3 and CK-74 strains, respectively, while control group is not exposed to any virus. Virus loads are determined based on viral RNA levels expressed as equivalents of EID50 (eqEID50). The eqEID50 values are obtained by correlating viral titers to Ct values through rRT-PCR for the M gene, using viral standards with known tenfold dilution viral titers ranging from 106.0 to 100.0 EID50 per 0.2 mL in egg allantoic fluid. The standards show the limit of detection at 100.22 EID50 for genotype S strain and 101.04 EID50 for genotype A strain. Samples with virus loads below the limit of detection are assigned values of 0.22 log eqEID50 for genotype S inoculation group and 1.04 log eqEID50 for genotype A inoculation group, respectively. Two-way ANOVA is performed using GraphPad Prism software version 9.5.0. Significance levels are indicated by symbols: ***for p < 0.001, **for p < 0.01, and *for p < 0.05. The levels of viral RNA in tissues were used to assess the replication characteristics of the strains within the tissues. By 4 dpi, viral loads were detectable in all tissues of ducks, except for the duodenum in the genotype S inoculation group treated with CK-74 (Figure 4C). In this group, the viral loads in seven other tissues were significantly higher than those observed in the genotype A inoculation group treated with CC-3 (p < 0.05). Notably, the liver, heart, lungs, and trachea exhibited significantly higher viral loads compared to other tissues in both groups (p < 0.01). By 14 dpi, viral loads decreased across both groups. In the genotype S inoculation group, duodenum tissue continued to show undetectable viral loads (Figure 4D); however, liver, spleen, and thymus maintained higher viral loads compared to other tissues (p < 0.05). Conversely, in the genotype A inoculation group, while trachea and kidney tissues had undetectable viral loads at this time point, duodenum tissue retained a similar viral load as observed at 4 dpi and was significantly higher than that in trachea, liver, lung, kidney and heart (p < 0.01). 3.5 Pathological characteristics Macroscopic and microscopic pathological alterations in eight tissue organs were observed at 4 dpi. Ducks from genotype S inoculation group treated with strain CK-74 exhibited extensive macroscopic pathologies, including congestion and enlargement of organs, accompanied by softening and increased fragility of the livers and lungs. Similarly, approximately 50% of the ducks in genotype A inoculation group treated with strain CC-3 demonstrated analogous macroscopic changes, such as swelling and congestion in various organs, specifically the liver, lungs, trachea, and duodenum (Figure 5). Figure 5 Figure 5. Macroscopic and microscopic pathological lesions observed in the eight tissue organs from Yunnan mallard duck challenged with genotype A and genotype S H9N2 AIV at 4 days post inoculation. (A–C) Illustrate the gross lesions (Scale bar = 1 cm), while (a–c) illustrate the corresponding microscopic lesions (Scale bar = 10 μm). Tissues presented in (A, a) originate from ducks in the control group, which are inoculated with virus-free chick embryo amniotic fluid. Conversely, tissues shown in (B, b, C, c), are derived from ducks in the genotype S and genotype A inoculation groups, treated with CK-74 and CC-3 strains, respectively. Notable microscopic injuries are marked including hepatocellular steatosis (black triangle), hydropic degeneration (green triangle), inflammatory infiltration (green pentagram), hyperemia (black pentagram), tracheal ciliated epithelium desquamation (black diamond-shaped), and duodenal muscle layer rupture (green diamond-shaped). Microscopic examination of hematoxylin-eosin-stained tissues corroborated the presence of these injuries (Figure 5). Liver tissues from both virus-inoculated groups exhibited hyperemia, hepatocellular steatosis and hydropic degeneration, characterized by cellular ballooning. Virus-inoculated ducks exhibited significant infiltration of inflammatory cells and alveolar hemorrhagic activity in the lungs, accompanied by desquamation in the tracheal pseudostratified columnar ciliated epithelium. The pathological features observed, such as inflammatory infiltration and hyperemia, were similarly evident in the renal parenchyma and cardiac muscle fibers in these virus-treated ducks. Moreover, in ducks inoculated with genotype S, atrophy and lymphocytic hydropic degeneration were noted in the spleen's white pulp, along with marked congestion in the cortical area of the thymus. Notably, intestinal tissues from ducks in genotype A group exhibited substantial damage of duodenal muscle layer rupture, a phenomenon absent in ducks from the genotype S group. 4 Discussion During the 1990s, genotype A H9N2 AIV was prevalent in China. Since 2010, genotype S H9N2 has emerged as the predominant strain nationwide (Liu et al., 2016). Phylogenetic analysis of the 11 H9N2 isolates from Yunnan Province in this study reveals that both genotype A and S currently coexist in this region. Notably, genotype S is the dominant strain circulating among poultry populations, whereas genotype A is primarily found in wild birds (Figure 2). As previously reported, the genotype S isolates were characterized by a tripartite assortment, comprising the HA, NA, and NS genes from the BJ/94-like lineage, the PB1, PA, and NP genes from the F/98-like lineage, and the PB2 and M genes from the G1-like lineage (Liu et al., 2016). In contrast, all eight gene segments of genotype A isolates were derived from the BJ/94-like lineage (Liu et al., 2003). Aquatic birds, serving as natural hosts, are the primary reservoirs for transmitting AIV to domestic poultry (Spackman, 2009). Recent findings from this study have identified a genotype S strain, predominantly found in domestic poultry, within wild bar-headed geese, thereby confirming inter-species transmission of AIV between domestic and wild avian populations. Remarkably, all isolates derived from wild birds exhibited some characteristics typical of strains found in domestic birds, including a deletion of amino acids 63-65 in the stalk domain of the NA protein and the N166D mutation in the HA protein (Lv et al., 2015; Jin et al., 2019; Peacock et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2023). These observations suggest a potential transmission route from domestic to wild birds within Yunnan Province. Domestic ducks serve as an interface between wild waterfowl and terrestrial poultry, acting as potential vectors for virus transmission across species (Bi et al., 2016). In the rural areas surrounding the plateau wetlands of Yunnan Province, backyard-raised Yunnan mallard ducks frequently utilize the same water resources as wild wading birds. To investigate this interaction, we conducted viral challenge experiments using Yunnan mallard ducks exposed to genotype A and S strains of H9N2 AIV. Our findings reveal that both strains replicated in various organs and were shed via oropharyngeal or cloacal routes. These results imply that interactions between Yunnan mallard ducks and proximate wild birds may facilitate the transmission of viruses from domestic poultry to wild birds, highlighting the role of domestic ducks in the spread of avian influenza viruses. From the animal challenge study, we also observed that the two genotypes exhibited different oropharyngeal and cloacal shedding patterns, with significant differences in viral loads in the duodenum tissue (Figure 4). The attachment of the receptor binding site (RBS) of the viral HA protein to host cell receptors is a critical step in the transmission of AIV (Imai et al., 2012). These receptors are primarily terminal sialic acids (SA) conjugated to galactose via α-2,3 or α-2,6 glycosidic bonds, forming SA α-2,3-gal and SA α-2,6-gal linked receptors, respectively. The interaction between these SA linkages and the viral HA protein exhibits specific preferences. The HA proteins of both G1-like and BJ/94-like strains, originating from avian hosts, have been reported to favor SA α-2,3-gal linked receptors (Lv et al., 2015; Peacock et al., 2017). However, the Q226L mutation in the viral HA protein may switch receptor binding specificity to SA α-2,6-gal linked receptors, facilitated by an increased hydrophobic environment and stronger hydrogen bond interactions (Gamblin et al., 2021). In ducks, SA α-2,3-gal linked receptors are widely present in the intestinal tract and predominate in the respiratory organs, where SA α-2,6-gal linked receptors are also distributed (Zhao and Pu, 2022). The analyzed genotype S H9N2 strain CK-74 exhibits the Q226L mutation in its HA protein, whereas the genotype A H9N2 strain CC-3 lacks this mutation (Table 2). It can thus be inferred from these existing scientific observations of viral binding preferences from their HA proteins that the genotype S strain may preferentially bind to SA α-2, 6-gal linked receptors, which are expressed in the respiratory tract, whereas the genotype A strain may be inclined to bind to SA α-2, 3-gal linked receptors, primarily found in the digestive tract. This receptor specificity might explain the observed differences in virus shedding patterns, with the genotype S strain exhibiting oropharyngeal shedding and the genotype A strain displaying cloacal shedding. It is may also responsible for the continuous high viral load and the damage of muscle layer rupture in duodenal tissues of the genotype A inoculated ducks. Furthermore, this was verified that genotype A strains in aquatic birds exhibited gastrointestinal tropism and primarily spread through the oral-fecal route, whereas genotype S strains tend to show more respiratory tropism (Killingley and Nguyen-Van-Tam, 2013; Lv et al., 2015). In this study, we observed significant lymphocyte recruitment in various internal organs, including the liver, lungs, heart, and kidneys following H9N2 AIV infection, accompanied by necrosis of hepatocytes and tracheal epithelial cells (Figure 5). A direct correlation exists between neutrophil recruitment and histopathological lesions associated with H9N2 infection in broiler chickens (Bóna et al., 2023), mice and pigeons (Short et al., 2014). During virus infection, pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) common to various microorganisms, including AIV, are recognized by host cell pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) (Kaiser et al., 2016). This recognition triggers the host's innate immune response, producing pro-inflammatory cytokines and recruiting neutrophils, macrophages, and T lymphocytes (Kaushal, 2023). These cytokines and leukocytes create a positive feedback loop, leading to high production of proteases, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and reactive nitrogen species (RNS), which increase tissue permeability and cause cell necrosis (Short et al., 2014; Soares et al., 2023). The genotype S strain CK-74 induced more severe injury to internal organs compared to the genotype A strain CC-3. The differences in amino acid mutations between the two strains were analyzed, among which nine key mutations, including I292V (PB2 protein), K356R (PA protein), and I353V (NP protein) are associated with increased virulence or replication efficiency (Naffakh et al., 2008; Xu et al., 2016; Guo et al., 2022) (Table 2). These specific amino acid mutations may contribute to the pronounced pathological changes observed in the genotype S isolate. However, this hypothesis requires further experimental validation to confirm the association between these amino acid sites and pathogenicity in ducks. In summary, we identified H9N2 AIVs from wild birds exhibiting characteristics typical of poultry strains, suggesting a possible transmission route from domestic poultry to wild birds. The Yunnan mallard duck may act as an intermediary in this transmission process. Currently, at least two genotypes of H9N2 AIV are involved in this transmission: wild bird-deriving genotype A predominantly exhibits gastrointestinal tropism and sheds virus primarily via the cloacal route, while domestic bird-deriving genotype S sheds virus mainly through the oropharyngeal (OP) route. Genotype A H9N2 AIV, which were prevalent in Chinese domestic poultry 40 years ago and are now also present in wild avian populations, remain uncertain in terms of how long they have been circulating in wild birds. Additionally, the reasons why genotype A strains did not evolve and reassort in wild birds as they did in domestic poultry remain unclear. Further research is needed to understand the dynamics of AIV transmission and evolution in different host species.

Results add another piece of the puzzleThe experiments, first reported in early May by Science, centered around infecting the udder through the teats in a high-containment lab setting. In a statement, the group said that, for both viruses, cows showed clear signs of disease such as a sharp drop in milk production, changes in milk consistency, and fever.The researchers said the findings don't change their avian flu risk assessment, which they consider low, given that it already covers the chance of infections with other highly pathogenic H5 strains. "Nevertheless, increased vigilance is recommended, and HPAI H5 should also be considered in investigations, especially in the case of unclear and frequent cases of disease in dairy herds," the team wrote.Direct infection of the udder is one of the transmission paths seen in US cattle, and extremely high viral levels have been found in the milk of infected cows. Recent tissue sample examination from US cows revealed that the H5N1 virus infects epithelial cells of mammary alveoli, prompting acute inflammation in the udder, which could explain the drop in milk production and high virus levels in milk.It's not clear how the virus first jumped from wild birds to cows in the United States, but risk to ruminants has been present since the virus was first detected 27 years ago. The Loeffler Institute scientists referenced water buffalo in Asia that had contact with the feces of wild birds.Kai Kupferschmidt, a writer from Science who has been tracking the experiments in cows, said on X today that the findings seem to answer one of the puzzling aspects of the H5N1 situation in US dairy cows: whether there is something special about B3.13 that led to the infections.The Loeffler Institute researchers said they have tested about 1,400 serum samples from German cows from regions affected by avian flu, and so far no antibodies have been seen. The group also tested 350 tank milk samples from different regions, which were also negative.More detections in US cows, mice, poultryIn other H5N1 developments, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) over the last few days has confirmed 14 more avian flu outbreaks on dairy farms, raising the total to 116. The latest detections are from Iowa (4), Idaho (3), Minnesota (3), Colorado (2), and Texas (2).The virus continues to turn up on poultry farms, and APHIS confirmed two more outbreaks in Minnesota, both involving commercial turkey farms. One is located in Pipestone County and has 73,800 birds, and the other is a facility in Swift County that houses 114,600 birds. Both are in the southwestern part of the state.Also, APHIS recently confirmed 19 more H5N1 detections in house mice, raising the total to 66. All are from New Mexico's Roosevelt County.

ASPR has personal protective equipment (PPE) and antiviral drugs available in the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS), as well as antiviral drugs like oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and materials for vaccines should human-to-human transmission occur. So far, just three H5N1 cases in people have been confirmed in the United States in 2024. The SNS includes a large inventory of PPE available to protect healthcare workers. ASPR is also offering face shields, gloves, N95 respirators, elastomeric half-mask respirators, and goggles for farm workers or others who interact with infected cattle or other animals."ASPR's mission is to help the country prepare for, respond to, and recover from public health emergencies and disasters," the agency said. "The SNS contributes to this mission as the nation's largest repository of emergency medical supplies. While many states hold large supplies of PPE in state-held stockpiles, if those stockpiles of PPE are depleted or unavailable, federal supplies managed by SNS may be requested."Third outbreak in Iowa poultry this yearYesterday the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship reported an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in a commercial turkey flock in Sac County. This is Iowa's third confirmation of HPAI in poultry flocks in 2024. Sac County is in the west-central part of the state.In response to the outbreak, Gov. Kim Reynolds authorized a disaster proclamation for Sac County effective for 1 month. The proclamation allows state resources to assist with tracking and monitoring, rapid detection, containment, disposal, and disinfection. CDC data show uptick in COVID-19 cases, low flu activity News brief Chris Dall, MA Topics COVID-19 Influenza, General The latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) today indicate that COVID-19 activity continues to rise across the country, albeit at low levels. ismagilov / iStock According to the CDC's COVID Data Tracker, test positivity was 6.6% for the week ending June 15, up 1.2% from the previous week. Emergency department visits for COVID-19 were up 14.7% from the previous week and now stand at 0.7%. In its weekly snapshot of respiratory viral illnesses, the CDC said COVID infections are growing or likely growing in 39 states and territories and stable or uncertain in 10 states and territories.The agency's two severity indicators—hospitalizations and deaths—also show notable upticks. Hospitalizations through June 1 are up 25% from the previous week, while deaths are up 16.7%. But hospitalization and death rates remain low overall, however, compared with peak periods of the pandemic.Data from the CDC's National Wastewater Surveillance System show that COVID wastewater levels nationally are low, but several states in the West are reporting high viral activity, and six states—Alaska, Hawaii, New Mexico, Missouri, Florida, and Connecticut—are reporting very high activity. The latest data from WastewaterSCAN, a national wastewater monitoring system based at Stanford University in partnership with Emory University, suggest COVID wastewater levels are high nationally.Shifting variantsThe uptick appears to be driven by increases in the KP.3, KP.2, and LB.1 variants, which now account for 71.4% of sequenced samples, up from 61% the previous week, according to today's variant proportion update. All three variants are offshoots of the JN.1 lineage and carry key mutations in the spike protein that could help them evade antibodies."KP.3 and LB.1 are projected to continue increasing as proportions of the variants that cause COVID-19," the CDC said.Meanwhile, seasonal flu activity remains low, the CDC said in its weekly FluView report. But the agency noted that three additional influenza-associated pediatric deaths that occurred during the 2023-24 season were reported during the week ending June 15, bringing the total number of pediatric deaths for the season to 178. That compares with 185 deaths in the 2022-23 season. Study supports more selective use of preventive antibiotics for cataract surgery News brief Chris Dall, MA Topics Antimicrobial Stewardship DragonImages / iStock A longitudinal cohort study found that the use of a disinfectant combined with selective preventive antibiotics during cataract surgery may be as effective as routine antibiotics for preventing postoperative endophthalmitis, Dutch researchers reported yesterday in JAMA Ophthalmology.The study examined incidence data from Rotterdam Eye Hospital (REH), where clinicians since 2016 have adhered to a regimen of preoperative disinfection with 1% povidone combined with intracameral antibiotic prophylaxis only after complicated cataract surgery to prevent endophthalmitis, a serious inflammatory eye condition caused by infection. While the standard regimen for preventing endophthalmitis over the past few decades has been 5% povidone combined with routine intracameral antibiotics (ICA), questions have been raised about widespread use of routine antibiotics in patients undergoing the most performed surgical procedure in the world.The researchers found that postoperative endophthalmitis incidence after 58,598 cataract procedures conducted at REH from 2016 through 2022 was 0.000, which was the same level found in a literature search of 37 studies examining postoperative endophthalmitis incidence with the standard regimen.No substantial difference in postoperative endophthalmitis"The REH data show that a low level of postoperative endophthalmitis was associated with 1% povidone iodine disinfection in combination with selective prophylactic antibiotic use and that postoperative endophthalmitis incidence did not substantially differ from routine antibiotic use," the study authors wrote.They add that limiting antibiotic prophylaxis to complicated cataract surgery may be preferable to routinely exposing large numbers of patients to prophylactic antibiotics.An accompanying commentary by French and Australian experts, however, questions whether selective use of ICA could lead to potentially avoidable cases of endophthalmitis in uncomplicated cataract surgery."This case series may raise more questions as to whether selective use of ICA might be equally effective when used routinely and that further assessment of this possibility probably would be worthwhile," the authors wrote. CDC closes investigation into Salmonella outbreak tied to basil after 36 cases News brief Stephanie Soucheray, MA Topics Salmonella cookbookman17 / Flickr cc The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) this week declared an end to its investigation of a Salmonella outbreak linked to fresh organic basil after 36 cases were reported. Four people required hospitalization, but there were no confirmed deaths in the outbreak, which saw cases reported in 14 states. Seven people were sickened in Florida, six in Minnesota, and five in Massachusetts, with a number states reporting smaller outbreaks. When the outbreak was first announced in April, 12 people in seven states had become ill, many after eating fresh basil sold at Trader Joe's grocery stores. The organic basil was sold by Infinite Herbs of Miami, which completed a voluntary recall. Trader Joe's pulled the product from its shelves and stopped shipments of the basil on April 12. Implicated basil no longer for sale The CDC said illnesses started on dates ranging from February 11, 2024, to May 26, 2024. The average age of case-patients was 39, with people ages 1 to 78 sickened. Seventy-eight percent were female."State and local public health officials interviewed people about the foods they ate in the week before they got sick. Of the 24 people interviewed, 18 (75%) reported eating basil," the CDC said. Recalled basil is no longer available for sale, and the use-by dates have passed, the CDC said.In related news, US federal officials are investigating a new outbreak of Salmonella Typhimurium with at least 47 illnesses, but the source of the pathogen is unknown, according to Food Safety News. Quick Takes: Mpox in South Africa, measles in Kenya, polio in 3 countries News brief Chris Dall, MA Topics Measles Mpox Polio South Africa has identified 6 new cases of mpox, bringing the country's total cases reported since late May to 13, South Africa's Department of Health reported today. The new cases are in Gauteng and Western Cape provinces. Two deaths so far have been reported in the outbreak, which involves the clade 2 virus responsible for global spread. The department also said it had received a batch of the antiviral drug tecovirimat (Tpoxx) for treating patients who experience severe health complications.A measles outbreak that began in Kenya in December 2023 has now reached 1,536 cases and 11 deaths, according to the latest outbreak report from the World Health Organization African Region. Children under the age of 5 have been the hardest hit by the outbreak, with 563 cases, followed by the 15-and-older group (386 cases). Of the reported measles case-patients, 34% were unvaccinated, 6% had received two doses of the measles containing vaccine, 14% had received one dose, and 46% had unknown vaccination status. Kenya's Ministry of Health says it plans to implement a vaccination campaign in affected areas.Three countries reported new polio cases this week, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative said in its latest update. Afghanistan reported 1 case of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) in Hilmand province, bringing the total number of cases reported this year to 6. Nigeria reported 3 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) cases, for a total of 30 this year, and South Sudan reported 1 cVDPV2 case, bringing the country's total this year to 6.

The Trust Project What is this? Here are some quick facts about general avian influenza A (H5N1), also known as “bird flu:” Enterprise graphic Avian influenza is a disease in birds caused by the influenza A virus. These viruses naturally spread among wild aquatic birds worldwide and can infect domestic poultry and other bird and animal species. Highly pathogenic strains can be very contagious and deadly in poultry. ADVERTISEMENT The risk of humans contracting H5N1 from animals (cows, poultry, wild birds) remains low.There have been three human infections in the U.S. since April 2024: one in Texas, two in Michigan. All three cases experienced mild illness and have fully recovered.Risk to the general public remains extremely low. Avian influenza primarily affects birds and is an occupational risk limited to humans who have direct contact with infected birds, cattle or other sick animals and their environments.If you work with animals, be aware of the symptoms of avian influenza, which can include the following:Influenza-like illness (e.g., cough, sore throat and/or fever); Discharge in eyes; Red, itchy, watery eyes. Persons who report symptoms are voluntarily tested for avian influenza and other respiratory illnesses.In some cases, antivirals may be recommended to prevent additional infection. The Minnesota Department of Health will help arrange testing and antiviral treatment as needed.It is safe to eat properly handled and cooked poultry and meat and drink pasteurized milk in the U.S. ADVERTISEMENT Visit Minnesota Board of Animal Health: Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Response at https://www.bah.state.mn.us/hpai for the latest information.The North Country Community Health Services Board (NCCHB) is a legal, governing authority for local public health. The NCCHB works with the Minnesota Department of Health to fund and provide local public health services in the counties of Hubbard, Clearwater and Lake of the Woods. More info at www.ncchb.org.

The percentage of US hospitals requiring vaccination or an exemption has risen in recent years, the study authors said, and illustrates the impact of the 2020 Veterans Health Administration directive requiring flu vaccines or annual waivers as conditions of employment. The study was based on hospital surveys in 2017 and 2021, sent to 881 nonfederal general medical and surgical hospitals with intensive care units and all 127 VA hospitals. Mandate began in 2020For non-federal hospitals, vaccine requirements increased from 69% (365 of 526) in 2017 to 74% (299 of 405) in 2021. But in VA hospitals, mandatory flu vaccinations increased significantly, from 4% (3 of 73) in 2017 to 96% (63 of 66) in 2021.The findings suggest that vaccine mandates, which have been oft-debated since the COVID-19 pandemic began, may not be as controversial as thought.There will always be vaccine hesitancy and concerns about bodily autonomy among health care workers, and seasonal flu vaccine effectiveness is variable."There will always be vaccine hesitancy and concerns about bodily autonomy among health care workers, and seasonal flu vaccine effectiveness is variable," said Todd Greene, MD, MPH, of Michigan Medicine in a University of Michigan press release. "But for people working in the care environment, the benefits of getting vaccinated will generally outweigh any potential risks." Michigan announces financial assistance for dairy farms to help with H5N1 research News brief Lisa Schnirring Topics Avian Influenza (Bird Flu) The Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (MDARD) today announced funding for up to 20 avian flu outbreak dairy farms, at up to $28,000 per farm, to participate in crucial, real-time research studies. maq123 / iStock In a statement, MDARD Director Tim Boring, PhD, said the money is in addition to earlier support announced by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) and that eligible farms would work with MDARD and the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service to complete epidemiologic investigations, participate in real-time longitudinal studies, and engage with Michigan Department of Health and Human Services programs, if applicable.Michigan has drawn praise for its transparency and response activities regarding H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) outbreaks on dairy and poultry farms. "Our HPAI-impacted farms have been incredibly cooperative in Michigan s One Health approach to combat this disease," Boring said. "The research opportunities through this package will help us advance science in real-time to best develop our continued rapid response."More outbreaks in Iowa, MinnesotaIn other H5N1 developments, Iowa yesterday reported another H5N1 outbreaks in a dairy herd, another from Sioux County. Also, Minnesota reported three more outbreaks in dairy herds, all in counties in the central part of the state: Benton, Kandiyohi, and Morrison. Mpox spreads to another DR Congo province News brief Lisa Schnirring Topics Mpox An mpox outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) continues to spread within the country, with the first case reported in North Kivu province, according to a recent update from the World Health Organization (WHO). CDC/ Brian W.J. Mahy The DRC's outbreak began in late 2022 and involves the clade 1 mpox virus, which is different from the clade 2 strain circulating globally. The outbreak is notable, because it is the first in Africa—where much of the disease activity has been related to zoonotic spread—to involve sexual spread. One of the country's hot spots has been Kamatuga in South Kivu province, where a novel clade 1 virus emerged with mutations that make the virus more adapted to circulation among humans. Sequencing suggests, however, that viruses from other parts of the country don't have the mutations.The case in North Kivu province involves a 19-year-old woman whose illness was confirmed in Goma on June 1. Investigators found that she had sexual contact with a person with a suspected infection who had been in South Kivu province. So far in 2024, 7,851 mpox cases have been reported in the DRC, 384 of them fatal. With the case from Noth Kivu province, illnesses have now been reported in 23 of the country's 26 provinces. The disease is spreading through various contact forms, including sexual, nonsexual, household, and healthcare.Children are still the most affected age-group, with 39% of cases in kids younger than 5 years old. The disease was fatal in 240 of those cases. Outbreak in South Africa, case rise in Los AngelesSouth Africa recently reported an mpox outbreak involving the clade 2 virus responsible for global spread. So far, seven cases have been reported, according an update from the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. The country also reported its first two mpox deaths. All cases were severe and involved men ages 30 to 39 who had underlying health conditions such as HIV. So far, investigations have found the patients hadn't traveled to countries that have ongoing outbreaks.In the United States, the Los Angeles Department of Public Health yesterday posted an alert about a rise in mpox cases, with 10 illnesses reported in the past 2 weeks. For comparison, it said during the previous several weeks it was averaging about 2 cases a week. It urged people in risk groups to take precautions and to get vaccinated. Data suggest hybrid immunity protects against long COVID News brief Stephanie Soucheray, MA A study yesterday in the Journal of Infection shows that hybrid immunity from both a fourth vaccination dose and previous COVID-19 illnesses may offer protection against developing long COVID, or post-COVID condition (PCC). The study is based on 109,707 participant surveys collected about health history and self-reported post-infection symptoms in the German National Cohort. More than 80% of the participants had received three or more COVID-19 vaccinations. Of the 60% of participants who said they had had a previous COVID-19 infection, 35% reported persistent symptoms 4 to 12 months after infection. Of those, 23% reported "high PCC," which means nine or more symptoms. Omicron associated with less long COVIDVirus variant type had the greatest influence on developing long COVID. "Any PCC occurred in around 7% after an infection during the Omicron phase for those with a previous infection and in 47% after initial infection with the Wildtype virus," the authors wrote. The risk of developing any PCC after a second infection if PCC did not follow a first infection was substantially lower compared to after the first infection, resulting in a long-term risk reduction of around 50%, the authors said. But the risk of developing long COVID was higher in people who were infected less than 3 months following a vaccination, but approximately 50% compared to those who were infected 4 to 6 months after vaccination. Our findings indicate that the risk of developing PCC was strongly reduced for the second SARS-CoV-2 infection"Our findings indicate that the risk of developing PCC was strongly reduced for the second SARS-CoV-2 infection, if the first infection did not result in PCC," the authors concluded. "It is possible that the occurrence of breakthrough infections shortly after vaccination is linked to a specific vulnerability of the individual towards PCC, and the apparent protection actually results from confounding." Novel antifungal candidate gets financial boost News brief Chris Dall, MA Topics Antimicrobial Stewardship Fungal Infection Biotechnology company Elion Therapeutics of New York City announced yesterday that it has closed an $81 million funding round to advance development of its next-generation polyene antifungal candidate, SF001.SF001 is a novel analog of the antifungal amphotericin B that's been designed to reduce systemic toxicities and has demonstrated potent in vitro fungicidal activity and in vivo efficacy. In 2023, the compound received Qualified Infectious Disease Product and Fast Track designations from the US Food and Drug Administration for early antifungal therapy of presumed invasive fungal infection (IFI) and treatment of invasive aspergillosis.Amphotericin B is a widely used, broad-spectrum polyene antifungal, but its use is associated with kidney toxicity.Rising levels of invasive fungal infections"Invasive fungal infections have reached historic levels of concern, largely due to increased medical reliance on biologic immunosuppression, more people with severe pulmonary disease at risk of IFI, and increased exposures associated with environmental changes," Kieren Marr, MD, MBA, Elion's president and chief medical officer, said in a company press release. "As we move into the next stage of our clinical program, we're optimistic about the potential of SF001 to deliver antifungal treatment with reduced toxicity and the potential to address critical challenges with currently available options."The $81 million funding round includes investments from the AMR Action Fund, a public-private partnership established in 2020 to provide financial and technical support to small biotech companies developing novel antibiotics. It's the fund's first investment in an antifungal company."With resistance to existing antifungals growing and infection rates increasing, it is essential that we develop effective therapies for patients in need," said AMR Action Fund CEO Henry Skinner, PhD, MBE. "We are pleased to support the team at Elion and believe their work could deliver an important treatment for patients suffering from devastating fungal infections." Lab study: Sterilized reused respirators not effective enough against aerosolized particles News brief Mary Van Beusekom, MS Topics COVID-19 Biggereye / iStock Less than 20% of reused filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) collected from nurses amid the COVID-19 pandemic were in good enough condition to undergo sterilization, after which none retained at least 94% filtration of aerosol particles, finds a laboratory study comparing two sterilization methods after up to 15 to 30 days of use.For the study, published in the American Journal of Infection Control, a University of Sao Paulo-led team in Brazil used a chambered box and an emitted aerosol to evaluate the physical characteristics and post-sterilization filtration of a 5-centimeter (2-inch) square fragment from each of 100 reused FFRs (eg, N95s) collected from nurses who cared for COVID-19 patients at three hospitals. Untorn respirators that filtered at least 94% of aerosolized particles and had an attached nasal clip and elastic bands and no visible dirt were randomly assigned to receive or not receive mechanical cleaning with an ultrasonic washer before undergoing hydrogen peroxide plasma gas sterilization."During the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a shortage of Filtering Facepiece Respirators (FFR), leading to prolonged use and reuse of FFRs," the authors noted. "There was also an effort to sterilize FFRs aiming to increase the safety of healthcare professionals as it was thought that sterilization could reduce self-contamination and protect the environment from excess contaminated waste."Over 78% of FFRs were too dirty to sterilizeOf the 1,055 FFRs, over 85% retained secured nose clips, preserved strap elasticity, and no tears. But over 78% of samples were dirty (eg, from makeup), leaving only 19.6% eligible to undergo sterilization. None of the FFRs—cleaned or uncleaned—reached minimum filtration after sterilization, although 72% of the uncleaned FFRs and 80% of the cleaned devices achieved 90.0% to 93.9% filtration.Sterilization processes using hydrogen peroxide plasma gas, both with and without prior cleaning, applied to 100 FFRs with preserved functionality, did not compromise the apparent physical characteristics of these respirators, but did not maintain their filtration levels to the minimum necessary to be considered safe."Sterilization processes using hydrogen peroxide plasma gas, both with and without prior cleaning, applied to 100 FFRs with preserved functionality, did not compromise the apparent physical characteristics of these respirators, but did not maintain their filtration levels to the minimum necessary to be considered safe," the researchers concluded. Quick takes: Pandemic unreadiness, 21-strain pneumococcal vaccine, chikungunya vaccine submission News brief Lisa Schnirring Topics Pandemic Influenza Pneumonia Chikungunya Business Preparedness Amid increased H5N1 avian flu circulation in mammal populations and mpox deaths in African children, the world hasn't done enough to prepare for its next pandemic threat, an independent group that reviewed the world's COVID response for the World Health Organization (WHO) said today. In a report that takes stock of progress on its earlier recommendations, the Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response said world leaders have turned away from pandemic preparedness, leading to a gamble with the world's future. They said funding for pandemic preparedness pales compared to needs and that high-income countries are too tightly bound to charity-based approaches. They noted some causes for hope, however, such as recent amendments to the International Health Regulations by the World Health Assembly and a decision in 2023 to increased unearmarked funding to the WHO's base budget. Among their recommendations, they urged member states to make progress on the pandemic agreement and adopt it by December 2024.Merck yesterday announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved its 21-valent conjugate vaccine for preventing invasive pneumococcal disease and pneumococcal pneumonia in adults. The vaccine, called Capvaxive, was assessed under FDA priority review, which included four phase 2 studies that found robust immune response in vaccine-naïve and vaccine-experienced populations. In a statement, the company said the vaccine is intended for adults and covers serotypes that are responsible for 84% of invasive pneumococcal disease in people ages 50 and older. It includes eight serotypes that aren't included in other currently approved pneumococcal vaccines. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention vaccine advisory group is expected to weigh in with a recommendation for use of the vaccine next week.Bavarian Nordic yesterday announced that it has completed the rolling submission process to the FDA for its candidate chikungunya vaccine. The virus-like particle vaccine is given as a single dose, and the company said it would be made in prefilled syringes. Bavarian Nordic said the vaccine is indicated for people ages 12 and older and that the licensing application is the first against the virus for adolescents. The submission paves the way for potential approval in the first half of 2025. If approved, it would be the FDA's second for a chikungunya vaccine. In November 2023, the FDA approved Valneva's chikungunya vaccine for use in adults.

There's no evidence the virus can cause a human outbreak, but authorities are keeping a close eye on the situation. What do we know about the H5N1 virus and how worried should we be?What is bird flu?Bird flu is a disease caused by a virus that infects birds and sometimes other animals, such as foxes, seals and otters.The major strain - circulating among wild birds worldwide - is a type of the virus known as H5N1. It emerged in China in the late 1990s. Bird migration has led to outbreaks in domestic and wild birds. The virus has in very rare cases infected humans.Scientists say the current risk to humans is low. Transmission from birds to humans is rare and there has been no sustained human-to-human transmission.There is no way to predict whether avian flu will trigger a pandemic in humans, but experts are monitoring its spread and studying how it is changing and evolving. Getty ImagesH5N1 is now spreading rapidly in dairy cow herds in the US in what the US Centres for Disease Control, CDC, describes as an "ongoing multi-state outbreak".The virus's jump into cattle astounded scientists, who thought cows weren't susceptible to it.It comes amid another unusual development: In early June, a 59-year-old man in Mexico died with another type of bird flu - H5N2 - which had never before been recorded in people. It is unclear how he got it, although there have been cases in some poultry farms in Mexico.Health bodies such as the World Health Organization and the CDC consider the overall public health risk from bird flu to be low. But scientists say we need to keep a close eye on the spread of the virus."This case is one more in a series of developments that collectively could be considered a red flag," says Professor Sir Peter Horby, director of the Pandemic Sciences Institute at the University of Oxford.H5N1 has been on scientists' radar for the past few years, with the virus spreading across all continents. Thousands of outbreaks have been recorded in poultry and wild birds.There have been outbreaks in animals farmed for their fur, including mink. In late 2023 in Peru, more than 5,000 sea lions died with the virus, which scientists say was caused by the animals' direct contact with infected wild birds. The virus has also been detected in foxes, bears, otters, raccoons, cats, dogs, goats and others."It's a virus that's on the march so we've been watching it with concern for that reason," says Dr Ed Hutchinson, Senior Lecturer, MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research.Getty ImagesThe recent spike in bird flu has been particularly harmful to protected seabird species like the gannetFlu viruses are known for their ability to shape-shift, picking up genes and changing over time as they move outside their natural host.Scientists are watching closely for signs H5N1 might gain a sustained foothold outside poultry and wild birds.The move into cowsFinding the virus in cattle was "a real shock", says Dr Hutchinson."When it turns up in an animal where large numbers of them are farmed and therefore in close proximity with humans that immediately is a reason for paying close attention to it."Scientists think the route of transmission is what they call "artificial" - the cows are not passing it to one another through natural contact and it probably isn't transmitting in airborne particles from cow to cow.Instead, they think all the transmission is happening in milking parlours. "It looks like it's through contaminated milking machinery," explains Dr Thomas Peacock from the Pirbright Institute.This means that the virus, at the moment, doesn't have the ability to spread naturally from animal to animal. The longer it does go on spreading through dairy herds though, Dr Peacock says, the higher the chance that it evolves in a way that would allow it to do that.Pasteurisation is understood to destroy the virus, but it's estimated that about 5% of Americans consume raw, unpasteurised milk.Across the border in Canada, scientists have also begun testing milk.Can bird flu spread to humans?There have been cases of humans catching H5N1 from time to time, usually from contact with sick animals, in several countries, including Cambodia, Chile, China, Vietnam, Australia, USA and the UK.A few hundred human cases have been reported since 1997, around half of whom died.Getty ImagesBird flu has decimated pelican colonies in GreeceMore recently, there have been a few cases in US dairy workers, who had only mild symptoms.Many US states are investing in preventative measures, like protective clothing and goggles for farm workers.Experts studying the virus say there's no evidence it has morphed into a form that would pose a big threat to humans.But as two eminent flu experts warned in an article in the British Medical Journal: "the hazard and risk of a major outbreak of H5N1 are large, plausible and imminent."Virologist Tom Peacock says the more that it spreads across the US, the higher the chance that the virus gets into humans.And, importantly, the higher the chance that it gets into waterfowl - ducks and geese. "That's what we're worried about," he tells the BBC. "Because [those birds] are the ones that one are very susceptible to this, and they seem to be the ones that carry it very large distances.What can we do about bird flu?Some countries are discussing deploying vaccines or are working to secure supplies.But with only limited supplies available, any vaccine campaign would be limited, with doses distributed to front line workers including poultry farmers, veterinarians, scientists who study the virus, and people who work on fur farms housing animals like mink and fox.Getty ImagesOtters are amongst the mammals which have caught bird fluDr Jayna Raghwani, a biologist from the UK's Royal Veterinary College, points out that, in terms of designing new avian flu vaccines, we are relatively well prepared."We don't have to start from scratch with an influenza virus," she says. "And we have a good understanding of how those [existing flu vaccines] work in order to raise an immune response and be protective."In an ideal world," she adds, there would be more surveillance for the virus close to farms. "We could do more general monitoring of wildlife close to places we know outbreaks are occurring and more in domestic animals," Dr Raghwani says, "to better understand how the virus changes between species.""I don't want to downplay concerns about the influenza [circulating in cows]," says Dr Raghwani. "But if I was talking to my mum or my grandma about the current risk to humans, I would say 'don't worry'."Dr Hutchinson puts it this way: "It's not February 2020 but it does demand our close attention. There are definite risks associated with this and they might not go anywhere but we'd be very foolish not to pay attention to them."BirdsRelatedRed list gull 'deliberately' killed at McDonald's12 hrs agoEssexEmus found after escaping from farm 16 hrs agoTeesEighteen swans found dead under power line20 hrs agoCambridgeshireBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsUS ElectionSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthVideoLiveAudioWeatherBBC ShopBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoContact technical supportCopyright 2024 BBC.

Our objective was to determine migratory connectivity of Blue-winged Teal and evaluate the risk of AIV introduction to Cuba by this species. The stable hydrogen isotope (δ2H) value in flight feathers was analyzed. Individuals were sampled during the migratory season of 2021 (N=126) and winter residence of 2020 (N=152), in western and central Cuba, respectively. Based on banding records from 1955 to 2018, the transition probabilities from 3 breeding areas in North America to 9 wintering areas was estimated with a Burnham’s live-recapture dead-recovery modeling framework. A map of likely origin in North America of the individuals sampled for each season was generated, combining the isotopic information and transition probabilities. Evidence of an age-related and phenological pattern in migratory origins was identified. Individuals harvested in the migratory season in western Cuba were most likely from molt or natal areas in the prairies and forest regions from United States and southern Canada. Alternatively, individuals harvested in winter in the center of Cuba had the most likely origin in the U.S. prairie region. The spatial-temporal pattern of AIV prevalence in the estimated region was analyzed and suggestions are made to assist the Cuban system of active AIV surveillance of wild birds.1 IntroductionThe emergence of the H5N1 subtype of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) of Asian origin in 2003 marked a dramatic change in terms of disease occurrence and distribution. Since then, billions of domestic birds have died or been culled due to HPAI (WAHIS, 2024). Currently, the global recurrence, spread and significant increase HPAI outbreaks is affecting domestic and wild birds, and some terrestrial and aquatic mammals, reflecting a distinct change in the epidemiology and ecology of the virus and posing a threat to animal health, public health, food security and biodiversity (WOAH, 2024).The dynamics and evolution of avian influenza virus (AIV) are significantly influenced by the ecology and biogeography of its primary hosts, which are primarily wild waterfowl (Olsen et al., 2006). This virus has the capacity to infect over 90 bird species across 13 orders (Breban et al., 2009), with the most representative hosts being from the orders Anseriformes and Charadriiformes. Species within these orders are regarded as reservoirs for the virus and thus, play a crucial role in AIV maintenance and dispersion (Kilpatrick et al., 2006; Newman et al., 2012). Long-distance migration is a central trait of these species, contributing significantly to the virus spread (van Toor et al., 2018). This underscores the importance of considering wild birds and ecological processes like migration in active surveillance strategies and AIV circulation studies.Surveillance programs are crucial for the early detection of the virus and for identifying the most likely seasons and areas for outbreaks (Bevins et al., 2014). However, investigations and monitoring have varied in intensity regionally because conducting active virus surveys in wild birds is both costly and challenging, requiring a significant investment in effort and resources (Brown et al., 2018). Consequently, studies and active surveillance programs remain limited in regions like Latin America and the Caribbean (Olsen et al., 2006; Ferrer et al., 2014; Brown et al., 2018). However, risk-based surveillance can be helpful in directing resources and efforts to those locations or periods of the year where the risk is most likely to occur, leading to improvements in cost-effectiveness of surveillance (Cameron, 2012).The description and analysis of migratory connectivity in host species can provide information on viral circulation. Establishing migratory connectivity requires identifying the geographical links between individuals and populations from one season of their life cycle to another, offering insights into the degree of mixing between breeding populations on wintering grounds or vice versa (Webster et al., 2002; Bauer et al., 2016; Hobson et al., 2019). This information allows for inferences to be made regarding the origin of infected individuals and the pathways of virus spread (Jourdain et al., 2007; Prosser et al., 2009; Gunnarsson et al., 2012; Newman et al., 2012; Bessell et al., 2016).The Caribbean region, situated adjacent to North America, serves as a critical wintering area for numerous waterbird species that breed in North America (Aguilar et al., 2020). However, research on the connectivity of Neotropical migratory species in the Caribbean is limited, with a focus on a few passerines, seabirds, shorebirds, and a single waterfowl species (Rubenstein et al., 2002; Szymanski and Dubovsky, 2013; Cohen et al., 2014; Hobson et al., 2014; Ramey et al., 2016; Lyons et al., 2017; Reed et al., 2018). Given the potential for the introduction and spread of North American-origin viruses through bird migration in the Caribbean (Brown et al., 2018; Pupo-Antunez et al., 2018), there is a need for active virus surveillance programs, especially in key locations. Cuba serves as a crucial stopover site for birds en route to other Caribbean islands and South America (Aguilar et al., 2020), making it of regional significanceIn addition to the passive surveillance of HPAI, Cuba has implemented an active surveillance system based on risk focused on poultry (Ferrer et al., 2014), which was later improved through geospatial multi-criteria analysis of the disease risk of occurrence (Ippoliti et al., 2019; Montano et al., 2020). For wild birds, locations and species in which avian influenza viruses are most likely to be found were deduced (Alfonso et al., in press). Results highlight certain waterfowl species, such as the Blue-winged Teal (Spatula discors, hereafter BWTE) and Lesser Scaup (Aythya affinis), as potential introducers of the virus. Specifically, BWTE stands out as the most abundant Anatidae species in Cuba (Aguilar et al., 2020).BWTE is recognized as a significant contributor to the exchange of parasites and pathogens between North America and the Neotropics (Smith and Ramey, 2015; Ramey et al., 2016). This species plays a role in the spread of AIV in both North and South America (González-Reiche et al., 2012; Ramey et al., 2014; Humphreys et al., 2020), given its high prevalence and diversity of AIV subtypes (Olsen et al., 2006; Munster et al., 2007; Bevins et al., 2014; Papp et al., 2017). To the best of our knowledge, the migratory connectivity of wild birds has been utilized to a limited extent in combination with the analysis of the risk of pathogen incursion transmitted by them to new areas in the Neotropics, which could represent opportunities for managing this risk in the face of a lack of information.The aim of this study was to assess the migratory connectivity between North America and Cuba of BWTE and its implications for the risk of AIV introduction to Cuba. Our work is expected to inform recommendations for further improvements of the cost-effective active surveillance system in Cuba.2 Materials and methods2.1 Feather sampling areas and preparationFeather samples from BWTE were collected during the autumn migration and wintering seasons in Cuba. During the autumn migration of 2021, samples were collected on ten different dates, from September to November, in western Cuba. The sampling area was Bajos de Santa Ana, situated west of Havana on the north coast of Cuba (23°04’06’’ N, 82°31’33’’ W). This location is a known stopover site for waterfowl during migration and consists of a mangrove forest covering approximately 21.9 hectares. The site experiences significant human activity due to its proximity to the town of Santa Fe. Presently, because of habitat degradation and hunting pressure, it serves as a stopover site for only a brief period. These characteristics ensured that the samples were obtained from individuals exclusively engaged in migration.During the winter season, feathers were collected from the Southern Sancti Spíritus Wetland, located in the central region of Cuba (21°38’09’’ N, 79°12’20’’ W), in December 2020. This area is recognized as an Important Bird Area. The majority of this wetland region is occupied by rice fields, covering approximately 27,000 hectares (Acosta et al., 2002). Separated from the sea by a coastal belt of wetlands containing mangroves and several lagoons (BirdLife International, 2020) to the west, it adjoins a group of lagoons and intertidal mudflats that are part of the Tunas de Zaza Fauna Refuge. The entire coastal area serves as a vital refuge for migratory birds, including those from the Charadriiformes and Anseriformes orders. It hosts large congregations, sometimes numbering up to 100,000 individuals of BWTE (BirdLife International, 2020).All sampled individuals were from carcasses obtained from the hunting season in Cuba. The right wing of each individual was taken, and their sex (Female/Male) and age (After Hatch Year: AHY and Hatch Year: HY) were identified based on wing plumage characteristics following the methods described by Pyle (2008). The primary flight feathers were added to the feather collection at the Felipe Poey y Aloy Museum, University of Havana. For isotopic analysis, the most distal primary flight feather (P10) was selected.2.2 Stable-hydrogen isotope analysisPrimary feathers (P10; n = 276) were analyzed for δ2H at the Laboratory for Stable-Isotope Science – Advance Facility for Avian Research (LSIS-AFAR, Western University, London, Ontario, Canada). Feathers were cleaned of surface oils using a 2:1 methanol:chloroform solvent (>12h) and allowed to air dry (24h). Feather vane was clipped from the distal end of the feather and a subsample (0.35 ± 0.02 mg) packed into silver cups and crushed. Samples were loaded, simultaneously with laboratory standards, in a Uni-Prep autosampler (Eurovector, Milan, Italy), heated to 60°C and flushed with dry helium and maintained under helium pressure (Wassenaar et al., 2015). Samples were combusted using flash pyrolysis (~1,350°C) on glassy carbon, separated via a Eurovector 3000 elemental analyzer interfaced with a Thermo Delta V Plus continuous-flow isotope-ratio mass spectrometer (CF-IRMS; Thermo Instruments, Bremen, Germany). Feather δ2H values were derived using the comparative equilibration method of Wassenaar and Hobson (2003). Two keratin standards (CBS, δ2H = −197‰; KHS, δ2H = −54.1‰) were included at the beginning (n = 3, per standard) and end (n = 2, per standard) of each run (n = 38 samples per tray). All values were corrected for linear instrumental drift. At LSIS-AFAR, across-run error has been estimated to be ±2‰. All values are reported in delta (δ) notation in per mil (‰) deviations from the Vienna Mean Ocean Water standard (VSMOW).2.3 Seasons, date of migration, age and sex comparisonsThe effect of season, date of migration, sex and age on feather δ2H was investigated. We compared isotopic compositions between seasons using a Mann-Whitney test due to the non-normal distribution of the data. The result of the tests was interpreted based on the degree of evidence provided by the p-values (Muff et al., 2022). Furthermore, confidence intervals were calculated using the Monte Carlo resampling method (10,000 Iterations). Non-overlapping confidence intervals were considered as additional evidence of differences among samples.To evaluate the effect of migration date, age and sex we employed linear regression models and the Information Theoretic framework with the Akaike index corrected for small sample sizes (AICc) (Dochtermann and Jenkins, 2011). We analyzed seven models for migration and four models for the winter season. That set of models included different combinations of age, sex, and migration date effects, along with a null model, to identify the most parsimonious models (Table 1). To satisfy the assumption of data normality, we removed five extreme values from the dataset for the migration season. The ΔAICc value and the ranking relative to the null model served as evidence for the model(s) with the strongest support. In cases of model selection uncertainty, we used model averaged estimates, and we calculated 85% and 95% confidence intervals for parameter estimates. Predictive variables with 85 and 95% confidence intervals excluding zero, along with a relatively high AIC weight, were considered important (Arnold, 2010). In addition, we plotted the predicted values and 95% confidence intervals for variables in model set to visualize relationships. To assess the fit of models with stronger support, we examined residuals using graphical tools. All the analyses were conducted using the program R version 4.3.1 [R Core Team, 2023; R Project for Statistical Computing (RRID: SCR_001905)] and the Excel complement program Poptools V.3.2.3 [Hood, 2010; PopTools (RRID: SCR_022840)].Table 1 Table 1 Model selection results for models to estimate the influence of age, sex, and date of migration on stable hydrogen isotopes (δ2Hf) recorded in Blue-winged Teal wing feathers during fall migration season 2021 in the west of Cuba and winter season 2020–2021 in the center of Cuba.2.4 Banding data analysisThe transition probabilities from each breeding area to the region of Cuba were estimated using banding recovery data. These estimates were subsequently employed as prior information in the origin assignment analysis (Hobson et al., 2009). Banding data were requested from the North American Bird Banding Laboratory (BBL) (www.pwrc.usgs.gov/bbl). This database, which is freely accessible, includes capture and recapture information for thousands of bird species from 1955 to the present (Cohen et al., 2014).The transition probabilities were estimated based on Burnham’s live-recapture dead-recovery modeling framework (Cohen et al., 2014). This model utilizes encounter histories of birds that were captured, marked, released, and subsequently either recaptured, resighted, recovered, or never re-encountered. The model provides estimates for four demographic parameters: survival probability (S), live recapture probability (p), dead recovery probability (r), and transition probability between strata (Psi). The encounter histories were constructed assuming a life span of 12 years (Rohwer et al., 2020), for individuals banded during the reproductive season (May to September) and with records during the migratory and wintering season (September to April).For BWTE, the estimation of transition probabilities initially included four breeding areas in North America: Western Prairies (Alberta, Saskatchewan and Montana), Eastern Prairies (Manitoba, North and South Dakota), Upper Midwest (Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa) and Eastern Region (Ontario, Quebec, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Vermont, Maine). These breeding areas are a modification of the proposals of Szymanski and Dubovsky (2013), based on the availability of banding information and their respective contributions to different harvest areas.The delineation of populations and their distributions is a fundamental step in assessing migratory connectivity, making it important to establish breeding populations based on ecological criteria (Cohen et al., 2017). Subsequently, validation of these delineated areas was conducted utilizing population characteristics. We estimated population trajectories using the bbsBayes package (Edwards and Smith, 2021), which allows users to access breeding bird survey (BBS) data and to model annual indices and trends using hierarchical Bayesian models. We used a general additive model with a random effect of year (chains = 3, burn-in = 20,000, iterations = 10,000, thinning = 10, samples = 3,000). We used a t-distribution to model the extra-Poisson error distribution, as suggested by Edwards and Smith (2021). We modelled annual indices (1970–2018) stratified by the four regions: Western and Eastern Prairies, Upper Midwest, and Eastern. Based on the results, it was decided to consolidate the original number of breeding regions from four to three, merging the Western and Eastern Prairie regions due to their similarity. Details of these analyses can be found in Supplementary Material 1.The nine non-breeding regions corresponded to the flyways in which the recapture and recovery records were grouped in the original banding data (Canada, Pacific Migratory Flyways (MF), Central MF, Mississippi MF, Atlantic MF, and Central America) along with northern South America, the Caribbean, and Cuba (which was treated separately from the Caribbean). These nine regions satisfy the assumption that the recovery, resighting, and survival probabilities of banded individuals are uniform within the same area. This assumption is crucial for estimating transition probabilities (Cohen et al., 2014).Reports of recapture and recovery often exhibit variations among non-breeding regions, with greater irregularities observed in the Neotropics. To reduce the error in estimating these parameters, covariates of effort for ‘r’ and ‘p’ were included in the model, as suggested by Cohen et al. (2014). Effort covariates for each region were calculated based on the number of recaptures and recoveries for all Neotropical migratory duck species in the BBL database relative to the area of available habitats. Available habitats were identified as wetlands and waterbodies, extracted from the Global Land Cover Map of 2015 (Kobayashi et al., 2017). Survival probability was assumed to be constant across all regions. For the analysis, we had data on 87,567 individuals banded in the breeding study areas, including 4,369 total records of recapture or recovery 897 of which were from Cuba. All analyses were conducted using the RMark package (Laake, 2013).2.5 Estimating origin based on feather isotopic compositionA Bayesian framework was used to establish and map the area of origin of individuals sampled (Vander Zanden et al., 2014; Campbell et al., 2020). Stable-isotope values within waterfowl flight feathers are representative of the natal site for hatch-year birds and the molting site for adults, as they are grown during a synchronous post-breeding molt.We created an isotopic distribution map (isoscape) for North America, representing the expected δ2H values for BWTE feathers (δ2Hf). To accomplish this, a mean growing-season precipitation (δ2Hp) isoscape (Bowen et al., 2005; Bowen, 2024) was calibrated using the equation based on mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) feathers (Equation 1) (van Dijk et al., 2014), as no calibration data of known-origin feathers were available for this species.δ2Hf=−21.9+1.36×δ2HP(1)We estimated the likelihood that each cell (pixel) on the map represents a potential area of origin for each individual, using a normal probability density function. This function compares the individual feather δ2H value against the expected (mean) δ2Hf value at a given cell, while accounting for expected variation (i.e., calibration error and isoscape error). We used a residual standard deviation of 12.8‰ (Palumbo et al., 2019). The assignment of the area of origin was confined within the known breeding range (BirdLife International and Handbook of the Birds of the World, 2024) and the most relevant breeding area origin for Cuba based on the banding data analysis.In order to encompass all possible origins of the sample and facilitate the interpretation of probable surface maps, a hierarchical clustering approach was applied to group individuals into similar geographic regions of origin for each season. Following Campbell et al. (2020), we generated a surface similarity matrix by conducting pairwise comparisons among the probability surfaces for all individuals using the Schoener’s D-metric. Subsequently, a hierarchical clustering analysis was performed on each similarity matrix using the average method. The approximately unbiased p-values (AU) of each cluster were computed via bootstrap resampling. To determine clusters, we cut the trees at a height of 0.5.The estimated probabilities surfaces were normalized to sum to 1 and binarized by selecting cells with origin probability values exceeding 67%, corresponding to a 2:1 ratio (Van Wilgenburg and Hobson, 2011). Layers depicting the areas of probable origin for each individual were summed for each season and within each origin cluster for the season. This resulted in a representation of origin based on the number of individuals assigned to each pixel. All analyses were conducted using the isocat package version 0.2.6 (Campbell et al., 2020).2.6 Dynamics of AIV prevalenceTo comprehend the epidemiological implications of BWTE migratory connectivity in the context of Cuba, an analysis of the annual dynamics of Avian Influenza Virus (AIV) prevalence was conducted. This analysis encompassed both the molting and natal areas and the likely migratory flyways. To accomplish this, the predictive prevalence models by Kent et al. (2022) were used, which are freely accessible. Those authors provided a comprehensive spatiotemporal assessment of AIV prevalence in 30 duck species, utilizing data from two major surveillance databases in the continental United States: the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) National Wild Bird Avian Influenza Surveillance Program and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Influenza Research Database.For the analysis of the annual dynamics AIV prevalence, we worked with the average prevalence values for BWTE derived from the two aforementioned databases, covering all counties within each area of interest. With these data, a maximum and average weekly prevalence value was calculated for each area. These results are specific to the United States, as Kent et al. (2022) indicated that the data availability for Canada was insufficient to ensure robust predictions.3 ResultsThe δ2Hf composition of 278 feather samples of BWTE was measured, with 126 samples collected from the western region of Cuba during the fall migration season of 2021 and 152 from the central region of Cuba during the winter season of 2020–2021 (Table 2). The samples were fairly evenly distributed across sex and age classes for both seasons. During the winter season, the highest δ2Hf values were detected (Mean: −111.9‰, CL: −115.5‰ to −108.3‰), with strong evidence of differences compared to the migratory season (Mean: −129.5‰, CL: −135.4‰ to −123.9‰) (Mann Whitney test, U=6,425, p<0.001). Conversely, during the migration season, all sex and age classes exhibited a greater variation in values. Subsequent analyses were conducted separately for each season.Table 2 Table 2 Values of mean, standard deviation (SD) and confidence intervals (CL 95%) for Stable hydrogen isotopes (δ2Hf) for age and sex classes, recorded in Blue-winged Teal wing feathers during winter season 2020–2021 in the west of Cuba and fall migration season 2021 in the center of Cuba.During assessment of the effect of migration date, sex and age, we observed model selection uncertainty. The first two models had an equal probability of being the most parsimonious (Table 1), and five models ranked higher than the null model. Consequently, we utilized model-averaged estimates, 85% confidence intervals, and cumulative Akaike weights to identify crucial variables. Based on the model-averaged estimates and their associated 85% confidence intervals, we found that the day of migration and age were significant factors in explaining δ2Hf during the Blue-winged Teal migratory season (Table 3). The likely origins based on δ2Hf, tended to be more northerly as migration days progressed (Figure 1A). Conversely, AHY individuals exhibited more southerly origins compared to HY individuals (Figure 1B). For the winter season, the null model was among the most supported models, with a ΔAICc of less than two units, which we interpreted as no evidence of age and sex effects on the isotopic composition (Table 1).Table 3 Table 3 Model-averaged parameter estimates, associated confidence intervals (85% CL and 95% CL) and cumulative Akaike weight (ΣW) for the variables used to model stable hydrogen isotopes (δ2Hf) recorded in Blue-winged Teal wing feathers during fall migration season 2021 in Cuba.Figure 1 Figure 1 Feather stable hydrogen isotope values (δ2Hf in ‰ VSMOW) recorded in Blue-winged Teal wing feathers during fall migration season of 2021 in Cuba, as a function of day of migration (A) and age (B). Age, AHY, After Hatch Year; HY, Hatch Year. Shown are model-averaged estimates (solid blue dots and blue lines) and associated 95% confidence intervals (black lines), along with raw data (open black dots).Based on the recapture and recovery history from banding data, the transition probability of BWTE to Cuba was found to be significantly different from zero only for the Prairie breeding area (Table 4), which had the lowest value compared to other non-breeding Neotropical areas. Regarding the Upper Midwest and Eastern breeding areas, the highest transition probabilities were observed for the Mississippi Flyway and Canada. For the Prairie region, there was a notable transition probability to the Central and Mississippi Flyways.Table 4 Table 4 Transition probability estimates (error standard) between breeding and no-breeding areas for Blue-winged Teal, based on Burnham’s live-recapture dead-recovery model.The recapture probability (live) for non-breeding areas exhibited relatively low values, ranging from 0.0137 to 0.0005. Conversely, the recovery probability (dead) showed higher values for the Pacific and Atlantic flyways, followed by the Central and Mississippi flyways. Canada and the other non-breeding Neotropical areas presented lower values, between 0.0015 and 0.0035. The estimated survival probability (S) was 0.4962577 (SD=0.0015).Based on the transition probability estimated for Cuba using banding data analysis, the areas of probable origin for BWTE, as derived from isotopic composition, were constrained to the west of −95° longitude. Individuals sampled during the migratory season in western Cuba exhibited the most likely molting or natal areas in the prairie and coniferous forest regions of the United States and the prairies of Canada (Figure 2A). Conversely, individuals sampled during the winter season in central Cuba had their most likely origins in prairie areas, primarily from the United States (Figure 2B). The hierarchical clustering analysis indicated the presence of four clusters for each season (Supplementary Material 2). However, the statistical support for these clusters was moderate for the migratory season (AU=75, 77) and poor for the winter season (AU=56, 56). The clusters of individuals from the migratory season confirm a high diversity of origins, with many individuals originating from the north and several having likely origins in the southern distribution.Figure 2 Figure 2 Depiction of probable origin of Blue-winged Teal harvested in (A) western Cuba during migration season 2021 and (B) central Cuba during winter season 2020–2021. Legend number corresponds to number of individuals assigned to each pixel based on a 2:1 odds ratio. The harvest locations are indicated by red dots. Polygon outlines the breeding range of Blue-winged Teal (BirdLife International and Handbook of the Birds of the World, 2024).In the prairies of the United States, the spatiotemporal AIV prevalence pattern forecasted by Kent et al. (2022) for BWTE indicates an increase starting in August (week 32, mean positive proportion: 0.1; range: 0.05–0.16) and peaking in September (week 35, mean positive proportion: 0.18; range: 0.09–0.3). Elevated positive proportions were predicted throughout the autumn migration period, extending until December.In the U.S. segment of the Mississippi Flyway, a gradual increase in the proportion of positives was observed in August (weeks 31 to 35, mean positive proportion: 0.02 to 0.09). This region maintained relatively elevated values until March, during the spring migration, and peaked in December (week 50, mean positive proportion: 0.1; range: 004–0.23). A similar trend is observed in the Central Flyway, albeit with even higher average positive proportions and a peak in September (weeks 31 to 35, mean positive proportion: 0.03 to 0.1). These elevated values persisted until approximately mid-March.4 DiscussionIn this study, we provided a comprehensive account of migratory connectivity for a crucial species involved in AIV circulation in the Neotropical region, BWTE, including the relatively understudied area of Cuba. To achieve this, we utilized two distinct sources of information that differ in temporal and spatial scales, yet complement each other: feather isotopic values and banding data. The use of these two data in combination has been limited in Neotropical regions, primarily due to biases associated with the capture and recovery probabilities of bands specific to these areas.The utilization of information derived from banding records was made feasible by incorporating models that account for regional biases (Cohen et al., 2014). These banding data analyses were employed for the first time with regard to this species, enabling us to generate pertinent information covering its entire distribution range. Furthermore, we identified evidence of an age-related and phenological pattern in migration concerning the origins of these individuals.In the Neotropical region, surveillance efforts remain scarce, especially when compared to the comprehensive spatial, temporal, and species-specific monitoring carried out in North America (Hill et al., 2012; Bevins et al., 2014; Papp et al., 2017). However, identifying priority areas for monitoring viral evolution or viral incursion can help capitalize resources for early warning. The delineation of potential molting or natal areas and migratory routes has provided a foundation for prioritizing areas and information of interest within North America. This information is crucial for developing monitoring strategies in Cuba, and other Neotropical areas.4.1 Probable origin for Blue-winged Teal sampled in CubaThe most probable molting or natal area of individuals sampled during migration in western Cuba was extensive and located further north than those sampled in the central region of Cuba during winter. The substantial isotopic variation observed in the migratory season samples, along with strong evidence of differences from the wintering season samples, suggests a diverse range of potential origins for BWTE individuals using Cuba as a wintering or stopover site en route to the rest of the Caribbean, Central, and South America. However, during the migratory season, the probable area of origin for the samples corresponds to wetlands in the forests and prairies of the central-western United States and southern Canada, whereas during the winter season, it is confined mainly to prairie regions within the United States.Both identified areas align with the regions characterized by the highest density of breeding pairs for the species, spanning from northeastern Iowa and the Dakotas to southern Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta (Rohwer et al., 2020). In this core breeding area, BWTE was one of the most abundant duck species, while in the remaining parts of its distribution range, pairs are found at lower densities and in irregular patterns.During migration, BWTE individuals typically align their route with the migratory flyway closest to their breeding area; although there is approximately a 4.8% probability that some will cross to another flyway (Sharp, 1972; Garvon et al., 2011). The migration to wintering areas spans a duration of 6–8 weeks (Szymanski and Dubovsky, 2013). According to the analysis of Szymanski and Dubovsky (2013), a significant portion of individuals use the Central and Mississippi flyways with a smaller contingent migrating via the Pacific and Atlantic flyways. More specifically, birds originating from core breeding areas tend to follow the course of the Mississippi River Valley, ultimately reaching Mexico, Central America, and South America through Texas and Louisiana (Bellrose, 1980; Garvon et al., 2016).Our results, which draw on banding data analysis, validate the notion that individuals predominantly utilize the migratory flyway closest to their breeding grounds. Specifically, for the Prairie breeding population, the primary migratory routes align with the Central and Mississippi flyways. The relative stability that these connectivity patterns support inferences of increased risk of AIV incursion in certain areas of Cuba based on publicly available information on virus detection in wild birds in the regions of origin at least in Canada and the United States (CWHC, 2024; USDA, 2024).According to Kent et al. (2022) the prairie region of the United States, which coincides with the core breeding area of BWTE, is one of the regions with the highest incidence of AIV primarily in the months of October to November and mainly associated with the H5 subtype. These findings were exclusively derived from USDA data. However, we observed that, for birds from the Prairies, the peak starts earlier (August with peak in September). While Kent et al. (2022) focused on the U.S. region, it is likely that a similar pattern occurs in the core breeding areas of southern Canada, given their geographic continuity and shared ecoregion. Indeed, Papp et al. (2017) reported that the likelihood of a duck testing positive for AIV reached a peak in mid-August in the Prairie Provinces of Canada. On the other hand, for the U.S. segment of the Central and Mississippi Flyway, the proportion of positive cases remains relatively high until March during the spring migration. However, the elevated values observed during the spring season are likely associated with the H7 subtype (Kent et al., 2022).We determined that BWTE sampled in Cuba during a period of likely stopover of birds en route to wintering sites further south (Central and northern South America) suggests the possibility that some of the BWTE individuals that use the island as a stopover location may ultimately reach one of these two regions. The highest probability of transition for these birds was attributed to the Upper Midwest and Prairie breeding population. This aligns with the analysis of band recoveries made by Fernández-Ordóñez and Albert (2022) for birds recovered in Venezuela for BWTE and suggests a fall leapfrog migration pattern for this species.Distinctions in transition probabilities were identified between Cuba and the rest of the insular Caribbean, with the highest transition probabilities associated with the Upper Midwest and Eastern BWTE breeding areas. This suggests the presence of various migratory routes within the Caribbean. However, we are not aware of any similar connectivity pattern described for BWTE in the Caribbean and note a tendency for researchers to treat the Caribbean as a single region (Cohen et al., 2014). Possibly, the route passing through the smaller Caribbean islands connects with central and eastern regions of Cuba but remains undetected due to regional biases in band capture and reporting probabilities. This underscores the need to incorporate samples from other Cuban areas when investigating BWTE migration.4.2 Suggested patterns of the migrationWe found compelling evidence indicating that both migration date and individual age significantly influenced feather isotopic composition. Specifically, based on δ2Hf, we observed that individuals tend to exhibit a more northerly origin as the migratory season progresses. Generally, there is a decreasing trend in the AIV prevalence with lower latitudes (Munster et al., 2007; Bevins et al., 2014). This gradient is associated with environmental factors such as temperature or host population density (Papp et al., 2017), as well as the temporal dynamics of virus circulation itself, with the highest prevalence typically occurring at the onset of the autumn migration (Olsen et al., 2006; Latorre-Margalef et al., 2009).For BWTE, being among the first duck species to initiate migration, a decreased probability of infection by pathogens and parasites may result. Consequently, many individuals arrive in non-breeding regions without prior immunological experience (Garvon et al., 2016; Humphreys et al., 2020). This phenomenon would explain the species’ relatively high AIV prevalence later during the winter season in regions such as the Gulf Coast and Neotropics (Hanson et al., 2005; Ferro et al., 2010; González-Reiche et al., 2012; Hill et al., 2012). All of these findings underscore the critical importance of the initial phase of autumn migration for Cuba (Ferrer et al., 2014). During this phase, individuals tend to occupy molting areas to the south, increasing the likelihood of lacking prior immunological experience and, consequently, raising the possibility of acquiring the virus during the migration process.There was a slight indication that adult BWTE individuals sampled during migration in Cuba occupied molting areas further south in North America than juveniles. Notably, higher AIV prevalence and viral shedding have been observed in juvenile (hatch-year) individuals within wild bird populations (Hill et al., 2012; Hoye et al., 2012; Avril et al., 2016). This outcome is linked to the fact that juveniles possess an immune system lacking immunity against AIV, in contrast to adults who may have acquired it in prior exposure. For the BWTE, adult males are among the first to migrate and can become abundant on the Gulf of Mexico coasts starting in late August (Bellrose, 1980; Thurber et al., 2020). However, as of the sampling initiation date in September, no discernible temporal variation pattern was observed in the age distribution of migrants.4.3 Future lines of researchPart of our study was carried out during the winter season in the central region of Cuba, specifically in one of the country’s most significant wetlands, the Southern Sancti Spíritus Wetland (BirdLife International, 2020). This wetland stands out not only for its high concentration of BWTE but also for its recognition as a crucial area in the circulation of other viruses that utilize birds as hosts, such as West Nile virus (Pupo-Antunez et al., 2018). Nevertheless, there are other wetlands in the southern region of Cuba that are used by this species during winter. For instance, the Southern Los Palacios Wetland in the western region is noted for its remarkable richness and abundance of aquatic species (Aguilar et al., 2020). Furthermore, due to its geographical position as one of the primary entry points for migration and its proximity to poultry commercial farms (Ferrer et al., 2014; Montano et al., 2020), this area is important in terms of risk in AIV transfer between wild and domestic birds. In the future, it would be advantageous for studies to encompass additional areas like these to enhance our comprehension of the migratory connectivity of species utilizing Cuba as their winter habitat.Our establishment of migratory connectivity of BWTE using Cuba emphasizes opportunities for addressing various research issues associated with pathogen circulation (Altizer et al., 2011). Furthermore, our approach offers a pathway to scientifically reinforce risk-based surveillance solutions for early alert, prevention and control of these pathogens in Neotropical regions. The pattern of connectivity found in our study, together with knowledge of AIV infection rates at migration origin sites (Hobson et al., 2014), allows for a more accurate stratification of the risk of AIV incursion at destination and, consequently, better possibilities for risk-based planning towards resilience. The next phases of research should aim to integrate information on the infection dynamics of birds throughout their life cycle and their migratory behaviors, spanning both individual and population levels (Lebarbenchon et al., 2009; van Toor et al., 2018).Through these combined analyses, we can identify critical areas along migratory flyways, including important stopover sites, which play a pivotal role in virus transmission and its potential movement across borders. Clearly, we have demonstrated the added value of risk assessment based on migratory connectivity deduced by stable isotope studies in BWTE.Data availability statementThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation.Ethics statementEthical approval was not required for the study involving animals in accordance with the local legislation and institutional requirements because the samples utilized in this study were obtained from the carcasses of a species targeted in sport hunting.

What to know in Florida about bird flu outbreak.There has been “very constrained” testing of cows and humans, one expert said. Concerns are mounting. Dairy cattle feed at a farm near Vado, N.M., in 2017. H5N1, a bird flu virus, is spreading in U.S. cows. [ RODRIGO ABD | AP ]By Sam OgozalekTimes staffPublished June 21|Updated June 22Even as we grapple with how COVID-19 has changed everything, experts are concerned that a variant of influenza spreading in the U.S. could spark another global outbreak of illness — shuttering restaurants, offices and schools once more.H5N1, a bird flu virus, is infecting dairy cows, alarming researchers as it inches closer to humans.While cases are rising, with over 100 herds affected nationwide, scientists worry that not enough testing is being done to understand the outbreak’s full scope. Florida has yet to record a case in cows. Michigan has reported the most of any state, with infections logged in 25 herds.“Nobody wants a pandemic,” said Seema Lakdawala, a professor in the department of microbiology and immunology at Emory University. “And the more chances we give this virus, the more shots on goal it takes, the more likely we are to be in a scenario where we have H5 circulating in the human population.”Here’s what Floridians should know.What is H5N1?H5N1 is a type of influenza A. Some influenza A viruses cause the seasonal flu in humans, while others cause bird flu. First detected in farmed geese in China in 1996, H5N1 has occasionally infected humans. From 2003 to 2019, about 860 people contracted the virus, which is more contagious in birds than people, according to global data from the World Health Organization. Egypt, Indonesia and Vietnam accounted for 8 out of 10 cases during this period.A highly virulent form of H5N1 was identified in Europe four years ago, spreading to Africa, the Middle East and Asia. It resulted from wild bird and poultry flu viruses exchanging genetic material. It reached North America in late 2021.H5N1 has devastated the animal kingdom. In 2022 alone, more than 131 million poultry died from the illness or were slaughtered in attempts to contain the virus, according to case data from 67 countries. The virus has infected mammals, too, including bobcats, raccoons, red foxes and a dolphin in Florida, which died. Seals and sea lions have been hit hard, with tens of thousands killed.Beginning in late March, U.S. agriculture officials began to report infections in dairy cattle — a startling development that is raising concerns among scientists. Cases as of Tuesday have been detected in 101 herds from Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, South Dakota, Texas and Wyoming.Researchers believe the virus jumped from wild birds to cows in the Texas Panhandle sometime in December, then spread silently for months.Have there been cases in Florida?Not in cows, according to data as of Tuesday from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.But more than 500 wild birds across the state have been diagnosed with the illness since 2022, according to the federal agency. That’s likely an undercount because many birds die and aren’t found. H5N1 has reached Tampa Bay counties, infecting vultures, great horned owls and bald eagles, according to data from the department. A spokesperson for the St. Petersburg-based Fish and Wildlife Research Institute previously said the state had “likely lost tens of thousands” of native birds.Keep up with Tampa Bay’s top headlinesSubscribe to our free DayStarter newsletterWe’ll deliver the latest news and information you need to know every morning.Loading...You’re all signed up!Want more of our free, weekly newsletters in your inbox?

[ CHARLIE NEIBERGALL | AP ]Is the state testing cattle?Yes. As of early last week, the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services had tested 65 dairy cows for bird flu. Five of the animals — from three separate sites in Alachua, Gilchrist and Suwannee counties — were tested because they exhibited symptoms “that could be associated with H5N1.” All were negative, according to the department.The remaining 60 cows were tested prior to movement across state lines. Federal agriculture officials in late April required that lactating dairy cattle receive a negative influenza A test before interstate transport, though healthy animals headed directly to slaughterhouses are exempt.The state agriculture agency, for now, is not conducting random testing of dairy cows, spokesperson Aaron Keller said in an email.Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson issued emergency restrictions in mid-April that prohibit dairy cattle exposed to H5N1 from being imported into Florida.There are about 125,000 dairy cows in Florida, which collectively produce about 300 million gallons of milk per year, according to Florida Dairy Farmers, a milk promotion group.How is the virus moving between cattle?The leading hypothesis is that contaminated milk equipment is spreading H5N1 from cow to cow, said Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.The virus is often not in cow respiratory tracts, he said. It’s mostly concentrated in their milk.The main sign of infection is a decrease in milk production, he added. It’s unclear if dairy cows without symptoms can still spread infectious virus.Are people getting infected?Unlike with COVID-19 or other viruses such as the seasonal flu, H5N1 is not rapidly spreading person to person. The risk remains low for the public, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which has not seen an unusual uptick in emergency room visits for influenza.But three humans in the U.S. have been diagnosed with the ailment during the dairy cow outbreak. All were farmworkers from Michigan and Texas exposed to infected cattle.An avian influenza A H5N1 virion in 2005. [ CYNTHIA GOLDSMITH, JACKIE KATZ | AP ]What are the symptoms?The first two human cases tied to dairy cows contracted mild infections in the eye, possibly via contaminated milk splashing them. They reported conjunctivitis, or “pink eye.”But the third person, a worker in Michigan, had respiratory symptoms, including a cough without a fever, that are more typical with influenza. The patient was given an antiviral drug and the infection eased while they isolated at home.Internationally, there have been more severe outcomes with H5N1. In 2022, an adult in China died in a case linked to poultry. A 53-year-old man in Chile with a cough and sore throat was admitted to an intensive care unit last year after his condition worsened. Cambodia reported two infections in February 2023, including an 11-year-old girl who developed pneumonia and died, but testing found that the virus was different from the version sickening birds in the U.S.Why are experts so worried?The chief concern is that H5N1 will acquire mutations as it spreads in cows that allow it to transmit quickly among humans, spawning a pandemic. That could be catastrophic.From 2003 to 2019, when an older form of H5N1 circulated, about half of infected people died, according to World Health Organization data. Mild cases may have been missed, inflating the death rate.But public health experts have long feared that avian influenza might upend life as we know it — again. The 1918 flu pandemic, which killed an estimated 50 million people worldwide, is believed to have started in a bird host.“Any time a virus that normally circulates in avian species is infecting mammals, it’s getting a chance to get more adapted to mammals,” said Adalja of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.He added that the U.S. is still “partly blind” with H5N1. There has been “very constrained” testing of cows and humans, he said. Some farmers have reportedly been hesitant to pursue testing because of the potential financial fallout of identifying H5N1 in a herd.“We don’t understand how big of a problem this is,” Adalja said of the outbreak.And despite the testing requirement for some dairy cows moving across state borders, there’s no equivalent federal mandate for those being transported within a state. Lakdawala, of Emory University, said whether to require testing of cattle that don’t leave is up to state officials to decide.When asked if Florida will order testing of herds moved within the state, Keller, the Florida agriculture department spokesperson, didn’t immediately provide a comment.Is milk safe to drink?In a survey of almost 300 dairy product samples, a fifth contained fragments of the virus, according to an early analysis by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The samples were collected at stores in 17 states and included milk, cottage cheese, sour cream and yogurt. The findings suggested that many more cows were carrying H5N1 than were officially reported in federal case counts.The agency conducted further testing to see if the virus was still infectious in the products. It wasn’t.Pasteurization, a heating process that kills harmful pathogens, neutralizes the virus, the federal agency says.The Food and Drug Administration in a statement to the Tampa Bay Times said “the totality of evidence continues to indicate that the commercial milk supply is safe.”Should consumers avoid raw milk?Yes, health experts say. It remains unclear whether drinking raw milk with H5N1 will result in an infection. But federal food regulators have long warned that consuming such products is risky because they can harbor dangerous microorganisms.There are troubling signs that H5N1 in raw milk could cause illness. A study of mice found that they quickly exhibited lethargy after being given raw milk contaminated with the virus.When the mice were euthanized, scientists discovered high levels of the pathogen in their respiratory organs.Florida bars the sale of raw milk for human consumption. But raw milk labeled as pet food is found throughout the state, according to a website that tracks availability.“Absolutely do not consume raw milk products,” Lakdawala said.What about beef?Federal agriculture officials say they’re confident the meat supply is safe and that they didn’t find the virus in 30 samples of ground beef collected from states where dairy cows tested positive.In an experiment, federal Department of Agriculture researchers found that cooking hamburgers to 145 degrees (medium) and 160 degrees (well done) would kill the virus.A Jersey cow feeds in a field in Iowa in 2018. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration says the country’s commercial milk supply is safe during the H5N1 outbreak. [ CHARLIE NEIBERGALL | AP ]Is there a vaccine?It’s a bit complicated. The bottom line: you can’t walk into Walgreens or CVS this week and get a shot to ward off H5N1.But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has bird flu viruses that can be used by manufacturers to develop a vaccine, with good protection against H5N1 expected.The problem is one of logistics. If a pandemic were to begin, providing enough vaccines would be challenging.How else can individuals, and pets, stay safe?Avoid sick or dead animals, including wild birds and poultry, if you don’t have eye or respiratory protection, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Stay clear of feces from critters.Those who come into contact with sickened animals should monitor themselves for symptoms, including pink eye, for 10 days.Keep your pets, such as cats and dogs, away from sick or dead wild birds, feathers and droppings and feed and water bowls that wild birds may have touched.What’s going on with wastewater tracking?Scientists have started to monitor sewage to see where H5N1 is spreading — just like with COVID-19. WastewaterSCAN, a national surveillance network from Stanford and Emory universities, recently began to test for the H5 influenza A subtype at 194 locations across the country, including 13 in Florida.There are many H5 bird flu viruses. But if H5 is detected this summer in a treatment plant’s wastewater, it’s likely H5N1, said Alessandro Zulli, a postdoctoral scholar at Stanford who works with WastewaterSCAN.The research team has yet to find H5 in Florida wastewater, including at three St. Petersburg facilities, according to recent data. But the virus has been identified in sewage from states like Michigan and Texas.Detecting H5 doesn’t confirm that humans are infected, Zulli said. The virus could be entering wastewater systems through milk discharges at dairies, he said. Federal health authorities have urged farmers to throw out milk from sick cows.Monitoring sewage is a “very early warning system,” Zulli said.“It’s much easier to do than testing every cow in a 50-mile radius,” he said. “Or testing every person in a 50-mile radius.”Sam Ogozalek is a reporter covering the healthcare system and mental health.

What we know.Health officials are urging caution with where consumers get their milk as they investigate bird flu deaths in humans. Here's what we know.Called highly pathogenic avian influenza, the H5N1 bird flu virus making headlines in Michigan and across the U.S. got its name because it is so well adapted to infecting and killing birds. H5N1 has been circulating in the U.S. since January 2022 and globally since 2021. What has scientists and researchers worried, however, is that the virus is increasingly spilling over to infect other animals, such as seals and racoons, bobcats, foxes, cows and alpacas — and now, even humans — and how little we know about how widespread the infections actually are.Testing for H5N1 infections is voluntary. Farmers aren't required to test their cows and people with symptoms aren't required to be tested, either.There have been only three known human cases of the virus in farmworkers in the U.S. this year — two in Michigan, and one in Texas.All three had mild illness and fully recovered, but some scientists are concerned that the more the virus spreads, the greater chance it has to mutate to become better at infecting people — potentially making humans sicker and triggering an outbreak of a new, novel flu that could be reminiscent of the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic.One tool that can be used to assess how much the virus is spreading in a community is to test the wastewater.WastewaterSCAN, which is based at Stanford University, did just that. It monitors infectious diseases through wastewater systems, and, earlier this month, publicly posted the results of H5 influenza A virus testing of samples from 38 of the 50 states and the District of Columbia dating to May 21.It found that the levels H5 influenza in wastewater in Michigan were high at every site it tested, even in places where there aren't known to be infections among cattle herds, like the wastewater treatment plants in Jackson and Warren.What does wastewater testing for H5 bird flu mean?Wastewater testing for viruses often gives the first clue that there's widespread infection in a specific area. But without more precise and refined testing, samples from a wastewater treatment plant with a large catchment area don't reveal exactly where the virus is coming from or show whether it's people or cows, other creatures, (or all of them) that are infected.The virus particles detected in the wastewater could be coming from runoff from cattle farms with infected cows or other animals, discharge of untreated milk into the wastewater system from production facilities, or from the excrement of sick people.In WastewaterSCAN's testing, only six states had detections of the virus in the wastewater — California, Idaho, Iowa, Minnesota, Michigan and Texas — as of Monday. Of them all, Michigan was the only state with high levels detected at each of its six testing sites: Ann Arbor, Jackson, Jenison, Mount Pleasant, Traverse City and Warren.Even though Jackson County has yet to identify any infections among dairy cattle with the H5N1 influenza A virus, the highest number of positive wastewater samples, 10, were identified at the city of Jackson's Wastewater Treatment Plant from May 21-June 9.The city of Warren's Wastewater Treatment Plant had the second highest number of H5 influenza detections in wastewater samples statewide with five identified from May 21-June 11, but Macomb County also has no known dairy cattle outbreaks.More: Scientists try to solve bird flu mystery: Why there's so much virus in Michigan wastewaterWhat are the symptoms of bird flu?The current strain of the H5N1 virus, which is subtype 2.3.4.4b, has so far caused mild symptoms in the known human cases, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, such as eye infections, cough and nasal discharge.Following are details of the known human cases so far:A Texas farm worker who was exposed to sick cows in March contracted H5N1. The worker had only one symptom: eye redness consistent with conjunctivitis or pink eye. The person was treated with an antiviral flu drug, was asked to isolate to prevent potentially spreading the virus, and recovered. This was the first known case of cow-to-human transmission in the U.S.A Michigan farmworker exposed to cows with the H5N1 virus was splashed in the eye by untreated cow's milk. In late May, he also developed an eye infection, and completely recovered, said Dr. Natasha Bagdasarian, Michigan's chief medical executive. This was the second known case of cow-to-human transmission.A second Michigan farmworker developed upper respiratory tract symptoms, including cough without fever, and eye discomfort with watery discharge, after working closely with infected cows on a separate farm in late May. This person also fully recovered. This was the third known case of cow-to-human transmission.In April 2022, a Colorado farm worker who culled poultry suspected of being infected with the H5N1 flu virus reported feeling fatigue for several days. The person tested positive for the virus and was isolated and also treated with a flu antiviral drug. This was a case of bird-to-human transmission.How does the bird flu affect animals?The current H5N1 strain is almost always deadly in poultry, but produces a puzzling array of symptoms in other animals.In cows, this type of bird flu seems to infiltrate the mammary system. High levels of the virus have been detected in their milk, slowing production and sometimes causing thick, clotted milk. Cows get fevers, and don't eat and drink like they should. Sometimes pregnant cows miscarry.Barn cats that drank raw milk from sick cows also were infected with bird flu and developed neurological symptoms, eye and nose discharge; many died. Fox kits also have been reported to have neurologic symptoms when they get H5N1 infections, including tremors, blindness and lethargy, before they die.More: Avian flu has spread to cows, milk — and experts worry human outbreak could be nextAre my pets safe from bird flu?It depends on the pet. Of course, birds are very much at risk from the virus and can contract it through exposure to other infected birds — wild or domestic — or their feces, mucus or saliva.Cats also are extremely susceptible to the H5N1 bird flu and are at risk of developing neurological symptoms and dying. New research suggests ferrets get extremely sick, too, and can die from the virus.While dogs can get infected by the H5N1 bird flu, reports of illness among dogs are rare. When they get sick, the symptoms have been mild, the CDC reported earlier this month.Veterinarians urge pet owners to ensure their cats and dogs don't hunt birds or scavenge the carcasses of birds or other animals to avoid the risk of infection. They also should avoid contact with other infected animals, such as cows and poultry and unpasteurized milk.Is it safe to drink milk and eat eggs and beef?The studies so far conducted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration suggest pasteurized milk and dairy products are safe to eat and drink, as are fully cooked meat and eggs.In one out of 109 samples of beef tested in late May by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service, H5N1 viral particles were detected in muscle tissue. In ground beef that was inoculated with high levels of virus, cooking it to at least 145 degrees (medium) or 160 degrees (well done) killed the H5N1 virus."Even cooking burgers to 120 (rare) degrees, which is well below the recommended temperature, substantially inactivated the virus," the USDA reported.And though similar testing of commercial milk found H5N1 viral fragments, those particles were inactivated by pasteurization and were unable to cause infection. Raw milk from infected cows, however, has been shown to be a risk for infection.Will my annual flu shot protect me from this virus?While scientists are working to develop a flu vaccine that could work against the current strain of H5N1 virus, the CDC reported Friday that blood sample tests suggest Americans have "extremely low to no population immunity" to the H5N1 virus strain circulating now. Seasonal flu vaccines don't appear to have produced any antibodies to the virus.That means "most of the population would be susceptible to infection from this virus if it were to start infecting people easily and spreading from person-to-person," the CDC said.Contact Kristen Shamus: kshamus@freepress.com.

The more widespread it becomes, the more officials worry it could spread among people.Dinah Voyles Pulver USA TODAYShow Caption Hide Caption Health officials detail bird flu transmission to humans. What we know.Health officials are urging caution with where consumers get their milk as they investigate bird flu deaths in humans. Here's what we know.More than three years into a worldwide outbreak of bird flu, the virus continues to expand in the U.S., with growing impacts to food production and animals. Over 80 million chickens, thousands of wild birds and dozens of mammal species, including a polar bear, have been infected. Now it's running rampant among dairy cows, turning up in 94 herds across 12 states since March. The latest animal to test positive was an alpaca on an Idaho farm.“It's gigantic, the scope and scale of the presence of the disease,” said Julianna Lenoch, national coordinator for the Department of Agriculture’s wildlife disease program.This scale ‒ and related concerns ‒ are reflected in the price of eggs, renewed warnings to cook ground beef and eggs thoroughly, and in extraordinary measures dairy and poultry farmers are being asked to take to prevent its spread. As the outbreak lingers and expands, it’s prompting growing concerns about the risks to humans and the influence of warmer temperatures and more extreme weather events in making this and future pandemics worse.How widespread is this bird flu outbreak?The highly contagious H5N1 virus has spread to six continents since the first detections in Europe and Asia in 2020. It has been reported across North and Central America and most of South America and has been found on every continent. It turned up in Antarctica last fall raising alarm about potential consequences for some of the world's most beloved birds: penguins.Timeline: From chickens to foxes, here's how bird flu is spreading across the USThe U.S. has experienced avian influenza outbreaks in the past, but this one is lasting longer and is more widespread. Domestic poultry flocks, either in commercial operations or backyard flocks and farms, have been infected in every state except Louisiana and Hawaii, including more than 5.9 million birds just since May 1.Since 2022, infections have been reported in 14 million turkeys and 80 million chickens, including 71 million egg layers. Farmers must kill chickens and turkeys when a poultry flock tests positive, and experts say the slaughter to prevent human infection has helped drive up the cost of eggs.Infected mammals have been found in 31 states, with the greatest number of infections found in foxes, mice, striped skunks, mountain lions, cats and harbor seals.Research studies find the prolonged presence and spread of the virus increase the risk of genetic mutations that could allow it to pass more easily from animals to people and among people. “The longer we have virus out there, the more possibility there is for changes,” said Lenoch, who oversees the federal program responsible for tracking the virus in wild birds. Can humans get bird flu? Yes, but the risk in the U.S. is still very low, federal officials reiterated in a Thursday briefing. They say the public should be “alert but not alarmed.” Since it arrived during the winter of 2021-2022, four people have tested positive in the U.S. All were exposed to the virus on farms. In the first case, in 2022, the worker was helping to cull infected poultry on a farm. All three patients this year had exposure to dairy cows. Two only reported conjunctivitis, or pink eye, while the third also experienced upper respiratory symptoms. No one in the U.S. has died from the virus, according to federal officials, but deaths have been reported internationally.So far, for the general public, everything but raw milk is considered safe, federal officials say, as long as you’re cooking ground beef and eggs all the way through. Cooking takes care of any remnants of the virus that could be in egg yolks or in ground beef after once-infected dairy cows are shipped to market to be butchered. In milk, pasteurization kills the active virus so it can’t be transmitted, federal research shows. However, harmless traces of the virus remain, and are found in an estimated 20% of the nation’s milk supply. The Food and Drug Administration said it does not know if the virus can be transmitted in raw milk, but has asked states that allow the sale of raw milk to restrict it as a precautionary measure.“The fact that it’s in 20% of our milk supply should be disturbing to everyone because that means it’s gone around already,” said Xavier Becerra, U.S. Health and Human Services secretary, during a speech to the Western Governors Association last week. “If it starts to jump, that’s when we really have to worry."Why are officials concerned about human exposure to bird flu?The great concern among federal agencies and researchers is that the virus will evolve and become more contagious among humans. For now, it’s hard for humans to contract the virus and it hasn't been passed from person to person.Without stringent measures to avoid repeated viral transmission between wild and domestic animals, experts say the risks to people could grow. The Department of Agriculture and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are urging farmers to step up efforts to prevent the spread by cleaning and disinfecting equipment, especially when the same equipment is used to handle manure and feed and to better protect farm employees.Preventing farm to farm spread is “really critical,” agency officials said Thursday. How is this outbreak of avian flu different from previous ones? The outbreak is “unique in global expansion” and in the number of bird and mammal species that it’s infecting, concluded a study published earlier this year by Tufts University researchers Jonathan Runstadler and Wendy Puryear. “Though the risk to humans remains low, this unexpected outbreak well illustrates the continued need for vigilance and further study," the study stated.Avian influenza is spread globally among birds, particularly migratory waterfowl such as ducks. They’re natural reservoirs and migrate over long distances, traversing hemispheres in some cases. As they travel, infected birds shed the virus in mucus, saliva, and feces.In previous outbreaks, wild birds would often get exposed and just carry the virus around with no symptoms, Lenoch said. With the current strain that has evolved, wild birds have been getting sick and dying in large groups. The virus raises many concerns, not only because of its impacts on human health and agriculture, but also because it's killing wildlife, such as seabirds, raptors and marine mammals, said Diann Prosser, a research wildlife biologist with the U.S. Geological Survey's Eastern Ecological Science Center.The spillover into dairy cows is rare and officials aren’t certain how it started. One study released by federal officials this week said it likely started with wild birds infecting a cow in the Texas Panhandle. Cows from that herd, which weren’t showing any symptoms at the time, the report stated, were shipped to Michigan, where the virus quickly spread to other states. Investigations continue.Typically, outbreaks eventually burn themselves out as wild birds build immunity and stop spreading the virus. That’s expected to occur this time, as well, but it’s taking longer than usual.How is bird flu spreading?Scientists don't fully understand all the methods of transmission, but most involve bird poop. Wild waterfowl are the main carriers, said Maurice Pitesky, an associate professor in cooperative extension, poultry health and food safety epidemiology at the University of California Davis.The first four U.S. birds discovered with it were wild ducks taken by hunters in the Carolinas. Lenoch said the nation's duck hunters, who have their own suggested safety guidelines, have been invaluable at working with officials to get wild waterfowl tested.Pitesky listed these examples of ways the bird flu virus may be transmitted:Virus spreads from wild bird poop in farm ponds or inside buildings.It can become aerosolized and passed in the air.A group of free-roaming cats died after contracting the virus from drinking raw milk and showing neurological symptoms.Animals eat infected birds.Farm employees can track in shavings or dirt that may carry the virus from wetlands and farm fields. Farm tractors and other equipment can carry infected materials between farms.A visual guide: The bird flu outbreakCould climate change play a role in this bird flu outbreak?A key difference between this outbreak and previous ones is an increase in global average temperatures, especially since this outbreak started. Last year was the hottest year on record, and this year appears to be charting a similar course. The potential for warmer temperatures to alter the transmission of viruses and contribute to global pandemics has long been a concern to scientists studying potential links between climate change and the spread of viral outbreaks and pandemics. Prosser was a co-author on a study last fall that pointed out changing climate patterns and extreme weather events closely parallel this “unprecedented global spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza.”There's no single answer to the link between climate change and the bird flu outbreak in the U.S. and further studies are needed, she said. On one hand, flu particles could degrade more quickly in warmer conditions which would decrease its ability to spread. However if heat waves cause changes in food resources or immune stress in humans or animals, the virus might be able to spread more easily, she said.Is shrinking space for birds playing a role?The warming climate isn’t the only thing altering the environment, Pitesky said. Human encroachment on agriculture and wild landscapes may be an even bigger potential factor.Farms now increasingly are found near wild areas, especially wetlands, as agricultural areas expand and droughts dry up existing wetlands."We're producing more poultry than ever before and the more poultry we've produced, the less room for wild waterfowl, and less habitat for animals to roost and feed," Pitesky said. If these wild areas overlap with domestic poultry and cattle farms, it increases the potential for more disease transmission."In California we’ve lost 95% of our natural wetlands, primarily to agriculture,” he said. “There’s obviously benefits to that when it comes to feeding 8 billion (people)." But an unintended consequence is "waterfowl are using suboptimal habitats."Dinah Voyles Pulver covers climate and the environment for USA TODAY.

The districts of Alappuzha, Kottayam and Pathanamthitta in Kerala, where water bodies, migratory birds, fowls and integrated farms form part of the ecosystem, have reported H5N1 outbreaks in 19 places since April. However, the death of crows in large numbers in Alappuzha, and subsequent confirmation of the H5N1 virus in their carcasses have given rise to concerns that the virus could spread far and wide.How dangerous is it? Ever since it emerged in 1996, H5N1 has resulted in the mass killing of billions of wild birds as well as fowls. The virus’s jump to some 26 mammalian species, especially cattle and the now emerging proof that it can infect humans, has heightened the threat perception that H5N1 could lead to the next global pandemic. Of particular concern are the facts that herd-to-herd transmission of H5N1 is now taking place in the U.S., involving some 12 States and that the virus has been detected in raw milk and in milking machines. Human cases of bird flu 'an enormous concern': WHO According to scientists, the virus lacks changes that would make it better adapted to transmit between people and therefore, the risk to human health remains low. However, the potential for influenza viruses to rapidly evolve and the wide geographic spread of H5N1 signals that more human infections should be expected.What is the level of risk to humans? The virus seems to spread from birds/animals to humans who may be closely interacting with these, without adequate personal protection. WHO confirms human case of bird flu in India; four-year-old infected in West BengalAccording to the WHO, between 2003 and April 1, 2024, close to 900 human infections of H5N1 have been reported from 23 countries, of which, more than half were fatal. Even though the risk of human infections from H5N1 is still perceived to be low, this can change rapidly as the virus spreads to more animals, especially cows or domestic mice, which have closer contact with humans. In districts like Alappuzha where water fowls, chicken, dairy cows and humans share the same environment, the opportunities for human infections should be perceived as high. What are the symptoms of H5N1? The common symptoms of H5N1 are similar to those of influenza-A illnesses, including respiratory difficulties, fever, cough, sore throat and pneumonia, all of which can potentially worsen, especially in those who are immunocompromised or have underlying conditions. In the U.S., conjuctivitis or pink eye was the only symptom that was reported in one of the farm workers who was infected. Does India need to be concerned about the avian flu outbreak? | In Focus podcastIn April itself, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had sent out a health advisory that clinicians should consider the possibility of H5N1 infection in persons who report with respiratory illness or conjunctivitis, if they have had exposure to livestock or dead birds. Early detection and containment of the infection is important to prevent the extensive spread of the virus. As of now, in Kerala, as only the poultry has been found affected in all outbreaks, the strategy adopted for containment is the mass culling of birds within a certain radius of the reported infection. However, the incident of the mass death of crows has now changed the equation, as it is possible that the infection may have been taken by the crows beyond the current surveillance zone. Continuous surveillance by testing environmental samples — water, faecal matter of birds — as well as Influenza-like illness human samples would be necessary in designated surveillance zones. People who have livestock and birds at home are being advised to wear masks, and the antiviral Tamiflu is being prescribed as prophylaxis to people wherever H5N1 positive cases are found. What are the necessary precautions? People should avoid unprotected exposure to infected birds or animals or their contaminated environments. If at all one has been exposed to a possible H5N1-contaminated environment, they should monitor themselves for new respiratory illness symptoms, including conjunctivitis for 10 days and seek proper medical advice. It would be better to ensure that people use only pasteurised milk and poultry meat and eggs should be well-cooked to prevent any possible food-borne transmission of H5N1. Does bird flu have the potential to turn into the next pandemic?In a recent editorial, The Lancet, spoke about the need for a robust and coordinated response to H5N1. It pointed out that the concept of ‘One Health’, although often acknowledged, is rarely prioritised and operationalised.Kerala, however, has taken ‘One Health’ beyond the conceptual framework and the project is currently being implemented as part of the World Bank-aided ‘Rebuild Kerala’ project in four districts — Alappuzha, Pathanamthitta, Kottayam, and Idukki. It has established a community-based disease surveillance network, with 2.5 lakh volunteers trained in the ‘One Health’ concept in these districts, who will report any unusual events or death of animals/birds in a locality so that early warning and early preventive or control measures can be taken.

View all partners Email X (Twitter) Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger In the US, a dairy-farm worker develops itching, blood-shot eyes. In Australia, a young girl falls ill after a foreign holiday and is rushed to hospital. In Mexico, another man, already ill and bed-bound, becomes seriously unwell and dies. Each of these recent cases was caused by a different strain of influenza virus. In each case, it was an animal virus, which should not normally have turned up in humans at all. Should stories like this worry us? When stories like this hit the news (and for influenza viruses, this happens quite often), journalists write to virologists and ask: how worried are you about this one? The honest answer is that how any virologist really feels about a story depends on a lot of things, including our personalities: some of us are natural optimists, while others tend to catastrophise. But our professional background does give us an idea of what to look for in a news story about a novel virus. When you next read about a novel virus in the news yourself, these are the questions that can help you decide how much of a worry it might be. How far has it got? This is usually the first question. It’s actually really hard for a virus to adapt to growing well in a new host species. Even influenza viruses – basically bird viruses, but notorious for causing repeated human pandemics – only manage it every few decades. For a virus, crossing into people from a different animal host is a staged process. (I’m writing “people”, but it’s the same logic if you’re worried about a virus crossing between any two host species, say, bird flu adapting to spread in cattle.) Have people been exposed to the new virus and developed immune responses, but with no signs of infection? If there has been a “spillover” infection of a human (whether or not this caused serious illness), is there any sign that the virus has adapted enough to spread onwards to other people? And if the virus is now spreading among people, is that spread still at a point where it can be contained? How much do we know? Surveillance is hard work that requires resources and cooperation, but it is hugely important in understanding and controlling outbreaks. So what do we look for? Testing people for immune responses to a virus (serology) tells us who has previously been exposed. Sequencing viral genomes (from infected people or from the environment) tells us where the virus is now, but it also lets us work out how it is spreading and how it is changing. We can do this because viruses mutate quickly. Lining up the differences in their genetic sequences lets us build family trees (“phylogenetic trees”), which we can use to reconstruct how the virus got to particular places at particular times. Are we looking at one big outbreak or lots of separate outbreaks? Family trees can show us this. Looking at the changes in the virus’ genome also lets us look for any telltale signs that it is adapting to a new species – assuming we understand the virus well enough to work that out. What are we dealing with? The better we understand a virus, the more we can anticipate what it might do next. For some very well-studied viruses, like the influenza viruses, we know some of the genetic changes that are warning signs of adaptation to a new host species. What else can we look for? We worry more about viruses jumping between similar host species, because this is easier for the virus to do. Influenza that’s already in a mammal is closer to being able to infect us than influenza from a bird. We can look at likely routes of transmission – a respiratory virus is likely to spread more quickly than a virus spread through sexual contact. We can also try to guess at the outcomes of infection – viruses that cause serious disease are concerning, but in terms of spread, we also worry about less serious cases, which could lead to people spreading the virus without realising it. However, viruses are tricky things, and in practice, it’s really hard to predict what they will do. The current outbreak of H5N1 influenza A viruses in cattle is a good example of this. An influenza A virus infecting cattle and then spreading through milk were both huge surprises. And while H5N1 is known to be capable of causing very severe disease, it seems that some cattle are carrying the virus without serious illness. Experimental virology, in which animals and cell cultures are infected and studied under controlled conditions in secure laboratories, can be essential for understanding what a virus is really capable of. Could it get worse? Adapting to humans is hard for a virus, so anything that gives a virus more chances to pull this off is a concern. Sustained outbreaks are more of a risk than one-off cases. We worry more about viruses in animals with close contact with humans. H5N1 spreading in North American cattle is more worrying than H5N1 spreading in South American elephant seals. We worry about viruses taking shortcuts to adapting. For influenza viruses, this can happen in hosts like pigs that can pick up more than one virus at the same time and allow them to swap bits of their genome with each other. And we worry about people doing anything that gives a virus more chances to get used to them. Things like drinking unpasteurised milk in areas where it could carry H5N1 influenza viruses, for example. Bird flu has spread to elephant seals. antony baxter/Alamy Stock Photo What would the worst case look like? What would happen if things did get worse? Do we already have vaccines to this virus or to one very like it? Is there the capacity for making large numbers of those vaccines and distributing them to large numbers of people? Do we already have antiviral drugs? Do we know what’s needed to manage the symptoms caused by the virus effectively? Here, at least, it helps to face a virus like influenza that we’ve already been trying to fight for a long time. The spread of a new strain of influenza virus around the world is just one of many viral threats, but the H5N1 strain of the virus has been doing a lot of things recently that cause us, as virologists, to watch it with concern. While isolated cases can be devastating for the people involved, the bigger risk to society comes from viruses that spread – and H5N1 influenza is now spreading, in US cattle as well as in birds around the world. Importantly though, what it is not doing at the moment is anything that we would associate with it spreading among humans. The current mood among virologists is definitely not what it was in, for example, February 2020, when it became clear that SARS-CoV-2 was spreading uncontrollably among humans. But bird flu is doing enough concerning things at the moment to make us pay close attention to it. Hopefully, if we do that, we can all prevent things becoming a lot more worrying than they are now.

Tags vaccinesviruses University Rockefeller University An expert has answers for you about avian flu. Since it was first detected in birds in late 2021, avian flu has killed millions of poultry and infected animals that were previously thought to be immune, including dairy cows. The FDA has documented the H5N1 virus in animals in 48 states. Yet only 27 people worldwide have been infected since the outbreak began, and only four have been in the US. That suggests the risk to humans remains relatively low—for now. Why? And what early warning signs could point to an increasing risk? Stylianos Bournazos, a research associate professor in the Leonard Wagner Laboratory of Molecular Genetics and Immunology at Rockefeller University, headed by Jeffrey V. Ravetch. Bournazos and his colleagues have been tasked with a crucially important project: the development of a universal influenza vaccine that protects against every flu strain—those currently circulating and any yet to emerge. Here he explores what you need to know—and how worried you should be: Q Let’s start with the big question. How worried should we be about avian flu? A The good news is that we’ve had only four human cases in the United States—farm workers in Texas, Colorado, and Michigan. Two of them only had mild cases of conjunctivitis, or pink eye, and the other two developed a cough, sore throat, or fatigue. Thus far, it doesn’t seem transmittable from person to person. Q And the bad news? A The fact that the virus has acquired the ability to cross to different species. We’re primarily seeing cows infected. Again, largely with no or mild symptoms—but still the cows are a bit more worrying because we have a lot of animals in confined spaces near humans, and we don’t know exactly how the virus is being transmitted between the animals. We suspect it’s close contact. Q Domestic cats on farms have died from drinking raw infected milk. Can humans also get sick from ingesting animal products that contain the virus? The FDA has found fragments of H5N1 in 20% of supermarket dairy products in 17 states. A No. For humans, flu is primarily an airborne respiratory infection. It is possible to catch it by touching your eyes or nose after touching a contaminated surface or getting a contaminated liquid—like raw milk—in your eyes, but here that’s unlikely to happen outside of a farm setting. Most milk sold in stores is pasteurized, so if you and your pet drink pasteurized milk from the supermarket, you’ll be fine. Q Why haven’t more people caught it? A A lot of it comes down to biology. Birds have a type of cell receptor in their upper respiratory tract that this virus can attach to, and we don’t have that receptor. Q Do we know what made the infected dairy workers susceptible to infection? A No, we don’t. It’s possible genetic vulnerabilities or compromised immune systems were at play. We also don’t know why those cases were so mild, when others have been so severe. But a question I have is, do we really know there have been only four US cases? There could be more; if others had mild symptoms, they might not report it. We caught these cases in testing, but we’re not testing widely. We don’t even have a good grasp on how many cows are infected because there is limited testing of them as well. You’d hope after the COVID pandemic that there’d be much more surveillance and screening. Instead, we have significant gaps in information. However, scientists are doing whatever they can. They’ve analyzed the sequence of the virus and calculated when this flu jumped from birds into cows. In the US, the spillover event happened around December 2023. But the current bird flu outbreak has actually been ongoing since 2021. Q Since then, there have been 27 cases of human infection in eight countries, including 14 critical cases and seven deaths. What’s behind that high mortality rate? A One explanation is that the people who sickened or died were infected directly by an animal that carried the disease. Their bodies had no immunity to the virus, which explains why for humans, avian flu infections commonly cause more severe disease compared to human influenza strains. And yet despite its high pathogenicity, H5N1 has limited capacity to spread from these infected people to others. Normally influenza strains adapt as they move to different species, evolving functions that promote survival and transmissibility. Without those intermediary steps, H5N1 didn’t evolve, so it wasn’t able to spread between people. And, as with the US dairy workers, we also don’t know if individual susceptibilities contributed to the vulnerability of these infected people. Q So if we start seeing evolution of the virus through intermediary species, that becomes worrisome. A Exactly. If it acquires the ability to pass from other species to humans, and then from human to human, that’s very bad news. The major concern here is pigs. They are one of the few animals that can get infected by human, avian, and swine flus. If you have a pig infected with the human variety who then gets an avian version at the same time, the virus can recombine to create a new virus. A particularly bad combination would be a strain that combines the pathogenicity of avian flu with the transmissibility of human flu. The swift development of COVID vaccines played a defining role in ending that pandemic. Flu vaccines already exist. They do, and we even have avian flu vaccines available, if necessary, as well as other variants we can modify to increase our targeted vaccine stockpile. So we’re not in a situation as bad as we initially were with COVID. Q You’re trying to develop a universal flu vaccine. What are the challenges? A Due to the anatomy of the virus, we’re aiming at a moving target. Like SARS-CoV-2, the surface of an influenza virion is brimming with antigens that can evolve rapidly, giving rise to new variants that we have limited immunity against. Our antibody response to influenza is typically directed at viral proteins in a region of the antigen called the head domain, which is unique to each strain. However, there is also a region called the stalk domain that is highly conserved across diverse influenza strains, which means it’s similar in each one. Unfortunately, our immune responses only rarely aim at the stalk regions, and any responses are short-lived. So the goal is to be able to redirect our antibody responses away from the variable, strain-specific regions of the virus and get them to target these highly conserved regions, which cannot mutate very easily. If we can do that, we can target multiple variants at once, as well as provide protection against any variants that might arise in the future. Q That’s the approach the Ravetch lab is taking, correct? A It’s one of them. Based on what we’ve learned about the importance of a specific set of immune pathways that are required to elicit broadly protective immunity, we are developing and testing new vaccine candidates that use these pathways to refocus the immune response towards conserved regions of the virus. Recently, in collaboration with the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, we examined one novel vaccine that’s in Phase 1 testing. We found that its vaccine-elicited antibodies rely on interactions with these specific immune receptors to give protection, which is consistent with our previous findings. Knowing this helps us get closer to designing universal flu vaccines with maximal effect. These findings are not limited to influenza, by the way. They’re relevant for other serious viral pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2, Ebola, and HIV, as we’ve demonstrated in previous research. Q How close are we to having a universal flu vaccine available? A It’s hard to estimate, but we’re definitely getting closer. Over the past several years, there has been remarkable progress. We now know more than ever before how the virus evades host immunity, what the requirements are for eliciting universal immunity against diverse influenza strains, and how our immune system responds to infection or vaccination. When you put this new knowledge together with advancing technologies and vaccine platforms, we’re really accelerating towards a universal flu vaccine. In fact, there are several candidates in clinical development and testing. In the meantime, it’s a good idea for everyone eligible for a regular flu vaccine to get one. Q Until then, do you think we’re equipped to handle whatever may come our way with avian flu? A I’m optimistic, because after COVID, we know a lot more about how to respond to pandemics. Some governments have already been considering offering avian flu vaccines to farm workers and others with high risk of exposure to avian flu. We also have an infrastructure in place that we can rely on for developing therapeutics—and one day, we’ll have better vaccines.

It is the seventh Iowa dairy herd with a confirmed highly pathogenic avian influenza infection. Five of those are in Sioux County, which has the most dairy cows of any Iowa county, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data. Infected herds are not culled like poultry flocks. While the virus is often fatal to domestic birds, affected cows typically recover within two weeks. Dairies suffer a temporary loss of production because the milk of sick cows — which contains large amounts of the virus — is discarded. Investigations are ongoing to determine how the virus arrived in northwest Iowa, said Don McDowell, an IDALS spokesperson. O’Brien and Plymouth Counties also have infected herds. The virus is believed to have infected cows in Texas as early as December and spread to other states via the transportation of sick cows. It is likely spread locally by people and equipment that move between farms. The virus has been identified in more than 100 herds in 12 states since late March, according to USDA data. The avian flu variant that has been infecting cows was first discovered in Iowa in late May in a flock of 4.2 million egg-laying chickens in Sioux County. About a week later on June 5, testing confirmed the virus had infected an O’Brien County dairy herd. Agriculture officials have implored dairies to increase their biosecurity measures and to limit visitors. The virus has been shown to transfer from dairy herds to poultry flocks and, in a few cases, it has infected people who work closely with sick animals. Here is a timeline of highly pathogenic avian influenza infection reports in Iowa herds and flocks this year: May 28: A commercial egg-laying chicken flock in Sioux County with about 4.2 million birds. June 2: A commercial turkey flock in Cherokee County with about 103,000 birds. June 5: A dairy herd in O’Brien County with about 4,500 cattle.

An outbreak of bird flu is affecting dairy cows in the U.S. In the latest interstate bird flu outbreak among dairy cattle and poultry, Michigan is reporting the highest number of cases in the country among herds and people.Officials warn the virus is likely spreading through a variety of pathways, including people and vehicles.To date, bird flu has impacted 25 dairy herds and nearly seven million birds in the state since January, according to the U.S Department of Agriculture. In addition, two Michigan dairy farmworkers also tested positive for the virus following exposure to infected cows.Public health experts are concerned that the outbreak may be more prevalent.“We don’t know how more widespread it is,” said Arnold Monto, emeritus professor of epidemiology and global public health at the University of Michigan and co-director of the Michigan Center for Respiratory Virus Research and Response.“I think one of the reasons why we think we have so much in Michigan is that we’re testing more than most other states.”The highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus outbreak was initially identified in Texas earlier this year. According to a recent analysis by the USDA, dairy cattle from an affected herd in Texas were subsequently transported to Michigan, arriving in the state on March 8.Since then, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports at least 45 people have been tested for bird flu, and 550 people have been surveyed for symptoms across the U.S.“Based on the epidemiological findings, the majority of links between affected dairy premises, and between dairy and poultry premises, are indirect from shared people, vehicles, and equipment,” stated the USDA report.The USDA’s investigation found a shared factor between affected dairy herds and poultry flock could be farmworkers who work at multiple affected facilities and share housing with other workers.The report also found most affected dairy sites use shared vehicles to transport livestock without cleaning before use and that many dairy farms have frequent visitors that could also contribute to transmission spread.But the verdict is still out on how exactly the virus is moving from farmworkers to animals.“They think the transmission may be handling or equipment going from udder-to-udder and not the way flu is traditionally transmitted through respiratory,” said Monto. “But we are not sure because there are some cattle that have had respiratory symptoms.”USDA recommends enhanced biosecurity measures, limiting in-state animal movement and increased testing for livestock to reduce spread of the virus, which has recently been found to exist outside of farm facilities.In the last couple of months, traces of the virus have begun showing up in wastewater across several Michigan cities including in Jackson and Mount Pleasant according to recent wastewater data.Even though avian influenza has been identified in wastewater, its presence doesn’t necessarily mean an area is experiencing an outbreak, according to the CDC, because the monitoring methods aren’t yet able to identify what subtype of bird flu is being detected in wastewater.“Wastewater in Warren is showing positive H5 (avian influenza) and one piece of genetic material from H5N1 (current avian flu outbreak virus),” said Monto. “All this really means is that we’ve got to have more testing and try to get to the bottom of the transmission.”Currently the state of Michigan is awarding $28,000 grants to 20 dairy farms impacted by bird flu to participate in research related to the recent outbreak.Trusted, accurate, up-to-date.WDET strives to make our journalism accessible to everyone.

As a result, their body will exhibit a stronger immune response for newer influenza B variants that share similar characteristics with strains that were circulating during their first 5 to 10 years of life. The research provides strong immunological evidence to support previous epidemiological studies which found differences in susceptibility and severity of influenza infections based on year of birth. Researchers analysed more than 1,400 serological samples collected from individuals born in Australia and the United States between 1917 and 2008. They measured the antibodies present in the samples and compared them to the IBV strains circulating globally between 1940 and 2021. “Using this comprehensive dataset, we discovered that the highest concentrations of antibodies in each sample generally corresponded with the dominant strain of influenza B virus that was circulating during that individual’s childhood,” says first author Peta Edler, a research assistant in biostatistics at the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity at Australia’s University of Melbourne. “Essentially, when it comes to influenza B virus infections, first impressions matter. The initial, early-life exposure to the virus appears to influence how the immune system responds to future influenza B viruses.” Influenza B viruses belong to either the B/Yamagata or B/Victoria lineages. They account for a substantial proportion of annual influenza cases and are the prominent circulating subtype of influenza every 4 to 5 years.

CNN — The United States’ response to H5N1 – “bird flu” – has taken too long, showing how risky gaps in coordination and trust can be. With three cases reported in people in the United States and clusters in cattle herds from Michigan to Texas, Idaho to North Carolina, it’s clear that the virus is widespread among animals. To protect people, animals, and our economy and to restore trust in public health, we need to get this right. We’ve seen H5N1 coming for more than 20 years. Although the challenge was smaller because of it size, Finland stopped H5N1 in animals before it spread to humans last summer. This story, among a half dozen outbreaks that never made headlines, is featured in our new Epidemics That Didn’t Happen report. The U.S. has done a lot, including scaling up test production, evaluating vaccines, tracking wastewater for related viruses, and providing information about efforts. Finland did three things particularly well; all are relevant to the U.S. response to the virus. Rapid response. Within 24 hours of the first cases being reported on a mink farm, Finland confirmed that the animals tested positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1, which was known to be circulating among birds in Finland, just at the virus has been circulating among birds in the U.S. for the past two years. Human and animal health specialists worked together immediately to track infections, including testing at-risk workers on farms with infected animals. Dead birds are collected along the coast in the Vadso municipality of Finnmark in Norway following a major outbreak of bird flu on July 20, 2023. Oyvind Zahl Arntzen/NTB/AFP/Getty Images Related article Bird flu is rampant in animals. Humans ignore it at our own peril In the United States, H5N1 has been spreading among cattle since at least late last year. Even today, the United States doesn’t know the extent of spread among animals or humans due to insufficient testing and tracking. The 7-1-7 target for outbreak detection and response should be our guiding principle: seven days to detect a suspected infectious disease outbreak, one day to notify public health authorities, and seven days to complete the initial response. This approach can halt outbreaks before they spread. Finland’s response met this target. In the U.S., instead of 7 days, the time from emergence of H5N1 in cattle to detection was more like 100 days, and it’s not clear we’ve met the 7-day target for initial response even months into the outbreak. Doing so requires communication and public health measures in the affected communities and an effective coordination mechanism. We must improve the connection of human and animal health and strengthen animal public health. Trust. Farmers already had a high level of trust in the Finnish Food Authority after years of successful programs, and had launched a surveillance program that resulted in rapid notification of unusual symptoms among their animals. Farmers were immediately reimbursed for the value of animals that needed to be culled to stop disease spread, strengthening trust of the government in the farming community. This trust will no doubt help Finland’s next move: vaccinating frontline workers against H5N1. They are the first country to do so. Trust toward the United States government is low, especially among rural Americans who are on the front line of these outbreaks. In May, the US Department of Agriculture announced payments to farms to help stem spread in dairy cattle, including covering veterinary expenses for cattle testing positive for H5N1, compensating farms that supply personal protective equipment to their workers, and paying farm workers to participate in USDA and CDC studies. We may need to do more to protect our nation’s agricultural sector. The US Department of Agriculture is ordering dairy producers to test cows that produce milk for infections from highly pathogenic avian influenza before animals are transported to a different state. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images/File Coordinated government response. Human health and agriculture officials in Finland coordinated closely, paving the way for a rapid, effective response. The joint response strengthened detection, collaboration of industry groups, and protection of workers from infection. Finland rapidly passed new legislation to ensure it had the authority to implement effective control measures.

In the United States, government agencies have had rocky relationships given varying priorities, legal authorities, agility and politics. There are multiple agencies involved: USDA monitors cattle health, US Food and Drug Administration monitors milk safety and the CDC monitors diseases in humans, including from animal exposure. Coordination seems to be improving, but any directives from the government should be crafted to the specific needs of each community; national mandates will likely not be practical given our country’s size and diversity. We have a lot to learn, and no time to lose. First, localities, states and national authorities must work with one another. This will require multiple federal agencies – including CDC, USDA, FDA – and their state counterparts to share information transparently and in real time with each other and with the public. Second, Congress needs to provide resources to prevent and respond to pandemic risks, including for systems, workforce, and infrastructure so we’re prepared to stop new events before they become epidemics. Third and perhaps most importantly, we must quickly build relationships with farm owners and workers by being responsive to their needs and addressing their questions and concerns. If one country responds to H5N1 well, that’s not enough. Microbes know no borders. Every country – including the United States – needs an effective response. My organization’s latest Epidemics That Didn’t Happen report highlights how countries with responsive health systems prevent outbreaks from becoming epidemics through careful planning, early detection, and swift action.

Photograph: Ernesto Benavides/AFP/Getty ImagesBird flu This article is more than 4 months oldBird flu pandemic risk rises as cow cases appear and officials warn of humans’ roleThis article is more than 4 months oldUSDA report finds transmission likely happening when workers, cows, vehicles and equipment go to multiple farmsMelody SchreiberWed 19 Jun 2024 12.00 BSTLast modified on Wed 26 Jun 2024 19.11 BSTShareBird flu cases among animals continue to rise as US officials warn about the role of humans in spreading the virus.There are now 102 herds in the US with H5N1 cases, though given the prevalence of inactivated virus in commercially available pasteurized milk, experts believe the true number may be even higher.Poultry operations have reported cases likely linked to dairy farms, indicating the virus may be spilling back from cows into birds. Nearly 97m domesticated birds in the US have been affected by the highly pathogenic influenza since 2022.Although officials believe this outbreak was originally sparked by a single introduction from migratory birds into cows – for instance, via feed contaminated by bird feces – late last year, genomic analyses now suggest it is being spread between animals and farms by human activity, according a report released by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) on Thursday.The report, which focused on cases in Michigan, found that transmission is likely happening when workers, cows, vehicles and equipment go to multiple farms.Among employees at dairies with outbreaks, one in five employees work at other dairies and 7% work on poultry operations as well. That’s in addition to the veterinarians, nutritionists and haulers who regularly visit multiple farms.Three in five Michigan dairies with outbreaks use shared vehicles to transport cows, but only 12% clean the vehicles first. All but one of the affected dairies belong to the same milk co-ops.The results are in line with a second report also released by the USDA on Thursday, showing that about one-third of employees at US dairies with outbreaks also work on other farms with livestock – usually dairy farms, but sometimes swine and poultry.Top CDC officials warns US needs ‘more tests’ in face of bird flu fearsRead moreMore than half of affected dairy farms across the US share trucks and trailers to transport cows, and more than half of those who share vehicles don’t clean them first, the report said.“Biosecurity is the key to prevention,” Kammy Johnson, a veterinary epidemiologist with the USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, told reporters on Thursday. That means decontaminating everything that goes from farm to farm – transportation, clothing, equipment – and reducing the chances of infected animals, or people, passing the virus onward.It’s not clear if the outbreak is continuing to gain force, officials said, but they expect to find more cases in cows.And, as the virus evolves, it could become more of a threat to people, according to a recent report by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Officials expect to see more bird flu cases among humans as the outbreak continues, the report said.“The more infections there are among cows, the more risk there is for infections to occur among humans,” Dr Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the CDC, told reporters on Thursday.“The fact that it’s in 20% of our milk supply should be disturbing to everyone because that means it’s gone around already,” Xavier Becerra, secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, said last week. “If it starts to jump, that’s when we really have to worry.”Yet testing has lagged, in a situation reminiscent of the Covid-19 pandemic.The only authorized test for H5N1 among humans comes from the CDC, and it is only available to people who have symptoms and a history of close contact with infected animals or other people. So far, there have only been 45 tests performed this year.Yet there have been reports of workers with positive flu A tests that are not sequenced for H5N1, as well as potential missed cases, like the farm workers and a local maternity worker who reported flu-like symptoms near the first confirmed human case this year in Texas.Providers may now be reluctant to test for influenza even if a patient has respiratory symptoms, since the flu season has ended and thus insurance companies may not pay for the tests.The USDA requires lactating dairy cows to be tested before moving across state borders. The federal government does not have the authority to require testing of animals or people on a wide scale, which means these efforts largely fall to state and local entities.In Wisconsin, for instance, which has not yet announced any infections in cows, farmers are now required to test cows before taking them to fairs and exhibits.Cows have died in at least five states – South Dakota, Michigan, Colorado, Ohio and Texas – because they didn’t recover or developed secondary infections after testing positive for H5N1. The majority of infected cows recover, but these deaths indicate the potential financial burden of an uncontrolled outbreak.Barn cats and mice have also tested positive for H5N1, raising concerns the animals could spread the virus in communities beyond the farms. This article was amended on 20 June 2024. Barn cats and mice tested positive for H5N1, not H1N1 as an earlier version said.Explore more on these topicsBird fluHealthFarm animalsInfectious diseasesAnimalsnewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveTax strategyFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInXNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

(dcr)Seventh dairy is hit with bird flu, the Iowa ag department saysSkip to main content HomeNewsPoliticsSportsThings To DoBusinessMetro NewsOpinionObituariesAbout UseNewspaperWeatherAdvertise with UsArchivesCrosswordsComicsNewslettersConnect With UsIowa CaucusesContributor Content Bird flu infects seventh Iowa dairy farm, state agency saysDonnelle Eller Des Moines RegisterAnother dairy herd infected with highly pathogenic avian influenza has been reported in Sioux County, making it the fifth such outbreak in the northwest Iowa county.The Iowa Department of Agriculture said Monday that bird flu, known as H5N1, was reported in a Sioux County herd with 10,000 cows. It's the seventh outbreak in a dairy herd in Iowa since the first case was reported earlier in June.The virus is deadly to chickens, turkeys and other poultry, and flocks where it is detected are destroyed to contain the virus. So far, however, the effects on dairy cows have been limited to symptoms like reduced appetite and milk production, and they are able to recover with supportive care.Here's what to know about the H5N1, which has plagued Iowa and the nation's poultry industry since 2022 and began showing up in dairy herds in March.Where have H5N1 outbreaks occurred in Iowa dairy herds, in addition to Sioux County?The state’s first H5N1 case on a dairy farm was reported June 5 in a 4,500-cow herd in O’Brien County, followed by a June 7 outbreak a 250-cow herd in Sioux County.The Iowa agriculture department reported another in Sioux County on Wednesday in a 1,700-cow herd, followed Friday by one in a 1,000-cow herd there. Also Friday, an outbreak showed up in a 3,000-cow herd in Plymouth County.The fourth Sioux County detection came Saturday, in a 520-cow herd. Sioux, O'Brien and Plymouth counties share borders in dairy-heavy far northwest Iowa.How many states and dairy herds have been infected with H5N1?About 100 herds in 12 states have experienced outbreaks since March, when the virus spread from birds to cattle. The first detection in a dairy herd, confirmed with the help of the Iowa State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, was in Texas.Can people get bird flu?Yes, but the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say the risk is low. Three U.S. dairy workers who were in contact with infected cows have been diagnosed with mild cases of bird flu. Mexico recently reported that the first human bird flu death in the current wave of infections occurred there April 24, according to the World Health Organization.Is the U.S. food supply safe?Federal officials say only milk from healthy animals is allowed in the food chain. Most U.S. milk is pasteurized to kill harmful bacteria and viruses, and dairy products in any food sold in interstate commerce must be receive the treatment. Some states, including Iowa, allow the sale of unpasteurized milk, but only via direct sales from small farms. The federal government has warned consumers against it use.Have Iowa poultry flocks been hit with highly pathogenic avian influenza?Iowa has had two outbreaks so far this year. Since 2022, the virus has hit 53 commercial and backyard flocks in the state, resulting in the deaths of about 23.3 million birds. Iowa is the nation’s largest egg producer and seventh-largest turkey producer.How is the virus spread?It is believed to be carried by migrating wild birds, which have infected domestic flocks.The U.S. Department of Agriculture said last week the spread of H5N1 among dairy cows is believed to be linked to the movement of cattle between states, although wild birds haven't been ruled out as carriers. The agency also suggests that farms where infections have been detected may have shared equipment, workers or service personnel.Can livestock and poultry be vaccinated against bird flu?Yes, but there are a number of technical problems associated with vaccination. Because the vaccine can mask symptoms in infected birds, other countries would likely ban U.S. poultry imports, costing producers an estimated $24 billion and axing 215,000 poultry jobs, an analysis shows. In addition, vaccinating hundreds of millions of chickens, turkeys and other poultry — potentially more than once — is a costly and practical challenge. Plus, researchers still are trying to determine how effective vaccines would be.Donnelle Eller covers agriculture, the environment and energy for the Register.

The current H5N1 strain is almost always deadly in poultry, but produces a puzzling array of symptoms in other animals — including those commonly kept as pets, especially cats.Cats are extremely susceptible to the H5N1 bird flu and are at risk of developing neurological symptoms and dying. Barn cats that drank raw milk from sick cows also were infected with bird flu and developed neurological symptoms, eye and nose discharge; many died.New research suggests ferrets get extremely sick, too, and can die from the virus.While dogs can get infected by the H5N1 bird flu, reports of illness among dogs are rare. When they get sick, the symptoms have been mild, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported earlier this month.Veterinarians urge pet owners to ensure their cats and dogs don't hunt birds or scavenge the carcasses of birds or other animals to avoid the risk of infection. They also should avoid contact with other infected animals, such as cows and poultry and unpasteurized milk.Here are some tips from the World Organisation for Animal Health to protect your pets — especially cats — from the bird flu:Where possible, avoid direct contact with sick poultry, fallenwild birds, objects with traces of bird droppings, or surfaces orwater sources (e.g.: ponds, troughs, lakes) that might becontaminated with saliva, feces, or bodily fluids from birds.Upon returning home, ensure that your shoes are kept out ofreach of pets.After coming home from outdoor areas that may have birddroppings, clean your shoes.Disinfect the surface where you placed your shoes.Follow regular hygiene practices, such as washing hands withwarm water and soap, particularly after returning home andbefore handling food.Maintain hygienic conditions while preparing meals.Avoid feeding pets raw poultry meat, particularly if avianinfluenza outbreaks are reported in the region.

This announcement comes almost a year after MIWG, along with partner organisations such as the Malaysian Society of Geriatric Medicine, the Academy of Family Physicians of Malaysia and 30 other organisations, initiated a petition requesting government-funded influenza vaccinations for our senior citizens, who are particularly vulnerable to influenza-related complications. This is important as older persons experience a decline of immunity as they age and, unlike healthy adults, often do not show regular symptoms when infected by influenza. Instead, they can experience other symptoms such as a decline in overall health, increased risk of injuries due to falls and others. For those who are unaware, influenza is more serious than a cold â it is not âjust the fluâ but can be deadly. While everyone, including young and healthy people, is at risk of contracting influenza, it often takes a heavier toll on older adults. It takes only one infection to increase the risk of heart attack by 10 times and stroke, caused by a blood clot, by eight times. Older persons are also more likely to experience complications such as pneumonia, inflammation of the heart and sepsis. These illnesses often require hospitalisation and may lead to death. Up to 70% of influenza-related hospitalisations and 85% of influenza-related deaths occur among those 65 years and above. Furthermore, the risk of influenza-related deaths increases with the presence of more than one non-communicable disease (NCD), which is the case with many of our older adults. This risk of influenza-related death increases by 20 times for those with heart and pulmonary disease, five times for those with heart diseases, and three times for those with diabetes. In addition, influenza infection can worsen or complicate NCD symptoms such as exacerbation of diabetic symptoms, causing fluctuations in glucose levels. These manifold risks are well acknowledged, resulting in many countries, including Thailand, Laos, the Philippines and Singapore, already offering free influenza vaccines to older persons. Tackling ongoing risks While we look forward to this on our shores, I urge Malaysians to take action sooner rather than later to protect themselves and their loved ones against influenza as the virus circulates year-round in tropical climates like ours. The threat, therefore, is always present. Southeast Asia is ranked third highest in influenza-related deaths but only 2-3% of Malaysians are vaccinated against influenza. The influenza vaccine has been around for close to 80 years, since 1945, with extensive research supporting its safety records. Protecting ourselves and our loved ones with a simple annual shot can help reduce severe illnesses and complications, the cost of treatment and management as well as the corresponding burden on our healthcare practitioners and resources. Most importantly, influenza vaccinations can help save lives. Heightened awareness needed Although the influenza vaccine is well-established in many parts of the world, a recent Ipsos survey in Malaysia involving around 600 respondents aged 65 years and older highlighted that more education is needed to dispel common fears and misconceptions. For example, 52% of respondents still feel that influenza is only a concern in cold climates, and though 70% were aware that it can be prevented through vaccination, 64% were concerned about serious side effects, with 28% believing the misconception that the influenza vaccine is not suitable for people their age. In addition, 69% believe they were already protected through the Covid-19 vaccine. With such thoughts prevalent, it is hardly surprising that vaccination ranked a lowly eighth place in self-care practices. Moving towards better vaccine coverage Malaysia is moving towards becoming one of the aged countries by 2030, with 15.3% of our population being 60 years old and above, and hence, the burden of influenza on our older persons is a public health concern that we can no longer afford to ignore. To set the foundation for a successful vaccination programme, more intensive educational campaigns are needed, strategically designed to address these misconceptions and alleviate their concerns. We must acknowledge that awareness is important at all levels, involving government and non-government stakeholders, healthcare professionals and communities, to change perceptions and encourage action. As frontliners who witness first-hand the effects of heightened risk and complications from influenza among older adults, I call upon the entire community of healthcare professionals to continue acting as advocates and playing an active role in educating and encouraging yearly influenza vaccination, especially among this vulnerable population.

A few vaccine manufacturers including Pfizer-BioNTech, Novavax, and Moderna all have investigational, combination COVID-19-influenza vaccines in development. Earlier this month, Moderna reported phase 3 trial data on its mRNA-1083 combination vaccine.Moderna’s Phase 3 DataThis late-stage trial is a randomized, observer-blind, active control study evaluating the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of mRNA-1083 in two independent age group cohorts of approximately 4000 adults each. One cohort, consisting of adults 65 years and older, compared mRNA-1083 to co-administered Fluzone HD, an enhanced influenza vaccine, and Spikevax, Moderna's currently licensed COVID-19 vaccine.1The other cohort of adults 50 to 64 years of age compared mRNA-1083 to co-administered, Fluarix, a standard dose influenza vaccine, and Spikevax. The immune responses from a single dose of mRNA-1083 were found to be non-inferior versus the co-administered, routinely recommended, licensed comparators.1In both age cohorts, the Moderna vaccine also elicited statistically significantly higher immune responses against 3 influenza virus strains (H1N1, H3N2, and B/Victoria) and against SARS-CoV-2. In the 65 years and older cohort, overall Geometric Mean Ratios (GMRs) of the mRNA-1083 group compared to the Fluzone HD group for the influenza strains were 1.155 (95% CI: 1.094, 1.220) for A/H1N1, 1.063 (95% CI: 1.007, 1.122) for A/H3N2 and 1.118 (95% CI: 1.070, 1.167) for B/Victoria. The GMR of mRNA-1083 compared to Spikevax for the SARS-CoV-2 variant Omicron XBB.1.5 was 1.641 (95% CI: 1.526, 1.765).1In the 50 to 64 years of age cohort the GMRs of the mRNA-1083 group compared to the Fluarix group for the influenza virus strains were 1.414 (95% CI: 1.333, 1.500) for A/H1N1, 1.380 (95% CI: 1.310, 1.454) for A/H3N2, and 1.216 (95% CI: 1.163, 1.270) for B/Victoria. The GMR of mRNA-1083 compared to Spikevax for the SARS-CoV-2 variant Omicron XBB15 was 1.308 (95% CI: 1.219, 1.404).1Learn more: Special Report: Clinical Insights on Moderna's RSV VaccineViability of Combination VaccinesAlthough there are no FDA approved combination respiratory vaccines yet, the manufacturers are working towards it. And in thinking about vaccines historically, James Mansi, PhD, vice president of Medical Affairs, North America, Moderna reminds everyone that combination vaccines for the pediatric population are already being utilized. “When we look at pediatrics, the number of vaccines that a young infant receives in those pivotal and formative early years of life are mostly all combination vaccines,” said Mansi. “It's recognized that the more that we can give in 1 injection—facilitates the acceptability, the ease of administration, and the feasibility of ensuring that those individuals maintain compliance with vaccination recommendations.”Will RSV Protection be Included?Moderna’s RSV vaccine was just FDA approved recently and theoretically leads to the question of including protection against this virus in their COVID-19-influenza combination vaccine. Seniors are some of the most vulnerable patient populations when it comes to respiratory viruses, so the potential to get immunized for multiple respiratory viruses with 1 vaccine can be attractive to both clinicians and the general public. For Moderna, inclusion of RSV protection is not yet included in their plan, explains Mansi, but he does leave open the door for its potential inclusion in future combination vaccines.“I think it's too soon to tell for RSV—should it be included in the annual COVID-influenza vaccine—but the opportunity does exist,” Mansi stated. “And we are exploring other combination vaccines for exactly this reason to facilitate the acceptability, the feasibility, and ultimately raise vaccination rates within this adult population and throughout the age range as well.”ReferenceParkinson J.

In Michigan, over 6 million birds have been impacted by the disease at 25 farms in 10 counties. “We understand our dairy farmers are facing unprecedented challenges, and this action is an important step toward supporting them during this emergency,” Tim Boring, director of the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, said in a statement.Sponsor Recently, a second Michigan farmworker was infected with the avian flu, H5N, after working closely with cows that were infected with flu, which is also known as Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI). Related:Nation’s third human bird flu case detected in MichiganWhy Michigan cows may hold key to stopping bird flu spreadMichigan farmers must step up bird flu fight under new emergency orderThere have been three total human cases of the bird flu this year, the other in Texas. The disease has also been found in other mammals.Bird flu can be fatal to domestic poultry flocks, and once the disease has been detected, farmers are required to “depopulate” or kill the infected birds to prevent the disease from spreading further, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.It wasn’t immediately clear Tuesday how many chickens have been killed in Michigan because of the disease.Sponsor Up to 20 farms can receive the assistance. But the farms have to work with state and federal officials and participate in epidemiological investigation and studies. The U.S. Department of Agriculture already provides funding to farmers impacted by the bird flu, but the state’s assistance will be immediate, according to the press release. Boring said the research provided through the package “will help us advance science in real-time to best develop our continued rapid response.” Related Articles: Opinion | To stop bird flu, Michigan must protect farmworkers July 8, 2024 | Kristina Fullerton Rico, William D.

As a first interim result, not only the US isolate but also a recent H5N1 virus from a wild bird in Germany was able to multiply very well in the udder. Following direct infection of the udder through the teats, the dairy cows in both cases showed clear signs of disease such as a sharp drop in milk production, changes in milk consistency and fever. The FLI's risk assessment for avian influenza, including recommended measures, is not affected by this interim result, as the possibility of infection with other HPAIV H5 strains has already been taken into account in the current version of the assessment. Both the risk of the US HPAI H5N1 strain (B3.13) entering German cattle herds, including dairy farms, and the risk of cattle becoming infected with HPAI H5 viruses circulating in Europe are considered to be very low for Germany. Nevertheless, increased vigilance is recommended and HPAI H5 should also be considered in investigations, especially in the case of unclear and frequent cases of disease in dairy herds. In contrast to the USA, there is no evidence of similar cases of HPAIV H5N1 infection in Germany or other countries worldwide.Direct infection of the udder by the virus seems to be of particular importance. Since the first detection of the pathogen 27 years ago in many countries, particularly in Asia, there has been possible contact of ruminants such as water buffalo and cattle with the faeces of infected wild birds, but no similar infection events have ever been observed. The exact circumstances that led to the outbreak in the USA are still unknown.As a precautionary measure, the FLI has already tested around 1,400 bovine serum samples from cows from regions in Germany particularly affected by avian influenza for antibodies and around 350 tank milk samples from different regions for virus genomes using PCR, with negative results in each case. Further analyses of tank milk samples up to a total of around 1500 will follow.Once the FLI infection study has been completed and analysed, the results will be published. The timing cannot be estimated at this stage, but the FLI will provide information in due course.

He stressed that only a handful of farms had so far been affected, and that there was no imminent risk to the nation’s egg supply. In recent days, experts have denied that there is any truth to outlandish claims about the outbreak being made on social media, reported SBS.As of June 17, Agriculture Victoria confirms there have been seven HPAI outbreaks in the state’s poultry. Confirmed since June 12, the two latest outbreaks both involve the H7N3 virus serotype, and occurred on farms in the municipality of Golden Plains Shire. The first affected a commercial premises with ducks — the first to involve birds other than hens/pullets — and the most recent was another egg farm. These bring to seven the total number of HPAI outbreaks in Australia since mid-May. All have been located in Victoria. The H7N3 virus variant has been detected at six of these premises, all in Golden Plains. To date, the H7N9 serotype has been identified at just one farm, located further west in the state. Avian flu developments in Asian poultryIn the Philippines, the number of regions reporting HPAI outbreaks within the last 90 days remains at six, according to the Department of Agriculture's Bureau of Animal Industry. Just one outbreak is described as “on-going.” It involves a commercial quail flock in the Central Luzon region.According to the latest official notification to the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH), authorities in Japan report that movement restrictions have been lifted in connection with the most recent outbreak in poultry. During the second week of March, presence of the H5N1 HPAI virus serotype was detected in a flock of more than 57,000 laying hens in central Honshu. It was the 11th HPAI outbreak in Japan since November of last year.According to separate WOAH notifications, 21 wild birds in Japan tested positive for the same virus variant during the month of April, and two more for the H5N5 virus group. 3 more human cases of influenza linked to birdsIn the Western Pacific region, the World Health Organization (WHO) was informed of three further human infections with the avian influenza A viruses during the second week of June. All three cases were in mainland China.Of the two latest cases to test positive for the influenza A(H9N2) virus, the most recent was in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region with symptoms starting on May 2. This brought the region’s total cases to 101, including two deaths, since 2015. Of these cases, 98 have been reported in China.The following week, the influenza A(H5N6) virus was detected in a patient in Quanzhou in Fujian province. Of the 92 cases in the region linked to this virus variant since 2014, 37 have died, according to WHO.

The World Health Organization considers the virus a public health concern because of its potential to cause a pandemic, yet the U.S. has tested only about 45 people across the country. "We're flying blind," said Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at the Brown University School of Public Health. With so few tests run, she said, it's impossible to know how many farmworkers have been infected, or how serious the disease is. A lack of testing means the country might not notice if the virus begins to spread between people — the gateway to another pandemic. "We'd like to be doing more testing. There's no doubt about that," said Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC's bird flu test is the only one the Food and Drug Administration has authorized for use right now. Shah said the agency has distributed these tests to about 100 public health labs in states. "We've got roughly a million available now," he said, "and expect 1.2 million more in the next two months." But Nuzzo and other researchers are concerned because the CDC and public health labs aren't generally where doctors order tests from. That job tends to be done by major clinical laboratories run by companies and universities, which lack authorization for bird flu testing. As the outbreak grows — with at least 114 herds infected in 12 states as of June 18 — researchers said the CDC and FDA are not moving fast enough to remove barriers that block clinical labs from testing. In one case, the diagnostics company Neelyx Labs was on hold with a query for more than a month. "Clinical labs are part of the nation's public health system," said Alex Greninger, assistant director of the University of Washington Medicine Clinical Virology Laboratory. "Pull us into the game. We're stuck on the bench." The CDC recognized the need for clinical labs in a June 10 memo. It calls on industry to develop tests for the H5 strain of bird flu virus, the one circulating among dairy cattle. "The limited availability and accessibility of diagnostic tests for Influenza A(H5) poses several pain points," the CDC wrote. The points include a shortage of tests if demand spikes. Researchers, including former CDC director Tom Frieden and Anthony Fauci, who led the nation's response to covid, cite testing failures as a key reason the U.S. fared so poorly with covid. Had covid tests been widely available in early 2020, they say, the U.S. could have detected many cases before they turned into outbreaks that prompted business shutdowns and cost lives. In an article published this month, Nuzzo and a group of colleagues noted that the problem wasn't testing capability but a failure to deploy that capability swiftly. The U.S. reported excess mortality eight times as high as other countries with advanced labs and other technological advantages. A covid test vetted by the WHO was available by mid-January 2020. Rather than use it, the United States stuck to its own multistage process, which took several months. Namely, the CDC develops its own test then sends it to local public health labs. Eventually, the FDA authorizes tests from clinical diagnostic labs that serve hospital systems, which must then scale up their operations. That took time, and people died amid outbreaks at nursing homes and prisons, waiting on test results. In contrast, South Korea immediately rolled out testing through private sector laboratories, allowing it to keep schools and businesses open. "They said, 'Gear up, guys; we're going to need a ton of tests,'" said Frieden, now president of the public health organization Resolve to Save Lives. "You need to get commercials in the game." Nuzzo and her colleagues describe a step-by-step strategy for rolling out testing in health emergencies, in response to mistakes made obvious by covid. But in this bird flu outbreak, the U.S. is weeks behind that playbook. Ample testing is critical for two reasons. First, people need to know if they're infected so that they can be quickly treated, Nuzzo said. Over the past two decades, roughly half of about 900 people around the globe known to have gotten the bird flu died from it. Although the three farmworkers diagnosed with the disease this year in the United States had only mild symptoms, like a runny nose and inflamed eyes, others may not be so lucky. The flu treatment Tamiflu works only when given soon after symptoms start. The CDC and local health departments have tried to boost bird flu testing among farmworkers, asking them to be tested if they feel sick. Farmworker advocates list several reasons why their outreach efforts are failing. The outreach might not be in the languages the farmworkers speak, for example, or address such concerns as a loss of employment. If people who live and work around farms simply see a doctor when they or their children fall ill, those cases could be missed if the doctors send samples to their usual clinical laboratories. The CDC has asked doctors to send samples from people with flu symptoms who have exposure to livestock or poultry to public health labs. "If you work on a farm with an outbreak and you're worried about your welfare, you can get tested," Shah said. But sending samples to public health departments requires knowledge, time, and effort. "I really worry about a testing scheme in which busy clinicians need to figure this out," Nuzzo said. The other reason to involve clinical laboratories is so the nation can ramp up testing if the bird flu is suddenly detected among people who didn't catch it from cattle. There's no evidence the virus has started to spread among people, but that could change in coming months as it evolves. The fastest way to get clinical labs involved, Greninger said, is to allow them to use a test the FDA has already authorized: the CDC's bird flu test. On April 16 the CDC opened up that possibility by offering royalty-free licenses for components of its bird flu tests to accredited labs. Several commercial labs asked for licenses. "We want to get prepared before things get crazy," said Shyam Saladi, chief executive officer of the diagnostics company Neelyx Labs, which offered covid and mpox tests during shortages in those outbreaks. His experience over the past two months reveals the types of barriers that prevent labs from moving swiftly. Related StoriesBlowflies linked to bird flu spread in southern JapanStudy reveals how COVID-19 affected the spread and evolution of seasonal influenzaStudy reveals high effectiveness of flu vaccines in children but highlights challenges with certain subtypesIn email exchanges with the CDC, shared with KFF Health News, Saladi specifies the labs' desire for licenses relevant to the CDC's test, as well as a "right to reference" the CDC's data in its application for FDA authorization. That "right to reference" makes it easier for one company to use a test developed by another. It allows the new group to skip certain analyses conducted by the original maker, by telling the FDA to look at data in the original FDA application. This was commonplace with covid tests at the peak of the pandemic. At first, the CDC appeared eager to cooperate. "A right of reference to the data should be available," Jonathan Motley, a patent specialist at the CDC, wrote in an email to Saladi on April 24. Over the next few weeks, the CDC sent him information about transferring its licenses to the company, and about the test, which prompted Neelyx's researchers to buy testing components and try out the CDC's process on their equipment. But Saladi grew increasingly anxious about the ability to reference the CDC's data in the company's FDA application. "Do you have an update with respect to the right of reference?" he asked the CDC on May 13. "If there are any potential sticking points with respect to this, would you mind letting us know please?" He asked several more times in the following weeks, as the number of herds infected with the bird flu ticked upward and more cases among farmworkers were announced. "Given that it is May 24 and the outbreak has only expanded, can CDC provide a date by which it plans to respond?" Saladi wrote. The CDC eventually signed a licensing agreement with Neelyx but informed Saladi that it would not, in fact, provide the reference. Without that, Saladi said, he could not move forward with the CDC's test — at least not without more material from the agency. "It's really frustrating," he said. "We thought they really intended to support the development of these tests in case they are needed." Shah, from the CDC, said test manufacturers should generate their own data to prove that they're using the CDC's test correctly. "We don't have a shortage such that we need to cut corners," he said. "Quality reigns supreme." The CDC has given seven companies, including Neelyx, licenses for its tests — although none have been cleared to use them by the FDA. Only one of those companies asked for the right of reference, Shah said. The labs may be assisted by additional material that the agency is developing now, to allow them to complete the analyses — even without the reference. "This should have happened sooner," Saladi told KFF Health News when he was told about the CDC's pending additional material. "There's been no communication about this." Greninger said the delays and confusion are reminiscent of the early months of covid, when federal agencies prioritized caution over speed. Test accuracy is important, he said, but excessive vetting can cause harm in a fast-moving outbreak like this one. "The CDC should be trying to open this up to labs with national reach and a good reputation," he said. "I fall on the side of allowing labs to get ready — that's a no-brainer." Clinical laboratories have also begun to develop their own tests from scratch. But researchers said they're moving cautiously because of a recent FDA rule that gives the agency more oversight of lab-developed tests, lengthening the pathway to approval. In an email to KFF Health News, FDA press officer Janell Goodwin said the rule's enforcement will occur gradually. However, Susan Van Meter, president of the American Clinical Laboratory Association, a trade group whose members include the nation's largest commercial diagnostic labs, said companies need more clarity: "It's slowing things down because it's adding to the confusion about what is allowable." Creating tests for the bird flu is already a risky bet, because demand is uncertain. It's not clear whether this outbreak in cattle will trigger an epidemic or fizzle out. In addition to issues with the CDC and FDA, clinical laboratories are trying to figure out whether health insurers or the government will pay for bird flu tests. These wrinkles will be smoothed eventually. Until then, the vanishingly slim numbers of people tested, along with the lack of testing in cattle, may draw criticism from other parts of the world. "Think about our judgment of China's transparency at the start of covid," Nuzzo said. "The current situation undermines America's standing in the world."

Here’s how experts say we should be mitigating the risk of H5N1 human outbreaks. By Lauren Leffer Updated on Jun 17, 2024 9:00 AM EDT A highly pathogenic variant of avian influenza has begun spreading in dairy cows. Credit: Matthew Ludak for The Washington Post via Getty Images Share A highly pathogenic subtype of avian influenza (or bird flu), known as H5N1 is spreading among animals worldwide. For the past couple of decades, global health agencies have kept tabs on the virus, which is most well known for decimating poultry flocks and infecting wild birds, while mammalian and human cases have been rare. Yet the current spate of outbreaks, first detected in Europe in Fall 2020, has drawn particular concern and attention. Unlike in prior outbreaks, mammalian infections have become significantly more common, and many mammal species including pet cats, seals, foxes, mice, skunks, bobcats, and even a bottlenose dolphin have been falling ill and testing positive for the flu. Also unlike in past outbreaks, some mammals seem to be spreading the virus among themselves, indicating that H5N1 has mutated to be more easily transmissible beyond birds. May 29, 2023: An employee of the Agricultural and Livestock Service (SAG) removes a dead cormorant (Guanay Cormorant) from Changa Beach in Coquimbo, Chile. Avian influenza is affecting 53 species across Chile, including pelicans, seagulls, and Humboldt penguins, whose population has decreased by 10%. In 2023 alone, the National Fisheries and Aquaculture Service (Sernapesca) has detected 8,140 deaths, almost double the total number of deaths in the last 14 years combined (4,392). The H5N1 virus arrived in Latin America in October 2022 through migratory birds and has spread throughout the continent. A dozen countries have already reported positive cases of the disease.

An outbreak first detected in Texas in March has now impacted at least 12 states, with cases so far reported on 90 dairy farms nationwide– numbers many experts believe to be an underestimate. “Avian influenza is something that most people in epidemiology, infectious disease, and pandemic preparedness have been worried about for a long time,” says Nahid Bhadelia an infectious disease physician and the founding director of Boston University’s Center on Emerging Infectious Disease. “What’s different about the current scenario is that you are seeing possible changes in the way that the virus is now infecting animals, to the point where it’s closer to where human beings are–both geographically and physiologically,” she tells Popular Science. Livestock and humans exist in close proximity, particularly in the case of dairy cows, which have to be regularly milked by dairy workers. With more human-animal contact opportunities, the virus, which has already spilled over from wild birds into dozens of species around the world, could continue to mutate and eventually become readily transmissible between people, Bhadelia says. Sustained human transmission would be a step towards a bird flu pandemic that hasn’t been observed before. “Avian influenza is something that most people in epidemiology, infectious disease, and pandemic preparedness have been worried about for a long time.” Since 1997, 912 human cases of H5N1 have been confirmed globally, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The large majority of these infections were in people with close contact to infected animals. A small portion of cases are believed to be attributable to human-to-human transmission, but sustained human-to-human transmission hasn’t been seen. In the current outbreak, three human cases of H5N1 have been reported in the U.S., all mild infections in dairy workers. To mitigate the risk of many more human cases, experts say we need proactive efforts involving virus surveillance, multiple types of testing and data collection, robust communication and information sharing, new biosecurity strategies, worker safety protections, and improved vaccines. Knowledge is power Ultimately, we can’t control how a virus’ genome changes, and we can’t entirely avoid the possibility of another flu pandemic, says William Schaffner, a physician and infectious disease professor at Vanderbilt University. What we can do is try to reduce risk and control how we prepare for it. Testing, multiple sources say, is a big part of that. “Everyone agrees, I think, that we would love to do much more testing than we’re doing at the present time,” Schaffner says. “There should be more testing,” in more states, of more animals, of more people, and of environmental proxies for viral spread like wastewater, says Bhadelia. “Where I really think we should be focused is testing of farmworkers and testing of animals,” Celine Gounder, an infectious disease specialist and epidemiologist at New York University and the Kaiser Family Foundation, tells Popular Science. “Everyone agrees, I think, that we would love to do much more testing than we’re doing at the present time.” “We don’t have what we need to be making effective decisions. The number one priority I would identify is we need to be doing a lot more surveillance,” says Rachael Piltch-Loeb, an assistant professor of public health and policy at the City University of New York. Though testing alone doesn’t stop viral spread, it provides key information about where and how that spread is happening. “Not knowing is never a good thing,” emphasizes Shaffner. Currently, there are lots of unanswered questions about H5N1 in cows and people. We don’t know how often exposed animals or people become infected, we don’t know everywhere the virus is currently spreading, we don’t know if it is moving through airborne transmission or just contact with contaminated equipment and milk droplets. In past human cases, the fatality rate for H5N1 has been about 50%. But none of the three recently infected U.S. workers have died or even gotten severely ill. Why is “one of the great mysteries,” Bhadelia says, though she adds that that historical fatality rate is likely a big overestimate. Often only the most severe infections are documented early in a virus’ emergence and multiple factors like differences in transmission route, viral mutations, and who is getting sick and where can drastically shift disease outcomes. But still, we need testing to know more. “Not knowing is never a good thing.” Testing doesn’t just show what animals or people are currently positive for the virus, but it can also reveal how spread is unfolding, by what means, and specifics about the virus itself. Understanding the geography of outbreaks can inform when and where isolation strategies like quarantines are applied. With testing and follow-up, close contacts of infected people and animals can be monitored and precautions can be taken to minimize spread. Genetic sequencing performed on virus samples collected through tests can help virologists spot new, potentially dangerous mutations and piece together paths of transmission. Serology testing, which measures antibodies in blood, can show if there are asymptomatic cases proliferating in people and animals. “The notion of surveillance is to identify a problem before it is at the scale that we can’t control,” says Piltch-Loeb. With the problem identified, you can offer clearer guidance. There are many testing efforts already underway. The USDA has begun mandating testing for lactating dairy cows being transported across state lines. The CDC is continuing to track influenza A cases beyond the regular flu season. And multiple state agencies have voluntary testing programs. Yet these efforts haven’t been as successfully implemented everywhere and there are barriers in trust and communication standing in the way. Collaboration is key Pandemic prevention needs to be a collaborative effort between government agencies at every level and the stakeholders most directly affected by the spreading virus, says Bhadelia. In most places, dairy farm owners and workers have been slow to start testing for and reporting cases. Unlike poultry and pig farmers, dairy farmers haven’t previously been swept up in an avian influenza scare. Suddenly, their livelihood is potentially at risk. “They’re all confused and anxious about this,” says Schaffner. Owners don’t want to test cows and then be forced to shut down milk production and lose money.

Both groups need assurances and incentives to get them on board in the public health effort, she says. In May, the USDA announced a compensation program to help dairy farmers bear the costs of testing their livestock, sampling their milk, sanitizing equipment, and the burden of lost milk production. Ideally, Gounder says there would be a similar federal effort to protect workers–potentially granting them legal status– if they come forward for testing as well. Figuring out how to boost trust and dialogue with farms is an ongoing process nationwide, but one place is already ahead of the curve. Michigan has been a standout, say both Piltch-Loeb and Bhadelia. Michigan is doing more testing and reporting than any other state (hence why they’ve detected more cases among both cows and humans than anywhere else–it’s not because there’s actually more virus there, says Bhadelia). “The number one priority I would identify is we need to be doing a lot more surveillance.” Natasha Bagdasarian, the state’s chief medical executive and an infectious disease physician, credits much of that success so far to transparent communication and a dedication to building proactive and inclusive public health infrastructure. They’ve expanded their testing lab capacity to seven-day-a-week operations. They’ve got locally known dairy inspectors reaching out to farmers they’ve already established relationships with. They’ve been coordinating across human health, natural resource, labor, veterinary, and agricultural departments with daily meetings. They’re working with local health providers and migrant worker outreach organizations. “From day one, we’ve taken a very ‘one health’ response to this–it’s the concept that human health, animal health, and environmental health are closely linked.” In Michigan, as with everywhere else, trust in public health entities declined during the Covid-19 pandemic, says Bagdasarian. But the state took that decline seriously and began trying to combat it even before avian influenza materialized in midwest dairy farms, she notes. The state created a public health advisory council that published a report full of recommendations last year. “Maybe some of that work is paying off,” she says. “It doesn’t make sense for us to put out guidance that isn’t practical for people on the ground.” The state has a serology study planned. Michigan dairy workers receive regular health check-ins via text. The state agricultural agency has required farms to implement biosecurity measures like disinfection of people and vehicles moving between farms and logging farm visitors. Health officials there are also talking with dairy workers to better understand the riskiest aspects of their job and what sorts of personal protective equipment might be best to recommend–PPE should ideally grant safety without compromising someones’ ability to work. “It doesn’t make sense for us to put out guidance that isn’t practical for people on the ground,” says Bagdasarian. It’s just one of many ways engaging those on the front lines is important. Improving vaccines Testing, PPE, incentives, and information sharing are all important public health measures. But ultimately, the only thing that can stop a virus in its tracks–especially one that is widely circulating in wild animals– is an effective vaccine, says Michael Osterholm, an epidemiologist and director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. “We need much better vaccines– ones with durability, broad range of prediction, and that are readily available,” he says. Continually studying flu viruses and funding vaccination development is critical, he adds. The Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, part of the federal Department of Health and Human Services, does have a candidate vaccine for H5N1 that’s being stored in bulk. The administration announced plans in May to put that vaccine into vials, producing nearly five million doses over the next few months. This is a good step towards preparedness, says Bhadelia, but it comes with complications. People have to be convinced to take a vaccine. Once portioned into vials, vaccine doses begin the countdown to expiration, says Schaffner. Vaccines can interfere with our ability to track flu spread, because vaccinated people will have antibodies, despite no history of actual infection, notes Bhadelia. People have to be convinced to take a vaccine. How, where, and when to deploy those doses remains unsettled. And it’s unclear how well the candidate vaccine will protect the possible future strains of virus that might mutate to transmit between people, says Osterholm. Conversations about if and how to use vaccines are ongoing in Michigan, says Bagdasarian, and beyond, says Schaffner. Soon, there will be a national case study to look to in Finland. There, the disease hasn’t yet appeared in cows, but there have been outbreaks on poultry, mink, and fox farms. The government will soon offer H5N1 vaccines to select groups of people with potential exposure routes like scientists studying the virus, certain farmers, and veterinarians. That test could help improve future vaccination formulas and strategies. Flexibility and understanding There is no biological law that says H5N1 will definitely become a pandemic disease that easily passes from person to person. A pivotal mutation emerging would be the product of randomness and opportunity–likely beginning with an unlucky animal or person getting infected with two flu types at once, allowing the viruses to “reassociate” and swap genetic material. At multiple points over the past 25 years, Osterholm says flu scientists have warned of an imminent potential avian flu pandemic. In 2012, he notes that biologists said the virus was just one mutation away from that worst-case scenario. So far, that threat hasn’t materialized. But there is also no biological law that says it won’t. Flu pandemics have occurred throughout human history, and as recently as 2009 with swine flu (H1N1). A future flu pandemic–whether it be from this particular global outbreak or another–could always happen, Osterholm says–which is why preparedness and thinking ahead are so important. The CDC maintains that the threat of avian flu to the general public is low for the time being. Dairy workers are currently the people most at risk. But there are still some steps that everyone can take towards public health right now. For starters, people should take extra care in interacting with animals–wild or domestic, says Bhadelia–especially those that seem sick. And everyone should absolutely avoid drinking raw unpasteurized milk, say Bhadelia and Schaffner. There is no biological law that says H5N1 will definitely become a pandemic disease that easily passes from person to person… There is also no biological law that says it won’t. Unpasteurized milk is always a safety risk, but especially so now–when we know that at least one in five milk samples contain H5N1 virus. Cats and mice have gotten sick and died of the avian flu after drinking milk from infected cows. The virus ended up in the cats’ brains and lungs, triggering lesions. And it’s not just a matter of individual safety. When it comes to opportunities for H5N1 to evolve in humans, every person who decides to drink raw milk is opting to potentially trigger a public health crisis. Little is clear and well-established about H5N1 right now, but over 100 years of scientific evidence supports pasteurization of milk for human health and safety. Beyond the immediate, an open mind will be important moving forward. Given the number of unknowns, one of the most critical aspects to a successful pandemic risk mitigation effort is flexibility, says Schaffner. “We’re going to learn a lot of new things, we may have to change our minds. That’s a very hard thing for the public to grasp.” Yet still, people will have to keep up. Communication and education efforts will have to improve. Health agencies at every level will have to share information as they learn it. The public will have to have reason to trust that information, even as it shifts.

Here’s what the numbers mean. Ever been confused by the names for bird flu or Spanish flu H1N1? Type A influenza has 130 known subtypes, but which ones cause the flu in people? Here’s what the numbers mean. There are more than 200 potential types of influenza, but we most commonly listen up when we hear the words "bird flu" (Dado Ruvic/REUTERS ) Avid virus-watchers will know that influenza viruses that make the news often feature the letters "H" and "N" in their names, such as H5N1 or H9N2. Those are examples of "Type A" influenza viruses — classed as highly infectious pathogens and a significant threat to influenza viruses that make the news. But there are B, C and D types as well, with various sub-types and lineages, many colloquially known as avian/bird, cow and swine flues. ALSO READ: WHO confirms human case of bird flu in India You can forgive yourself for feeling confused — because it is confusing: And it's not immediately clear which types of flu risk public health to the extent of the Spanish flu of 1918 or a COVID-style pandemic. So, here's DW's guide to help you navigate the maze of influenza code. We'll start with those four types of the virus. The four types of influenzaAs mentioned above, there are four types of influenza: A, B, C and D. Types A and B cause seasonal, epidemic outbreaks of influenza among humans during winter months. But only type A is known to cause pandemics. Type A influenza viruses often originate in aquatic birds and spread among bird species — that's then known as avian influenza or bird flu. But they can also spread to other mammals if the virus has the right mutations. Some strains of the Type A virus H1N1 are endemic (consistently present) in humans, bird, and pigs. Annual flu vaccines help protect us against strains of H1N1 viruses, among others. The A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses, adapted from H1N1, caused the Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918, which killed between 20-50 million people. The variant has been genetically traced to flu outbreaks in swine populations (swine flu) as recently as 2009. At the time of writing in June 2024, only two subtypes of influenza A — A(H1N1)pdm09, and A(H3N2) — were co-circulating (at the same time) among humans. A major outbreak of H5N1 is also currently ongoing in birds and cattle in the US, but there is no evidence yet it's spreading in humans. Type C influenza viruses can infect humans and other mammals like pigs, but cause mild illnesses in people. Flu due to Type C viruses are rare compared to type A viruses. And Type D influenza viruses primarily affect cattle. They can spread to other animals, but no human infections have been observed. The subtypes of influenza A virusesNow let's unpack the those "HxNy" codes. We'll stick to Type A influenzas because those are the ones that use this specific denomination and pose the greatest threat to human public health. Type A influenza viruses are classified according to two types of proteins found on the surface of the virus: Hemagglutinin (H or HA) Neuraminidase (N or NA) Hemagglutinin and neuraminidase are found in all types of influenza and they work as a viral team: The hemagglutinin helps the virus attach itself to a cell to infect it, and the neuraminidase releases the virus to allow it infect other cells — that, in the simplest of terms, is how the virus spreads in your body. These two proteins determine the "infectivity" and "pathogenicity" of the virus — essentially, how dangerous they are for your health. There are 130 known H + N combinations. But since viruses are good at "reassortment" — a process by which viruses swap genetic information — there is the potential for many more. Reassortment in viruses can happen when, for example, two subtypes of a virus infect the same host (a person or non-human animal) at the same time. Add to that the fact that new H + N subtypes do emerge in the wild. Until recently, for instance, researchers spoke of 16 hemagglutinin subtypes in influenza, but now two further subtypes are known to exist: H17 and H18 found in two species of bats. When the H and N numbers are unknown, H takes the variable "x" and N takes the variable "y". Type B influenza denominationsType B influenza viruses are named according to their lineage. And there are two: Yamagata and Victoria. The names for Type B influenza viruses aren't as varied as those for Type A because the H + N subtypes in Type B influenza viruses don't appear to vary within their lineage. However, they can be further defined into clades and subclades, or groups and sub-groups. B/Victoria influenza viruses, for example, include the V1A clade and sub-clades V1A.1, V1A.2 and V1A.3. B/Yamagata include Y1, Y2 and Y3 clades but no known sub-clades. Types of influenza to watch out for (if you are human)Influenza viruses originating in animals don't aften affect humans, but when it does, we speak of zoonotic transmission. That's the same for any disease where there is a transmission from animal to human-animal or the other way around. Five subtypes of avian influenza A viruses do caused human infections — H5, H6, H7, H9, and H10 viruses. Most of the zoonotic forms of influenza — from birds to humans — are A(H5N1) and A(H7N9). A(H5N6) — known as a Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) — and A(H9N2) — a Low Pathogenic Avian Influenza (LPAI) — have also caused human infections. As mentioned above, Type C influenza viruses tend only to cause mild illnesses and Type D influenza viruses are not known to affect humans at all. Catch every big hit,...

Dr Dewar described the scene awaiting them as unlike anything the remote continent had ever experienced."This is the first time we are seeing something so widespread," she said."To arrive in some places where we have had mass mortality events was quite difficult to work through and be in."Loading...Scientists uncovered four new locations where the virus had spread and documented thousands of dead Adelie penguins on one of Antarctica's neighbouring islands.A severe strain of bird flu has reached AntarcticaPhoto shows Rows of dead birds including skuas and penguins. A highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza has breached the world's most remote continent. Scientists say it's only a matter of time before it reaches Australia. Dr Dewar said the virus had the potential to devastate wildlife and the ecosystem in Antarctica."We have seen devastating consequences in South America with over 600,000 sea birds affected and over 50,000 sea mammals succumbing to the virus," she said."We do predict that it will come into Australia with a lot of migratory birds around spring time."According to Wildlife Health Australia, targeted surveillance efforts for avian influenza continue to focus on sampling from waterfowl and shore birds, particularly from locations where wild birds are known to mix with poultry and humans.General surveillance across Australia is focusing on the exclusion of avian influenza from wild bird mortality and morbidity events.Avian influenza mass wildlife deaths:2020 Germany: 3,000 red knots2021/22 Israel: 8,000 Eurasian cranes2022 Peru: 10,000 wild birds2022 Chile: 4,000 sea lions(Source: Wildlife Health Australia, October 2023)A different strain in chickensThe strain of bird flu killing thousands of penguins and other birds in Antarctica is different from the strains that have decimated the poultry industry in Victoria in the past month.More than 1 million chickens have had to be culled in response to the outbreak of the highly contagious and deadly H7 strains of bird flu at farms at Meredith, Terang, and other locations in western Victoria including a commercial duck farm.A seventh Victorian chicken farm was found to be infected last week.Agriculture Victoria believes the disease had spread from wild birds into domestic poultry.A separate strain of the HPAI H7N8 virus has been detected at an egg farm in the Hawkesbury district of New South Wales.ABC Gippsland — local news in your inboxGet our local newsletter, delivered free each TuesdayYour information is being handled in accordance with the ABC Privacy Collection Statement.Email addressSubscribePosted Sat 22 Jun 2024 at 10:59pmSaturday 22 Jun 2024 at 10:59pmSat 22 Jun 2024 at 10:59pm, updated Sun 23 Jun 2024 at 6:14amSunday 23 Jun 2024 at 6:14amSun 23 Jun 2024 at 6:14amShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Top StoriesFamily shares tribute for Eleanor Bryant, teacher's aide killed when truck crashed into preschoolTopic:Road Accidents and IncidentsPhoto shows Eleanor Bryant, who was killed when a truck crashed into a Victorian preschool, pictured smiling at the races.Early election speculation reaches a fever pitch as Albanese announces two candidates in two hoursTopic:ElectionsPhoto shows A man in a black suit and a yellow tie stands at a podium, addressing the press and gesturing to the crowd.Donald Trump and the one big threat to Australia's almost $4 trillion superannuation systemDAnalysis by David TaylorPhoto shows SuperannuationUnder proposed laws the truth about COVID-19 could have been struck from the internetTopic:Social MediaPhoto shows A row of people looking at their phones with one set of hands and phone in focus.

Recently, the A(A(H5N1)) strain of avian influenza has been finding its way into domestic poultry flocks. The current avian flu, referred to as A(H5N1), has been in the news and all over social, so you may be worried about how to talk with your staff and customers if they bring it up. While scientists at the USDA, FDA, CDC and other organizations are still investigating how the virus spreads from one species to another, the CDC says the threat of human infection from A(H5N1) is low. Just like any other pathogen such as salmonella or E. coli that could make your customers sick, safe food handling practices are the best ways to reduce the risk of any foodborne illness, but it may help to understand the facts so you can readily answer questions. Here’s what you need to know (“What to Know About Bird Flu”): Background Recently, the A(A(H5N1)) strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has been finding its way from wild bird populations to domestic poultry flocks. A(H5N1) is highly pathogenic among birds, but also has the potential to infect other species. First detected in 1996 in domestic waterfowl, particularly geese, in Southern China, A(A(H5N1)) caused outbreaks in poultry in China and Hong Kong resulting in 18 human cases. Outbreaks in 2003 to 2005 spread the A(A(H5N1)) strain from Asia to the Pacific, Africa, the Middle East and Europe A North American strain of A(A(H5N1)) carried by migratory birds is low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI), but the U.S. has been experiencing its first outbreak of the HPAI strain since early 2022. A(A(H5N1)) has been in the news even more since March of this year when the virus was discovered in herds of dairy cattle in Texas and Michigan. Since the USDA and state agricultural departments began testing in April, the virus has shown up in dairy herds in seven other states (CO, ID, NC, NM, OH, SC, SD). Two dairy farm workers, one in Texas, and one in Michigan, have been infected, bringing the number of known cases ever found in the U.S. to three. All three of these U.S. cases involved people who worked closely with infected animals on farms. (For example, the first U.S. case was a poultry farm worker in Colorado who was depopulating an infected flock of chickens.) Facts to share Unlike COVID-19, A(A(H5N1)) infection is not primarily through airborne transmission, but from direct contact with the virus, either from handling an infected bird or animal and touching your nose, mouth or eyes, or ingesting it. Scientists also theorize it’s possible that breathing dust containing the virus (from dried feces or a dead animal) could result in infection (“How Bird Flu is Spreading”). Farm workers should use personal protection equipment (PPE), especially when working with poultry flocks or dairy herds known to be infected. Pasteurized milk is safe to consume, as are products made from pasteurized milk. The heat of pasteurization kills the A(H5N1) virus along with other potential pathogens. Your customers may have heard that fragments of the A(H5N1) virus have been found in pasteurized milk. While true, the CDC states that virus fragments cannot infect humans. In late May, the FDA confirmed that 297 samples of retail dairy products produced at 132 processing locations across 38 states contained no viable HPAI A(H5N1) virus. And now that the USDA is monitoring dairy herds more closely, milk from sick herds is being destroyed before it’s transported to processors. The CDC advises against purchasing or serving raw milk or dairy products. Beef is safe to eat. Your customers may have heard that some dairy cattle end up in the meat supply. The USDA considers the U.S. meat supply safe. And, cooking any raw meat product to the proper internal temperature per the FDA Food Code will kill the A(H5N1) virus along with any other potential pathogens. Eggs are safe to eat when cooked to the proper temperature. In a joint risk assessment with the USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), the FDA determined that the chance of people getting infected with bird flu from shell eggs is low. And when properly stored and prepared, eggs pose an even lower risk. You can download a pdf on how to safely handle eggs. Again, cooking foods to proper internal temperatures kills the virus, according to the CDC. The USDA now has incentives in place to encourage more testing of dairy herds and improve safety on affected premises, paying up to $28,000 for things like PPE for workers, development of biosecurity plans, reimbursement of veterinarian costs, and shipping costs of test samples. (Read this fact sheet for more on new actions to reduce the impact and spread of A(H5N1).) Facing a new disease so soon after the pandemic can potentially make customers nervous. Armed with the right information, avian flu becomes a lot less scary.

Last year we saw influenza cases through the year. Although, the Indian population in general has been resistant to such viruses, due to large population once a person is infected the spread will be quick. This could be the reason why it is being recommended for all,â said Dr Kiran Madhala, convener scientific committee, IMA.There are two types of influenza vaccines. Inactivated Influenza Vaccine (IIV) which includes recombinant trivalent and quadrivalent influenza vaccines and live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV). âAt the time of preparing the guidelines trivalent influenza vaccine is not available in India, if and when available, it should be preferred over tetravalent vaccine,â the document stated, adding that all adults, including pregnant women, should take one dose yearly.As for the pneumococcal vaccine there are four different types each dealing with several strains of the virus. There are over 60 serotypes of pneumonia. These vaccines can prevent pneumonia, meningitis and sepsis. âThis vaccine is recommended for all, especially those with increased risk irrespective of age (for adults) 1 dose of PCV13 followed by PPSV23 1 year later. Adults can receive pneumococcal vaccines (any PCV13 or PPSV23) with herpes zoster vaccines and seasonal influenza vaccines at the same time if required,â it read.We also published the following articles recentlyCan markets learn to love populism and stop worrying?Hindustan Unilever is up 8% post-election verdict, while L&T is down over 8%.

(Associated Press/Charlie Neibergall, File)APBy Ann Marie Barron | ABarron@siadvance.comSTATEN ISLAND, N.Y. — Will bird flu be the next pandemic? According to a report, former Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Dr. Robert Redfield recently said it’s not a question of “if,’' but “when.”In the last two years, millions of wild and domestic birds worldwide have lost their lives to bird flu. But it has hardly affected people.Yet, Redfield told NewsNation’s Brian Entin on Friday he believes “bird flu will enter humans” and that it could have “significant mortality.”The CDC has said it is “extremely rare” for the virus to spread among humans.The virus has also been detected in dozens of cattle across the country, and the World Health Organization last month identified the first human death in Mexico City.“I really do think it’s very likely that we will, at some time, it’s not a question of if, it’s more a question of when we will have a bird flu pandemic,” Redfield, who was CDC director from 2018 to 2021, told NewNation.He also pointed out that bird flu has a “significant mortality” when it enters humans compared to the coronavirus (COVID-19). The mortality is somewhere between 25% and 50%, he told NewsNation.The death rate for COVID was 1.1% during the height of the pandemic, according to Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. How does bird flu spread?Avian influenza, or bird flu, is an infection from a type of influenza virus that usually spreads in birds and other animals, according to the Cleveland Clinic.The virus usually spreads in birds, but can also infect humans if they come in contact with an infected animal’s body fluid, according to Johns Hopkins.People who work with poultry, waterfowl and livestock are most vulnerable to catching the virus.It’s “extremely rare” for the virus to spread from one human to another, according to the Cleveland Clinic, as it can also be spread by inhaling small dust particles in animal habitats.How does bird flu spread between humans?RECOMMENDED•silive.comPoachers exploit demand for eagle feathers, sacred among Native AmericansNov. 7, 2024, 9:00 a.m.Man who killed eagles on a Native American reservation gets nearly 4 years in prisonNov. 7, 2024, 9:00 a.m.Scientists have found that five amino acids must change in the key receptor for bird flu to gain a propensity to bind to a human receptor “and then be able to go human-to-human” as COVID-19 did, Redfield told NewsNation.That’s when we’ll have a pandemic, he said.“And as I said, I think it’s just a matter of time,’' he told NewsNation.If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

Victoria is in the grip of an avian influenza outbreak, with reports that more than 1 million birds will be killed to try and prevent the spread of the highly infectious virus which is spread to poultry by wild birds.The Department of Primary Industries and Regions South Australia (PIRSA) is closely monitoring the situation in Victoria where so far, the outbreak is localised in two areas of the state.Controls are in place to restrict the movement of poultry, poultry products, equipment and vehicles on and off the infected premises and other properties within surrounding Restricted and Control Areas.Bird flu is a virus that can cause a high number of deaths in poultry. It can also present in birds as respiratory distress, head or limb swelling, unusual posture, inability to walk or stand, lethargy and reluctance to eat, drink or produce eggs.A PIRSA representative urged South Australians who own backyard chickens to report any sign of bird flu in their flocks, by immediately contacting their local veterinarian or phoning the Emergency Animal Disease Hotline on 1800 675 888.They also assured that avian influenza was a low risk humans and was not a food safety concern.“Avian influenza virus is a low risk to the public as it rarely affects humans unless there is direct and close contact with sick birds,” the PIRSA spokesperson said.“Eggs and chicken meat are safe to eat provided they are handled and cooked according to standard food handling practices."They said the detection highlighted the importance of biosecurity to protect birds from disease.“Biosecurity is the best defence to protect poultry flocks from disease and poultry producers and owners are reminded to reduce risks by ensuring strict adherence to on-farm biosecurity practices, including restricting contact with wild birds.”For more information, visit Farm Biosecurity.

The disease has affected more than 58 million commercial poultry and backyard flocks, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). More recently, on March 25, the virus officially reached cattle, with unpasteurized milk testing positive for avian influenza in Texas, Kansas, and possibly New Mexico, per the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). The avian flu has also spread worldwide, impacting animals in Europe, Asia, and Africa, Reuters reports. Avian flu has predominantly affects wild birds (especially waterfowl) and poultry (e.g. chickens, turkeys, pheasants, quail, domestic ducks, geese, and guinea fowl), according to the USDA. Direct exposure of farmed birds to wild birds (which are permanently infected) is a likely transmission route of the virus, according to the World Organisation for Animal Health.But as the disease has spread to cattle, so has concern about human transmission. Thus far, there have been three human reports of avian influenza A(H5N1) in the United States, per the CDC. While humans are not typically infected by the virus, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of the World Health Organization (WHO), said "we cannot assume that will remain the case," at a 2023 press conference. More recently, former CDC director, Robert Redfield, warned of a "bird flu pandemic". To stay informed and protected, experts say we should be aware of a few key pieces of information. Here's everything you need to know about bird flu.Experts Featured in This Article:Amesh Adalja, MD, is an infectious disease expert and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center For Health Security. What Is Bird Flu?The CDC defines bird flu as "the disease caused by infection with avian (bird) influenza (flu) Type A viruses." In animals, bird flu is deadly and contagious, and it naturally spreads "among wild aquatic birds worldwide and can infect domestic poultry and other bird and animal species," per the CDC. The virus is transmitted through bird saliva, nasal secretions, and feces. Birds can also become infected if they make contact with a surface that's been contaminated with the virus from another infected bird.Can Humans Get Bird Flu?Yes, but the risk remains low. "The people concerned should be those individuals who work on dairy farms, poultry farms, or drink, unpasteurized milk. The rest of the the general public have a very low risk," says infectious disease expert, Amesh Adalja, MD, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center For Health Security.That said, there have been a few instances in world history in which the virus has spread among humans. "The concern is that some strains of avian influenza will have or develop the capacity to spread efficiently between humans in the manner of the 1918 H1N1 influenza pandemic, which was an avian-origin influenza virus," Dr. Adalja says. An estimated 500 million people, or one-third of the world's population, became infected with the virus and roughly 50 million people worldwide died from it, per the CDC. Bird flu shows potential for another deadly outcome if it continues to spread. "There has been a mortality rate of about 50% in the almost 900 people around the world who have been infected with bird flu between 2003 and 2024," points out Yale Medicine infectious diseases specialist, Scott Roberts, MD, in an interview with the school. That's why Dr. Roberts expressed worry for the years ahead.What Are Bird-Flu Symptoms in Chickens and Other Animals?Infected cattle are reportedly experiencing low lactation and appetite. "We hadn't seen anything like it before," Texas Department of Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller told AP News. "It was kind of like they had a cold." If you're concerned your bird or flock has been impacted by avian flu, here are a few signs and symptoms you should look out for, according to the Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA): Lack of energy, appetite, and coordination Purple discoloration or swelling of various body parts Diarrhea Nasal discharge Coughing Sneezing Reduced egg production and/or soft-shelled or misshapen eggs Sudden death Are There Signs of Bird Flu in Humans?Again, the risk of humans being infected with bird flu remains low for now. But symptoms in humans can run the gamut from red eyes or mild flulike upper-respiratory symptoms to fever, shortness of breath, body aches, and even pneumonia, per the CDC.If you come in contact with infected birds and become sick within 10 days of exposure, the CDC advises that you isolate at home and notify the local or state health department. Lab testing is needed to confirm a diagnosis. Treatment typically includes antiviral medicine, such as oseltamivir (Tamiflu) or zanamivir (Relenza), according to the Mayo Clinic.The best prevention method against bird flu is to avoid exposure altogether. A few preventative guidelines from the CDC include: Avoid direct contact with wild birds, and observe them from a distance. Avoid unprotected contact with domestic birds that look sick or have died. Do not touch surfaces that may be contaminated with saliva, mucous, or feces from wild or domestic birds. If you must handle sick birds because of your job, use safety measures like gloves, eye protection, and frequent handwashing. Should You Stop Eating Poultry, Eggs, or Milk?No. Adequately cooked poultry and eggs are safe to eat though, Dr. Adalja tells PS. Avian influenza is not a food-borne illness, meaning poultry and eggs that are properly prepared and cooked are safe to eat, per the USDA. Proper food-handling recommendations include cooking poultry to an internal temperature of 165°F and washing your hands with warm water and soap before and after handling poultry and eggs. That said, Dr. Adalja does recommend avoiding raw or unpasteurized milk — not just for avian influenza purposes, but for a whole host of infectious threats. — Additional reporting by Chandler PlanteAlexis Jones is the senior health and fitness editor at POPSUGAR.

The outbreaks may come in a continuous and small-scale manner.”Hui said Singapore authorities acquired vaccines designed for the northern hemisphere in the fourth quarter and southern hemisphere shots in the second quarter, as the city state’s flu seasons ran throughout the year.“If Hong Kong’s flu outbreak pattern consistently follows the year-round pattern in Singapore, we cannot rule out the possibility that we may need to learn from Singapore’s model and procure vaccines designed for both hemispheres,” he said.AdvertisementHong Kong currently only uses those for the northern hemisphere.AdvertisementEmergency declared over bird flu HOME MAIL NEWS FINANCE SPORT LIFESTYLE ENTERTAINMENT WEATHER MORE...

Picture: Newswire/ Gaye GerardNSW Agriculture Minister Tara Moriaty confirmed the highly contagious and deadly virus had killed thousands of birds in the past 48 hours, which saw the NSW Government enact its emergency biosecurity incident plan.Ms Moriarty said a funding agreement had also been activated with the Commonwealth, egg industry and other states to compensate producers that were directly impacted.Chicken industry farms surrounding the property where the outbreak occurred have been locked down, and a control order will be issued on Thursday to stop the movement of machinery, materials, animals and transport within 2 km of the affected farm.The lockdown order covers three large commercial poultry farms with up to 355,000 birds that will be monitored for any signs of the virus.Three commercial poultry farms surrounding the farm where avian influenza was detected have been locked down, as authorities try to contain the outbreak. Photo: istock.“There will be no movement of eggs or birds or machinery out of the zone during the control order,” Ms Moriarty said.Earlier today, the NSW chief veterinary Officer, who is leading the incident response, met with key industry organisations to discuss the next steps.Ms Moriaty said they were acting on this bird flu outbreak and would do everything to work through this challenging time for the egg and chicken meat industry.“We have their backs,” she said.Poultry farmers affected by a bird flu outbreak will be compensated for loss of stock. iStock“NSW consumers should not be concerned about eggs and poultry products from the supermarkets, because this detection does not pose a risk to consumer health and the products are safe to consume.“As always people should handle and cook using the standard procedures.”It is rare for avian influenza to be transmitted to humans, and the current strains of bird flu do not transmit easily to people.Most people will not contract the disease, unless they have direct contact with infect birds or animals, or their secretions.People who had direct contact with the infected farm will be contacted by NSW Health for a risk assessment.Symptoms are mostly mild and are similar to the flu including fever, cough, headache, aching muscles, respiratory symptoms and conjunctivitis.Up nextUp nextUp nextUp nextLatest storiesThe Daily BeastConspiracies Run Wild as It’s Reported Kate Never Had CancerConspiracy theories surrounding Kate Middleton’s cancer diagnosis and recovery have erupted online again, after a report by a respected and accredited royal reporter suggested the Princess of Wales never had cancer but was instead found to have “pre-cancerous cells.” Vicious rumors perpetrated by online trolls alleging that Kate either faked or exaggerated her cancer to cover up personal difficulties have been turbocharged by the claim.

Investigations are continuing into the source of the outbreak, with the disease currently believed to have spread from wild birds to domestic poultry.Australia's largest outbreak of bird flu has hit a grim milestone, with Victorian authorities confirming more than 1 million birds will be killed to try and prevent the spread of the virus. Seven farms across south-west Victoria have now been found with highly pathogenic strains of avian influenza, affecting hundreds of thousands of farmed birds. The outbreak began on an egg farm near Meredith in May, and has continued to spread in the region as local farmers face the harsh reality of Australia's biosecurity response to outbreaks of emergency animal diseases.So far there have been no wide-scale shortages of eggs, although Coles has put in place purchase limits. (ABC Rural: Jane McNaughton)Victoria's chief veterinary officer, Graeme Cooke, said the latest infected farm housed between 150,000 and 200,000 egg-laying chickens."This latest infected premises was once again picked up on very early surveillance and that means it can be dealt with very early," Dr Cooke said."I really thank producers within the restricted area where all the cases have been for their help and collaboration as we work our way through this outbreak."Bird flu has been detected at seven farms in Victoria, including in Meredith near Geelong. (ABC Ballarat: Rochelle Kirkham)Nation's largest outbreakThe death toll from the current outbreak of bird flu is more than double the state's most recent outbreak in 2020, which resulted in the death of over 400,000 birds, including emus, turkeys and chickens, across the state.The current outbreak is concentrated mostly to the Golden Plains Shire, one of the largest regions that produces eggs and chicken meat in Victoria, producing about a quarter of Victoria's eggs.A control zone is in place spanning approximately 100 kilometres from west to east across the region, covering six of the seven farms detected with the H7N3 strain of avian influenza."[Control measures] really reduce the level of virus in an area. The faster we can pick it up, the less risk there is of onwards spread," Dr Cooke said.A farm near Terang was found to have a different strain of avian influenza called H7N9. (ABC South West Victoria: Jean Bell)"The requirements in the controlled areas, especially the restricted areas, are to prevent onward movement of the virus either by vehicles, people or other means."Meredith has consistently been detecting [bird flu]."If this virus was allowed to spread onward it would be devastating for the rest of the poultry industry in Victoria and perhaps onward through Australia."The right thing to do is to stop the infected premises being any further risk, and that's the action that is taken through the humane destruction and disposal and the onwards cleansing and disinfection of the farms."An egg farm near Terang was also found to have bird flu within its chicken population last month, however authorities found a different strain, H7N9.Agriculture Victoria is investigating the cause of the outbreaks but so far it is believed the disease has spread from wild birds into domestic poultry.Duck farm infectedThe state's outbreak of avian influenza has also spread to a commercial duck farm near Meredith.Australian Duck Meat Association CEO Greg Parkinson said the farm represented about two per cent of Australia's commercial duck population and mostly supplied meat to restaurants, not supermarkets."It was not unexpected, it's a smallish duck farm — about 40,000 birds — and it was very close to the infected egg farms," he said.About 40,000 farmed ducks have been culled in on a farm near Meredith after bird flu was detected. (ABC Rural: Jane McNaughton)"Ducks are kept in sheds precisely for these sorts of reasons — we try to buffer ourselves from wild bird incursions and virus spillovers."About 30 million ducks are processed for meat per year."Australia's duck meat industry is relatively concentrated and run by two main processors, Luv-a-Duck, which has about 30 farms in western Victoria, and Pepe's Ducks which runs out of New South Wales.The infected duck farm does not supply either of these companies.International infectionsThere are many types of bird flu, including the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain, which has been detected in Asia, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, North America, South America and Antarctica.This strain of the disease has spread beyond poultry, affecting various mammals including penguins, cattle and humans.This strain has not been detected in Australian animals, however the nation recorded its first ever human case in March, when a child returned home from India with the disease.The child has since recovered and authorities have confirmed there is no ongoing threat to the public.Millions of wild birds have died in the avian influenza H5N1 outbreak sweeping the world since 2020. (Reuters: Ronen Zvulun)Australia's response to eradicate avian influenza is in stark contrast to countries like the United States, where more than 96 million birds have been affected by the disease since an outbreak that began in 2022, according to the U.S Centre for Disease Control and Prevention.Anyone who notices abnormal behaviour in their flocks, or unexplained deaths, is urged to contact the 24-hour Emergency Animal Disease Watch Hotline on 1800 675 888.ABC Rural news dailyKey stories of the day for Australian primary producers, delivered each weekday afternoon.ABC Rural Weekday NewsABC Rural Weekly NewsYour information is being handled in accordance with the ABC Privacy Collection Statement.Email addressSubscribePosted Tue 18 Jun 2024 at 6:07amTuesday 18 Jun 2024 at 6:07amTue 18 Jun 2024 at 6:07amShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Top StoriesFamily shares tribute for Eleanor Bryant, teacher's aide killed when truck crashed into preschoolTopic:Road Accidents and IncidentsPhoto shows Eleanor Bryant, who was killed when a truck crashed into a Victorian preschool, pictured smiling at the races.Early election speculation reaches a fever pitch as Albanese announces two candidates in two hoursTopic:ElectionsPhoto shows A man in a black suit and a yellow tie stands at a podium, addressing the press and gesturing to the crowd.Donald Trump and the one big threat to Australia's almost $4 trillion superannuation systemDAnalysis by David TaylorPhoto shows SuperannuationUnder proposed laws the truth about COVID-19 could have been struck from the internetTopic:Social MediaPhoto shows A row of people looking at their phones with one set of hands and phone in focus.

A control order will extend biosecurity controls to a radius of one to two kilometres around the property.3:51There's more than one bird flu: what recent outbreaks mean for Australia – videoThe farm will be “depopulated”, meaning all chickens will be euthanised and disposed of to prevent further spread.She said the government would “work closely with industry to reduce the risk of spread and minimise any impact on egg supply”.Australia takes a zero tolerance approach to all strains of high-pathogenicity avian influenza, meaning all birds on an infected property, from commercial egg farms to back-yard flocks, must be destroyed. Sign up to receive Guardian Australia’s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter More than one million chickens and ducks have already been euthanised as a result of the outbreak in Victoria, which has spread to seven poultry farms.Genomic sequencing of the viruses, conducted at the CSIRO’s Australian Centre for Disease Preparedness in Geelong, found the two strains identified in Victoria, H7N3 and H7N9, can be traced back to a common strain 12 months ago.Dr Joanne Sillince, the acting chief executive of the Australian Chicken Growers Council, said the laboratory had done a “stupendous” job in quickly identifying strains.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Morning MailFree daily newsletterOur Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The H7N9 strain was detected at a property at Terang 130km away, which was linked through contact tracing to the first farm at Meredith. A control order has been issued to mandate that all birds within a 20km and 15km radius, respectively of the affected farms be kept indoors or otherwise away from contact with wild birds.A spokesperson for NSW Farmers said the organisation is working with the Department of Primary Industries to ensure primary producers have the support they need.“Our focus is on biosecurity for all farmers with poultry, including rapid identification and containment, to help safeguard the health and safety of our birds,” they said.They urged anyone with poultry or other birds, including back yard chooks, to report any symptoms, which include fever, respiratory distress and sudden death, to the Emergency Animal Disease hotline on 1800 675 888.

(Pexels: Mojca J)abc.net.auews/flu-whooping-cough-rsv-cases-up-as-covid-cases-unkown/104002964Link copiedShareShare articleIf it feels like everyone around you is getting sick, you're probably right."We're not seeing a particularly extraordinary year in terms of flu or RSV in isolation," says infectious diseases physician and clinical microbiologist Paul Griffin."What we're experiencing, which is perhaps a little different, is we've got so many things circulating in relatively high levels simultaneously."It's a very significant thing for us to have to deal with and is creating a burden on our healthcare system."Here's a snapshot of some of the most common illnesses making the rounds in our communities, and how you can stay safe this winter.RSV cases have already overtaken the 2022 yearly totalAccording to the health department's National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System (NNDSS), Australia has already recorded over 100,000 cases of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).That is already higher than the 2022 yearly total of 95,949 – and we're only halfway through the year.Dr Griffin says there is a chance 2024 will surpass last year's total as well."We're still seeing a lot of RSV around," he told ABC News."The great difference this year of course is we have vaccines and antibodies to protect some of the most vulnerable."But it's probably too early to see a significant difference as a result of those interventions."So I do think there's a chance those numbers could climb."COVID-19 figures are 'meaningless' nowWhile it might look like COVID-19 cases are down significantly, this is because it is no longer a requirement to report positive RAT results."COVID case numbers are almost meaningless now because we know so few people are getting tested," Dr Griffin said."We know rapid antigen tests are probably still happening but we don't record those results."It may well be that our actual case numbers are many folds higher than what's being reported, five or 10 times more, perhaps."Dr Griffin says the level of hospitalisations is one way of tracking the severity of COVID-19 in the community.The Department of Health reports a seven-day rolling average of COVID-19 hospitalisations.Eighty-one cases were admitted to hospital on June 12, however, the data is delayed by up to two weeks.Influenza cases are on par with the previous two yearsAccording to the NNDSS, Australia has recorded more than 100,000 laboratory confirmed cases of influenza this year.The flu saw record low levels in 2021 when pandemic restrictions – such as social distancing and wearing masks – were in place."It's really hard to know why we see the rates of all these infections that we do," Dr Griffin told ABC News."We know there's year to year fluctuations and some of these things will fluctuate year to year as well as every five years."We've also interrupted any patterns we used to have by what we did for COVID."We saw extraordinarily low levels of all these respiratory infections for a year and a half, two years, because of our interventions to reduce the spread of COVID."How that's altered our subsequent patterns is really hard to know."Whooping cough is returning to pre-pandemic levelsAlong with the flu, cases of whooping cough also declined significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic.But by already recording more than 10,000 whooping cough cases, this year's figures are nearly five times greater than the 2023 yearly total."I think everyone's fatigue and frustration at being mindful of reducing the transmission of all these things has led to all those good things we did during COVID happening at perhaps the lowest levels we've seen in a long time," Dr Griffin says."That's not big lockdowns and border restrictions – that's as simple as hand hygiene and staying home when you're unwell."The rates of all those things has declined and that will certainly be part of the explanation."How to avoid getting sick (or infecting others) this winterDr Griffin recommends "staying home if you're unwell, and particularly staying away from vulnerable people."Hand hygiene and cough and sneeze etiquette are also "really important and effective," as is air quality and ventilation."Mask wearing does make a difference as well," Dr Griffin says."And, not suggesting we have widespread mandates, but we know if worn correctly they help, and of course vaccination."At the moment our flu vaccine rates are some of the worst we've seen in a long time."We've seen whooping cough come back, partly due to low vaccination rates, so we need to remind people of the importance of those."Dr Griffin adds that vulnerable people need to make sure they are boosted against COVID-19."I think there's not enough messaging about the importance of vaccination."Posted Thu 20 Jun 2024 at 8:49pmThursday 20 Jun 2024 at 8:49pmThu 20 Jun 2024 at 8:49pmShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Top StoriesFamily shares tribute

(ABC News: Kate Forrester)It follows — but is not connected to — an outbreak of two strains in Victoria, and a third causing concern around the world.A low-pathogenic case of bird flu was also detected in Western Australia last month.Professor of microbiology at Swinburne University and food health and safety expert Enzo Palombo said that while there's "never been any evidence" of the virus transmitting to food supply, there are still measures that can be taken to minimise risk. Here are the implications of bird flu, and how it will likely affect consumers. What is the H7N8 strain of bird flu?Avian influenza, more commonly known as bird flu, is an infectious virus similar to seasonal influenza (flu) in humans.NSW Health says it spreads predominantly through wild water birds, and there are several types that vary in how deadly it is for the animals.The virus can occasionally, but rarely, spread to humans through contact with infected birds.There has been a lock down of machinery, materials, animals and transport within a radius of 2 kilometres of the affected egg farm, covering three large commercial poultry farms and up to 355,000 birds will be monitored for any signs of the virus.A NSW avian flu lockdown zone was announced on Thursday. (Supplied: Department of Primary Industries)Most strains have not shown evidence of efficient person-to-person transmission or community spread to date, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).HPAI stands for high pathogenicity avian influenza — meaning it is more likely to kill chickens, and has been implicated in eight successfully eradicated poultry outbreaks in Australia.Professor Enzo Palombo said the risk of transmission through the eggs and poultry meat was "remote". (Supplied: Swinburne University)In NSW, it has been eradicated three times, most recently in regional town Young in the Hilltops Region in 2013.H7N8 is different from fellow HPAI and global strain of concern H5N1, detected in a Melbourne toddler recently, as well as H7N3 and H7N9 which have caused outbreaks in Victoria.The strain that led to the quarantine of the Greater Sydney Basin farm is understood to be a "separate spill-over event" potentially from wild birds."In terms of the types of virus that are causing the outbreaks in Australia, they are rarely, if ever, implicated in human disease," Professor Palombo said."If you haven't already, get your annual flu vaccination, because the less human flu there is in the community, the less likely these events where human and bird viruses merge to be something different, can occur."Does it relate to the current egg shortage?Professor Palombo said more broadly, empty shelves in supermarkets can happen when supply farms are impacted, or to prepare consumers for wider anticipated egg shortages."[This can] help the public get used to perhaps having to find alternative supplies," he said.The Victorian outbreak has already affected poultry supply, and led to warnings of potential shortages that could affect egg supplies nationwide.According to the egg industry, there are more than 21 million hens in the national egg flock and more than 1 million in Victoria that will be culled to stop the bird flu spread.Supermarkets have seen reduced quantities of egg supply. (Supplied)In the Hawkesbury farm instance, Australian Eggs managing director Rowan McMonnies said birds on the farm would be euthanised. He said it would cause a "significant blow" to the farm involved and the industry at large.Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland produce more than 350 million dozen eggs each year combined.Ms Moriarty said NSW consumers should not be concerned about eggs and poultry products from the supermarkets "because this detection does not pose a risk to consumer health and the products are safe to consume".President of the NSW branch of the Farmers Federation Xavier Martin said earlier this month that less than 2 per cent of Australia's hens had been impacted.More than 350 million dozen eggs are produced in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland annually. (ABC News: Anthony Pancia )He said that buying restrictions had more to do with supermarket procurement policy than farmers."There's no need for any concerns, avian influenza is not new — it's been in New South Wales about a decade ago."Peak body Australian Eggs assured consumers that there were "still hundreds of egg farms around the country" to support demand as impacted farms recover."These avian influenza incidents will cause some disruption to egg supply as retailers reorganise their supply," Mr McMonnies said. "But purchase limits or patchy supermarket shelves do not indicate a nation-wide shortage."Should we be concerned about diets, coops?Professor Palombo assured the risk of transmission through eggs and poultry meat is "so remote that it's probably not even a concern".Regular precautions in food hygiene, handling, cooking and storing help make the risk negligible, he said.What do we know about Australia's bird flu case?Photo shows A person in a white protective suit stands next to a lake holding a dead crane. Two different strains of avian influenza — also known as "bird flu" — have been detected in Victoria. Here's what to know about bird flu, its risk of transmission to humans and what precautions to take against its spread."If the virus ever gets into the food supply, cooking the food thoroughly, as we should always do with any poultry products, will kill the virus and therefore eliminate the risk."Remember, the flu is a respiratory virus, it doesn't spread through food, which is one reassuring piece of good news."People most at risk are those in close contact with live infected birds, like at farms or abattoirs, Professor Palombo said."In terms of the general public, there's been no evidence of this virus being able to spread to humans unless they are in very deep contact or close contact with infected [birds]."The professor said people with backyard chickens could also be more vigilant watching the health of themselves and their birds."If they see any signs of distress, symptoms like diarrhoea or respiratory symptoms, contact your authorities and report those," he urged.Posted Thu 20 Jun 2024 at 7:20pmThursday 20 Jun 2024 at 7:20pmThu 20 Jun 2024 at 7:20pm, updated Thu 20 Jun 2024 at 11:41pmThursday 20 Jun 2024 at 11:41pmThu 20 Jun 2024 at 11:41pmShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Top StoriesFamily shares tribute for Eleanor Bryant, teacher's aide killed when truck crashed into preschoolTopic:Road Accidents and IncidentsPhoto shows Eleanor Bryant, who was killed when a truck crashed into a Victorian preschool, pictured smiling at the races.Early election speculation reaches a fever pitch as Albanese announces two candidates in two hoursTopic:ElectionsPhoto shows A man in a black suit and a yellow tie stands at a podium, addressing the press and gesturing to the crowd.Donald Trump and the one big threat to Australia's almost $4 trillion superannuation systemDAnalysis by David TaylorPhoto shows SuperannuationUnder proposed laws the truth about COVID-19 could have been struck from the internetTopic:Social MediaPhoto shows A row of people looking at their phones with one set of hands and phone in focus.

Written by Health Desk June 17, 2024 12:04 IST Follow Us Bird Flu in India: According to WHO, The patient had exposure to poultry at home and in the surroundings. (Image Credits: Pexels) Bird Flu Outbreak in India: India has recently reported the second human case of avian influenza A(H9N2). The first case of H9N2 was reported in India in 2019. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the case of human infection with avian influenza A(H9N2) virus was detected in a child of West Bengal. The child has now recovered and was discharged from hospital. According to the IHR (2005), a human infection caused by a novel influenza A virus subtype is an event that has the potential for high public health impact and must be notified to the WHO. The global health agency maintains that most human cases of infection with avian influenza A(H9N2) viruses are exposed to the virus through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments.Also Read Arjun Kapoor opens up about his Hashimoto’s Disease diagnosis—Everything you need to know about this autoimmune disease Spike in typhoid cases linked to prolonged monsoon, report reveals One-third Indians with obesity fail to recognise their condition, widespread misconception leading to delayed treatment 5 Benefits of Angioplasty over open heart surgery that you must know The 4-year-old patient previously diagnosed with hyperreactive airway disease, initially presented to the paediatrician with fever and abdominal pain on 26 January 2024. Also ReadFirst human case of bird flu confirmed in India, four-year-old in West Bengal tests positive “On 29 January, the patient developed seizures and was brought to the same paediatrician. On 1 February, the patient was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (ICU) of a local hospital due to the persistence of severe respiratory distress, recurrent high-grade fever and abdominal cramps. The patient was diagnosed with post-infectious bronchiolitis caused by viral pneumonia. On 2 February, the patient tested positive for influenza B and adenovirus at the Virus Research and Diagnostic Laboratory at the local government hospital. The patient was discharged from the hospital on 28 February 2024,” the WHO said in a statement. On 3 March, with a recurrence of severe respiratory distress, he was referred to another government hospital and was admitted to the pediatric ICU and intubated. On 5 March, a nasopharyngeal swab was sent to the Kolkata Virus Research and Diagnostic Laboratory and tested positive for influenza A (not sub-typed) and rhinovirus. “The same sample was sent to the National Influenza Centre at the National Institute of Virology in Pune for subtyping. On 26 April, the sample was sub-typed as influenza A(H9N2) through a real-time polymerase chain reaction. On 1 May, the patient was discharged from the hospital with oxygen support,” it stated. According to WHO, The patient had exposure to poultry at home and in the surroundings. Meanwhile, there were no known persons reporting symptoms of respiratory illness in the family, the neighbourhood, or among healthcare workers at health facilities attended by the case at the time of reporting. Bird Flu in India: Should you be concerned? The global health agency also cautioned that further sporadic human cases could occur as this virus is one of the most prevalent avian influenza viruses circulating in poultry in different regions. According to Dr Tushar Tayal, Lead Consultant, Department of Internal Medicine, CK Birla Hospital, Gurugram, the viruses may cause such sporadic infections in the future also but since the infection tends to be mild hence there isn’t much for a cause of worry. “The most common strains that actually affect humans are H5N1 and H7N9 and the transmission occurs through Direct contact with infected birds (domestic poultry, such as chickens or ducks),” Dr. Tayal told Financial Express.com. Bird Flu in India: What are the symptoms? Infections in humans have primarily been acquired through direct contact with infected animals or through indirect contact with contaminated environments. On the basis of the original host, influenza A viruses can be classified as avian influenza, swine influenza, or other types of animal influenza viruses. Avian influenza virus infections in humans may cause diseases ranging from mild upper respiratory tract infection to more severe diseases and can be fatal. Conjunctivitis, gastrointestinal symptoms, encephalitis and encephalopathy have also been reported, WHO stated.

According to WHO, following steps should be taken to protect yourself: The public should strictly avoid contact with sick or dead animals, including wild birds, and should report dead animals or request their removal by contacting local wildlife or veterinary authorities. Everyone should perform hand hygiene, preferably washing their hands either with soap and running water (especially if there is visible soiling of hands) or using alcohol hand rubs. Everyone should practice good food safety habits: separating raw meat from cooked or ready-to-eat foods, keeping clean and washing hands, cooking food thoroughly, and handling and storing meat properly. Do not touch or consume raw milk or raw milk products, especially from animals with confirmed or suspected avian influenza A virus infection. Avoid going to areas with suspected/confirmed cases of bird flu. “Preventive measures such as vaccine and proper hygiene , early detection, and treatment of infected cases and surveillance are critical in managing the risk of bird flu in humans,” Dr. Tayal told Financial Express.com.

Photo: Wikimedia CommonsNitish Boodhoo, Shayan SharifPublished on: 21 Jun 2024, 11:19 amCopiedThe spread of the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1 among animals is unprecedented having been found on all continents — except Oceania — with the United Nations calling it “a global zoonotic animal pandemic.”H5N1 is known to be able to infect over 350 species of birds and close to 60 species of mammals with migratory waterfowl — including ducks, swans, geese and gulls — being especially susceptible to various avian-borne influenza viruses. H5N1 infected waterfowl are normally asymptomatic carriers, however, these birds can infect other species (including mammals) along their migratory routes. This global transference allows disease to spread, and for virus genetics and virulence to continually adapt.Alarmingly, evidence indicates that climate change seems to be impacting the emergence of zoonotic viruses like H5N1. As global climate conditions change, avian migratory patterns and routes are also changing. Higher temperatures and extreme weather has resulted in large-scale population shifts in a range of temperate species. These changes have led to diseases emerging in areas — and in genetic configurations — entirely unique and unprecedented.H5N1 is a clear indication that disease monitoring and response efforts are an essential part of any climate change adaptation and mitigation strategy.H5N1The ecology and genetics of H5N1 viruses have evolved significantly since first being detected in China in 1997.The H5N1 virus has been detected in the polar regions and the first confirmed case of a polar bear dying from H5N1 was recorded in Alaska in 2022. Antarctica has seen significant rates of mortality in its native elephant and fur seal populations as a result of viral exposure.Non-migratory wild birds are highly susceptible to H5N1 infections brought on the wings of their more transitory cousins. There have been approximately 75,000 bird casualties globally as per the World Animal Health Information System. However, efforts to accurately estimate the total number of wild birds which have died as a result of H5N1 are hampered by issues in data quality and availability.Meanwhile, a 2022 report on the state of wild birds in the United States estimated that over three billion birds have been lost in part due to climate related factors.On land, the H5N1 virus has been detected in dairy cattle, and in 2024, a Texas agricultural worker was infected with H5N1. These cases suggest that H5N1 is adapting to infect mammalian hosts.In March of this year, reports began to emerge of unusual deaths in young goats on a farm in Minnesota. That same farm had individuals in its poultry flock test positive for H5N1 and the goats and poultry shared similar spaces and water sources. It was later determined that the H5N1 strains in both the poultry and goats were highly related.In May of 2024, the U.S. Department of Agriculture confirmed the detection of H5N1 in alpacas on a farm in Idaho. Similar to previous cases, this farm also had a backyard poultry population test positive for H5N1 with unusually high amounts of the virus detected across the farm. To date, 12 states in the U.S. have reported outbreaks of H5N1 with 101 dairy herds affected.The discoveries of H5N1 on farms, alongside recent analysis of viral dispersal patterns, reiterate the importance of climate change shifting the migratory patterns of birds in the spread of viruses around the globe.Climate change and H5N1There is increasing evidence that climate change is accelerating the global spread and emergence of new H5N1 variants with evidence that wider seasonal variation is enabling the emergence of novel H5N1 variants.In North America, the warmer winters and earlier onset of spring which global warming is causing could allow some moisture-reliant pathogens to survive and spread more easily. Meanwhile, cooler and wetter conditions can enhance the survival of influenza viruses in bird droppings and contaminated water.Simply put, the spread of influenza viruses around the globe is dictated by their ability to survive long enough in a place to be able to transmit elsewhere — and climate change is, in some cases, making this survival more likely.The recent cases of poultry-to-human and cattle-to-human transmissions underscore the threats posed by these viruses and the importance of understanding how climate change is affecting their spread.Implications and mitigationThe H5N1 virus poses a significant threat to public health and the recent cases in the U.S. — coupled with H5N1’s high mortality rates in humans — underscores the need for vigilant monitoring.Dealing with viruses is always a challenge, however, climate change is upending many conventional understandings as shifting waterfowl migration patterns and environmental conditions force us to change strategies. Strengthening health-care infrastructure, and educating communities about H5N1 risks are essential components of a comprehensive response strategy.Promoting sustainable agricultural practices, such as improving biosecurity in poultry and cattle farms, reducing livestock population density and enhancing barn ventilation systems, is crucial. Innovative smart farming technology can also help track viral infections in poultry barns.Conservation efforts are essential to maintain healthy ecosystems and minimize viral spread. Restoring natural habitats can mitigate the effects of climate change on wild bird populations, thereby reducing the risk of H5N1 spillover.In the future, global leaders will need to be vigilant with respect to the trajectory of H5N1. International collaboration on disease management will be crucial for implementing climate adaptation strategies to safeguard the health of both our planet and its inhabitants against viruses like H5N1.Nitish Boodhoo, Research Associate, Department of Pathobiology, University of Guelph and Shayan Sharif, Professor of Immunology and Associate Dean, Research and Graduate Studies, University of GuelphThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

New protocols for detection in humans linked to Avian influenza outbreaks are in place, according to experts at a two-day avian influenza outbreak and response simulation exercise that concluded here on Thursday.Union government's department of animal husbandry and dairying, animal husbandry commissioner, Dr Abhijit Mitra, expressed concern over the expanding scope and geographical spread of avian influenza.Dr Mitra emphasized that while the incidence of avian influenza is not escalating, the disease is no longer restricted to poultry and has been detected in various animal species, including sea mammals and birds other than poultry. The geographical dissemination of the disease is also widening, with cases being reported in an increasing number of regions worldwide. The workshop was in collaboration with World Bank.Throughout the past hundred years, all pandemics that have occurred have originated from animals, and Covid-19 was no exception, he said. âSo, the question is not when the pandemic will come; it will come in some form or another. The question is from which animal and whether we are prepared for it or not,â he added.âThe focus should not be on predicting the exact timing of the next pandemic but rather on identifying the animal source and ensuring that we are adequately prepared to handle it when it inevitably arrives. By understanding the potential origins and implementing effective preparedness measures, we can mitigate the impact of future pandemics on global health and society,â he said.Dr Mitra elucidated that in response to the recent outbreak in Kerala, the department conducted sampling among cattle, buffalo, sheep, goat and other animals. He underscored the importance of close collaboration with public health and wildlife departments, as the disease has the potential to spread to wildlife populations.Regarding human linked cases, Dr Mitra explained protocols are already in place for patients who are admitted for severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) or influenza-like illness (ILI) throughout India. In light of the recent detection of a human case in the USA involving a dairy farmer with conjunctivitis, collection of samples from the conjunctiva in addition to the standard nasopharyngeal samples has been added.Dr Mitra clarified that food safety falls outside the purview of the Department of Animal Husbandry, with FSSAI guidelines and rules taking effect once an egg is laid or milk is produced. He emphasized the importance of proper cooking methods, boiling, washing, and treating food to ensure its safety for consumption. He also stressed the need for proper sterilization of utensils when handling meat.Animal Husbandry Commissioner highlighted that avian influenza exemplifies the concept of "one health," as it has the potential to transmit to humans.Dr Mitra underscored the department's preparedness, with ongoing surveillance for every disease to detect and contain outbreaks before they spread. He set a higher benchmark for disease control and emphasized the sustainability and resilience of India's livestock system, which forms an integral part of the country's life and livelihood.Simulation exercises were attended by 40 participants from diverse sectors such as Human Health represented by the National Centre for Disease Control and Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare among others.End of ArticleFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA Visual Stories Previous9 most unique and rare birds in the worldLifestyle10 foods that contain highest protein per 100 gramsLifestyle8 Indian cities where non-vegetarian food is bannedFoodHow to make South-Indian style Chicken PakoraFood10 lines from Shakespeare's sonnets that are profound life lessonsLifestyleMost beautiful hill stations in the Western Ghats for a serene vacationtravel8 yoga poses that can reduce waist size effectivelyLifestyle7 home remedies to remove yellow stains from teethLifestyle10 books that will help transform your life in the next 3 monthsLifestyleGanesh Chaturthi 2024: 10 South Indian dishes to make for Lord GaneshaFood Next123Hot PicksHurricane FrancineAlberto FujimoriHaitian ImmigrantsStock Market TodayShimla Mosque ViolenceAyushman Bharat Insurance SchemeMP Gang RapeTOP TRENDINGSitaram YechuryIphone 16 vs Iphone 15Travis HeadLargest Mammals in the WorldFrog Leg in SamosaHamster Kombat Daily Cipher CodesShimla Mosque RowGarena Free Fire Max CodesKing CharlesDiljit Dosanjh Concert Tickets OnlineTrending StoriesIn CityEntire WebsiteAmid Shannon Sharpe Viral Video, Former ESPN Host Michelle Beadle Reacts Claiming It Was Not Her2 Army officers thrashed, their female friend gang-raped in Madhya PradeshAyushman Bharat insurance scheme expanded to cover elderly above 70'Will be demolished if...

Here's what experts sayExperts have hosed down fears about bird flu outbreaks in Australia and overseas being stoked on social media.Six Victorian poultry farms have detected cases of avian influenza. Source: AAP / Robert F. Bukaty/APSocial media users are over-egging claims about the impacts of bird flu outbreaks in Australia and overseas, experts say.Six Victorian poultry farms have detected cases of avian influenza, sparking fears of egg shortages and mass bird cullings.The spread of the virus globally has fuelled online conspiracy theories and misinformation about the risks to food supplies and COVID-style lockdowns.Australian Associated Press FactCheck found dozens of outlandish claims on Facebook, TikTok and X about bird flu being deliberately injected into animals to destroy food supplies.Other social media users predict the World Health Organization (WHO) will use the outbreak as a pretext to declare martial law or cancel national elections.Rationing has happened in some locations but experts say there is no egg shortage. Source: AAP / Dean LewinsScientists and industry experts have rubbished those claims, saying the risk to human health in Australia remains low and egg shortages are unlikely.They explain that the more dangerous strain of bird flu (H5N1) spreading in North America and Europe is not the same as the two (H7N3 and H7N9) detected in Victoria.Australian Chicken Growers Council chief executive Joanne Sillince says the response to the local outbreak has been "textbook", with governments and industry working "in perfect harmony".Sillince hosed down claims about potential food shortages. "There is no egg shortage in Victoria," she said."Poultry meat and eggs are perfectly safe to eat."LISTEN TOShould we be worried about bird flu?SBS News07/06/202407:19PlayProfessor Marcel Klaassen, a disease ecologist from Deakin University, says the threat to humans is low because of their genetic differences with birds."Our common ancestor between birds and mammals goes back a long, long time, so it's not easy for a virus that is specialised for birds to affect humans, or to affect mammals," he said.Klaassen says the H5N1 strain is "very nasty" but Australia is well-positioned to handle any outbreak due to geographic isolation and low migratory bird traffic.He says wild birds do bring in new strains from overseas but much more incrementally than in the Northern Hemisphere."They trickle in, compared to the considerable amount of traffic you have between other continents."So it's just trickling into Australia. But it's not said that we are entirely protected from the nasty virus that is now circulating around the globe."Bird flu detected in Victoria is not the same as the strain spreading in North America and Europe. Source: AAP / Yevgeny Yepanchintsev/TASS/Sipa USAThe spread of H5N1 overseas has caused more concern because it has been detected in mammals including seals, sea lions and cattle.The federal agriculture department website says nine outbreaks have occurred in Australia since 1976, all of which were eradicated.Federal Agriculture Minister Murray Watt emphasised earlier this week that the local outbreak isn't H5N1."That's the way we intend to keep it," he said.READ MOREColes has introduced national egg buying limits.

File Photo: PTI Topic | Thiruvananthapuram Thiruvananthapuram: People exposed to H5NI virus-infected birds should remain in home quarantine for 10 days from the last day of exposure, according to the new guidelines and Standard Operating Procedure (SoP) issued by the Kerala Health Department in the wake of repeated bird flu outbreaks in the state. The Kerala government has issued new guidelines as most human infections reported globally occurred after unprotected exposure to sick or dead, infected poultry. Home quarantine has been recommended even to exposed people even if they were wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) while handling the birds. Post-exposure, people should monitor themselves for new respiratory illness symptoms, including conjunctivitis, beginning after their first exposure and for 10 days after their last exposure. Symptomatic persons should isolate from others including household members until it is determined that they do not have H5N1 virus infection. The health department has recommended treating post-exposure influenza with antiviral Oseltamivir to prevent infection, especially in those who had unprotected exposure to virus-infected birds. Health Minister Veena George. File Photo: Manorama Those who develop symptoms shall seek medical evaluation, testing and antiviral treatment. Poultry farmers and workers, veterinarians have been directed to avoid unprotected direct physical contact with sick birds in a 10 km radius around the epicentre, carcasses of birds within a 10 km radius, faeces, raw milk, surfaces and water that might be contaminated with bird/ animal secretions. The document notes that sporadic human infections with highly pathogenic Avian Influenza A(H5N1) virus, with a wide spectrum of clinical severity and a cumulative case fatality of more than 50 per cent, have been reported in 23 countries over more than 20 years. Three cases of H5N1 virus infection in dairy farm workers were recently reported from the USA. Spillover of H5N1 to mammals has not been reported in Kerala. Representational Image: Reuters Influenza A viruses infect the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts of birds causing birds to shed the virus in their saliva, mucous, and faeces. The viruses can also infect the respiratory tract of mammals and cause systemic infection in other organ tissues. Human infections with avian influenza A viruses can happen when enough virus gets into a person’s eyes, nose, or mouth or is inhaled. People with close or prolonged unprotected contact with infected birds or animals or their contaminated environments are at greater risk of infection. Recent preliminary findings from pathogenicity and transmissibility studies indicate that the reassortant influenza A(H5N1) strains cause more severe illness in ferrets, increasing concerns about the potential for transmission to humans, according to the document. Individuals can be exposed to the virus through contact with infected birds, dead birds, or birds' secretions (mucus, saliva), blood and faeces (as birds shed the virus in their secretions and faeces). Transmission of the virus occurs via inhalation or contact with mucus membranes (e.g., eyes, nose, mouth).

(AP file) Michigan Bird flu outbreak is slowing, but MDARD isn’t declaring victory yet by: Matt Jaworowski Posted: Jun 20, 2024 / 10:36 AM EDT Updated: Jun 20, 2024 / 12:31 PM EDT (AP file) by: Matt Jaworowski Posted: Jun 20, 2024 / 10:36 AM EDT Updated: Jun 20, 2024 / 12:31 PM EDT SHARE GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (WOOD) — Knock on wood, but it has been 13 days since the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development has confirmed a new bird flu outbreak in the state. Data compiled by MDARD and the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services shows just one new outbreak in June: a dairy herd in Clinton County reported on June 7. Since the virus rekindled among dairy herds in Michigan in late March, the state previously hadn’t gone more than eight days without confirming a new outbreak. Is this a sign that the emergency order put in place last month is working? MDARD Director Tim Boring isn’t raising his arms in victory quite yet. “It’s certainly positive news that we have not had a new confirmed (outbreak within a) dairy herd since June 7,” Boring told News 8. “We’re too early in our response to really understand the practical possibilities of containment, mitigation and eradication.” Bird flu detected in pets but odds are low, doctor says The bird flu epidemic started in earnest in 2022 and has impacted farms across the country. In the last two years, more than 96 million poultry have been culled because of infections. It returned to Michigan in earnest in March, with the first infection registered among a dairy herd in Montcalm County. Since then, another 24 dairy herds have confirmed outbreaks, and another eight poultry flocks. Highly pathogenic avian influenza is quite deadly in birds, but the survival rate is high among cattle. Though it is rare, humans can also catch the virus. Sign up for breaking news alert emails Since the 2022 outbreak started, four human cases have been reported in the U.S. Three have come since the start of April, including two in Michigan. Most human cases are fairly mild and those cases have not spread to other people. However, a person from Mexico died earlier this month from a bird flu infection — a different strain than the most common one circulating in the U.S. MDARD issued the “HPAI Risk Reduction Response Order” on May 1, outlining specific measures that poultry and dairy farmers should take to try to prevent spreading the virus. It includes strict protocols for disinfecting vehicles and equipment and shutting down animal showcases until the spread is under control. “We know that transmission of this virus is possible not just from cow to cow, but through people, vehicle and equipment movement, as well. The decreasing number of positive detections can be attributed in large part to the combined and coordinated federal interstate movement restrictions and state level biosecurity requirements,” Boring said. Tick that triggers red meat allergy found in Ottawa County The fight is by no means over, but Boring is hopeful that the latest data shows the virus spread in Michigan is back in check. Still, the agency isn’t letting its guard down. “At MDARD, we’re going to continue to stress the importance of testing cattle on farms, not only to protect animal health, but also human health,” Boring said.

This includes steering clear of free-roaming chickens often spotted around neighbourhoods in Singapore. Also called bird flu, the avian influenza has in recent weeks infected humans in Australia and the United States. While there are no known cases of the virus in Singapore so far, authorities said that bird flu is endemic in the region and stressed a need to stay vigilant and safeguard against infections. STRICT PRECAUTIONARY MEASURES Singapore has multiple rings of defence against highly pathogenic strains of avian influenza, which can cause severe disease or death for birds, as well as flu-like symptoms in humans. In a joint statement, the Animal and Veterinary Service (AVS) – an arm of the National Parks Board (NParks) – and the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) said they work closely to put in place precautionary measures. For example, they engage overseas authorities on the matter of bird flu, and conduct regular inspections of imported birds at farms and shops. AVS also tests migratory birds for avian influenza. Imported fowl and poultry products can only come from approved sources, which will be banned if any H5N1 case is found. This means that poultry supply – including eggs – can fluctuate from time to time. SFA said the food industry is encouraged to diversify and import from various sources to remain resilient in times of disease outbreaks and supply disruptions. As of last year, 30 countries are allowed to export poultry to Singapore. The Animal and Veterinary Service (AVS) and the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) conduct regular inspections of imported birds. The agencies also reminded veterinarians and bird owners to look out for any possible infections in their birds. They added that those working in close contact with birds are advised to observe good personal hygiene and take necessary measures such as wearing protective equipment. Animal rescue services, for instance, have procedures in place to mitigate risks of disease transmission while handling wildlife, including birds. “Our protocol is – we must wear gloves. For pigeons and (other birds), we'll wear masks, usually N95 masks and a face shield if needed,” said Mr Joe Kam, a wildlife specialist at JK Wildlife. The licensed NParks contractor handles an average of 15 dead or injured birds each week. After handling animals, officers are required to clean and sanitise their hands and disinfect equipment. MINIMISE HUMAN-WILDLIFE INTERACTION Mr Kam said members of the public must also do their part. Feeding remains one of the biggest interaction between humans and wildlife in Singapore, he said, adding that such close contact carries risks of disease transmission. “To minimise human-wildlife interaction, we have to manage our food provision, which includes feeding and waste management. We have to minimise animals coming to us for food, looking into the bins, etc,” Mr Kam noted. “Birds congregate because of the food, (when humans feed them). So, please do not feed the birds.” Feeding wildlife – including birds – can dirty the surroundings and invite pests, according to NParks. Those caught feeding wildlife in Singapore can be fined up to S$10,000 (US$7,400). A sign warns against the feeding of birds in a public space in Singapore. A wildlife specialist said feeding remains one of the biggest source of interaction between humans and wildlife, adding that such close contact carries risks of disease transmission. AVIAN FLU TRANSMISSIONS ARE RARE Still, migratory birds can fly above border controls and bring avian viruses. However, experts say bird-to-human transmissions are relatively rare. Ms Veronica Foo, chairperson of the bird group at Nature Society Singapore said migratory birds do not congregate at farms or crowded areas. Instead, they are usually found at open water sources including ponds, lakes and reservoirs, such as Kranji Marshes or Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve. She said agencies are keeping an eye on migratory birds’ activities at hotspots. “We have a concerted multi task force of agencies which has set up a surveillance network to ensure that biosecurity measures are in place,” she said. “They will do checks on the water and migratory birds, like taking samples of the faecal matter, and test to make sure that they are free from the virus.” SAFE TO VISIT BIRD PARADISE Meanwhile, the Mandai Wildlife Group said that visiting Bird Paradise and the Singapore Zoo remains safe. The parks have strict biosecurity measures in place that include regular health checks, disease screening and quarantines to ensure birds are healthy and prevent outbreaks. Authorities also warned those travelling to take extra precautions, especially when visiting countries with reported cases. The Health Ministry (MOH) is strongly advising travellers not to go to live bird markets or dairy farms when abroad, and not to consume uncooked meat or raw milk. This is because other animals like cows can also catch the bird flu. Herds of cattle in several US states were detected with the virus last month, and at least three dairy farm workers were infected. The World Health Organization (WHO) has voiced concerns over the H5N1’s growing spread among wild birds, poultry, and cattle. However, it said public health risk continues to be low. Since 2021, there have been 28 reported cases in humans worldwide, but no human-to-human transmission. MOH said avian influenza viruses do not easily infect humans and other mammals. Almost all human cases of avian influenza reported overseas have had close contact with infected birds and poultry, or contaminated environments. If any member of the public spots a suspected case, they can report it to AVS via its website or hotline.

Biju E Paul, Manoj ViswanathanUpdated on: 16 Jun 2024, 3:36 am3 min readCopiedALAPPUZHA : Amid the spread of Avian Influenza— popularly known as bird flu— among domestic birds in three districts, the death of crows, cranes, and a hawk in Alappuzha district is causing concern.Experts have warned that the spread of the disease to wild birds can pose a threat to humans, particularly in the backdrop of the infection confirmed in a four-year-old child in West Bengal.Around 25 crows were found dead in in Muhamma panchayat of Alappuzha district two days ago and a few cranes in the Cherthala area. On Saturday, the carcass of a hawk was found in the district. The samples have been sent to the National Institute of High-Security Animal Disease (NIHSAD), Bhopal for testing.According to the animal husbandry department (AHD), 29,589 birds were found dead at 19 places spread over the districts of Alappuzha, Pathanamthitta and Kottayam during the past two-and-a-half months. The outbreak was reported in the state on April 16, 2024. As part of the efforts to contain the outbreak, the department has culled 1,09,250 domestic birds, including ducks, broiler chicken and quails. Besides, 14,732 eggs and 15,221 kg of poultry feed were destroyed.“The spread of bird flu is a cause for concern, and we have taken steps to contain the disease. The spread of the disease to wild birds like crows is worrying. According to reports, the virus is spread by migratory birds. We have formed a team of experts to study the cause for the spread of the disease and recommend ways to contain it,” Minister for Animal Husbandry J Chinchurani told TNIE. Avian Influenza threat19 places in Alappuzha, Kottayam, P’Thitta districtsOutbreak reported on April 16, 2024Efforts to contain spread29,589 bird deaths reported 1,09,250 domestic birds culled14,732 eggs destroyed15,221 kg of poultry feed destroyed.Call for study to identify source of bird flu outbreak“The team consists of experts from the Kerala Veterinary and Animal Sciences University, State Institute for Animal Diseases, and the Avian Disease Diagnostic Laboratory. The report is expected to be submitted in two weeks,” she said.However, Ornithologist R Sugathan has disputed the claim of AHD that the Avian Influenza is spread by migratory birds. “The bird flu was first reported in the state in 2014, and it has been reported almost every year since then. While working at Thattekad, I had collected more than 3,000 samples of bird droppings and saliva which were sent to Bhopal laboratory for testing. Not a single sample tested positive. I suspect the virus spreading through domestic bird species,” he said.“The virus may be remaining dormant in some native bird species and becoming active when the conditions become favourable. The migratory birds arrive by October and leave by March every year. If the outbreak is caused by migratory birds, it should start at least in December. The government should initiate a study to identify the source of the outbreak,” said Sugathan.Pookode Veterinary and Animal Sciences College professor Chintu Ravishankar had conducted a study on the spread of Avian Influenza a few years ago, collecting samples from around 600 migratory birds from Kannur to Thiruvananthapuram. However, the presence of virus was not found in the samples.According to AHD Alappuzha district officer Joy Francis, this is the first time the disease has been confirmed in wild birds.“The death of cranes and hawks in various places in the Cherthala taluk is alarming. The department cannot cull the crows as they live in the wild, posing challenges in preventing the disease from spreading. People should stop the practice of throwing waste in public places to prevent the disease from spreading,” he said.Health department issues guidelinesHealth Minister Veena George said the department has issued special guidelines (SOP) and technical guidelines regarding bird flu in the state. The guidelines were issued as per the decision of the State Rapid Response Team (RRT) headed by the minister. Guidelines to be followed by farmers, poultry breeders and related persons have been issued. Those who arrive at hospitals with symptoms like severe body pain, fever, cough and breathlessness will be specially monitored. Veena said social awareness will be created and preventive measures will be taken under the leadership of trained One Health community volunteers in Alappuzha, Pathanamthitta and Kottayam districts.Follow The New Indian Express channel on WhatsApp Download the TNIE app to stay with us and follow the latestBird fluCherthalaShow CommentsRelated StoriesNo stories found.

Tabassum Barnagarwala Jun 20, 2024 · 06:30 am Read in App File photo: Health workers carry culled poultry for disposal at Gandhigram village in Tripura. | Jayanta Dey/ Reuters In January, a four-year-old girl from West Bengal’s Malda district, who was recovering from a respiratory infection, fell ill.Her parents took her to a local paediatrician in Kaliachak on January 26.On February 1, she was admitted in the paediatric intensive care unit in a Malda hospital after she developed respiratory distress, high-grade fever and intense stomach cramps.A day later, she tested positive for the influenza B virus and adenovirus. It took her the whole month to recover and get discharged.But within days, the symptoms reemerged. She was then referred to Kolkata’s Nil Ratan Sircar Medical College and Hospital for respiratory distress.This time, her nasal swab tested positive for influenza A virus and rhinovirus. The sample was referred to Pune’s National Institute of Virology, which detected the avian flu virus – the H9N2 subtype of influenza A virus – in her.Avian influenza generally infects poultry and birds. Some cases of avian influenza have been reported in humans, though it is a rare occurrence.This is the second such case from India. The first was reported in 2019, when a 17-month-old boy tested positive in Melghat, a tribal hamlet in Maharashtra’s Amravati district.The two cases have not led to any human-to-human infection.But is there a potential risk of an outbreak? Experts Scroll spoke to said the risk of infection due to avian flu remains low in India as long as human-to-human transmission has not been established.‘Source of infection unknown’Since 2006, over 99 cases of the H9N2 virus in humans have been reported to the World Health Organisation from China, Vietnam, Bangladesh, Hong Kong, Oman, Senegal, Pakistan and Cambodia. This includes at least two deaths.While a press release from the World Health Organisation on June 11 stated that the child was infected by poultry near her house, officials in Bengal told Scroll there is no poultry farm in the surrounding neighbourhood.“The source of infection remains unknown,” said Dr Dipankar Majhi, state surveillance officer in West Bengal, who visited Malda to monitor the situation. “There is no history of migration of birds in that period either.”The child remained in the Kolkata medical college for over two months. She was finally discharged on May 1, but continues to require oxygen support at home.Avian influenza in humans is known to cause mild illness. In the four-year-old’s case, however, the respiratory distress continued for four months.“That is because she already had a past history of lung infection before she caught this infection. Her health was already weak,” said Majhi. The child remained in the Kolkata medical college for over two months. She was finally discharged on May 1, but continues to require oxygen support at home.Contact tracingDr Siddhartha Niyogi, director of health services in West Bengal, said no new cases of human infection have been found in the area in the last five months.Majhi said they began tracing close contacts of the girl, including her family, neighbours and the medical staff that treated her. “We tested symptomatic cases and did not find any positive avian flu case,” Majhi told Scroll. Asymptomatic contacts were not tested.The animal husbandry department also began to screen poultry, wild birds and animals in the neighbourhood.Between April and June, it tested 1,728 samples – all of them tested negative for the virus subtype.The state health department, however, conducted no sewage water testing. Checking for the presence of the H9N2 virus in wastewater could highlight the extent of its spread in a locality.Low risk of outbreakBoth the WHO and the state health department have labelled the risk of a possible outbreak as low.The previous case of Melghat from 2019, where a 17-month-old boy was diagnosed with the virus after developing fever, cough, and breathlessness, was the only other confirmed case in the country. While the infant was not exposed to contaminated poultry, his parents had traveled for a religious gathering a week before he developed symptoms.His father, too, had similar symptoms when he returned but was never tested. No other case in the neighbourhood was diagnosed.“It is hard to make much out of purely isolated cases,” said Dr Anurag Agrawal, former director of the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology and now dean of bio-sciences and health research, Ashoka University.“Human-to-human transmission is what you worry about. It has not been established that this subtype can transmit from one human to another,” Agrawal added.For that to happen, he said, the virus will need further mutation and a high viral load in the upper respiratory tract of humans.While the risk posed by H9N2 is low, other subtypes of avian influenza have been swiftly adapting and mutating.The subtype H5N1, for instance, has jumped to mammals such as foxes, ferrets, seals, cats, bears and skunks. Recently, the USA reported 47 cases of H5N1 infection in mice, which brings them closer to infecting human beings.“The more animals the virus infects, the more likely it is to acquire mutations which we don’t want,” Agrawal said.The fact that H5N1 subtype is able to infect mice makes the risk for humans greater. “But influenza is not a new virus and right now there is nothing to suggest alarm of any kind,” Agrawal said. The latest series of cases is only proof that the virus lives amongst us, he added.Gautam Menon, head of the Centre for Climate Change and Sustainability in Ashoka University, however, warned that “the presence of this virus in household animals suggests the need for caution, given the larger possibility of exposure.”Menon added that one worry that remains in the scientific world is of “reassortment”. “If a pig were infected with a human influenza A virus and an avian influenza A virus at the same time, then reassortment of different parts of these viruses could produce a new influenza virus that might then be able to infect humans and spread easily from person to person,” he explained.If such a virus is able to spread, it can pose a risk of an outbreak or pandemic. “Surveillance is important, including sequencing of viruses from humans and animals infected with avian influenza A viruses, to identify such a possibility,” Menon said.Dr Chitra Pattabiraman, genomic epidemiology and infectious diseases researcher pointed out that there is an ongoing outbreak of avian influenza in North and South America, with an increased number of mammals getting infected. Within India, however, such cases are yet to be reported.“Currently human infections with avian influenza are very rare,” she said. “Many states in India, including Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Kerala and Jharkhand, have reported recent outbreaks of bird flu but no associated human cases have been reported. That means there are no red flags for now,” she said.This reporting was supported by a grant from the Thakur Family Foundation.

As almost all human cases of bird flu, or avian influenza, reported overseas involved close contact with infected birds and poultry, or contaminated environments, the best prevention is to avoid exposure to such sources, said the ministry. It urged the public to avoid direct contact with wild birds and domestic poultry that could be infected with bird flu viruses. Birds are not the only animal source of infection. There have been recent cases of humans contracting bird flu in the US after coming into contact with infected cows. Endemic in avian populations in South-east Asia, bird flu is always a threat in the region and the mortality rate is high, said infectious diseases specialist Leong Hoe Nam. The World Health Organisation (WHO) raised concerns in April about the spread of H5N1 bird flu, which its chief scientist Jeremy Farrar said has an “extraordinarily high” mortality rate in humans. From 2003 to 2024, 889 cases of bird flu were reported and more than half of these, or 463 cases, were fatal. This translates to a fatality rate of 52 per cent and the deaths, caused by the H5N1 virus, were reported in 23 countries worldwide, said WHO. “We must constantly be... vigilant, as (bird flu) can land on our shores either through migratory birds or travellers transiting through... Singapore,” Dr Leong said. Recent cases of humans contracting bird flu in the US after coming into contact with infected cows highlight the fact that infection can come from animals other than birds. PHOTO: NYTIMES Despite the recent spate of human bird flu cases, an MOH spokesman said that avian influenza viruses have not developed the capability to easily infect humans and other mammals, nor to transmit easily between humans. Professor Hsu Li Yang, vice-dean of global health and programme leader of infectious diseases at the NUS Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, said: “The human cases occur primarily in those who were in close contact with infected animals, be they birds or cattle (in the case of the US).” He said the human cases of avian influenza in the US, Mexico and Australia were not caused by the same strain of virus. “Currently, these viruses are not able to spread between humans easily, which limits the outbreak or pandemic potential,” he said. Singapore is a stopover spot for migratory birds on the East Asian-Australasian Flyway, the world’s largest migratory route stretching from the Arctic Circle to Australia and New Zealand, said Prof Hsu, but the risk of exposure to bird flu from these wild birds is minimal. The risk of contracting avian influenza from food sources is negligible in Singapore, he said. While bird flu viruses can be found in food products from infected animals, proper cooking and pasteurisation of milk remove any risk of infection, he added. “The Singapore Food Agency rigorously checks sources of food imports, and local egg producers also ensure that their flocks are not in contact with wild birds,” he said. Dr Leong said that Singapore has good and accessible healthcare facilities, diagnostic capabilities and a contact-tracing system in place. Under the law, doctors and laboratories here are required to report suspected and confirmed human cases of avian influenza to MOH immediately so that prompt action can be taken to safeguard the public. Travellers visiting countries with reported cases or outbreaks of avian influenza should practise good hygiene and avoid visiting live bird markets and dairy farms, MOH advises. They should avoid direct contact with sick or dead birds and animals, and avoid consuming raw or unprocessed animal products such as undercooked meat and unpasteurised milk. The ministry also advises anyone who is unwell to seek prompt medical treatment and to inform the doctor of his travel history and any exposure to bird flu. For more information on bird flu, members of the public can refer to the avian influenza page on the MOH website.

The results of the pathology test will allow people to act quickly to purchase antiviral medication that could shorten the length and severity of the flu or Covid.Epidemiologist, Professor Adrian Esterman, points to fatigue over Covid-era rules as a key reason for the high case numbers.'Fewer and fewer people are protecting themselves with face masks and handwashing and because of that, people are more exposed to the flu than this time last year,' he told 7NEWS. Aussies who come down with a sniffle will know within 24 hours whether it's the flu, Covid, a common cold or one of 14 different respiratory viruses, thanks to a new Aussie test 'The second reason is there's been a bit of an early start to the flu season in the Northern Hemisphere.

(chinadaily.com) (Istimewa) Jakarta (ANTARA) - Indonesia has intensified measures such as surveillance and is pursuing other efforts to prevent avian influenza in humans following a report from the World Health Organization (WHO) on a recent infection. In a statement received here on Friday, director for surveillance and health quarantine at the Health Ministry, Achmad Farchanny Tri Adryanto, said that the ministry is consistently monitoring the avian influenza strain which can infect humans. "As per global commitment, in human health sector, strains which are monitored are HPAI (highly pathogenic avian influenza) or H5 at fourth tier Public Health Laboratory, or LPAI (low pathogenic avian influenza) comprising H7, H9, and others, at National Referral Public Health Laboratory," Adryanto informed. He said that based on the WHO's June 11, 2024, report, a type-A Avian Influenza (H9N2) case was detected in a child from West Bengal, India. The child, who contracted the infection after coming in contact with an avian source of the virus, has recovered and gone home from hospital. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), HPAI and LPAI cause mild to severe infections in humans, he said. HPAI causes a high mortality rate in avians, he informed. Meanwhile, upon being infected with LPAI, avians show little to no signs. He said that to detect suspected infections early, the monitoring of avian influenza is focusing on influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infections (SARI), which can arise from direct contact with sick or dead avians in contaminated environments. The surveillance has also been extended to national entryways, like airports and harbors, and is focused on travelers arriving from countries that have reported cases of avian influenza. Related news: Risk of avian influenza infection in humans still low: govt He appealed to farmers rearing chickens, cows, or any other livestock to employ hygienic and sanitary management on their farms and to always disinfect and wash their hands. He also asked them not to sell sick livestock and to immediately report any sudden mass death of livestock. Adryanto also appealed to the public to always follow a healthy and clean lifestyle, for instance, by washing hands after coming in contact with avians, in order to avoid infection. "(This further includes) Not consuming sick animals or avians, using sufficient protective equipment during contact with avians or mammals, which are sick or suddenly dead," he added. He said that avian influenza infection in humans occurs due to contact with avians or animals that are sick or infected with the pathogens as well as through poorly cooked meals sourced from contaminated areas. According to him, the clinical symptoms of avian influenza are akin to normal flu. Other likely symptoms include sneezing, headache, muscle soreness, digestive problems, and shortness of breath. Shortness of breath points to declining lower respiratory system health, which can worsen, he said. "Immediately go to health facilities if you experience avian influenza symptoms and have (recently) come in contact with risk factors," he added.

Picture NCA NewsWire / Gaye Gerard NSW records large increase in flu cases, concerning jump in ER admissions By: NCA Newswire in Clinical Practice, Top Stories June 17, 2024 0 NSW is headed for a “more severe flu season than usual” with the state recording a 25 per cent week-on-week surge in cases. The latest NSW Health Respiratory Surveillance Report detailed a 22 per cent jump in people presenting to hospital emergency departments with flu-like illnesses. NSW Chief Health Officer Kerry Chant said health authorities expected the flu figures to remain high for “several weeks to come”. “Flu is rapidly increasing across the state,” she said. Dr Chant also urged Australians over 65 to get their free vaccination, with just 52.4 per cent of people in the age group currently vaccinated. Two weeks ago, it was reported to be under the 50 per cent mark. “This is particularly important for people aged 65 and over who are at higher risk of severe illness from influenza, and unfortunately our vaccination rates for this group still aren’t where we need them to be,” Dr Chant said. Thursday’s report also warned community transmission of Covid-19 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are also high, with 5370 new cases of Covid-19, 6722 new cases of influenza, and 2502 of RSV in the week to June 8. Cases of Covid-19 were highest in the 65+ age group, while younger age groups dominated notifications of RSV and the flu. Issuing a broad warning, NSW Health asked people not to visit high-risk settings, like hospitals and aged-care homes if they were symptomatic. NSW Health Minister Ryan Park echoed Dr Chant’s comments, and warned the state was expecting a “more severe flu season than usual”. “We know that this is also being reflected in our emergency department presentations,” he said. “But there are very simple steps we can take to reduce the spread and protect each other, and that’s to get your flu jab. “They are free for eligible patients and you can access them from your GP or pharmacist.” Do you have an idea for a story?

The government will continue its testing at sites.”About 87,000 birds at the farms are being culled, a process expected to take at least three more days.Eggs and poultry meat are safe to eat, the government said.The last bird flu outbreak in NSW was in 2013, when it was eliminated by bird culls and exclusion zones.SaveLog in, register or subscribe to save articles for later.License this articleBiosecurityRural propertyBen Cubby is an investigative reporter for The Sydney Morning Herald.Connect via Twitter or email.Most Viewed in NationalLoadingFrom our partnersLoading 3rd party ad contentLoading 3rd party ad contentLoading 3rd party ad contentLoading 3rd party ad contentAdvertisementThe Sydney Morning HeraldTwitterFacebookInstagramRSSOur SitesThe Sydney Morning HeraldThe AgeBrisbane TimesWAtodayThe Australian Financial ReviewDomainDriveClassifiedsTributesCelebrationsPlace your adCommercial Real EstateThe Sydney Morning HeraldContact & supportAdvertise with usNewslettersAccessibility guideSitemapPhoto salesPurchase front pagesContent licensingWork with usTerms of usePrivacy policyPress CouncilCharter of Editorial IndependenceProducts & ServicesSubscription packagesMy accountSubscriber FAQsDelivery statusToday’s PaperGood Food GuideDaily PuzzlesCopyright © 2024SubscribeWarning as surging flu cases, hospital visits squeeze NSW health systemWatch TVNewsSportLifestyleTravelEntertainmentProduct ReviewsCouponsStanDomainDriveConnect with us Search NationalNSWVICQLDSAWAACTTASNTLatestUS Election 2024Israel-HamasCrimeTechnologyHealthFinanceExplainersCost of LivingPoliticsWorldAsiaEuropeNZUKUSAChinaAfricaVideosLiveToday ShowACA60 MinutesSportOlympicsAFLCricketFootballLive scoresNRLWeatherFinanceBusiness newsFind and comparePersonal financeSmall businessCelebrityEntertainment newsCelebrityRoyal newsTV guideAppApp StoreGoogle PlayMeet The TeamAbout 9NewsContact usMeet the teamPrivacyTerms of useYour location:SYDNEYSYDNEY, NSWPERTH, WAMELBOURNE, VICHOBART, TASBRISBANE, QLDDARWIN, NTADELAIDE, SACANBERRA, ACTYour web browser is no longer supported.
