During the COVID-19 pandemic, flu cases have dropped significantly due to public health measures such as mask wearing and social distancing, as the flu is transmitted similarly to the coronavirus. The drop in flu numbers has been global and swift.
In the 2020-2021 season, there were only about 700 deaths from influenza in the US, compared to approximately 22,000 deaths in the prior season and 34,000 deaths two seasons ago.
The upcoming flu vaccine for the 2021-2022 season is based on strains that have been circulating with fewer cases than normal, but the reduced chance of mutation due to less virus circulating could make the vaccine especially effective.
Public health experts hope that continued hand washing, face covering, and temporary social distancing measures can lead to less severe flu seasons even as health restrictions are lifted and people gather together again.
