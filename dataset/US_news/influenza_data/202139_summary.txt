- The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a significant reduction in influenza cases globally, including both influenza A and B viruses.
- The B/Yamagata lineage of influenza B virus has not been isolated from April 2020 to August 2021, suggesting that it may have become extinct.
- This extinction of the B/Yamagata lineage may provide opportunities for improving the availability and effectiveness of influenza vaccines.
- Infection with the B/Yamagata lineage of influenza B virus accounts for about a quarter of the annual influenza burden.
- The reduction in influenza cases is likely due to behavioral changes such as social distancing, mask wearing, and hygiene measures, as well as travel and movement restrictions implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic.
- The genetic diversity of influenza viruses has also significantly diminished during the pandemic.
- It is unclear whether the extinction of the B/Yamagata lineage is permanent or temporary. Further monitoring and research are needed to determine the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on influenza lineages.
