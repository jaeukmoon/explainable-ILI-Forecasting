Here, we describe a chimeric monoclonal antibody, C12H5, that offers neutralization against seasonal and pandemic H1N1 viruses, and cross-protection against some H5N1 viruses. Notably, C12H5 mAb offers broad neutralizing activity against H1N1 and H5N1 viruses by controlling virus entry and egress, and offers protection against H1N1 and H5N1 viral challenge in vivo. Through structural analyses, we show that C12H5 engages hemagglutinin (HA), the major surface glycoprotein on influenza, at a distinct epitope overlapping the receptor binding site and covering the 140-loop. We identified eight highly conserved (~90%) residues that are essential for broad H1N1 recognition, with evidence of tolerance for Asp or Glu at position 190; this site is a molecular determinant for human or avian host-specific recognition and this tolerance endows C12H5 with cross-neutralization potential. Our results could benefit the development of antiviral drugs and the design of broad-protection influenza vaccines.

Over the past five decades, seasonal influenza caused by influenza A viruses H1N1 and H3N2, and influenza B Yamagata and Victoria lineages, has led to the deaths of 250,000–500,000 people annually worldwide1. The influenza A virus is associated with higher morbidity and mortality rates than other influenza virus types and has a higher potential to cause a pandemic spread worldwide. Indeed, the historic 1918 Spanish H1N1 pandemic caused death to nearly one-third of the world’s population (at least 40 million people)2. More recently, the outbreak of the novel pandemic influenza (H1N1) virus was first detected in Mexico in April 2009 and rapidly spread worldwide, with cases confirmed in over 200 countries. By August 6, 2010, the pandemic had resulted in 18,449 confirmed deaths3. Over the past decade, the virus associated with the 2009 H1N1 pandemic has remained a seasonal, annual hazard. Indeed, there have been serious pandemic threats from several highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses, such as H5N1, H5N6, and H7N9, which are also responsible for severe respiratory disease, with high mortality rates (~60%)4. Given the unpredictable nature of these viruses and their potential to spawn widespread disease, the most effective countermeasure to combat influenza is a vaccine. Antiviral drugs, by comparison, have a narrow therapeutic window, with increased resistance and thus diminishing efficacy over time. However, despite vaccines being a better choice, influenza viruses vary considerably, and the current seasonal vaccine runs the risk of mismatch against newer, circulating strains. This therefore requires the development of next-generation vaccines that can elicit broad and/or cross-type protection against influenza.Most broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) recognize hemagglutinin (HA), the major surface glycoprotein on influenza viruses5. HA mediates virus attachment to the host cell through the receptor-binding site (RBS) on the globular head region of HA1. The virus engages with sialic acid lining the cell surface, which leads to its subsequent pH-dependent entry through endosomal fusion. This fusion and entry is mediated by the fusion peptide on the HA stem region of HA2.There are 18 antigenically distinct HA subtypes (H1-H18) of influenza A virus, generated as a result of rapid and continuous antigenic drift6,7. Heterosubtypic bnAbs can bind to multiple HA subtypes8,9,10,11,12,13,14. For instance, CR6261 antibody targets a highly conserved region in the HA stem domain and offers broad-protection against influenza A group 1 viruses11. In contrast, bnAb CR9114, which binds to a conserved epitope on the stem domain, can protect against lethal challenge with both influenza A and B viruses15. The successes in these studies offer a new strategy for preventing and treating influenza virus infection and provide hope for the development of a universal influenza vaccine.Most of the cross-reactive antibodies produced to date map to the stem region of HA. However, there are a few cross-subtype nAbs that target the HA globular head, and these antibodies are usually more potent and immunodominant than stem antibodies; albeit, nAbs that target the HA globular head show a more limited neutralization breadth. Specifically, C0516, S139/117, and F045-09218, which target the conserved epitope on the HA head region, are reported to be cross-reactive against H1, H2, and H3 subtypes. CH6519, 5J820, and Ab664921, by comparison, are considered H1N1 bnAbs, none of which show cross-subtype reactivity. CH65 and 5J8 target the RBS, and 5J8 and Ab6649 have been shown to offer broadly neutralizing reactivity against seasonal and pandemic H1N1.In this study, we isolated and characterized a broadly neutralizing H1N1 mAb—hereafter referred to as 12H5—and generated its human-mouse chimeric version, C12H5. We show that C12H5 neutralizes seasonal H1N1 (sel H1N1), the 2009 pandemic H1N1 (pdm H1N1), as well as the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1 in vitro. It also protects mice against H1N1 and H5N1 challenge in vivo. Through crystal structure and cryo-EM structure analyses of the 12H5 Fab in complex with the HA protein, we show that 12H5 targets the RBS conserved epitope. Using structure-guided mutagenesis, we identified eight highly conserved key residues involved in the neutralization. Our study suggests that C12H5 is a promising candidate for prophylactic and therapeutic countermeasures against H1N1 and H5N1 viruses. The cross-subtype neutralizing epitope provides a structural blueprint for the design of broadly protective vaccines against influenza A virus infection.ResultsAn antibody 12H5 cross-neutralizes H1N1 and H5N1 viruses in vitro and in vivoMice were sequentially immunized intranasally or subcutaneously with live viruses of three representative strains of influenza A H1N1—A/Hong Kong/134801/1994 (HK/1994), A/New Caledonia/20/1999 (NC/1999), and A/Brisbane/59/2007 (BR/2007)—as immunogens for mAb production using standard hybridoma technology, as previously described22 (see Methods). MAb 12H5 (IgG1) immediately stood out as an excellent antibody candidate in terms of seasonal H1N1 HA specificity, and was the only mAb to neutralize most of the tested viruses in all of the assays (see Methods).We then tested the potential cross-reactivity of mAb 12H5 against several other influenza A virus strains (H1, H3, and H5) using hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) and microneutralization (MN) assays (Supplementary Table 1). We found that mAb 12H5 could neutralize nearly all annual H1N1 viruses (isolated years 1991 to 2015), including several vaccine strains; albeit the degree of neutralization varied amongst the different strains. Interestingly, mAb 12H5 also showed neutralizing activities against all tested 2009 pandemic H1N1 viruses and three avian H5N1 viruses, A/Chicken/Hong Kong/YU22/2002 (HK/2002, clade 8), A/Bar-headed Goose/Qinghai/15 C/2005 (QH/2005, clade 2) and A/Xinjiang/1/2006 (XJ/2006, clade 2) (Supplementary Table 1). Here again, 12H5 showed a wide range of neutralizing activity, with particularly high neutralization for H1N1 viruses isolated between years 1991 and 1999. Moreover, 12H5 showed great neutralization breadth; albeit, again, with different potencies against the different strains.We then investigated the protective potential of mAb 12H5 against H1N1 and H5N1 virus infection in a mouse model. Groups of 6- to 8-week-old female mice (n = 5) were challenged with lethal doses of mouse-adapted (MA) influenza A viruses—MA-A/California/07/2009 (MA-CA7/2009, pdm H1N1) and MA-A/Bar-headed Goose/Qinghai/2005 (MA-QH/2005, H5N1)—and then treated with different doses of 12H5 or PBS (placebo) at 1 day after infection. The protection efficacy of 12H5 was dose-dependent: 5 mg/kg of 12H5 IgG protected 100% of mice from death and prevented substantial weight loss against lethal challenge with either MA-CA7/2009 (Fig. 1a, b) or MA-QH/2005 (Fig. 1c, d), whereas a lower dose (2.5 mg/kg) still afforded protection to some extent, with 50% to 60% survival rates (Fig. 1b, d). All of the PBS-treated control animals exhibited continuous weight loss following virus challenge and died within 10 days after infection. These results indicate that passive immunization with mAb 12H5 provided heterosubtypic protection against pandemic H1N1 and H5N1 viruses in mice.Fig. 1: In vivo therapeutic efficacy of 12H5 in mice and in vitro neutralization and binding activity of C12H5.a–d Therapeutic efficacy of 12H5 against lethal challenge of MA-CA7/2009 (a, b), and MA-QH/2005 (c, d).

The result showed 12H5 aligns with a KV3-4 and HV9-1 germline V gene and its nucleotide identity is 98.28% (286/291 nt) for the VL chain and 95.83% (276/288 nt) for the VH chain (Supplementary Fig. 1). To evaluate the potential clinical application of 12H5, we constructed and carried out further characterizations using a chimeric 12H5 monoclonal antibody—designated C12H5—that contains the variable region of mouse 12H5 and the human IgG1 Fc region.C12H5 cross-neutralizes H1N1 and H5N1 viruses in vitroTo further profile the breadth of activity of C12H5 against influenza A viruses, we first tested C12H5 with recombinant HA proteins from two seasonal H1N1 strains, two pandemic H1N1 strains, three H5N1 strains, and one type B strain using ELISA. C12H5 showed high reactivities with all H1N1 and H5N1 HAs, with half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) values ranging from 7.9 to 186.5 ng/mL (Fig. 1e). In contrast, the control antibody C12G6 (a broadly chimeric mAb against influenza B viruses from our previous study23) did not react with any of the influenza A viruses except for the B/Florida/4/2006 (FL/2006) control (Fig. 1e). Next, C12H5 binding was measured against three representative strains of HA using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). C12H5 showed strong affinities to sel A/Bejing/262/1995 (BJ/1995) HA and pdm A/California/04/2009 (CA4/2009) HA, with affinity constants (KD) of 8.1 nM and 24.85 nM, respectively (Fig. 1f). Most notably, C12H5 showed heterosubtypic binding activity to H5 QH/2005 HA with a KD of 127 nM (Fig. 1f), indicating a moderate interaction but one that is within the range that has been reported to effectively neutralize the virus (KD < 250 nM) (Fig. 1f)17, while its relatively fast off rate might restrict its effectiveness and potency in some assays. Consistent with its reactivities to H1N1 and H5N1 viruses, C12H5 also showed binding to Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells pre-infected with sel H1N1 NC/1999, CA4/2009, and QH/2005 viruses in an immunofluorescence assay (Supplementary Fig. 2).We then compared C12H5 with six previously reported subtype-specific or cross-subtype neutralizing influenza A HA-specific bnAbs: 5J820, CH6519, Ab664921, CR626111, F1012, and FI624. First, we generated chimeric forms of the antibodies, as done for C12H5, with all chimeric versions demonstrating good binding activity against H1 or H5 virus HA, consistent with the original reports (Supplementary Fig. 3 and Table 2). Using these chimeras, we showed that the 5J8 antibody offered HAI activities against most of the sel H1 and all of the pdm H1 strains, but not against NC/1999, BJ/1995, BR/2007, or three H5N1 viruses. Of all the antibodies, CH65 displayed the most robust HAI activity but only to the seasonal H1 strains. 5J8 also showed just as robust activities to the pdm H1N1 strains, CH65 and 5J8 both did better against many viruses compared to C12H5 within these subgroups (Fig. 1g). Comparatively, Ab6649 exhibited moderate HAI activity to sel H1N1 and pdm H1N1 but not to H5N1 viruses. And, finally, none of CR6261, F10, or FI6 showed HAI activity against any of the influenza A viruses, most likely due to their stem specificity. In contrast, our chimeric C12H5, however, showed high HAI activity against all major seasonal H1N1 viruses except for SI/2006 and BR/2007, and moderate HAI activities against pandemic H1N1 and three H5N1 strains (Fig. 1g).In the MN assay, C12H5, CR6261, F10, and FI6 antibodies neutralized both H1 and H5 viruses with varied potency (Fig. 1h and Supplementary Fig. 4), whereas 5J8, CH65, Ab6649, and CR6261 were unable to neutralize some strains. Overall, the mean log IC50 value for C12H5 against the panel of virus strains is not significantly different to that of 5J8 and CH65; however, unlike the broad neutralization breadth of C12H5, 5J8 was unable to neutralize four of the seasonal H1N1 strains and the two H5N1 strains, and CH65 was incapable of neutralizing all of the tested pdm H1N1 strains and the two H5N1 strains (Fig. 1h and Supplementary Fig. 4). On the other hand, the mean log IC50 value for C12H5 is significantly lower than that for Ab6649, CR6261 and the control antibody, C12G6, suggesting that C12H5 is more potent than Ab6649 and CR6261 at least in this assay. Meanwhile, C12H5 exhibited broad-spectrum neutralization activity against all representative H1 strains, with a median IC50 of 5.75 μg/mL, as compared with that for F10 and FI6 (7.72 and 13.45 μg/mL, respectively) (Supplementary Fig. 4). Moreover, C12H5 exclusively offered cross-neutralization against the H5N1 virus; none of other H1 head-region antibodies recognized H5 (Fig. 1h and Supplementary Fig. 4). Taken together, despite the varied neutralizing potency among the different strains, we show that C12H5 outperforms the other three reported H1 head-region bnAbs in terms of neutralization breadth and has an overall higher neutralization potency than the three stem bnAbs tested (CR6261, F10, FI6).C12H5 shows cross-type prophylactic and therapeutic activities against H1N1 and H5N1 viruses in miceWe next evaluated the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of C12H5 against the MA influenza A viruses—MA-A/New Caledonia/20/1999 (H1N1, MA-NC/1999), MA-CA4/2009, and MA-QH/2005—using different doses delivered by intravenous administration. Antibodies were administered 24 h before and after virus infection for prophylactic and therapeutic groups, respectively.In the prophylactic groups (n = 5), doses of 2.5 mg/kg and above could fully protect mice from lethal infection with sel H1N1 MA-NC/1999 and pdm H1N1 MA-CA4/2009 virus (Fig. 2a, b), with these doses also having little effect on body weight for mice in the pdm H1N1 group (Fig. 2b). Doses as low as 1 mg/kg still offered 80% survival in both H1N1 groups (Fig. 2a, b). For the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus, a dose of 10 mg/kg completely protected mice against lethal infection with MA-QH/2005 virus (Fig. 2c), whereas a lower 2.5 mg/kg dose offered partial protection, with a survival rate of 60%.Fig. 2: In vivo prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of C12H5 in mice.a to c Prophylactic efficacy of C12H5 against lethal challenge of MA-NC/1999 (a), MA-CA4/2009 (b), or MA-QH/2005 (c). Body weight (left) and survival (right) curves of BALB/c mice (n = 5 per group) treated with 10, 5, 2.5, or 1 mg/kg C12H5, or C12G6 (10 mg/kg) 24 h before lethal challenge are shown. d to f Therapeutic efficacy of C12H5 against lethal challenge with MA-NC/1999 (d), MA-CA4/2009 (e), and MA-QH/2005 (f).

The body weight curves in a–f reflect the weights of surviving mice; data pertaining to the mice that died after challenge were omitted from the body weight data. g Lung virus titers from mice treated with C12H5 (10 mg/kg) or C12G6 control (10 mg/kg) in the prophylactic group (n = 5 per group) were determined 6 days after infection. h Lung virus titers from mice treated with C12H5 (20 mg/kg) or C12G6 control (20 mg/kg) in the therapeutic group (n = 5 per group) were determined 6 days after infection. Data in a–h are presented as mean values ± SD. For survival data, the log-rank test was used to evaluate significance. For virus titers, each group was compared with the control group using a two-tailed Mann–Whitney U-test (***p < 0.001; **p < 0.01; *p < 0.05). TCID50, median tissue culture infective dose. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageIn the therapeutic groups (n = 5), 5 mg/kg and above could fully protect mice against lethal challenge with MA-NC/1999 virus; although, body weight did fluctuate but recovered during the experimental period (Fig. 2d). Mice were fully protected against a lethal infection of MA-CA4/2009 with 5 mg/kg or higher dosages, with less changes in body weight observed compared to that of MA-NC/1999 (Fig. 2e). In addition, a dose of 1 mg/kg still provided 80% protection against the virus (Fig. 2e). For the H5 virus, doses of 10 mg/kg and above effectively alleviated the weight loss observed and completely protected mice against MA-QH/2005 virus infection (Fig. 2f). The body weight loss is shifted by several days compared to that MA-NC/1999, which might be due to resulting pathogenicity varying even at the same dose of antibodies across different virus strains. Mouse survival rates were 80% with 5 mg/kg, and 60% with 1 mg/kg (Fig. 2f). Consistent with the survival data, lung viral titers were determined 6 days after virus infection and were considerably reduced in mice administered with C12H5 as compared with the control (IgG) group (Fig. 2g, h). The prophylactic and therapeutic experiments collectively indicated that C12H5 could protect mice against H1N1 and H5N1 viruses in vivo, despite less effectively to H5.To further investigate the potency of C12H5, we compared its therapeutic efficacy against other representative antibodies at two doses. We found that the lower dose of 3 mg/kg of C12H5, Ab6649, or FI6 fully protected mice from lethal challenge with MA-CA4/2009 (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 5). In contrast, 3 mg/kg of F10, 5J8, CH65 or CR6261 provided only partial or no protection against infection, with survival rates of 80%, 60%, 0%, and 20%, respectively (Fig. 3a). The potent protection achieved with C12H5, Ab6649, and FI6 was also reflected in body weight variation, with much less fluctuation in body weight curves for mice in these three groups as compared with mice treated with the other antibodies (Fig. 3b). Among the mice challenged with a lethal infection of H5N1 MA-QH/2005 virus, only those treated with C12H5 and FI6 at a dose of 15 mg/kg were fully protected, with no weight loss. Mice treated with 5J8, CH65, and Ab6649 at the same high dose all died within 2 weeks post-virus challenge (Fig. 3c, d). Consistent with the survival and body weight data, the lung virus titers for MA-CA4/2009 (pdm H1N1) and MA-QH/2005 (H5N1) were considerably lower in mice treated with C12H5 and FI6 than in those treated with the other bnAbs. Mice treated with 5J8 showed a relatively low survival rate of 60%, despite of low virus titers in the lung following MA-CA4/2009 (pdm H1N1) challenge (Fig. 3e, f).Fig. 3: Comparison of therapeutic efficacies of C12H5 and other bnAbs in mice.Survival curves (a, c), body weight changes (b, d), and lung virus titers (e, f) for BALB/c mice (n = 5 per group) treated intravenously with antibodies (3 mg/kg for MA-CA4/2009 virus, 15 mg/kg for MA-QH/2005 virus) 24 h after lethal challenge. The body weight curves reflect the weights of surviving mice; data pertaining to the mice that died after challenge were omitted from the body weight data. Virus titers in the lungs were determined 6 days after infection. Data in b, d, e, f are presented as mean values ± SD. For a, c, statistical analyses were performed using the log-rank test.

Thus, we further explored the neutralization mechanism mediated by C12H5. First, we tested whether C12H5 functions by inhibiting virus entry into MDCK cells, as determined using an immunofluorescence assay. Consistent with the HAI results, C12H5 provided inhibition against sel H1N1(NC/1999, HK/1994) and pdm H1N1 (CA4/2009, XM/2009, HK/2010) virus entry into MDCK cells (Fig. 4a). The inhibition activity against two H5N1 viruses (QH/2005, XJ/2006) was relatively weaker than that for the H1N1 virus, and this might be due to its moderate affinity to the H5N1 virus (Figs. 4a and 1f).Fig. 4: Neutralization mechanism of C12H5.a MDCK cells were inoculated with NC/1999, HK/1994, CA4/2009, XM/2009, HK/2010, QH/2005 or XJ/2006 viruses pre-incubated with C12H5 or polyclonal rabbit sera. The expression of influenza A virus nucleoprotein in MDCK cell monolayers at 16 to 18 h after inoculation was detected by immunofluorescence. Green, infected cells positive for NP protein; blue, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining. b Egress assay of influenza A virus detected in the supernatants of MDCK cells infected with NC/1999, HK/1994, CA4/2009, XM/2009, HK/2010, QH/2005, XJ/2006 or FL/2006 and subsequently incubated with different concentrations of C12H5, as indicated. Influenza A viruses were determined by Hemagglutinin assay, with the data represented as HA units. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageNext, we determined whether C12H5 inhibits influenza A virus via an alternative mechanism, such as by blocking virus egress. We carried out virus egress inhibition assays and collected the cell supernatant to determine virus titers using a hemagglutinin assay25. C12H5 at a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL inhibits the egress of all above-mentioned viruses from the infected cells except for FL/2006 strain. The control antibody C12G6 also showed no inhibition of the egress activities of H1N1 or H5N1 viruses (Fig. 4b). Thus, C12H5 exhibits similar neutralization mechanisms against the tested viruses. Specifically, we show that C12H5 exerts its antiviral activity against two seasonal and three pandemic H1N1 strains and—to a lesser extent—two H5N1 strains, by directly inhibiting the virus from attaching to the cell. Furthermore, C12H5 can effectively block virus egress, as tested with five H1 and two H5 strains but FL/2006 strain.Structural characterization of 12H5 in complex with HATo elucidate the cross-subtype neutralization function of 12H5, we prepared and resolved the crystal structure of 12H5 Fab (mouse antibody) in complex with the HA of A/California/04/2009 (H1N1) to a resolution of 3.1 Å, which will be referred to as 12H5: HAhrCA (head region of CA4/2009 HA) (Fig. 5a; Supplementary Fig. 6 and Table 3). The initial crystal sample contained a well-characterized trimer HA and Fab complex (Supplementary Fig. 7a); however, two degraded HA monomer head regions (aa 56-263; H3 numbering), each bound by a 12H5 Fab, were present in the asymmetric unit of complex. We surmise that the long-term crystallization process of ~2 months may have led to the degradation of the HA trimer (Supplementary Fig. 6e), as also observed in our previous study26. Nevertheless, the structure of the HA head region was congruent with the corresponding moiety of the CA4/2009 HA trimer structure27 (PDB code: 3lzg), as manifested by a structural superimposition of a root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 0.5 Å for all HA1 C-α atoms. We showed that the 12H5 epitope locates to the receptor-binding region (Fig. 5a).Fig. 5: Structure of 12H5:H1 HA complex.a The crystal structure of 12H5 in complex with HA of CA4/2009 (12H5 HAhrCA complex). The CA HA head region (i.e., HAhrCA) of the 12H5:HAhrCA complex was superimposed onto one protomer of a CA HA trimer (PDB code: 3lzg). The HA head region is in red, one protomer of the HA trimer is in light purple; the light chain and heavy chain of 12H5 are in light green and pink, respectively. b The overall Cryo-EM structure of 12H5 in complex with HA trimer from BJ/1995 (12H5:HABJ) at 3.15 Å resolution in side view and top view. c The 12H5:HABJ structure allowed the exact fit of the crystal structure of 12H5: HAhrCA complex. d to f Interaction analysis of 12H5: HAhrCA complex. d Close-up view of the interface of the 12H5: HAhrCA complex. e Sequence conservation of the 12H5 epitope.

The unique epitopes of 12H5, 5J8 and CH65 are colored in green, pink, and cyan, respectively. Overlapping regions are in red.Full size imageWe also solved the cryo-EM structure of 12H5 with the HA trimer of A/Beijing/262/1995 (H1N1) (12H5: HABJ; HA trimer of BJ/1995 strain) at a resolution of 3.14 Å (Fig. 5b, Supplementary Fig. 8 and Supplementary Table 4). Fitting the 12H5: HAhrCA into the model of 12H5: HABJ revealed congruency in the Fab binding orientations in the monomer HACA head region and trimer HABJ (Fig. 5c); the cryo-EM structure also confirmed that 12H5 indeed targets the RBS of different protomers within the same HA and could occupy all three potential binding sites.In the crystal structure of 12H5: HAhrCA, 12H5 interacted with the HA head region, creating a buried surface area of 827 Å2 on HA1, as calculated by PISA (Supplementary Table 5). The antibody heavy chain and light chain mediate 52% and 48% of 12H5:HAhrCA contacts, respectively (Fig. 5d and Supplementary Table 5). 12H5 primarily uses its heavy chain complementarity-determining region (HCDR)−1, HCDR2, and HCDR3 to contact HA, along with the epitope center on the negatively charged 140-loop. Its light chain (L)-CDR1, on the other hand, interacts with the negatively charged RBS groove, with contact formed primarily by the 130-loop, the 150 loop, and the 190 helix. Finally, LCDR3 makes some connections with the edge of the RBS (Fig. 5d–f). The CDRs recognition defines a non-continuous conformational epitope, mostly focusing on 130- and 140-loop stretches of residues; the sequence and secondary structure of the epitope are depicted in Fig. 5g. The epitope of 12H5 is highly conserved (89.2%) among all H1N1 isolates (n = 8907) (Fig. 5e and Supplementary Table 6). Compared with other H1-specific (5J8, CH65, CH6728, and Ab6649) or H5-specific (FLD21.14029 and AVFluIgG0330) RBS antibodies, 12H5 targets the HA RBS ~10° lower than 5J8, CH65, CH67, FLD21.140, and AVFluIgG03 when viewed along the HA trimer’s longitudinal axis, and with an ~100° rotation clockwise from Ab6649 when viewed from the top (Fig. 5h). Among these antibodies, only 12H5 covers the 140-loop (Fig. 5i). Thus, the footprint of 12H5 (827 Å2) is more membrane-proximal than 5J8 and CH65. As such, there is a 280 Å2 overlapping area across the footprints of these three antibodies (Fig. 5j). As compared with 5J8, which is most similar, C12H5 has distinctive epitope-based amino acids located within the 130- and 140-loops (Fig. 5j).12H5 mimics the receptor-binding mode of H1 and H5In the 12H5: HAhrCA structure, 12H5 makes extensive interactions with HA, creating 15 hydrogen bonds and two salt bridges, mostly with the 140-loop, 130-loop and 190 helix (Fig. 6a and Supplementary Table 5). The HCDR2 and HCDR3 make 7 hydrogen bond contacts with the H141-K145 stretch of residues, whereas LCDR3 makes two hydrogen bond contacts with K145. Collectively, these interactions account for 60% of the total hydrogen bonds (Fig. 6b). Residues H141, A142, G143, and K145 make hydrogen bonds with the heavy chain and light chain. G30cL uses its main chain to interact with the side chain of the conserved D190, and D30bL uses its side chain to interact with another two conserved residues, H183 and Y98, located on the floor of the RBS (Fig. 6c).Fig. 6: 12H5 mimics the receptor-binding mode of H1 and H5.a–d Hydrogen bonds and salt bridges between 12H5 and 140-loop (b), 130-loop (d) and other sites (D190, H183 and Y98) (c). e–h Receptor mimicry of 12H5. e Hydrogen bond interactions between the receptor analog LSTc and the H1 RBS, as shown in the co-crystal structure (PDB code: 3UBE).

The probable hydrogen bonds are shown as yellow dashed lines.Full size imageInterestingly, we found that LCDR1 of 12H5 deeply extends to the groove of HA1 RBS, which structurally mimics the interaction between H1 HA and human receptor LSTa (α 2, 6) pentasaccharide (PDB code: 3ube)31 (Fig. 6e, f). In LCDR1, the hydroxy moiety of the Y32L side chain interacts with receptor-binding site V135, T136, and A137, mediated via three hydrogen bonds; this interaction mimics the interaction of Sia-1 with the 130-loop to some extent. (Fig. 6d–f). In the 190 helix, the main chain of D30bL interacts with D190 by hydrogen bonding, similar to the interaction between GalNac-3 and D190 (Fig. 6d–f). Meanwhile, F30aL mediates hydrophobic interactions with the highly conserved W153, V155, and L194 residues, recapitulating the receptor-binding mode (Fig. 6e, f).We then aligned the 12H5 complex to the H5 receptor complex structure32 (PDB code: 4K63) and found the 12H5 LCDR1 fits well to the H5 RBS. Compared with H1, the RBS of H5 has different side chain conformations at some substitutions, such as T136S, A137S, V155I, and D190E. However, 12H5 also mimics the binding mode of H5 with the avian receptor LSTc (α 2, 3) pentasaccharide by forming favorable hydrogen bonds with residues V135-S137 and especially E190, as well as mediating hydrophobic interactions with residues W153, I155, and L194 (Fig. 6g, h). The mimicry of both H1 and H5 receptor-binding modes thus contributes to the cross-neutralizing reactivity that we see for C12H5. Our structure analysis showed that the interaction between the main chain of C12H5 G30cL and the side chain of HA1 D190 (an H1-specific site and related to host transition from human to avian, E190 for H5 instead) forms a favorable hydrogen bond. To check if E190 is also favored for the G30cL interaction, we superimposed a H5 HA structure bearing E190 residue (PDB code: 3UBE) onto the 12H5: HAhrCA immune complex structure. We found that the side chain of E190 would similarly create hydrogen bonds with the main chain of C12H5 G30cL like D190 (Supplementary Fig. 9). This structurally explains how C12H5 accommodates the D→E substitution at position 190 between H1 and H5.Sequence analysis and structure-based mutagenesis of 12H5 epitopeTo further investigate the molecular basis of binding and to identify the binding domain of C12H5, we generated C12H5-induced escape mutants of influenza H1N1 by culturing the viruses in the presence of C12H5. We identified four escape mutants: G143R in HK/1994 strain, K144T in NC/1999 strain, N142D in BR/2007 strain, and A142E in CA7/2009 strain (Fig. 7a and Supplementary Table 7). All of the mutated residues are located at or near the HA RBS of H1N1 (Fig. 5e). To ascertain the critical residues for C12H5 binding, alanine-scanning mutagenesis (Supplementary Fig. 10a) were carried out along the 15 residues of HA that were involved in mediating interactions with 12H5 in the co-crystal structure, and these mutations were checked by variations in EC50 and KD values. In the case that the residue in question was Ala, its contribution was checked by substitution with Glu (with a long side chain). Eight mutants showed dramatically lower binding reactivities to 12H5: Y98A, A137E, H141A, A142E, G143R, A144E, W153A, D190A; for these mutants, the EC50 values were more than 100 times higher than that for WT HA (Fig. 7b and Supplementary Fig. 11). SPR responses to C12H5 were also undetectable (Fig. 7c and Supplementary Table 8), consistent with the ELISA and escape mutant results. In contrast, point mutations at K133a, V135, T136, K145, V155, H183, and L194 had no significant effect on antibody binding. Interestingly, the K145A mutant showed significantly enhanced binding affinity to C12H5, with a KD value of 3.18 nM (Fig. 7c; Supplementary Fig. 12 and Table 8).Fig. 7: Interaction analysis and mutagenesis for the epitope of 12H5.a Amino acid substitutions found in the HA of C12H5-induced escape mutants with four influenza A strains. b Reactivity profiles of CA HA and its mutants against C12H5 antibodies measured through sandwich ELISA. The EC50 values were calculated by sigmoid fitting, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 11. EC50 values are plotted as circles along the horizontal axis for each protein. c Binding affinity measurements for HA and its mutants against C12H5, as determined with SPR. The kinetic constants between C12H5 and Y98A, A137E, H141A, A142E, G143R, A144E, W153A, and D190A mutants were not determinable. The calculated affinity constants and fitting results are shown in Supplementary Table 8 and Fig. 11.

Data in b–e are presented as mean values, data in f, g are presented as mean values ± SD. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageAs mentioned above (Fig. 6b–d), Y98, A137, H141, A142, G143, and D190 residues use their main chain or side chain to form hydrogen bonds, and therefore, antibody binding was abolished upon their mutation. A144 mutated to Glu with a longer side chain affected its interaction with 12H5. Additionally, W153 makes hydrophobic interactions to stabilize its contact with the RBS. Taken together, we show that eight residues are strategic for C12H5 binding to the HA RBS, six of which (Y98, A137, H141, G143, W153, D190) are highly conserved (>90%), with two residues (A142, 77.4%; A144, 73.2%) moderately conserved. Combined, these residues have an average conservation of 90% across all H1N1 isolates (Supplementary Table 6).To further investigate the structural basis of C12H5 H1 broad-neutralization and cross-neutralization to the H5N1 virus, we performed a sequence alignment and natural variation analysis for H5N1 strains (Supplementary Fig. 13; Supplementary Tables 7 and 9). The sequence analysis showed that HAs of H1N1 and H5N1 have some variable residues in the epitope region for C12H5. Specifically, we found five natural variant residues in the H5N1 strains, which may contribute to the subtype-specific binding of the H5N1 type: S133a, A137, Q142, R144, S145P (Supplementary Table 6). Thus, we also constructed these HA mutations in the QH/2005 strain and evaluated the resultant binding capacities using variations in EC50 values. We found that the substitutions S133aL and S137A led to a slight decrease the binding reactivities for C12H5, with a nearly 2-fold increase in EC50 values. The substitutions of Q142L, R144N, and S145P, however, completely abolished the binding to C12H5, with undetectable EC50 values (Fig. 7d). These results suggest that Q142, R144, and S145 are key residues for C12H5 binding to the H5N1 virus. These three key sites (Q142, R144, and S145) are moderately conserved, about 67%, among the H5N1 isolates. The two equivalent positions in the H1 strains, A142 and A144, are also essential for C12H5 binding to H1N1, despite being different residues; another position, S145 might be a specific residue for H5N1 recognition.In the 12H5: HAhrCA complex, we found that the R144N mutation could introduce N-glycosylation and result in steric occlusion with the light chain of 12H5 (Supplementary Fig. 14a). In addition, the Q142L mutation would change the electronic environment of the 140-loop (Supplementary Fig. 14b), and replacement of S145P would decrease the flexibility of the 140-loop and diminish its binding to C12H5 (Supplementary Fig. 14b). These three key sites are moderately conserved (67% among H5N1 isolates). Furthermore, based on the sequence identity of C12H5 for H1N1 and H5N1, nine (9/15) positions are preserved (i.e., the same amino acid types in both subtypes), suggesting that C12H5 may be able to tolerate high variations among the H1 and H5 strains. This likely also explains the cross-neutralization capacity of C12H5 over other nAbs, such as 5J8. For example, at the 190 position—a key site associated with virus-host specificity—Asp is observed in ~91.6% of human H1 strains and Glu in ~99.7% of avian H5N1 strains. Yet, the known D190E mutation can abolish the binding of 5J820; C12H5, however, can tolerate this polymorphism (Fig. 6f, h and Supplementary Fig. 9). We next carried out a mutagenesis analysis of the HA trimer by swapping the amino acid residue at position 190. The mutants, CA-D190E and QH-E190D, showed good reactivities against C12H5; albeit, with a 5- to 10-fold decrease in activity with respect to their corresponding wild-type HAs (Fig. 7e). Tolerance of the D/E190 polymorphism by C12H5 is also evident in the structural analysis (Supplementary Fig. 9), which illustrates the potential for the main chain of C12H5 G30cL to form favorable hydrogen bonds with the side chains of either H1-D190 or H5-E190.We next sought to explore the relevance of the C12H5-like antibody in context of human immune responses to influenza. We measured the reactivities of human sera against the C12H5 epitope using a blocking ELISA. Five serum samples were taken from H1N1-infected persons who were H1N1-RNA positive; we were unable to obtain H5N1 human sera. Sera were pre-incubated with CA4/2009 or NC/1999 HA before addition of the enzyme-labeled antibody. We found that the blocking rates of human sera against C12H5 or FI6 were 39.2% and 40.2% for CA4/2009, the rates against C12H5 or CH65 were 18.8% and 30.4% for NC/1999 HA reactions, respectively (Fig. 7f). There is no significant difference between the C12H5 and the control antibodies, suggesting these bnAb-like human antibodies response upon the virus infections are relatively medium frequent.The above-mentioned human sera were also used to probe the sensitivity of C12H5 bearing point mutations at critical sites. We found that six of the eight HA mutants (H141A, A142E, G143R, A144E, W153A, D190A) had significantly diminished reactivity to the 5 anti-H1 human sera (6- to 51-fold lower in the half-effective titers; ET50). Of these, five mutations (A142E, G143R, A144E, W153A, D190A) are in critical sites in both H1 and H5 (Fig. 7g). Further, we show that human sera are not sensitive to two mutations (Y98A, A137E); albeit Y98 is part of the common epitope for H1 and H5 (Fig. 7g–i). Together with the aforementioned blocking assay, human antibodies in patients naturally infected with H1 may have a comparative affinity in targeting the broad neutralization epitope like C12H5, FI6 and CH65 epitopes. These results are consistent with the findings in the literature that broad neutralization epitopes seem to have relatively immunodominance in host immunity than strain-specific ones, and should be rationally designed for more immunogenic in broadly protection by means of immune focusing11,12,33. Overall, our selective mutagenesis assays revealed eight key residues for H1 binding (Y98, A137, H141, A142, G143, A144, W153, D190) (Fig. 7h), three critical sites for H5N1 binding (Q142, R144, S145) (Fig. 7i), and tolerance of the D/E residue at position 190 as key determinants for H1 and H5 co-neutralization; of these, six critical sites (H141, A142, G143, A144, W153, D190) are relevant to the human immune response.DiscussionInfluenza viruses continue to be a threat to public health, and may add to the current health burden associated with the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 and other deadly coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, are derived from zoonotic CoVs that have also crossed the species barrier34. This pandemic has better highlighted globally importance of zoonotic virus infection, which can be quite severe due to a lack of preexisting immunity in humans. Zoonotic influenza infections, such as H5N14 and H7N935, have caused several outbreaks over the past two decades. The antigenic evolution of influenza viruses poses a significant challenge for the development of highly effective and long-lasting vaccines or antiviral drugs. Broadly neutralizing antibodies that target conserved epitopes can serve as prophylactic or therapeutic reagents, and guide the design of universal vaccine candidates with broad and long-lasting protection. Such a rationale will undoubtedly be useful for any new emergence.In this work, we performed functional and structural studies using a chimeric antibody, C12H5, that targets the HA receptor-binding sites. We show that C12H5 offers broad-spectrum neutralizing reactivity against seasonal and pandemic H1N1, and offers partial cross-subtype neutralizing reactivity to H5N1 viruses both in vitro and in vivo. We compared its utility with the previously published broadly neutralizing antibodies that target the HA head of the H1 subtype, including CH65, 5J8, and Ab6649, and several antibodies (CR6261, F10, FI6) against both H1N1 and H5N1 strains that offer cross-type neutralization activity via targeting the HA stem region. Among these antibodies, we show the following: CH65 could neutralize seasonal influenza H1N1 viruses before 2009 in the testing virus panel; 5J8 could neutralizes the pandemic H1N1 but not some seasonal H1N1 strains; Ab6649, a broad acting H1 antibody, targets non-RBS conserved epitopes. As compared with these reported antibodies, C12H5 has broad neutralization breadth and an RBS-targeting nature similar to that of 5J8. However, the potency of C12H5 resembles that of CH65 for seasonal H1 strains, and 5J8 shows much higher HAI against the tested pandemic H1N1 strains than C12H5. Moreover, C12H5 uniquely co-recognizes the H5N1 strain to a better extent than do the tested H1 bnAbs 5J8, CH65 or Ab6649.A recent study showed that a naturally occurring bnAb, FluA-20, has a conserved epitope at the interface between two adjacent head domains in the HA trimer, and functions to disrupt the integrity of the HA trimer through a neutralization mechanism25. The epitope is located at the 220-loop and the 90-loop, laterally adjacent to the RBS but not overlapping. Here, we found that the epitope of C12H5 overlaps with the 130-loop of the RBS domain, like 5J8, and at a site that is distant from that of the other H1 antibodies. However, unlike 5J8, the binding region of C12H5 is also uniquely located on the 140-loop outside the RBS pocket in addition to the 130-loop. In contrast, other antibodies recognize only the 130-loop. Despite the high level of variability in the 140-loop, this region may contribute to the cross-subtype reactivity of C12H5 via four key residues that are required for H5 co-recognition, including H/Y141 (90.5% conservation of H in H1, 99.4% of Y in H5) and G143 (99.5% in H1, 98.6% in H5). As such, the 140-loop may be an appealing target for the design of broad acting vaccines.Through the co-crystal structure of 12H5:HAhrCA, we were able to identify the structural basis for the broad H1 neutralization and cross-neutralization to H5 of 12H5, as well as the functional mimicry of receptor binding for virus infection inhibition. First, 12H5 principally interacts with HA, mostly at the 140-loop, through HCDR1, HCDR3, and LCDR1. In the interaction analysis, nine pairs of hydrogen bonds are distributed on the 140-loop of HA, and these bonds account for 60% of all hydrogen bonds in the interaction (9/15). Through mutagenesis analysis, we further showed that the continuous stretch H141-K145 in the epitope is critical for binding. This relatively linear stretch differs to that observed in other cross-subtype antibodies, and this may offer a starting point for antiviral molecule design. Second, 12H5 mimics the receptor-binding mode in a unique manner, forming three hydrogen bonds with the 130-loop via Tyr 32 in LCDR1; this is in stark contrast with the binding of the other receptor-mimicry antibodies, which use Asp and Glu carboxylate at the tip in HCDR2 or HCDR3, not the light chain18,19,20,26,30,36,37 (Supplementary Fig. 15). This novel 12H5 receptor mimicry might offer an alternative solution for engineering a therapeutic antibody. Besides, the antigenic features in the receptor-binding region of HA between H1N1 and H5N1 are distinct due to functions in host recognition. E190D and G225E mutations are generally considered to be evolutionary sites for H1 viruses in their transition from recognizing avian receptors to recognizing human receptors38. Through our mutagenesis analysis, we show position 190 as the crucial site for 12H5 recognition. 12H5 can accept mutations at residue 190 from aspartic acid to glutamic acid structurally by interacting with the main chain of G30cL. Thus, these two amino acids do not collide with 12H5 in spatial conformations. Notably, the G30cL is an insertion in the antibody’s mature affinity process (Supplementary Fig. 1). 12H5 can overcome antigenic variation among H1 and H5 subtypes and bear the mutations as related to receptor-binding transition from human to avian host. Other RBS-directed antibodies are not capable of recognizing this D190E mutation, and lose their neutralization ability. These implications suggest the potential of 12H5 as a structural template for subsequent small-molecule drug designs against human H1N1 and avian H5N1 viruses.The current research on structural vaccinology is aimed at utilizing the conserved epitope of broadly neutralizing antibodies for the design of vaccine candidates that can stimulate a more robust and broader immunity in humans. The 12H5 epitope is highly conserved among most H1N1 and some H5N1 strains. The eight critical sites identified in the mutational and structural analyses are also highly conserved (mean, 90%). It is particularly challenging in this field to design universal vaccines against various subtypes of influenza viruses; indeed, the most advanced and promising methods are guided by the epitope structures identified by broadly nAbs33,39,40. In this study, C12H5 could broadly neutralize H1 and cross-neutralize H5 by engaging with a receptor-binding site that tolerates key site differences between H1 and H5. We suggest consideration of two key points for the design of an improved vaccine candidates. First, when selecting the recommended strains for traditional vaccine development during the influenza season, the antigenic composition of H1N1 strain should be prioritized to select the strain that harbors most of the C12H5 epitope residues; i.e., Y98, A137, H141, A/Q142, G143, A/R144, S145, W153, D/E190. Second, an immunogen designed for a broadly protective influenza vaccine—designed using an immune-focusing approach and based on structural information—could present the appropriate antigenic sites recognized by bnAbs such as C12H5. As suggested, based on its highly conserved and cross-neutralization nature, we sought to establish some clues that C12H5 epitope could be used in vaccine design. The C12H5 epitope features a conformational contour but its amino acid sequence is continuousness at two regions: R1, aa. K133a-V155 and R2, aa. H183-L194 (Supplementary Fig. 16a, b). We synthesized three polypeptides: two R1–R2 fusion peptides joined by a structurally favorable GSG linker, the sequences of which were derived from CA4/2009 and QH/2005 strains; and an R1 peptide of CA4/2009 strain. A fourth irrelevant polypeptide, VZV, served as a control. The polypeptides were then covalently conjugated to lysine residues of keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) (Supplementary Fig. 16c), a widely used particle carrier for enhancing immunogenicity41,42. We then undertook immunization experiments: 10 mice were vaccinated with 25 μg of KLH-conjugated polypeptides at prime-boost immunization regimen delivered at weeks 0, 2, and 4. The sera obtained from immunization with CA-KLH, CA-R1-KLH, and QH-KLH conjugates showed 37% to 60% blocking ratios for C12H5 from binding to CA4/2009 HA (Supplementary Fig. 16d). Moreover, the antisera of QH-KLH exhibited high reactivity against QH/2005 HA (Supplementary Fig. 16e). Although these sera did not show observable neutralization titers in an in vitro neutralization assay (data not shown)—possibly due to a lower neutralizing antibody frequency—immunization with QH-KLH afforded 20% and 40% survival rates to vaccinated mice who were lethally challenged with MA-CA4/2009 and MA-QH/2005 viruses, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 16f–i). Additionally, immunization with CA-KLH or CA-R1-KLH provided 40% survival against lethal challenge with MA-CA4/2009 (Supplementary Fig. 16f). Taken together, these results suggest that the C12H5 epitope is otherwise immunogenic, and we believe that a primary polypeptide constituted by partial C12H5 epitope could serve as a starting model for further rational design of H1/H5 broad vaccine candidates.In conclusion, we elucidated an excellent H1 and H5 cross-neutralizing antibody that can mimic the human and avian receptor-binding modes. This antibody could serve as a template for further structure-guided drug discovery and design. The epitope binding regions may also help to guide the design of cross-subtype or universal influenza vaccines.MethodsViruses and cellsBiodefense and Emerging Infections Resourses Repository (BEI Resources) kindly provided A/Texas/36/1991 (H1N1), A/Beijing/262/1995 (H1N1), A/New Caledonia/20/1999 (H1N1), A/Solomon Is/3/2006 (H1N1), A/Brisbane/59/2007 (H1N1), A/California/04/2009 (H1N1), A/California/07/2009 (H1N1), A/Brisbane/10/2007 (H3N2) and B/Florida/4/2006 (Yamagata) strains. The University of Hong Kong kindly provided A/Hong Kong/134801/1994 (H1N1), A/Shantou/104/2005 (H1N1), A/Hong Kong/MB-1/2010 (H1N1), A/Hong Kong/402618/2011 (H1N1). The recombinant H5N1 viruses were constructed using frame of A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) containing HA and NA genes derived from A/Chicken/HK/YU22/2002 (H5N1), A/Bar-headed Goose/Qinghai/15C/2005 (H5N1), A/Migratory Duck/Jiangxi/2295/2005 (H5N1) or A/Xinjiang/1/2006 (H5N1). The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University and the Xiamen International Travel Healthcare Center provided the A/Xiamen/N514/2009 (H1N1) and A/Xiamen/s27/2015 (H1N1) strains.The mouse-adapted strains—MA-A/California/04/2009 (H1N1, MA-CA4/2009), MA-A/California/07/2009 (H1N1, MA-CA7/2009), MA-A/New Caledonia/20/1999 (H1N1, MA-NC/1999), and MA-A/Bar-headed Goose/Qinghai/15C/2005 (H5N1, MA-QH/2005) —were generated through successive passaging in the lungs of mice. All viruses were grown in MDCK cells using standard viral culturing techniques. Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were maintained in Eagle’s minimal essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% calf serum. Cell lines used in this study were obtained from the ATCC (MDCK) or Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (CHO, 293 T, Sf9 and H5 cells). All cell lines used in this study were routinely tested for mycoplasma and found to be mycoplasma-free.Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs)Seasonal H1N1 virus strains A/Hong Kong/134801/1994 (HK/1994), A/New Caledonia/20/1999 (NC/1999), and A/Brisbane/59/2007 (BR/2007) were chosen as immunogens for mAb production. Preparation of mAbs followed standard hybridoma technology, as previously described22. Briefly, 6-week-old female BALB/c mice were injected subcutaneously with formalin-inactivated HK/1994 and then, at twice weekly intervals, with successive equivalent doses of virus NC/1999. Fusion was performed two weeks after the final immunization with virus BR/2007. The resulting hybridomas were screened for the secretion of NC/1999-specific mAbs using a hemagglutination inhibition assay. We further screened for antibody cross-reactivity to other HA subtypes using a hemagglutination inhibition assay. The hybridoma cells were cloned using a limiting dilution at least three times, and positive clones were expanded and cultured in 75-cm2 flasks. MAbs were prepared by injecting hybridoma cells into the peritoneal cavities of pristine-primed BALB/c mice; ascites were collected after 9–12 days and stored at −20 °C. One mAb, 12H5, neutralized the tested viruses in all of the assays. The hybridoma producing mAb 12H5 was cloned three times via limiting dilution, and 12H5 mAb was then purified from mouse ascites using protein A agarose columns (GE Healthcare).Sequencing analysisInfluenza RNA was extracted from samples using a QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen), following the manufacturer’s instructions. The extracted viral RNA was subjected to one-step RT-PCR (QIAGEN OneStep RT-PCR Kit) with influenza A HA primer sets. The PCR products were separated on a 1.5% agarose gel with a 100-bp DNA ladder and visualized using a UV transilluminator. The PCR products were gel purified using a Universal DNA Purification Kit (TianGen) and sequenced. Sequencing of the variable gene regions of the 12H5 antibody was performed. Briefly, total RNA was extracted from 107 hybridoma cells using a MiniBEST Universal RNA Extraction Kit (TaKaRa Bio Inc.). The extracted RNA was subjected to a reverse transcription reaction with the following primers: 5’-GGGAATTCATGRAGWCACAKWCYCAGGTCTTT-3’ (L-chain-forward) 5’-CCCAAGCTTACTGGATGGTGGGAAGATGGA-3’ (L-chain-reverse) for reverse transcription of the light chain variable region gene and 5’-GGGAATTCATGRASTTSKGGYTMARCTKGRTTT-3’ (H-chain-forward) 5’-CCCAAGCTTACGAGGGGGAAGACATTTGGGAA-3’ (H-chain-reverse) for reverse transcription of the heavy chain variable region gene.Construction of chimeric antibodiesChimeric versions of 12H5 (C12H5), six previously reported influenza A HA antibodies (5J8, CH65, Ab6649, CR6261, FI6, and F10 antibodies), and a control antibody (C12G6) containing a human Fc fragment were constructed as described previously23. The variable gene for each antibody was inserted into a pTT5 vector containing the constant region of the human IgG1 gamma heavy chain or kappa light chain. Recombinant antibodies were expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells through transient transfection and purified from the culture media by MAbselect Sure (GE Healthcare) affinity chromatography.Hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assayHemagglutination inhibition was performed under the World Health Organization Manual on Animal Influenza Diagnosis and Surveillance, modified as previously described43,44. Briefly, viruses were diluted to 8 HA units and combined with an equal volume of serially diluted mAbs and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. An equal volume of 0.5% Turkey red blood cells was added to the wells, and the incubation continued on a gentle rocking plate for 30 min. Button formation was scored as evidence of hemagglutination.Microneutralization assaysCell-based microneutralization assays were performed as previously described45. Briefly, two-fold dilutions of mAbs were mixed with 100 TCID50 of viruses and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The mixture was added into a 96-well plate of confluent monolayers of MDCK cells. After 1 h adsorption, the virus inoculums were removed, and the cells were cultured with MEM containing trypsin (2 mg/mL). HA tests of the supernatant were scored as evidence of neutralization. For the HA test, 50 μL of 0.5% turkey red blood cells (TRBCs) was added to 50 μL of cell culture supernatant, and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The neutralization titers was determined as the lowest mAb concentration negative for hemagglutination. The assay was performed in quadruplicate.Direct and Sandwich ELISA96-well plates were coated overnight at 4 °C with 2 μg/mL purified HAs (100 μL per well). The plates were washed three times with PBS containing 0.1% v/v Tween-20 (PBST) and blocked with 1× enzyme dilution buffer (PBS + 0.25% casein + 1% gelatin + 0.05% proclin-300) for 2 h at 37 °C. The plates were then washed with PBST. Wells were then incubated with serial 2-fold dilutions of purified antibody for 30 min at 37 °C. After three washes, 100 μL of horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-human IgG antibody (Abcam, 1:5000 dilution) solution was added to each well and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. After five washes, 100 μL of tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate (WANTAI BioPharm) was added at room temperature in the dark. The reaction was stopped after 15 min with 2 M H2SO4 solution, and the absorbance was measured at 450 nm wavelength. All samples were run in triplicate. The EC50 values were calculated with Prism software (GraphPad) using a non-linear regression analysis.The binding profiles of HA and its mutants against MAb C12H5 were evaluated by double-antibody sandwich ELISA. The wells of a 96-well plate were coated with 200 ng of anti-His antibody (Proteintech, 1:5000 dilution) prepared in PBS, pH 7.4, and incubated overnight at 4 °C. HA proteins in half-serially diluted concentrations (starting from 5 μg/mL; diluted in PBS) were added to each well and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. This was followed by the addition of horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated MAb C12H5 and a further 30-min incubation. The color was developed using TMB substrate, as described above. EC50 values were calculated at the half-point of the curve by polynomial fitting. K D determinationKD values were determined by SPR technology using a Biacore3000 instrument (GE Healthcare), as described previously26. The anti-human IgG Fc antibody (GE Healthcare) was amine-coupled to a CM-5 sensor chip for use. MAb C12H5 was then captured on the sensor surface at a 30 μL/min flow rate in HBS buffer (10 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, and 0.005% Tween-20, pH 7.4). The kinetics of C12H5 binding with HA and its mutants were measured at 30 μL/min flow rate in HBS buffer, delivered at 2-fold serially diluted concentrations (160, 80, 40, 20, and 10 nM). The flow durations were 200 s for the association stage and 10 min for dissociation. Association rates (ka), dissociation rates (kd), and affinity constants (KD) were calculated using BIAcore evaluation software. All experiments were repeated twice. The mean ka, kd, and KD values are reported.Immunofluorescent stainingMonolayers of MDCK cells in 24-well plates were infected with HK/1994 (H1N1), A/California/04/2009 (H1N1, CA4/2009) or QH/2005 (H5N1) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.2 for 16 h at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2. Virus-infected cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min in the dark, treated with 0.3% Triton X-100 diluted in PBS for 10 min, and then blocked for 1 h at 37 °C with 4% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS. Cells were then incubated with C12H5, 5J8, or control antibody C12G6 for 1 h at 37 °C. After three rinses with PBS, the cells were sequentially stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-human IgG antibody (KPL, 1: 5000 dilution) for 30 min and 4, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for 5 min. Cells were then visualized using a fluorescence microscope using a Zeiss LSM 780 confocal microscope with the ZEN software (version 2.3).Prophylactic and the therapeutic efficacy studies in miceIn a prophylactic study, a group of 5 female BALB/c mice, aged 6–8 weeks, each received 10, 5, 2.5, or 1 mg/kg of C12H5 or 10 mg/kg of control IgG C12G6 (200 µL) one day before being intranasally challenged with 25 times the 50% mouse lethal dose (MLD50) of MA-CA4/ 2009 (H1N1), MA-NC/1999 (H1N1) and MA-QH/2005 (H5N1) viruses delivered in a 50 μL volume. In therapeutic studies, C12H5 Mab, at a dose of 20, 10, 5 or 1 mg/kg, or 20 mg/kg of control IgG C12G6 was intravenously injected through the tail vein at 24 h after virus infection. Animals were observed daily for mortality and morbidity. Body weight was measured for up to 14 days after infection.For a therapeutic comparison of the antibodies, C12H5 was injected at one of two doses 24 h after virus infection: 15 mg/kg or 3 mg/kg C12H5 to treat MA-CA4/2009 (H1N1), and 15 mg/kg C12H5 to treat MA-QH/2005 (H5N1). The Humane Endpoints guidelines were strictly followed for all in vivo experiments. Animals that lost more than 25% of their initial body weight were immediately euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation and were recorded as nonsurvivors. The lungs of mice were collected for virus titration at 6 days after infection. 12H5 against H1N1 and H5N1 virus infection in a mouse model. For mouse antibody 12H5, female mice (n = 5) were challenged with lethal doses of MA-CA7/2009 (H1N1), and MA-QH/2005(H5N1)—and then treated with different doses (10 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg, or 2.5 mg/kg) of 12H5 or PBS (placebo) at 24 h after infection. Animals were observed daily for mortality, and body weight was measured for up to 14 days after infection.Selection of escape mutantsSeasonal H1N1 virus strains HK/1994, NC/1999, BR/2007, and CA7/2009 were selected to identify escape mutants. Escape mutants were selected by culturing the above virus strains in MDCK cells in the presence of MAb C12H5. Viruses were incubated with purified MAb C12H5 (final concentration of 10 mg/mL) for 1 h, with mixtures inoculated into confluent MDCK cells growing in 6-well tissue culture plates. After 1 h adsorption, the cells were overlaid with MEM containing 1% Bacto-Agar (Difco) and MAb C12H5 (final concentration of 50 μg/mL) and trypsin (2 mg/mL) and then incubated for 2 days at 37 °C. Escape mutants were purified from single isolated plaques and propagated in MDCK cells with serum-free MEM containing trypsin. The nucleotide sequences of the HA genes of the parent strains and the escape mutants were determined, and deduced amino acid sequences were compared among the viruses.Cloning, expression, and purification of the hemagglutininsThe genes encoding for the ectodomains of HA proteins (aa 11-329 of HA1 and 1-174 of HA2, H3 numbering) from the CA4/2009 (H1N1), NC/1999 (H1N1), A/Beijing/262/1995 (H1N1, BJ/1999), A/Washington/05/2011 (H1N1, WA/2011) and QH/2005 (H5N1) were cloned into the baculovirus transfer vector (pAcGP67B) (BD Biosciences) for baculovirus preparation. The construct contains an N-terminal gp67 secretion signal peptide and a C-terminal thrombin, trimerization Foldon sequence, and 6-His-tag for purification, as previously described26. For the expression of recombinant HA proteins, H5 suspension cells (Invitrogen) were infected with recombinant baculovirus at 5–8 MOI at 28 °C for 72 h. The supernatant was then dialyzed against PBS, pH 7.4, and purified with Ni-NTA resin (GE Healthcare) with 250 mM imidazole elution. For immune complex preparation, purified BJ/1995 HA was treated with thrombin to remove the foldon before trypsin digestion, as previously described26. CA4/2009 HA was prepared without protease treatment to maintain the trimer formation.Purification, crystallization, and structure determinationThe 12H5 Fab was prepared by papain digestion of mAb 12H5 and purified with DEAE-5PW (TOSOH Biosciences), as described previously46. HA was mixed with 12H5 Fab in a molar ratio of 1:1.2 (HA protomer to Fab) and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The immune complex was further purified to remove excess Fab by gel filtration on a Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) in 10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, with 50 mM NaCl. The complex was concentrated to ~7.5 mg/mL for crystallization. Crystallization was performed using sitting-drop vapor diffusion in the screening stage and hanging drop in microseeding optimization at 20 °C. Crystals of the complex were grown in 0.1 M MES, pH 6.5, with 13% (w/v) PEG 2000. The crystal growth of the immune complex took about 2 months for final data collection. Crystals were cryo-protected in reservoir solution supplemented with 30% glycerol at 100 K before collecting the diffraction data. Diffraction data were collected at the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF) beamline BL17U using a Quantum-315r CCD Area Detector. Datasets were processed using the HKL-2000 program package (http://www.hkl-xray.com). The unit cell of 12H5:HAhrCA crystal can only accommodate one HA head region and one 12H5 Fab in its asymmetric unit. During molecular replacement phasing in Phenix47, we found that the ensemble comprised one HA head region and one Fab molecule, and we could not trace the rest of the HA monomer during model building in Coot48. We surmise that the long-term crystallization process of ~2 months may have led to the degradation of the HA trimer, as also observed in our previous study26. We used sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) to show HA degradation. We characterized the crystallization sample of the 12H5:HACA complex before crystallization and at 2 months after storage (Supplementary Fig. 7e). We identified a band in the SDS-PAGE at a molecular weight of ~70 kD (corresponding to one Fab 47kD + one HA head region 23 kD, spanning aa 56–263 of HA1 in the final model) in the asymmetric unit. We used this permutated complex of partial HA and one Fab for phase searching with molecular replacement (MR), implemented with PHASER49 suite using PHENIX47 to refine the initial phases. The search models for the HA head region and 12H5 Fab were PDB code: 3lzg and 1c1e, respectively. The resulting models were manually built in Coot, refined with PHENIX and analyzed with MolProbity50. In brief, one round of rigid-body refinement was performed after MR. The refined models were manually modified in Coot; coordinates and individual B factors were refined in reciprocal space. TLS refinement was performed in the later stages with auto-searched TLS groups in PHENIX, which are listed in REMARK 3 sections in the deposited PDB files. Data collection and structure refinement statistics are summarized in Supplementary Table 3.Cryo-EM and 3D reconstructionThe 12H5: HA complexes were prepared as described above. The cryo-EM and 3D reconstruction were performed as per our published studies51. In brief, an aliquot (3-μL) of complex sample was deposited onto a glow-discharged Quantifoil holey carbon grid (R2/1, 200 mesh; Quantifoil Micro Tools). After 6 s of blotting to remove the excess sample, the grid was plunge-frozen into liquid ethane using a Thermo Fisher Vitrobot, and then examined under low-dose conditions at 300 kV with an Thermo Fisher F30 transmission electron microscope. Images were recorded on a Gatan K3 direct electron detector (36-frame movie mode) at a nominal magnification of 39,000 at supre-resolution mode corresponding to a pixel size of 0.389 Å. A total electron dose of ~60 e–/Å2 was used, with an exposure time of 4.5 s. SerialEM52 automated data collection software was used for all data acquisition.Motion correction, CTF estimation, particle picking and extraction were performed with CyroSPARC V353. Micrographs with excessive drift or astigmatism were discarded. Two rounds of reference-free 2D classification, initial model and final 3D density map reconstruction was all performed with CyroSPARC V3. The final map resolution was determined based on “gold-standard” criteria of the Fourier Shell Correlation (FSC) curve with a cut-off at 0.14354. Local map resolution was estimated with ResMap55.Atomic model building, refinement, and 3D visualizationThe crystal of 12H5: HAhrCA and CA trimer (PDB code: 3LZG) were used to generate an initial model by homology modeling unsing Accelrys Discovery Studio software (available from: URL: https://www.3dsbiovia.com). We initially fitted the initial model into the corresponding final cryo-EM map using Chimera56, and further corrected and adjusted them manually by real-space refinement in Coot48. The resulting models were then refined with phenix.real_space_refine in PHENIX47. These operations were executed iteratively until the problematic regions, Ramachandran outliers, and poor rotamers were either eliminated or moved to favored regions. The final atomic models were validated with Molprobity50. All cryo-EM relative figures were generated with Chimera or ChimeraX57.Sequence analysis and epitope conservationA total of 8907 and 2263 full-length, non-redundant H1N1 and H5N1 HA sequences, respectively, were downloaded from the NCBI FLU database on 3rd May 2021. After multiple sequence alignment, a residue was considered conserved only if it was identical at the equivalent site among most sequences. All sequences were aligned and analyzed by Clustal Omega. The values reported for percent conservation are the number of sequences with an identical change at a position divided by the total number of sequences. The conservation figure indicating the sequence conservation was generated using PyMoL Molecular Graphics System.Gel filtration chromatographyTSK Gel PW5000xl 7.8×300-mm columns (TOSOH Corporation) were equilibrated in PBS using the Waters HPLC system. Samples of HA, Fab and the immune complexes were dialyzed against PBS and diluted to 1 mg/mL before loading. The flow rate was maintained at 0.5 mL/min and the absorbance at 280 nm was recorded.Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)Protein samples were mixed with loading buffer (50 mM Tris pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.01% bromophenol blue, 8% glycerol), boiled for 10 min, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Equal amounts of protein for each sample were loaded onto SDS-PAGE gels. The proteins were electrophoresed for 70 min at 120 V in a BioRad MINI-PROTEAN Tetra system (BioRad Laboratories), and the gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (Bio-Rad) for 30 min at room temperature.Cell-based entry inhibition assayThe cell-based entry inhibition assay was performed as described previously23. Briefly, viruses were incubated for 1 h with 10 μg/mL C12H5 or polyclonal rabbit serum diluted in PBS raised against purified NC/1999, HK/1994, CA4/2009, A/XM/N514/2009 (H1N1, XM/2009), A/Hong Kong/MB-1/2010 (H1N1, HK/2010), QH/2005 or A/Xinjiang/1/2006 (H5N1, XJ/2006) viruses. The mixture was added to MDCK cell monolayers in 96-well format in infection medium (DMEM supplemented with 2 μg/mL acetylated trypsin). The inoculum was subsequently removed and replaced with antibody or polyclonal rabbit serum at the indicated concentrations, and cultured for 16–18 h at 37 °C in 10% CO2. Supernatants were then removed, and the cells were fixed in 80% acetone and stained sequentially with a mouse monoclonal anti-NP primary antibody and Alexa Fluor 488-coupled anti-mouse secondary antibody (Invitrogen, 1:5000 dilution). Cellular nuclei were then labeled with DAPI, and the plates were analyzed using an Opera Phenix High-Content Screening System (PerkinElmer).Egress inhibition assayEgress inhibition assay was carried out as described previously25. Briefly, monolayers of MDCK cells were seeded into 96-well plates in DMEM supplemented with 10% calf serum for 12 h at 37 °C. The cells were replenished with infection medium (DMEM supplemented with 2 μg/mL acetylated trypsin) and infected with viruses at an MOI of 2 for NC/1999, HK/1994, CA4/2009, XM/2009, HK/2010, QH/2005 or XJ/2006 viruses for 4 h at 37 °C in 10% CO2. The supernatants were then removed and the cells were washed three times with PBS to remove non-internalized virus particles. The cells were replenished with an infection medium containing serial dilutions of C12H5 or a control antibody. After 18 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2, the supernatants were collected and clarified at 300 ×g for 15 min to remove the cell debris. Serial 2-fold dilutions of supernatants in PBS were added to an equal volume of 0.5% turkey red blood cells for 30 min to determine the virus titres by Hemagglutination assay. Button formation was scored as evidence of hemagglutination.Polypeptide-carrier protein conjugate preparationThe C12H5 epitope features a conformational contour but its amino acid sequence is continuousness at two regions: R1, aa. K133a-V155 and R2, aa. H183-L194 We synthesized three polypeptides: two R1–R2 fusion peptides joined by a structurally favorable GSG linker, the sequences of which were derived from CA4/2009 and QH/2005 strains; and an R1 peptide of CA4/2009 strain. A fourth irrelevant polypeptide, VZV, served as a control. The polypeptides were then covalently conjugated to lysine residues of keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) To prepare polypeptide-carrier protein conjugates, all the polypeptide were conjugated to a lysine residue on the carrier protein keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) using m-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (MBS), following the manufacturer’s protocol.Immunization assaySix groups of BALB/c mice (n = 10 per group) around 7–8 weeks old were immunized in 2-week intervals with KLH-conjugated C12H5 epitope peptides, which were formulated with Freund’s adjuvant (Sigma-Aldrich). A dosage of 25 μg peptides per 200 μL was administered by intraperitoneal (IP) route for all these animals. Sera samples were collected before each injection and stored for ELISA and other analyses. At week 5, every one group was divided into two subgroups (n = 5 per group) randomly, and each subgroup was then intranasally challenged with 25 times amount of the 50% mouse lethal dose (MLD50) of MA-CA4/2009 (H1N1) or MA-QH/2005 (H5N1) viruses, which were prepared in a 50 μL volume. The mice were observed daily for mortality and morbidity, and body weight of survival animals was measured for up to 14 days after infection, as described above.Blocking ELISAThe reactivities of human or mice sera against the C12H5 epitope were measured by a blocking ELISA. Five serum samples were taken from H1N1-infected persons who were H1N1-RNA positive; we were unable to obtain H5N1 human sera. Sera were pre-incubated with H1 HA before addition of the antibody. The sera harvested from the mice immunized with C12H5 epitope peptides were measured by the blocking ELISA assay as well. In brief, the concentration of the blocked enzyme-labeled antibody (C12H5-HRP, FI6-HRP or CH65-HRP) was first modulated to have an OD value between 0.8 and 1.2 without any blocking. Then, the human or mice sera (at 1:50 dilution) were coated to the wells with purified CA4/2009 or NC/1999 HA in blocking solution (final volume: 100 μL per well), and the microplates were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. HRP-conjugated antibody was then added and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Wells were washed twice and the reaction was catalyzed with o-phenylenediamine substrate at 37 °C for 10 min. The OD value was converted to percentage inhibition using the following formula: PI (%) = 100 − [(ODsample/ODcontrol) × 100]%, where the OD values of control wells were measured for the wells containing only HRP-conjugated antibody.Ethic statementAll infectious materials were handled in a BSL-2 facility under approved protocols according to Xiamen University guidelines.

The researchers designed a single, universal influenza vaccine candidate with key cross-protective, less variable parts of the influenza A and B viruses: multi-neuraminidase protein subtypes known to be major antiviral drug targets and the universally conserved M2 ectodomain protein. The findings, published in the journal PLOS Pathogens, report that mice vaccinated with an immune stimulating virus-like particle displaying multiple neuraminidase subtypes and conserved M2 portions of antigens (foreign proteins that induce immune responses) were protected against influenza A seasonal variants and pandemic potential viruses (H1N1, H5N1, H3N2, H9N2 and H7N9) and influenza B (Yamagata and Victoria lineage) viruses containing substantial antigenic variations. Viral variants occur when flu pathogens change their major surface hemagglutinin protein that binds to host receptor molecules. Continuous mutational changes in the flu hemagglutinin proteins cause the emergence of variants that have escaped the host immune system, leading to severe flu disease. Current influenza vaccines are based on strain-specific immunity to hemagglutinin, a highly variable target of immune protection. Annual influenza vaccination is recommended, but the effectiveness of the seasonal vaccine is unpredictable and could be below 20 percent because of continuous changes in hemagglutinin proteins. Therefore, influenza remains a high risk to human health worldwide. “We developed a single, universal vaccine entity that induced immunity to conserved M2 ectodomain and multi subtype neuraminidase proteins and was found to be effective in conferring broad cross protection against antigenically diverse influenza A and B viruses in young and aged mice,” said Dr. Sang-Moo Kang, senior author of the study and a professor in the Institute for Biomedical Sciences at Georgia State. “This study provides impactful insight into developing a universal influenza vaccine inducing broad immunity against both flu A and B variants in young and aged populations.” This study supports a novel strategy for creating a universal vaccine against influenza A and B viruses. A single construct displaying multiple cross protective proteins has the capacity to induce immunity to M2 and multi-subtype neuraminidase proteins of influenza A and B viruses, as well as offer broad cross protection against sickness and mortality under lethal flu virus challenges in mice, according to the study. Vaccinating mice with this universal vaccine candidate induced broad neuraminidase inhibition, M2 ectodomain specific antibodies and T cell immune responses. Comparable cross protection was induced in aged mice. The study warrants further testing of this unique, universal vaccine candidate in ferrets, which have similar respiratory tracts to humans.

The study found that that mice vaccinated with an immune stimulating virus-like particle displaying multiple neuraminidase subtypes and conserved M2 portions of antigens (foreign proteins that induce immune responses) were protected against influenza A seasonal variants and pandemic potential viruses (H1N1, H5N1, H3N2, H9N2 and H7N9) and influenza B (Yamagata and Victoria lineage) viruses containing substantial antigenic variations. Viral variants occur when flu pathogens change their major surface hemagglutinin protein that binds to host receptor molecules. Continuous mutational changes in the flu hemagglutinin proteins cause the emergence of variants that have escaped the host immune system, leading to severe flu disease. Current influenza vaccines are based on strain-specific immunity to hemagglutinin, a highly variable target of immune protection. Annual influenza vaccination is recommended, but the effectiveness of the seasonal vaccine is unpredictable and could be below 20 percent because of continuous changes in hemagglutinin proteins. Therefore, influenza remains a high risk to human health worldwide. “We developed a single, universal vaccine entity that induced immunity to conserved M2 ectodomain and multi subtype neuraminidase proteins and was found to be effective in conferring broad cross protection against antigenically diverse influenza A and B viruses in young and aged mice,” said Dr Sang-Moo Kang, senior author of the study. “This study provides impactful insight into developing a universal influenza vaccine inducing broad immunity against both flu A and B variants in young and aged populations.” This study supports a novel strategy for creating a universal vaccine against influenza A and B viruses. A single construct displaying multiple cross protective proteins has the capacity to induce immunity to M2 and multi-subtype neuraminidase proteins of influenza A and B viruses, as well as offer broad cross protection against sickness and mortality under lethal flu virus challenges in mice, according to the study. Vaccinating mice with this universal vaccine candidate induced broad neuraminidase inhibition, M2 ectodomain specific antibodies and T cell immune responses. Comparable cross protection was induced in aged mice. The study permits further testing of this unique, universal flu vaccine candidate in ferrets, which have similar respiratory tracts to humans.

A lower-dose, freeze-dried, pandemic influenza vaccine candidate will use Arcturus’ STARR™ self-amplifying mRNA vaccine platform technology which demonstrated favorable safety and efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 infection combined with a stable cold chain profile that may help support U.S. government pandemic preparedness goals. During the early stages of a pandemic influenza outbreak, rapidly developing and distributing vaccines is essential to curbing the spread of disease and helping to save lives. As part of ongoing efforts to bolster pandemic preparedness, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) is partnering with Arcturus Therapeutics Holdings, Inc. to develop a self-amplifying messenger RNA (samRNA) vaccine against pandemic influenza based on the company’s platform technology and using modern production practices to ensure rapid production. The award to Arcturus is for an initial three years to support preclinical, manufacturing, nonclinical safety studies, along with development and regulatory support for Arcturus’ self-amplifying mRNA vaccine platform technology for rapid pandemic influenza response through Phase 1 clinical studies. “We are very pleased to have won this substantial award from the BARDA and look forward to working with the U.S. government to support the development of our proprietary self-amplifying mRNA vaccine technology for rapid pandemic influenza response. Arcturus’ next generation mRNA platform has been administered to over 10,000 individuals globally demonstrating favorable safety, strong immunogenicity, and protection against SARS-COV-2 infection,” said Joseph Payne, President and CEO of Arcturus Therapeutics. “Our lyophilized vaccines have the potential to provide safe and effective protection against disease with the specific advantage of rapid scale-up, lower doses, and easier transport and storage. These are qualities that are essential to a rapid response against pandemic influenza and are consistent with strategic objectives of the U.S. government’s National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza.” Supporting Pandemic Influenza Countermeasure Capacity Building Beginning in 2005, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services—guided by the National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza (2005), the National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza Implementation Plan (2006), and the Department of Health and Human Services’ Pandemic Influenza Plan (2017)—began to develop sufficient domestic manufacturing surge capacity to provide pandemic influenza vaccine for the entire country and established a pre-pandemic influenza vaccine stockpile to expedite vaccination of the critical workforce. Additionally, in alignment with the second goal in BARDA’s 2022-2026 Strategic Plan, this program aims to enhance our response posture by leveraging a diverse portfolio of proven medical countermeasure technologies while continuing to identify opportunities for product development to address gaps in preparedness. To achieve these strategic goals and to provide more vaccines sooner, BARDA is supporting the development of additional production platform technologies and adjuvants for the manufacturing of seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccines. This contract with Arcturus supports the non-clinical efficacy studies and pre-clinical development, early-stage clinical development, drug product manufacturing, and all associated regulatory and quality assurance activities for a samRNA-based pandemic influenza vaccine to enhance U.S. and global pandemic preparedness. Arcturus’ vaccine candidate uses samRNA. samRNA is designed to make many copies of the viral protein within the cell, thereby enabling lower doses than conventional mRNA vaccines. Utilizing nucleic acid and recombinant-based technologies – which include mRNA-based platforms – for seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccine development offers further options for meeting domestic vaccine manufacturing surge capacity goals. These technologies may make vaccines available much sooner than egg- and cell-based technologies. Arcturus has used the samRNA platform technology in their leading lyophilized COVID-19 vaccine candidate, ARCT-154, which is currently in late-stage clinical trials. The lyophilized vaccine formulation is stable in standard refrigerators, thereby simplifying cold-chain storage and reducing distribution risks. This project has been supported in whole or in part with federal funds from the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response; Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), under Contract Number: 75A50122C00007.

The late breaking research is presented in a Hot Line session at ESC Congress 2022.1 Senior author and chief investigator Professor Tor Biering-Sørensen of the Centre for Translational Cardiology and Pragmatic Randomized Trials, University of Copenhagen, Denmark said: “The reductions in hospitalizations and all-cause mortality with the high-dose vaccine were encouraging but require confirmation in a larger trial before potentially guiding clinical practice.” Previous studies have investigated the association between influenza infection and cardiovascular events. One study found a six-fold increased risk of myocardial infarction in the week following a positive influenza test,2 while another found that approximately 19% of heart failure hospitalizations could be attributed to influenza in months with high influenza activity.3 A study of adults hospitalized with influenza found that almost 12% had an acute cardiovascular event.4 Observational5 and randomised6 studies indicate that influenza vaccination can prevent cardiovascular events. High-dose vaccines contain 60 μg of haemagglutinin antigen for each strain, while standard-dose vaccines contain only 15 μg. Professor Biering-Sørensen said: “High-dose vaccines are approved for adults aged 65 years and older in most countries, and for those 60 years and older in some countries. However, only a few countries offer older adults a high-dose vaccine by default. Thus, high-dose vaccines are not widely implemented despite accumulating evidence of additional protection against influenza infection and influenza-related morbidity compared with standard-dose vaccines.”7-9 No individually randomized trial has assessed the effects of high-dose, compared with standard-dose, quadrivalent influenza vaccines on severe clinical outcomes such as hospitalizations and mortality in a general population of older adults. This would enable a full assessment of the potential public health value of high-dose vaccines. Due to the large sample size required, such a trial would need to incorporate innovative, pragmatic elements and DANFLU-1 was therefore conducted as a feasibility trial to test the design. The study integrated a pragmatic randomized trial into the official Danish vaccination program by partnering with a private vaccination provider. The study was organized with a central trial site located at a public university hospital and more than 1,000 vaccination sessions across Denmark organized by the private vaccination provider. The open-label study randomized participants 1:1 to either high-dose or standard-dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine. Older adults aged 65 to 79 years were enrolled, randomized, and vaccinated during the sessions. Participant data were then transferred to the central trial site and linked to nationwide Danish administrative health registries from which all other data (baseline, outcome, safety) were obtained. Professor Biering-Sørensen said: “The trial only required one study visit with almost all information obtained from administrative health registries. This greatly reduced the burden on both participants and investigators.” The primary objective was to evaluate the feasibility of the design such as the number of participants included and randomized to each vaccine, agreement between randomization assignment and actual received vaccine, the balance between groups in terms of number of subjects in each arm and baseline characteristics, and a comparison of baseline characteristics with the overall Danish general population aged 65 to 79 years. The second objective was to estimate the relative vaccine effectiveness of the high-dose compared with the standard-dose for a range of cardiovascular and respiratory endpoints. A total of 12,477 participants were included in the final analyses: 6,245 randomized to high-dose vaccine and 6,232 randomized to standard-dose vaccine. The average age was 71.7 years and 5,877 (47.1%) were women. Registry-based data collection was feasible with complete follow-up information for 99.97% of participants. Baseline characteristics were comparable to the overall Danish population aged 65 to 79 years. For example, 20.4% of trial participants had chronic cardiovascular disease compared with 22.9% of the national population. High-dose recipients had a lower incidence of hospitalization for influenza or pneumonia compared with standard-dose recipients, with 10 (0.2%) versus 28 (0.4%) events, respectively, and a relative vaccine effectiveness of 64.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] 24.4% to 84.6%). High-dose recipients also had a lower incidence of all-cause mortality, with 21 (0.3%) versus 41 (0.7%) events, respectively, and a relative vaccine effectiveness of 48.9% (95% CI 11.5% to 71.3%). There were no significant differences in serious adverse events between the high-dose and standard-dose groups. Professor Biering-Sørensen said: “Conducting an innovative pragmatic randomised trial in Denmark using administrative health registries as the primary data source was feasible. Integrating an influenza vaccine trial into the official Danish vaccination programe was also feasible. The next step is to conduct a fully powered trial of high-dose versus standard-dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine in older adults. The required sample size is expected to be around 200,000 participants.” For more information: www.escardio.org Find more content from ESC22 References and Notes 1DANFLU-1 will be discussed during: Hot Line Session 2 on Saturday 27 August at 08:30 to 10:00 CEST in the Barcelona auditorium.

In this study, we found that BinCARD1, an isoform of Bcl10-interacting protein with CARD (BinCARD), was leveraged by IAV for efficient viral replication. BinCARD1 promoted the nuclear import of the vRNP complex and newly synthesized NP and thus enhanced vRNP complex activity. Moreover, we found that BinCARD1 interacted with NP to promote NP binding to importin α7, an adaptor in the host nuclear import pathway. However, we also found that BinCARD1 promoted RIG-I-mediated innate immune signaling by mediating Lys63-linked polyubiquitination of TRAF3, and that TBK1 appeared to degrade BinCARD1. We showed that BinCARD1 was polyubiquitinated at residue K103 through a Lys63 linkage, which was recognized by the TBK1-p62 axis for autophagic degradation. Overall, our data demonstrate that IAV leverages BinCARD1 as an important host factor that promotes viral replication, and two mechanisms in the host defense system are triggered—innate immune signaling and autophagic degradation—to mitigate the promoting effect of BinCARD1 on the life cycle of IAV.

The genome of IAV consists of eight single-stranded negative-sense RNA segments. Each viral RNA (vRNA) segment terminus associates with an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase composed of three polymerase proteins [polymerase basic protein 1 (PB1), polymerase basic protein 2 (PB2), and polymerase acidic protein (PA)], with the remainder of the segment wrapping around the nucleoprotein (NP) strands [1,2,3], forming the vRNP complex.The vRNP complex plays a central role in the life cycle of IAV by catalyzing the transcription and replication of the viral genome [4, 5] in the nucleus of infected cells [6]. Because it is large, the vRNP complex is unable to enter the nucleus through passive diffusion. Upon release from uncoated invading virions, the vRNP complex is imported into the nucleus via the classical nuclear import pathway, a translocation process similar to that of many nuclear proteins. In this pathway, the vRNP complex relies on NP for nuclear import, which is largely dependent on the binding between the nuclear localization signals (NLSs) in NP and isoforms of importin α (IMP α) and the binding between IMP α and importin β1 (IMP β1) [6,7,8,9,10,11]. Two NLSs have been identified in NP: an unconventional NLS in the N-terminus (NLS1; residues 3 to 13) [12, 13] and a bipartite NLS (NLS2; residues 198 to 216) [14]. NLS1 plays a major role in the nuclear import of vRNPs, although it binds weakly to the NLS-binding domain of IMP α [15]. NP interacts with various isoforms of IMP α, including IMP α-1, -3, -5, and -7 [16, 17]. After the recognition of the NLSs in NP by IMP α family members, IMP β1 is recruited to form a trimer that enters the nucleus mediated by nucleoporins [18, 19]. In addition to the central role played by the IMP α/β complex in the nuclear transport of the vRNP complex, several host factors have been shown to participate in the regulation of the nuclear import of the vRNP complex and/or newly synthesized NP, such as PLSCR1, MOV10, HAX1, eEF1D, and Hsp40/DnaJB1 [17, 20,21,22,23]. However, given the importance of the vRNP complex in the IAV life cycle, additional, as-yet undiscovered novel host factors must be involved in vRNP nuclear import.The host factors that facilitate IAV replication can encounter resistance from the host defense system. The innate immune system is the first line of host defense against viral infection. The retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) innate immune signaling pathway plays an important antiviral role to hinder IAV infection. In the cytoplasm, RIG-I senses the 5’ppp-dsRNA panhandle structure that is formed at the ends of viral RNA. Upon binding of the CTD domain to viral RNA [24], RIG-I undergoes conformational changes and oligomerization, exposing the CARD domains to recruit a signaling adaptor called mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS). Acting as the docking site, MAVS recruits the downstream TNF receptor associated factor 3 (TRAF3), tank binding kinase 1 (TBK1), and inhibitor of kappa B kinase ε (IKKε), resulting in the activation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) [25,26,27]. Activated IRF3 is then translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and associates with interferon-stimulated response elements (ISREs) in the promoter of interferon-beta (IFN-β) and interferon-alpha (IFN-α), leading to the production of type I IFNs [24, 28,29,30,31]. TBK1 not only plays an important role in the type I IFN production pathway but also phosphorylates and activates autophagy receptors such as p62/SQSTM1 and OPTN, thereby promoting autophagy [31,32,33,34,35,36].As a member of the caspase recruitment domain family, Bcl10-interacting protein with CARD (BinCARD) is mainly expressed as two isoforms, BinCARD1 and BinCARD2 [37]. The N-terminal structures of both isoforms are essentially identical, with both including a CARD domain; the C-terminus of BinCARD2 also includes a transmembrane domain, which is required for its localization to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria [37]. Functionally, BinCARD2 positively regulates the RIG-I innate immune response by interacting with and promoting the oligomerization of MAVS, and BinCARD1 inhibits the NFκB pathway by inhibiting the phosphorylation of Bcl10 [38, 39]. However, the role played by BinCARD in the replication cycle of IAV is unknown, and the regulation of its function has not been reported, which prompted us to undertake this study.Materials and methodsCells and virusesHuman lung carcinoma cells (A549), human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293T), Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK), and murine macrophage cells (RAW264.7) were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator in F-12K medium (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Sigma‒Aldrich), Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM; Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% FBS, DMEM supplemented with 6% newborn calf serum (NCS; Sigma‒Aldrich), and RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% FBS, respectively. All media contained 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies).A/WSN/33 (WSN, H1N1) virus was propagated in MDCK cells cultured in MEM containing 0.3% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma‒Aldrich) and 0.5 μg/ml L-1-tosylamide-2-phenylmethyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin (Sigma‒Aldrich). A/Anhui/2/2005 (AH05, H5N1) and A/Anhui/1/2013 (AH13, H7N9) were cultured in 10-day-old embryonated chicken eggs. Sendai virus (SeV) was provided by Dr. Jin Tian [Harbin Veterinary Research Institute (HVRI), Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (CAAS), China].All experiments with live H5N1 and H7N9 viruses were conducted in the enhanced animal biosafety level 3 (ABSL3+) facility at HVRI, CAAS, which was approved for use by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of the People’s Republic of China and the China National Accreditation Service for Conformity Assessment.AntibodiesThe following primary antibodies were obtained from commercial sources: mouse anti-BinCARD1 (102-228 aa) mAb (Beijing Protein Innovation), rabbit anti-BinCARD pAb (PA5-89068, Thermo Fisher Scientific), mouse anti-Flag mAb (F3165, Sigma‒Aldrich), rabbit anti-Flag pAb (F7425, Sigma‒Aldrich), rabbit anti-HA mAb (3724, Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit anti-GAPDH pAb (10494-1-AP, Proteintech), mouse anti-GST mAb (A00865, GenScript), rabbit anti-GST pAb (A00097, GenScript), rabbit anti-LaminB1 pAb (12987-1-AP, Proteintech), mouse anti-Myc mAb (M4439, Sigma‒Aldrich), rabbit anti-Myc pAb (C3956, Sigma‒Aldrich), mouse anti-TRAF3 mAb (sc-6933, Santa Cruz), rabbit anti-MAVS mAb (83000, Cell Signaling Technology), mouse anti-p62 mAb (88588, Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit anti-phospho-SQSTM1/p62 (Ser403) mAb (39786, Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit anti-IRF3-p mAb (29047, Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit anti-TBK1 mAb (3504, Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit anti-LC3B pAb (2775, Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit anti-M1 pAb (GTX125928, GeneTex), mouse anti-ubiquitin mAb (sc-8017, Santa Cruz), and rabbit anti-ubiquitin (linkage-specific K63) mAb (ab179434, Abcam). The mouse anti-PB2, PB1, PA and NP mAbs were produced as previously described [40]. The rabbit anti-NP pAb was produced and stored in our laboratory. The secondary antibodies used for western blotting were DyLight 800 goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L) (RS23910) and DyLight 800 goat anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) (RS23920), purchased from ImmunoWay; the secondary antibodies used for confocal microscopy were Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L) (A11029), Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) (A11034), Alexa Fluor 633 goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L) (A21052) and Alexa Fluor 633 goat anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) (A21071), which were obtained from Life Technologies.Construction of plasmidsThe open reading frames (ORFs) of the human BinCARD1 and BinCARD2 genes obtained from total cellular mRNAs of A549 cells were amplified by RT‒PCR and cloned into the pCAGGS vector with a Flag, GST or Myc tag at the N-terminus or C-terminus. The pCAGGS plasmids bearing the ORFs of the PB2, PB1, PA, and NP genes of WSN (H1N1) virus as well as truncation mutants of GST-tagged WSN NP were constructed as described previously [20]. The construction of pHH21-SC09NS F-Luc, which was used to produce an influenza vRNA-like luciferase reporter, and an ISRE-Luc reporter has been previously described [20, 41]. The ORFs of human IMP α1, IMP α3, IMP α5, IMP α7, and IMP β1 with a Flag tag at the N-terminus were cloned into a pCAGGS vector. The pCAGGS constructs bearing a Flag tag in the C-terminus of the ORFs of human RIG-I, MAVS, TRAF3, TBK1, IKKε and IRF3 were generated as described previously [41]. The ORFs of human OPTN and p62/SQSTM1 with a Myc tag at the C-terminus were cloned into pCAGGS, and the ORF of human ubiquitin was cloned into pCAGGS with an HA tag in the N-terminus. Truncation mutants of GST-BinCARD1 and TBK1-Flag were generated using a PCR approach and cloned into pCAGGS. Point mutants of GST-BinCARD1, HA-tagged ubiquitin, and TRAF3-Flag were generated using the Fast Mutagenesis System (Transgen). All plasmid constructs were confirmed by sequencing.siRNA treatment and virus infectionsiRNA targeting BinCARD, BinCARD2, or scrambled siRNA was transfected at a concentration of 30 nM with the Lipofectamine RNAiMAX transfection reagent (Invitrogen) into A549 cells cultured in 12-well plates. At 36 h post-transfection (p.t.), the knockdown efficiency was determined by qRT‒PCR, confocal microscopy or western blotting. The siRNA-treated A549 cells were infected with WSN (H1N1) (MOI = 0.01), AH05 (H5N1) (MOI = 0.1), or AH13 (H7N9) (MOI = 0.1) viruses. Supernatants were collected at the indicated timepoints, and virus titers were determined by plaque assays in MDCK cells.Generation of BinCARD_KO A549 cells and virus infectionBinCARD_KO A549 cells were established with the CRISPR/Cas9 system. The BinCARD gene target sequences, 5’-CACCGGTGGGTAGTAACGGTTCAGC-3’ and 5’-CACCGCTGCACCAGGCGGTCACAAT-3’, were inserted into a pSpCas9(BB)-2A-GFP (pX458) vector, which harbored a cassette for expressing Cas9 and EGFP. Six micrograms of each pX458 construct carrying one of the BinCARD targeting sequences was coelectrotransfected into A549 cells. Electrotransfected cells were trypsinized 48 h later, and single cells were then seeded into each well of a 96-well plate and subjected to fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) with a SH800S Cell Sorter (Sony Biotechnology). Knockout of BinCARD expression was confirmed by sequencing, confocal microscopy, and western blotting. BinCARD_KO A549 cells or control cells were infected with WSN (H1N1) (MOI = 0.01), AH05 (H5N1) (MOI = 0.1), or AH13 (H7N9) (MOI = 0.1) virus. Supernatants were collected at 24 and 48 h p.i., and virus titers were determined by plaque assays in MDCK cells.Generation of BinCARD1- and BinCARD2-overexpressing A549 cell lines and virus infectionThe human BinCARD1 and BinCARD2 genes were cloned into a pLVX-ISRE-ZsGreen1 vector (Clontech). HEK293T cells cultured in 10-cm dishes were transfected with pLVX-BinCARD1, pLVX-BinCARD2 or an empty pLVX vector with Lipofectamine LTX and Plus reagents (Invitrogen). At 48 h p.t., the lentiviruses produced were collected and used to infect A549 cells in the presence of 6 mg/mL polybrene. Three days later, the surviving cells were sorted on a SH800S Cell Sorter with ZsGreen used as a marker. The sorted cells were individually cloned into 12-well plates, propagated, and examined for BinCARD1 and BinCARD2 overexpression via western blotting analysis. The two overexpressing cell lines or control cells were infected with WSN (H1N1) virus (MOI = 0.01). Supernatants were collected at 24 and 48 h p.i., and virus titers were determined by plaque assays in MDCK cells.Plaque assayPlaque assays were performed with MDCK cells in 12-well plates as described previously [42]. Briefly, MDCK cells infected with 10-fold serial dilutions of virus samples in 1 × MEM (0.3% BSA) were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The cells were then washed with PBS and covered with 1% SeaPlaque agarose (Lonza) in 1 × MEM containing 0.3% BSA and 0.5 μg/mL TPCK-treated trypsin. After a 48–72 h incubation, the cells were fixed with formalin, and the plaques were stained with 0.1% crystal violet and counted.Confocal microscopyA549 cells subjected to the indicated treatments were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 30 min and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min. The permeabilized cells were blocked with 5% BSA in PBS for 1 h and then incubated with the indicated primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight. The cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit or mouse IgG (H + L) and/or Alexa Fluor 633 goat anti-mouse or rabbit IgG (H + L) for 1 h. After three washes, the cells were incubated with DAPI (4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 15 min to stain the nuclei. Images were acquired with an LSM 800 confocal microscope with Airyscan (Zeiss).RNA quantificationTotal RNA was extracted from siRNA-treated A549 cells or HEK293T cells at 36 h p.t. with an RNeasy kit (QIAGEN). The first-strand cDNAs were synthesized with an oligo(dT) primer and random 6-mers with a PrimeScript RT reagent kit with gDNA Eraser (TaKaRa). Real-time PCR was performed using SYBR premix Ex Taq II (TaKaRa). Relative BinCARD mRNA quantities were determined by using the comparative cycle-threshold method, with cellular GAPDH serving as the endogenous reference and scrambled siRNA-treated cells serving as the controls.HEK293T cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing BinCARD1 or empty vector, and at 36 h p.t., the cells were stimulated with SeV (50 HAU/mL) or poly (I:C) (10 μg/mL) for 6 h. Total RNA was extracted and reverse transcribed as described above. Relative RNA quantities of ISG15 and OAS1 were determined by the comparative cycle-threshold method, with cellular GAPDH serving as the endogenous reference and empty vector transfected cells serving as the controls.A549 cells were transfected with BinCARD siRNA1 or scrambled siRNA, and at 36 h p.t., the cells were infected with WSN (H1N1) virus (MOI = 5). At 3 and 6 h p.i., the levels of vRNA, mRNA, and cRNA derived from the NP gene were measured by RT‒qPCR as described previously [20].Cell viability assayA CellTiter-Glo kit (Promega) was used to determine the cell viability as described previously [42]. Briefly, A549 cells seeded in opaque-walled 96-well plates were transfected with siRNA targeting BinCARD or BinCARD2 or with scrambled siRNA at a concentration of 30 nM. At 36 h p.t., 100 μl of CellTiter-Glo reagent was added directly to each well for 10 min to lyse the cells. Alternatively, BinCARD_KO A549 cells and A549 control cells were grown in opaque-walled 96-well plates until reaching confluency, and then cell lysates were prepared with CellTiter-Glo reagent. The luminescence of the cell lysates was measured with a GloMax 96 microplate luminometer.Dual-luciferase reporter assayHEK293T cells treated for 36 h with siRNA targeting BinCARD or scrambled siRNA were transfected with pCAGGS constructs expressing the PB2, PB1, PA, and NP proteins (0.5 μg each) of WSN (H1N1) virus, the construct pHH21-SC09NS F-Luc (0.1 μg), and an internal control, pRL-TK (50 ng, Promega) using Lipofectamine LTX and Plus reagents (Invitrogen). In a separate experiment, HEK293T cells were transfected with pCAGGS constructs expressing the PB2, PB1, PA, and NP proteins of WSN (H1N1) virus and different amounts of BinCARD1-expressing plasmids, pHH21-SC09NS F-Luc, and pRL-TK. At 36 h p.t., cell lysates were prepared with a dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega), and the luciferase activities were measured on a GloMax 96 microplate luminometer (Promega). The cell lysates were subjected to western blotting to measure the expression levels of PB2, PB1, PA, and NP in the vRNP complex.HEK293T cells were first transfected with an empty pCAGGS vector or pCAGGS-Flag-BinCARD1, the ISRE-Luc reporter plasmid (0.2 μg) and the pRL-TK control plasmid (0.01 μg). At 36 h p.t., the cells were either left untreated or stimulated with SeV (50 HAU/mL) or poly (I:C) (10 μg/mL) for 12 h. The overexpression of BinCARD1 was confirmed by western blotting with a rabbit anti-Flag pAb. The luciferase activity of the transfected cells was determined by performing a dual-luciferase reporter assay.Western blottingProtein samples separated by SDS‒PAGE were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare). The membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk in PBS at room temperature for 1 h, followed by incubation overnight at 4 °C with the appropriately diluted primary antibody in PBS containing 0.5% BSA. After further incubation at 4 °C for 1 h with DyLight 800 goat anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) and DyLight 800 goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L), the blots were visualized with an Odyssey CLX infrared imaging system (Li-Cor BioSciences).Co-IP assayTo examine interactions between proteins, HEK293T cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids with the Lipofectamine LTX and Plus Reagents (Invitrogen). Thirty-six hours later, the cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed with IP lysis buffer (Pierce) that included a complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics GmbH) and PMSF for 30 min on ice. Cell lysates were then centrifuged at 12,000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min. The supernatants were incubated with the indicated primary antibodies at 4 °C for 6–8 h, mixed with Protein G-Agarose beads (Roche) and rocked at 4 °C for 6–8 h. The beads were then washed three times with PBS containing 1% PMSF, and the bound proteins were separated by SDS‒PAGE and detected by western blotting.GST pull-down assayHEK293T cells grown in 6-well plates were transfected with the indicated plasmids. At 36 h p.t., the cells were lysed with 250 μL of IP buffer. The lysates were pulled down with 8 μL of glutathione magnetic agarose (Invitrogen) for 8 h and then analyzed by western blotting.Cell fractionationBinCARD_KO A549 cells and A549 control cells grown in 6-well plates were infected with WSN (H1N1) virus (MOI = 5). At 3 and 4 h p.i., the cells were separated into nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions with NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents (Pierce) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The amount of NP in each fraction was determined by western blotting with a mouse anti-NP mAb. Lamin B1 and GAPDH, which are nuclear and cytoplasmic fraction markers, respectively, were detected by western blotting with a rabbit anti-GAPDH pAb and a rabbit anti-Lamin B1 pAb, respectively.Ubiquitination assayHEK293T cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids, including constructs expressing HA-tagged ubiquitin or its mutants. At 36 h p.t., whole-cell lysate proteins were immunoprecipitated with the appropriate primary antibodies or incubated with glutathione magnetic agarose and analyzed by western blotting.To determine whether BinCARD1 can induce K63-linked polyubiquitination of TRAF3 in infected cells, RAW264.7 cells were transfected with an empty vector or BinCARD1-expressing constructs, and at 48 h p.t., the cells were infected with SeV (50 HAU/mL). At 0 and 6 h p.i., whole-cell lysate proteins were immunoprecipitated with a mouse anti-TRAF3 mAb and analyzed by western blotting.Autophagy inhibitor and inducer treatmentsTo determine the pathway through which TBK1 degrades BinCARD1, HEK293T cells were first transfected to express BinCARD1, and 12 h later, the cells were transfected with an empty pCAGGS vector or pCAGGS-TBK1. Twenty-four hours later, the cells were treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (8 mM) or the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) (5 mg/mL) or bafilomycin A1 (Baf A1) (1 μM) for 8 h. Cell lysates were analyzed by western blotting with a mouse anti-BinCARD1 mAb and a rabbit anti-TBK1 mAb.HEK293T cells were transfected with pCAGGS-BinCARD1, and at 24 h p.t., the autophagy inducers rapamycin (5 μM) and EBSS were added to stimulate the cells for 24 h and 2 h, respectively. Cell lysates were analyzed by western blotting with a mouse anti-BinCARD1 mAb.Statistical analysisStatistical significance was determined by two-tailed unpaired Student’s t test or analysis of variance (ANOVA) test with GraphPad Prism 7.0 software. P values < 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.ResultsIAV employs BinCARD1 for efficient replicationBinCARD was identified to be a potential proviral host factor for the replication of IAV in a previous whole-genome siRNA library screen performed with a replication-competent Venus-expressing H5N1 virus [43]. To determine whether BinCARD affects the replication of IAV, A549 cells were transfected with siRNA. For technical reasons, we designed only two siRNAs targeting the CCD region of the two BinCARD isoforms, as well as two siRNAs targeting BinCARD2. At 36 h p.t., the siRNA knockdown efficiency was verified by RT‒qPCR (Fig. 1A, B). Knocking down both BinCARD isoforms or only BinCARD2 with different siRNAs exerted no major effect on cell viability, as measured by a luminescent cell viability assay (Supplementary Fig. 1). The effect of siRNA knockdown of BinCARD on IAV replication was then evaluated after WSN (H1N1) virus infection. We found that when both BinCARD isoforms were simultaneously knocked down in A549 cells, the growth titers of WSN (H1N1) virus were reduced by 15- and 12-fold at 24 h post-infection (p.i.) and 8- and 4-fold at 48 h p.i. However, no significant changes in virus titers were observed between the A549 cells treated with siRNAs targeting BinCARD2 and those treated with scrambled siRNA (Fig. 1C, D). These results indicate that BinCARD1, but not BinCARD2, was required for the efficient replication of IAV. We also selected BinCARD siRNA1, whose downregulating effect on the expression of BinCARD/BinCARD1 at the protein level was confirmed by both confocal microscopy and western blotting (Supplementary Fig. 2A, B). We then examined the effect of reduced BinCARD/BinCARD1 protein levels on the levels of vRNA, mRNA, and cRNA of the NP gene in A549 cells infected with WSN (H1N1) virus. We found that the levels of all three species of viral RNA in the BinCARD siRNA1-treated cells were significantly lower than those in the scrambled siRNA-treated cells at both 3 h p.i. and 6 h p.i. (Supplementary Fig. 3A, B), thereby confirming that BinCARD1 was important for the efficient replication of WSN (H1N1) virus. In addition, the role played by BinCARD1 in the replication of IAV was validated by analyses performed with AH05 (H5N1) and AH13 (H7N9) viruses. We found that treatment with BinCARD siRNA1 in A549 cells led to AH05 (H5N1) and AH13 (H7N9) virus titer reductions of 23- and 13-fold at 24 h p.i. and 21- and 10-fold at 48 h p.i., respectively (Fig. 1E, F). These data demonstrate that BinCARD1 is required by a wide range of IAVs for efficient replication.Fig. 1BinCARD1 promotes IAV replication. SiRNA knockdown of BinCARD and BinCARD2 in A549 cells. A549 cells were transfected with siRNA targeting BinCARD (A) or BinCARD2 (B) or with scrambled siRNA. At 36 h p.t., the knockdown efficiency was determined by RT‒qPCR. ***P < 0.001.

Supernatants were collected at the indicated timepoints, and virus titers were determined by plaque assays in MDCK cells. ***P < 0.001. The data represent the mean ± SD of three independent experiments (A–F, H–J, L)Full size imageWe next generated the BinCARD-knockout (BinCARD_KO) A549 cell line with the CRISPR/Cas9 system to confirm the positive regulatory effect of BinCARD1 on the replication of IAV. BinCARD/BinCARD1 knockout in BinCARD_KO A549 cells compared with that in control cells was confirmed by confocal microscopy and western blot analysis (Fig. 1G and Supplementary Fig. 4A). BinCARD knockout led to no major effect on cell viability (Supplementary Fig. 4B). The titers of WSN (H1N1) virus produced by BinCARD_KO A549 cells were 26- and 20-fold lower than those of control cells at 24 and 48 h p.i., respectively (Fig. 1H). Consistent with these data, 34-/24-fold and 27-/21-fold reductions in AH05 (H5N1) and AH13 (H7N9) virus titers were observed at 24/48 h p.i., respectively, in BinCARD_KO A549 cells compared with control cells (Fig. 1I, J).To verify that BinCARD1 was solely responsible for the observed effect of BinCARD on IAV replication, we established BinCARD1-A549 and BinCARD2-A549 cell lines stably overexpressing BinCARD1 and BinCARD2, respectively, using a lentiviral system (Fig. 1K). We found that the titers of WSN (H1N1) virus in the BinCARD1-A549 cells were 5- and 4-fold higher at 24 and 48 h p.i. than those of the control cells. In contrast, overexpression of BinCARD2 in the BinCARD2-A549 cells did not affect the replication of WSN (H1N1) virus (Fig. 1L). Taken together, these data indicate that BinCARD1 positively regulated the replication of IAV.To evaluate the biological significance of BinCARD1 in the replication cycle of IAV, we determined the expression profile of BinCARD1 in the course of IAV infection. A549 cells were infected with WSN (H1N1) virus (MOI = 0.01), and the level of BinCARD1 was measured by western blotting with a mouse anti-BinCARD1 mAb. We found that the level of BinCARD1 was gradually increased by infection with WSN (H1N1) virus. The level of BinCARD1 peaked at 24–36 h p.i. and then clearly decreased at 48 h p.i., suggesting that BinCARD1 function was important in the replication cycle of IAV (Supplementary Fig. 5).BinCARD1 positively regulates the nuclear import of the vRNP complex and newly synthesized NPTo define the specific stage of the IAV replication cycle in which BinCARD1 is engaged, we first examined whether BinCARD1 plays a role in viral internalization. BinCARD siRNA1- or scrambled siRNA-treated A549 cells were infected with WSN (H1N1) virus (MOI = 5) for 1 h on ice at 4 °C, and then, the temperature was changed to 37 °C for 30 min to allow viral internalization. After removing virions retained on the cell surface by washing with PBS (pH = 1.3), the amount of internalized viral NP protein was evaluated by western blotting. The amount of NP inside the BinCARD siRNA1-treated A549 cells was similar to that in the scrambled siRNA-treated cells (Fig. 2A), indicating that knocking down BinCARD1 expression had no adverse effect on the viral endocytic process. Next, we asked whether BinCARD1 affects the uncoating process of virus upon entry into cells. SiRNA-treated A549 cells were infected with a high dose of WSN (H1N1) virus (MOI = 50) in the presence of cycloheximide (CHX, 50 μg/mL) to exclude the influence of newly synthesized proteins. The cells were fixed at 1.5 h p.i., stained with an anti-M1 pAb to reveal the uncoating process, and visualized with confocal microscopy. We found that M1 was distributed as puncta in cells treated with siRNA against vATPase (the positive control), indicating that virions were not uncoated (Fig. 2B). In contrast, M1 was diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm of A549 cells treated with BinCARD siRNA1 or scrambled siRNA, indicating completion of the uncoating process; no difference in M1 distribution was observed between the cells treated with BinCARD siRNA1 or scrambled siRNA. Hence, knocking down BinCARD1 did not affect virion uncoating. Together, these results clearly indicate that BinCARD1 was neither involved in the internalization nor the uncoating process in the early stage of the IAV replication cycle.Fig. 2BinCARD1 positively regulates the nuclear import of the vRNP complex and newly synthesized NP. A The effect of BinCARD siRNA1 treatment on the internalization of IAV was analyzed. BinCARD siRNA1- or scrambled siRNA-treated A549 cells were infected with WSN (H1N1) virus (MOI = 5) on ice at 4 °C for 1 h, incubated at 37 °C for 30 min to allow viral internalization, and washed with ice-cold PBS (pH = 1.3) to remove uninternalized viral particles. Cell lysates were subjected to western blotting with a mouse anti-NP mAb to detect the amount of internalized virus particles. B The effect of BinCARD siRNA1 treatment on the uncoating process of IAV was analyzed. BinCARD siRNA1-, scrambled siRNA- or vATPase siRNA-treated A549 cells were treated with CHX to inhibit protein synthesis and were then infected with WSN (H1N1) (MOI = 50) virus. At 1.5 h p.i., the infected cells were stained with a rabbit anti-M1 pAb and Alexa Fluor 633 goat anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) (red) and visualized by confocal microscopy. C The effect of BinCARD siRNA1 treatment on the cellular localization of NP during IAV infection was determined by confocal microscopy. BinCARD siRNA1- or scrambled siRNA-treated A549 cells were infected with WSN (H1N1) (MOI = 5) virus. At 2, 3, 4 and 5 h p.i., the infected cells were fixed and stained with a mouse anti-NP mAb, followed by incubation with Alexa Fluor 633 goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L) (red). The nuclei were stained with DAPI. D Quantitative analysis of NP localization in virus-infected BinCARD siRNA1-treated cells. On the basis of the confocal microscopy images presented in C, the localization of NP (indicative of vRNP localization) upon the appearance of its nuclear localization was divided into the following categories: weak nuclear localization, strong nuclear localization, simultaneous localization at the boundary between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, or predominant cytoplasmic localization. The data shown are derived from 100 cells visualized by confocal microscopy with a 40X objective lens. E The effect of BinCARD1 knockout on the nuclear import of the vRNP complex was determined through a cell fractionation experiment. BinCARD_KO A549 cells and A549 control cells were infected with WSN (H1N1) (MOI = 5) virus. At 3 h p.i., the cells were separated into nuclear (N) and cytoplasmic (C) fractions. The proteins in each fraction were subjected to western blotting with a mouse anti-NP mAb. Densitometric analysis of the western blots was performed with ImageJ software. Lamin B1 and GAPDH were used as the loading controls for the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions, respectively. F The effect of BinCARD1 knockout on the nuclear import of NP was assessed by confocal microscopy. BinCARD_KO A549 cells and A549 control cells were transfected with a vector to express WSNNP. At 20 h p.t., the cells were stained with a mouse anti-NP mAb and a rabbit anti-BinCARD pAb, incubated with Alexa Fluor 633 goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L) (red) and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) (green), and visualized by confocal microscopyFull size imageTo determine whether BinCARD1 modulates the nuclear import of the vRNP complex, we monitored the cellular localization of NP during the course of IAV infection in siRNA-treated A549 cells. A549 cells were treated with BinCARD siRNA1 or scrambled siRNA and infected with WSN (H1N1) virus (MOI = 5). At 2, 3, 4, and 5 h p.i., the cellular distribution of NP was visualized by confocal microscopy. NP clearly accumulated in the nucleus of approximately 35% and 88% of the scrambled siRNA-treated cells at 2 and 3 h p.i., respectively. However, the ratio of cells with NP accumulation in the nucleus of BinCARD siRNA1-treated cells was 2% and 8%, respectively, at the same timepoints. These results indicate that the vRNP complex is detained in the cytoplasm at 2 and 3 h p.i. in BinCARD siRNA1-treated cells. Due to the defect in the nuclear import of the vRNP complex, the replication cycle of IAV was delayed in the BinCARD siRNA1-treated cells, as indicated by the localization of NP at 4 and 5 h p.i. (Fig. 2C, D). The role played by BinCARD1 in the nuclear import of the vRNP complex after IAV infection was also examined in BinCARD_KO A549 cells. We found that the nuclear import of the vRNP complex was suppressed and that the overall viral replication cycle was delayed in the BinCARD_KO A549 cells compared with the A549 control cells (Supplementary Fig. 6A, B).We next validated the inhibitory effect of BinCARD1 knockout on the nuclear import of the vRNP complex by performing a cell fractionation experiment. BinCARD_KO and control A549 cells were infected with WSN (H1N1) virus (MOI = 5). At 3 h p.i., the infected cells were lysed, and the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were separated and subjected to western blotting. The marker proteins GAPDH and LaminB1 were detected only in the cytoplasm and nucleus, respectively (Fig. 2E). Notably, the amount of NP detected in the nucleus of the BinCARD_KO A549 cells was much lower than that of the control cells (Fig. 2E). These results demonstrate that knocking out BinCARD1 expression suppressed the nuclear accumulation of the vRNP complex, thereby inhibiting viral life cycle progression.We further investigated the effect of BinCARD1 on the nuclear import of NP protein. BinCARD_KO A549 cells and A549 control cells were transfected with a WSNNP-expressing construct, and the cellular localization of NP was visualized at 20 h p.t. NP accumulated in the nucleus of the A549 control cells but was predominantly retained in the cytoplasm of the BinCARD_KO A549 cells (Fig. 2F).Collectively, these data demonstrate that BinCARD1 promoted the nuclear import of both the vRNP complex and newly synthesized NP.BinCARD1 increases the vRNP complex activity of IAVThe vRNP complex is critical for the transcription and replication of the IAV genome [7]. Given the role played by BinCARD1 in the nuclear import of the vRNP complex, we speculated that BinCARD1 might increase vRNP complex activity. To test this hypothesis, we transfected HEK293T cells with BinCARD siRNA1 or scrambled siRNA. A RT‒qPCR analysis showed that BinCARD-specific siRNA treatment indeed downregulated the expression of BinCARD at 36 h p.t. (Fig. 3A). SiRNA-treated cells were then transfected with protein expression constructs for the PB2, PB1, PA, and NP of WSN (H1N1) virus, along with a reporter plasmid for the generation of a vRNA-like luciferase gene [20, 44, 45]. Thirty-six hours later, the luciferase activity in the cell lysates was measured to determine vRNP complex activity. We found that the vRNP activity was decreased by 33% in cells treated with BinCARD siRNA1 compared with cells treated with scrambled siRNA (Fig. 3B). The level of each vRNP complex protein remained unchanged between the two types of siRNA-treated cells, indicating that BinCARD1 did not exert an effect on vRNP complex activity by changing the expression levels of vRNP complex proteins. To confirm the result observed in siRNA-treated cells, the vRNP complex activity of WSN (H1N1) virus was assessed in the presence of exogenously expressed BinCARD1. We found that BinCARD1 overexpression led to dose-dependent increases in vRNP complex activity without affecting the expression level of any vRNP complex protein (Fig. 3C). These data demonstrate that BinCARD1 positively regulated the vRNP complex activity of IAV.Fig. 3BinCARD1 increases the vRNP complex activity of IAV. A SiRNA knockdown of BinCARD in HEK293T cells. HEK293T cells were transfected with BinCARD siRNA1 or scrambled siRNA, and at 36 h p.t., the cells were subjected to RT‒qPCR analysis to determine the effect of BinCARD knockdown. ***P < 0.001. B The vRNP complex activity of IAV in BinCARD siRNA1-treated HEK293T cells. HEK293T cells treated with BinCARD siRNA1 or scrambled siRNA as described in A were further transfected with the set of plasmids for the evaluation of vRNP complex activity, including the four RNP protein expression constructs (PB2, PB1, PA, and NP) derived from WSN (H1N1) virus, pHH21-SC09NS F-Luc, and pRL-TK. Thirty-six hours later, a dual-luciferase assay was performed in which the relative firefly luciferase activity was normalized to the luciferase activity of the Renilla, the internal control. The expression of vRNP complex proteins was measured by western blotting with a mouse anti-PB2, PB1, PA, or NP mAb. ***P < 0.001. C The vRNP complex activity of IAV in HEK293T cells was increased with progressively increased BinCARD1 expression. HEK293T cells were transfected with the set of plasmids for the evaluation of vRNP complex activity as described in B, together with an empty vector or gradually increasing amounts of BinCARD1-expressing constructs. Thirty-six hours later, a dual-luciferase assay was performed as described in B. The expression of the BinCARD1 and vRNP complex proteins was measured by western blotting with a mouse anti-BinCARD1, PB2, PB1, PA, or NP mAb. **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001. The data represent the mean ± SD of three independent experiments (A–C)Full size imageBinCARD1 interacts with IAV NPThe nuclear import of the vRNP complex after IAV infection is mediated by the interaction between NP and IMP α isoforms. Since BinCARD1 positively regulated the nuclear import of the vRNP complex and NP, we investigated whether BinCARD1 binds to NP by performing co-IP experiments. HEK293T cells were transfected with V5-tagged WSNNP and Flag-tagged BinCARD1 individually or in combination, and cell lysate proteins were immunoprecipitated with a mouse anti-NP mAb or anti-Flag mAb, and then, western blotting with a rabbit anti-NP pAb or anti-Flag pAb was performed. A clear interaction between NP and BinCARD1 was observed (Fig. 4A, B). Given that the RNA-binding activity of NP is important for its function in the life cycle of IAV, we performed a co-IP experiment with cell lysates that had been first treated with RNase A/T1 to determine whether the interaction between NP and BinCARD1 depends on the RNA-binding activity of NP. We found that the interaction between BinCARD1 and NP was not affected by the removal of the RNA components in the lysates of the transfected cells (Fig. 4C), indicating that the BinCARD1 and NP interaction did not rely on the RNA-binding activity of NP. We also examined the interaction between NP and BinCARD1 in infected cells. HEK293T cells transfected with plasmids expressing Flag-BinCARD1 were infected with WSN (H1N1) virus and then subjected to co-IP. We found that BinCARD1 interacted with NP during the course of IAV infection (Fig. 4D). Furthermore, we examined the interaction between NP and BinCARD1 via confocal microscopy and found that WSNNP and Flag-BinCARD1 colocalized in the nucleus and cytoplasm of transiently transfected A549 cells (Fig. 4E).Fig. 4BinCARD1 interacts with NP. A, B A co-IP assay was performed to examine the interaction between NP and BinCARD1. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing V5-WSNNP and Flag-BinCARD1 individually or in combination. At 36 h p.t., cell lysate proteins were immunoprecipitated with a mouse anti-NP mAb (A) or a mouse anti-Flag mAb (B) and subjected to western blotting with a rabbit anti-NP pAb or a rabbit anti-Flag pAb. C The BinCARD1-NP interaction did not rely on the RNA-binding activity of NP. HEK293T cells were transfected as described in A, B. Cell lysates treated with RNase A/T1 or left untreated were immunoprecipitated with a mouse anti-Flag mAb, and the proteins were subjected to western blotting with a rabbit anti-NP pAb or a rabbit anti-Flag pAb. D A co-IP assay was performed to examine the interaction between NP and BinCARD1 in virus-infected cells. HEK293T cells were transfected with vectors to express Flag-BinCARD1, and at 36 h p.t., the cells were infected with WSN (H1N1) virus (MOI = 5) for 12 h. Cell lysate proteins were immunoprecipitated with a mouse anti-Flag mAb and then subjected to western blotting with a rabbit anti-NP pAb or a rabbit anti-Flag pAb. E Colocalization of NP and BinCARD1 was detected by confocal microscopy. A549 cells were transfected with plasmids expressing WSNNP and Flag-BinCARD1 individually or in combination. At 20 h p.t., the cells were stained with a mouse anti-NP mAb and a rabbit anti-Flag pAb, incubated with Alexa Fluor 633 goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L) (red) and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) (green), and visualized by confocal microscopy. F, G Co-IP assays were performed to examine the interaction between truncation mutants of NP and BinCARD1. HEK293T cells were transfected with the indicated constructs. At 36 h p.t., cell lysates were pulled down with glutathione magnetic beads. The bound proteins were eluted and subjected to western blotting with a rabbit anti-NP pAb, a rabbit anti-Flag pAb, or a rabbit anti-GST pAbFull size imageNext, we investigated the key regions within NP and BinCARD1 that are critical for their interaction. Five previously generated NP truncation constructs were used to express peptides with only the amino acid regions of 1–80, 1–162, 1–271, 1–351, and 268–498 [20]. Similarly, we generated two truncation constructs of BinCARD1, one expressed the N-terminal 1–100 amino acids and the other expressing the C-terminal 101–228 amino acids. A GST tag was fused to each truncated NP and BinCARD1 construct at the N-terminus. We then examined the interaction between BinCARD1 and GST-NP truncation mutants as well as the interaction between NP and GST-BinCARD1 truncation mutants by performing a GST pull-down assay. The C-terminal 352–498 amino acid region of NP was found to mediate the interaction of NP with BinCARD1 (Fig. 4F), and the C-terminal 101–228 amino acid region of BinCARD1 was found to be critical for BinCARD1 binding with NP (Fig. 4G).BinCARD1 facilitates the binding of NP with IMP α7It had previously been reported that the nuclear import of NP was mediated by its association with IMP α1, α3, α5, or α7 and the subsequent binding of IMP β1 [16, 17]. Given that BinCARD1 interacts with NP and facilitates the nuclear import of the vRNP complex and newly synthesized NP, we hypothesized that BinCARD1 might affect the interaction between NP and IMP α isoforms or the subsequent recruitment of IMP β1. To test this hypothesis, we determined whether BinCARD1 interacts with IMP α isoforms or IMP β1 by performing co-IP assays. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing Myc-tagged BinCARD1 and Flag-tagged IMP α1, α3, α5, α7, or β1 individually or in combination. Cell lysate proteins were immunoprecipitated with a mouse anti-Myc or anti-Flag mAb, and then, western blotting was performed with a rabbit anti-Myc or anti-Flag pAb. The data revealed that BinCARD1 did not interact with IMP α1, α3, α5, or β1 (Fig. 5A–D). In contrast, we discovered that BinCARD1 interacts with IMP α7 (Fig. 5E, F). The interaction between BinCARD1 and IMP α7 was also observed during the course of IAV infection, as determined with a co-IP assay performed with HEK293T cells transfected with plasmids expressing Flag-BinCARD1 and subsequently infected with WSN (H1N1) virus (Fig. 5G).Fig. 5BinCARD1 facilitates the binding of NP with IMP α7. A–D Co-IP assays were performed to examine the interaction between BinCARD1 and IMP α1, α3, α5, and β1. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing Myc-tagged BinCARD1 and Flag-tagged IMP α1 (A), α3 (B), α5 (C), or β1 (D) individually or in combination. At 36 h p.t., cell lysate proteins were immunoprecipitated with a mouse anti-Myc mAb or a mouse anti-Flag mAb and subjected to western blotting with a rabbit anti-Myc pAb or a rabbit anti-Flag pAb. E, F A co-IP assay was performed to examine the interaction between BinCARD1 and IMP α7. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing Myc-tagged BinCARD1 and Flag-tagged IMP α7 individually or in combination. At 36 h p.t., cell lysate proteins were immunoprecipitated with a mouse anti-Flag mAb (E) or a mouse anti-Myc mAb (F) and subjected to western blotting with a rabbit anti-Myc pAb or a rabbit anti-Flag pAb. G A co-IP assay was performed to examine the interaction between BinCARD1 and endogenous IMP α7 during IAV infection. HEK293T cells were transfected with vectors to express Flag-tagged BinCARD1, and at 36 h p.t., the cells were infected with WSN (H1N1) virus (MOI = 5) for 12 h. Cell lysate proteins were immunoprecipitated with a mouse anti-Flag mAb and subjected to western blotting with a rabbit anti-IMP α7 pAb or a rabbit anti-Flag pAb. H Western blotting analysis to determine the effect of gradually increasing BinCARD1 expression on the expression of IMP α7. HEK293T cells were transfected with vectors to express Flag-tagged IMP α7 and gradually increasing levels of BinCARD1. At 36 h p.t., cell lysate proteins were western blotted with a rabbit anti-Flag pAb and a mouse anti-BinCARD1 mAb. I Co-IP assays were performed to examine the relationship among NP, IMP α7, and BinCARD1. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing WSNNP, Flag-tagged IMP α7, and gradually increasing amounts of Myc-tagged BinCARD1 individually or in combination. At 36 h p.t., cell lysate proteins were immunoprecipitated with a mouse anti-Flag mAb and subjected to western blotting with a rabbit anti-NP pAb, a rabbit anti-Flag pAb, or a rabbit anti-Myc pAbFull size imageWe next investigated the biological effect of the interaction between BinCARD1 and IMP α7. We found that increasing the amount of BinCARD1 in HEK293T cells exerted no effect on the expression level of IMP α7 (Fig. 5H). We further examined whether the interaction between BinCARD1 and IMP α7 promotes complex formation between NP and IMP α7, thus facilitating the nuclear import of NP through the classical nuclear import pathway. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing WSNNP and Flag-tagged IMP α7, together with gradually increasing amounts of the Myc-tagged BinCARD1 construct. The co-IP assay showed that the amount of NP that coimmunoprecipitated with IMP α7 was significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner when BinCARD1 was coexpressed (Fig. 5I). This result indicates that the presence of BinCARD1 promoted the formation of a complex between NP and IMP α7, thereby facilitating the nuclear import of the vRNP complex.BinCARD1 activates RIG-I innate immune signaling by promoting the K63-linked ubiquitination of TRAF3When host factors promote the replication of IAV, it is inevitable that mechanisms of host antagonism are activated. Type I IFN plays an important role in host antiviral immunity. Given that BinCARD2 can induce MAVS oligomerization to activate the RIG-I innate immune pathway [39], we hypothesized that BinCARD1 may also play a role in RIG-I innate immune signaling. To test this hypothesis, HEK293T cells were transfected with an ISRE luciferase reporter gene and a BinCARD1 expression construct or an empty vector and were then left untreated or treated with inducers of type I IFN activity [i.e., SeV or poly (I:C)]. By measuring the luciferase activity, we found that cells with overexpressed BinCARD1 showed dramatically enhanced SeV- or poly (I:C)-induced expression of the ISRE luciferase reporter gene compared with cells that did not overexpress BinCARD1 (Fig. 6A, B). Consistent with these data, BinCARD1 knockdown in A549 cells, realized through BinCARD siRNA1 treatment, led to a reduction in IRF3 phosphorylation after SeV stimulation compared with the level in scrambled siRNA-treated cells (Supplementary Fig. 7A). In addition, HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmid expressing BinCARD1 or an empty vector and then stimulated with SeV or poly (I:C) for 6 h. A RT‒qPCR analysis showed that the expression levels of ISG15 and OAS1, two of the most upregulated type I IFN responsive genes, were much higher in the BinCARD1-overexpressing cells than in the control cells (Supplementary Fig. 7B–E). These data indicate that BinCARD1 was involved in the activation of RIG-I signaling.Fig. 6BinCARD1 activates RIG-I signaling by promoting the K63-linked ubiquitination of TRAF3. A, B An ISRE luciferase reporter assay was performed to determine the effect of BinCARD1 on the activation of RIG-I signaling. HEK293T cells were transfected with an ISRE-Luc reporter plasmid, a pRL-TK control plasmid, and a Flag-BinCARD1-expressing plasmid or an empty pCAGGS vector. At 36 h p.t., the cells were left untreated or stimulated with SeV (A) or poly (I:C) (B) for 12 h. The overexpression of BinCARD1 was confirmed by western blotting with a rabbit anti-Flag pAb. The luciferase activity of the cell lysates was analyzed with a dual-luciferase reporter assay in which firefly luciferase activity was normalized to the luciferase activity of Renilla, which had been coexpressed. The fold-change in the firefly luciferase activity of BinCARD1-overexpressing cells compared with cells transfected with empty vector is shown. ***P < 0.001. C Co-IP assays were performed to examine the interaction between BinCARD1 and RIG-I signaling pathway proteins. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing Myc-tagged BinCARD1 and Flag-tagged RIG-I, MAVS, TRAF3, TBK1, or IRF3. At 36 h p.t., cell lysate proteins were immunoprecipitated with a mouse anti-Myc mAb and subjected to western blotting with a rabbit anti-Flag pAb or a rabbit anti-Myc pAb. D HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing Flag-tagged TRAF3 and gradually increasing amounts of Myc-tagged BinCARD1. At 36 h p.t., cell lysate proteins were subjected to western blotting with a rabbit anti-Flag pAb or a rabbit anti-Myc pAb. E TRAF3 impaired the binding between BinCARD1 and IAV NP. HEK293T cells were transfected with combinations of plasmids expressing BinCARD1, V5-WSNNP, and TRAF3-Flag. At 36 h p.t., cell lysate proteins were immunoprecipitated with a mouse anti-BinCARD1 mAb, and the bound proteins were eluted and subjected to western blotting with a mouse anti-BinCARD1 mAb, a rabbit anti-Flag pAb, or a rabbit anti-NP pAb. F A co-IP assay was performed to assess TRAF3 ubiquitination. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing Flag-tagged TRAF3 (C68A/H70A) and HA-tagged ubiquitin, with or without Myc-tagged BinCARD1. At 36 h p.t., cell lysate proteins were immunoprecipitated with a mouse anti-TRAF3 mAb and then western blotted with a rabbit anti-Flag pAb or a rabbit anti-HA mAb. G A co-IP assay was performed to determine the type of TRAF3 ubiquitination linkage mediated by BinCARD1. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing Flag-tagged TRAF3 (C68A/H70A) and HA-tagged ubiquitin (K63) or ubiquitin (K63R), with or without BinCARD1. At 36 h p.t., cell lysate proteins were immunoprecipitated with a mouse anti-TRAF3 mAb and subjected to western blotting with a rabbit anti-Flag pAb or a rabbit anti-HA mAb. H K63-linked polyubiquitination of TRAF3 was induced by BinCARD1 in infected cells. RAW264.7 cells were transfected with an empty vector or a BinCARD1-expressing plasmid, and at 48 h p.t., the cells were infected with SeV. At 0 and 6 h p.i., cell lysate proteins were immunoprecipitated with a mouse anti-TRAF3 mAb and subjected to western blotting with a rabbit anti-ubiquitin (linkage-specific K63) mAb, a mouse anti-ubiquitin mAb, a mouse anti-TRAF3 mAb, or a mouse anti-BinCARD1 mAb. I A co-IP assay was performed to determine the effect of BinCARD1 on the interaction between MAVS and IKKε. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing Flag-tagged IKKε and Myc-tagged MAVS, with or without BinCARD1. At 36 h p.t., cell lysate proteins were immunoprecipitated with a mouse anti-Myc mAb and subjected to western blotting with a rabbit anti-Flag pAb or a rabbit anti-MAVS mAb. J The effect of BinCARD1 on the phosphorylation of IRF3 was assessed. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing HA-tagged TRAF3, Flag-tagged IRF3, and BinCARD1 individually or in various combinations. At 36 h p.t., cell lysate proteins were subjected to western blotting with a rabbit anti-HA mAb, a rabbit anti-Flag pAb, a rabbit anti-IRF3-p mAb, or a mouse anti-BinCARD1 mAbFull size imageTo investigate the elements of the RIG-I pathway affected by BinCARD1 function, we performed co-IP experiments with HEK293T cells to examine whether BinCARD1 associates with key adaptors in the RIG-I pathway. BinCARD1 clearly interacted with TRAF3 but not RIG-I, MAVS, TBK1, or IRF3 (Fig. 6C). We found that increasing amounts of BinCARD1 in HEK293T cells exerted no effect on the expression level of TRAF3 (Fig. 6D). Interestingly, we did not detect BinCARD1 in the lysates of cells in which Myc-tagged BinCARD1 and Flag-tagged TBK1 were coexpressed (Fig. 6C). We therefore speculated that BinCARD1 might be degraded by TBK1.Because BinCARD1 interacts with both IAV NP and TRAF3, we explored whether TRAF3 competes with NP for binding to BinCARD1. A co-IP assay showed that the amount of NP coimmunoprecipitated with BinCARD1 was dramatically reduced when TRAF3 was also expressed (Fig. 6E), indicating that the binding between NP and BinCARD1 was inhibited by the presence of TRAF3.In the RIG-I pathway, K63-linked ubiquitination of TRAF3 is required for the induction of type I IFNs [46, 47]. We therefore determined whether BinCARD1 activates TRAF3. A TRAF3 mutant deficient in E3 ubiquitin ligase activity (C68A/H70A) was assessed because this mutant is unable to mediate the ubiquitination of substrates, including itself through autoubiquitination [48]. BinCARD1-mediated polyubiquitination of TRAF3 was readily detected in HEK293T cells expressing Flag-tagged TRAF3 (C68A/H70A), HA-tagged ubiquitin, and Myc-tagged BinCARD1 (Fig. 6F). CARD domain-containing proteins can bind unanchored K63 ubiquitin chains, thereby activating target proteins [49, 50]. Therefore, to determine whether the expression of BinCARD1 leads to the K63-linked polyubiquitination of TRAF3, we cotransfected HEK293T cells with different combinations of plasmids to express Flag-tagged TRAF3 (C68A/H70A), BinCARD1, and ubiquitin mutant in which either all lysine residues except K63 were replaced with arginine residues (Ub-K63) or only the K63 residue was replaced with an arginine residue (Ub-K63R). Co-IP analyses showed that BinCARD1 promoted the ubiquitination of TRAF3 (C68A/H70A) in the presence of Ub-K63 but not Ub-K63R (Fig. 6G), indicating that BinCARD1 promoted the K63-linked ubiquitination of TRAF3. Consistent with these data, the SeV-induced K63-linked polyubiquitination of endogenous TRAF3 was clearly enhanced in BinCARD1-overexpressing RAW264.7 cells compared with control cells (Fig. 6H). We further examined the effect of BinCARD1-mediated K63-linked ubiquitination of TRAF3 on downstream signaling in the RIG-I pathway. The interaction between MAVS and IKKε was markedly increased when BinCARD1 was expressed (Fig. 6I). We also measured the phosphorylation rate of IRF3 in the absence or presence of BinCARD1 overexpression. HEK293T cells were transfected with vectors to express TRAF3 and IRF3 in the presence or absence of BinCARD1. We found that when coexpressed with BinCARD1, IRF3 was significantly phosphorylated (Fig. 6J). These results indicate that the K63-linked polyubiquitination of TRAF3, catalyzed by BinCARD1, was important for the recruitment of the TBK1-IKKε kinase complex and activation of RIG-I signaling.TBK1 mediates BinCARD1 degradation through the autophagy pathwayTBK1 is an important regulator of not only the innate immune system but also autophagy [36, 51, 52]. It has also been documented that TBK1 functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase to degrade target proteins [53]. When coexpressed with TBK1, BinCARD1 was undetectable (Fig. 6C). In addition, with increases in the abundance of exogenous TBK1-Flag, the amount of Myc-BinCARD1 gradually decreased (Fig. 7A). These results prompted us to hypothesize that BinCARD1 might be degraded by TBK1 via the ubiquitin proteasome pathway or autophagy pathway. Therefore, we used the proteasome inhibitor MG132 and the autophagy inhibitors 3-MA and Baf A1 to identify the pathway through which BinCARD1 is degraded by TBK1. We found that the degradation of BinCARD1 was abolished in the presence of 3-MA or Baf A1 but not MG132 (Fig. 7B, C, Supplementary Fig. 8), indicating that the autophagy activation was required for the degradation of BinCARD1 by TBK1. To confirm this result, we treated HEK293T cells that had been transfected with vectors to overexpress BinCARD1 with the autophagy inducers rapamycin and EBSS. We found that the addition of these autophagy inducers dramatically reduced the level of BinCARD1 (Fig. 7D), indicating that the degradation of BinCARD1 was indeed mediated by TBK1 via the autophagy system. To map the region of TBK1 involved in the degradation of BinCARD1, we generated four TBK1 truncation constructs tagged with Flag at the C-terminus and assessed their effects on the degradation of BinCARD1 in HEK293T cells. BinCARD1 was degraded in the presence of wild-type (WT) TBK1 and the truncated mutants TBK1-KD + ULD and TBK1-ULD + CC (Supplementary Fig. 9), indicating that the ULD domain in TBK1 was important for the degradation of BinCARD1.Fig. 7TBK1 mediates the degradation of BinCARD1 through the autophagy pathway. A TBK1-mediated degradation of BinCARD1 was analyzed by western blotting. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing Myc-tagged BinCARD1 and gradually increasing amounts of Flag-tagged TBK1 individually or in combination. At 36 h p.t., cell lysate proteins were subjected to western blotting with a rabbit anti-Flag pAb or a rabbit anti-Myc pAb. B, C Western blotting was performed to identify the pathway through which TBK1 degrades BinCARD1. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing BinCARD1, and at a 12-hour interval, the cells were transfected with an empty vector or a TBK1-expressing plasmid. Twenty-four hours later, the cells were treated for 8 h with H2O or 3-MA (B) and DMSO or MG132 (C). Cell lysate proteins were subjected to western blotting with a mouse anti-BinCARD1 mAb or a rabbit anti-TBK1 mAb. D The effect of autophagy inducers on the level of BinCARD1 was assessed. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing BinCARD1. At 24 h p.t., cells were treated with rapamycin for 24 h or EBSS for 2 h. Cell lysate proteins were subjected to western blotting with a mouse anti-BinCARD1 mAbFull size imageTBK1 promotes the autophagic degradation of BinCARD1 by activating p62 phosphorylationTBK1 can regulate autophagy by phosphorylating the autophagy receptors OPTN and p62 [54, 55]. We first asked whether BinCARD1 associates with OPTN or p62. Co-IP experiments in HEK293T cells showed that BinCARD1 did not interact with OPTN (Fig. 8A) but clearly interacted with p62 (Fig. 8B, C). Since ubiquitination is necessary for autophagic degradation of target proteins, we next examined whether overexpressed BinCARD1 is modified by endogenous ubiquitin chains. GST pull-down and western blot assays showed that BinCARD1 undergoes ubiquitination at the C-terminal 101–228 region but not the N-terminal 1–100 region (Fig. 8D). To identify the type of BinCARD1 polyubiquitination linkage, we expressed GST-BinCARD1 101–228 in HEK293T cells, together with HA-tagged WT ubiquitin (WT Ub) or Ub mutants in which all but one internal lysine residues were mutated. Coexpression of either WT Ub or the Ub-K63 mutant led to efficient BinCARD1 polyubiquitination, whereas coexpression of other Ub mutants did not exert this effect (Fig. 8E), indicating that BinCARD1 was ubiquitinated via the K63 linkage. There is only one lysine residue, located at position 103, within the 101–228 region of BinCARD1. By generating a GST-BinCARD1 101–228 mutant bearing a K103R mutation, we found that the K63-linked ubiquitination of BinCARD1 101–228 was abolished (Fig. 8F), confirming that the ubiquitination of BinCARD1 occurred at the K103 residue. Furthermore, HEK293T cells were cotransfected to express the GST-tagged BinCARD1 K103R mutant and Flag-tagged TBK1. We found that the amount of GST-tagged BinCARD1 K103R mutant remained stable in the presence of gradually increasing amounts of coexpressed Flag-tagged TBK1 (Fig. 8G). These results demonstrate that the ubiquitination of BinCARD1 was required for its autophagic degradation mediated by TBK1.Fig. 8TBK1 promotes the autophagic degradation of BinCARD1 by activating p62 phosphorylation. A A co-IP assay was performed to examine the interaction between BinCARD1 and OPTN. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing Flag-tagged BinCARD1 and Myc-tagged OPTN individually or in combination. At 36 h p.t., cell lysate proteins were immunoprecipitated with a mouse anti-Myc mAb and subjected to western blotting with a rabbit anti-Myc pAb or a rabbit anti-Flag pAb. B, C A co-IP assay was performed to examine the interaction between BinCARD1 and p62. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing Flag-tagged BinCARD1 and Myc-tagged p62 individually or in combination. At 36 h p.t., cell lysate proteins were immunoprecipitated with a mouse anti-Flag mAb (B) or a mouse anti-Myc mAb (C) and subjected to western blotting with a rabbit anti-Flag pAb or a rabbit anti-Myc pAb. D GST pull-down assays were performed to examine the endogenous ubiquitination of full-length and truncation mutants of BinCARD1. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing GST-tagged BinCARD1, BinCARD1 1–100, or BinCARD1 101–228. Thirty-six hours later, cell lysate proteins were pulled down with glutathione magnetic beads, and the bound proteins were eluted and subjected to western blotting with a mouse anti-ubiquitin mAb or a rabbit anti-GST pAb to determine the presence of endogenous ubiquitin and BinCARD1, respectively. E A GST pull-down assay was performed to examine the type of ubiquitination linkage on BinCARD1 101–228. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing the GST-tagged BinCARD1 101–228 mutant and HA-tagged WT ubiquitin or the indicated ubiquitin mutants. At 36 h p.t., cell lysate proteins were pulled down with glutathione magnetic beads, and the bound proteins were eluted and subjected to western blotting with a rabbit anti-HA mAb or a rabbit anti-GST pAb. F The ubiquitination of the K103R mutant of BinCARD1 101–228 in cells expressing ubiquitin mutants was analyzed. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing WT or the K103R mutant of GST-tagged BinCARD1 101–228 and HA-tagged ubiquitin (K63) or ubiquitin (K63R). At 36 h p.t., cell lysate proteins were pulled down with glutathione magnetic beads, and the bound proteins were eluted and subjected to western blotting with a rabbit anti-HA mAb or a rabbit anti-GST pAb. G The effect of TBK1 on the stability of the BinCARD1 K103R ubiquitination mutant was evaluated. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing the GST-tagged BinCARD1 K103R mutant and gradually increasing amounts of Flag-tagged TBK1 individually or in combination. At 36 h p.t., cell lysates were subjected to western blotting with a rabbit anti-Flag pAb or a mouse anti-GST mAb. H Confocal microscopy was performed to visualize the formation of cytoplasmic p62 puncta. A549 cells were transfected with Flag-BinCARD1-expressing plasmids or an empty pCAGGS vector, and at 24 h p.t., the cells were treated with the autophagy inhibitor 3-MA for 8 h. The cells were fixed and stained with a rabbit anti-Flag pAb and a mouse anti-p62 mAb and then incubated with Alexa Fluor 633 goat anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) (red) and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L) (green). The nuclei were stained with DAPI. I The TBK1-p62 axis mediated the autophagic degradation of BinCARD1. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing Flag-tagged TBK1, Myc-tagged p62, and BinCARD1 individually or in combination. At 36 h p.t., cell lysates were subjected to western blotting with a rabbit anti-TBK1 mAb, a mouse anti-p62 mAb, a rabbit anti-phospho-SQSTM1/p62 (Ser403) mAb, a mouse anti-BinCARD1 mAb, or a rabbit anti-LC3B pAbFull size imagePrevious studies have shown that TBK1 can phosphorylate the S403 site of p62 to activate p62 and induce p62 binding to target proteins, thereby promoting autophagy [35]. We reasoned that BinCARD1 is also likely degraded through this pathway. To test this idea, A549 cells were transfected with a Flag-BinCARD1-expressing plasmid or an empty pCAGGS vector. At 24 h p.t., the cells were treated with the autophagy inhibitor 3-MA for 8 h. A confocal microscopy analysis showed that in the presence of 3-MA, more endogenous p62 puncta were observed in the cytoplasm of the BinCARD1-overexpressing A549 cells than in the control cells (Fig. 8H), indicating that p62 played an important role in the active autophagic degradation of BinCARD1. To further validate the importance of the TBK1-p62 axis in the autophagic degradation of BinCARD1, HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing Flag-tagged TBK1, Myc-tagged p62, and BinCARD1 individually or in combination. At 36 h p.t., cell lysates were subjected to western blotting. We found that endogenous phosphorylation of p62 at site 403 was detectable when TBK1 was overexpressed. Notably, in comparison to cells coexpressing only p62 and BinCARD1, coexpression of TBK1, p62, and BinCARD1 led to a dramatic increase in phosphorylation of p62, induction of LC-3II, a marker of autophagy initiation, and degradation of BinCARD1 (Fig. 8I). These results demonstrate that TBK1-mediated phosphorylation of p62 promoted the autophagic degradation of BinCARD1.DiscussionDuring the life cycle of IAV, after viral fusion and uncoating, the vRNP complex is released into the cytoplasm, and the active cellular transport machinery delivers the vRNP complex to the nucleus [5]. Within the nucleus, the primary transcription catalyzed by the vRNP complex leads to the generation of mRNA, which is exported to ribosomes, where progeny viral proteins, including PB2, PB1, PA, and NP, are synthesized. These newly synthesized vRNP complex proteins re-enter the nucleus, either as monomers, in the cases of PB2 and NP, or as PB1-PA dimers, to complete the transcription and replication of the viral genome [56, 57]. During the nuclear import of the vRNP complex and newly synthesized NP, IMP α isoforms recognize the NLSs of NP and recruit IMP β to facilitate NP and vRNP complex crossing the nuclear pore complex for translocation into the nucleus of infected cells [11, 13]. Hence, any host factor that affects the interaction of NP with the classical nuclear import pathway influences the nuclear import of the vRNP complex and NP and, ultimately, the replication of IAV. To date, several host proteins have been reported to facilitate or interfere with the interaction between NP and the classical nuclear import pathway. For example, PLSCR1 forms a trimeric complex with NP and IMP α, blocking the recruitment of IMP β [20]; MOV10 inhibits the association between NP and IMP α [17]; and eEF1D interferes with the interaction between NP and IMP α5 [22]. In contrast, Hsp40/DnaJB1 promotes the binding of NP to IMP α [21]. In the present study, we identified BinCARD1 as an important host factor in the replication of IAV. Knocking down or knocking out BinCARD1 expression decreased the replication of IAV, whereas overexpression of BinCARD1 promoted viral growth. In contrast to host factors that function in the steps of internalization or uncoating (e.g., FFAR2, IGDCC4, HDAC6, and EPS8) [45, 58,59,60], BinCARD1 does not appear to affect these early steps of IAV entry. Instead, we found that downregulation of BinCARD1 expression suppressed the nuclear import of the vRNP complex and NP, whereas overexpression of BinCARD1 exerted an enhancing effect. Consistent with these data, the expression of BinCARD1 was found to be important for the vRNP complex activity of IAV. Mechanistically, BinCARD1 interacts with both NP and IMP α7 and facilitates the complex formation between NP and IMP α7, thereby promoting the nuclear import of the vRNP complex and NP.The innate immune system is the first line of host defense against infection, which is essential for the initial detection and recognition of invading pathogens, activation of acute antimicrobial responses, and subsequent activation of adaptive immunity. When pathogens invade a host, pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) specifically recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). A number of PRRs have been identified, and their functions have been extensively studied; well-characterized PRRs include the cytoplasmic viral sensor RIG-I [24, 41]. During IAV infection, RIG-I senses 5’-ppp in the termini of viral RNAs, leading to the activation of innate immune signaling cascades and the secretion of type I IFNs. TRAF3 is an important adaptor in the RIG-I signaling pathway [61]. During viral infection, K63-linked polyubiquitination of TRAF3 recruits TBK1-IKKε, and IRF3 is then activated to trigger type I IFN production [30, 62]. Recently, it has been revealed that the CARD domain plays a role not only in CARD-CARD interactions but also in ubiquitination, in which unanchored free K63-linked ubiquitin chains bind to CARD and regulate CARD protein activation [49, 50]. K63-linked polyubiquitin chains play an important role in protein complex assembly and function [63, 64]. In this study, we found that the interaction between BinCARD1 and TRAF3 led to K63-linked polyubiquitination and activation of TRAF3, followed by the recruitment of downstream TBK1-IKKε and phosphorylation of IRF3, thereby promoting the activation of the RIG-I signaling pathway.TBK1 is a ubiquitous member of the IKK family [65]. It was initially identified as a kinase critical for the expression of type I IFNs and is considered a master regulator of innate immunity signaling pathways [32, 66,67,68,69]. Increasing evidence suggests that, in addition to being involved in innate immunity, TBK1 is involved in autophagy [36, 70]. In the present study, we found that TBK1 degraded BinCARD1 when both proteins were exogenously coexpressed. Using autophagy inhibitors or inducers, we found that the TBK1-mediated degradation of BinCARD1 was dependent on the autophagy pathway. TBK1 induced autophagy by phosphorylating autophagy receptors, namely, p62 and OPTN [36, 70]. Activated autophagy receptors bind to proteins that subsequently undergo ubiquitination and interact with the autophagosomal protein LC3, which delivers the ubiquitinated proteins to an autophagosome for degradation, thus completing the process of autophagy [35, 71, 72]. We found that BinCARD1 interacted with p62 but not OPTN, indicating that the autophagic degradation of BinCARD1 was mediated by p62. In contrast to K48-linked polyubiquitin chains, which are canonical signals on substrate proteins that target them for proteasomal degradation, K63-ubiquitinated proteins are degraded in lysosomes through the selective autophagy pathway [73]. We confirmed that BinCARD1 was polyubiquitinated at position 103 via the K63 linkage, which led to the autophagic degradation of BinCARD1, and further revealed that the BinCARD1 K103R mutant remained stable when coexpressed with TBK1. Acting as a key adaptor in the autophagic clearance of polyubiquitinated proteins, p62 is activated when phosphorylated by TBK1. We found that the coexpression of TBK1, p62, and BinCARD1 led to a dramatic increase in p62 phosphorylation, LC3II induction and BinCARD1 degradation, thereby confirming that the degradation of BinCARD1 was mediated via the TBK1-p62 axis. These results highlight the complexity of the host cellular network in the regulation of IAV infection: the promoting role played by BinCARD1 in the nuclear import of the vRNP complex and replication of IAV was negatively regulated by selective autophagic degradation of BinCARD1 via the TBK1-p62 axis.In summary, our study revealed that IAV engages BinCARD1, which is a positive regulatory host factor, to realize efficient viral replication. Mechanistically, BinCARD1 interacts with viral NP and enhances the interaction between NP and IMP α7, thereby facilitating the nuclear import of the vRNP complex and newly synthesized NP. However, the IAV leverage of BinCARD1 for its own replication induces an antagonistic response by the host: the interaction between BinCARD1 and TRAF3 favors the activation of the RIG-I innate immune signaling pathway, and polyubiquitinated BinCARD1 is then subjected to selective autophagic degradation via the TBK1-p62 axis (Fig. 9). Our data thus highlight the complexity of host cellular networks in the regulation of the IAV replication cycle.Fig. 9Schematic model showing the role of BinCARD1 in the replication cycle of IAV. BinCARD1 interacts with IAV NP and enhances the interaction between NP and IMP α7, thereby facilitating the nuclear import of the vRNP complex and newly synthesized NP. In contrast, the role played by BinCARD1 in promoting IAV replication is counteracted by the host defense system: BinCARD1-mediated Lys63-linked polyubiquitination of TRAF3 favors the activation of the RIG-I innate immune signaling pathway, and polyubiquitinated BinCARD1 is subjected to selective autophagic degradation via the TBK1-p62 axisFull size image Data availability All data needed to evaluate the conclusions in this study are presented in this manuscript or the Supplementary Information.

Additional information can be found at www.clevelandclinic.org/fluPatients can schedule an appointment by phone or online via MyChart. Patients can also receive the flu vaccine at most scheduled in-person office visits with a physician, nurse practitioner or physician assistant starting Sept. 1. In addition, patients can call their primary care physician’s office to schedule a nurse flu vaccination appointment.“Every year thousands of people are hospitalized as a result of the flu. It is a highly contagious respiratory infection that should not be taken lightly,” said Steven Gordon, M.D., chair of the Department of Infectious Disease at Cleveland Clinic.“Getting vaccinated each year is the best way to prevent the spread of influenza, and is the best way to keep ourselves and our communities healthy during flu season. The past two flu seasons have seen lighter influenza activity, but with the rolling back of pandemic precautions such as masking, it’s likely that this flu season may be more severe.”As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, it’s even more important to receive the flu vaccine to reduce your risk of the flu and to avoid a surge in hospitalizations. Influenza and COVID-19 can have similar symptoms, and in many cases, it may not be possible to tell the difference without being tested. Receiving yearly vaccination provides the best protection against the flu throughout the season.Cleveland Clinic will still be offering the COVID-19 vaccine for people ages 5 years and older at Hillcrest Hospital and Fairview Hospital vaccination centers. Beginning Sept. 3, when patients present for their COVID-19 vaccination, they will also have the option to receive a flu vaccination. It is safe to be vaccinated for flu and COVID-19 at the same time. COVID-19 vaccinations are also offered at many scheduled primary care and specialty appointments.Infectious disease experts recommend everyone 6 months and older get vaccinated for the flu every year.The flu is contagious and can cause serious respiratory infection. The timing of seasonal flu activity is unpredictable and can vary, but most typically occurs between October and May and usually peaks between December and February. Hospitals are preparing for a heavier and earlier flu season this year.Vaccination is especially important for people at high risk for developing flu complications, such as adults age 65 and older, pregnant women, people with chronic medical conditions, and children younger than 5.The same precautions that protect against COVID-19 also will help protect from the flu – proper hand hygiene, social distancing, staying home when sick and wearing masks. In addition, there are prescription antiviral medications that can be used to treat influenza illness.Symptoms of the flu include fever, dry cough, headache, sore throat, chills, muscle aches, tiredness and loss of appetite.Click here for interactive tools and to learn more about the flu and its impact.About Cleveland ClinicCleveland Clinic is a nonprofit multispecialty academic medical center that integrates clinical and hospital care with research and education.

(UGA file photo) Pathogens can be transmitted between the two and can even transfer to humans Wild birds come into contact with backyard chicken flocks more frequently than people realize, creating a pathway for pathogens to transmit back and forth, according to new research from the University of Georgia. Such pathways increase the risk for spillover events that can threaten the health of all these groups—wild birds, backyard chickens and the people who care for them. “Most people probably don’t realize how frequently wild birds come in and take advantage of the food and water that’s put out for chickens,” said Sonia Hernandez, professor of wildlife disease at the Warnell School of Forestry and Natural Resources and the College of Veterinary Medicine. “Wild birds learn that resource, and those contact points can become places where pathogens like Newcastle disease virus and avian influenza virus can be transmitted back and forth.” For the study, published in Epidemiology and Infection, Hernandez and a team including first author Andrea Ayala conducted a supplemental feeding experiment followed by observations at three sites with backyard chickens in north Georgia. At each site, they identified the species of wild birds that shared habitat with the chickens, were detected more frequently, and entered the coops. The team identified 14 wild bird species that entered the coop to consume supplemental feed and were considered high risk for pathogen transmission. “Interestingly, seasonality played a role—but not the one that we expected,” said Ayala, a postdoctoral researcher at Yale University who earned a Ph.D. in comparative biomedical sciences at UGA. “We had hypothesized that feeding rates would be highest in winter, but for some species such as blue jays, the opposite was detected.” Over 60 hours of observation, 1,574 individual wild birds were detected across the three sites, comprising 72 species from 24 families. Tufted titmice (15.6%), northern cardinals (13.2%), Carolina chickadees (7%) and Carolina wrens (6%) were the four most commonly detected species. Tufted titmice and northern cardinals had the highest contact rates with backyard chickens. There were some surprises in terms of species, according to Hernandez. The sites attracted species that were seed eaters and grain eaters, and also some insectivores. “The northern cardinals are ubiquitous seed eaters, so we expected them to be frequent, but that’s not the case for the tufted titmouse or the Carolina wren,” she said. “They will eat bird food, but they’re also insectivores and were likely attracted to insects that were attracted to the food.” (UGA file photo) The presence of food presents an ecological opportunity that may attract birds who wouldn’t necessarily come down to the ground, said Hernandez. In the forest, some birds are at the very top of the canopy, some are in the middle, some are in the understory, and some are on the ground. “Offering supplemental food blurs those lines, because birds are more willing to cross those lines for a resource that’s provided artificially,” she said. The best way to prevent contact between backyard chickens and wild birds is to offer food in a place that’s secure—in the coop behind mesh where chickens can access it, but wild birds can’t. “Offering food in the coop saves the owner money, keeps the food from being exposed to rain and other elements, and minimizes the amount of waste in the area,” Hernandez said. “If chickens are allowed to free range, don’t offer them food during that time. A songbird has no reason to come down near a chicken unless there’s a food source.” Potential dangers of pathogen crossover Songbirds and other wildlife are extremely vulnerable to the introduction of pathogens from domestic animals, Hernandez said. Newcastle disease virus and avian influenza virus circulate in backyard chickens, but there are other pathogens that can also circulate. “Salmonella is something that kills songbirds every year, and mycoplasma makes songbirds sick,” she said. “Wild birds in North America are currently experiencing an avian influenza outbreak that’s severely impacting species like bald eagles, vultures and waterfowl. Some of those species have needed very careful management to return them to viable populations because they were at the brink of extinction not that long ago. Yet avian influenza threatens to undo all that effort, planning and careful monitoring. By studying how pathogens move among domestic and wild birds, we can better understand how to manage and prevent problems in the future.” The study’s results confirmed that pathogen transmission is bidirectional, according to Ayala. Wild birds can spread disease to backyard chickens, and backyard chickens can spread disease to wild birds. Add in the humans that care for the chickens, and there’s opportunity for disease to spread into—or out of—that group as well. “Families with children would be susceptible if they’re handling chickens that are shedding salmonella, since children are less likely to have good hygiene,” she said. Last year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported an outbreak of salmonella typhimurium, which causes disease in people but also kills songbirds. “What was unusual about that outbreak is that a high percentage of people reported contact with either wild birds or bird feeders,” said Hernandez, who is working with the CDC on this topic. “This paper is yet another piece of that puzzle. Sometimes people get sick and don’t know where it comes from,” she said. “It’s possible that it comes from handling the dishes, the feeders or the waterers, either from the chickens or from the wild birds.” Although pathogen crossover can have serious consequences, Hernandez wants to promote awareness—and responsible practices—rather than fear. “We live in an era in which the boundaries between human health and wild animal health are very tenuous because we’ve created circumstances that allow for crossover,” she said. “We want people to be aware that all the things that impact the environment and impact the health of animals—pollution, contaminants and pathogens—also affect our health. We are not separated from our environments.” For people who like to feed birds, Hernandez suggests that instead of providing food, it’s better to create a backyard habitat that allows wild birds to feed themselves. “Given an opportunity to forage for natural food, songbirds will do better with that,” she said.

By Yael L. Maxwell Created with Sketch. August 31, 2022 Randomizing a large population of adults to receive either a high- or standard -dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine is feasible, and while the DANFLU-1 trial was not powered for clinical endpoints, it hinted at reduced hospitalization for influenza or pneumonia and all-cause mortality with the higher dose. The design of the “pragmatic randomized trial [using] existing infrastructure for recruitment, inclusion, randomization, and vaccination and relying solely on registry-based data collection” can now be applied to “future fully powered vaccine trials as well as to trials investigating other interventions,” said Niklas Dyrby Johansen, MD (Herlev and Gentofte Hospital, Denmark), who presented the DANFLU-1 findings Saturday at the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Congress 2022. Senior investigator Tor Biering-Sørensen, MD, PhD, MPH (Herlev and Gentofte Hospital), told journalists at an ESC press conference that his team is “definitely” planning to conduct the fully powered randomized trial, which will need 208,000 participants to properly assess both hospitalizations for pneumonia or flu and also cardiovascular outcomes. The findings come on the heels of both the IVVE trial presented at the American College of Cardiology 2022 Scientific Session, demonstrating a reduction in MACE during flu season, and a meta-analysis published in JAMA Network Open in May, showing the flu vaccine can reduce major cardiovascular events by as much as one-third compared with placebo. Also, the INVESTED trial in 2020 showed no added benefit but also no harm with the high-dose flu vaccine among patients with a recent MI or heart failure hospitalization, compared with a standard-dose vaccine. Feasibility Achieved For the study, Johansen and colleagues used Danish nationwide administrative health registry data to randomize 12,551 adults ages 65 to 79 years (mean age 72 years; 47% female) to receive either standard or high-dose influenza vaccines during the 2021-2022 flu season. While the investigators initially planned to include at least 40,000 participants, regulatory approvals were delayed, thus limiting the number of participants that could be recruited and enrolled. Still, they managed to enroll 11,463 within the first 15 days. Over 6 months of follow-up, the relative vaccine effectiveness (rVE) seemed to be higher for the high versus standard vaccine dose. The incidence of hospitalization for pneumonia or flu was lower for those who received the more-potent vaccine (10 vs 28 events; rVE 64.4%; 95% CI 24.4%-84.6%). Similar trends were observed for hospitalization for respiratory disease (24 vs 40 events; rVE 40.1%; 95% CI -1.8%-65.5%) and cardiorespiratory disease (103 vs 117 events; rVE 12.1%; 95% CI -15.5%-33.3%) but not for cardiovascular disease (81 vs 82 events; rVE -1.0%; 95% CI -39.1%-26.6%) or any hospitalization (513 vs 550 events; rVE 6.9%; 95% CI -5.2%-17.6%). Researchers did, however, find significantly fewer all-cause deaths among those who received the high-dose vaccine (21 vs 41 events; rVE 48.9%; 95% CI 11.5%-71.3%). Everything we've learned in the pandemic is that it turns out vaccines and science still matter. And that they can still help you and your family. Jacob Udell There were also no differences observed between the study groups in terms cardiovascular death or hospitalization for MI, atrial fibrillation, stroke, or heart failure. Cardiovascular serious adverse events were less frequent in the high-dose group (1.0% vs 1.4%; P = 0.047), with no other significant differences in adverse events observed. The presenters stressed that the study was not powered to detect clinical outcomes. “Whether I would choose the high dose for my own patients, . . . to prevent the flu, yes, I would recommend the high-dose vaccine,” Biering-Sørensen said. “But not to prevent hospitalizations. These data are only hypothesis-generating. . . . We only tested the system. We tested whether we could do this.” High-Dose Vaccines ‘Safe’ Discussing the study in the main session, Ole Fröbert, MD, PhD (Örebro University, Sweden), said the fact that DANFLU-1 was an all-comers trial means “we can generalize from the findings and, most importantly, we know now that it's safe to give high-dose vaccines.” While the trialists didn’t enroll their intended 40,000 participants, Fröbert said a feasibility trial of 12,000 patients is “quite unheard of and impressive.” The fact that it was open label was “probably a minor issue in a trial with a single influenza vaccination,” he continued, adding that influenza vaccine effectiveness varies from season to season. The fact that the trial was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic was both a strength and a limitation, Fröbert said. “It's impressive that the investigators were able to conduct a trial during COVID-19, but it probably meant that there was less influenza around and it could have affected the number of endpoints.” To put the results in perspective with the INVESTED data, he said both trials “demonstrated that high-dose vaccine is safe.” As for whether or not it can reduce all-cause death, which the INVESTED trial did not show, Fröbert said “perhaps there's little to gain from a high-dose influenza vaccine if you're already receiving guideline-directed medical therapy for your disease.” At this point, “the role of high-dose influenza vaccine in cardiovascular disease is still unresolved but it's likely the best choice for 65-year-plus citizens,” he said. “We need more studies and we also need cost-benefit calculations.” Fröbert also called for an upgrade from a 1B to a 1A recommendation for influenza vaccination in cardiovascular disease as well as for it to be standard of care to provide influenza vaccines at hospital discharge for cardiovascular disease. “It's time that we as cardiologists take responsibility,” he said. Confronting the Naysayers Commenting on the results for TCTMD, Jacob Udell, MD, MPH (University of Toronto, Canada), who served as co-principal investigator of the INVESTED study, also said he was amazed by how many participants the researchers were able to enroll so quicky. Even though DANFLU-1 was a feasibility study, he said “it’s still important that we demonstrated, particularly for all the naysayers out there, that a high-dose flu shot here compared to a standard flu shot . . . actually reduced influenza or pneumonia in this at-risk patient population.” Even though he cautioned against overinterpreting the results, a risk reduction of about 30% is “huge,” Udell added, because many people still don’t believe that flu shots work. He recommended using the high-dose vaccine, if available, in all people over the age of 65 years with comorbidities, viewing it like a vaccine plus booster all in one. “Do I think it could work in younger patients? Absolutely,” Udell said. “It's like the question of using high-dose statins in younger primary prevention versus secondary prevention [patients], in that some people may not need that intensive dose at a more primordial stage of risk. Sometimes you might see some more local side effects that might discourage its use in that population, and so there's that balancing act of when and where to use the high dose. It's not yet approved for use in all-comers; it's provocative to ask the question whether it could be.” Udell said he looks forward to seeing the results of the fully-powered DANFLU-2 study as well as other similar ones that might be conducted in other parts of the world. “Everything we've learned in the pandemic is that it turns out vaccines and science still matter,” he said. “And that they can still help you and your family. And that it is something that strongly should be pursued.” by Yael L. Maxwell Editor, Fellows Forum Yael L. Maxwell is Senior Medical Journalist for TCTMD and Section Editor of TCTMD's Fellows Forum.

The ‘Mitigation Strategy for Avian Influenza in Wild Birds in England and Wales’ sets out how these groups, together with the government and its delivery partners, can mitigate the impact of avian influenza on wild bird populations whilst protecting public health, the wider environment and the rural economy. The new guidance advises land managers on how to make natural areas safe for the public, for example by adding signage warning visitors of the risk of avian influenza and what they can do to protect themselves, and having contingency plans in place to allow them to quickly respond to outbreaks. The guidance sets out the government’s approach to monitoring the spread of avian influenza in wild bird populations and better understanding how the disease is distributed geographically and in which species of birds, with international best practice and the latest scientific and ornithological evidence underpinning this. It is also consistent with the government’s Notifiable avian disease control strategy for Great Britain. The Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) has been operating a year-round surveillance programme across Great Britain in found dead wild birds, which allows our world-leading researchers to better understand the latest strain and how it is spreading. During the current outbreak, over 1,500 wild birds have returned positive results from over 360 locations and 61 different species. An eight-strong research consortium was launched by APHA and received £1.5 million in funding to develop new strategies to tackle outbreak of avian influenza. Its world-leading researchers will help build our understanding in several key areas, including why the current virus strains have formed larger and longer outbreaks and understanding transmission and infection in different bird populations. Defra Biosecurity Minister Lord Benyon said: Our wild birds are facing exceptional pressures from avian flu this year and we have seen the tragic effect it has had – particularly on our seabird colonies. I very much share concerns about the impact avian influenza is likely to have on breeding populations of wild birds in the future, particularly those that nest in large numbers and represent some of our rarer and much loved species. We are funding a world leading science programme to try and better understand how avian influenza is spreading in wild birds and today’s guidance will help land managers, ornithologists and the public manage some of the issues we are facing. We will continue to work closely with partners to consider any further action we can take. Welsh Government’s Minister for Climate Change Julie James said: Fortunately, Wales’ wild bird populations have so far escaped the mass mortalities seen in Scotland and England, but we remain extremely vigilant to the dangers of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI). As well as working with Defra and our partners to create the cross-border Mitigation Strategy for Avian Influenza in Wild Birds in England and Wales, which is published today, we have suspended all seabird ringing and nest recording in Wales in response to confirmed cases of HPAI on Anglesey and in Ceredigion and on neighbouring Grassholm Island. Wales is home to the world’s largest colony of Manx shearwaters, the third largest gannet colony, as well as large colonies of other seabirds, such as auks, gulls and terns. We will continue to closely monitor the ongoing situation and urge anyone who sees a dead bird to report it and not to touch it. This year’s avian influenza outbreak has been the largest and longest ever on record in the UK and in many parts of Europe, with infections continuing beyond the normal winter period and now hitting wild birds and breeding colonies of seabirds that are not typically affected. Large mortalities of rare seabirds, from suspected avian influenza, have been reported at iconic sites such as Farne Islands, which is home to guillemots, puffins, and Arctic tern, and Coquet Island where the UK’s only breeding population of Roseate tern resides. The UK’s seabirds are an important part of our natural heritage, and their protection is a high priority for the Government, with long-term population monitoring being crucial to understanding the impact of a range of factors on our internationally significant populations of breeding seabirds. We have already built a comprehensive network of Marine Protected Areas, which include sites to protect seabirds, and our recently published Marine Wildlife Bycatch Mitigation Initiative will identify actions that can tackle one of the most significant threats facing our seabirds. In addition to the existing Seabird Monitoring Programme, Natural England and Natural Resources Wales have set up seabird reporting systems to collect key data on bird mortality at breeding sites and have been commissioned by Defra and the Welsh Government to assess the vulnerability of seabird species in light of the pressures they are facing. These projects will help inform future species recovery plans and identify specific actions that can be taken to support population growth. Defra and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee will also work with key experts to assess how conservation actions and monitoring can be improved to help populations recover. This work will continue over the coming months to react to future incidents of avian influenza in wild birds and assess whether any further action should be taken to protect these important species. The guidance also reasserts our approach for removing and disposing of dead wild birds. We do not recommend wild bird carcasses are removed, except in specific circumstances as set out in the Strategy. This is due to the limited evidence indicating their removal reduces the risk of transmission between birds, as the natural environment is already heavily contaminated with the virus. If removal is needed, it is the responsibility of the landowner, or local authorities in the case of public areas, to safely arrange disposal and to cover any costs associated, including disposal in compliance with relevant animal-by-products rules.

Parkinson's DiseaseParkinson’s Disease and the Flu Shot: Advice From an ExpertIf you have Parkinson’s disease, don’t miss this important part of preventive care.ByBrian P. DunleavyMedically ReviewedbyJason Paul Chua, MD, PhDPublished on August 29, 2022Getting an annual flu shot protects you against the flu, its complications, and worsened Parkinson’s symptoms.Getty ImagesThe annual flu shot helps protect against severe illness from the flu — and this is particularly important for people with neurological disorders such as Parkinson’s disease (PD).That’s because people with these disorders may be at higher risk of contracting the flu and experiencing severe health complications as a result, according to the CDC.However, many people are concerned about the safety and effectiveness of the flu vaccine. So is the flu shot, which is commonly available at primary care doctors’ offices and pharmacies, safe for people with PD? And will it work?“The short answer is yes, full stop,” says Jori Fleisher, MD, an associate professor of neurological sciences at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago. “Unfortunately, if people with a neurologic condition aren’t explicitly told to get the vaccine, they often don’t. And that’s the wrong message. Just because someone has PD, that doesn’t mean they shouldn’t get other age-appropriate preventive care that they need.”Dr. Fleisher uses the example of breast cancer. “A woman with Parkinson’s would still get a mammogram,” she explains.What is the Best Month to Get a Flu Shot?Most people get their flu shots in September, October, and November, but it’s never too late to protect yourself from the flu, according to Purvi S. Parikh, MD, of NYU Langone Health.Next up video playing in 10 secondsPeople With Parkinson’s at High Risk for Flu ComplicationsAll adults age 50 and older should get a flu shot annually because they’re more likely than younger people to experience complications from the flu such as pneumonia or bronchitis, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).When people with neurological conditions such as Parkinson’s get the flu, not only do they experience typical symptoms — cough, fever, and fatigue, for example — but they may also see their tremor, slowness, stiffness, and other Parkinson’s symptoms temporarily worsen, Fleisher says.In addition, flu-related illness such as pneumonia can be more severe and longer-lasting in people with PD or worsen symptoms related to walking and balance, swallowing, rigidity, and tremor, she adds. Historically, studies have suggested that people with Parkinson’s who develop pneumonia are at high risk of death.Not surprisingly, people with Parkinson’s are included on the CDC's list of those at high risk for the flu and are advised to get vaccinated early, ideally by the end of October each year.Moreover, there are no specific restrictions against getting the flu shot for people with Parkinson’s, according to the Parkinson’s Foundation, and none of the prescription medications currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of PD carry any specific warnings regarding the flu vaccine, Fleisher notes.As a result, the foundation recommends that everyone with Parkinson’s get the flu shot annually.Types of Flu Vaccine Flu, or influenza, vaccines are designed to cause antibodies against the virus to develop in your body within about two weeks of receiving the shot, according to the CDC. Antibodies are proteins created by your immune system that provide protection against infection with the viruses that are used to make vaccine, which varies from year to year based on what research suggests will be the most common during the winter season, the agency says.Although the effectiveness of the seasonal flu vaccine fluctuates depending on what strains of the virus circulate, it typically prevents severe illness about 40 to 60 percent of the time, based on CDC data.There are several flu vaccines used in the United States. They include:Unadjuvanted Quadrivalent Vaccines These vaccines, which are administered via shots or injections, are made using flu virus cells grown in eggs. Examples include: Afluria Quadrivalent, Fluarix Quadrivalent, FluLaval Quadrivalent, and Fluzone Quadrivalent. They’re designed to protect against four different flu viruses projected to be in circulation during a flu season. There are no precautions or warnings with these vaccines for people with Parkinson’s; however, if you’re allergic to eggs or sulfur, you should use a different vaccine, the CDC advises.Quadrivalent Cell-Based Vaccines These vaccines, which are also administered via shots or injections, are made from flu virus cells grown in cell cultures, so they’re egg-free. Flucelvax Quadrivalent is an example of this type of vaccine.Both of these vaccines are made from weakened influenza viruses. In the United States, live-attenuated flu vaccines are also available in a nasal spray, according to the CDC.Recombinant Quadrivalent Vaccines These vaccines are the option most often called the “flu shot,” the CDC says. They aren’t made using candidate vaccine virus samples. Instead, they’re made synthetically, based on the DNA of naturally occurring flu viruses. They may be made in egg-based manufacturing processes, or using cell-based approaches, according to the CDC.Adjuvanted Quadrivalent Vaccines These vaccines, which are also given as shots or injections, are designed for people age 65 and older — the age group commonly associated with Parkinson’s — because they feature an ingredient designed to create a stronger immune response, according to the CDC. Older adults are known to have weaker immune systems, which makes it more difficult for them to fight off infections. These vaccines are egg-free.Quadrivalent High-Dose Vaccines This vaccine, sold as Fluzone High-Dose, contains a higher dose of antigen (the ingredient designed to stimulate antibody response) to help create a stronger immune reaction in adults age 65 and older, the CDC says.Live Attenuated Vaccines This vaccine, sold as FluMist Quadrivalent, is given intranasally with a nasal sprayer, instead of with a needle like other flu shots. It’s approved for people ages 2 to 49. Because they use live flu virus cells, live attenuated vaccines shouldn’t be given to people who are pregnant or have weakened immune systems due to other health conditions.The Davis-Phinney Foundation for Parkinson’s notes that only needle injection flu vaccines are recommended for people with the disorder. This means, if you have PD, you shouldn’t get a nasal spray vaccine.Vaccine Side EffectsAll of these vaccines have been linked with side effects, primarily injection-site reactions in the case of the shots. In addition, some people may develop flu-like symptoms for a short time after receiving the vaccine, but they will be much milder than a typical illness caused by the virus, according to Fleisher.“People may experience these symptoms for a little while, but it just means that their immune system is responding to the vaccine,” she said. “Unfortunately, anytime someone with PD is feeling under the weather, even if it’s a reaction to a vaccine, it can worsen their PD symptoms temporarily. Still, it’s always better to get the vaccine than it is to get the actual illness.”Meet Our ExpertsSee Our Editorial PolicyMeet Our Health Expert NetworkJason Paul Chua, MD, PhDMedical ReviewerJason Chua, MD, PhD, is an assistant professor in the Department of Neurology and Division of Movement Disorders at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.

Caused by influenza viruses, the flu is a contagious respiratory disease that can cause mild to severe illness, and serious consequences of flu infection can result in hospitalization and at times can even lead to death, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. An annual flu vaccine is recommended for everyone 6 months of age and older. Vaccination is particularly important for people who are at high risk for serious complications from the flu, including children younger than 5 years, especially children younger than 2 years, adults 65 years of age and older, pregnant women and women up to two weeks postpartum, people with certain chronic health conditions, and residents of nursing homes and other long-term care facilities. Dr. Richard Friend, dean of CCHS and a family medicine physician, encourages people to get the flu vaccine every year. “Flu is ramping up, making us suspect that this year will be another active flu season,” Friend said. The quadrivalent flu shots are free to students, faculty, staff and spouses. In addition to the pop-up clinics on campus, students can visit the Student Health Center and Pharmacy and UA employees can visit the Faculty-Staff Clinic at UMC to get their free flu shots. Vaccinations are also available to dependents of UA employees. Children of employees with UA health insurance can receive flu vaccinations at UMC, and children of employees with non-UA health insurance can also receive flu shots at UMC if their insurance has approved nurse practitioner coverage. A complete list of flu shot times and locations is available on the CCHS website.

(Photo by Jamie McDonald/Getty Images / Getty Images) (FOX 9) - Bird flu is back in Minnesota, with a new case confirmed months after it was last previously detected. The highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has been confirmed in Meeker County turkey flock, the Minnesota Board of Animal Health said on Wednesday. The disease was last detected in Minnesota in May. The owners of the commercial turkey flock reported an increase in bird deaths last week, which led to a sample being collected and tested for bird flu. After a presumptive positive, the turkey flock was quarantined and has since been depopulated to stop the spread of the disease. "While the timing of this detection is a bit sooner than we anticipated, we have been preparing for a resurgence of the avian influenza we dealt with this spring," said Senior Veterinarian Dr. Shauna Voss. "HPAI is here and biosecurity is the first line of defense to protect your birds." The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says biosecurity is "paramount" to stop the spread of bird flu and other diseases, and flock owners should review biosecurity measures to maintain the health of their birds. When a flock is infected with bird flu, the Board of Animal Health establishes a 10-kilometer control area around the flock. Animal health officials also identify all properties with commercial or backyard poultry in the area. Flocks are then quarantined and go through disease surveillance to make sure the virus isn't spreading. The Minnesota Board of Animal Health reminds people that poultry is safe to eat and this strain of avian influenza is a low risk to the public. 2024 Election View More Minnesota election results: Roundup of key MN races Minnesota election results: Kamala Harris wins Minnesota in race for president Minnesota election results: Presidential results by county Minnesota election results: Lottery revenue ballot measure passes Minnesota election results: Angie Craig wins reelection in CD-2 Latest News View More Allergic to working out: MN woman face deadly condition linked to physical exertion Eagan police urge caution, increase patrols at Lebanon Hills Park after sexual assaults Neighbors recall St. Paul police shooting that left a man dead Billie Eilish fans camp out for singer's sold-out St. Paul show Minneapolis barber’s unsolved murder: Mother seeks justice, one year later Pedestrian killed after being hit on Highway 7 in Hopkins Sherburne County plans hand recount of election races Hunting accident: Man shot in Norman County Hunter shot in the head in rural Moorhead Man killed in St. Paul police-involved shooting, BCA investigating Family of fatal Owatonna hit-and-run victim seeks justice Hennepin County jail ordered to reduce its population, Sheriff Witt intends to appeal Lebanon Hills Regional Park sexual assault reports prompt extra police patrols Openly gay Pine City Mayor elected, making history for MN town Racist messages on phones received by Minnesotans, across the US Trending Meet the MN man traveling from Alaska to Argentina with 2 wheels and 1 compass Trump becomes the 1st Republican to win one MN county since Hoover Duluth shootings: 4 victims, suspect identified by police Minnesota weather: Showers to end early Sunday, sunny start to work week Family of fatal Owatonna hit-and-run victim seeks justice DAILY NEWSLETTER All the news you need to know, every day By clicking Sign Up, I confirmthat I have read and agreeto the Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.

The ‘Mitigation Strategy for Avian Influenza in Wild Birds in England and Wales’ advises land managers on how to make natural areas safe for the public, for example by adding signage warning visitors of the risk of avian influenza and what they can do to protect themselves, and having contingency plans to allow them to quickly respond to outbreaks. The guidance also sets out the government’s approach to monitoring the spread of avian influenza in wild bird populations and better understanding how the disease is distributed geographically and in which species of birds, with international best practice and the latest scientific and ornithological evidence underpinning this. Defra Biosecurity Minister Lord Benyon said: Our wild birds are facing exceptional pressures from avian flu this year and we have seen the tragic effect it has had – particularly on our seabird colonies. I very much share concerns about the impact avian influenza is likely to have on breeding populations of wild birds in the future, particularly those that nest in large numbers and represent some of our rarer and much loved species. We are funding a world leading science programme to try and better understand how avian influenza is spreading in wild birds and today’s guidance will help land managers, ornithologists and the public manage some of the issues we are facing. We will continue to work closely with partners to consider any further action we can take. This year’s avian influenza outbreak has been the largest and longest ever on record in the UK and in many parts of Europe, with infections continuing beyond the normal winter period and now hitting wild birds and breeding colonies of seabirds that are not typically affected. This comes as the UK’s Deputy Chief Veterinary Officer has declared an Avian Influenza Prevention Zone across Cornwall, Devon and parts of Somerset to mitigate the risk of further outbreaks of disease occurring. Covered extensively in regional media, the prevention zone means that all bird keepers in the area must follow strict biosecurity measures, such as cleansing clothing, footwear and equipment before and after contact with birds, reducing movement to and from areas where birds are kept, and thoroughly cleansing and disinfecting housing on a continuous basis.

Do ‘experts’ have any sort of pro active plan to combat this virus which I believe has already crossed over into other species. Could it mutate into another human pandemic ?

Cold & FluNewsWill There Be a Lot of Flu Going Around During the 2022-2023 Season?Masks and other COVID-19 safety measures kept flu cases low during the past 2 seasons. But the coming months could be very different.ByBecky UphamMedically ReviewedbyGrant Chu, MDPublished on September 1, 2022You may want to stock up on tissues and tea.Frank Grittke/Getty Images; CanvaThere’s a saying among flu experts that goes, “If you’ve seen one flu season, you’ve seen one flu season,” says Pritish Tosh, MD, infectious disease specialist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. “I’ve been studying the flu for over a decade, looking at internal data, external data, public health trends, and every year I’m surprised at what influenza does,” he says.Given all these curveballs, infectious disease specialists are wary about making predictions about future flu seasons. But Dr. Tosh and others note that, if recent history is any indication, the United States can expect an increase in flu activity after two years of fewer cases.Read on to learn more about what might be coming in the months ahead and what you can do to fight the flu.Why Does the Coming Flu Season Seem Different?Flu rates during the past two seasons have been low because of COVID-19 precautions. But this flu season, many of those protections are gone. Purvi S. Parikh, MD, of NYU Langone Health explains the risk.Next up video playing in 10 secondsCOVID-19 Precautions Stopped the Flu in Its TracksThe pre-pandemic 2019–2020 flu season was considered moderate, with about 35 million people in the United States becoming infected with influenza. This led to 380,000 hospitalizations and 20,000 deaths, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).But once COVID-19 began to hit the United States in spring 2020, the flu essentially disappeared. “That was the start of some of the preventative behavioral changes, such as people avoiding crowded places, people social distancing, and that sort of thing,” says Tosh. “Influenza cases plummeted — like, dropped off a cliff.”For the 2020–2021 flu season, the CDC recorded only 2,038 reported flu cases, with an estimated 700 deaths due to flu complications.The Easing of COVID-19 Restrictions Caused an Uptick in Flu CasesThe 2021–2022 flu season was another odd one, says Tosh. As COVID-19 restrictions continued to disappear and more people began taking off their masks, gathering indoors, and otherwise going back to “normal” life, the flu began circulating again.The CDC estimates that between 8 and 13 million people got sick with the flu during the 2021–2022 flu season, with a surprising uptick in cases in March and April 2022 — the first time that the flu peaked that late in the season since 1982, said Lynnette Brammer, MPH, head of the CDC’s domestic influenza surveillance team, in an interview with NBC News. Typically, the flu season peaks between December and February, the CDC notes.“Overall, the number of hospitalizations was less than we would see in normal previous years [pre-pandemic], but the duration certainly was not something we were used to,” says Tosh.Evidence Suggests a Challenging Flu Season AheadWith very few COVID-19 restrictions now in place, either in the United States or around the world, infectious disease experts are seeing evidence that suggests the flu will be making a comeback.As a predictor for what’s going to happen in the United States and the rest of the Northern Hemisphere, scientists look to flu trends in the Southern Hemisphere, where flu season begins six months earlier. “It’s not always an accurate forecast for our season, but if the same flu strains are dominant, things tend to look about the same,” says Tosh.This summer, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported increasing influenza activity in some Southern Hemisphere areas, particularly in temperate zones such as southern Africa, Australia, and New Zealand.In July this year, during Australia’s winter, flu cases surpassed rates seen prior to the pandemic, with weekly case numbers higher than the country’s five-year average, according to the Australian Department of Health and Aged Care.In addition to these high rates, the Australian metrics showed that flu season began in April, about two months earlier than usual, but it also ended a little earlier than what would normally be expected. Will the flu season also begin early in the United States? “It’s still difficult to predict,” Tosh says.Our Natural Immunity to the Flu May Be ReducedWhile no one wants to be sick with the flu, the lack of exposure to these viruses over the past two flu seasons might be problematic.Pre-pandemic, about 10 percent of the U.S. population would get influenza in a typical flu season, says Tosh. “Those people will get a bounce in their immunity, and there will also be a subsequent bounce in population immunity,” he says — meaning the community as a whole would benefit from the extra immunity, including people who never got the flu.Even people who are exposed to influenza but don’t get sick have an advantage going forward, because their immune systems make antibodies that “remember” the virus and how to attack it.“Because the last few flu seasons have been so mild, there may be as a result a decrease in the population immunity to influenza and so that would favor a worse flu season, but how that will play out is tough to say,” says Tosh.Tips to Prevent the Flu and PneumoniaNobody wants to get the flu or pneumonia, especially if you have diabetes. Here are a few ways to protect yourself!Next up video playing in 10 secondsSome Shifts Brought on by the Pandemic May Help Keep the Flu in CheckThe COVID-19 pandemic has had a lasting impact on some people’s behaviors and attitudes, and that might work to our collective favor in the fight against the flu. “For example, although many people have gone back to in-person work, there are going to be more people working from home than before the pandemic,” Tosh says.Although 60 percent of U.S. workers have jobs that require them to leave their houses, those who have that option to work from home are often continuing to do so, at least part of the time, according to a February 2022 Pew Research poll. More new jobs are allowing employees the option to work from home, too.“We are also seeing fewer people choosing to go into work when they are sick, which is a good thing,” says Tosh. Pre-pandemic, it was often viewed as a “badge of honor” to show up to work even when battling some sort of cold or other contagious illness, but now if you do that, you may find yourself shunned by your coworkers.“I think you’re going to see fewer sick people show up to work because the social pressure is different, and that change is probably going to last for a long time,” Tosh says.Another Good Sign: This Year’s Flu Vaccine May Be a Match for the Circulating StrainsA variety of data, including information about what flu viruses are circulating in different areas of the world at different times, are analyzed by the WHO and the CDC to decide what strains to include in the flu vaccine.The scarcity of flu strains in the 2020–2021 season made that task especially difficult, and the flu vaccine was not a great match for the virus last year, says Tosh. CDC data indicates it only reduced a person’s chance of getting a mild case of the flu by about 16 percent. Usually, the flu shot provides between 40 and 60 percent protection against infection, per the CDC, but can still reduce the risk for severe illness and hospitalizations.This year, the strains circulating in the Southern Hemisphere were well matched to the vaccine, says Tosh. “That doesn’t automatically predict a good match in the Northern Hemisphere, but it’s a good sign,” he adds.Getting a Flu Shot Is the Best Way to Avoid the Flu and Its ComplicationsThe best protection against influenza is to get a flu vaccine, says Tosh. “We sometimes forget that in a usual flu year, tens of thousands of Americans die from influenza, and a lot of that is due to severe complications, which is often preventable with the vaccine,” he says.“One thing that I hope we’ve learned from COVID is that even if you get an infection despite being vaccinated, the severity of the illness decreases. Getting the influenza vaccine reduces the risk of hospitalization and death due to the flu, especially in high-risk people,” says Tosh. Older people, people with certain medical conditions, and young children are at higher risk for complications of the flu, according to the CDC.In addition to getting the flu vaccine, there are other ways to protect yourself from influenza. The CDC recommends preventive actions to stop the spread of germs, which include the following measures:Avoid close contact with sick people.When you are sick, try to limit your contact with others.If you have a flu-like sickness, try to stay at home for at least 24 hours after your fever is gone.Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze, then throw away the tissue and wash your hands.Wash your hands often and avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth.Clean and disinfect surfaces and objects that may be contaminated with flu germs.Meet Our ExpertsSee Our Editorial PolicyMeet Our Health Expert NetworkGrant Chu, MDMedical ReviewerGrant Chu, MD, is an assistant clinical professor at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA.

From: Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs and Animal and Plant Health Agency Published 31 August 2022 This was published under the 2019 to 2022 Johnson Conservative government Following a number of detections of avian influenza in poultry and wild and captive birds across Devon, Cornwall and parts of Somerset, the UK’s Deputy Chief Veterinary Officer has declared an Avian Influenza Prevention Zone (AIPZ) across the region to mitigate the risk of further outbreaks of disease occurring. This means that from midday today (Wednesday 31 August) it is a legal requirement for all bird keepers in Devon, Cornwall (including the Isles of Scilly) and parts of Somerset to follow strict biosecurity measures to help protect their flocks, of whatever type or size. A map of the Avian Influenza Prevention Zone is available on gov.uk. Backyard owners with small numbers of poultry including chickens, ducks and geese must take steps to limit the risk of the disease spreading to their animals. Additionally, keepers with more than 500 birds will need to restrict access for non-essential people on their sites, workers will need to change clothing and footwear before entering bird enclosures and site vehicles will need to be cleaned and disinfected regularly to limit the risk of the disease spreading. The UK Health Security Agency continue to advise that the risk to public health from the virus is very low and the Food Standards Agency advice remains unchanged, that avian influenzas pose a very low food safety risk for UK consumers. Properly cooked poultry and poultry products, including eggs, are safe to eat. The UK has faced its largest ever outbreak of bird flu with over 130 cases confirmed across the country since late October. The introduction of this regional AIPZ comes after the disease was detected in captive birds at nine premises across the south-west region since last month, as well as several cases in wild seabirds. UK’s Deputy Chief Veterinary Officer Richard Irvine said: Following a number of detections of avian influenza we have declared an Avian Influenza Prevention Zone across Cornwall, Devon and parts of Somerset. This means that all bird keepers in the region must take action now to both prevent disease getting in to flocks and it spreading any further. Whether you keep just a few birds or thousands, you are now legally required to introduce higher biosecurity standards on your farm or small holding. It is in your interests to do so in order to protect your birds from this highly infectious disease. The introduction of an AIPZ follows the recent increase in cases of bird flu in poultry and other captive birds in the area and increased reports of mass mortality in wild birds. The AIPZ now in force across Devon, Cornwall and parts of Somerset does not include a requirement to house birds. However, this is being kept under constant review. Further disease control measures will be based on the latest scientific evidence and veterinary advice. The Avian Influenza Prevention Zone (AIPZ) means bird keepers across the south-west region of England must: cleanse and disinfect clothing, footwear, equipment and vehicles before and after contact with poultry and captive birds – if practical, use disposable protective clothing reduce the movement of people, vehicles or equipment to and from areas where poultry and captive birds are kept, to minimise contamination from manure, slurry and other products, and use effective vermin control thoroughly cleanse and disinfect housing on a continuous basis keep fresh disinfectant at the right concentration at all farm and poultry housing entry and exit points minimise direct and indirect contact between poultry and captive birds and wild birds, including making sure all feed and water is not accessible to wild birds prevent access by poultry to ponds and watercourses and ensure that birds are kept in fenced or enclosed areas The prevention zone will be in place until further notice, and will be kept under regular review as part of the government’s work to monitor and manage the risks of bird flu. Poultry keepers and members of the public should report dead wild birds to Defra’s national dead wild bird helpline on 03459 33 55 77 (please select option 7) and keepers should report suspicion of disease in their birds to APHA on 03000 200 301. Keepers should familiarise themselves with our avian flu advice. Defra has also set out practical guidance to support land managers, the public and ornithological and environmental organisations in their response to the growing threat of avian influenza to wild birds. The ‘Mitigation Strategy for Avian Influenza in Wild Birds in England and Wales’, also announced today, sets out how these groups, together with the government and its delivery partners, can mitigate the impact of avian influenza on wild bird populations whilst protecting public health, the wider environment and the rural economy.

To better understand how vaccine adjuvants AS03 and MF59 may provide improved antibody responses to vaccination, we interrogated serum from subjects who received 2 doses of inactivated monovalent influenza A/Indonesia/05/2005 vaccine with or without AS03 or MF59 using hemagglutinin (HA) microarrays (NCT01317758 and NCT01317745). The arrays were designed to reflect both full-length and globular head HA derived from 17 influenza A subtypes (H1 to H16 and H18) and influenza B strains. We observed significantly increased strain-specific and broad homo- and heterosubtypic antibody responses with both AS03 and MF59 adjuvanted vaccination with AS03 achieving a higher titer and breadth of IgG responses relative to MF59. The adjuvanted vaccine was also associated with the elicitation of stalk-directed antibody. We established good correlation of the array antibody responses to H5 antigens with standard HA inhibition and microneutralization titers.

These antigenically distinct influenza viruses are categorized into subtypes (i.e., H5, H7) based on phylogenetic characterization and sequence homology of the hemagglutinin (HA) gene, and are further sub-divided into clades. A key component of the US pandemic preparedness has been ongoing surveillance of prominent influenza viral clades, which may lead to their selection for development into vaccines that can be added to the National Pre-Pandemic Influenza Vaccine Stockpile (NPIVS)4. The rationale behind the stockpile is that a vaccine from pre-pandemic subtype viruses can provide partial cross-protection5, thereby benefiting vaccinated priority groups before a better-matched vaccine against the pandemic strain becomes available. The NPIVS program currently contains multiple pre-pandemic influenza antigens, representing various H5Nx and H7N9 avian influenza viruses.Inactivated subvirion influenza vaccines against avian HA strains have demonstrated poor immunogenicity in unprimed populations6. Therefore, the NPIVS program also maintains two immune-stimulating adjuvants (AS037 and MF598). These adjuvants are intended to be deployed with a respective vaccine antigen in a mix and match strategy to provide better immune responses to vaccination, which might translate to dose-sparing of the limited supply and faster onset, greater breadth, and/or longer duration of protection with vaccination9,10,11. One of the present gaps in knowledge is an understanding of the effect of these adjuvants on the breadth of the antibody responses elicited by pre-pandemic vaccines.Influenza HA is a major target for humoral immune responses, with antibodies directed towards the antigenically variable head domain (HA1) and the highly conserved HA stalk domain (HA2)12,13. In recent years, it has been determined that non-neutralizing, HA stalk-specific antibodies, which display the breadth of reactivity by ELISA, can confer protection from heterosubtypic influenza virus challenges in animal models14,15,16. Furthermore, such broadly reactive antibodies have recently been proposed as a correlate of protection in human cohort studies17 of natural influenza virus infection. Therefore, there is growing interest in identifying adjuvants that are capable of inducing such broadly reactive stalk-specific immune responses with the potential to confer breadth of protection against diverse influenza viruses18.One novel method for more comprehensively assessing the breadth of antibody responses is protein microarrays19,20,21. We constructed two sets of influenza-specific high-density protein microarrays which comprised purified HA proteins derived from 17 influenza A virus subtypes and influenza B virus strains, including conformationally correct stabilize trimers. Our present study was designed to measure the landscape of the antibody responses in response to vaccination with an inactivated, monovalent, subvirion influenza A/Indonesia/05/2005 (H5N1) strain vaccine when administered alone (unadjuvanted) or with AS03 or MF59 adjuvant. Importantly, using stabilized trimeric headless stalk protein (HA2) in competitive inhibition assays, we indirectly assessed the elicitation of stalk-directed antibodies. Finally, the concordance between microarray subtype-specific antibody levels and HAI and MN titers were evaluated.ResultsPre-vaccination reactivity against influenzas viruses and the impact of prior seasonal influenza vaccinationWe interrogated 390 serum specimens from 130 clinical trial volunteers who received two doses administered 21 days apart of inactivated influenza A/Indonesia/05/2005 (H5N1 clade 2.2.3) virus vaccine containing 15 µg of HA using two different protein microarrays. The vaccines were either unadjuvanted or included AS0311 or MF5922 adjuvants. Age ranged from 19 to 47 years with a median age of 27-28.5 years (Supplementary Table 1). Figure 1 summarizes our experimental design and array composition. Array #2 included 80 stabilized HA trimers not present on Array #1. Our results showed that these full-length stabilized trimeric HA0 molecules detected more antibodies than monomeric HA0 (Supplementary Fig. 1). We attributed this difference to the presence of additional conformational epitopes present in the stabilized trimers resulting in increased reactivity.Fig. 1: Study overview.a Study design. b Protein array antigen composition. c HA Subtype relationship51, H5 trimer structure, Mini-HA binding used for assessing percent anti-stalk competition49.Full size imageA birds’ eye overview of all IgG and IgA results for both arrays and antibody isotypes (IgG and IgA) is shown in Fig. 2. The heatmaps show pre-vaccination (day 0) reactivity patterns for each of the 3 vaccine groups were similar. For both Array #1 and Array #2, pre-vaccination IgG and IgA antibodies were highest against seasonal influenza virus antigens (H1, H3, or FluB) HA0 and HA1 (Supplementary Fig. 2), with higher responses against HA0 than HA1. While H5 antibodies ranked in the lower third for HA1 responses, their responses ranked slightly lower than seasonal virus antigens based on HA0 responses. We inferred that these reactivities against H5 HA0 as caused by cross-reactive antibodies were originally induced by seasonal H1 exposure, as these were presumed H5-naive subjects with no overt reason for prior exposure to H5 influenza. This prompted us to explore the impact of prior seasonal influenza vaccination on the microarray antibody responses. We found that subjects reporting seasonal influenza vaccination within the prior 2 years had lower fold changes in antibody intensities against vaccine subtype antigens (H5 HAs) relative to pre-vaccination irrespective of experiment, vaccine group, antibody type, or timepoint (Supplementary Fig. 3). Sex and age did not have a large impact.Fig. 2: Heatmaps summarizing experiments 1 & 2 protein array IgG and IgA results by vaccine group, day, HA molecule, and HA subtype.A, B log2 fluorescent intensity results by HA subtype for Experiment 1 IgG and IgA antibodies, respectively. C, D Corresponding results for Experiment 2. Each column represents one sample from a subject, and each row represents an antigen. The antigens are organized into groups, headgroup (HA1) or full-length molecule (HA0). The HA subtypes were grouped as H1/H3/FluB, H5, Other Group 1, and Other Group 2. Fluorescent intensities were background corrected, log2 transformed, and standardized across rows (z score, mean = 0, variance = 1). In red: intensities strongly increased compared to the mean log2 intensity, in dark gray: moderately increased compared to the mean in white decreased relative to the mean. Samples were ordered by increasing reactivity.Full size imageAdjuvant-mediated induction of antibodies against the HA1 and HA0 moleculeNext, we analyzed vaccine responses after adjusting for pre-vaccination levels and prior seasonal influenza vaccination. The mean log2 fold change relative to pre-vaccination adjusted for seasonal influenza vaccination is summarized in Fig. 3. The analysis compares the subtype-specific change in antibody levels to HA1 and HA0 induced by the three vaccine groups. Except for HB HA1, compared to adjuvanted vaccines, the unadjuvanted vaccine induced smaller log2 fold changes relative to pre-vaccination against HA1 among all the HA subtypes at both day 21 and day 42. The adjuvanted vaccines induced a substantial increase in IgG and IgA against H5 HA1 after the first dose and there was a noticeable further increase after the second dose. These adjuvanted vaccine responses against H5 HA1 were greater for AS03 than MF59 (Fig. 3). This average H5 HA1 boosting effect was observed for the majority of individual H5 HA1 antigens (Supplementary Fig. 4).Fig. 3: Adjuvants boosted IgG and IgA antibodies against head H5 HA proteins post the second dose.a Experiment 1 IgG and IgA radar plots summarizing the mean log2 fold change relative to pre-vaccination adjusted for prior seasonal influenza vaccination. b Corresponding Experiment 2 results. For each antigen, first, the mean log2 fold change in antibody fluorescent intensity relative to pre-vaccination adjusted for prior seasonal influenza vaccination was determined (LSMEAN). The value for each ray in the radar plot was then calculated as the mean of the LSMEANs for the respective antigen group, vaccine group, and timepoint combination.Full size imageHowever, the response patterns against H5 HA0 were less strong, in particular for Array #1 for Exp 1 (Fig. 3a). We attributed the more profound responses to HA1 compared to HA0 to cross-reactivity of antibody against the H5 stalk at pre-vaccination, which could have been elicited from prior seasonal group 1 vaccination or infection diminishing the fold change effect for H5 HA0. In addition, the day 21 IgG and IgA response for Array #2 used for Exp 2 against H5 HA0 for the adjuvanted groups was more pronounced than for Array #1 used for Exp 1 (Fig. 3b). This increase in H5 HA0 reactivity was also seen for the unadjuvanted vaccine group for IgG but not IgA. We attributed this difference between arrays to the presence of additional conformational epitopes present in 80 stabilized trimers resulting in increased average reactivity (Supplementary Fig. 1). Furthermore, a heterosubtypic cross-reactive response against group 1 HA1 and other group 2 HA1 was evident, in particular in the AS03-adjuvanted vaccine group, that was not much boosted with a second dose, which we interpreted as indicating heterosubtypic cross-reactivity against the conserved stalk (Fig. 3b). It is possible the heterosubtypic group 1 HA1 responses were to the N-terminus of HA1, which contains a conserved 115 amino acid sequence that forms part of the cross-reactive stalk (Fig. 1c).Adjuvant effect on heterosubtypic responsesTo statistically assess the impact of the adjuvants on heterosubtypic breadth of coverage, we fit ANOVA models for days 21 and 42 comparing adjuvanted vs. unadjuvanted responses adjusting for pre-vaccination and prior seasonal influenza vaccination (Fig. 4). For Array #1 Exp 1, at day 42 (21 days post second dose), AS03-adjuvanted vaccine elicited over twice as many significant IgG responses against HA antigens and broader coverage of significant responses against non-H5 HAs compared to MF59. This was demonstrated by a significant increase in IgG responses against 78 unique HA antigens in the AS03 group (47% non-H5 HA antigens) and 37 unique HA antigens in the MF59 group (22% non-H5 HA antigens). This difference in the proportion of recognition of non-H5 HA antigens was statistically significant (two-sided Fisher’s exact test <0.01) with the AS03 group eliciting more responses against non-H5 HA0 antigens (Fig. 4). All 37 unique HA antigens identified for the MF59 group were a complete subset of the 78 unique HA antigens in the AS03 group. For both adjuvanted groups, the most frequent responses relative to the unadjuvanted group were IgG responses against HA1 antigens (AS03: 73%, MF59: 89%), and these were predominantly among H5 HA1 antigens (AS03: 63%, MF59: 82%). When assessing IgA responses in Array #1 Exp 1, the AS03 group showed statistically significant responses against 28 unique antigens on day 21 and 37 antigens on day 42. Most of these AS03 responses (76%) were against HA0 at day 21, of which 43% were against non-H5 HA0; at day 42, 61% of the unique antigens were against HA0, of which 49% were against non-H5 HA0. A substantial additional number of H5 HA1 antigens were recognized by IgA at day 42 (30%) relative to day 21 (16%). In contrast to IgG, there were more IgA responses against HA0 with AS03 at day 42 (two-sided Fisher’s exact test <0.001).Fig. 4: Summary of statistically significant adjuvant-boosted antibody responses.For each antigen, an ANOVA model was fitted to day 21 and day 42 log2 fold change responses to assess the statistical significance of contrasts that compared adjuvanted vs. control group responses (AS03–PBS and MF59–PBS) adjusting for prior seasonal influenza vaccination using an FDR-adjusted p value <0.1.Full size imageFor the MF59 group, 42 statistically significant IgA responses were identified, of which 31 (74%) were against HA0 and from which 39% were against non-H5 HA0. In contrast to IgG, the difference in H5 vs. non-H5 HA antigen recognition on day 42 between the AS03 and MF59 group was not statistically significant. In Array #2 Exp 2, only the AS03 adjuvant was associated with statistically significant responses that differed compared to the unadjuvanted group (Fig. 4). This included IgG against 38 antigens, of which 31 (82%) were H5 HA and 7 (18%) were non-H5 HA antigens. While most H5 HA IgG responses were observed against HA1 (74%), responses against non-H5 HA were primarily observed against HA0 (86%). In addition, the AS03 group elicited statistically significant IgA response against 57 antigens on day 21 and 39 antigens on day 42. The majority of these responses were against HA0 antigens, of which 35% were against non-H5 HA0 on day 21 and 28% on day 42.Adjuvant effect on the antibody landscape of group 1 and 2 influenza virus antigensNext, to further assess heterosubtypic breath, we generated antibody landscapes that profile the antibody response against influenza virus antigens as a function of antigenic differences on the sequence level (Figs. 5–8). The landscapes contrast homosubtypic and heterosubtypic breadth and intensity of the IgG and IgA response against HA variants elicited by the three vaccine groups separately, against either the HA1 (Exp 1: Figs. 5, 6) or the HA0 molecules (Exp 2: Figs. 7, 8) and were adjusted for prior-influenza vaccination. On day 21, AS03-adjuvanted vaccine induced homosubtypic responses against H5 HA1 variants and heterosubtypic cross-reactive responses against closely related group 1 antigens that increased on day 42 (Figs. 5, 6). A similar pattern was seen with MF59, but the effect was less pronounced than for AS03. In contrast, the response with unadjuvanted vaccine, while still showing a distinct homosubtypic response against H5 HAs, was much weaker. Antibody landscapes for IgG against HA0 are shown in Fig. 7. In the adjuvanted vaccine groups, the IgG responses after a second dose (day 42) with HA1 (Fig. 5) were not seen against HA0 (Fig. 7). However, all three vaccine groups induced increased IgG against H5 HA0 proteins with similar intensities after one and two doses (Fig. 7). For IgA, in contrast to IgG, the higher response to a second dose was only seen in the adjuvanted groups and was absent from the unadjuvanted group (Fig. 8).Fig. 5: Adjuvants boosted IgG antibodies against head H5 HA proteins post second dose.IgG antibody landscapes for HA1 subunit antigens based on mean log2 fold change relative to pre-vaccination adjusted for seasonal influenza vaccination (Experiment 1).

Trends of anti-stalk blocking effects by mini H1 HA concentration are provided in Supplementary Fig. 5. The pre-incubation of serum specimens with mini-HA reduced up to 67% of the IgG and 57% of the IgA antibody binding responses against H5 detected on Array #2 relative to the negative control when using the intensity area under the curve for both concentrations (Fig. 10). We attributed this reduction in detected binding responses to competitive binding of the mini-HA to anti-stalk-specific antibody in the sample. At baseline (day 0), about 45% of the IgG responses and 30% of IgA responses against H5 were blocked by the mini-HA stalk. H5 immunization increased the percentage of anti-stalk antibody that was blocked by mini-HA. Baseline (pre-vaccination) specimens demonstrated a ~25–30% diminishment of the H1 HA0 IgG and IgA signal with mini-HA pre-treatment. After vaccination (days 21 and 42), the percentage of H1 HA0 IgG and IgA blocked by the mini-HA increased, consistent with an increase in vaccine-induced heterosubtypic cross-reactive antibody responses against H1.At day 21 (post-first dose), all three vaccine groups demonstrated the highest increase of stalk-directed responses relative to pre-vaccination. These purported stalk responses were primarily cross-reactive against H1 and H5 but also to a lesser extent other group 1 HA and HB antigens. Except for the IgG responses against H5, day 42 (post second dose) results for H1 and H5 demonstrated a further increase in percent anti-stalk responses, with the strongest increases observed for percent stalk-directed IgA responses against H5. For the adjuvanted groups, the day 42 IgG percent stalk antibody response was lower than that at day 21 while it slightly increased for the PBS group. For both adjuvanted groups, the decrease in percent anti-stalk IgG relative to the PBS group was statistically significant (AS03 and MF59 median=48%, PBS median=65%; two-sided Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test P < 0.05). We hypothesize this was the result of the majority of the antibody response being directed against the immunodominant headgroup of H5 subsequent to the second dose of vaccine. Interestingly, at day 42, after two doses of H5N1 vaccine, AS03-adjuvanted H5 vaccination showed an increase in percent anti-stalk IgG antibody against other HA groups 1 as well as HB HA0 antigens while MF59 responses decreased with an absolute median difference between adjuvant groups of ≥14% anti-stalk IgG antibody against HB (Fig. 9).Fig. 9: Median average percent anti-stalk blocking results for IgG and IgA antibodies against full-length HA antigens over time.Percent stalk competition (PSC) for each sample and antigen was calculated as: 100−(AUC with competition (mini-HA added)/AUC without competition (RSV-F negative control added) × 100) where the AUC represented the area under the curve for fluorescence intensity for two different concentrations of mini-HA (10 µg and 50 µg/mL). For each subject, PSC values were then aggregated across antigens for the respective antigen group using the mean. For each vaccine group (n = 10 each), the median AUC was determined. The error bars represent the 95% bootstrap confidence interval of the median. Dots represent individual average PSC results for each subject and time point.Full size imageCorrelation of microneutralization and hemagglutination inhibition titers with microarray dilution-based titersTo get a more robust assessment of antibody responses, we determined titers for a subset of sera from 30 subjects (10 per vaccine group) and two timepoints (day 21 and 42) (Fig. 1a, Fig. 10a). For each serum specimen, we performed eight twofold serial dilutions. Titers estimated from these serial-dilution experiments were assessed for correlation against the known hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) and microneutralization (MN) titers in the samples. We first compared the calculated titers from the four HA0 antigens on the array that matched the vaccine HA (H5 A/Indonesia/05/2005). The IgG dilution-based titers for H5 A/Indonesia/05/2005 correlated strongly with microneutralization titers at day 21 (rs: 0.51–0.56) and 42 (rs: 0.57–0.80) and with HAI titers at day 42 (rs: 0.49 to 0.74). Day 42 associations for a trimeric HA0 and the cleaved version of a monomer are presented in Fig. 10b. In all these cases, associations were statistically significant (p < 0.05), whereas, the IgA dilution-based titers correlations were less strong and were more dependent on the confirmation of the vaccine antigen analyzed (HAI or MN rs: 0.31–0.51 for day 21 and rs: 0.43–0.63) with only the trimeric HA0 reaching statistical significance at day 42 (r = 0.63, p < 0.05). All day 42 associations are shown in Supplementary Fig. 6.Fig. 10: Array-based titers determined in an 8 dilution-series experiment for vaccine antigens and antigens belonging to the same subtype as the vaccine antigen were significantly correlated with HAI and microneutralization titers.a Array results for eight dilutions for 60 sera. b Scatter plots of day 42 log2 dilution series-based titer and log2 hemagglutinin inhibition and log2 microneutralization titer for influenza A/Indonesia/05/2005 antigens across vaccine groups (n = 30) for HA0 trimer (left) and cleaved monomer (right). c The number and percentage of antigens with statistically significant Pearson correlations (p < 0.05) by assay, molecule, and subtype.Full size imageNext, we assessed the correlation patterns across all antigens (Fig. 10c). Assessment of statistically significant correlations (p < 0.05) across HA subtypes showed that these antigens were predominantly H5 full-length antigens which were of the same subtype as the vaccine (Fig. 10c). For IgG, the percentage of correlated responses among all H5 full-length antigens on the array increased from 60% to 74% for HAI following the second dose indicating an increase of 14% in correlated responses. For microneutralization, an increase from 65% to 75% was observed. In contrast, IgA dilution-based titers showed the broadest correlation against H5 full-length antigens on day 21 which decreased from 75% to 54% of all H5 full-length antigens on the array by HAI and 65% to 49% by MN on day 42.DiscussionDespite repeated exposures to seasonal influenza viruses and no known exposure to avian H5N1 viruses, our study participants’ serum exhibited antibodies with broad reactivity against all the subtypes of full-length HA represented on both arrays at baseline prior to immunization. Our data demonstrated that a large proportion of these baseline antibodies were directed against the stalk, presumably resulting from prior infection or vaccination. Prior exposure to seasonal viruses may also have elicited antibody against the N-terminus of HA1, containing a conserved 115 amino-acid sequence. These N-terminus HA1 antibody responses would not be diminished with the mini-HA blocking experiments because they were not included in the mini-HA structure. Existence of these antibodies also implied the existence of memory B cells that are highly cross-reactive.Our results confirmed that the A/Indonesia/05/2005 H5N1 vaccine when given without an adjuvant-induced limited antibody responses. This is likely a combination of the poor immunogenicity of avian HAs as well as the lack of innate immune signaling induced by adjuvants that enhance antigen processing and presentation23,24,25. The poor immunogenicity of unadjuvanted avian influenza vaccines is well documented23. One theory is that the head domains of avian (i.e., H5) HAs are so antigenically distinct from seasonal H1, that the head lacks available T cell epitopes which could provide CD4 T cell help/Tfh to B cells26,27. The germinal center response is capable of producing IgA response when the correct innate signals from the adjuvanted vaccine are present28,29. Alternatively, immune responses specific to the head depend on CD4 help, whereas the anti-stalk response is predominantly from the cross-reactive memory pool.The H5 HA1 response was low at baseline, slightly increased after the first dose of vaccine (prime), and significantly increased after the second dose (boost) in the context of an adjuvant, most markedly with AS03. In contrast, IgG and IgA responses against H5 HA0 increased after the first dose but were not significantly further increased with the second dose and the H5 HA0 response to the first dose was much more pronounced for the adjuvanted groups relative to the unadjuvanted group for IgA. To account for this differential boosting response, we speculate that the H5N1 HA1 is a novel variant antigen that has not been previously exposed to the immune system30. The priming dose is necessary to produce a memory response which is evident in the anamnestic response measured after the boost. Conversely, limited responses for H5N1 HA0 which is conserved across subtypes post the second dose, maybe due to their anti-stalk prime and memory from prior seasonal exposures. The anti-stalk antibody response is anamnestic after the first dose drawing on the memory pool and no further increase is seen after the boost. At baseline, about 50% of the responses against full-length H5 and approximately 25% against full-length H1 could be blocked by competitive inhibition with an H1 stalk trimer, providing evidence that a substantial percentage of the antibody against H5 HA0 was directed against the highly conserved stalk region31,32,33,34.Sixty specimens from this study were serially diluted 8 times to produce titration curves. Midpoint titers estimated from these serial-dilution experiments were assessed for correlation with the HAI and MN titers. Statistically significantly correlated antigens were present in predominantly H5 HA0 antigens of the same subtype as the vaccine. The fact that microarray-based dilution titers for vaccine antigens were statistically significantly associated with HAI and MN titer at day 42 lends additional confidence to these results and hints at their potential use as surrogates for HAI and MN titers.Subtype and drift variant virus specificity experienced with the H5N1 vaccine and with seasonal influenza vaccines may be related to the low level of heterosubtypic antibodies induced by unadjuvanted vaccines and with natural infection. The use of these potent immune-stimulating adjuvants demonstrated IgG and IgA levels which were high and more broadly reactive across drifted variants and subtypes than the unadjuvanted vaccine. This may translate to improved protective efficacy that is less prone to virus variants. Even when considering vaccine-mediated subtype-specific responses and vaccine efficacy, unadjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccination only demonstrated 50% effectiveness35,36. The MF59 adjuvated seasonal influenza vaccine (FluAd®) demonstrated some improved effectiveness compared to non-adjuvanted vaccines37,38. McElhaney et al. also report that the AS03-adjuvanted trivalent influenza vaccine in a phase 3 clinical trial resulted in improved outcomes compared to the unadjuvanted vaccine. Our data provide further evidence for both the AS0339 and MF5922 adjuvant as an effective means of eliciting a higher and broader antibody response compared to the unadjuvanted vaccine. While each adjuvant has previously been shown to enhance antibody responses post-vaccination11,22,40, our results add additional details comparatively assessing their breadth relative to the unadjuvanted vaccine using protein microarrays. Even though the two parallel parent clinical studies from which our specimens were derived were not originally designed to directly compare the performance of these two different adjuvants, the clinical protocols are sufficiently similar such that the antibody responses we describe can be generalized and compared. Although both adjuvants appeared to broaden the antibody responses predominantly to phylogenetically related HA proteins, those closely related to the vaccine strain as was evident by the antibody landscape results, AS03 elicited statistically significantly broader heterosubtypic antibody responses, compared to MF59 recognizing statistically significantly more non-H5 HA antigens post second dose. Furthermore, anti-stalk competitive inhibition and blocking experiments indicated that some of these broad antibody responses were directed against the conserved stem region of group 1 HA0s, in particular H1. These results seem to be in contrast with Khurana et al. showing from whole-genome gene fragment phage display libraries (GFPDLs) that for both MF59 and AS03, the adjuvant effect manifested itself mostly as a broader HA1 response with limited impact on HA230,41,42 We attribute this to the lack of stabilized trimeric molecules in phage display libraries. Interestingly, the AS03-adjuvanted group showed an increased percentage in anti-stalk competition for IgG for other group 1 HA0 and HB antigens after second dose relative to the MF59 group which showed a decrease. However, the difference was not statistically significant with our limited sample size warranting larger studies to assess if these broader anti-stalk responses following AS03-adjuvanted vaccination can be generalized.Results of this study inform efforts to the development of a universal influenza vaccine. While there are a number of universal vaccine candidates which are being developed using non-HA-based strategies (e.g., M2, nucleoprotein, neuraminidase), a large proportion of strategies are focused on conserved regions of HA43,44,45,46. Our data indicated that potent immune-stimulating adjuvants can improve the antibody responses elicited by standard subvirion vaccines through eliciting more homo- and heterosubtypic antibody. We observed that stalk-directed IgG and IgA antibody was primarily elicited with the first dose. If the elicitation of stalk-directed antibody were the key to protection through a universal influenza vaccine construct, then it may be essential to accompany the first dose with a potent adjuvant.The main limitation of this study is the relatively small sample size for the serial-dilution and anti-stalk experiments (n = 10 for each group). We utilized two arrays that each have certain limitations. While Array 1 contained a wider variety of HA1 antigens, all its HA0 antigens were monomers. In contrast, Array 2 contained fewer HA1 antigens (63 vs. 122) but more HA0 antigens (174 vs. 153) of which 80 (46%) were trimers. We presented results for both arrays so that differences can be contrasted.In summary, while both adjuvants greatly boosted antibody responses to H5 HA1 after 2 doses, there is evidence in the data of an increased heterosubtypic breadth as well as homosubtypic H5 head antibodies associated with AS03 relative to MF59 adjuvanted vaccination. Nonetheless, our study cannot substantiate an increase in the clinical efficacy of vaccination with AS03 for an H5N1 pandemic vaccine over MF59. In addition, our results highlight the importance of measuring dominant conformational epitopes present in trimeric HA. Together, these results support future clinical studies that utilize vaccine adjuvants to develop more effective, and more universally-reactive influenza vaccines.MethodsStudy specimenThe serum samples originated from future-use consenting participants of parallel avian A(H5N1)/Indonesia/05/2005 influenza vaccine mix and match studies involving MF59®22 and AS0311,40 adjuvant, also known as DMID Protocols 10-0016 and 10-0017. Only the participants that received the 15 µg dose of H5 vaccine were selected for the microarray analysis; three timepoints from each participant were selected and represent baseline (day 0 or pre-vaccination), day 21 (post-first dose of vaccine), and day 42 (21 days post second dose of vaccine).AdjuvantMF59 is an oil-in-water emulsion trademark owned by or licensed to Novartis and AS03 is an adjuvanted system containing DL-α-tocopherol and squalene in an oil-in-water emulsion owned by GlaxoSmithKline.Clinical trials registrationNCT01317758 and NCT01317745.ExperimentEach serum sample was diluted in protein array blocking buffer (GVS, Sanford, ME) supplemented with E. coli lysate (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ) to a final concentration of 10 mg/mL, and pre-incubated at room temperature (RT) for 30 min. Concurrently, arrays were rehydrated in blocking buffer (without lysate) for 30 min. Blocking buffer was removed, and arrays were probed with pre-incubated serum samples using sealed chambers to ensure no cross-contamination of samples between pads. Arrays were incubated overnight at 4 °C with gentle agitation. Arrays were then washed at RT five times with TBS-0.05% Tween 20 (T-TBS), followed by incubation with QDot®-conjugated goat anti-human IgG/ IgA diluted 1:200 in blocking buffer for 2 h at RT. After incubation in secondary antibodies, arrays were then washed three times with T-TBS and once with water. Chips were air dried by centrifugation at 1000×g for 5 min and scanned on an ArrayCamTM 400-S Microarray Imaging System from Grace Bio-Labs (Bend, OR) for QDot®. Spot and background intensities were measured using an annotated grid (gal) file. For ArrayCamTM a number of different settings were used to attempt to obtain readings. Microarray spot intensities were quantified using software ArrayCamTM (Grace Bio-Labs) utilizing automatic local background subtraction for each spot. The generated signal intensity values were considered raw values.Protein microarray compositionThe first array primarily contained monomeric HA (Array #1; Supplementary Table 2) and the second array consisted of both monomeric and trimeric HA (Array #2; Supplementary Table 3). Array #1 used for the first probing experiment (Exp 1) was composed of 284 antigens including 279 unique influenza HA antigens: 94 full-length HA (HA0; HA1 + HA2) and 80 HA1 from group 1 (including H5) influenza viruses; and 56 HA0 and 38 HA1 subunits from group 2 influenza viruses. Among the group 1 antigens were 44 HA0 and 36 HA1 subunits from H5 viruses (the same subtype as the vaccine strain). In addition, there were 4 HA2 subunit antigens (2 × H5, 1 × FluB, 1 × H1, which contain most of the stalk, although misfolded), 4 NA, and 1 NP protein on Array #1. These proteins were all acquired from Sino Biologicals. Array #2 used in the second probing experiment (Exp 2) was composed of 270 unique influenza proteins including 239 HA proteins, representing 161 (57%) proteins that were included in Array #1 (Sino Biologicals), plus 80 HA0 trimers and 22 NA proteins, provided by the Dr. F. Krammer laboratory and Dr. J. Crowe laboratory. Array #2 contained 95 HA0 and 45 HA1 subunits from group 1 influenza viruses and 69 HA0 and 17 HA1 subunits from group 2 influenza viruses. Among the group 1 antigens were 50 HA0 and 33 HA1 subunits from H5 viruses. In addition, 2 HA2 antigens from H5 viruses, 1 NP, and 30 NA proteins were present on Array #2.Data normalizationPrior to the analysis, systematic intensity differences in background reactivity as measured by phosphate-buffered saline with tween 20 (PBST) were corrected. This was achieved by subtracting the median raw intensity signal for the 24 PBST intensity measurements for a certain array from the array’s non-PBST antigen intensities. Following background correction, for intensities <1, an intensity value of 1 was imputed.Identification of significant adjuvant-boosted antibody responsesFor each antigen, an ANOVA model was fit separately to day 21 and day 42 log2 fold change (LFC) responses from day 0 as part of the first and second probing experiments. The model was specified to describe the LFC in antibody signal for a certain antigen as a function of vaccine group (fixed effect with three levels: A/H5N1 HA + AS03, A/H5N1 HA + MF59, and A/H5N1 HA + PBS) and receipt of seasonal influenza vaccine during the past two years (fixed effect with two levels: yes, no). The second fixed effect was added to adjust antibody responses for seasonal influenza vaccine effects. Contrasts as implemented in the lsmeans R package (Version 2.27.62) were used to assess statistical significance of the mean LFC difference between the adjuvanted vaccine groups (A/H5N1 HA + AS03 and A/H5N1 HA + MF59) and the unadjuvanted control group (A/H5N1 HA + PBS) adjusted for prior receipt of vaccine (H0: μadjuvanted vaccine group −μ unadjuvanted control group = 0, H1: μadjuvanted vaccine group − μunadjuvanted control group ≠ 0, on the log2 scale). To control for testing multiple antigens, a false-discovery rate (FDR) based on the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure as implemented in the R p.adjust function was applied separately for each post-vaccination day (day 21 and 42) and vaccine group comparison. Antibody responses with an FDR-adjusted p value <0.1 were deemed statistically significant.Determination of percent anti-stalk competitionWe used a stabilized trimeric mini H1 HA recombinant stalk molecule47,48,49 (#4900), produced by Dr. L. Coughlan laboratory, which lacks the entire HA1 head including the HA1 segment that interacts with the stalk. As a negative control, we used a pre-fusion stabilized trimeric RSV-F protein (DS-Cav1 5K6I, also produced by Dr. L. Coughlan laboratory)50, We performed anti-stalk experiments for a subset of sera from 30 subjects (10 per vaccine group) that were probed on Array #2. Percent stalk competition (PSC) was calculated as: 100−(AUC with competition (mini-HA added)/AUC without competition (RSV-F added) × 100) where the AUC represented the area under the curve for two different concentrations of mini-HA and RSV-F (10 and 50 µg/mL). The AUC was calculated using the trapezoid rule implemented in R. To prevent negative values, for PSCs that were <1%, a value of 1% was imputed.Determination of antibody titers from serial-dilution experimentsDilution experiments consisted of eight serial twofold dilutions (0.04, 0.02, 0.01, 0.005, 0.0025, 0.00125, 0.000625, 0.0003125) for day 21 and 42 specimens for a subset of 30 subjects (10 per vaccine group) that were probed on Array #2. This information was used to estimate the half maximal effective dilution, referred to as a titer. For each sample, the titer was determined using the following binding model \(A + B\mathop { \to }\limits^{\rm{yields}} AB\) where A is the antigen and B is the antibody. The functional relationship between intensity (y) and dilution (x) was described using the Michaelis-Menten equation: \(y = \frac{{{{{I}}}_{\rm{max}} \times x}}{{{{{K}}}_{\mathrm{d}} + x}}\). The two model parameters (Imax and Kd) were then estimated by fitting non-linear models as implemented in the nls R package. The resulting titer per sample was determined as 1/Kd which represented the titer estimate at which half the level of Imax was reached.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.

Using face masks may help prevent the transmission of infectious respiratory conditions such as the flu.Share on PinterestA quick look at 5 of the best face masks for flu protectionBest for a surgical mask: Dynarex Medical Surgical Protective Face MaskBest for a reusable cloth mask: EnerPlex EXTREME Comfort Cloth Face MaskBest for a mask with a flow valve: 3M Particulate Respirator 8511, N95Best for a microfiber mask: 3M Particulate Respirator 8210, N95Best for a good seal: 3M 1860 N95 Health Care Particulate Respirator and Surgical MaskIt is important to note that although wearing face coverings may reduce the risk of contracting airborne illnesses such as the flu to some degree, there are no guarantees that they will prevent a person from getting sick.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends people consider wearing masks if they have symptoms of the flu and cannot stay at home during the illness. Additionally, it recommends that parents or caregivers who have the flu wear a mask while caring for or nursing infants.However, getting annual vaccinations is the primary method of preventing influenza in people at high risk.Some people may want to use masks to help reduce their risk or the risk for those around them, especially while sick. This is especially important for people who are sick and have compromised immune systems. People caring for those with compromised immune systems should also wear face masks as often as possible.Simple face coverings and disposable surgical masks are the best options, as they have similar rates of protection from the flu and do not take away from medical professionals and other workers who rely on N95 masks.How we choseMedical News Today chooses masks based on the following criteria where possible:Type of mask: MNT chooses a range of masks, including surgical, cloth, and N95s.Comfort: MNT chooses masks that provide an adjustable fit or a range of sizes to fit most people.Amount of masks: MNT chooses companies that offer multiple masks per purchase.Cost: MNT chooses masks that fit a range of budgets.5 of the best masks for flu protectionBelow are five options a person may consider.Please note that the writer of this article has not tried these products.

These layers help temporarily filter non-oily and other particles.The masks have a folded design that completely covers the nose and mouth. The elastic bands tend to be more comfortable than those of some other options.Compared with other options, however, these masks can be hot. They are also not very durable, but because they are intended for only a few hours of use, this should not be a significant issue.A study in the journal JAMA found no significant difference between using a medical mask such as this and using a surgical respirator when it comes to preventing influenza. The study focused on over 2,800 healthcare workers.Surgical masks may actually be most important for people who already have symptoms, in order to reduce community spread. A 2020 study in the journal Nature Medicine found that even poorly fitting surgical masks can significantly reduce the levels of infectious particles that a person with an airborne illness exhales.SHOP NOWBest for a reusable cloth mask: EnerPlex EXTREME Comfort Cloth Face MaskList price: around $25Amount of masks: three per purchasePro: stretch ear loops for a more secure fitCon: not as effective as surgical or N95 masksA number of companies make cloth masks for everyday use. Thick, heavy layers of cloth, such as cotton or flannel, can make a decent everyday filter when a person does not have immediate access to a surgical mask.These masks may reduce the airborne particles that a person releases when they speak, which may reduce community transmission from direct contact with viral particles.However, a 2015 study found that 97% of particles penetrated cloth masks in comparison to 44% in surgical masks. A 2020 review states that cloth masks are half as effective as surgical masks, but people can increase protection by ensuring a proper seal, such as by taping the sides of the mask to the face. The authors also state that cloth masks are better than no protection if a person is at high risk of contracting respiratory viruses such as COVID-19.Therefore, any cloth mask should cover both the nose and the mouth, fit snugly around the face, and have secure straps or ties.This mask is available in three sizes, which may help provide a more secure fit. It has three layers, which may increase protection. It is also available in 13 colors.SHOP NOWBest for a mask with a flow valve: 3M Particulate Respirator 8511, N95List price: around $16Amount of masks: 10 per purchasePro: may be less hot to wear due to the flow valveCon: not many sizes availableN95 masks have National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) approval, as they block tiny particles and pollutants in the air from getting into the airways. This includes dust and other occupational hazards. They also block out some mold spores and infectious germs.These N95 respirators are breathable compared with other options, while still providing a good seal due to the adjustable nose clip.This version of the mask also features a flow valve to help with moisture buildup while filtering. However, this also means that a little unfiltered air gets both in and out of the mask.There are also not many sizes to choose from. People with very large or very small faces may not find the masks comfortable for everyday use.The straps are highly elastic, but not very adjustable, which may cause discomfort or irritation for some people.SHOP NOWBest for a microfiber mask: 3M Particulate Respirator 8210, N95List price: around $19Amount of masks: 20 per purchasePro: adjustable nose clips for a tighter sealCon: no adjustable elastic strapsThese masks are a more simple form of N95 mask that is still NIOSH-approved. The masks are made from a microfiber filter, which helps block out particles from the environment.These masks have a nose clip for some level of adjustability and to help create a tight seal.That said, the masks do tend to feel hotter and more humid, as they lack any valve system to allow air out. Some people may also find the masks uncomfortable, as the elastic straps are not adjustable and may be tight.SHOP NOWBest for a good seal: 3M 1860 N95 Health Care Particulate Respirator and Surgical MaskList price: $29.99Amount of masks: 20 per purchasePro: creates a firm seal around the mouth and noseCon: may be hotter to wear than other optionsThe company states that these masks can effectively filter certain viruses and bacteria.The masks can hold their shape and create a good seal around the mouth and nose. Additionally, the masks are splatter resistant against fluids and other infectious materials.However, they have a relatively short shelf life and only last about 3 years on the shelf before becoming less effective. They also do not have an exhalation vent, making them a little hotter than some other options.SHOP NOWComparison chartThe following table compares the masks in this article.Dynarex Surgical MaskEnerPlex EXTREME3M Particulate Respirator 85113M Particulate Respirator 82103M 1860 N95 Surgical MaskType of masksurgical maskclothN95N95N95Disposable or reusabledisposablereusabledisposabledisposabledisposableAmount of masks503102020NIOSH approved?no information availablenot approvedapprovedapprovedapprovedPricearound $8around $25around $16around $19$29.99How to choose a face mask for fluPeople may wish to consider the following when choosing a mask:Fit: People should ensure the mask will fit snugly around the nose, mouth, and chin. Poorly fitting masks will increase the risk of virus transmission.Layers: Both cloth and medical procedure masks have multiple layers of material. More layers decrease the risk of particles penetrating the mask.Nose wires: Some masks may have nose wires or nose clips that help create a secure and snug fit. Other considerationsAlthough wearing a face mask is an important preventive measure against airborne viruses such as the flu, there is no guarantee that it will prevent transmission completely.As the CDC note, adults with influenza can be contagious 1 day before and up to 7 days after they show symptoms of the illness. Because of this, the spread of influenza may occur when people are unaware that they have the infection.However, taking steps to reduce the chances of transmission may help prevent the spread of infection.Wearing a face mask is not the only measure a person can take, however. The first line of defense for people at risk is getting an annual flu vaccination.Influenza can also spread indirectly when a person comes into contact with an infected surface. Regularly washing hands and sanitizing shared surfaces are also important steps to take to reduce the spread of the flu, especially during flu season.Other ways to protect against fluThe CDC states that the yearly flu vaccination is the best way to minimize a person’s risks of catching this virus and avoiding any potential complications.People may also protect themselves from the flu by making the following changes:avoiding close contact if one or more person is illstaying home from work, school, and any other gatherings if a person is illcovering the mouth and nose while coughing and sneezingcleaning and washing the hands regularlyavoiding touching the eyes, nose, and mouthcleaning and disinfecting surfaces regularlyhaving a restful sleepexercising regularlyeating a healthy, balanced, dietFrequently asked questions about flu masksHere we answer some common questions about masks for flu protection.What is the most protective reusable mask?There is a wide range of quality face masks currently available including cloth masks, medical-grade masks, KN95s, and N95s.A 2021 study comparing reusable cloth masks, disposable surgical masks, KN95s, and N95s found that N95s with filtering facepiece respirators offered the most protection for people who were at high risk of contracting airborne respiratory illnesses.Is any N95 mask good for flu?A 2019 study found that there is no significant difference in the effectiveness of N95 or surgical masks in preventing flu transmissions.However, a more recent 2021 study found that N95s with filtering facepiece respirators may offer the most protection against airborne viruses.Do masks protect from the flu virus?Masks can help protect people from the flu virus.A 2020 review found that mask use can reduce the risk of contracting a respiratory illness by up to 80%, including the flu virus and COVID-19.SummaryTaking steps to protect against the flu is important, especially for people who may be more at risk of serious complications from these infections.Wearing face masks is not a guaranteed way to prevent flu infection, as people can be infectious without knowing it.That said, taking precautions such as wearing a face mask while sick can help reduce community spread.People with a higher risk of complications from influenza may want to consider other preventive measures, such as getting an annual vaccine.Flu / Cold / SARSInfectious Diseases / Bacteria / VirusesShare this articleMedically reviewed by Jenneh Rishe, RN — Written by Jon Johnson and Anne deLeeuw — Updated on August 31, 2022Latest newsClassic and green Mediterranean diets may help slow brain agingRheumatoid arthritis linked to changes in the gut microbiome in new studyDaytime sleepiness may be a sign of higher dementia riskCould taking fish oil supplements help lower cancer risk?Can a combo of “active” therapies help lower dementia risk?Related CoverageThe flu: Is it contagious?Medically reviewed by Angela M.

DunleavyMedically ReviewedbyJason Paul Chua, MD, PhDUpdated on August 30, 2022Talk to your healthcare provider about the best timing and choice of flu vaccine.Luis Alvarez/Getty ImagesGetting vaccinated against the flu is an essential part of maintaining overall health during the winter season — but is the flu shot safe for people with MS or, more specifically, people taking disease-modifying therapies for multiple sclerosis (MS)?In general, the answer to that question is “yes,” but there are some details to take into consideration, according to Amit Bar-Or, MD, chief of the multiple sclerosis division at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.“There’s no reason to consider the flu shot as riskier for people with MS,” Dr. Bar-Or says. “Just having MS does not increase risk for adverse outcomes with the vaccine.”In fact, in guidelines updated in 2019, the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) recommended that people with MS get vaccinated against the flu annually, unless there’s a specific reason they can’t get it, such as an allergy to the vaccine.However, certain types of flu vaccine — there are more than a dozen formulated each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) — aren’t recommended for people on specific MS treatments, according to the National MS Society. This is because the vaccines may not be as effective at preventing the flu in people taking these drugs, the society says.Still, because there are many different flu vaccines available, you can find one that offers protection against the seasonal virus, Bar-Or notes.Here’s an overview of the types of flu vaccines and which ones may be impacted by your MS treatment.Why Do People With MS Need to be Careful About Getting a Flu Shot?People with multiple sclerosis have good reason to get the flu shot every year, because the disease and certain MS treatments can leave them vulnerable to complications, says Purvi S. Parikh, MD, of NYU Langone Health.Next up video playing in 10 secondsTypes of Flu Vaccine Flu, or influenza, vaccines are designed to generate antibodies against the virus in your body, and they should reach protective levels within a few weeks after you receive the shot, according to the CDC.Antibodies are proteins created by your immune system that provide protection against infection with the virus that’s targeted by the vaccine. The vaccine’s formulation can vary from year to year based on what research suggests will be the most common flu variants during the winter season, the agency says.A few different processes are used to make flu vaccines:Inactivated (Killed) Flu Vaccines These are the injections most often called “flu shots,” the CDC says. The candidate vaccine viruses are grown in chicken eggs then inactivated (or killed) and purified. The inactivated flu vaccine therefore contains no live flu virus and cannot cause the flu. Some inactivated flu vaccines are made using mammalian cells to grow the flu virus instead of eggs.Live-Attenuated Influenza Vaccine This type of vaccine is made from weakened influenza viruses. These weakened viruses stimulate your immune system to create sufficient antibodies to fight off stronger forms of the virus. In the United States, live-attenuated flu vaccines are available in a nasal spray and are made in an egg-based process.Recombinant Flu Vaccines These vaccines aren’t made using candidate vaccine virus samples. Instead, they’re made synthetically, based on the RNA of naturally occurring flu viruses. They may be made in egg-based manufacturing processes, or using cell-based approaches, according to the CDC.How MS Treatment May Impact Live and Live-Attenuated Flu VaccineLive and live-attenuated vaccines, including the live-attenuated flu vaccine, aren’t recommended for people with MS who take certain types disease-modifying therapies (DMTs), because the vaccines’ effectiveness may be reduced by these drugs, according to the National MS Society.However, this isn’t a reason to avoid vaccination altogether, Bar-Or says, if live and live-attenuated vaccines are your only option, as some protection is better than no protection.In some cases, however, DMTs may weaken the immune system, meaning those people injected with live or live-attenuated vaccines may be at risk for getting sick from the viruses the vaccines are designed to prevent, the society adds.MS Drugs That May Reduce Live Vaccine EffectivenessAccording to the AAN guidelines, research suggests that certain MS drugs, including dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera), diroximel fumarate (Vumerity), fingolimod (Gilenya), glatiramer acetate (Copaxone, Glatopa), interferon beta-1a (Avonex, Rebif), interferon beta-1b (Betaseron, Extavia), mitoxantrone (Novantrone), natalizumab (Tysabri), and teriflunomide (Aubagio) may reduce the effectiveness of the live and live-attenuated flu vaccine.This doesn’t make the vaccine dangerous — it just means that it may not offer as much protection against the flu, Bar-Or says.Additionally, the reduction in vaccine protection caused by these medications may be small, so the shot will still offer significant protection against the flu virus, even while taking them, he says.MS Drugs That May Weaken Your Immune SystemHowever, the DMTs alemtuzumab (Lemtrada), cladribine (Mavenclad), ocrelizumab (Ocrevus), ozanimod (Zeposia), and siponimod (Mayzent) may weaken your immune system enough that live and live-attenuated vaccines, including the live-attenuated flu vaccine, shouldn’t be used or should only be used after taking precautions, the National MS Society advises. This is because even the weakened forms of the virus could make you sick.For this reason, people with MS taking alemtuzumab, or who have recently taken the drug, shouldn’t receive any live vaccines, including the flu vaccine, the society says. In addition, people taking ozanimod and siponimod shouldn’t get these vaccines.People with MS also shouldn’t start treatment with cladribine until four to six weeks after receiving a live or live-attenuated vaccine.And treatment with ocrelizumab shouldn’t be initiated until at least four weeks after you’ve received one of these vaccines — although it can be initiated two weeks after receiving an inactivated vaccine.MS B Cell TherapiesB cell therapies used in the treatment of MS — including ocrelizumab, ofatumumab (Kesimpta), and rituximab (Rituxan) — may partially limit effectiveness of the flu vaccine, according to Bar-Or. He notes that these medications are designed to kill immune cells called B cells which, on one hand, are believed to play a role in the development of brain lesions in people with MS, but on the other hand, also serve as the cells that help the immune system make protective antibodies as part of the immune system’s ideal response to infection or vaccination. By leading to the death of B cells, these drugs can therefore make the vaccine less effective, at least as far as generating the antibody response is concerned.Bar-Or explains that “antibodies are generated through the activation of B cells, hence MS treatments that remove these cells result in a substantial decrease in the ability of the vaccine to generate antibodies.”“Since the effectiveness of vaccines is typically assessed based on their ability to generate an antibody response (such as anti-flu antibodies), it may appear that patients vaccinated while on B-cell-depleting therapies cannot mount any useful vaccine response,” he says. “However, assessing vaccine responses based only the antibody response in patients treated with B cell therapies likely underestimates the utility of the vaccines, since cellular immune responses to the vaccines (which are more important than antibody responses for many vaccines) are likely to be minimally impacted by the B cell therapies.”The Best Flu Vaccines for People With MS According to Bar-Or, all recombinant flu vaccines — those made synthetically, without use of the flu virus — are safe for people with MS, even those on DMTs.Similarly, inactivated vaccines are generally considered safe for people with MS, including those taking a disease-modifying therapy, according to the Cleveland Clinic.Other commonly used drugs in the treatment of MS — including the muscle relaxant baclofen, the stimulant modafinil (Provigil), and low-dose naltrexone — don’t affect the flu vaccine, or its safety, in any way, according to the National MS Society.Still, you should talk to your doctor about which flu vaccine is best for you, given the medications you take for your MS or for any other medical condition you may have.In addition, although it’s fine to get the vaccine at a doctor’s office, pharmacy, or clinic — just like anyone else — you should mention to whoever is administering the vaccine that you have MS to make sure you get the correct product, Bar-Or advises.Meet Our ExpertsSee Our Editorial PolicyMeet Our Health Expert NetworkJason Paul Chua, MD, PhDMedical ReviewerJason Chua, MD, PhD, is an assistant professor in the Department of Neurology and Division of Movement Disorders at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.

Running over three years, the award will support preclinical, manufacturing and non-clinical safety studies, along with development and regulatory support for the tech for rapid pandemic influenza response through Phase 1 clinical studies.It will be used to develop a low-dose, freeze-dried, pandemic influenza vaccine candidate using Arcturus’ Starr self-amplifying mRNA vaccine platform technology.This tech has already been used in the San Diego company’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate, which has demonstrated a favorable safety and efficacy profile (the company announced it April that the candidate, ARCT-154, met its primary efficacy endpoint in a Phase 3 study​).Furthermore, the tech can be used to create a vaccine with a stable cold chain profile which could help government pandemic preparedness goals.“Arcturus’ next generation mRNA platform has been administered to over 10,000 individuals globally demonstrating favorable safety, strong immunogenicity, and protection against SARS-COV-2 infection,”​ said Joseph Payne, President and CEO of Arcturus Therapeutics.“Our lyophilized vaccines have the potential to provide safe and effective protection against disease with the specific advantage of rapid scale-up, lower doses, and easier transport and storage. These are qualities that are essential to a rapid response against pandemic influenza and are consistent with strategic objectives of the US government’s National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza.”​ Copyright - Unless otherwise stated all contents of this web site are © 2024 - William Reed Ltd - All Rights Reserved - Full details for the use of materials on this site can be found in the Terms & Conditions Related topics Bio developments Related news Show more Universal mRNA flu vaccine could help protect against future pandemics Blue Water Vaccines to develop oral chlamydia vaccine EdiGene Biotechnology moves into new R&D center in Massachusetts FDA expected to make decision on GSK’s RSV vaccine in May Show more Follow us Facebook Twitter Linkedin Webinars On-demand webinars Manufacturing Friendly Aggregate Clearance in Downstream Processing of Bispecific and Traditional Antibodies Using a Novel POROS Mixed-Mode Chromatography Media Thermo Fisher Scientific - Biosciences Headlines Aditum Bio and Leads Biolabs join forces in new company to fight autoimmune diseases Sarepta discontinues development of Duchenne ASO treatment vesleteplirsen Synaffix and BigHat Biosciences collaborate to develop AI-designed ADC EMA accepts Alvotech and Advanz Pharma’s Marketing Authorization Application for biosimilar of J&J’s Simponi AbbVie acquires Aliada Therapeutics in $1.4 billion deal Abzena announces major expansion of its biologics manufacturing facility Aldevron’s Anu Codaty on passion, leadership, and innovation AstraZeneca’s rare disease therapy Fasenra receives EU approval Follow us Facebook Twitter Linkedin BioPharma-Reporter Advertise with us Why Register?

The virus was initially isolated from a farm goose in China’s Guandong Province. Since then, several strains have circled the globe.The most recent strain is known as Highly Pathogenic Eurasian H5N1 Avian Influenza. The strain has gone global affecting domestic and wild bird populations and crossing into other species including humans. Krysta Rogers, a senior environmental scientist with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, confirmed that the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 has officially been detected in Mendocino County. On July 20, 2022, a wood duck was found dead in a pond within county lines and reported to her agency. Upon analysis, the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 was detected and found present in the waterfowl.A press release issued yesterday by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife indicates that the virus has been attributed to the death of 34 wild birds found in 13 counties including Butte, Colusa, Glenn, Mendocino, Placer, Plumas, Sacramento, Santa Clara, Siskiyou, Solano, Sonoma, Stanislaus, and Yolo.This specific strain is said to be causing illness and death at higher rates than previous strains of avian influenza. Waterfowl, raptors, and avian scavengers have been particularly vulnerable to the virus which is nearly always fatal.- Advertisement - Rogers provided guidance to mitigate the spread of the H5N1 strain amongst both wild and domestic birds:Avoid providing food or water to wild birds, especially if backyard chickens or other domestic birds are present. Do not allow wild birds to enter domestic bird enclosures. For those who recreate in areas with large amounts of waterfowl, take the time to disinfect footwear and clothing to mitigate potential spread to other sites. To disinfect, wash affected articles of clothing with soap and water, then soak in a 1:10 bleach/water solution for ten minutes.The Center for Disease Control considers the risk of spread to humans low but recommends limiting contact with wild birds and sick or dead poultry. If there is a need to dispose of a dead bird, wear gloves, place it in a trashcan, and wash hands with soap and water while also changing and washing the clothing worn while disposing of the bird.There is no known vaccine or treatment for this strain of avian influenza. At this point, the biggest tool in controlling the virus is tracking its spread. The public can help in that process by using CDFW’s mortality reporting form if a sick or dead wild/domestic bird is located.- Advertisement - LEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply Comment: Please enter your comment!

Read ahead to know more.Written by: Tanya SrivastavaUpdated at: Aug 29, 2022 18:44 ISTSHAREFOLLOWAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO) seasonal influenza is an acute respiratory infection caused by influenza viruses, which circulate in all parts of the world. It is a self-limiting disease and causes illnesses that range in severity and sometimes lead to hospitalisation and death. The high risk groups are children, elderly, pregnant women, health workers and those with chronic medical conditions. Worldwide, these annual epidemics are estimated to result in about three to five million cases of severe illnesses, and about 290,000-650,000 respiratory deaths, as per a WHO report. How is influenza spread? People who suffer with flu symptoms can spread it to others up to about 6 feet away. According to the experts, flu viruses also spread mainly by droplets made when afflicted people cough, sneeze, or talk around others. These droplets can land in the mouths, hands, or noses of people who are nearby. or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. thereby making the virus spread more. Symptoms of Influenza High Fever Aching muscles Headache Dry and persistent cough Chills or sweats Shortness of breath Tiredness and fatigue Is the flu similar to COVID-19? The cases of seasonal influenza saw a steep rise post the monsoon season, as compared to the last two to three years, according to doctors and health experts. It is also to be noted that swine flu, COVID-19 and seasonal influenza all have similar symptoms. However, influenza can cause severe illness or death, particularly among high risk people. Nonetheless, it is suggested that a person showing the signs and symptoms of the flu should also get tested for COVID-19 at the time of diagnosis.

Hydration Hydration is one of the first pieces of advice when a person gets sick with the cold or seasonal flu. Therefore, one must drink lots of fluids. Keeping up a steady intake of water, tea, or fruit juices will help in recovering faster and easing the symptoms. Additionally, warm soups and coconut water is a great way to prevent dehydration. 2. Rest A well rested mind and body will heal better and faster. So, get more sleep to help the immune system fight the infection. It is also suggested that a person needs to change their activity level, depending on the symptoms. 3. Pain relievers Consuming over-the-counter pain relievers can help in combating the aches associated with influenza virus. Kids and teenagers recovering from flu-like symptoms are advised to not take aspirin because of the risk of Reye's syndrome. Reye's syndrome is a rare but potentially an extremely fatal condition in which a child's blood sugar level drops while the levels of ammonia and acidity in their blood rise. 4. Avoid crowded places The flu spreads easily wherever people gather since the virus is spread in the form of droplets. The transmission is more likely in public spaces like schools, office buildings, auditoriums, and public transportation. Therefore, avoiding crowds during peak flu season will help in reducing the chances of the infection. 5. Hygiene Washing hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds is an effective way to prevent many common infections. Otherwise use alcohol-based hand sanitisers if soap and water aren't available at the moment.Read NextExpert Talk: Different Types of Monsoon Infections And How To Manage ThemDisclaimer All possible measures have been taken to ensure accuracy, reliability, timeliness and authenticity of the information; however Onlymyhealth.com does not take any liability for the same.

Among these is the concern that movement disorders, particularly parkinsonism, could increase in prevalence. Study: Viruses, parkinsonism and Parkinson’s disease: the past, present and future. Image Credit: sruilk/Shutterstock A new review published in the Journal of Neural Transmission attempts to summarize all known about the relationship between viral illness and parkinsonian disorders to facilitate further research. Introduction Movement disorders following a viral illness are among the most common types of secondary movement disorders, manifesting most frequently as dystonia in children and parkinsonism in adults. For instance, encephalitis lethargica and post-encephalitic parkinsonism emerged following the Spanish flu (influenza A H1N1) pandemic a hundred years ago. Parkinson’s disease (PD) has also been observed to result after influenza, herpes simplex, and hepatitis B and C infection. The pathophysiology of secondary PD is unknown, but it may be due to immediate or delayed damage to the neurons. Para- and post-infectious parkinsonism In the first scenario, para-infectious parkinsonism sets in within 15 days of the infection. This could be caused by the invasion of the nigrostriatal pathways by a neurotropic virus that invades and replicates within neurons, eventually causing their destruction. Such viruses could enter the central nervous system (CNS) along the nerves, by breaching the blood-brain barrier (BBB) or via the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB). Alternatively, indirect damage might be caused via inflammation with microglial activation. This leads to the production of inflammatory chemicals and T-cell activation. The resulting elevation in cytokine levels causes vascular injury, reducing oxygen supply to the neuronal tissue, causing hypoxic brain damage. Delayed or post-infectious parkinsonism may occur via autoimmunity, triggered by generalized immune activation or aberrant targeting of a specific host antigen by the host immune system. Such responses may result from molecular mimicry, as with herpes simplex, where host and viral antigens share similar structures, with resulting T and B cells activation against both. Another possible mechanism is bystander activation. Here the virus-activated T cells attack infected cells expressing viral peptides, causing the release of cytokines such as nitric oxide (NO), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), or lymphotoxin (LT). These kill not only the infected cell but nearby healthy cells as well – termed bystander killing. Alongside, the immune response begins to target not just the original peptides (epitopes) on the antigenic target but adjacent peptides as well, or even epitopes on other antigens. This “epitope spreading” results in a broader inflammatory response. Finally, chronic infection in the host leads to both epitope spreading and independent triggering of B and T cells, causing autoimmunity, prolonged immune activation, and chronic inflammation. Neurologic damage is more likely in this scenario. Examples Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) HIV is estimated to have infected almost 40 million people, prone to life-threatening opportunistic infections unless properly treated and maintained on highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART). This is characterized by the destruction of CD4 T cells specifically, and the levels of these lymphocytes are proportional to the viral load. Early CNS involvement is reported, with the virus entering the brain through infected white cells (the ‘Trojan horse’) or as free viral particles within infected endothelial cells. The virus then infects neurons as well as supporting glial cells. With HIV, parkinsonism appears early, fails to respond to standard treatment, and has unusual features, especially early prominent postural tremors. Marked injury to the basal ganglia may cause parkinsonism and other features of HIV-related encephalopathy. Akinetic rigidity is often precipitated by dopamine antagonists. With full-blown acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), the parkinsonism patient often also shows signs of dementia, seizures, and damage to the white matter as well as peripheral nerves. The prognosis is poor due to a distinctive and severe nigral degeneration. West Nile virus (WNV) Related StoriesLink between COVID-19 and long-term risk of autoimmune and autoinflammatory connective tissue disordersCurcumin compound reactivates Epstein–Barr virus, offering safer cancer therapySeasonal influenza adapted and evolved during the COVID-19 pandemicWNV has caused multiple outbreaks over the last 20 years, causing mild fever after an incubation period of 2 days to 2 weeks. In 1% of patients, acute neurologic symptoms manifest, such as meningitis or encephalitis, acute flaccid paralysis, and multiple movement disorders. Such patients are often elderly, alcohol addicts, or have a history of organ transplants. The route by which the virus enters the human brain is unknown but may be through a disrupted BBB in response to virus-induced inflammatory cytokines produced peripherally. Retrograde axonal transport or endothelial cell transport of the virus is also possible. Viral infection leads to neuronal death. Bilateral destruction of deep gray matter nuclei, especially the substantia nigra, for which the virus is specifically neurotropic, is probably responsible for parkinsonism in some patients. While most symptoms usually resolve spontaneously, the tremor may persist in one in ten cases, leading to disability. Japanese encephalitis B virus (JEV) Unlike other flaviviruses, JEV causes neurologic damage, including movement disorders, flaccid paralysis, or seizures, in many cases, resulting in lifelong disability. After the child is bitten by the Culex mosquito vector, the virus enters the circulation and infects the CNS via the endothelial cells of the CNS vasculature or through a disrupted inflamed BBB. Direct and inflammatory injury causes neuronal apoptosis in dopaminergic neurons of multiple brain regions, including the thalamus, basal ganglia, midbrain, and cerebellum. Both dopamine and norepinephrine transmission are disrupted, causing the characteristic movement disorders associated with JEV about 2-6 weeks after the acute encephalitic phase. JEV-related parkinsonism includes bradykinesia, rigidity, masked facies, and hypotonia, most of which resolve within 3 weeks except for a few patients who manifest a permanent loss of voice volume. Influenza Post-encephalitic parkinsonism (PEP) or encephalitis lethargica (EL) is a mysterious post-infectious phenomenon. Initially, it presented as an epidemic of neurologic impairment, with protean manifestations, including flu-like symptoms, sleepiness, issues with eye movements, and movement disorders in most cases. However, almost any kind of neurologic symptom may occur. The underlying damage appears to be diffuse brain atrophy, marked neuronal loss, and gliosis, affecting the substantia nigra, with neurofibrillary tangles. Many types of influenza A virus invade the nervous system after a systemic infection to infect the substantia nigra and hippocampus. This results in CNS inflammation with protein aggregates and degeneration in the dopaminergic pars compacta of the substantia nigra. Though this typically resolves, permanent microglial activation and neuroinflammation appear to persist, suggesting an autoimmune process. The interval from illness to PEP stretches over months to years, with akinetic rigidity being the most common presentation. Some cases responded to levodopa. Other post-viral parkinsonisms Coxsackie, Western equine encephalitis, Ebstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), poliovirus, and herpes simplex are also associated with parkinsonism. Meanwhile, other viruses have been linked to a higher risk of parkinsonian symptoms. Apart from PEP, H1N1 may cause α-synuclein aggregates to form by inhibiting autophagosome formation, contributing to protein misfolding. The α-synuclein epitope seems to be involved in most post-viral encephalopathies, probably via the suppression of autophagic mechanisms that normally clear away toxic protein debris and prevent neurodegeneration. Several studies have shown a higher risk of idiopathic PD after a diagnosis of influenza, supporting a contributing role of the virus. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is also associated with an increased risk of PD, though the link is unclear, and the PD risk may be due to liver disease rather than viral injury. This is borne out by the fact that non-alcoholic steatohepatitis is also a risk factor for PD. Other research showed severe inflammatory damage after HCV infection, possibly triggering PD. Dopaminergic disruption by altered transporter functioning is another possibility. With EBV, too, viral replication, BBB disruption, inflammation, and neuronal injury have all been implicated, while some suggest autoimmunity as the pathophysiologic mechanism. Parkinsonism and COVID-19 People with PD (PWP) often have respiratory limitations due to the rigidity of the chest wall musculature, hindering free breathing, as well as the abnormal posture and weakened cough reflex. This makes them more vulnerable to severe illness if they contract SARS-CoV-2. In fact, up to 40% of older PD patients die of the illness, especially those with a longer history of the disease and those who require ventilation or other devices during treatment. COVID-19 is also related to the post-COVID-19 worsening of muscular functions in PWP, in addition to the acute worsening described above. They may have to increase their anti-PD medication dosage and report brain fog, fatigue, poorer memory function, and sleep impairment. A few cases of parkinsonism arising after a SARS-CoV-2 infection have been documented without a prior family history. Most had encephalopathy preceding this feature, with a few responding to dopamine agonists. Hypoxia, hyperglycemia-triggered osmotic demyelination, and basal ganglia stroke were identified in other cases, while a few cases occurred while already on neuroleptics. These could possibly account for secondary parkinsonism. “However, with more than 5300 confirmed COVID-19 cases per 100,000 globally (as of February 2022) (Worldmeter.info 2021) and an annual incidence of about 15 PD cases per 100,000 (Tysnes and Storstein 2017), anticipating a parkinsonism wave based solely on the current 20 published cases sounds rather premature and susceptible to bias.” Further surveillance is necessary to catch such cases early and provide timely treatment in the coming years.

Table-tipping workshop with mediums Reverend Jane and Chris Howarth, Erie, Pennsylvania, 2014. Courtesy the artist What has happened to the more than one million people killed by the coronavirus in the United States since March of 2020? Their names are buried, in the san­itary custom of our country, inside a chart or a county coroner’s report. The first year of the pandemic saw public efforts to name and honor the individuals lost, but this generosity quickly ran out. Mourning has been relegated to the ephemeral no-place of social media, compressed into emoji-plated memorials that flit past in an instant. Now the absent presence of the dead is a problem only for their closest intimates. Democrats, Republicans, and a chorus of “apolitical” public health experts exhort us to get on with business, as though nothing bad is happening. In January of this year, the Centers for Disease Control director, Rochelle Walensky, cheered the public with the “really encouraging news” that most vaccinated people who died from COVID had four or more “comorbidities” and were thus “unwell to begin with.” Through canny arrange­ments of data, the dead are summoned to absolve the living—there’s no need to change course, or even to feel sorry. Disclosures of personal grief are met with demands for personal health infor­mation. Strangers on the internet need to know: were there preex­isting conditions? “Is it God’s way of thinning the herd?” asked a reality TV star, invoking the Malthusian intuition that sacrificing the “weak” is necessary and good. The refusal of collective mourning reveals whose deaths and what kinds of death we consider worthy of honor. Men who perish on the battlefields of a great war must be mourned by the nation, but the sick, whose suffering has no grand purpose, are a reminder that we can’t always control our bodies—knowledge best pushed into the shadows. None of this is new. In 2020, when Americans groped backward to the 1918 influenza pandemic in search of his­torical solace, they found little more than a cloud of amnesia: a marble bench in Barre, Vermont, is among the few scattered mon­uments to flu victims. Journalists mining medical history pried open the closed box of the 1918 flu and found certain resonances: the closure of schools and churches, a desperate shortage of doc­tors and nurses, a push for fresh air and ventilation. In contrast to COVID-19, at first depicted as a disease of the elderly and then recognized as disproportionately afflicting heavily exposed racial minorities and the poor, influenza hit hardest among healthy young people, the group most “valued” by society. Like today, the public looked frantically to medical science for answers, but local efforts to prevent gatherings, close schools, and require masking often cracked under political pressure. Medical experts vacillated, and businesses demanded relief. People were left alone to protect themselves, and to mourn, as their resources allowed. Faced with the bewildering devastation of World War I and the flu pandemic, many turned to Spiritualism, a nineteenth-century movement that promoted communication with the spirits of the dead. In early 1920, only a month after the last wave of influenza had passed, a West Coast writer complained about bad actors who were “‘cashing in’ on the epidemic.” By “epidemic,” he was refer­ring not to the disease itself but to “the spiritualistic and psychic craze” that followed on its heels. “A wave of spiritualistic investiga­tion is upon us,” reported a Chicago journal of the occult, pursued “by persons of cultivated intelligence as well as by unlettered and credulous followers.” Historians most often credit World War I for the resurgence of Spiritualism, but the flu’s dark cloud also looms large over the scene. Battlefield slaughter was inexorable; the ran­dom deaths of civilians left their families and friends haunted by survivor guilt. The war ended conclusively in victory parades and speeches, however hollow, but no one knew if the scourge of dis­ease would return. Through communion with the other world, mourners learned that their dearly departed were at peace—and they also sought the occult secrets of health that might protect them in the wake of modern medicine’s failure. Spiritualism was widespread in all walks of life, from seedy stage shows to the halls of Congress. Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of the eminently rational detective Sherlock Holmes, had been dabbling in this “new American religion” since the 1880s, long before losing both his son and brother to the flu. Doyle, like many others, believed channeling the dead was a scientific practice that proved the immortality of the soul. Spiritualism and detection were twin engines of consolation: they appeared to solve the mys­tery of death, absolving the innocent and condemning the guilty. Both of these practices worked on the individual rather than the societal level, restoring uniqueness and agency to people swept up in events of an inhuman scale. Through the technology of mediumship, the dead were within reach; their words of comfort could make things right. Spiritualists promised a world freed from mourning, but that did not mean a world freed from tragedy. What if easy consolation allows the conditions for tragedy to fester? in may of 1919, the president of the American Society for Psychical Research, James Hyslop, brought a woman he code-named “Mrs. Drew” to see the renowned medium Minnie Soule, known as “Mrs. Chenoweth.” He also brought a stenographer. Over the course of two months, Hyslop and his assistant recorded the medium’s every word as she muddled through the strange, disjointed signals that pulsed from the other world toward Mrs. Drew, a stolid woman who “does not appear to be of the highly imaginative type.” Despite Mrs. Drew’s opaque demeanor, the spirits laid bare at least one of her private griefs. During the sitting, the medium scrawled out a message from the spirit of a young woman: “I did not think…I would die did not want to go so soon.” Hyslop was there to enumerate and fact-check “correspon­dences” between Mrs. Chenoweth’s ramblings and Mrs. Drew’s family history. During the second sitting, the medium scrawled out a message from the spirit of a young woman: “I did not think…I would die did not want to go so soon.” Hyslop immediately recog­nized a correspondence. Mrs. Drew’s daughter had recently “died from influenza,” he commented in his report, “and just when they thought she might improve.” The medium dropped her pencil and cried out in distress. Mrs. Drew stood up and left. Hovering between trance and consciousness, Mrs. Chenoweth muttered, “I just see numbers, numbers. Do you know if anybody among these died with influenza. I just feel it. One of the victims of the scourge, I hear them say.” Based on “numbers” alone, Mrs. Chenoweth could have been making a likely guess as to recent events in Mrs. Drew’s life. Once Mrs. Drew responded to the suggestion that a daughter was con­tacting her and confirmed that the death was unexpected, the flu was the most logical culprit. In the shock of her first contact, we glimpse something dissonant and coldly impersonal, but in the sit­tings that followed, Mrs. Chenoweth dutifully homed in on the intimate consolation that all her visitors sought. The fundamental tenant of Spiritualism was that humans possess a unique and indi­visible self that persists after death; even in mass tragedies, such as the flu pandemic, the self is recovered in the singular perfection of heaven. Still, Mrs. Chenoweth’s cry of “numbers, numbers” feels eerily epidemiological; coming from some faceless chorus of the dead, it blocks the retreat into individual communion. For all the easy reassurance of the quaint and domestic heaven popularized in Spiritualist writings, the direct output of trances also shows a stranger, more frightening other world. As her sessions with Mrs. Drew unfolded, Mrs. Chenoweth hit upon further correspondences. Doctors had barraged the public with warnings that fatigue, stress, and fear could worsen the flu. Mrs. Drew’s daughter, married to a naval officer, spent much of the war anxiously knitting for the Red Cross. The family wondered if this frantic work had worn her down. Through Mrs. Chenoweth, the daughter assured them that being “overtired” was not what caused her to succumb. “I am glad I did as much as I did,” she said with patriotic pride. “I was not a slacker was I.” A meaningless and arbitrary death from disease was transformed into a good death though her honorable service to the nation. Both news reports and literary portrayals of spirit contact usu­ally featured nonbelievers who were converted by the stunning evidence of their senses. In Doyle’s 1926 novel, The Land of Mist, the skeptical hero, Dr. Challenger, finally converts to Spiritualism when two former patients from the charity ward contact him through a medium to reveal that they died from pneumonia, not from the experimental cure he had secretly dosed them with. For years, the doctor has carried the guilt of killing his patients, and the immense relief he feels when they absolve him wins him over to the Spiritualist cause. As a physician himself, Doyle recognized that many caregivers were tormented by failure and helplessness; he addressed his Spiritualist evangelism to them. Relieving sur­vivors’ guilt served an important purpose in the context of sense­less, relentless death. But the formula of individual forgiveness was often called upon to jump scales; its minute accounting of guilt and innocence also served a larger calculus of necessity, providing justi­fication to society as a whole for the suffering it refused to prevent. Shannon Taggart, Medium Sylvia Howarth Enters a Trance, England, 2013. Courtesy the artist As historian Christine Ferguson writes, Spiritualism’s con­cept of “free will” often amounted to embracing a utilitarian and biologically determined fate. The spirits of those at the top of the social hierarchy—able-bodied, white, and well-off—could affirm their noble choice to sacrifice themselves for the greater good. Those with inborn weakness or disability forgave society’s choice to sacrifice them, as they were in a “better and happier place.” If having the spirits of the “unfit” defend eugenics sounds monstrous, it is no more so than inspecting online photographs of COVID vic­tims to diagnose them with preexisting conditions. White medi­ums often ventriloquized People of Color, using their “voices” to justify the violent racial order that subjected them to exploitation and death. It is no coincidence that this practice, which produced apologetics for slavery and Indigenous genocide, was used again in 2020 to speak for George Floyd after his murder by Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin. A medium claiming to channel Floyd’s spirit preached “love and forgiveness” and discouraged political action. In contrast, many founders of the Spiritualist movement had an explicitly political vision of the dead crying out for justice. Spiritualism, which has always attracted antiestablishment radicals of various stripes, was a nexus of abolitionism and women’s rights in the 1850s and 1860s. Speeches by the spirits of abused slaves and repentant accommodationists strengthened the political will of abolition’s supporters. Labor agitators cited prophecies from the other world in their calls for equality and universal brother­hood. While reformers were drawn to the mass mobilizing power of spirit revelations, Spiritualism also appealed to a highly individ­ualized from of justice. The staunchly traditional Doyle was not alone in hoping that the dead might be able to assist the police. In a 1930 book, he assembled a litany of cases where crimes were solved via psychic visions. Indeed, the first messages ever received through the spirit telegraph in 1848 were supposedly from a mur­dered peddler buried in a basement. Such notorious incidents as the “Greenbrier Ghost” in West Virginia often involved women murdered by lovers or husbands, whose only hope for justice was posthumous. Together, Doyle’s popular ghost and detective stories anticipate today’s blockbuster true-crime shows, in which forensic experts are visionary mediums who make the dead speak—only to point to the police and carceral system as sources of redemption. in addition to offering emotional healing and political direc­tives, spirits from the other world were a prolific source of medi­cal advice. Spiritualism combated bodily weakness with confident prescriptions, rewriting illness as a matter of bad information and insufficient faith. Channeling doctors from beyond lent authority to women’s longstanding healing practices: Mrs. Augusta Messer of Milwaukee, a Prussian immigrant married to a carpenter, was credited with saving “more than eighty people during the influ­enza epidemic” through her mediumship. The spirits of chiroprac­tors, and of premodern physicians, prescribed “natural” remedies that were part of a broad countercultural rejection of mainstream medicine dating back to the early 1800s, when sundry folk healers offered alternatives to the aggressive bloodletting and purgatives of university-trained doctors. Throughout the nineteenth century, a struggle for authority raged between allopathic—mainstream—medicine and its heterodox detractors, who ranged from mesmer­ists to osteopaths to herbalists. Their critique of elite physicians was not without foundation: even after the germ theory of disease led to better prevention in the late nineteenth century, there was no magic bullet to combat germs inside the body, and allopathic doctors still resorted to harsh chemicals like mercury and sedatives like laudanum. Cheaper, gentler alternatives such as chiropractic took on populist appeal. Like many alternative healers, Riley blamed the pandemic on the unnat­ural tools of conventional medicine. Before influenza broke out in 1918, American doctors felt con­fident that they were winning the struggle for authority: the first effective antimicrobial drug had debuted in the 1910s, and state boards had formed to push out unlicensed healers and to shut down “inferior” medical schools—often under-resourced Black and women’s colleges. The pandemic assailed physicians’ new­found confidence; even the legendary “microbe hunters” who had captured tuberculosis and syphilis under the microscope could not identify the flu’s cause. Public health officials urged preven­tatives such as disinfecting hands and surfaces, but the absence of an evident pathogen left room for other explanations. In 1919, Joseph Shelby Riley, a chiropractor and founder of reflexology who preached “spinal adjustments” as a cure for the flu, boasted, “We have never had any trouble whatever in controlling the disease. When they were dying all around us by the thousand, we went to many of the worst cases…and saved all we treated.” Like many alternative healers, Riley blamed the pandemic itself on the unnat­ural tools of conventional medicine, specifically the new vaccine for typhoid fever. The false binaries of natural versus unnatural and pure versus contaminated held as much sway then as they do now, and sorted the world in equally inconsistent ways. Alternative healers gave credit to modern sanitation and hygiene for reducing the burden of acute disease, but only because they clung to the nineteenth-century miasma theory, which associated sickness with filth. The prolific chiropractor and nostrum-seller George Starr White held that “the germ theory is the product of a diseased mind and super­stition,” railing against vaccines on the grounds that “diseased and filthy matter is injected into the healthy body.” He preferred to treat patients with colored lights and essential oils, which he promised would “gri[p] the Flu out of Influenza.” “Nature’s laws are immutable laws,” declared White, “and…there is only one way of preventing and curing disease—the natural way.” Alternative medicine, Spiritualism, and occultism all tended to agree that cures were achieved not with antibodies but with ener­gies. They were informed by the mind-cure movement, a diffuse set of mind-over-matter therapeutics which, to varying degrees, rejected conventional medicine in favor of mental healing. Mary Baker Eddy, founder of Christian Science and a widely known proponent of mind cure, remarked of an 1895 flu outbreak, “Our great influenza epidemic is half mental or volitional, and largely depends upon fear for its victims.” The mind cure combated disease-inducing fear with healing faith, and shares a lineage with the positive-thinking philosophies that proliferated in twentieth-century America, promising wealth, health, and happiness to those who turned inward and harnessed their willpower. The belief that fear could cause disease was cruelly evident during the 1918-1919 pandemic. Even New York City’s health commissioner, a homeo­pathic doctor, delayed closing public venues in order to prevent “the condition of mind that in itself predisposes to physical ills.” The quiet after the storm of pandemic flu was filled with oblique dread. Teas, gargles, and lozenges peddled during the win­ter “danger months” bore ominous warnings: “Never make the mistake of underestimating the menace of a cold.” These nostrums, along with the proliferating self-help advice of positive thinking, promised to restore vigilant consumers’ control over their bodies. In 1920, the new-thought movement magazine Success criticized the U.S. surgeon general for predicting that influenza would recur and “may stay here for years.” Success did not deny the germ theory of disease but adopted a seed-and-soil philosophy: a sound mind and body would repel infection. “Take care of your health; don’t worry; keep cheerful and hopeful, and…you will resist any disease germs that may be floating around.” A natural-health guide con­curred with Success’s advice that each citizen had to “eliminate all fear of the flu,” underscoring that germs “multiply only in bodies heavily encumbered with and weakened by food, drink, and drug poisons”—which included vaccines. Like today’s wellness culture, this strain of popular thought addressed an audience that at least aspired to have enough time and money to buy “pure” products, live in large houses, and banish their worries. Countless charla­tans claimed to have saved every flu patient who came their way, rewriting the recent past when physicians had watched helplessly as thousands of formerly healthy young people succumbed. The seductive promise of individual control discounted effective med­ical and public health interventions that protected all Americans, including those who could not afford exotic lozenges. The same individualist fallacy, with its outsized focus on con­trolling subjective states of mind, shapes both mainstream and heterodox responses to COVID-19. Guidance from the CDC has repeatedly thrown out public health’s precautionary principle for fear of causing “panic.” Public health leaders incentivized desirable precautions, such as vaccines, with false promises of invulnerabil­ity—Biden’s “pandemic of the unvaccinated.” Some mental health experts rejected basic anticontagion measures, arguing that it is more important to keep disordered feelings at bay than to control the spread of pathogens. Doctors with no psychology background issued dire and unfounded warnings about the cost of masks to children’s development, while minimizing the dangers of the dis­ease itself. Another tragedy of medical authorities and pundits clos­ing ranks around a mind-over-matter approach to the pandemic is that the growing population of long-COVID sufferers have their symptoms dismissed as psychological—caused by mental weak­ness and hysteria. And promoters of mind cure and “the natural way” are still here to profit from desperation. This is not only the province of liberal-seeming wellness brands like GOOP, with its holistic long-COVID detox products. For right-wing conspir­acy groups, there is nothing contradictory about calling COVID a deep-state hoax while peddling immune-boosting vitamins and snake-oil antivirals. Telling the public that fear is worse than material threats to their lives—that fear is the “real” threat, and the reality of death and disability an illusion—is a terrifying refusal of political responsibility. spiritualism provided a distinctive new infrastructure for after­life communication. Its arc was not apocalyptic: it did not antici­pate an end of days when all souls would depart for heaven or hell. It rejected original sin and the mortification of the flesh. Instead, Spiritualists believed the veil between worlds had been lifted so that spirits could guide the Earth toward a utopian age of peace and plenty. All utopias, and the means of their arrival, reflect the values of those who conjure them. Some mediums promoted enlightened progress; others advocated political upheaval. There were strident materialists, railing against the exploitation of industrial workers and the “ever encroaching power of wealth.” What they all shared was the metaphysical belief that heaven is a purified version of this world; therefore, death was also progress. Death was often equated with freedom, and some insisted on “spiritual birthdays” instead of funerals. “No tears of sorrow for the dead,” implored the pop­ular medium Cora Richmond, “but all these for the living.” While Richmond meant to shine a light on social problems, this exalted rhetoric misses the point of mourning. When we mourn the dead, we mourn for ourselves, because we are not separate from them. We acknowledge what is at stake in building movements that push on without a utopian horizon. Now, I feel a shudder of dread when I hear the mantra, so foundational to Spiritualism, that death is not real. By the turn of the twentieth century, the intractability of worldly problems drove a further retreat into the occult and mag­ical. Initiates declared that “Man is a spirit here and now”—that those who mastered the secret powers of the mind could sculpt reality itself. Interviewed by one of her critics, a medium claimed to see “no reason why a person cannot be under water a long time and yet live”; people die, she insisted, only “because of the igno­rance which you still entertain regarding natural laws.” Her critic sarcastically retorted that if we follow this line of thought, then “a man thoroughly mangled in a railway accident dies because we believe that life has become impossible to him.” The year was 1919, and more than 500,000 Americans were dead from the flu, but wellness gurus suggested that perhaps they had succumbed to an illusion. The impulse to blame the dead was unsurprising in the context of prevailing American attitudes toward sickness, disability, and death, which had long scrutinized individual character rather than social structures. Knowing that I study the history of Spiritualism and the occult, friends started asking me at the beginning of the pandemic if we would see a revival of these practices in response to mass death, as occurred after the Civil War, World War I and the influenza pandemic, and World War II. The Times (of London) delivered the requisite story on a COVID-driven “21st-century revival of spiritualism.” CNN explored “after death communications” from pandemic victims. The New York Times ran a lifestyle piece about the boom in online psychic services, characteristically blaming stress and anxiety while avoiding any mention of grief. Repeating the old formula that people turn to Spiritualism to cope with tragedy fails to engage with the politics of life and death that have always been part of constructing the afterlife. Spiritualism and adjacent mind-cure philosophies often promoted individual survival and empowerment alongside a discourse of consolation and necessity. As an unchecked pandemic slashes through a society already wracked by climate change, exploitation, and hallucinatory self-help regimens, consolation for what’s been lost doubles as preemptive consolation for a stolen future. “Life on earth isn’t our ultimate end,” tweeted National Review columnist Alexandra DeSanctis in the spring of 2020, suggesting that there was no moral sense in trying to control COVID-19’s spread. The editor of a Christian magazine chided those who “value earthly above eternal life.” “There are more important things than living,” the lieutenant governor of Texas told reporters. In his estimation, the main thing more important than living was the sanctified “American way of life,” defined as economic productivity. As a his­torian, I had always withheld judgment about the promises made by Spiritualist practitioners. Now, I feel a shudder of dread when I hear descriptions of heaven as a happier continuation of this life, or the mantra, so foundational to Spiritualism, that death is not real. In the year 2022, the leaders of the United States have openly declared that the disabled are better off dead, that the working class prefers to be sacrificed to sustain the national economy, and that fear is worse than the morbidity and mortality caused by the novel coronavirus. Anthropologist Martha Lincoln calls this stance necrosecurity: the principle that “mass death among less grievable subjects plays an essential role in maintaining social welfare and public order.” For the right wing, the less grievable are the eugeni­cally “unfit” and the racialized, while for Democrats they are people who brought it on themselves by failing to get vaccinated. Each party maintained that only the unworthy would be sacrificed. In May 2020, The New York Times called a hundred thousand deaths “An Incalculable Loss”; two years later that newspaper marked nine hundred thousand deaths with the notorious headline “Many Americans Move On.” Buffered by their demographic isolation from those who have not “moved on,” a group of elites insists not merely that this pandemic defies human agency but also that it is no longer a problem at all. The thing their cohort most grieved was “normalcy,” which they seem to have willed back to life. This zombie normalcy can produce only more disposable people, as repeated COVID-19 infections create preexisting conditions that justify premature death. Of course, the living need some consolation. There are many ways to confront indelible loss, but the American approach has a strange violence to it: we have to accept what happened as inev­itable and push away our heightened awareness of death to keep our own heads above the perilous waters. When the flu struck in 1918, there was no virology and no bureaucratic state apparatus of disaster planning. Today we have ways of preserving life never previously imagined. We pray at the altar of lifesaving technolo­gies, but their dramatic power obscures the accounting methods that drive us to that altar in desperation. Careful wagers have been placed on how much damage people can absorb in the course of producing value. A great optimizing engine winnows down good subjects for the state and capital. We live under a dogma of indi­vidual responsibility; the heretics are easily spotted because they are poor, nonwhite, sick, or disabled. These souls can be pitied, but not mourned. As much as I believe that the dead should be allowed to speak, I don’t think they can tell us anything about ourselves that we don’t already know. There are no secrets or mysteries at this moment. We don’t even need the spirits to reveal the killer. Powerful tech­nology and tremendous resources were at America’s disposal, and instead of using them effectively, leaders preferred to let “nature’s laws” operate. The problem is that nature’s laws are also human creations, mystified and unleashed in bad faith. With their vaster purview, the dead can see this, and we can’t ask them for con­solation in advance as we continue to stack up bodies in service to a necrotic ideology. Communion between worlds takes many forms: the practice of Spiritualist mediumship often lends itself to private resolutions, but something larger and more terrible—Mrs. Chenoweth’s “numbers, numbers”—has been let loose and will never be resolved. Spiritualists envisioned a world freed from mourning, and we can see that desire darkly manifested in our present world where no magnitude of disaster can stop the busi­ness of the day. More tragedy becomes inevitable when an entire society refuses to imagine that things could have been otherwise. If there is a higher nature, it consists in recognizing that the lives of others are equal to our own, worth fighting for to the bitter end and beyond it.

But it wasn’t the flu virus that caused the majority of these deaths.An analysis of lung samples collected during that flu pandemic indicated that most of the deaths were likely due to bacterial pneumonia, which ran rampant in the absence of antibiotics. Even in more recent history, like the 1957 H2N2 and 2009 H1N1 flu pandemics, nearly 18 percent of patients with viral pneumonia had additional bacterial infections that increased their risk of death. And the COVID-19 pandemic is no different.With yet another flu season fast approaching in the midst of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, lessening the harm caused by these viruses is important to prevent deaths and reduce infections. However, many deaths associated with the flu and COVID-19 don’t occur at the hand of the virus alone. Instead, it’s a secondary bacterial infection that is often at the root of the devastating consequences attributed to an initial viral infection.I am an immunologist who studies why and how cells die during bacterial and viral infections. Understanding the synergy between these microbes is critical not only for effective diagnosis and treatment but also for managing current pandemics and preventing future ones. My colleagues and I published a study showing how an immune system protein crucial to fighting against viruses also plays an indispensable role in fighting bacteria.Viruses and bacteria team upMultiple pathogens can cause multiple infections in different ways. Scientists distinguish each type based on the timing of when each infection occurs. Coinfection refers to two or more different pathogens causing infections at the same time. Secondary or superinfections, on the other hand, refer to sequential infections that occur after the initial infection. They’re often caused by pathogens resistant to antibiotics used to treat the primary infection.How viral and bacterial infections interact with each other increases the potential harm they can cause. Viral respiratory infections can increase the likelihood of bacterial infections and lead to worse diseases. The reason why this happens is often multifaceted.Within your respiratory tract, the epithelial cells lining your airways and lungs serve as the first line of defense against inhaled pathogens and debris. However, viruses can kill these cells and disrupt this protective barrier, allowing inhaled bacteria to invade. They can also change the surface of epithelial cells to make them easier for bacteria to attach to.Viruses can also alter the surface of epithelial and immune cells by reducing the number of receptors that help these cells recognize and mount a response against pathogens. This reduction means fewer immune cells report to the viral infection site, giving bacteria an opening to launch another infection.Influenza, Covid-19, and bacterial infectionsPatients who have a bacterial infection at the same time they’re battling the seasonal flu are more likely to wind up in a hospital. Nearly a quarter of patients admitted to the ICU with severe influenza also have a bacterial infection. One study on the 2010 to 2018 flu seasons found that nearly 20 percent of patients admitted to the hospital with flu-associated pneumonia had acquired bacterial infections.Another study of patients hospitalized with viral or bacterial infections found that nearly half had coinfection with another pathogen. These patients also had nearly double the risk of dying within 30 days compared to those with only a single infection.Interestingly, the two bacteria species most commonly involved in coinfections with the influenza virus are Streptococcus pneumonia and Staphylococcus aureus, which normally exist in the respiratory tract without causing disease. However, the influenza virus can damage the cell barrier of the lungs and disrupt immune function enough to make patients susceptible to infection by these otherwise benign bacteria.Secondary bacterial infections are also exacerbating the Covid-19 pandemic. A 2021 review estimated that 16 to 28 percent of adults hospitalized for Covid-19 also had a bacterial infection. These patients stayed in the hospital for twice as long, were four times more likely to need mechanical ventilation, and had three times greater odds of dying compared to patients with only Covid-19.Addressing secondary and coinfectionsThe immune system responds differently to viruses and bacteria. Antivirals don’t work on bacteria, and antibiotics don’t work on viruses. A better understanding of what pathways the body uses to regulate both antiviral and antibacterial infections is critical to addressing secondary and coinfections.Recent work by my colleagues and me may provide a clue. We sequenced the RNA of one type of immune cell, macrophages, in mice to identify what molecules were present in cells that were either protected from or died due to bacterial infection.We identified Z-DNA binding protein (ZBP1), a molecule already known to play a regulatory role in how the immune system responds to influenza. Specifically, ZBP1 detects influenza viruses within the lungs and signals infected epithelial and immune cells to self-destruct. This induced cell death eliminates the virus and promotes the recruitment of additional immune cells to the infection site.Building off this finding that ZBP1 is important for fighting viral infection, we found that macrophages infected with Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, a type of bacteria that causes foodborne illness, also use this protein to initiate cell death. This limits bacterial replication while also sending inflammatory signals that help clear bacteria.These findings raise the possibility that ZBP1 may play a dual role in how the body responds to viral and bacterial infections. It’s possible that treatments that increase ZBP1 in certain types of cells may be useful in managing bacterial and viral infections.This article was originally published in The Conversation by Hayley Muendlein at Tufts University.

NewsisVulnerable groups advised to receive both flu and updated COVID-19 vaccinesBy Lee Hyo-jin A "twindemic" ― a severe flu season occurring at the same time as an increase in coronavirus cases, possibly overwhelming healthcare systems ― is likely to occur in Korea this coming flu season, according to local medical experts, amounting to a worrisome scenario. Influenza, commonly known as the flu, is a contagious respiratory disease caused by a family of viruses that infect the nose, throat and even lungs in serious cases. Common symptoms of the illness include a high fever, cough and sore throat.Each year, the country grapples with a flu season which usually begins at the end of November, reaches its peak in December and lasts until as late as April.It is not the first time since the COVID-19 outbreak in early 2020 that experts have warned about a possible twindemic.But Korea has so far avoided such a double whammy of viral infections. Thanks to COVID-19-induced measures such as required face masks, social distancing rules, enhanced personal hygiene and working from home, the flu seasons of 2021 and 2020 were unusually mild.However, this year is likely to be different, experts warn. Prime Minister hints at ending pre-arrival COVID-19 tests before Chuseok holiday 2022-08-30 15:45 | Health & Science "The number (of flu patients) is rising already. It could be the beginning of a typical flu season, or a more severe one, considering that people haven't been building up immunity against the virus in the past couple of years," Kim Woo-joo, an infectious disease specialist at Korea University Guro Hospital, told The Korea Times.And now that the government has eased many social distancing measures, the number of flu cases is likely to bounce back to pre-pandemic levels, he added. According to weekly information from the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA), in the third week of August, 4.2 out of 1,000 visitors to hospitals were reported to have influenza-like symptoms, up from 3.7 in the previous week.A child receives a flu vaccine at a local clinic in Songpa District, Seoul, Sept.14, 2021. Korea Times photo by Wang Tae-sukThis figure is the highest for that period in five years, after 5.2 out of 1,000 people were reported to have flu-like symptoms in the second week of August in 2017. Kim said Korea should look at the flu trends in Australia, where it is currently winter, for possible indications of the upcoming the flu season for countries in the Northern Hemisphere. Australia has been grappling with its worst flu season in five years, with 216,725 reported cases and 273 fatalities, as of Aug. 14. Children aged under 9 were hit hardest among other age groups, according to Australian health authorities. "Australia's flu season typically spans from June to September, but this year, it started in April. Our government should take preemptive steps and concurrently roll out flu shots and updated COVID-19 vaccines to vulnerable groups in the coming weeks," said Kim.Bivalent COVID-19 vaccines on the wayThe KDCA, which anticipates another huge wave of COVID-19 infections to arrive in late fall at the earliest due to waning immunity among the population here from vaccinations or prior infections, plans to roll out booster shots specifically targeting the Omicron variant.The agency will announce on Wednesday detailed plans for the procurement of the updated vaccines and inoculation. The Ministry of Food and Drug Safety is currently reviewing authorizing bivalent vaccines developed by Pfizer and Moderna that target both the BA.1 subvariant of Omicron as well as the original strain of the coronavirus. Upon approval, the doses are expected to be used for second boosters on recipients currently eligible for a fourth shot ― people aged 50 and over, those aged 18 and over with underlying diseases, as well as residents and workers in nursing homes and other vulnerable facilities. lhj@koreatimes.co.kr More articles by this reporter Most Read in National 1Korea to launch economic consultative bodies to brace for Trump 2.0 22 umbrella unions stage large-scale rallies in Seoul 3Concerns grow over AI textbooks as digital dependence increases among students 4Yoon grapples with growing unpopularity at halfway mark 5Fire erupts at POSCO Pohang plant; 1 worker injured Top 10 Stories 1Korea to launch economic consultative bodies to brace for Trump 2.0 2Korean essay on 'ramyeon' to be published in UK 3Ukraine reveals intercepted radio communications of NK soldiers in Russia 4Trump speaks to Putin, warns against escalating in Ukraine: report 5Fencer Oh Sang-uk, chef Edward Lee to receive 2025 Korea Image Awards 6Putin finalizes N.

By Gabriella Sotelo Published August 30, 2022 | Comments (0) | ð Copied! Photo: tamara321 (Shutterstock) Over 100 black vultures were found dead on the Sussex Branch Trail in Lafayette, Sussex County, New Jersey. The deaths have apparently been occurring since early August, and avian influenza (also known as bird flu) was the confirmed cause of death. In a statement, New Jersey Fish and Wildlife said that black vultures seem to be very susceptible to bird flu. The reason, their innate tendency to scavenge. For this case in Sussex County, the vultures would scavenge on the carcasses of previously infected dead vultures, which can then prolong the outbreak of the flu since the scavenger would continue to prey upon infected birds or animals. These vultures have been left to decompose on site due to ârough terrain causing accessibility issues and a lack of personnel in the state to handle infected birds,â as reported in the NJFW statement. The environmental agency also mentioned that improper handling of the carcasses can lead to further spread of the virus. Gizmodo reached out to the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection regarding more birds scavenging on these carcasses, but at time of publication, havenât heard back. The trail these birds were found on will be closed until further notice. âBird fluâ is caused by infection with avian (bird) influenza (flu) Type A viruses. This virus occurs naturally among wild aquatic birds and can infect other bird and animal species, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Recently, thereâs been surging cases of a dangerous strain of the virus in the United States thatâs caused millions of birds to die. âAround 700 black vultures died after contracting the bird flu at a sanctuary in Georgia, which then caused the sanctuary to euthanize almost 30 other birds. In Maryland, officials are reporting that more than 100 black vultures have died from the virus this year, maybe more, but a total count isnât possible because the birds can get infected and die where people are unable to find them. Chances of the bird flu being transmitted to people are extremely low. The CDC states that there have been rare cases of human infection with some bird viruses, and when people were infected it was most often due to close or lengthy contact with the infected bird. As for the case of the black vultures dead in New Jersey, The New Jersey Department of Agriculture and NJFW said that they are monitoring the situation.

Cold & FluDo You Need a High-Dose Flu Shot?Health experts are urging people 65 and up to get a flu shot specifically designed for older adults. Here’s how these vaccines can keep you out of the hospital and possibly save your life.ByBecky UphamMedically ReviewedbyGrant Chu, MDPublished on August 29, 2022As you age, your immune system gets tired — but an extra-potent flu vaccine can wake it up.Getty ImagesThe flu vaccine is the best way to protect against the flu, which is why the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone 6 months of age and older (with rare exceptions) get a flu shot every year.U.S. health experts anticipate a challenging flu season ahead now that mask mandates and other COVID-19 protections — measures that had the added benefit of driving down flu rates to historic lows — have largely disappeared. The right flu vaccine can help keep you from getting infected or experiencing potentially serious complications.If you’re an older adult, this annual flu shot is especially important. In past flu seasons, 70 to 85 percent of flu-related deaths and 50 to 70 percent of flu-related hospitalizations occurred in people age 65 years and older.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved two flu-vaccine types specifically for people 65 and up: higher-dose vaccines and adjuvanted (amped-up) standard-dose vaccines. But in years past the CDC did not suggest that seniors opt for one of those vaccines; instead, the agency recommended any licensed, age-appropriate flu vaccine, with no preference for one kind over any other.The CDC changed its position earlier this year. It now recommends that, when possible, seniors choose a higher-dose flu vaccine (Fluzone High-Dose or the egg-free Flublok recombinant) or an adjuvanted standard-dose flu vaccine (Fluad) over other types. If these vaccines aren’t available, the CDC recommends getting a regular standard-dose vaccine.“Given their increased risk of flu-associated severe illness, hospitalization, and death, it’s important to use these potentially more effective vaccines in people 65 years and older,” said José R. Romero, MD, the director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, in a statement.He added that the new CDC recommendations are especially noteworthy for Black, Latino, and Asian seniors, who researchers have found are less likely than white seniors to get these extra-protective vaccines.Read on to learn more about the ideal flu vaccines for people 65 and older, including when to get the shot and what side effects to expect.What Do People 65 and Over Need to Know About the Flu Shot?Adults 65 and up may not mount as strong an immune response to a standard flu vaccine as younger people, which is why they should seek out a high-potency shot. Purvi S. Parikh, MD, of NYU Langone Health explains.Next up video playing in 10 seconds1. The 65-and-Up Flu Shots Can ‘Wake Up’ a ‘Tired’ Immune SystemAs is true with all vaccines, standard-dose flu vaccines become less effective the older you get, according to Gregory Poland, MD, an internal medicine doctor at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. “The immune system gets ‘tired,’ so to speak — that’s called immunosenescence,” says Dr. Poland.Higher-dose or adjuvanted standard-dose vaccines are designed to stimulate the flagging immune systems of older adults. Compared with standard-dose (inactivated) flu vaccines, higher-dose flu shots contain four times the amount of antigen — the part of the vaccine that stimulates the immune system to produce protective antibodies.2. The 65-and-Up Flu Shots Can Stave Off Infection, Serious Illness, and DeathEvery flu season is different, so predicting the efficacy of any flu shot in a given year is difficult. Still, studies have shown that in seniors, the higher-dose and adjuvanted standard-dose flu vaccines can prevent more infections and save lives compared with standard-dose flu shots, says Paul Auwaerter, MD, the clinical director of the division of infectious diseases at Johns Hopkins Medicine in Baltimore.The data is best for the higher-dose vaccine, which in one study showed itself to be 24 percent better at preventing the flu in people 65 and older than the standard-dose vaccine, says Poland.The higher-dose vaccine also appears to be more effective than the standard-dose vaccine at keeping people who do get the flu out of the hospital. In a study conducted during the 2013–14 flu season of more than 38,000 residents in 823 nursing homes in 38 states, people 65 and older who got the Fluzone High-Dose vaccine had a lower risk of hospital admission than people in that age group who got the Fluzone standard dose; this was especially true for residents of long-term care facilities.“Both those studies were done with what’s called a trivalent vaccine — it covered two A strains and one B strain [of the influenza virus],” says Dr. Auwaerter. The higher-dose vaccine for the 2022–23 flu season will be quadrivalent, covering four flu strains, 2A and 2B, he explains. There will be no trivalent vaccine available for the upcoming flu season, per the CDC.A study published in July 2020 in the Journal of Infectious Diseases found that both the Fluzone High-Dose and Fluad (adjuvanted standard-dose) vaccines performed about the same in preventing the flu and flu-related hospitalizations among older adults. 7 Flu Shot Myths You Should Stop BelievingNo, the flu shot can’t give you the flu. Here’s a look at the (many!) misconceptions people have about the flu vaccine.Next up video playing in 10 seconds3. The 65-and-Up Flu Shots Are Safe and Have Only Mild Side Effects, if AnySeniors who get the higher-dose or adjuvanted standard-dose flu shots are more likely to report side effects than people who get the standard dose. Still, most people had either no side effects or mild ones that included pain or redness at the injection site, headache, muscle aches, and malaise (feeling blah).Poland reports that he has received both the standard-dose flu shot and the higher-dose shot. Based on his experience, he doesn’t think that most people will register much of a difference when it comes to side effects.He notes that it’s safe to get the COVID-19 vaccine or booster at the same time as any type of flu shot, including the higher-dose flu shot.Some research published in JAMA Network Open in July of this year suggests you’re more likely to have (generally mild) side effects if you get a COVID-19 booster and a flu shot simultaneously, so if that’s a concern, you may opt to space them out a bit.4. The 65-and-Up Flu Shots Have a Track Record — and Are Covered by MedicareEven though the CDC is just now recommending the 65-and-up flu shots over the standard-dose flu shots, these vaccines aren’t a new thing: They've been around for years, says Poland.If you are hearing about the higher-dose shot for the first time from your pharmacist or healthcare provider, it may be simply because this is the first year that the CDC is preferentially recommending it, along with the other vaccines designed for people 65 and older.“That’s because they have determined that the efficacy is superior, and there’s a good enough supply to recommend it,” says Poland. These types of vaccines are a little pricier than standard-dose vaccines, although Medicare will cover the cost for enrollees, he says.Bottom Line: Any Flu Vaccine You’re Eligible for Is Better Than No Vaccine “If you list them in order of preference, my first choice would be to get the high-dose vaccine; the next would be the recombinant or adjuvanted vaccine, and the last choice would be to get the standard dose vaccine — but remember, something is better than nothing,” Poland says.That’s also what the CDC advises: If you’re 65 or older and can’t find a place that administers higher-dose flu shots or adjuvanted standard-dose shots, go ahead and get the regular standard-dose vaccine.A flu shot has benefits even beyond lowering your risk of hospitalization or death as a result of the flu. For instance, “In people 65 or older, the benefit of getting the flu vaccine in preventing a heart attack is equal to taking a daily aspirin, taking a beta-blocker, or stopping smoking,” says Poland.Get the High-Dose Flu Shot in September or OctoberYou can get the flu shot anytime flu viruses are circulating, but timing your shot well will give you the maximum level of protection at the peak of flu season, which is typically between December and February. Keep in mind it takes about two weeks after vaccination for antibodies to develop and provide protection.Because immunity may decrease more quickly in older people, it is especially important that people 65 and older not get vaccinated too early. September and October are generally good times, per the CDC. If you miss that window, it still makes sense to get vaccinated.If you want to increase your chance of getting a flu shot designed for people 65 and up, call your primary care provider, local health department, or pharmacy before scheduling your appointment.Meet Our ExpertsSee Our Editorial PolicyMeet Our Health Expert NetworkGrant Chu, MDMedical ReviewerGrant Chu, MD, is an assistant clinical professor at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA.

MORE: American bison at Cape May County Zoo gives birth to her first calfThe birds have been housed indoors since April amidst the spread of HPAI. The hope in moving the species indoors was that it would cut off contact between wild birds and zoo animals, and therefore limit the spread of the disease.During these months, the zoo's animal care and veterinary teams have been closely monitoring cases among wild birds along the Atlantic flyway, a major North American route for spring and fall migrations. In Pennsylvania, HPAI was detected in wild birds as well as commercial flocks."Everything that we do at the Philadelphia Zoo revolves around the well-being of the animals in our care," Dr. Donna Ialeggio, the zoo's Director of Animal Health, said in a release. "We make science-based decisions about the management of animal health and safety that must be able to evolve as situations change. We are very happy that based on our ongoing HPAI assessments, we are now able to return many of our birds to their preferred Zoo habitats." View this post on Instagram A post shared by Philadelphia Zoo (@philadelphiazoo) People visiting the zoo who are eager to see their beloved bird species again, after all this time, can check out the Humboldt penguins in Penguin Point and the Caribbean flamingos in Bird Valley.Birds of prey, such as bald eagles, vultures, barn owls and caracaras, will continue to be protected and housed indoors. This particular strain of HPAI appears to cause more severe disease in wild birds of prey than other species. Parts of the walk-through exhibits in McNeil Avian Center and Wings of Asia will also remain closed to guests.The zoo is working on modifications to existing outdoor exhibits to allow for the safe return of the birds of prey, and will monitor the existence of HPAI in wild birds as the fall migration approaches.

Avian influenza (bird flu) is a virus that can spread directly (ie through contact) or indirectly (ie through faeces) between birds. It is potentially transmissible to humans although the risk of this is very low. Because it is so transmissible between birds however, it is classed as a notifiable disease, which means that any cases have to be reported to the Department of Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs (Defra).How did a zoo bird get bird flu?As visitors will be well aware, Paignton Zoo is located in a lush, wooded river valley that provides a haven for countless wild animals. This means that wild birds frequently visit or set up home, which in turn means that any diseases that are present in the local wild bird population can potentially find their way into the zoo. Although many of our birds are in enclosed aviaries or indoor exhibits, some of them are kept in larger, open areas (such as the lake) or in the case of our peafowl, roam freely around the site. The most likely way that our birds caught the avian influenza virus is through unfortunate contact with an infected wild bird.How big a problem is bird flu?Bird flu poses a very serious risk to both wild and captive bird populations, and this risk is increasing every year. Already this year, there have been more than 5 x as many outbreaks as there were in the whole of 2021 and scientists suggest that this is the worst outbreak of the disease ever seen in the UK. In previous years, bird flu tended to be seasonal, appearing occasionally over the winter period. This year however, the disease has never really gone away and cases have been reported in all seasons.Bird flu spreads easily amongst birds when they are in close contact. This is why it is such a serious concern for poultry farms, and is also why there have been such devastating outbreaks around the UK in seabird colonies. It’s not just the UK where this is happening, substantial outbreaks have also occurred in other countries, in both wild and captive settings.What measures have been implemented?The work we have been doing with the the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) and Defra has been to make sure we have suitable measures in place to prevent any further spread of the disease within the zoo. This has meant the introduction of additional biosecurity across the zoo site, as well as the construction of new quarantine and isolation facilities to allow us to separate and monitor those birds deemed to be particularly at risk Most notably from a visitor perspective, people will see that we have had to remove our captive birds from the main lake, and we no longer have peafowl free roaming around the zoo. The main reason for this is that these birds were in regular contact with wild birds, and it will have been these wild birds that brought the bird flu infection onto the site.Have birds been culled?Because it is such a serious disease, affected birds are required to be humanely culled. At this point in time, we are working on confirming which birds APHA and Defra consider as affected.What does it mean for the zoo?Bird flu is a problem that will never go away completely so it’s a challenge that we will have to contend with as we move forwards, and in fact we were already making changes at the zoo before this outbreak. One of the reasons we removed the Brookside aviary and added the new lakeside pathway was because we had a main visitor path running through an aviary. Our new entrance means that visitors can now enter the zoo even if we have to close an aviary for precautionary measures. Our long term plans for how the zoo changes and develops will be influenced by the need to ensure that our birds are not at risk from diseases from outside.It also affects our conservation work outside the zoo gate. Alongside habitat loss and the climate crisis, disease poses a huge risk for wildlife populations, so our field projects in the UK and overseas are also likely to be impacted.How can people help?We have been overwhelmed by the many messages of support that we have received this week. They mean a great deal to us and we look forward to being able to report more positive news soon.We have had numerous offers of practical help, and we would like to say a huge thank you to everyone that has offered to assist. Unfortunately, the biosecurity and quarantine measures that we are implementing mean that we can only allow experienced and essential staff on site at this time. If you would like to look at offering your time to the zoo in the future, contact our Volunteer Manager Hazel.Other people have offered to make donations to the zoo and we again say a huge thank you to those that have done so. The summer holidays are a vital period for the zoo in terms of income and the fact that we have had to close for the last week of the summer season has had a significant impact on our revenue. As a conservation charity, we do not receive any government support to fund our zoo or our conservation projects and it is inevitable that this knock to our finances will impact our plans for the coming year.

It is our shared responsibility to eradicate polio globally.“Everyone who is not vaccinated, or whose children have missed their scheduled vaccinations, should seek vaccination as soon as possible.”WHO officials also said there are early signs the monkeypox outbreak is slowing.But they stressed the virus can cause “agonising” symptoms as they urged ongoing action to eliminate the virus in Europe.Sorry, we are not accepting comments on this article.Similar storiesGovernment stake in NatWest falls to 11.4% after bank buys back £1bn of sharesUK News|Just nowHeathrow records busiest ever OctoberUK News|Just nowWhat the papers say – November 11UK News|4 hours agoGovernment says it will not allow events to be ‘hijacked’ by antisemitismUK News|5 hours agoStarmer and Macron to discuss Ukraine ahead of Armistice commemorationsUK News|8 hours agoMost popular1Big projects at risk as P&R starts mini-BudgetNews|1 hour ago2Rotten eggs put in appeal collection binNews|20 hours ago3‘My Guernsey-born great-uncle deserves the Victoria Cross’News|2 hours ago4Les Beaucamps class sizes are fastest-growing of 11-16 schoolsNews|1 hour ago5Public get to see plans for Victor Huge CentreNews|1 hour agoFollow us onGet involvedSend Us Your NewsSubscribe to the Guernsey PressUseful linksAdvertise with usMaking a complaintGuernsey AirportGuernsey HarboursAbout the websiteAbout usContact usTerms of website usePrivacy PolicyAcceptable Use PolicyHomepageFollow us onTwitterFacebook Back to top© 2024 Guernsey Press.

IslandsTravelEducationVoicesCoronavirusCampaignsFeaturesMore CloseNewsSportWeatherServicesPodcastsJobsPropertyMotoringBiSiFamily NoticesPicture StorePride Of GuernseyDigital EditionsNewslettersRare wild birds among many species hit by ‘unprecedented’ avian flu outbreakThe Environment Department and Welsh Government publish new guidance on dealing with the impact of bird flu on wild birds.Published Aug 31, 2022Wild birds from threatened roseate terns, puffins and gannets to hen harriers are being hit by an “unprecedented” avian flu outbreak, officials have said.Bird flu has been found at scores of poultry farms and commercial premises across the UK in the past year, while the disease has also ripped through breeding colonies of seabirds, killing thousands in some sites.The Environment Department (Defra) and Welsh Government have set out new guidance to land managers, the public and conservation groups to curb the impact of bird flu in wild birds, while protecting health and the countryside.The National Trust, which has seen devastating outbreaks at sites it cares for such as the Farne Islands off the coast of Northumberland, welcomed the strategy, but warned much of the guidance was “too little, too late”.A dead seabird is among those cleared by the National Trust team on the Farne Islands (Owen Humphreys/PA)It also sets out the Government approach to monitoring and better understanding the spread of avian influenza in wild bird populations.Researchers have already received £1.5 million to develop new strategies to tackle outbreaks of bird flu.The current outbreak of H5N1 bird flu, which began in October last year, is being described by officials as “unprecedented in its scale and the breadth of species affected”.It is the longest and largest such outbreak on record in the UK, continuing beyond the normal winter period for the disease and hitting wild birds and breeding colonies of seabirds not normally affected.Monitoring by the Animal and Health Plant Agency in the outbreak has shown more than 1,500 found dead wild birds testing positive for the disease, recovered from more than 360 locations and including 61 species.In England, there are particular concerns over high levels of deaths at the only UK breeding colony of roseate terns on Coquet Island, Northumberland, and high mortality at amber-listed Sandwich tern breeding colonies in Northumberland and Norfolk.Concerns are also emerging over bird flu which has been confirmed in gannets on Grassholm Island off the Pembrokeshire coast in Wales.Officials warn that high levels of mortality caused by avian influenza could have serious impacts on England and Wales’s breeding seabird populations.Bird flu has has also been detected in other species in Britain where there are conservation concerns, including red-listed white tailed eagles, also known as sea eagles, and England’s most threatened bird of prey, the hen harrier.Defra biosecurity minister Lord Benyon said: “Our wild birds are facing exceptional pressures from avian flu this year and we have seen the tragic effect it has had – particularly on our seabird colonies.“I very much share concerns about the impact avian influenza is likely to have on breeding populations of wild birds in the future, particularly those that nest in large numbers and represent some of our rarer species.“We are funding a science programme to try and better understand how avian influenza is spreading in wild birds and today’s guidance will help land managers, ornithologists and the public manage some of the issues we are facing.”“Wales is home to the world’s largest colony of Manx shearwaters, the third largest gannet colony, as well as large colonies of other seabirds, such as auks, gulls and terns.“We will continue to closely monitor the ongoing situation and urge anyone who sees a dead bird to report it and not to touch it,” she said.Rosie Hails, director of science and nature at the National Trust, welcomed the strategy from Defra and Welsh Government, its acknowledgement of the impact of avian influenza on our seabird colonies, and the new stakeholder group to explore its impact further on our wild bird populations.Puffins are among the birds affected by the bird flu outbreak (Owen Humphreys PA)“The impact on our seabird colonies has been devastating with over 5,000 birds alone found dead on the Farne Islands off the coast of Northumberland which at the time weren’t able to be tested, and we believe these numbers to be sadly just the tip of the iceberg.”She said more work needs to be done to address the risk to the wider wild bird population heading into the autumn migration period, and more planning on how to support landowners if the disease spreads to mammals such as seals as the grey seal pupping season begins.Sorry, we are not accepting comments on this article.Similar storiesGovernment stake in NatWest falls to 11.4% after bank buys back £1bn of sharesUK News|Just nowHeathrow

By the end of July, the country had recorded 1,455 cases and 30 deaths, more than double the figures recorded for 2021. Tabassum Barnagarwala Aug 31, 2022 · 06:30 am Read in App An H1N1 flu screening centre in Ram Manohar Lohia hospital in New Delhi in August 2009. | Reuters Seventy-two people in Maharashtra have died from swine flu in the past three months. The viral infection, which is caused by the H1N1 virus, is seeing a resurgence in western India this year, with Maharashtra alone recording 1,870 cases till August 23. The caseload across India is likely to have crossed at least 2,800 so far this year, a threefold jump from the previous year. In contrast, H1N1 deaths for the entire country in 2021 stood at 12. Does the resurgence of the H1N1 virus have anything to do with Covid-19 on the verge of turning endemic or is the virus following a cyclic pattern? Scroll.in spoke to doctors and scientists to understand why H1N1 cases plunged during the past two years only to bounce back this year.A cyclic patternH1N1 is a viral infection with symptoms involving cold, fever, sore throat, body ache and headache. In severe cases, it leads to pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. The H1N1 pandemic first broke out in April 2009 and, unlike Covid-19, subsided quickly by 2010. The World Health Organization had declared the end of the H1N1 influenza pandemic by August 2010.Since then it has been endemic, occurring in the form of a seasonal flu. Epidemiologist Dr Jayaprakash Muliyil, chairperson of the Scientific Advisory Committee at the National Institute of Epidemiology, said that once 40% of the population had attained herd immunity in the 2009-’10 outbreak, the virus transmission slowed down.“Note that H1N1 is not as transmissible as coronavirus,” he said. “Each virus has a different threshold.” According to Muliyil, even though 60% of the population was unexposed, the number of H1N1 cases began rapidly declining. Swine flu made a reappearance in 2012, with a high number of cases in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Rajasthan. “Because the susceptibility to infection increased in the population over a period of time,” he said.Since then, H1N1 has maintained a cyclic pattern. Cases spike around monsoon and winter, with the monsoons recording a larger share of cases than winters in India. “Its susceptibility builds up over a year or two and then cases rise in the following year,” Muliyil said, explaining that herd immunity against the virus wanes.Before vaccination was rolled out, the measles epidemic too occurred once in two to three years, and rubella once in six to seven years. While a vaccine against influenza to prevent H1N1 was introduced in late 2009, its uptake in India remains low.In the last decade, H1N1 cases surged in 2015 then 2017 and then in 2019. Since the past two years, however, the number of H1N1 cases have been at an all-time low. Cases in India dropped from 28,798 in 2019 to 2,752 with 44 deaths in 2020. In 2021, there was a further decline to 778 cases and 12 deaths. But this year, cases are rising again. Data provided by the National Centre for Disease Control for H1N1 till June 30 showed that India recorded 424 cases and 12 deaths in the first half of this year. By July-end, the figure rose to 1,455 cases. At least 17 deaths were recorded in July alone. Trends indicate these figures are expected to rise further in August.Gujarat and Karnataka are also seeing a rising trend in cases. In 2021, Karnataka had recorded 13 cases but as of July-end, it had 283 cases of H1N1. Gujarat had recorded 33 cases in 2021 and by July-end this year it had 205 cases.

Covid-19 effect?Some medical experts say the lull in H1N1 over the past two years may have been related to the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic in early 2020. For one, Covid-19 appears to have diverted testing resources, which may have led to an underdetection of swine flu cases.But some medical experts believe Covid-19 may have contributed to low H1N1 circulation as well. Dr Rajesh Karyakarte, Professor and Head of Microbiology Department at BJ Government Medical College, said whenever Covid-19 waves rose, other viruses “sort of disappeared”.“We saw this with all the three waves,” he said. “Now that Covid-19 is ebbing, H1N1 rise is not surprising.” According to Karyakarte, when a virus infects a person, the body releases interferons. These are signalling proteins released by the body’s immune system to fight infection and other diseases.Karyakarte noted that Covid-19, due to its high transmissibility, infected almost the entire population. “When an H1N1 virus tried to infect the same person, the interferons would respond making it difficult for H1N1 to cause infection,” he said.Dr Pradeep Awate, Maharashtra state epidemiologist, also said that coronavirus managed to wipe out other viruses during the peak of the pandemic.But Muliyil and Dr Gagandeep Kang, professor at the Christian Medical College, Vellore, said there is no scientific evidence to suggest that a dominant virus drives away other viruses.According to Muliyil, what may have happened is that when two viral infections occur simultaneously in a body, one virus may modify the clinical outcome, duration of infection and severity caused by the other virus. “That may have been the fate of H1N1 infection these past two years,” he said.Kang said that in the same family of a virus, a dominant variant may replace a weaker one, as seen with the Omicron variant of Covid-19. But there is no evidence to suggest that the coronavirus replaced H1N1 in 2020 and 2021. “Influenza is not as transmissible as Covid-19. Mask adherence may have deterred its transmission further,” she said.‘Apex of the pyramid’An analysis of the 72 deaths in Maharashtra showed that 85% of the deceased were 40 years of age or older while 65% had another illness or suffered from a comorbidity.“In 30 to 35% deaths, oseltamivir medicine was started for the patient within two days of symptoms,” Awate said. Oseltamivir is an antiviral used to treat H1N1. Awate added that the high fatality cannot be attributed to only the delay in treatment.In Maharashtra, the current case fatality rate, or number of people dying out of those diagnosed, stands at 3.8%. Awate said that not all symptomatic cases are being tested, hence the base pool to calculate fatality rate is small.There are four categories of patients – those under “A” and “B” have mild symptoms such as a cold and low-grade fever that can be managed at home. Doctors and hospitals may or may not recommend a test for them.In category “C”, patients develop pneumonia or have lung involvement leading to breathlessness while in category “D”, the symptoms are severe. “Category C and D require hospitalisation and they are being actively tested,” Awate said.There are also few government laboratories in India that are testing H1N1 as of now. Some laboratories have raised concerns about the lack of sufficient testing kits. At private facilities, the cost per test is between Rs 4,000-Rs 5,000. In Maharashtra, senior health officials have urged the state government to cap the rates of H1N1 testing. The state government is yet to announce a price cap.Kang, from the Christian Medical College, said 72 deaths in just three months in one state is a high figure. “This is just the apex of the pyramid,” she said. “Essentially, it is telling you there is a lot of virus circulating.” Globally, the death rate of H1N1 is less than 1%. A higher fatality rate in India indicates a lack of adequate diagnosis. Kang said that compared to the issue of not diagnosing all H1N1 cases, a bigger concern is the complete lack of diagnosis of other influenza-like illnesses. “It is like looking under a lamppost where there is light,” said Kang. “There are other influenza [viruses] which are in the dark and not even getting detected.” This reporting was supported by a grant from the Thakur Family Foundation.
