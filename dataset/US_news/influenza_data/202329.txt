However, their maintenance in lung is short-lived. TCR-dependent NFkB signaling is crucial for T cell memory but how and when NFkB signaling modulates tissue resident and circulating T cell memory during the immune response is unknown. Here, we find that enhancing NFkB signaling in T cells once memory to influenza is established, increases pro-survival Bcl-2 and CD122 levels thus boosting lung CD8+ TRM maintenance. By contrast, enhancing NFkB signals during the contraction phase of the response leads to a defect in CD8+ TRM differentiation without impairing recirculating memory subsets. Specifically, inducible activation of NFkB via constitutive active IKK2 or TNF interferes with TGFβ signaling, resulting in defects of lung CD8+ TRM imprinting molecules CD69, CD103, Runx3 and Eomes. Conversely, inhibiting NFkB signals not only recovers but improves the transcriptional signature and generation of lung CD8+ TRM. Thus, NFkB signaling is a critical regulator of tissue resident memory, whose levels can be tuned at specific times during infection to boost lung CD8+ TRM.

These memory T cells (TMEM) strategically relocate to blood and secondary lymphoid organs (central, TCM and effector, TEM memory) as well as portal of entry tissues (tissue resident, TRM) each, with specific phenotypes and functions4. Together, they guarantee the generation of a diverse and polyfunctional memory pool. In contrast to other memory subsets, TRM cells do not leave the tissue, and continue patrolling it for signs of pathogen re-entry. If this happens, they trigger innate immune responses and immediately control reinfection in situ, in tissues like lung, skin or gut5. TRM cells have a protective role not only in infectious diseases6,7,8,9, but also in cancer10,11,12,13. Yet, mounting evidence also associates TRM with pathology in autoimmunity, transplants, and graft versus host disease14,15,16. Although this puts TRM as a therapeutic target to treat disease, there is still a lack of understanding of how TRM cells are generated and maintained in tissues. Furthermore, the times during the immune response that are suitable for manipulation of TRM for therapeutic purposes are ill defined. This is particularly important in the case of respiratory infections such as influenza that depend on lung CD8+ TRM to control viral titers and disease severity17,18 but where CD8+ TRM longevity is limited18.One of the cardinal features of TRM cells is their imprinting of non-lymphoid “tissue residency”, which differentiates them from circulating memory T cells (TCIRCM). This is phenotypically characterized by high expression of CD69 and often (but not always) CD103. Transcriptionally, CD8+ TRM cells require high expression of Runx311, Nur7719,20 and low expression of Eomes21, although depending on the tissue, a balanced expression of other transcription factors, such as Blimp1 in lung22, is also important. Signals that occur prior to tissue entry23 and tissue-specific signals24 both contribute to the differentiation of TRM. Among these, antigen and TGFβ signals act at different points of the immune response to shape TRM25,26,27,28,29,30,31. Yet, the role of inflammation in the generation and maintenance of TRM remains largely unexplored.NFkB signaling is a major driver of inflammation32,33 as well as one of the signaling pathways induced by T cell receptor signaling upon antigen recognition34. Multiple pro-inflammatory factors (such as TNF, IL-1, or TLRs), together with antigen, signal through the canonical NFkB pathway at different times during infection35,36,37, making it a plausible signaling hub where different environmental cues converge to regulate T cell differentiation and cell fate decisions. Here we sought to understand how changes in the levels of IKK2/NFkB signaling that a CD8+ T cell experiences during infection, impact their memory fate. Our data show that NFkB signaling has a specific role in tissue-resident memory that is different from the other recirculating memory subsets. Furthermore, NFkB signaling differentially regulates CD8+ TRM differentiation and CD8+ TRM maintenance. Interestingly, our data also reveal that tuning NFkB signaling levels at specific times during influenza infection can aid to boost or deplete CD8+ TRM in the lung, an organ where these cells gradually vanished over time after vaccination or infection, leading to loss in protection38.ResultsIncreasing the levels of NFkB signaling after the peak of the immune response to influenza infection improves circulating CD8+ T cell memoryTo address the impact of NFkB signaling on T cell protective immunity, we generated two tetON inducible systems restricted to the T cell lineage. For this, we crossed mice carrying either a constitutively active Ikbkb allele (CA-IKK2)39 or a dominant negative-acting version of IKK2 (DN-IKK2)40 driven by the tetracycline TA-activated promoter (tetO)7 transactivator with mice expressing CD2-driven rtTA41. We refer to these mice as CD2rtTAxCA-IKK2 and CD2rtTAxDN-IKK2, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 1 and 2). Expression of CA- and DN-IKK2 can be monitored by a luciferase reporter (either by flow cytometry or by luciferase assays) and is restricted to the T cell lineage (Supplementary Fig. 2b, c). Furthermore, doxycycline (DOX) dependent induction of IKK2 (CA-IKK2ON) results in the upregulation of NFkB-dependent genes42,43 Supplementary Fig. 2d). Importantly, in these inducible models, constitutive activation of IKK2 in vivo does not lead to overt T cell apoptosis (no induction of cleaved caspase-3 or FasL) (Supplementary Fig. 2d).Next, we used these two inducible models to interrogate whether changing the levels of IKK2/NFkB signaling in T cells during specific phases of the immune response impacts CD8+ T cell memory. We tested whether boosting (or inhibiting) IKK2/NFkB signal transduction could modulate the establishment of circulating CD8+ memory in two different polyclonal models of infection. For this, we used both tetON IKK2 inducible models and manipulated NFkB signaling following on previous reports that suggested a role for p65NFkB transcriptional activity during the contraction phase of the immune response to Listeria monocytogenes42,44. We found that inhibition of NFkB signaling (DN-IKK2ON), during the contraction phase of the response, led to a loss of circulating CD8+ T cell memory. By contrast, increasing NFkB signaling (CA-IKK2ON) resulted in a considerable increase in the number of polyclonal antigen-specific memory CD8+ T cells generated, both against influenza A virus (IAV) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection (Supplementary Fig. 2e–h). Thus, NFkB has a critical role in the establishment of CD8+ T cell memory upon infection and most importantly, changing the levels of NFkB signaling can be used to boost or reduce CD8+ T cell memory.IKK2/NFkB signaling differentially regulates T cell memory subset diversitySince CD8+ T cell memory is composed of different subsets with unique locations and phenotypes, we next asked whether the impact of IKK2/NFkB signaling would equally affect all T cell memory subsets. Using our inducible models, we infected mice with IAV X31 and allowed CD8+ T cells to differentiate for 5 days. After this time, we either increased or decreased NFkB signaling in T cells by feeding mice with doxycycline chow for 25 additional days and then, measured the frequency and number of IAV-specific CD44hiCD62Lhi (central memory or TCM), CD44hi CD62Llo (effector memory or TEM) and TRM generated (Fig. 1a). CD44hi CD62Lhi and CD44hi CD62lo TMEM were measured in draining lymph nodes while TRM was assessed by intravascular (IV) staining, a method widely accepted in the field to identify T cells in the lung parenchyma5. Inhibition of NFkB signaling during the contraction phase of the IAV immune response, impaired the generation of both CD44hi CD62Lhi and CD44hi CD62Llo influenza-specific CD8+ TMEM cells. However, increasing NFkB signaling, improved the numbers of IAV-specific TCM generated but not CD44hiCD62Llo TMEM cells (Fig. 1b, c). CD44hi CD62Llo TMEM cells are often identified as effector memory (TEM) cells45. However, TEM cells are more prominent in peripheral tissues than in lymph nodes. Therefore, it is possible that the CD44hi CD62lo CD8+ TMEM population we examined included a substantial number of lymphoid CD69+ CD103+ TRM phenotype cells46,47. Interestingly, when we examined the generation of lung TRM, we observed that NFkB signaling had opposite effects on this T cell subset than on the other TMEM subsets present in the mediastinal lymph nodes. Generation of polyclonal IAV NP366 and PA224 antigen-specific CD8+ TMEM resident in the lung parenchyma (IV negative) was decreased under high levels of NFkB signals, both in frequencies and numbers. On the contrary, decreasing NFkB signaling resulted in a dramatic boost in the number of lung polyclonal IAV (NP and PA) specific CD8+ TRM generated (Fig. 1d, e). These differences were maintained when comparing the frequency and number of influenza-specific cells in the lung parenchyma that co-expressed the canonical TRM markers CD69 and CD103 (Fig. 1f). Importantly, our observations were not exclusive to the lung or the type of infection as the same results were observed for antigen-specific CD8+ TRM generated in the kidney upon VSV infection (Fig. 1g and Supplementary Fig. 3).Fig. 1: NFkB signaling differentially regulates T cell memory subset diversity.a Control, CD2rtTA x CA-IKK2 or CD2rtTA x DN-IKK2 mice were infected with influenza X31(1000 pfu).

We also did not observe differences in the frequency of lung IAV-specific CD4+ memory T cells when NFkB signals were increased, suggesting that the defect in CD8+ TRM was not due to decreased or increased generation of influenza-specific CD4+ T cells (Supplementary Fig. 4d).Fig. 2: Impairment in the generation of CD8+ TRM under enhanced NFkB signals is T cell intrinsic.a–c Control or CD2rtTA x CA-IKK2 mice were infected intranasally (i.n.) with influenza X31 (15000 pfu).

Bars represent mean values ± SD. P-values were determined by a two tailed unpaired t test, n.s. not significant. Source data provided as a source data file.Full size imageWe also investigated whether impaired generation of lung CD8+ TRM caused by enhanced NFkB signaling could be due to overt inflammation in the lung. A blinded independent pathologist evaluated inflammation in lung sections of mice where constitutive NFkB signaling was induced from day 5 to day 30 upon DOX administration and compared it to controls (no DOX). No signs of parenchymal disruption were apparent neither in control nor in mice subjected to DOX (Supplementary Fig. 4a). Increased NFkB signaling did not lead to non-specific activation of NK cells or dendritic cells (DC) either (Supplementary Fig. 4b, c).Finally, we used an adoptive transfer model to assess whether the effect of NFkB signaling was CD8+T cell intrinsic. In response to both, influenza and VSV intranasal (i.n.) infection, we found that increasing NFkB signaling late in the response (contraction phase), and only in CD8+ T cells, led to a severe loss in antigen-specific polyclonal and monoclonal lung CD8+ TRM (Fig. 2d, e). In contrast to this, inhibiting NFkB signaling intrinsically in CD8+ T cells, led to an increase in the generation of influenza-specific lung CD8+ TRM (Fig. 2f). Altogether data from Figs. 1, 2 reveal that IKK2/NFkB signaling is a critical pathway in the regulation of CD8+ T cell memory subset diversity. Furthermore, inhibition of NFkB signals can boost lung CD8+ TRM, whereas CD8+ T cells that are intrinsically exposed to high levels of NFkB signaling are impaired in the generation of protective memory T cells resident in the lung.Increasing IKK2 signaling impairs protection against heterologous infectionsCD8+ TRM is critical to provide protection in tissues against re-infection18,48. We, thus, tested whether increasing the amount of NFkB signaling in CD8+ T cells as they differentiate to TRM would impact protective immunity in the lung. For this, we followed a published approach to deplete circulating CD8+ T cells while sparing CD8+ TRM49. We adoptively transferred OT-I naïve male T cells into female or male congenically marked hosts, followed by intranasal VSV-OVA infection (Fig. 3a). Consistent with rejection against male antigen, male circulating donors vanished in female but not in male hosts (Fig. 3b, c and Supplementary Fig. 5a). These conditions allowed us to singularly evaluate the T cell protective ability of antigen specific lung CD8+ TRM generated under high levels of NFkB signaling in the context of heterologous intranasal PR8-OVA infection (Fig. 3a). Consistent with our results in Fig. 2, high levels of NFkB signaling (CA-IKK2ON model) led to a loss of CD8+ TRM (Fig. 3d, Supplementary Fig. 5b). Most importantly, female hosts bearing only male CA-IKK2ON CD8+ TRM cells exhibited ~200 times higher virus titers than their control counterparts in the lung upon influenza infection (Fig. 3e). This was despite better effector T cell memory function (Fig. 3f). These data thus show that loss of CD8+ TRM due to high levels of NFkB signaling impairs protective immunity in the lung.Fig. 3: Enhancing NFkB signaling reduces TRM and compromises protection against heterologous infection.a Naive CD8+ donor T cells from male OT-IxIKK2CAfl/flxGzBCre or OT-I littermate control mice were adoptively transferred into groups of congenically marked male and female host mice, followed by intranasal infection with 2×104 pfu VSV-OVA. b Rejection was determined at 10 p.i. in mediastinal lymph nodes.

In our model, NFkB signals were over-induced after several days of infection coinciding with a time where some antigen-specific effector T cells are being recruited to tissue while others are continuing their differentiation in tissue. We thus sought to determine when CD8+ TRM loss began for CA-IKK2ON CD8+ T cells. For this, we repeated similar experiments to the ones in Fig. 1 and monitored the frequency and number of influenza-specific CA-IKK2ON and control CD8+ CD69+ T cells in lung at day 10 p.i and 30 p.i. (Fig. 4a–c, h). We found that the loss of CA-IKK2ON CD8+ TRM happened between day 10 and day 30 p.i. (Fig. 4b, c and Supplementary Fig. 6). The loss of CD8+ TRM correlated with a reduction in the number of CD8+ TRM expressing the TRM tissue markers CD69 and CD103 (Fig. 4c, d and Supplementary Fig. 6). However, we did not observe any defect in the frequency or number of circulating CD8+ memory T cells in the lung (Fig. 4f) or in the expression of CXCR3, one of the chemokine receptors important for lung recruitment (Fig. 4e)53. Interestingly, when we assessed the frequency and number of CD69 negatives within the IV negative CD8+ population, we observed that CA-IKK2ON CD8+ T cells lost CD69 expression but appeared in the parenchyma in numbers close to controls (as opposed to disappearing due to cell death or quickly abandoning the parenchyma), suggesting an increase in the frequency of trafficking “effector” memory CD8+ population (Fig. 4c, day 30, graphs on the right). Therefore, enhanced NFkB signals do not interfere with the recruitment of CA-IKK2ON cells to the lung but rather with the ability of these cells to stay in parenchyma as “bona fide” TRM (CD69+).Fig. 4: NFkB signaling regulates CD8+ TRM transcriptional programming.a, b Control or CA-IKK2ON mice were infected with X31(1000 pfu) and ±DOX day 5–30 p.i.

Source data provided as a source data file.Full size imageTo further investigate this possibility, we tested whether the defect in the establishment of the CA-IKK2ON CD8+ TRM pool was a consequence of TRM transcriptional programming and/or survival. CD8+ TRM differentiation requires downregulation of T-box transcription factors Eomes and T-bet21,54, induction of Runx3 and Nur7711,55 and Blimp1 in the lung22. Additionally, some studies attribute a role for IL-15 in the homeostasis/survival of CD8+ TRM in tissue26,56,57. We observed that CA-IKK2ON CD8+ TRM expressed higher levels of T-bet and Eomes than their control counterparts. However, they exhibited reduced levels of Nur77 and Runx3 and expressed normal levels of Blimp1 (Fig. 4g and Supplementary Fig. 6e, f). Conversely, DN-IKK2ON CD8+ TRM exhibited a reversion of the levels of Nur77 and Eomes and an increase in the induction of Runx3 over control levels (Fig. 4g). The expression of CD122, one of the chains of the IL-15R, was also impaired in CA-IKK2ON CD8+ TRM cells but not in DN-IKK2ON CD8+ TRM cells. (Fig. 4g). Importantly, CD69 negative CA-IKK2ON CD8+T cells in the parenchyma also exhibited defects in the expression of TRM transcription factors Eomes and Runx3 when compared with their CD69 positive counterparts and controls (Fig. 4h). Collectively, these data support the idea that the level of NFkB signaling that a CD8+ T cell experiences can shape its TRM transcriptional programming and its survival within the lung parenchyma.NFkB signaling inhibits TGFβ signals for CD8+ TRM The fact that the number of CA-IKK2ON CD8+ TRM cells started to decrease late in the immune response and that this coincided with changes in TRM-associated transcription factors (Eomes and Runx3) that are regulated by tissue cues24,50, led us to hypothesize that NFkB signaling could be inhibiting tissue signals that are required for lung CD8+ TRM differentiation. TGFβ is a crucial cytokine for tissue-resident memory differentiation and plays a specific role in lung. Moreover, both Runx3 and CD103 are downstream targets of TGFβ signaling58,59, and our data showed defects in both TRM markers in CA-IKK2ON CD8+ TRM cells (Figs. 1f, 4g, h). Therefore, we tested whether NFkB signaling could inhibit TGFβ signaling in differentiating CD8+ T cells. For this, we used our two inducible models where IKK2 signaling can be increased in CD8+ T cells (Fig. 2d, e). CD8+ T cells that were exposed to TGFβ while NFkB signaling was over-induced indeed expressed lower levels of CD103 and Runx3 than TGFβ controls (Fig. 5a). Furthermore, increasing NFkB signaling also resulted in defective canonical (phosphorylated Smad2/3 or p-Smad2/3) and non-canonical (phosphorylated ERK or p-ERK) TGFβ signal transduction (Fig. 5b, d, Supplementary Fig. 7). Of note, in the context of infection, CA-IKK2ON CD8+ T cells experiencing high levels of NFkB signaling also exhibited lower levels of TGFβ signaling than their control counterparts (Fig. 5c).Fig. 5: TNF and NFkB signaling inhibit TGFβ signaling and downstream TRM markers, CD103 and Runx3.a Splenocytes from OT-I (control) or OT-IxIKK2fl/flxGzBCre mice (CA-IKK2ON) were stimulated for 48 h. with OVA and TGFβ.

Source data provided as a source data file.Full size imageIn other cell types, NFkB can interfere with TGFβ signals through the expression of the inhibitory protein Smad760. Thus, we next determined the levels of Smad7 under the conditions in Fig. 5a. Consistent with the idea that NFkB signals could induce Smad7 expression in T cells and thereby inhibit TGFβ signaling, we observed that CD8+ T cells under high NFkB signaling upregulated Smad7 expression as p-Smad2/3 and p-ERK levels decreased (Fig. 5d, Supplementary Fig. 7). Collectively, these data show that IKK2/NFkB signaling negatively regulates TGFβ signaling and the CD8+ TRM markers, Runx3 and CD103.TNF-mediated NFkB signaling inhibits TGFβ signaling for TRM NFkB signaling is a mediator of inflammatory signals elicited during respiratory infections61,62,63. One of the most understood NFkB triggers is the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF, which has been associated with TRM in the lung64 and signals through the canonical NFkB pathway35. Therefore, we hypothesized that TNF could, via NFkB, inhibit TGFβ signaling and impair CD8+ TRM. To directly test this, we designed an experiment where CD8+ T cells differentiating in the presence of TNF were exposed to TGFβ and then measured changes in TGFβ signaling as well as two TRM markers downstream of TGFβ (Runx3 and CD103). As expected, TNF did not induce TGFβ signaling or the expression of Runx3 and CD103 while TGFβ did. However, consistent with the idea that TNF inhibits TGFβ signaling, CD8+ T cells differentiating in the presence of TGFβ were impaired in the phosphorylation of Smad2/3 and the expression of Runx3 or CD103 when TNF was also present (Fig. 5e–h).To confirm whether the ability of TNF to inhibit TGFβ signaling was NFkB dependent, we repeated the same experiments with DN-IKK2ON CD8+ T cells and used DOX to inhibit NFkB signaling. Confirming our hypothesis, DN-IKK2ON CD8+ T cells remained unresponsive to the effects of TNF on TGFβ signaling (Fig. 5g, i). Thus, TNF inhibits TGFβ signaling and the expression of proteins crucial for CD8+ TRM via NFkB. We also assessed whether TNF and NFkB signaling would affect the induction of other transcription factors important for lung CD8+ TRM. Blimp1 was not affected by TNF and/or TGFβ (Fig. 5i). However, T-bet and Eomes were (Fig. 5i). Remarkably, Eomes expression was inhibited by TGFβ65 and neither TNF nor inhibiting NFkB signaling could revert it (Fig. 5i).TNF has been shown to be involved in the acquisition of the CD8+ TRM phenotype in in vitro studies25,66 before, but how changes in TNF levels affect the generation of CD8+ TRM in vivo has not been investigated yet. We thus, decided to test the impact that taming TNF levels during influenza infection would have in the generation of antigen-specific lung CD8+ TRM. For this, we used an OT-I adoptive transfer model where we could evaluate the generation of OVA antigen-specific OT-I TRM donors in the lung upon PR8-OVA infection. Based on the data shown in Fig. 5e–i, we predicted that a blockade of TNF would improve the generation of lung CD8+ TRM in high-inflammatory conditions. High inflammation (high TNF) provided by antigen non-specific IAV infection64,67, caused a decrease in lung OT-I CD8+ TRM (treated with IgG rat isotype) compared with controls. However, blockade of TNF led to a recovery of OT-I TRM numbers and a significant increase over Ig control (Fig. 5j–l). TNF blockade also resulted in an increase in circulating OT-I donors in the lung (Fig. 5l, Supplementary Fig. 8), suggesting that reducing TNF signals may increase CD8+ TRM either by enhancing antigen-specific T cell recruitment to the lung and/or survival of both circulatory and CD8+ TRM cells. Importantly, blockade of TNF signals recovered TGFβ signaling and resulted in an Eomes and Runx3 expression profile that was conducive to CD8+ TRM differentiation (Fig. 5m). Altogether, our data show that TNF-dependent NFkB signals inhibit CD8+ TRM differentiation via TGFβ signaling and that blockade of TNF can improve CD8+ TRM generation in conditions of high or continuous inflammation.At memory, NFkB signaling promotes lung CD8+ TRM survivalUpon influenza infection, lung CD8+ TRM cells fail to persist, weakening protective immunity against the same or other influenza variants18,67. In prior work using NFkB pharmaceutical inhibitors, we had found that once memory CD8+ T cells are generated their maintenance depended on NFkB signals42. Although these studies did not distinguish between the different T cell memory subsets, the data conflicted with our findings that enhanced NFkB signaling is detrimental to CD8+ TRM differentiation (Figs. 1, 2, 4). Therefore, we decided to address the impact of NFkB signaling on CD8+ TRM at memory once memory T cells had been formed. For this, we used the CA-IKK2ON inducible model and allowed the generation of CD8+ TRM in the lung upon IAV infection. 30 d.p.i, we inhibited NFkB signaling (DOX treatment) and compared control and DOX-treated mice for changes in the number of CD8+ TRM in the lung parenchyma. We observed a ~4-fold increase in the number of IAV-specific CD8+ TRM cells in the lung when NFkB signaling had been induced (Fig. 6a). Strikingly, this was the opposite effect that increasing NFkB signals during contraction had in CD8+ TRM generation (Fig. 1). The increase in CA-IKK2ON CD8+ TRM at memory correlated with higher levels of CD122 and Bcl-2, suggesting NFkB signals at memory mediate CD8+ TRM survival (Fig. 6b).Fig. 6: Increasing NFkB signaling at memory improves CD8+ TRM survival.Groups of control or CD2rtTA x CA-IKK2 mice (a–e) or CD2rtTAxDN-IKK2 mice (f–j) were infected with influenza X31 (1000 pfu). At 30 d.p.i. mice were fed a ±DOX (CA-IKK2ON) diet for 15 days. (a, f). Mice were infected with Influenza X31 and TRM were identified by IV neg. labeling.

Bars represent mean values ± SD. P-values were determined by two-tailed unpaired t test, n.s. not significant. Source data provided as a source data file.Full size imageIn most tissues, TRM maintenance is independent of the input of circulating memory T cells (TCIRCM)68,69. However, in the lung this is still controversial67,70. In our studies, increasing NFkB signals at memory significantly boosted the frequency and number of IAV-specific CD8+ TCIRCM and TRM in the lung (Fig. 6c and Supplementary Fig. 9). We performed additional experiments to test whether the increase in CD8+ TRM upon transient induction of NFkB signals was due to an increase in cellular turnover or homeostatic proliferation. For this, we performed BrdU labeling in vivo upon DOX administration67. We observed no changes in BrdU incorporation or lung CA-IKK2ON TRM or TCIRC cell proliferation (Supplementary Fig. 10). However, both lung CA-IKK2ON CD8+ TRM and TCIRC exhibited much higher levels of Bcl-2 than their control counterparts further suggesting that NFkB drives persistence of lung CD8+ TRM by boosting T cell memory survival (Supplementary Fig. 10).Remarkably, inducing NFkB signaling at memory was also beneficial for the CD8+ TCM pool (CD62Lhi expressing cells) as we also observed a significant increase in the number of IAV-specific CD8+ TCM in draining lymph nodes after DOX treatment (Fig. 6d, e).We also tested whether transient induction of IKK2/NFkB signaling at memory would provide a temporary or a long-term increase in IAV-specific CD8+ TRM. To test this in a CD8+ T cell-intrinsic manner, we transferred OT-I naïve donors from OT-I.CD90.1xCD2rtTAxCA-IKK2 mice into CD90.2 B6 hosts and infected the mice with PR8-OVA. At memory, we treated chimeric mice with or without DOX for 10 days as in Fig. 6a and then removed treatment in a cohort of the DOX-treated mice and not in the other. Fifteen days after interrupting the induction of NFkB signaling (DOX treatment), we assessed IAV-specific CD8+ TRM decay. While continuous provision of NFkB signals led to a steady increase of lung CD8+ TRM, removal of IKK2 constitutive signaling reverted the numbers of CD8+ TRM to control levels (Supplementary Fig. 11). From these, we concluded that an increase in NFkB signaling at memory can boost lung CD8+ TRM, as long as the provision of NFkB signaling is continuously maintained. Interruption of NFkB signaling also affected lung circulating memory, most likely because NFkB signaling supports the survival of all CD8+ memory subsets.Finally, we performed similar experiments using the DN-IKK2ON inducible model. Inhibiting NFkB signaling once CD8+ TRM cells have formed, had the converse effect, resulting in a loss in CD8+ TRM numbers and a decrease in the expression of survival factors (CD122 and Bcl-2) (Fig. 6f, g). This was similar for the circulatory T cells in the lung and for TCM cells in draining lymph nodes, further demonstrating that NFkB signals are key for the survival and maintenance of CD8+ TCIRCM and TRM upon influenza infection (Fig. 6h–j and Supplementary Fig. 9).In summary, our data reveal that NFkB signaling differentially affects tissue-resident memory depending on the stage of differentiation of the CD8+ T cell (before and after becoming CD8+ TRM). Most importantly, our results support the idea that enhancing NFkB signaling in CD8+ T cells once the TRM pool has been established could improve CD8+ TRM survival in tissue and circulatory memory populations.DiscussionT-cell memory in tissues is an essential part of mucosal immunity that protects against infection and can contribute to disease. Here we show that the pro-inflammatory signaling pathway IKK2/NFkB, is critical for both the generation and maintenance of the CD8+ TRM pool after infection. Our results mainly refer to influenza-specific CD8+ TRM in the lung, a tissue where maintaining a long-lived CD8+ TRM pool is crucial for protective immunity18 but challenging, due to the CD8+ TRM short life-span71. The reasons why resident memory CD8+ T cells are short-lived in the lung but not in other tissues are still unclear. However, our work suggests that boosting NFkB signaling at the end of the immune response might offer a therapeutic opportunity to increase CD8+ TRM survival and protective immunity upon infection or vaccination. Furthermore, since improved survival also occurred for CD8+ TCM of the draining lymph nodes, this suggests a controlled increase in NFkB signaling could boost several subsets of the T cell memory pool.It is striking that the same signaling pathway, NFkB, operates in opposite manners for CD8+ T cells depending on their differentiation stage (during TRM differentiation and after). This could be due to epigenetic modifications that regulate the accessibility of NFkB to specific gene loci depending on the differentiation stage of a CD8+ T cell. Alternatively, changes in the environmental cues as the infection resolves could also explain the differential impact on CD8+ TRM when levels of NFkB signaling increase. Although our findings cannot distinguish between these two possibilities, our data suggest that NFkB signaling does interfere with TGFβ to skew CD8+ T effectors away from TRM. In this regard, it is important to note that TGFβ levels in tissue can change depending on age and in the context of diseases such as infection, autoimmunity, asthma, or fibrosis72, although how these conditions affect CD8+ TRM generation or survival is still poorly understood.Multiple signals can locally trigger the induction of NFkB signaling in CD8+ T cells, including antigen, TLRs and pro-inflammatory cytokines35,36,37. We show that TNF, a known driver of NFkB35 is able to inhibit TGFβ dependent signaling and TRM programming in CD8+ T cells. Furthermore, our data suggest that blocking TNF late in the response can increase the generation of CD8+ TRM. This role of TNF is different from the one described by previous studies from Harty’s group at memory, when blocking TNF resulted in a reduction in CD8+ TRM67,70. Their results, however, are consistent with our data at memory supporting the idea that NFkB signaling effects on CD8+ TRM differentiation, before and after CD8+ T cell memory is established, are different. TNF and other pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 are heavily produced in pathological settings of chronic inflammation and could easily affect the levels of NFkB signals73,74,75 that a CD8+ T cell experiences in tissue. For the CD8+ T cells that also encounter TGFβ locally, this could decrease their likelihood to become CD8+ TRM. Further evaluation of the dynamics of CD8+ TRM during infections with a strong pro-inflammatory profile could provide insight into how overt inflammation may affect long-term immunity and inform of specific therapeutics targeting NFkB or its pro-inflammatory drivers to either boost or deplete tissue-resident memory. This might be especially relevant in the context of immune treatments that are linked to high levels of inflammation and that in the case of cancer76,77 or autoimmunity (such as rheumatoid arthritis) have a TRM component that affects disease outcome14,78. In the same line, it would also be important to evaluate how current treatments targeting TNF or NFkB signaling in the clinic, affect the establishment of tissue-resident memory in patients.NFkB signaling did not affect CD8+ TRM in the same manner as it did for other TCIRCM subsets in the mediastinal lymph nodes, indicating that NFkB signaling is a key regulator of T cell memory diversity. Modulation of NFkB signaling levels may serve as an opportunity to regulate specific T cell memory subsets depending on their role in disease.Finally, our findings also underscore the impact that fluctuating levels of a single signaling pathway can have on the quality of T cell memory depending on how and when during the infection these levels change. This may be particularly important for pleiotropic signaling pathways such as NFkB where multiple stimuli feed in (including patient’s treatments) and can easily add up to shape T cell fate. Incorporating this concept into current vaccine strategies could aid to improve their long-term efficacy.MethodsAll procedures were conducted according to the NIH guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals and biological safety and were approved by the University of Missouri Institutional Animal Care and use and Institutional Biosafety Committees.MiceOT-I.CD90.1 (or Thy1.1+) TCR transgenic strain were generated in the lab by crossing OT-I mice (C57BL/6-Tg (TcraTcrb)1100Mjb/J 003831 from Jackson Laboratory) and B6.CD90.1 mice (B6.PL-Thy1a/CyJ Strain no. 000406 from Jackson Laboratory); C57BL/6J (B6. CD90.2), B6.SJL-Ptprca Pepcb/BoyJ (CD45.1 congenic C57BL/6), B6.Cg-Gt(ROSA)26Sortm4(Ikbkb)Rsky/J (IKK2-CAfl/fl), B6 -Tg (GzB-cre)1Jcb/J (GzB-Cre) mice were from Jackson Laboratory(Bar Harbor, ME). OT-I.CD90.1XIKK2CAfl/fl xGzBCre; CD2rtTA x CA-IKK2 (tetracycline-inducible constitutive active IKK2) and CD2rtTA x DN-IKK2 (tetracycline-inducible dominant negative IKK2) mice were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions at the University of Missouri. All mouse strains are on the C57BL/6 background and were screened for transgene homozygosity by PCR. Mice were aged between 8 and 13 weeks at the time of infection for all experiments. Female and male mice were not disaggregated as no gender bias was found. Experiments in Fig. 3 required designated genders otherwise, experiments were gender matched. Infection and maintenance of mice infected with influenza virus or vesicular stomatitis virus occurred in an ABSL2 facility at the University of Missouri. Mice were euthanized by CO2 inhalation followed by cervical dislocation. Mouse housing conditions: Light/dark cycle: 12/12 with lights on at 7 AM and off at 7 PM. Ambient temperature: 70–71 °C. Humidity: 50–55%. All animal procedures were conducted according to the NIH guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals and were approved by the University of Missouri Institutional Animal Care and use Committee.Reagents, antibodies, and primersProvided in Supplementary Tables 1–3 in supplementary information.Virus infectionsMice were infected intranasally with 1000 pfu influenza A/HKx-31 (X31, H3N2) for sublethal infection or intravenously with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) (2 × 106 pfu), unless otherwise indicated in Figure legends. For heterologous infection experiments, mice were primed intranasally with 5 × 104 pfu VSV-OVA, then challenged 30 days later with 5000 pfu of influenza A/PR8-OVA (PR8, H1N1).Viral titersThe TCID50 of influenza virus was determined using MDCK cells as described (74). Briefly, lung samples were homogenized using a Mini-BeadBeater (BioSpec, Bartlesville, OK) and cleared homogenate was used to inoculate confluent MDCK cell monolayers. 24 h post-inoculation, the supernatant was discarded and replaced with fresh media (DMEM containing 0.0002% Trypsin). Agglutination of chicken RBCs (Rockland Immunochemicals Inc., Limerick, PA) was utilized to determine the presence of influenza virus after 3 days of culture.In vivo antibody labeling and flow cytometryFor in vivo antibody labeling and differentiation of T cells circulating in the vasculature or resident in parenchyma (TRM) tissues, three minutes before being killed, mice were injected intravenously via tail vein injection with 2 μg PE-labeled CD45.2 (clone 104, Biolegend) or PE-labeled CD8β, (clone Ly-3, BD Biosciences). Lungs, kidney, spleen, and mediastinal lymph node tissues were harvested, and lymphocytes isolated. Next, lymphocytes were stained in vitro with anti-CD8α antibodies along with fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies specific of other surface markers resuspended in FACS buffer (PBS/1% fetal bovine serum). For immunostaining of intracellular markers such as transcription factors T-bet, Eomes or Nur77, after staining of cell surface markers, cell samples were rinsed, fixed and permeabilized with Cytofix/cytoperm. Stained cells were run on a LSR Fortessa flow cytometer (BD, San Jose, CA, data collected with FACS Diva 6.0 by BD) or run on a Cytek Aurora spectral flow cytometer using the Cytek Spectraflo 3.0.3 software. Flow cytometry data was analyzed using with FlowJo software version 10.4 (Tree Star, Inc., Ashland, OR). It should be considered that our observations refer mainly to the generation and maintenance of influenza-specific memory CD8+ T cells in the lung parenchyma identified through IV labeling, a method widely used to study TRM cells in the field. One limitation of this approach is that it can only provide a snapshot of the cells that are residents in tissue at a given time and it is less accurate at quantifying T cells in transition. A table of antibodies is provided in supplementary information.Intracellular cytokine stainingLymphocytes were isolated from the lungs of VSV-OVA-challenged mice and stimulated ex vivo with OVA peptide 1 μM) in the presence of Golgi-Plug (BD Biosciences) for 5 h. Following incubation, cells were harvested and antigen-specific CD8+ T cells were assessed for the expression of TNF and IFNγ by flow cytometry as in44.Intracellular phosphorylated-SMAD2/3 and phosphorylated-NFkB detection by immunostaining for flow cytometryCell suspensions from lung, lymph nodes or spleen were fixed with 4% Formaldehyde aqueous solution for 20 min at room temperature, followed by two rinses with PBS/1% fetal bovine serum solution (FACs buffer). Permeabilization was performed with ice-cold methanol at −20 °C overnight. The next day, cells were stained with anti-phospho SMAD2/3 or anti-phospho NFkB in PBS/1% fetal bovine serum solution. For Phospho NFkB staining, inhibitors of phosphatases (sodium pervanadate 1 mM, and sodium fluoride 100 mM) were added at the same time.GenotypingGenomic DNA from mouse tail clippings was isolated using the AccuStart II kit. The genomic DNA was amplified using rtTA forward and rtTA reverse primers to identify the Cd2rtTA transgene and IKK2 forward and IKK2 reverse primers were used to identify the Ikbkb mutant transgene (constitutive active form). PCR reactions were performed in an Eppendorf Mastercycler according to refs. 40,41,79. PCR products were resolved with a 1% agarose gel. Primer sequences are provided in supplementary information (Supplementary Table 2).CD8+ T cell enrichment and adoptive transferSplenocytes were harvested from CD2rtTA x CA-IKK2 mice and polyclonal CD8+ T cells were purified by magnetic selection (CD8+ T cell isolation kit by Miltenyi Biotech Auburn, CA). 5 × 105 CD8+ polyclonal or 104 OT-I.CD90.1XIKK2CAfl/flxGzBCre monoclonal naïve T cells were adoptively transferred into congenic C57BL/6 mice 1 day prior to intranasal infection with influenza or VSV-OVA virus, respectively.BrdU LabelingBrdU was obtained from Biolegend. Mice were given a bolus dose of BrdU (2 mg I.P.) and given a supplemental dose (0.8 mg daily) of BrdU in their drinking water for 6 additional days. BrdU incorporation of lymphocytes was determined by flow cytometry. Lymphocytes were isolated and subjected to appropriate phenotyping antibodies. Cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde then permeabilized with 0.5% Triton followed by DNase treatment (Sigma) then stained with AlexaFluor 647 conjugated anti-BrdU antibody (clone 3D4, Biolegend).TNF Blockade during influenza infectionHost Mice received 1 × 105 congenic OT-I CD 90.1T cells followed by infection with PR8-OVA (100 pfu). Groups were treated with either Anti-TNF blocking antibody or Rat IgG control. Specifically, TNF signaling was blocked by treating mice with an Ultra-LEAF purified, TNF-specific antibody (clone MP6-XT22) while an Rat IgG1κ isotype control was used in parallel in control treatment mice .100 μg of antibody was administered via intranasal instillation on days 10, 14, 20, 22, and 24 post-infection. Then, treated mice were reinfected with influenza PR8 (100 pfu) at 10 d.p.i. and compared with non-treated and non-PR8 re-infected controls for numbers of OT-I TRM and TCIRC in the lung as well as for their levels of pSmad2.3 and RunX3.In vitro culture and cytokine stimulationSplenocytes isolated from OT-I.CD901.1XIKK2CAfl/fl xGzBCre mice were stimulated with 20 nM OVA peptide for 48 h at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml. TGFβ (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) was then added to a final concentration of 50 ng/ml. At 30 min and 24 h post TGFβ stimulation, cells were harvested for analysis by flow cytometry and western blotting. Splenocytes from CD2rtTA x DN-IKK2 mice were stimulated in vitro at 1 × 106 cells/ml with 10 μg/ml anti-CD3 (clone 145-2C11) and 10 μg/ml anti-CD28 (clone 37.51) (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Following 24 h of stimulation, cells were divided and incubated in the presence or absence of 125 ng/ml recombinant TNF (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) for 24 additional hours. The cells were again divided and incubated in the presence or absence of 50 ng/ml TGFβ (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Cells were harvested at 30 min and 24 h post addition of TGFβ and analyzed by flow cytometry.Western blottingIn vitro stimulated cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 10 mM HEPES, 10 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.2 mM EGTA, 0.5% NP40, 1 mM DTT, 2 mM Na3VO4, 20 mM NaF, 1 mg/ml Leupeptin, 1 mg/ml Aprotinin, 1 mM PMSF. Samples were resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were blocked with Blotting Grade Blocker (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and probed with specific primary and secondary antibodies. Blots were imaged on a Li-Cor Odyssey XF (Li-Cor, Lincoln, NE) and analyzed using Image Studio v5.2.5 (Li-Cor, Lincoln, NE). A table of antibodies is provided in supplementary information.

Facebook Twitter Print Email ‘Low risk’ for humans, as cats in Poland test positive for avian influenza 17 July 2023 Health Polish authorities are investigating all potential sources of infection after some 29 cats were found to be infected with the influenza A virus, similar to those found in birds, the UN World Health Organization (WHO) reported on Sunday. As of Wednesday, 12 July, no human contacts of A(H5N1) positive cats have reported any symptoms, the UN health agency said, adding that the surveillance period for all contacts has now complete.National first Tweet URL There have been previous “sporadic” cases of what is more commonly referred to as the bird flu virus, but the cases in Poland are the first time high numbers of infected cats have been reported over a wide geographical area within a single country, WHO said.“The risk of human infections following exposure to infected cats at the national level is assessed as low for the general population, and low to moderate for cat owners and those occupationally exposed to H5N1-infected cats, such as veterinarians, without the use of appropriate personal protective equipment”.WHO advised those exposed to animal flu viruses and all contacts of confirmed human cases, to monitor their health for the duration of the known exposure period, plus an additional minimum of seven days.‘No change’ in WHO adviceWHO said that the report of the infections among cats does not change its current recommendations on public health measures and surveillance.“Due to the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, WHO continues to stress the importance of global surveillance to detect and monitor virological, epidemiological and clinical changes associated with emerging or circulating influenza viruses that may affect human or animal health and timely virus-sharing for risk assessment,” the agency said.The UN agency called on public health and animal health authorities to collaborate closely, share information, and conduct joint risk assessment and response to outbreaks of zoonotic influenza at the human-animal interface, adhering to the One Health approach.Cat deathsAccording to WHO, as of 11 July, authorities in Poland tested 47 samples from 46 cats and one captive caracal wild cat. Of these, 29 were found to be positive for influenza A (H5N1).Fourteen cats were reportedly euthanized, and a further 11 died, with the last death reported on 30 June.The positive samples were reported from 13 geographical areas within the country.Source of exposure ‘unknown’The source of exposure to the virus is currently unknown and epizootic investigations are ongoing. “There are several possibilities for the source of infection, among which the cats could have had direct or indirect contact with infected birds or their environments, ate infected birds, or ate food contaminated with the virus,” WHO said adding that, authorities are investigating “all potential sources and to date have not ruled out any.” Of the 25 cats for which information is available, two were outdoor, 18 were indoor with access to a balcony, terrace, or backyard, and five without access to the outside environment. Seven of the 25 cats reportedly had the opportunity for contact with wild birds.Ongoing monitoringWHO said that together with the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH), it continues to monitor rapidly evolving virus, and updating recommendations for curbing its spread, in addition to working with countries in preparedness and response. The UN health agency is also evaluating the existing candidate vaccine viruses of A(H5N1) through its Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System to ensure valid candidate vaccine viruses are developed. ♦ Receive daily updates directly in your inbox - Subscribe here to a topic. ♦ Download the UN News app for your iOS or Android devices. polandAvian influenza Related Stories Avian flu reappears in Cambodia, UN health agency warns No sign yet of H5N1 bird flu spreading between humans, says WHO chief UN refugee agency ‘deeply shocked’ at stabbing death of ‘deeply courageous’ Polish mayor Resources Button collapse Navigate the News Information for Broadcasters UN System Links Media Alert UN Journal Meetings Coverage Audiovisual Library Secretary-General Button collapse All Statements Official Travels Press Encounters SG Twitter Spokesperson's Office Button collapse Latest Statements Briefing Highlights Briefing Transcripts Notes to Correspondents Find Us Button collapse UN News App Facebook Twitter YouTube RSS Footer menu A-Z Site Index Copyright FAQ Fraud Alert Privacy Notice Terms of Use Social Media Links Footer buttons Donate Facebook Twitter Print EmailBird flu, explained | VoxSkip to main contentThe homepageVoxVox logoExplainersPoliticsCultureAdviceListenAudioWatchVideoMenuThe homepageVoxVox logoNavigation DrawercloseCloseSearchVideoWatchAudioListenCrosswordPlayExplainersPoliticsCultureAdviceScienceTechnologyClimateHealthMoneyLifeFuture PerfectNewslettersBecome a MemberLogin / Sign UpFacebookInstagramYoutubeRSSTikTokVoxVox logoYes, bird flu is a threat.

It’s time to take it seriously.13 questions about bird flu, answered.by Benji JonesJul 17, 2023, 11:00 AM UTCFacebookLinkHealth workers in northern Israel put a crane that died of bird flu in a bag for disposal on January 2, 2022. Ariel Schalit/APBenji Jones is an environmental correspondent at Vox, covering biodiversity loss and climate change. Before joining Vox, he was a senior energy reporter at Business Insider. Benji previously worked as a wildlife researcher.In the last two years, more than half a billion birds have died globally. The cause isn’t deforestation or climate change or the destruction of grasslands — all of which are contributing to the precipitous decline of wild birds — but avian influenza, i.e., bird flu.The majority of these birds were farmed chickens and turkeys; as the virus, known as H5N1, began circulating among poultry flocks in the US, Europe, and elsewhere, farmers started culling a record number of birds to stop the pathogen from spreading.Yet what’s unusual about this virus is that it’s also been spreading rapidly among wild birds and even mammals, such as mink and sea lions, often causing severe infection or death. This raises a red flag among health officials.“The increasing number of H5N1 avian influenza detections among mammals — which are biologically closer to humans than birds are — raises concern that the virus might adapt to infect humans more easily,” three United Nations agencies, including the World Health Organization, warned in a recent statement. “These outbreaks pose ongoing risks to humans.”A biologist at the Santa Ursula University Marine Animal Rehabilitation Center in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, examines a brown booby for bird flu on June 26, 2023. Bruna Prado/APThe risk of humans contracting bird flu is still incredibly low, new research shows, and the virus does not have the biological machinery to cause a pandemic (unlike the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which is great at spreading among humans). But the more this pathogen spreads, especially among mammals, the more opportunities it has to evolve traits that make it dangerous. That’s why scientists are taking it so seriously.What is bird flu?Avian influenza, or bird flu, is a general term for the disease caused by influenza viruses that primarily infect and spread among poultry and some wild birds. They’re distinct from viruses that cause the flu in humans, though they’re related.These avian viruses are common. They’ve been circulating for eons among wild waterfowl, such as ducks and geese, without causing them much harm. Mild forms of infection are called low-pathogenic avian influenza, or LPAI, which means they’re typically not deadly.The type of avian influenza spreading today is different.Occasionally, an LPAI virus can jump from wild birds to poultry farms. As the virus replicates in densely packed warehouses of farmed birds, it can quickly evolve and pick up adaptations that make it highly deadly to poultry. At that point, it gets dubbed a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, or HPAI virus. That’s what’s circulating today — an HPAI virus.Still, these more deadly forms of avian influenza viruses are not new. They’ve caused outbreaks on poultry farms many times in the past that have killed thousands to millions of farm birds. What makes this particular form of avian influenza virus so unusual is that it easily spreads and causes severe disease among wild birds and — importantly — some mammals.Why is it in the news right now?The particular type of avian influenza spreading today descended from a virus that caused an outbreak on a goose farm in Guangdong, China, in 1996. That virus — one of a type of virus known as H5N1 — was highly pathogenic and killed more than 40 percent of the farm birds it infected.Since then, H5N1 viruses of Guangdong descent have caused sporadic outbreaks among poultry and some wild bird populations, largely in the Eastern Hemisphere. But around late 2021, the HPAI virus started going global, arriving in North America and then spreading south.Bird flu first became big news in the US when it started spreading among poultry farms, forcing farmers to cull millions of egg-laying hens. That threatened the livelihood of farmers and sent egg prices soaring in late 2022 and early this year.Then more and more reports of the virus spreading among wild birds and both farmed and wild mammals emerged, raising concern among health officials and independent scientists. That made it clear that this virus is different than past forms of avian influenza — and potentially a greater risk to humans.Last summer, thousands of dead seabirds began washing up on the shores of eastern Canada. That fall, meanwhile, avian flu infected large numbers of mink at a fur farm in northwestern Spain. On the farm, the virus picked up a genetic mutation that could make it better at replicating within mammalian cells, raising concerns that it could eventually jump over to humans.This form of HPAI virus has now spread to every continent other than Australia and Antarctica. Scientists now say it’s causing a “panzootic,” meaning a pandemic among animals, and health officials are racing to get it under control.What kinds of animals are getting infected?What makes the virus particularly troubling is that it infects an incredibly wide array of both farmed and wild animals. The list includes more than 150 species of wild birds — from terns to owls to vultures — including those that are already threatened with extinction for other reasons.Since March, for example, more than 20 endangered California condors in the Southwest have died, and most of them tested positive for avian flu. The largest bird in North America, with a wingspan that can reach more than 9 feet, the California condor almost went extinct in the 1980s due to lead poisoning and other factors. A successful captive breeding program revived the population, which now stands at roughly 550 worldwide.A California condor, the largest bird in North America. Richard Vogel/APThese sorts of die-offs are troubling, ecologists say.“Large die-offs can impact populations of these species for decades and may contribute to species collapse and further ecosystem damage, particularly given the critical declines seen in North American bird biodiversity over the last half century,” scientists wrote in the April study, which tallied reported and suspected cases of H5N1 in North American birds.Then there is the growing list of infected mammals. Outbreaks among mink and marine mammals have garnered the most attention; earlier this year, officials reported that bird flu killed almost 3,500 seal lions in Peru and thousands more in Chile. Officials have also detected the virus in dozens of other wild animal species including tigers, bears, otters, raccoons, coyotes, and dolphins. Some pet dogs and cats have also been infected (more on that below).How many birds have died?Globally, the current outbreak has killed — or forced farmers to cull — more than half a billion poultry worldwide, according to a preprint (i.e., not yet peer-reviewed) paper published in May. In the US, that number is roughly 59 million as of July 12.The toll the virus has taken on wild birds is more difficult to pinpoint.In the US, suspected or confirmed cases of H5N1 in wild birds are in the tens of thousands, according to a study published in April. Reporting by the Guardian revealed that the flu has killed more than 50,000 birds in the UK. In eastern Canada alone, roughly 40,000 birds have been reported as sick or dead, likely linked to the flu, as I previously reported.Most of these numbers are likely underestimates. Government agencies don’t have the resources to test every dead bird. Plus, many individuals die out at sea, or in rural areas that lack surveillance. In reality, the total number of dead birds is likely in the millions globally, according to the preprint.Dozens of eggs seen in North Bergen, New Jersey, on January 10, 2023. Seth Wenig/APIs bird flu still inflating egg prices?As avian flu swept through poultry farms last year, farmers killed millions of birds. Fewer birds meant fewer eggs, and fewer eggs sent egg prices soaring. In December of 2021, the US had roughly 328 million egg-laying hens; a year later, that number had fallen to about 308 million.While avian flu is still spreading among wild animals globally, health officials and farmers have largely managed to curtail infection among poultry in recent months, at least in the US. And that’s caused egg prices to drop. The wholesale cost of a dozen eggs in the US is now just over a dollar, compared to around $5 in parts of the country earlier this year.Can humans get bird flu?Yes, we can, though infection is highly uncommon.Prior to the current outbreak, several hundred people had been infected by H5N1 viruses (similar to the one spreading today) and more than half of them died, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.But that should not alarm you. Even though avian flu is currently somewhat widespread among birds and some mammals, it rarely spreads to humans, according to the WHO. Since late 2021, when the virus was going global, health officials have only reported eight cases of H5N1 infection in humans. At least one of them, an 11-year-old girl in Cambodia, died.Nearly all cases of human infection involve people interacting with loads of sick birds on poultry farms. That indicates that the virus is likely only capable of infecting a human if they are exposed to an enormous viral load.What are the symptoms of bird flu?Sick birds can shed the virus through their saliva, mucus, and droppings. Humans risk infection when these infectious substances get into their eyes, nose, or mouth. (Fortunately, most people naturally want to avoid bird poop in their mouths.)What’s a bit confusing about bird flu symptoms is that they can vary a lot — and they can overlap with those of other respiratory diseases including Covid-19. Symptoms can be nonexistent or subtle, such as eye redness or a mild flu, or show up as a high fever (above 100 degrees Fahrenheit) and pneumonia. Coughs, sore throats, congestion, body aches, headaches, fatigue, difficulty breathing, and diarrhea have also been linked to bird flu, according to the CDC.If you’ve been exposed to birds infected with avian influenza, you should monitor yourself for any signs of illness for 10 days, per the CDC. And if you have any of them, err on the side of caution and contact your local health department. (Here’s a directory.)A chicken at a farm in Illinois. Erin Hooley/APCould bird flu become a human pandemic?The avian influenza virus circulating today is almost certainly incapable of spreading dangerous infections to people around the planet. Simply put, it does not have the proper biological machinery to easily invade — let alone circulate among — humans. If you want to go a layer deeper, here’s how my coworker Dr. Keren Landman (a physician) and I explained it earlier this year:To infiltrate a host, viruses first have to bind to certain receptors on the surface of their cells. The virus that’s currently spreading, H5N1, does this using a specific kind of protein known as hemagglutinin 5, or H5. You can think of H5 as a key and receptors as the locks.Following this metaphor, H5 can unlock certain receptors found in cells that line the respiratory and digestive tracts of birds. By invading those cells and replicating, the virus can damage these vital systems, making it difficult for the birds to breathe and easy for them to spread the virus among themselves (through breath and feces).Humans have some similar, avian-type receptors in our respiratory systems, too. But for reasons scientists don’t fully understand, they don’t make us as vulnerable to avian flu as birds are. Critically, we also have a higher number of different, non-avian-type receptor that bird flu viruses don’t like to bind to quite as much. The abundance of those non-avian receptors in our noses seems to protect us from being easily infected by viruses like H5N1.The bottom line: In its current form, the virus doesn’t easily bind to cells in our airways, so it’s harder for the virus to infect us.But even if HPAI could easily infect humans, and replicate within our cells, it wouldn’t necessarily become a public health emergency. Typically, for a virus to cause a pandemic, it must be human-to-human transmissible — particularly through the air, like how SARS-CoV-2 spreads — and, at this time, there’s no indication that this virus has that ability.“With the information available so far, the virus does not appear to be able to transmit from one person to another easily,” said Dr. Sylvie Briand, WHO’s director of epidemic and pandemic preparedness and prevention, in a recent press release.So why are health officials concerned?Viruses evolve quickly, and unpredictably. Not only do they mutate, but they can also swap entire portions of their genomes with other viruses — creating new frankenviruses — if two or more of them infect the same host. Under the right circumstances, this evolution could give the virus the tools to replicate more easily in mammals, which would make them more threatening to humans. That’s what makes the outbreak among wild birds today so concerning. The more the virus spreads, the more opportunities it has to evolve dangerous traits.During most past outbreaks, only poultry farms were badly infected, so farmers and health officials could kill giant flocks of infected farm birds and exercise other biosecurity measures to stem the spread. But now that wild birds are a reservoir for HPAI, containment is much, much harder. Indeed, no matter how much culling farmers do, wild flocks could still pass H5N1 over to domestic populations.Once wild birds contaminate farms, the risks skyrocket. Viruses evolve much more quickly within animals that are packed tightly together, simply because they have more bodies to grow in. On farms, they’re also known to pick up adaptations that make them better equipped to replicate among mammals, Wendy Puryear, a molecular virologist at Tufts University, told Vox earlier this year. (It’s not clear why).Another challenge is that when the virus is widespread among wild birds, it has more opportunities to spill over directly into mammals. That’s how all those seals and mink and other mammals likely got sick, Puryear said — they came into contact with infected birds. And as these microbes replicate within their cells, the flu viruses can pick up traits that make them more harmful to humans.A harbor seal near Portland, Maine. Robert F. Bukaty/APThis is not just theoretical. In a recent study, Puryear found that some H5N1 viruses infecting seals in New England had genetic changes that have been shown to make them more efficient at replicating within the cells of mammals. Researchers have found similar adaptations in H5N1 viruses found in foxes and mink. Studies in wild birds and poultry have also identified mutations that may make the virus better at binding to “human-like receptors,” according to the WHO’s recent statement. “Studies are underway to identify any changes in the virus that may help the virus to spread more easily among mammals, including humans,” the WHO said.What about dogs and cats?Although it’s rare, both dogs and cats can catch bird flu. Earlier this summer, veterinary officials reported that at least 16 cats died in Poland and tested positive for H5N1 bird flu, according to the Netherlands-based news agency BNO News. It’s the first time avian influenza has been linked to a large die-off in cats.Influenza in pet dogs and cats is, in most cases, linked to the consumption of sick birds or infected raw meat. Last spring, for example, a pet dog in Canada died from H5N1 after chewing on a dead goose. So a simple way to protect your animals is to keep them indoors or on a leash. You should also avoid feeding them raw meat from game birds or poultry, according to the government of Canada.Keep an eye out for symptoms of bird flu, which include fever, exhaustion, pink eye, lack of appetite, difficulty breathing or other respiratory symptoms, and neurological signs (such as tremors or seizures), per the Canadian government.Is there a human vaccine for bird flu?Yes. The US government has a stockpile of vaccines, including those specifically for H5N1, according to the CDC. “Since flu viruses change constantly, CDC continues to make candidate vaccine viruses (CVVs) as needed,” the CDC states.Meanwhile, companies that manufacture vaccines say they could quickly make millions of flu shots, Reuters reported. Last spring, three companies including GSK and Moderna told the news agency that they’re developing vaccines designed to strengthen the human immune system against the particular type of HPAI spreading today.“It’s not Covid,” Puryear said, referencing how there were no coronavirus vaccines stockpiled when the pandemic hit. “In theory, we should be able to respond quickly if this becomes an issue.”One big caveat: Should we need bird flu vaccines, a large portion of them will likely go to rich countries first, leaving more vulnerable nations at risk.What about a vaccine for birds?Yes, there are some effective bird vaccines for H5N1 on the global market, as my colleague Kenny Torrella has written; countries including Egypt, Mexico, and Indonesia are already using them.In the past, the USDA has licensed a handful of bird flu vaccines, though none of them are approved for the current strain, according to the American Medical Veterinary Association. Still, the USDA hasn’t approved them for actual use in mass vaccination campaigns on farms, Torrella writes, due to something called the “DIVA problem”:DIVA is short for “differentiating infected from vaccinated animals” — the challenge of identifying whether a bird is actually infected with avian influenza, or just has avian influenza antibodies after vaccination. Countries fear that importing eggs or slaughtered meat from vaccinated birds in countries where the virus is circulating could inadvertently spread it within their own borders by introducing the virus to wild or domesticated animals through discarded raw meat.That means that big poultry exporters like the US — which sends 18 percent of its poultry abroad — don’t vaccinate, for fear they’ll miss out on a huge part of their revenue: international trade.That said, the USDA began testing several potential bird flu vaccines in April to see how well they might respond to the current strain of influenza virus. Vaccines could be commercially available within 18 to 24 months, the agency said in April. Several other countries are also testing influenza vaccines for birds.Separately, USDA has approved the emergency use of a bird flu vaccine for the critically endangered California condors “in an attempt to prevent additional deaths of these birds.” Veterinary officials will start vaccine trials for condors later this month, according to Joanna Gilkeson, a spokesperson for the US Fish and Wildlife Service.How can I help?If you have pets, prevent them from interacting with infected birds. That means keeping your cat indoors and your dog on a leash.You can also help monitor the outbreak, especially if you already spend a lot of time outdoors looking for wildlife. Birders are “the eyes and ears of this panzootic,” Nichola Hill, an infectious disease ecologist at the University of Massachusetts Boston, told Vox earlier this year. “I don’t think they’re being harnessed enough.”While people are used to photographing beautiful wildlife on their phones and uploading it to platforms like iNaturalist, right now it’s more important that they document dead birds, she said. (iNaturalist actually has a webpage exactly for this purpose.) If you find a dead wild bird and are not sure what to do, check out this one-pager from the USDA.Tips, comments, or questions?

The attributable risk of influenza due to temperature and the corresponding driving factors were unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the spatial distribution characteristics of attributable risk of Influenza-like illness (ILI) caused by adverse temperatures and explore the related driving factors in the United States.MethodsILI, meteorological factors, and PM2.5 of 48 states in the United States were collected during 2011–2019. The time-stratified case-crossover design with a distributed lag non-linear model was carried out to evaluate the association between temperature and ILI at the state level. The multivariate meta-analysis was performed to obtain the combined effects at the national level. The attributable fraction (AF) was calculated to assess the ILI burden ascribed to adverse temperatures. The ordinary least square model (OLS), spatial lag model (SLM), and spatial error model (SEM) were utilized to identify driving factors.ResultsA total of 7,716,115 ILI cases were included in this study. Overall, the temperature was negatively associated with ILI risk, and lower temperature gave rise to a higher risk of ILI. AF ascribed to adverse temperatures differed across states, from 49.44% (95% eCI: 36.47% ~ 58.68%) in Montana to 6.51% (95% eCI: -6.49% ~ 16.46%) in Wisconsin. At the national level, 29.08% (95% eCI: 27.60% ~ 30.24%) of ILI was attributable to cold. Per 10,000 dollars increase in per-capita income was associated with the increment in AF (OLS: β = -6.110, P = 0.021; SLM: β = -5.496, P = 0.022; SEM: β = -6.150, P = 0.022).ConclusionThe cold could enhance the risk of ILI and result in a considerable proportion of ILI disease burden. The ILI burden attributed to cold varied across states and was higher in those states with lower economic status. Targeted prevention programs should be considered to lower the burden of influenza. Peer Review reports BackgroundInfluenza is a common respiratory disease caused by the influenza virus. It spreads mainly from person to person via airborne droplets and direct contact and has the characteristics of strong infectivity and rapid transmission [1]. According to the estimation from World Health Organization, there were 290,000 to 650,000 influenza-associated deaths per year worldwide [2]. In the United States (US), the estimated influenza burden was 36 million influenza-related illnesses, 16 million influenza-related medical visits, 390,000 influenza-related hospitalizations, and 25,000 influenza-related deaths for 2019–2020 [3]. Therefore, influenza has been a significant public health issue.Previous studies found that meteorological factors could exert a key influence on influenza activity, especially temperature [4, 5]. A study from Netherlands demonstrated lower temperature was statistically associated with a higher weekly ILI incidence rate [6]. Li Y et al. [7] observed that the association between temperature and influenza presented an approximate “S” shape in Wuhan, China. The hot and cold were both associated with influenza. A study by Carlos R. Oliveira et al. [8] showed no association between temperature and ILI in Salvador, Brazil. Prior studies focused on assessing the association between temperature and influenza in terms of relative risk, with few estimates of the attributable risk due to temperature, such as attributable fraction (AF) and attributable number. Relative risk only offered the impact of a specific temperature on influenza, which presented restricted information on the actual influence of temperature. The AF assessed the proportion of cases of a disease that would not have occurred absent exposure, which better reflected the overall disease burden and disease prevention effectiveness [9]. It was crucial in formulating programs and evaluating the effect of influenza prevention.Previous studies were mainly performed in a single city or region using various analytical approaches and different model settings, limiting their results' comparability [7, 8, 10]. It did not facilitate further exploration of the differences and drivers of the associations between temperature and influenza. The discrepancies in previous research might result from differences in socioeconomic, demographic, and climatic characteristics [11]. Large-scale multicenter studies in multiple climatic regions or the whole country could provide more reliable evidence about diversity. A recent nationwide survey from China among 30 cities demonstrated that daily mean temperature and the daily influenza incidence showed an N-shaped curve with the peak risk temperature at 5.1℃. People living in south China were more vulnerable to sensitive ambient temperatures of 1.6℃–14.4℃ [12]. Presently, the attributable risk of influenza caused by adverse temperatures and the corresponding driving factors are unclear.In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of temperature on ILI in terms of relative risk and attributable risk across 48 contiguous US states; we further explored spatial distribution and driving factors of the effects. It could provide epidemiological evidence for developing targeted influenza prevention and control strategies and lower the burden of influenza.MethodsData collectionWe collected the data of ILI, outpatient visits and the percentage of influenza-like cases (ILI% = the number of influenza-like caseshe number of outpatient visits × 100%) for 48 contiguous states in the US from the 1st week of 2011 to the 52nd week of 2019 (1 January 2011 to 31 December 2019) from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly), which tracked ILI through the Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILI-Net). Florida was ruled out due to the lack of available data on ILI. ILI was defined as “fever (temperature of 100 F (37.8℃) or greater) plus a cough and/or a sore throat without a known cause other than influenza”.Meteorological data were downloaded from National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA, https://www.ncei.noaa.gov), consisting of daily mean temperature (°C), relative humidity (%), air pressure (kpa), wind speed (m/s), and daily cumulative precipitation (mm). Daily mean PM2.5 concentration (μg/m3) data were derived from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA, https://www.epa.gov/outdoor-air-quality-data). For each state, three monitor stations were selected from the north (east), central, and south (west), and values on the above factors from them were averaged to generate estimates for each state. Considering that ILI data were reported in weekly time units, we calculated the weekly averages of meteorological factors (except precipitation) and PM2.5 and weekly cumulative precipitation.Demographic and economic data, including the percentage of females, percentage of people under 5 years old, population, and per-capita income (in the past 12 months) for each state in US, were collected. The population was obtained from the 2010 and 2020 US Census (https://www.census.gov), and the mean value of 2010 and 2020 was adopted. Other factors were obtained from the American Community Survey (ACS, https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs) during 2011–2019, and their nine-year average values were used.Statistical analysisFirst stage analysis: estimating the state-specific associationTime-stratified case-crossover design with a distributed lag nonlinear model (DLNM) based on a conditional quasi-Poisson regression model was conducted to evaluate the association between temperature and ILI for each state. The "case-crossover design" is often used for individual data, and the analysis is performed using conditional logistic regression [13, 14]. Additionally, this design can also be used for aggregate data (e.g., number of incidences per day), and the analysis can also be conducted using conditional Poisson (or quasi-Poisson) regression in addition to conditional logistic regression [14,15,16,17]. Armstrong et al. compared conditional Poisson (including quasi-Poisson) and conditional logistic regression and found similar results for both analysis methods, while conditional quasi-Poisson regression can adjust for overdispersion and autocorrelation [15]. Previously the time-stratified case-crossover design combined with a conditional quasi-Poisson regression model was mainly used for daily time series data, where the strata were matched days based on the same day of the week, calendar month, and year. Control days were selected from the same day of the week, within the same calendar month and year [15,16,17]. The data in this study was weekly time series data, which cannot control for the "day of the week" effect. Since the government reported 52 weeks of results each year, we divided 4 consecutive weeks as a group (here, groups were similar to months, and there were 12 months but 13 groups per year). Therefore, control weeks in this study were selected from the same group, within the same year.The DLNM examined a nonlinear exposure–response association and a lag-response association by cross-basis function [18]. We fitted the exposure–response association using a natural cubic B-spline with 3 degrees of freedom (df) and the lag-response association using a natural cubic B-spline. To fully consider the delayed effects and harvesting effects of temperature, a maximum lag of 3 weeks was adopted [19]. Furthermore, models included natural cubic B spline with 3 df of relative humidity and PM2.5, the categorical variable of vacation as confounders, and log-transformed outpatient visits as an offset.For each state, based on the cumulative temperature–ILI associations from the above model, we reported the relative risk with 95% confidence interval (CI) for extreme cold (5th percentile of the temperature distribution), with the median of the temperature distribution as the reference. The number and fraction of ILI attributable to cold (below the median of temperature) were estimated using a previously described method [20, 21]. In brief, for each state, the cumulative relative risk corresponding to each week’s temperature was used to calculate the attributable number and AF. The attributable number of ILI caused by cold was calculated by adding the subsets of weeks with corresponding temperature (below the median of temperature) and its ratio with the number of ILI provided the AF. The 95% empirical confidence interval (eCI) for AF were calculated using Monte Carlo simulations.Second stage analysis: pooling the state-specific estimatesThe state-specific associations from the first stage analysis were combined to estimate the pooled effects of temperature on ILI at the national level using multivariate meta-analysis based on a random-effect model, as applied by previous studies [22, 23]. At the national level, the mean of the 5th percentile of temperature across all states was defined as extreme cold. And the mean of the 50th percentile of temperature distributions for all states was defined as the reference. Likewise, the relative risk with 95% CI for extreme cold was reported. The national AF was calculated by the ratio of the sum of the attributable number for all states to the total ILI cases.Third stage analysis: exploring the driving factors of AF distributionGlobal spatial autocorrelation was utilized to estimate the spatial correlation between AF of ILI due to cold, with global Moran's I as an indicator [24]. The statistically significant value of Moran's I indicates spatial autocorrelation. The greater the absolute value, the stronger the spatial autocorrelation [25]. To explore the impact of demographic, climatic, and economic factors on AF, non-spatial (ordinary least square model, OLS) and spatial regression models (spatial lag model and spatial error model, SLM and SEM) were carried out. The OLS model was applied to assess the relationship between driving factors and AF without considering spatial dependence. SLM and SEM could better investigate the relationship between AF and driving factors by describing spatial dependence as a lag or error term, respectively. SLM assumed that the AF values influenced each other in neighboring areas, and SEM assumed that the spatial dependence of OLS residuals was derived from the error, which might be due to the spatial dependence of neighboring areas [24, 26].Firstly, we fitted univariate models with state-specific characteristics, including the percentage of females, percentage of people under 5 years old, population, per-capita income, annual mean temperature, the mean temperature in winter (December-February), and annual relative humidity one at a time. And then the multivariate model was fit with statistically significant (P < 0.05) variables identified by the univariate models.Sensitivity analysisSensitivity analyses were performed to assess the stability of our results. First, we changed the df values for relative humidity and PM2.5 from 2 to 4. Second, we also repeated the analysis after excluding some states (Idaho, Delaware, Montana, Iowa, and North Dakota), where the number of weeks with zero counts of ILI accounted for more than one-eighth of the total weeks from 2011 to 2019. Third, the natural cubic B spline with 3 df of air pressure (kpa), wind speed (m/s), and precipitation (mm) were also included in the model.Statistical analysis softwareEstimating the state-specific association and pooling the state-specific estimates were performed using R software (version 4.0.5), with the ‘dlnm’ package to fit DLNM and the ‘mvmeta’ package to conduct the multivariate meta-analysis. Global spatial autocorrelation analysis, OLS, SLM, and SEM were conducted by GeoDa 1.18.0. A two-tailed P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.ResultsDescriptive analysisThis study included 7,716,115 ILI cases in the US between 2011 and 2019. During the study period, the cumulative number of ILI was higher in Virginia (N = 943,247), Louisiana (N = 671,171), and Georgia (N = 580,205). In contrast, the cumulative number of ILI was lower in Delaware (N = 7,785), Montana (N = 9,642), and New Hampshire (N = 9,997) (Table 1). A considerable variation in meteorological factors and PM2.5 was found among these states. It ranged from 5.86 °C to 20.33 °C for the temperature, 39.37% over 73.24% in for relative humidity, and 4.81ug/m3 over 10.2ug/m3 for PM2.5. Figure 1A and B showed the distribution of temperature and ILI% at different times. The ILI% in weeks with low temperature was higher than in other weeks with high temperature.Table 1 State-specific summary statistics for ILI, meteorological factors and PM2.5 for 48 states in the US from 2011 to 2019Full size tableFig. 1The spatial–temporal distribution of weekly mean temperature and ILI% for 48 states in the US.

From the curve, we observed that the ILI risk increased as the temperature lowered.Fig. 2Pooled cumulative exposure–response curves for associations between temperature and ILI at the national level (black solid curve). Grey dotted lines indicate 48 state-specific curvesFull size imageTable S1 showed the effects of extreme cold on ILI in each state, and the effects differed among states. The effects were stronger in New Mexico (Relative risk = 4.69, 95% CI: 3.72 ~ 5.92), North Dakota (Relative risk = 3.79, 95% CI: 2.45 ~ 5.85), and Washington (Relative risk = 3.66, 95% CI: 2.62 ~ 5.11).At the national level, extreme cold (-2.59 °C) was associated with a higher risk of ILI (Relative risk = 2.46, 95% CI: 2.26 ~ 2.68), compared with the reference temperature(12.82 °C). From an attribution risk perspective, the AF of ILI due to cold was 29.08% (95% eCI: 27.60% ~ 30.24%). Accordingly, these days resulted in 2,243,471 (95% eCI: 2,126,231 ~ 2,332,994) ILI cases in this study population. Spatial distributions of AFFigure 3 displayed the spatial distribution of AF in the US. The AF varied substantially among states. Table S2 reported each state’s attributable number and fraction of ILI associated with cold. The AF in Montana (AF = 49.44%, 95% eCI: 36.47% ~ 58.68%), Kansas (AF = 49.19%, 95% eCI: 40.75% ~ 56.42%) and Wyoming (AF = 47.91%, 95% eCI: 36.13% ~ 57.17%) were relatively high. The AF in District of Columbia (AF = 10.18%, 95% eCI: 2.52% ~ 17.12%) and New Jersey (AF = 19.77%, 95% eCI: 13.82% ~ 25.36%) were relatively low.Fig. 3The spatial distribution of AF of ILI ascribed to cold in the US during 2011–2019Full size imageDriving factors of the differences in the spatial distribution of AFIn global spatial autocorrelation analysis, Moran's I was 0.2142 (P < 0.05), which showed a positive spatial correlation of AF of ILI caused by cold. The spatial regression models were required. The models with a single factor found that the increment in AF was associated with per 1% increase in the percentage of females (OLS: β = -4.737, 95% CI = -8.471 ~ -1.003, P = 0.017; SLM: β = -3.689, 95% CI = -7.387 ~ 0.009, P = 0.051; SEM: β = -4.905, 95% CI = -9.452 ~ -0.358, P = 0.034) and per 10,000 dollars increase in per-capita income (OLS: β = -7.676, 95% CI = -12.719 ~ -2.633, P = 0.004; SLM: β = -6.573, 95% CI = -11.430 ~ -1.716, P = 0.008; SEM: β = -7.898, 95% CI = -13.366 ~ -2.430 P = 0.005). When per-capita income, percentage of females, and the population were simultaneously incorporated into a multivariate model. Only the impact of per 10,000 dollars increase in per-capita income on AF (OLS: β = -6.110, 95% CI = -11.120 ~ -1.100, P = 0.021; SLM: β = -5.496, 95% CI = -10.192 ~ -0.800, P = 0.022; SEM: β = -6.150, 95% CI = -11.430 ~ -0.870, P = 0.022) was observed (Table 2). For other factors, differences in the AF across states were not statistically associated with them.Table 2 Effects of state-specific factors in non-spatial and spatial regression modelsFull size tableSensitivity analysisSensitivity analysis showed that our models and results were stable and reliable (Table S3).DiscussionBased on 7,716,115 ILI cases across 48 states in the US, this study characterized the associations between temperature and ILI and found that cold was associated with a higher risk of ILI. In total, 29.08% of ILI could be attributed to cold, a considerable value at the national level. Moreover, AF varied across states, with Montana (AF = 49.44%, 95% eCI: 36.47% ~ 58.68%) higher than other states. In addition, it was found that economic status was the main driving factor, and people living in lower economic states were sensitive to cold.Our result of the association between cold and ILI coincided with most previous studies. Zhang Y et al. [27] showed that low temperatures led to more influenza cases in Shanghai. Peci A et al. [28] found a negative association of temperature with influenza virus infections that low temperature enhanced influenza activity in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. There were some hypotheses in favor of explaining the phenomenon that low temperatures increased the risk of influenza. Firstly, low temperatures may prolong the survival of the influenza virus and make more people stay indoors, increasing the chances of influenza virus infections [29, 30]. Secondly, inhalation of cold air causes cooling of the nasal epithelium, which could increase the viscosity of the mucous layer and reduce mucociliary clearance. It is favorable to viral spread within the respiratory tract [31]. Finally, low temperatures may affect host immunity, which makes the host more vulnerable to the influenza virus [32].On the other hand, several studies found no relationship between cold and influenza. Steven Yuk-Fai Lau et al. [33] suggested that low temperature was not linked to influenza infections in Hangzhou, China. A multicenter study from 45 prefectures in Japan observed the relationship between lower temperatures and higher ILI risks in about 65% of the prefectures. At the same time, the cold was not related to ILI in several areas [34]. This study found no association between cold and ILI in Wisconsin. Therefore, the multicenter research can comprehensively find the association characteristics between ambient temperature and ILI. In addition, some studies found that high temperatures positively impact the activity of influenza. Dai Q et al. [35] observed that low temperatures and high temperatures enhanced the risk of ILI and influenza in Jiangsu Province, China. However, the mechanism remained unclear. Apart from statistical methods and model parameters, heterogeneity of the relationships between temperature and influenza activity might arise from differences in various characteristics, such as humidity, rainfall, income, and health resources [36, 37].DLNM has recently been widely applied to investigate the relationship between temperature and influenza activity [12, 38]. It adjusted the seasonal and long-term trends by incorporating the smooth function for the “time” in the model. Most studies chose 7 df per year for the “time” or based on information criteria (such as Quasi Akaike information criteria) to choose df, mainly used for daily time series data. For studies with weekly time series data, the choice of df values for the “time” was yet to be a consensus [39,40,41]. The time-stratified case-crossover design combined with quasi-Poisson regression could control long-term trends and seasonality, and adjust for overdispersion and autocorrelation [15, 16, 42].Little knowledge was available about the disease burden of ILI attributable to cold. Our results showed that 29.08% (95% eCI: 27.60% ~ 30.24%) of ILI was caused by cold. A study conducted among 30 cities in China over the period 2016–2019 found 60% (95% eCI: 54.3% ~ 64.3%) of influenza incidence was attributed to ambient temperature during the days with sensitive temperatures (1.6℃–14.4℃) [12]. Differences in attributed risk in the two studies might be due to the diversity of socioeconomic and demographic characteristics and the difference in analytical approaches [43, 44]. The burden of ILI caused by cold cannot be ignored, which is vital for clinicians and public health officials who advise the public.Our results showed greater attributable burdens caused by cold could be observed in states with lower economic status. Many studies have demonstrated that the population in poorer areas always had a higher risk of influenza outcomes (infection, hospitalizations, and mortality) [45, 46]. The underlying mechanisms for the effect of the economy remained unclear, which might be explained by the following reasons: individuals with low economic status increased exposure to low temperatures indoors and outside [47]. In contrast, people with high economic status could better afford health-protecting behaviors [48]. Our findings highlighted that influenza prevention and protection measures should be implemented in poorer areas.In the relationship between temperature and ILI, the cold might increase the risk of ILI. However, no driving effect of temperature on the distribution of AF was found. For a specific state, the AF was computed from the cumulative relative risk for each week's temperature, so the lower temperature, the higher AF. On the other hand, the health effects of temperature were not only influenced by the temperature of the region but may also be influenced by other factors such as population adaptability and economy in the region [49,50,51]. Renjie Chen et al. [50] found that the mortality burden attributable to cold was more prominent in southern cities, while those for hot temperatures were in the opposite direction. Wenjuan Ma et al. [51] observed larger cold effects in southern cities and larger hot effects in northern cities. This phenomenon may be related to central heating in northern cities and the higher adaptability of the people in northern cities to cold than those in southern cities. Therefore, in a nationwide study, some states may have lower average temperatures, but the AF caused by low temperatures was not necessarily high due to factors such as high adaptive capacity and economic level, ultimately resulting in temperatures that do not effectively drive differences in the spatial distribution of AF values.There are several merits to this study. Firstly, 9 years of long-term time-series data and a relatively large sample size across 48 states in the US were applied, which helped enhance the reliability and representativeness of the findings. Secondly, we estimated the relative risk of ILI associated with extreme cold and the attributable fractions caused by cold at the state and national levels to provide novel evidence. Thirdly, this study filled the gap in evidence regarding spatial variation and driving factors of the association between temperature and ILI in the US.Several potential limitations need to be noted in this study. Firstly, since only state-level summary data on ILI was available, we used state-level ambient temperature from outdoor monitors as exposure. It might give rise to exposure measurement errors. Secondly, this study used outdoor meteorological data without considering the impact of indoor meteorological conditions, which may affect flu virus transmission. Thirdly, influenza vaccination might reduce reportable flu-like cases, illness severity, and possible deaths. However, due to data limitations, this study did not consider the effects of influenza vaccines on temperature effects. Fourthly, we only adjusted PM2.5 and not adjusted other pollutants (such as CO and NO2) due to the high proportion of missing data.ConclusionsIn summary, this nationwide study indicated that cold could enhance the risk of ILI and result in a considerable ILI disease burden. The distribution of the AF ascribed to cold differed across states of the US, and it was higher in the states with lower economic status. Our findings provide evidence for developing targeted influenza prevention programs and lowering the influenza burden.

The FDA approved the vaccines in May. Both vaccines are indicated for the prevention of lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV. They are administered in a single dose and are expected to be available this fall. Review Details The Academy’s Commission on Health of the Public and Science recommended approval on July 12 after the expedited review, and AAFP Board Chair Sterling Ransone, M.D., FAAFP, accepted the recommendation the following day. At the same time, the Academy approved the CDC’s vaccination recommendations for the 2023-2024 influenza season. Although most people infected with RSV experience mild illness and recover in one or two weeks, some populations, such as older adults, are more likely to develop a severe infection leading to pneumonia or bronchiolitis. The CDC estimates that each year, 60,000 to 160,000 older adults are hospitalized and 6,000 to 10,000 die due to RSV infection. Adults with chronic heart or lung disease, and those with weakened immune systems, also have higher odds of severe RSV infection. Antibody to Protect Infants, Young Children Gains Approval In separate news, the FDA on July 17 approved the use of nirsevimab, a monoclonal antibody developed by Sanofi and AstraZeneca, to prevent lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV infection in newborns and infants burn during or entering their first RSV season, and in children up to 24 months old who remain vulnerable to severe RSV disease through their second season. The drug will be sold under the brand name Beyfortus and administered as a single intramuscular injection prior to or during RSV season. The FDA said Beyfortus should be administered with caution to infants and children with clinically significant bleeding disorders, and should not be administered to infants and children with a history of serious hypersensitivity reactions to any of its active or inactive ingredients. Although nirsevimab is expected to be available in the United States ahead of the 2023-2024 RSV season, it must first clear additional regulatory hurdles, starting with the CDC’s ACIP. The committee issued draft recommendations and clinical considerations for the use of nirsevimab in the pediatric setting in February and is expected to vote in October on a final recommendation, which would then go to the CDC’s director for endorsement. The AAFP will review any decisions made by FDA and CDC in determining whether to formally approve nirsevimab’s use. According to the CDC, between 58,000 and 80,000 children younger than 5 years are hospitalized because of RSV infection each year. Infants born prematurely, those younger than 6 months old and children with weakened immune systems are among those at greatest risk for severe illness from RSV infection. Family physicians are encouraged to visit the Academy’s RSV Vaccine webpage for the latest information on vaccines for RSV and other infectious diseases.

In a statement on Monday, the U.N. health agency said it was the first time so many cats had been reported to have bird flu over such a wide geographical area in a single country, amid an unprecedented global outbreak of the latest version of the H5N1 version of the disease. WHO said that late last month, Polish authorities informed agency officials of the unusual deaths of more than 45 cats in 13 geographical regions of the country. Testing last week found that 29 had H5N1. WATCH: What you need to know about the U.S. bird flu outbreak As of June, the most recent variant of H5N1 has been reported in birds and other animal species in Asia, Africa, Europe and the Americas. Since 2020, WHO said a dozen human cases have been reported. Scientists worry that rising cases of H5N1, particularly in animals that have frequent contact with humans, might lead to a mutated version of the disease that could spread easily between people, triggering another pandemic. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, many experts had suspected that the next global outbreak would be sparked by H5N1. But while bird flu has killed hundreds of millions of birds globally, it has sickened fewer than 900 people since 2003 and has not been able to spread easily among humans. WHO said it was unclear how the domestic cats in Poland became infected with bird flu and said officials were still investigating possible sources of exposure, including contact with wild birds that are known to carry H5N1. The agency said the risk of people in Poland being infected with bird flu was “low” and “low to moderate” for people exposed to cats, including cat owners and veterinarians. Last week, WHO and partners warned that the increasing numbers of mammals infected with H5N1 were unusual. Experts have previously cautioned that pigs, which are susceptible to flu viruses from both humans and birds, might act as a “mixing vessel,” leading to the emergence of mutated viruses that could be lethal to people. Since last year, authorities in 10 countries have reported bird flu outbreaks in mammals, including farmed mink in Spain, seals in the U.S., and sea lions in Peru and Chile.

Of the 47 samples tested (46 from cats and one from a caracal, another type of feline), 29 were positive for the avian influenza A(H5N1) virus. The surveillance period for all contacts has now ended and no contacts have shown symptoms. According to WHO, "sporadic A(H5N1) infections of cats have been reported previously, but this is the first report of a large number of infected cats in a large geographical area within a country". SMC Spain 18/07/2023 - 11:29 CEST Versión en castellano Expert reactions Nogales - Gatos (EN) Aitor Nogales González Virologist (senior scientist) at the Animal Health Research Centre (CISA, INIA-CSIC) Center for Animal Health Research (CISA) National Institute for Agricultural and Food Research and Technology (INIA-CSIC) Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) Science Media Centre Spain On 27 June 2023, the Polish authorities notified the World Health Organisation (WHO) of the death of 46 cats and one caracal. Most of the samples tested from the dead or slaughtered animals were positive for avian influenza subtype H5N1 and clade 2.3.4.4b, which has been responsible for multiple outbreaks of avian influenza in poultry farms in Europe. In addition, the animals developed symptoms compatible with avian influenza infection. The affected animals come from different geographical areas of the country. The source of exposure of the animals to the virus is currently unknown and investigations are ongoing to determine how the infections occurred, which could be through direct or indirect contact with infected birds, or through consumption of contaminated feed, among other causes. It is important to note that none of the people who had close contact with the animals have developed symptoms related to possible infection with the virus. Previously, sporadic cases of infection in domestic or wild felines with avian influenza subtype H5N1 have been described, and it was known that felines are susceptible to this virus. However, this time the high number of reported cases is striking. Given the increase in the number of mammalian cases that have been infected with avian influenza subtype H5N1, the situation should continue to be monitored through active surveillance systems. In addition, it is important to assess the evolution of the virus in order to predict possible adaptations to mammals, including humans. It should be recalled that avian influenza has been a key player in recent influenza pandemics. The author has not responded to our request to declare conflicts of interest Language EN Gustavo - Gatos (EN) Gustavo del Real Researcher at the Center for Research on Influenza Pathogenesis and Transmission (CRIPT) at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, USA and researcher at the National Institute for Agrarian and Food Research and Technology (INIA-CSIC) National Institute for Agricultural and Food Research and Technology (INIA-CSIC) Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) Science Media Centre Spain Three weeks ago, Poland's competent animal health authority notified the WHO of the death of an unusually high number of cats in different regions of the country. The sick cats suffered from severe respiratory, digestive and neurological symptoms and autopsies showed pneumonia lesions. Among the affected cats, five were living indoors, 18 were living indoors with access to a terrace or garden and two were living outdoors. Analysis showed that 29 out of 47 samples from the suspected cats tested positive for the H5N1 Influenza A virus. Genetic analysis of the virus isolates revealed that they belong to the H5 2.3.4.4b clade, similar to the H5N1 2.3.4.4b strain that had recently circulated in wild birds and caused outbreaks in poultry in Poland. As is known, since the end of 2021, countless outbreaks of H5N1 have been reported in wild birds and poultry worldwide. Sporadic avian influenza infections in cats had already been detected in different parts of the world, but the novelty of this outbreak is that it has affected a large number of cats in a large geographical area of a country in a short time. The fact that the infections have occurred almost simultaneously at several distant sites seems to indicate that the infections have been caused independently by direct or indirect contact with infected birds and, in principle, there is no evidence of transmission between cats. Also, no signs of infection have been reported in people close to the affected cats (owners, veterinarians, etc.). Cats have already shown susceptibility to infection by avian influenza viruses, as well as by other RNA viruses, such as the covid-19 coronavirus, in this case from SARS-CoV-2 infected humans, illustrating the special relevance of this pet as a potential intermediate host for viruses that also affect humans and other mammals. The most relevant aspect of these episodes is that cats join the group of mammalian species (wild, farm and pet) that in the last two years have been infected by the H5N1 highly virulent avian influenza virus that is circulating worldwide and that, between 2020 and 2022, has affected seven people and caused two deaths. Polish health authorities are investigating the factors that have led to the infection of cats and have deployed a series of preventive measures among cat owners to avoid contact with birds suspected of being infected with avian influenza. The WHO reiterates the importance of epidemiological surveillance of these viruses, with special emphasis on animal species susceptible to infection that may facilitate their adaptation and spread to humans.

Pictured: Flu vaccine vials and syringe/iStock, vchal Topline data from the Phase II PENINSULA study showed that Vir Biotechnology’s investigational flu shot VIR-2482 fell short of its primary and all secondary efficacy endpoints, the biotech announced Thursday. Patients inoculated with the highest 1,200-mg dose of the vaccine candidate saw a 16% drop in influenza A-like illness as compared with placebo, an effect that did not satisfy statistical significance, according to Vir’s news release. PENINSULA defined this primary endpoint as PCR-confirmed influenza A infection with at least one respiratory and one systemic symptom. Phil Pang, Vir’s chief medical officer, called these findings “disappointing” in a statement, but nevertheless said that the company needs to conduct further analysis to “better understand these outcomes.” Vir plans to present these analyses at a future major medical congress. PENINSULA is double-blinded, randomized and placebo-controlled study with approximately 3,000 adult patients enrolled. VIR-2482 was given as a 450-mg or 1,200-mg intramuscular dose. To be eligible, participants had to be free from risk factors that could predispose them to serious influenza complications, and they were not to have a flu vaccine for the upcoming flu season. Among the study’s secondary endpoints is symptomatic influenza-like illness as defined by having a fever and cough and/or a sore throat, as per CDC guidelines. Compared with placebo, the highest dose of VIR-2482 elicited 57.25% relative risk reduction in this efficacy metric. As for safety, PENINSULA results showed that the vaccine candidate was generally well tolerated and documented no concerning signals. VIR-2482 is an investigational intramuscular monoclonal antibody that targets the hemagglutinin glycoprotein found on the surface of influenza viruses and which is crucial for their infectious activity. The vaccine candidate was designed to be prophylactic against all major strains of influenza A and to elicit protection without relying on the recipients to produce their own immune response. In February 2021, GSK dropped $225 million and added $120 million to its equity investment in Vir to expand an ongoing collaboration to develop novel, potentially best-in-class therapies for influenza and other respiratory diseases. As part of this expanded deal, GSK earned the exclusive option to co-develop VIR-2482 after Phase II results. Following Thursday’s disappointing data drop, the future of the GSK collaboration has “yet to be determined” and the partners are in “ongoing discussions,” a Vir spokesperson told Endpoints News. GSK and Vir first entered into a research and development partnership in April 2020 for COVID-19. In February 2023, however, GSK stepped back from the coronavirus portion of the partnership but stayed engaged for VIR-2482 and other respiratory virus programs.Tristan Manalac is an independent science writer based in metro Manila, Philippines.

Deal on PAHPA Extension The Senate HELP Committee has agreed to a clean 5-year extension of priority review vouchers and a study on alternative incentives to biomedical research that delink research costs from the price of drugs. The new proposals are part of a manager’s amendments to the committee’s original Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act (PAHPA) draft. The amendment also includes a section on policies to prevent drug shortages, which continues to divide lawmakers in the House of Representatives. Axios Funding for Antimicrobial Incentives Unlikely in Any PAHPA Version Over 200 industry groups and nonprofit organizations have urged Congress to include the Pioneering Antimicrobial Subscriptions to End Up Surging Resistance, or PASTEUR Act, in the PAHPA reauthorization. The bill, which has been introduced three years in a row, proposes a subscription-based funding model for antibiotics that would require the government to pay drug companies a flat annual rate for novel antibiotics based on their value to public health. The measure is intended to spur development of the needed but often unprofitable medications. To the distress of antibiotics developers, PASTEUR will likely need to find another way. The act is not included in either the House or the Senate’s current versions of the bill, and lawmakers don’t appear keen to tack on the additional $6 billion needed to fund the program. PharmaVoice Africa CDC, WHO and RKI Launch Health Security Partnership to Strengthen Disease Surveillance in Africa The partnership aims to strengthen Africa’s health security capabilities in the areas of biosecurity, integrated disease surveillance, event-based surveillance, genomic surveillance, and epidemic intelligence. The first phase will be implemented in six African Union Member States including The Gambia, Mali, Morocco, Namibia, Tunisia, and South Africa and will later be expanded to additional countries. WHO Biden Administration Moves to Ban Funding for Wuhan Lab HHS is taking steps to impose a 10-year ban on funding for the Wuhan Institute of Virology, according to a memo made public by the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic. The memo said the institute had failed to comply with repeated requests from the National Institutes of Health for laboratory notebooks and other documents necessary to establish its safety practices. The NIH’s conclusion that the Wuhan institute “likely violated protocols of the NIH regarding biosafety is undisputed.” The institute, which has not received any federal money since 2020, was afforded 30 days to respond to the notice. New York Times National Security Memorandum on Strengthening the Security and Resilience of United States Food and Agriculture This week the FDA, USDA and Department of Homeland Security made available the 120 Day Food and Agriculture Interim Risk Review, which provides a review of critical and emergent risks to the U.S. Food and Agriculture sector, as well as ways to mitigate those risks. This review will help inform the Federal Risk Mitigation Strategy. FDA Biden’s NIH Nominee is Languishing in Congress — Alarming Public Health Advocates Sen. Bernie Sanders’ rare move to delay President Biden’s health care nominees has put the drug pricing firebrand and the White House in a standoff — and public health advocates worry the feud could squeeze out an otherwise uncontroversial pick to lead the country’s top science agency. STAT S. 1798, Offices of Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction and Health Security Act of 2023 S. 1798 would permanently reauthorize the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office (CWMD) within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). CWMD leads DHS’s efforts to prevent the use of chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear weapons, and promotes readiness against such attacks by coordinating with federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial governments, as well as the private sector. Under current law, CWMD’s authorization expires on December 21, 2023. S. 1798 also would create an Office of Health Security (OHS) within DHS. That office would assume responsibility for all the department’s medical and public health activities that are currently handled by other offices, including food, agriculture, and veterinary defense, as well as workforce health and safety. CBO estimates that implementing S. 1798 would cost $1.6 billion over the 2024-2028 period. Congressional Budget Office White House Planning to Tap Retired General to Lead New Pandemic Office Maj. Gen. Paul Friedrichs, who retired from the military this summer and joined the National Security Council to work on biodefense and global health security, is reportedly the planned selection to lead the White House’s Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy. The office was created by congressional legislation last year but has been beset by staffing delays and persistent questions about its leadership. Friedrichs, who served as joint staff surgeon at the Pentagon and helped coordinate the military’s pandemic response, worked closely with the White House on rolling out coronavirus vaccines and ramping up global efforts to fight the virus. Washington Post Diluting the Role of USDA Veterinarians is a Mistake According to Those on the Job at FSIS The USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service plans to dilute the role of veterinarians in animal slaughter. It is a change made during a persistent and severe national DVM shortage. But those Doctors of Veterinary Medicine (DVMs) at USDA believe fewer veterinarians put both food safety and consumer protection at risk. The forecasts for the shortage of DMVs are expected to continue for the rest of the decade when there will still be an unmet need for 15,000 veterinarians. Food Safety News US Congressional Hearing Produces Heat But No Light on COVID-Origins Debate The polarization of US politics was on full display at Tuesday’s hearing. While Republican members of the committee hammered Andersen and Garry with allegations of conflicts of interest and collusion with government scientists, Democratic members praised the scientists’ work and accused the Republicans of making it more difficult to uncover the true origin of the pandemic. Nature Scientists, Under Fire From Republicans, Defend Fauci and Covid Origins Study Two world-renowned virologists appeared on Capitol Hill on Tuesday and delivered a pointed defense of their findings that the coronavirus pandemic was natural in origin, and told skeptical Republicans that Dr. Anthony S. Fauci did not exert influence over a scientific paper they wrote to that effect. Republican members of the panel tried in vain to lecture the virologists, sometimes making outright incorrect claims. New York Times UK Covid Inquiry Hears Call for More Cash for Public Health The Government Office for Science told the closing of the Covid-19 public inquiry investigation into the UK’s preparedness that the government should follow South Korea with a “better developed and funded public health system” that would improve public health in peacetime and pivot to test and trace in a pandemic. The intervention came after the inquiry heard of sweeping cuts to public health systems before the pandemic and that health officials based in town halls were “ignored by central government in the planning for a pandemic”. The Guardian MEDICAL COUNTERMEASURES Ebola Vaccine Candidate Protects Mice Against Lethal Surrogate Ebola and Yellow Fever Virus Challenge Yellow Fever Virus (YFV) and Ebola Virus (EBOV) share their endemicity, a single vaccine that could simultaneously contribute to the elimination of yellow fever epidemics and combat surges of EVD would be of great benefit in routine immunization programs in endemic regions. Here researchers present data on the development of such a dual-target YF17D-vectored Ebola vaccine candidate (YF-EBO) expressing EBOV GP from a replication-competent full-length YF17D backbone. A single shot of YF-EBO induces both EBOV- and YFV-specific humoral and cellular immune responses in mice. NPJ Vaccines Advancements in Marburg (MARV) Virus Vaccine Research with its Recent Reemergence in Equatorial Guinea and Tanzania This scoping review provides MARV pathology and pathogenesis, related morbidities, existing therapies, established outbreak protocols as well as areas of opportunities. Efforts to continue ongoing vaccine research have been reignited since the recent outbreak in 2023 concerning which the CDC issued a travel alert against traveling to Equatorial Guinea and Tanzania. The recent outbreaks, albeit with fewer reported mortalities than historical outbreaks, have spurred on WHO as well as other experts in the field to refocus their efforts on MARV vaccine research. Cureus Immunogenicity of Poxvirus-Based Vaccines Against Nipah Virus Nipah virus (NiV), an emerging zoonotic pathogen in Southeast Asia, has killed millions of animals and caused highly fatal human outbreaks. This study characterized the immunogenicity and safety of poxvirus-based Nipah vaccines that can be used in humans and species responsible for NiV transmission. Mice were vaccinated with modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) and raccoon pox (RCN) viral vectors expressing the NiV fusion and glycoprotein proteins subcutaneously and intranasally. Scientific Reports Art of the Kill: Designing and Testing Viral Inactivation Procedures for Highly Pathogenic Negative Sense RNA Viruses The study of highly pathogenic viruses handled under BSL-4 conditions and classified as Select Agents frequently involves the transfer of inactivated materials to lower containment levels for downstream analyses. This paper provide a workflow for various inactivation methods of Ebola, Nipah, and Lassa viruses, highlighting the challenges of each method and provide possible solutions. Pathogens Intranasal Influenza-Vectored COVID-19 Vaccine Restrains the SARS-Cov-2 Inflammatory Response in Hamsters Researchers investigate immune responses induced by an NS1-deleted influenza virus vectored intranasal COVID-19 vaccine (dNS1-RBD) which provides broad-spectrum protection against SARS-CoV-2 variants in hamsters. Intranasal delivery of dNS1-RBD induces innate immunity, trained immunity and tissue-resident memory T cells covering the upper and lower respiratory tract. It restrains the inflammatory response by suppressing early phase viral load post SARS-CoV-2 challenge and attenuating pro-inflammatory cytokine levels. Nature Communications Vaccine Adjuvants: Mechanisms and Platforms Despite advances in the development of adjuvants, there is little systematic generalization and summary of the action mechanisms of adjuvants due to their broad definitions and complex mechanisms. Moreover, due to the lack of systematic and in-depth understanding of the mechanisms, characteristics, immune effectiveness, and application scenarios of the current adjuvant platforms, it is difficult to match and design appropriate adjuvants for specific vaccines. This has led current vaccines gradually showing shortcomings in their use, such as the inability to provide long-term protective immunity, weak immunity in elderly populations, and the inability to provide effective cellular immunity. Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy Mannich Phenols as Reactivators of Human Acetylcholinesterase Inhibited by A-Series Nerve Agents The A-series (novichoks) are the most recent generation of chemical warfare nerve agents (CWA) which act directly on the inhibition of the human acetylcholinesterase (HssAChE) enzyme. These compounds lack accurate experimental data on their physicochemical properties, and there is no evidence that traditional antidotes effectively reactivate HssAChE inhibited by them. In the search for potential antidotes, here researchers employed virtual screening, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics simulations for the assessment of Mannich phenols as potential reactivators of HssAChE inhibited by the Novichok agents in comparison with the commercial oximes pralidoxime, asoxime, trimedoxime, and obidoxime. Chemico-Biological Interactions Using AI to Speed Up Vaccine Development Against Disease X CEPI to provide up to $4.98 USD million to research consortium to use artificial intelligence for design of vaccines to fight diseases with pandemic potential. These AI approaches will be used to identify target pieces of protein in the virus that stimulate the immune system, known as epitopes. The consortium will initially focus their efforts on paramyxoviruses and arenaviruses, viral families which include the likes of Nipah virus and Lassa virus, respectively. CEPI Single-Dose VSV-Based Vaccine Protects Cynomolgus Macaques from Disease After Taï Forest Virus Infection Taï Forest virus (TAFV) is a lesser-known ebolavirus that causes lethal infections in chimpanzees and is responsible for a single human case. Limited research has been done on this human pathogen; however, with the recent emergence of filoviruses in West Africa, further investigation and countermeasure development against this virus is warranted. Following a single high-dose vaccination, NHPs developed antigen-specific binding and neutralizing antibodies as well as modest T cell responses. Importantly, all vaccinated NHPs were uniformly protected from disease. Emerging Microbes & Infections Vir Antibody Drug Aimed at Influenza A Fails in Clinical Trial The results are a setback in broader efforts to develop better protective measures against both seasonal and potential pandemic influenza strains. In the short term, Vir and outside experts hoped the drug could provide additional protection for at-risk groups like older adults, as flu vaccines are often only modestly effective. STAT, Vir BIOSECURITY + BIOPREPAREDNESS Bat Research Facility Coming to Fort Collins Has CSU Scientists Fighting Misinformation A one-of-a-kind bat research facility is coming to Colorado State University with the potential for groundbreaking discoveries as scientists study how bats respond to viruses — and what that could mean for treating sickness in humans. The NIH awarded CSU $6.7 million toward the 14,000-square-foot facility, slated for completion in 2025. But as scientists buzz about future pioneering bat research — including vaccine development, drug testing and how to guard against future pandemic threats — plans for the lab have generated controversy in a way that wouldn’t have been seen before the pandemic. Conservative pundits and politicos in Colorado have seized on the bat research facility, with some spreading misinformation and trying to draw parallels to the virology lab in Wuhan, China, at the center of the debate over COVID-19’s origins. Greeley Tribune PPE and Personal Protective Technology Product Standardization for a Resilient Public Health Supply Chain There is no single place, regulatory body, official guidance, or mandating authority in the United States for conformity assessment of all PPE or to find PPE requirements to meet all scenarios to which a public health department might need to respond.

NACCHO Hospital Incident Command System for Special Pathogen Preparedness Discussion on the importance of building foundations and solid structures for emergency management and provide information on available HICS resources and tools. NETEC Correcting Inaccuracies in the BMJ Article “Did COVID-19 come from a lab leak in China?” “EHA reported the results of the mouse experiment in question to the NIH in April 2018 in our Year 4 report. Furthermore, EHA conducted no further experiments on these viruses, which, it is important to note, were based on a bat CoV backbone (WIV-1) and dealt with a SARS-related bat CoV, not SARS-CoV (i.e., the work was with a bat CoV spike in a bat CoV backbone, neither of which had ever been shown to infect people). Analysis of published genomic data and other documents from the grantee demonstrate that the naturally occurring bat coronaviruses studied under the NIH grant are genetically far distant from SARS-CoV-2 and could not possibly have caused the COVID-19 pandemic.” EcoHealth Alliance Bat One Health: Science Solutions to Stop Spillover Collaboration brings expertise from multiple disciplines to understand pathogen emergence. Bat One Health studies the transmission of zoonotic pathogens—including transmission among reservoir hosts, transmission between host species (spillover), and transmission among humans —to learn the causes of emergence and find sustainable solutions that protect people and the environment. Bat One Health State Vet Lab Conducts First Animal Disease Investigation in New Necropsy Facility The Wyoming State Veterinary Laboratory’s BSL-3 necropsy facility was recently used to conduct a disease investigation for the first time. In addition to the large animal necropsy facility, the BSL-3 certified space includes three laboratory spaces used for research. Wyoming Tribune Eagle Judging How U.S. States Performed in the COVID-19 Pandemic Depends on the Metric With little political appetite to bolster federal public health authorities, states are likely to retain that central role in future U.S. public health emergencies. Accordingly, efforts to improve U.S. performance ahead of the next pandemic should start with examining why some states did so much better than others, even according to the various metrics governors set for themselves. Council on Foreign Relations The Impact of Chronic Underfunding on America’s Public Health System: Trends, Risks, and Recommendations This annual report tracks federal and state investment in public health and concludes that under-investment in public health programs leaves the nation less prepared for current and future health risks. One-time COVID-19 emergency funding helped control the pandemic but did not address structural weaknesses in the nation’s public health system. Trust for America’s Health Damages from Tornado at Pfizer Plant Could Compound Challenges of Drug Shortages Among the damaged buildings was a Pfizer plant in Rocky Mount, N.C., that produces nearly 30% of all sterile injectable medicines that the company sells to U.S. hospitals. “There are already 300 drugs that were in shortage before today. And many of those were sterile injectable drugs and like the ones manufactured at this facility. So, we are already in a state of crisis with drug shortages and this, obviously, has the potential to contribute to that.” STAT, Reuters SELECT AGENTS + PRIORITY PATHOGENS Rio Negro Virus Infection, Bolivia, 2021 Rio Negro virus (RNV), a Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) antigenic subtype VI virus, was first reported in 1987 after being isolated from mosquitoes collected in Chaco, Argentina. In May 2021, an agricultural worker originally from Trementinal, Argentina, sought treatment for febrile illness in Tarija, Bolivia, where he resided at the time of illness onset. The patient tested negative for hantavirus RNA, but next-generation sequencing of a serum sample yielded a complete genome for Rio Negro virus. Emerging Infectious Diseases Isolation and Genome Characterization of Lloviu Virus from Italian Schreibers’s Bats The most important achievement of this study is the isolation of an additional infectious LLOV isolate from a bat sample collected in Italy using the SuBK12-08 cells, demonstrating that this cell line is highly susceptible to LLOV infection19. This is consistent with a previous report which found these cells to be highly susceptible to Vesicular Stomatitis Virus pseudotyped with LLOV GP. Notably, there is still no evidence for actual spillover of LLOV from bats to humans, but the repeated isolation of infectious LLOV from Schreibers’s bats highlight the need for additional studies to better understand potential spillover mechanisms. Scientific Reports Available Evidence For Mosquito-Borne Francisella Tularensis Transmission is Inconclusive Very little is known about the potential of mosquitoes to transmit pathogenic bacteria. Nevertheless, especially among Swedish and Finnish experts the consensus is that mosquitoes are responsible for transmission of F. tularensis (the causal agent of tularemia) to humans. Evidence is limited and not all criteria of vector incrimination are shown to be met yet. Frontiers in Tropical Diseases Anti-Ricin Toxin Human Neutralizing Antibodies and DMAbs Protection Against Ricin Toxin Poisoning The ability to combine human mAbs with DNA-encoded monoclonal antibodies (DMAbs) to generate optimal in vivo kinetics and functionality against ricin toxin poisoning would represent a significant advance. Toxicology Letters The Genetic Diversity of Nipah Virus Across Spatial Scales We have a poor understanding of NiV diversity, including how many lineages circulate within a roost and the spread of NiV over increasing spatial scales. Here we develop phylogenetic approaches applied to the most comprehensive collection of genomes to date (N=257, 175 from bats, 73 from humans) from six countries over 22 years (1999-2020). In Bangladesh, where most human infections occur, we find evidence of increased spillover risk from one of the two co-circulating sublineages. MedRxiv AVIAN INFLUENZA Statement: Scientific Task Force on Avian Influenza and Wild Birds The last two years have seen unprecedented impacts of H5N1 high pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) on poultry and wild birds on a global scale. H5N1 has now in effect replaced the H5N8 subtype in Asia, Africa and Europe in both poultry and wild birds. The nature of the epizootic is particularly notable for the shift in seasonality of wild bird involvement, changes in epicentre of outbreaks and the changes in settings in which outbreaks have occurred. In addition to aggregations of wintering waterbirds being the typical focus of outbreaks, the virus has been increasingly maintained throughout northern summers since 2020. The virus has also spilled over and in some cases spread into relatively new avian hosts in novel settings, namely, seabirds in their breeding colonies. The nature of this ‘fitter’, better-adapted virus coupled with the density and gregarious behavioral nature of susceptible individuals in these situations has resulted in extremely high mortality seen in multiple locations particularly in the seabird breeding colonies of North-west Europe and beyond. FAO H5N1 Avian Flu Strikes More Finnish Fur Farms, Second Fox Species Increasing numbers of H5N1 detections in mammal species have raised concerns about whether the virus is changing to more easily infect humans. Finland is for the first time experiencing outbreaks of H5N1 infections in multiple fox species. The initial outbreaks at the fur farms were first reported last week, marking the country’s first such events in the facilities and the world’s second involving fox fur farms. CIDRAP Bird Flu: Two More Poultry Workers in England Test Positive Two new cases of bird flu have been detected in poultry workers after they came into contact with infected birds, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has said. It follows the confirmation of two positive cases in May, in different locations, under the same testing program. The UKHSA said it has not detected evidence of human-to-human transmission. Sky News, UKHSA Influenza A(H5N1) in Cats – Poland On 27 June 2023, the IHR National Focal Point of Poland notified WHO of unusual deaths in cats across the country. As of 11 July, 47 samples have been tested from 46 cats and one captive caracal, of which 29 were found to be positive for influenza A (H5N1). Fourteen cats are reported to have been euthanized, and a further 11 died from severe symptoms (difficulty breathing, GI and neurological symptoms), with the last death reported on 30 June. The source of the exposure WHOis currently unknown and epizootic investigations are ongoing. Sporadic infection of cats with A(H5N1) has previously been reported, but this is the first report of a high numbers of infected cats over a wide geographical area within a country. Thus far, no human contacts of A(H5N1) positive cats have reported symptoms, and the surveillance period for all contacts is now complete. World Health Organization CDC Raises Risk Slightly for Recent H5N1 Avian Flu Viruses The CDC this week published a new risk assessment for the H5N1 avian flu viruses that continues to circulate in wild birds and poultry, using a sample from a 2022 outbreak at a Spanish mink farm. Though the virus scored higher on some risk measures for potential emergence, the overall threat is moderate and similar to the earlier version of the virus. CIDRAP A Novel Triple Reassortment H3N8 Avian Influenza Virus: Characteristics, Pathogenicity, and Transmissibility An increasing number of new subtypes of avian influenza viruses (AIVs) are reported to be infecting humans, including H3N2, H5N1, H7N9, H10N8, and the recently emerged H3N8 virus in China in 2022. However, the genetic and biological properties of the currently prevalent H3N8 AIVs are not yet fully understood. This study reports the isolation of a novel triple reassortment H3N8 virus (GD-H3N8) from chicken flocks in Guangdong province, China, in 2022. In vivo, the GD-H3N8 isolate can replicate efficiently in mice without preadaptation, in addition to establishing systemic infection and transmission by direct contact in chickens. These findings underscore the need for continued surveillance of H3N8 viruses to identify circulating strains that may potentially threaten human health. Transboundary and Emerging Diseases CHEMICAL + RADIOLOGICAL THREATS Exposure to Organophosphorus Compounds: Best Practice in Managing Timely, Effective Emergency Responses An overview of the issues impacting on a timely critical response to the accidental or deliberate release of Organophosphorus Nerve Agents to improve first responder knowledge through a discussion of available evidence and best practices for rapid skin decontamination. A key aspect to achieving adequate preparedness is to ensure that generic medical countermeasures are forward-deployed and available, preferably within minutes of a contamination and that first responders know how to use them. European Journal of Emergency Medicine Open-Source Intelligence for Detection of Radiological Events and Syndromes Following the Invasion of Ukraine in 2022 On February 25, 2022, Russian forces took control of the Chernobyl power plant after continuous fighting within the Chernobyl exclusion zone. The disruption of war has caused interruptions to normal preventive activities, and radiation monitoring sensors have been nonfunctional. This paper aims to demonstrate the value of open-source intelligence in Ukraine to identify signals of potential radiological events of health significance during the Ukrainian conflict. JMIR Infodemiology Creating Realistic Nerve Agent Victim Profiles for Computer Simulation of Medical CBRN Disaster Response As CBRN scenarios are very difficult and expensive to recreate in real life, computer simulation is particularly suited for assessing the effectiveness of contingency plans and identifying areas of improvement. This paper we present a set of civilian nerve agent injury profiles consisting of clinical parameters and their evolution, as well as the methodology used to create them. These injury profiles are based on military injury profiles and adapted to the civilian population, using sarin for the purpose of illustration. Frontiers in Public Health Radiation-Induced Gene Expression Changes Used for Biodosimetry and Clinical Outcome Prediction Acute radiation syndrome (ARS), in particular after the deployment of a nuclear weapon or an attack on a nuclear power station, must be considered realistic particularly in light of the current war in Ukraine. Radiation-induced gene expression (GE) changes occur early after exposure and can be quickly quantified. GE can be used for biodosimetry purposes. Can GE be used to predict later developing ARS severity degrees and allocate individuals to the three clinically relevant groups as well? Cytogenetic and Genome Research Preventing and Reporting Chemical Releases During Extreme Weather Events The most important part of preventing releases of hazardous chemicals during a natural disaster is to be prepared and have a plan in place. The amount of time available to respond to extreme weather incidents may vary. Hurricanes are typically predictable and allow for adequate preparation, but flooding caused by severe rainfall may occur with much less warning. So having a plan of action for such events can save valuable time. EHS Daily Advisor PrC-210 Protects Against Radiation-Induced Hematopoietic and Intestinal Injury PrC-210 is a synthetic small molecule member of a new family of aminothiols designed to reduce toxicity while scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS). The results of this study demonstrated that PrC-210 has multiple protective effects to significantly suppress radiation-induced hematopoietic and intestinal injury when administered pre-radiation. Our data indicate that the protective effects of PrC-210 may have been achieved by accelerating hematopoietic regeneration, decreasing oxidative and nitrosative stress by enhancing the antioxidant defense regulated genes, protecting surviving jejunal crypts, and reducing circulatory inflammation markers. These findings indicate that PrC-210 is an effective prophylactic agent that should be developed using the FDA animal rule. Antioxidants SURVEILLANCE + DETECTION Use of Mpox Multiplex Serology in the Identification of Cases and Outbreak Investigations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) Evaluated whether antibody testing can be complementary to confirm cases and to identify human transmission chains during outbreak investigations. Pathogens Predicting Kyasanur Forest Disease Using Event-Based Surveillance and Transfer Learning In recent years, the reports of Kyasanur forest disease (KFD) breaking endemic barriers by spreading to new regions and crossing state boundaries is alarming. KFD is a tick-borne hemorrhagic fever caused by a virus belonging to the family Flaviviridae. Humans are the incidental hosts for the disease with an estimated yearly incidence of 400–500 cases; case fatality rates range between 2 and 10%9,18. However, larger outbreaks with more than 2500 annual cases have been reported in the past signifying its public health importance. Despite its zoonotic and public health importance, the disease has been historically understudied and the reasons for its emergence have been largely unknown. Scientific Reports Rapid On-Site Detection of SARS-CoV-2 Using RT-LAMP Assay with a Portable Low-Cost Device SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be successfully amplified within 15 min in a thermos, and the detection result is read rapidly in a portable low-cost device with high sensitivity. The portable low-cost device consists of a black box, a laser or LED and a filter, costing only a few cents. The rapid on-site detection method can provide strong support for the control of biological threats such as infectious diseases. It is also an emergency detection method for low-resource settings, relieving the huge pressure on health care. Biosensors High-Resolution Profiling of Bacterial and Fungal Communities High-throughput sequencing technologies have greatly advanced our understanding of microbiomes, but resolving microbial communities at species and strain levels remains challenging. This study presents a pipeline for designing, multiplexing, and sequencing highly polymorphic taxon-specific amplicons using PacBio circular consensus sequencing. BioRxiv (pre-print) Horses as Sentinels of Emerging Infectious Disease Horses with illness consistent with Hendra virus (HeV) are routinely sampled and submitted with case descriptions, to government laboratories for timely testing. Extensive investigations for further infectious agents are rare, yet <1% of around 1000 horses test HeV positive annually. Most that test negative feature infectious-like signs such as acute, severe neurological or respiratory illness and pyrexia, yet do not receive causative diagnosis HeV in horses and testing of suspect cases have highlighted challenges/ gaps in significant zoonotic disease investigation. Horses investigated for HeV-like disease present unique opportunities for improvements of broad profound biosecurity benefit. Horses are maintained in close association with other animals and humans, monitored thoroughly for disease and susceptible to agents transmitted by insects and wildlife such as bats. University of Sydney ENVIRONMENTAL FLUX El Niño Increases Global Health Threats That Require a One Health Response As the world enters an El Niño cycle made more extreme by climate change, effective responses must be grounded in a “One Health” approach that deals with the interconnections of humans, other animals, and plants and incorporates scientific understanding, technological advancements, and effective public policy. Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists As the Planet Warms, Scientists Worry That Cases of Infectious Diseases Could Spike Climate-driven impacts are taking a serious toll on human health. Cases of disease linked to mosquitos, ticks, and fleas tripled in the U.S. between 2004 and 2016. The threat extends beyond commonly recognized vector-borne diseases. Research shows more than half of all the pathogens known to cause disease in humans can be made worse by climate change. Seattle Times OUTBREAK NEWS Echovirus 11 Infections in Neonates Enteroviruses (EV) are a group of viruses that usually cause self-limited to mild illness. In certain populations, such as neonates, infection by specific serotypes of EV can cause severe illness. The most relevant EV subspecies in neonatal infections include Coxsackievirus B and Echovirus, including multiple distinct serotypes. Authorities in France informed EU/EEA Member States on 4 June 2023 of an increase in severe neonatal Echovirus 11 (E11) infection in neonates from July 2022 and in 2023. Several other Member States responded and together report 19 neonatal infections with severe E11 infection, of which nine cases have died. The UK also reported two fatal E11 neonatal cases during this period. The viruses isolated from cases in Italy belong to the same genetic cluster of those isolated in France in 2023 and are part of a new divergent lineage. ECDC Dengue in the Americas More outbreaks of dengue have been recorded so far in 2023 than all of last year in the WHO Region of the Americas, with close to three million suspected and confirmed cases. Brazil, Peru, Bolivia report the highest cases. 1302 deaths were reported in the Region with a Case Fatality Rate (CFR) of 0.04%, in the same period. WHO has assessed the risk of dengue as high at the regional level due to the wide spread distribution of the Aedes spp. mosquitoes (especially Aedes aegypti), the continued risk of severe disease and death, and the expansion out of historical areas of transmission, where all the population, including risk groups and healthcare workers, may not be aware of warning signs. WHO ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE CRISIS Senate Hearing Highlights Superbug Threats, Solutions At a hearing held by a subcommittee of the US Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor & Pensions, the experts spoke about the rising threat AMR poses to public health and modern medicine and the role that infection prevention, antibiotic stewardship, diagnostics, and a bolstered infectious disease workforce can play in addressing the problem. “The most important thing this subcommittee can do is to advance a policy to establish a pull incentive, such as a subscription model, to spur the discovery and development of novel antimicrobials.” CIDRAP Multidrug-Resistant Infections in War Victims in Ukraine Gram-negative, multidrug-resistant organisms—including those resistant to colistin, cefiderocol, and new β-lactam–β-lactamase inhibitor combinations—present considerable difficulties in the treatment of combat injury-related infections in patients in Ukraine and those repatriated elsewhere. The Lancet Infectious Diseases, Emerging Infectious Diseases COVID-19 PANDEMIC Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Free-Ranging White-Tailed Deer in the US This study demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 has been detected as enzootic in free-ranging white-tailed deer across nearly half of the states in the US. Sequenced viruses from Alpha, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron lineages were identified, although only Delta and Omicron predominantly circulated in the human population during this sampling period. The SARS-CoV-2 lineages were still present in white-tailed deer, months after the decline of those lineages in the human population. Nature Communications 2 Anti-Inflammatory Drugs Prevented COVID Deaths Two anti-inflammatory drugs didn’t shorten recovery time for patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19, but did reduce the likelihood of death, a new study shows. The researchers compared patients who received the drugs (infliximab, abatacept, and cenicriviroc), commonly prescribed to treat inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, with patients who received standard care alone. Futurity Estimating Long-Term Vaccine Effectiveness Against SARS-CoV-2 Variants These results suggest that the value of the ancestral vaccines, whilst providing initial high levels of protection, has gradually been diminished through both waning of protection following the 3rd and subsequent doses and the substantial immune escape presented by the Omicron variant. In combination, these two effects combine to generate a substantial additional estimated benefit of switching 4th and subsequent doses to variant-adapted vaccines—which we estimate to prevent nearly double the number of episodes of severe disease over a 1-year period compared to delivering the 4th dose with the ancestral vaccine. Nature Communications Bring Back Mandatory Mask Wearing in Health Settings, Say Scottish Workers The Scottish Healthcare Workers Coalition described policies to withdraw mandatory mask wearing this past May as flawed and dangerous and akin to playing “Russian roulette” with people’s lives. “Any decision that removes protection from the spread of SARS-CoV-2 puts those who are most vulnerable at greatest risk.” It adds that healthcare workers are three to four times more likely to contract covid than the general population and that the NHS is failing in its duty to provide a safe working environment. The BMJ Gene Linked to Long COVID Found in Analysis of Thousands of Patients The first genome-wide hunt to find genetic risk factors for long COVID has yielded a hit: a DNA sequence near a gene called FOXP4, which is active in the lungs and in some immune cells. Researchers hope that this analysis will be just the beginning: a vast amount of data are required to unpick a disorder as complex as long COVID. Previous research has linked the same gene to an increased risk of severe COVID-19, and Zeberg and his colleagues found that it is also associated with lung cancer. Nature Humoral Immune Responses Associated with Control of SARS-Cov-2 Breakthrough Infections in a Vaccinated US Military Population The Vaccine Effectiveness and Immune Response of SARS-CoV-2 Vaccines in Active Military Personnel (VIRAMP) study is an observational study that started enrolling active-duty military service members in May 2021. Clinical data and prospective longitudinal sampling of serum and saliva were used to characterize the humoral immune responses to vaccination and to assess protection from confirmed clinical and subclinical infections. Additionally, virologic outcomes of breakthrough infections including viral load and infection duration were captured. This study design allowed for comprehensive characterization of humoral immune responses prior to breakthrough infections. eBioMedicine What’s New with Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies? In the ongoing cat-and-mouse game between monoclonal antibody therapeutics and viral evolution, triumphs are sporadic and short-lived. After strong initial successes, almost all the available monoclonal antibody therapeutics now appear to have lost efficacy against the majority of circulating Omicron subvariants in the U.S., and their FDA EUAs have been revoked. No monoclonal antibody is currently approved in the U.S. for COVID-19 treatment, post-exposure prophylaxis or pre-exposure prophylaxis. Efforts are underway both to develop new antibody therapies targeting epitopes that may be less changeable with variant evolution (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05675943, NCT05648110) and to better understand the role of the non-neutralizing Fc effector function of existing monoclonal antibodies against evolving Omicron sublineages. IDSA HISTORICAL REFLECTIONS Epidemic Podcast: The Goddess of Smallpox What Shitala Mata, the goddess of smallpox, represents in Indian culture is complex. And defeating smallpox required appreciating and respecting that complexity. It also took medical advances, fresh ideas about epidemiology, unlikely partnerships, and the unwavering dedication of hundreds of thousands of health care workers.

Rohde, PhD, MS, SM (ASCP) CM, SVCM, MBCM, FACSc: One thing I often talk to patients about is that the vaccine and good public health measures are all about risk reduction. Mr Welch, as we think about that—and we’ve touched on this as well—how does the annual flu vaccination contribute to reducing the transmission of influenza and perhaps other respiratory agents within communities in the population?Adam C. Welch, PharmD, MBA, FAPhA: Individuals aged 65 and older account for 70% to 85% of all flu-related deaths. Flu and pneumonia combined are among the top 10 causes of death in this country. Individuals aged 65 and older also account for 50% to 70% of all flu-related hospitalizations. So the morbidity and mortality associated with flu, particularly in individuals aged 65 and older is significant. By vaccinating them and individuals around them, creating herd immunity in the small network they interact with routinely, that’s going to enhance the protection, particularly if somebody cannot receive the flu vaccine. Reducing that transmission via prevention through vaccines is important. But also, we have to understand the things COVID-19 has taught us. There are individuals who are much more aware of respiratory hygiene, coughing, and sneezing into a sleeve. Hand sanitizer is much more prevalent than it was a few years ago. These are prevention strategies, coupled with the influenza vaccine, can reduce the 85% of flu-related deaths overall that are coming from individuals aged 65 and older.Randy McDonough, PharmD, MS, BCGP, BCPS, FAPhA: It’s little things, like shaking hands. It’s a new thing, where maybe we don’t do that. I think about some of the social changes we’ve seen because of COVID-19.Adam C. Welch, PharmD, MBA, FAPhA: A study looked at how many times individuals touch their face. I asked some students this question. Do you think it’s 25 times a week or 25 times a day? It’s 25 times an hour. They’re always rubbing their face, touching their face. If you had touched a contaminated surface—you can’t see [influenza], you don’t know who was in the room an hour before you—and you touch your eyes, touch your nose, and touch your mouth, that’s a way to transmit the virus.Randy McDonough, PharmD, MS, BCGP, BCPS, FAPhA: I’m much more intentional doing 20-second hand washes.Rodney E. Rohde, PhD, MS, SM (ASCP) CM, SVCM, MBCM, FACSc: Coming back to talking about influenza, this all unfolds in the world of risk reduction in public health and what we’ve learned about air changes in a building or an airplane and how important that is. Plus, handshaking, hygiene, when you cough into your sleeve or into something else, masking—whatever the situation is. Even if you don’t understand that, you should start educating yourself about it. You can reduce your risk of aerosolized or airborne types of transmission.Chad Worz, PharmD, BCGP, FASCP: It’s niche, but in nursing homes, 1 thing that popped when all this went down was that we started to move away from sliding-scale insulin and getting finger sticks routinely. The effort was to reduce the contact between the nurse or staff and the patient in their room, to try to reduce transmission of infection. A lot of good came from that. We evolved to better ways of treating patients and reduced contact time. In the end, as you suggested with handshakes, it makes a difference. It’s been an interesting evolution.Transcript edited for clarity.Related VideosRelated Content Related Content Consent PreferencesAbout UsClinical ForumsAdvertiseContact UsEditorial StaffPrivacy PolicyTerms & ConditionsDo Not Sell My InformationContact Info2 Commerce Drive Cranbury, NJ 08512609-716-7777© 2024 MJH Life Sciences All rights reserved.High body temperature increases resistance to | EurekAlert! Advanced Search Home News Releases Multimedia Meetings Login Register News Release 20-Jul-2023 High body temperature increases resistance to pathogenic viral infections, new study finds Peer-Reviewed Publication The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo image: "Influenza Virus" by NIAID view more Credit: Minami Nagai, Miyu Moriyama, Chiharu Ishii, Hirotake Mori, Hikaru Watanabe, Taku Nakahara, Takuji Yamada, Dai Ishikawa, Takamasa Ishikawa, Akiyoshi Hirayama, Ikuo Kimura, Akihito Nagahara, Toshio Naito, Shinji Fukuda, Takeshi Ichinohe Researchers from The University of Tokyo unravel the connection between high body temperature and increased viral resistance. Clinical evidence suggests that elderly individuals are at a higher risk of contracting viral infections. Quite notably, the older people also have lower mean body temperatures. However, the effects of increased body temperature on fighting viral infections remain largely unexplored. A team of Japanese researchers has now been able to bridge the gap by linking higher body temperature with an increased infection-fighting capability of the gut microorganisms or "microbiota." Their study was published in Volume 14 Issue 3863 of Nature Communications in June 2023 and made available online on 30 June 2023. To conduct their experiments, the team used mice which were heat- or cold-exposed at 4°C, 22°C, or 36°C a week before influenza virus infection. After the viral infection was induced, the cold-exposed mice mostly died due to severe hypothermia, whereas the heat-exposed mice were highly resistant to the infection even at increasing doses of the virus. "High-heat-exposed mice raise their basal body temperature above 38°C, allowing them to produce more bile acids in a gut microbiota-dependent manner,” remarks Dr. Takeshi Ichinohe from the Division of Viral Infection, The University of Tokyo, Japan. The authors speculated that signaling of deoxycholic acid (DCA) from the gut microbiota and its plasma membrane-bound receptor "Takeda G-protein-coupled receptor 5" (TGR5) increased host resistance to influenza virus infection by suppressing virus replication and neutrophil-dependent tissue damage. While working on these experiments, the team noticed that mice infected with the influenza virus showed decreased body temperatures nearly four days after the onset of the infection, and they snuggled together to stay warm! The team noticed similar results after switching the influenza virus with SARS-CoV-2 and the study results were also validated using a Syrian hamster model. Their experiments revealed that body temperature over 38°C could increase host resistance to influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2 infections. Moreover, they also found that such increase in body temperature catalyzed key gut microbial reactions, which in turn, led to the production of secondary bile acids. These acids can modulate immune responses and safeguard the host against viral infections. Dr. Ichinohe explains, “The DCA and its nuclear farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonist protect Syrian hamsters from lethal SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, certain bile acids are reduced in the plasma of COVID-19 patients who develop moderate I/II disease compared with the minor severity of illness group.” The team then performed extensive analysis to gain insight into the precise mechanisms underlying the gut-metabolite-mediated host resistance to viral infections in heat-exposed rodents. Besides, they also established the role of secondary bile acids and bile acid receptors in mitigating viral infections. “Our finding that reduction of certain bile acids in the plasma of patients with moderate I/II COVID-19 may provide insight into the variability in clinical disease manifestation in humans and enable approaches for mitigating COVID-19 outcomes,” concludes Dr. Ichinohe. To briefly summarize, the published study reveals that the high-body-temperature-dependent activation of gut microbiota boosts the serum and intestinal levels of bile acids. This suppresses virus replication and inflammatory responses that follow influenza and SARS-CoV-2 infections. A heartfelt appreciation to the Japanese researchers for placing their trust in their intuition and gut instincts!

Poland recently reported "unusual deaths in cats" across the country, which were all likely caused by bird flu. (Image credit: Elena Popova via Getty Images) Dozens of cats in Poland recently died after contracting a highly pathogenic type of bird flu, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced Sunday (July 16).The bird flu virus — a subtype of avian influenza A called H5N1 — has sporadically infected cats in the past, but this marks the first report of "high numbers of infected cats over a wide geographical area within a country," the WHO noted. Classified as a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, H5N1 is known to cause severe disease and a high death rate in infected poultry. The virus can also infect various wild birds, some of which can spread the pathogen without falling ill themselves, and the bug sometimes leaps into mammals, including mink, seals, sea lions, cats and the rare human being.On June 27, authorities in Poland notified the WHO of "unusual deaths in cats across the country." By early July, clinical samples had been collected from 46 affected cats and one caracal (Caracal caracal), a wild cat native to Africa. Of the 47 samples, 29, or 62%, tested positive for H5N1. These positive samples came from 13 different geographical areas within Poland, the WHO reported.Related: H5N1 bird flu strain strikes 1st person in US An analysis of a subset of the viral samples showed that they were highly related to each other and that they were similar to H5N1 viruses that have been circulating in wild birds and sparking outbreaks in poultry in Poland."The source of exposure of cats to the virus is currently unknown," the WHO noted. It's possible that the cats had direct or indirect contact with infected birds or the birds' environments, or that they ate infected birds or food contaminated with H5N1. "Authorities are investigating all potential sources and to date have not ruled out any."Sign up for the Live Science daily newsletter nowGet the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.related stories—U.K.'s first human case of H5N1 avian flu detected in man with pet ducks—3 seals and a fox die from bird flu in rare outbreak at wildlife center—Ultra-rare, deep-diving whale dies on New England beach with possible case of bird flu Of the infected cats, 14 have been euthanized and 11 more have died. Post-mortem examinations of some of these cats suggested they'd developed pneumonia. Other severe symptoms exhibited by the infected cats included difficulty breathing, bloody diarrhea and "neurological signs."Since 2020, a dozen human cases of H5N1 have been reported to the WHO, but no new cases have been reported in connection with the outbreak among cats in Poland."As of 12 July, no human contacts of A(H5N1) positive cats have reported symptoms, and the surveillance period for all contacts is now complete," the WHO reported. The risk of H5N1 exposure from cats is considered low for Poland's general population and low to moderate for cat owners and for vets without the use of appropriate personal protective equipment.

(Supplied)abc.net.auews/flu-season-hitting-children-hard-antivirals-may-help/102633722Link copiedShareShare articleIt was just as the school holidays began that Emma Hampton's daughter started feeling unwell.By the next day she was unable to get eight-year-old Georgie out of bed, and for three days she ran a temperature of 39 degrees Celsius.Emma's other daughter also caught the flu, and in both girls the infection went to their lungs, leaving them coughing for two weeks.When their dad caught it, his infection was even worse, causing sharp body pains for more than a week.Emma said she had never seen her husband so unwell."It was no regular cold. It hit hard," she said.Their experience is being felt around the country as flu season takes hold.By early July there had been almost 150,000 cases of influenza notified to regulators in the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System, with 32,000 notifications in the most recent fortnight — suggesting cases are peaking.Flu vaccine rate plummetsPhoto shows A woman wearing a bright yellow face mask look down at a nurse putting a sticker bandaid on her arm after a vaccination.Flu vaccine uptake in recent months across Australia is almost 2 million down on what it was last year, with experts blaming COVID 'fatigue' and cost-of-living pressures. The numbers are on par with previous years but this year the flu is affecting young people and children the most.Federal health department data shows the highest numbers of flu cases nationally have been among those aged five to nine, under fours and tweens aged 10 to 14.There have been at least two deaths in that group, including an 11-year-old Queensland girl and a teenager from the New South Wales Central Coast.Despite dire warnings, vaccination rates have remained stubbornly flat, with only a third of the population vaccinated against the flu and the lowest rates among children aged five to 14.Simply too late to stop the spreadIt is at that point where health advocacy group the Immunisation Coalition says it is now "simply too late" to stop the worst of the spread.Its chair, Robert Booy, said it took at least two weeks for a flu vaccine to take effect, which meant even if people were vaccinated immediately they would not be immune until August.Professor Booy said vaccination was still the first line of defence, but it was now time to deploy the second line of defence; antivirals."It reduces the length of illness by at least a day, it reduces hospitalisation and reduces death," he said.The Immunisation Coalition receives funding from a range of sources including pharmaceutical companies that make antivirals, but maintains its advocacy is independent and evidence-based.Professor Booy, who is an infectious diseases paediatrician, is particularly concerned about vulnerable patients including children, the elderly, those with chronic illness, Indigenous people and migrant communities."It is critical for people who have just developed influenza to reach out urgently to their GP for antiviral treatment," he said.NSW Health figures show young people are making up the majority of presentations in emergency departments for flu and a disproportionate number of hospital admissions overall.What are the differences between COVID-19, RSV and the flu?Photo shows A woman lying in bed with medications next to herIs it COVID-19, RSV or the flu? Let's unpack their differences in symptoms.Phil Britton, an associate professor of paediatric infectious diseases at the University of Sydney, said children's hospitals were seeing more severe cases of influenza in kids than usual.Dr Britton said one reason this flu season was hitting kids hard was infection control measures during the pandemic had kept children quarantined."We're seeing a lot of children who are getting flu either for the first time or have not seen flu for a number of years," he said.Following the deaths of young people this year, Emma Hampton says she has changed how she thinks about flu.She says she will be sure to vaccinate her girls and will seek medical help."I would probably head to the doctor a little sooner just to be on the cautious side," Emma said.Emma Hampton says she will be more cautious after her husband and children caught the flu.What antivirals are out there?In Australia three antivirals are approved for use for influenza and two are available at pharmacies.The main one is called Tamiflu, also known as oseltamivir.There's also Relenza, chemical name zanamivir, which is inhaled.A third, called peramivir, is an intravenous infusion used in hospitals.Most GPs typically opt for Tamiflu because it has been shown to shorten flu duration by about a day.There is some evidence it can keep some patients from developing complications like respiratory infections that put them in hospital.Relenza is an inhaled medication and can also be used as a prophylactic, or preventative, medicine when there are outbreaks.It has been shown to shorten illness as well but there is no evidence it keeps people out of hospital.Both medications will likely reduce viral load and could help prevent spread in the community.A little-known rule that shouldn't make it hard to get an urgent GP appointmentPhoto shows Lea Russ lying in a hospital bed, with multiple IV tubes hooked up to one arm.Patients are increasingly waiting more than 24 hours to be seen. But general practices are meant to offer emergency bookings.The key challenge with both is that neither is subsidised on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme so patients are looking at between $40 and $50 at the pharmacy counter, whereas if it was listed it would be $7.30 for concession patients or $30 for everyone else.Second, both need to be taken within 48 hours of the first symptoms of flu, which means getting an urgent appointment and a script from a GP in a short space of time.That's a tricky proposition when there are GP shortages.The side effects include nausea and vomiting.But Professor Booy said antivirals were available to those who requested them and were approved for use from two weeks of age."You don't need a positive flu test so at the moment you can go straight from flu symptoms," he said."They can do it as a telehealth thing. They can do an e-script."But do they work? And how?Allen Cheng, the director of infectious diseases at Monash Health, said there was evidence that older people benefited more than others from the use of antivirals.Tamiflu works by blocking a specific enzyme in the body which is responsible for helping the flu virus replicate and spread through the body.He said there was conflicting evidence about whether it kept people out of hospital, but it was probably beneficial for vulnerable populations."It probably does reduce lower respiratory tract infections," he said.But, he said, it was less clear about whether they stopped patients getting serious complications such as pneumonia."You can see reduced viral load — you will stop transmitting it. But a lot of those are still a bit unproven," Professor Cheng said.Antiviral use controversial in childrenThe use of antivirals to treat children with influenza is controversial, according to Phil Britton.He said his unit at The Children's Hospital at Westmead was advocating for their use at a higher rate among children in intensive care, but cautioned against too much reliance on them."I don't think they're a game changer," he said."There's very little evidence for their use in children out of hospital," he said.Professor Cheng agreed, and said they should only be used on a case-by-case basis."It's not so clear in children," he said."It probably works. There haven't been big trials."They both said the best prevention for children was a flu vaccine."There's still time to get a vaccine," Dr Britton said.Posted Sat 22 Jul 2023 at 6:53pmSaturday 22 Jul 2023 at 6:53pmSat 22 Jul 2023 at 6:53pm, updated Mon 24 Jul 2023 at 12:35amMonday 24 Jul 2023 at 12:35amMon 24 Jul 2023 at 12:35amShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Top StoriesFamily of teacher's aide killed in preschool crash pay tribute to 'cherished mother, wife, daughter'Topic:Road Accidents and IncidentsPhoto shows Eleanor Bryant, who was killed when a truck crashed into a Victorian preschool, pictured smiling at the races.Barron Trump and AOC expose the problems with the Democratic campaignTopic:US ElectionsPhoto shows Barron Trump and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in a split screen image.

The disease reached South America in November 2022, and has now been reported on every continent except Oceania and Antarctica.Working out how many wild birds have died is difficult because so many carcasses are never found or counted. Michelle Wille, from the University of Sydney, co-authored research that is believed to be the first attempt to assess numbers on a global scale. It documents deaths since October 2021. “We estimate the scale of mortality among wild birds is in the millions rather than tens of thousands reported,” the paper says.“The outbreaks among wild birds are causing population and species level concerns which may drive extinctions and jeopardise decades of conservation efforts,” it adds.More than 40% of all Peruvian pelicans dying over a period of a few weeks in early 2023. More than 100,000 boobies have died and 85,000 cormorants, according to Peruvian government data. Wille said: “South America has been incredibly hard hit and the numbers are staggering … Outbreaks are having very real species and population-level effects, such that there is concern that some populations may never recover. The situation is extremely distressing.View image in fullscreenWorkers spray pelicans with disinfectant after burial in Lima in December.

Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images“We are extremely concerned for what will happen in spring [in the southern hemisphere] as the virus has now been detected in Tierra del Fuego, which implies an increased risk for the virus to emerge in Antarctica.”Peru has been very active in recording deaths from bird flu, but other countries have been less open about what is happening, said Ian Brown, director of scientific services at the UK’s Animal and Plant Health Agency (Apha). For example, Brazil – the world’s biggest chicken meat exporter – was one of the last countries to confirm it had cases in wild birds, six months after reports from Peru. There is also an issue with countries not having enough resources to report on the impact of the virus, Brown said. “I would be cautious about saying Peru is a particular hotspot … it’s probably not alone.”View image in fullscreenBlack-necked swans found dead in Taim ecological reserve, Rio Grande do Sul state, Brazil, in May, are collected for analysis. Photograph: Esec Taim/ReutersHe added: “What’s happened is that this virus has found its way into South America for the very first time. In Europe, and to some extent North America, we’ve had cases like this in the last few years … so they will build up some immunity. But birds in South America have not seen this virus before.” This may explain why mortality rates are so high.Elsewhere, significant population impacts around the world include 17% of sandwich terns dying in Europe in 2022; 40% of south-east European Dalmatian pelicans dying in 2021, and 62% of Caspian terns breeding on Lake Michigan dying in 2022.Data shows the disease has also been detected in Indonesia, with concerns its next stop could be Australia. “That’s the first time in the history of this virus, or group of viruses, that we’ve seen that global spread on such a scale. It’s a gamechanger,” said Brown.Europe is now on its second breeding season with H5N1. The virus hasn’t changed, but it has affected different birds in Europe this year compared with last year.Black-headed gulls across the continent and in the UK have been hit badly, as well as terns. Nationally, 10% of black-headed gulls have died since the end of March, which means at least 30,000 dead individuals, not including the many thousands of dead chicks, according to James Pearce-Higgins, director of science at the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO). “There have been tragic tales of people seeing dead black-headed gulls with chicks trying to nestle up to them.”View image in fullscreenA dead black-headed gull at RSPB Belfast’s Window on Wildlife reserve last month. Photograph: Liam McBurney/PAThe two species, terns and black-headed gulls, nest in similar places and close together, making for easy disease transmission between them. “The picture I’ve given you is a microcosm of what is happening across Europe,” said Pearce-Higgins.Other birds have been less badly affected. Northern gannets and great skuas – which were severely hit in 2022 – appear to have had very few deaths this year. Early research suggests some have immunity but others simply may not have been exposed.Researchers still don’t know what proportion of individuals are able to recover from bird flu, how long that immunity lasts and how much protection it gives. In gannets, it appears darker eyes indicate the bird might have some immunity.‘The equivalent to our Covid pandemic’: bird flu hasn’t gone away and is still spreading Read moreAlthough UK seabird breeding colonies have not been as badly hit as last year, a number of outbreaks have occurred in recent weeks. Earlier this month rangers described their “heartbreak” at discovering more than 600 dead chicks at Britain’s largest mainland Arctic tern colony in Long Nanny on the Northumberland coast. There has also been an increase in cases in north Wales, with reports of dead terns, herring gulls and puffins. Hundreds of birds have washed up on the east coast of Scotland.Last year, there were widespread impacts on a number of species, with data collected by the Guardian showing H5N1 had killed at least 50,000 wild birds – double previous estimates. The effects of last year’s outbreak are now being felt on the number of birds returning this year.View image in fullscreenMore than 11,000 gannets were killed by bird flu last summer in Scotland but this year the world’s largest colony of northern gannets – the Bass Rock in the Firth of Forth – is showing signs of recovery. Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianEarly signs from Scotland suggest great skuas in Shetland have been hit particularly hard, according to Nature Scot. At one reserve, Hermaness in Shetland, 90% may have been lost, suggesting “significant breeding population declines” compared with last year, the agency said. Scotland has 60% of the world’s population of great skuas.Looking at UN surveillance data it appears Europe still has more cases than anywhere else but that will be down to reporting. Brown said: “Gaps on the map do not mean the virus is not there. Look at central Asia [where] there are big holes, in parts of Africa there are big holes, and that is simply because there isn’t surveillance being done.“It would be premature to say this current strain of H5N1 is going to die out any time soon … We are facing an international crisis.”Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and featuresExplore more on these topicsBird fluThe age of extinctionBirdsEndangered speciesWildlifeHealthPeruAmericasnewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedEnvironmentClimate crisisWildlifeEnergyPollutionNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveTax strategyFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInXNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

COVID-19 surveillance up until end of week 28 COVID-19 case rates have slightly increased this week compared to our previous report: 3.7% of 4,403 respiratory specimens reported through the Respiratory DataMart System were identified as COVID-19, compared to 3.6% of 4,535 from the previous report. The overall COVID-19 hospital admission rate for week 28 was 1.17 per 100,000 population, an increase from 0.8 per 100,000 in the previous report. ICU admission rates have increased to 0.07 compared to 0.04 in the previous report. Those aged 85 and over continue to have the highest hospital admission rates. These have increased to 9.8 per 100,000 from 8.61 per 100,000 in the previous report. Admission rates among those aged 75 to 84 have increased to 5.54 per 100,000 from 4.74 in the previous report. Dr Jamie Lopez Bernal, Consultant Epidemiologist for Immunisation at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said: COVID-19 cases and hospital admission rates remain at low levels, though have risen very slightly in the past 2 weeks. We will continue to monitor these rates closely. The NHS will be in contact in autumn 2023 when the seasonal vaccine is available for those who are eligible due to health conditions or age. Remember that the virus can cause serious illness, especially for those who are older or immunosuppressed, so we urge everyone who is offered to take up the vaccine when offered." Previous Thursday 6 July 2023 This fortnightly flu and COVID-19 report brings together the latest surveillance data along with the latest public health advice. COVID-19 surveillance up until end of week 26 COVID-19 case rates have decreased this week compared to our previous report. 3.6% of 4,535 respiratory specimens reported through the Respiratory DataMart System were identified as COVID-19. Hospital admissions and ICU admission rates have continued to decrease. The overall COVID-19 hospital admission rate for week 26 was 0.8 per 100,000 population, a decrease from 2.03 per 100,000 the previous report. Those aged 85 years and over continue to have the highest hospital admission rates, though these have continued to decline this week to 8.61 per 100,000 from 22.4 per 100,000 in the previous report. Admission rates among those aged 75 to 84 years have declined to 4.74 per 100,000 from 10.06 in the previous report. ICU admission rates continue to decrease to 0.04 compared to 0.07 in our previous report. Dr Mary Ramsay, Head of Immunisation at UKHSA, said: COVID-19 rates remain low, but those who are older or immunosuppressed are still at risk of being admitted to hospital. As we enter July, the spring booster offer has now closed. The seasonal COVID-19 vaccine will return in autumn 2023. If your NHS record suggests you may be eligible due to your health condition or age, the NHS will be in contact with you to let you know when you can take up this offer. Those who have developed a new health condition or started treatment that severely weakens your immune system, as well as children aged 6 months to 4 years who are at increased risk of getting seriously ill from COVID-19 may still be eligible for a COVID-19 vaccine. We'd recommend speaking with your specialist for more information."

By Korin Miller Korin Miller Korin Miller is a freelance writer specializing in general wellness, sexual health and relationships, shopping, and lifestyle trends, with work appearing in Women’s Health, Self, Prevention, Forbes, Daily Beast, and more. health's editorial guidelines Updated on July 19, 2023 Medically reviewed by Jane Kim, MD Medically reviewed by Jane Kim, MD Jane Kim, MD, is currently a medical editor and writer. She also consults on digital content for physician medical education. learn more Close The next pandemic is not far-fetched, partly because it's happened multiple times before. Our highly interconnected world is largely to blame for the worst pandemics in history. "Viruses used to spread at the speed of a steamboat. Now, they can spread at the speed of a jet. In that sense, we're more at risk," Amesh Adalja, MD, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told Health. There are more densely populated cities now than ever before, said Dr. Adalja. That creates an environment ripe for the rapid spread of diseases. Some of the worst pandemics in history include the 2009 swine flu pandemic and three other flu pandemics during the 20th century. Other examples are the global HIV/AIDS epidemic starting in the 1980s and the Black Death during the 14th century. In late December 2019, the world was introduced to a novel coronavirus—SARS-CoV-2—the virus that causes COVID-19. Two months later, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic. By July 2023, COVID-19 was responsible for over 767 million cases worldwide. Here's a look at some of the worst pandemics, both flu-related and not, though excluding the current coronavirus pandemic, in modern history. Alex Sandoval 2009 Swine Flu Pandemic In 2019, the H1N1 flu virus, known as "swine flu," spread quickly worldwide. Researchers had not previously identified the novel H1N1 flu virus in either animals or humans. Between April 12, 2009, and April 10, 2010, swine flu caused 60.8 million cases, 274,304 hospitalizations, and about 12,469 deaths in the United States. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that up to 575,400 people died worldwide. Swine flu primarily affected children and middle-aged adults. Some evidence suggests that older adults had immunity, likely from previous exposure to a similar flu virus. The pandemic officially ended on August 10, 2010. Still, the H1N1 flu virus circulates seasonally. Global Epidemic of HIV/AIDS Researchers first detected human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the early 1980s. HIV, which spreads through blood, anal or vaginal sex, and breast milk, attacks the immune system. HIV progresses to AIDS if the immune system severely weakens. During the late 1800s, HIV "jumped" from chimpanzees in Central Africa to humans. The virus likely spread to humans who hunted chimpanzees and came into contact with their blood. In 1981, HIV largely affected the LGBTQ+ community in the United States, which led to discrimination and prejudice. Still, HIV can affect anyone who comes into contact with infected anal and vaginal fluids, blood, breast milk, or semen. The WHO reports that more than 84 million people have been infected with HIV since the beginning of the epidemic, and about 40 million people have died of AIDS. Globally, 38.4 million people were living with HIV in 2021. Treatments have allowed more people to live with HIV and help keep the virus from progressing to AIDS. 1968 Flu Pandemic The H3N2 flu A virus caused the 1968 flu pandemic, or the Hong Kong flu, which originated in China. The 1957–1958 flu pandemic may have given rise to the 1968 outbreak through an antigenic shift. Antigenic shift happens when two flu viruses combine to form a novel flu virus, like H3N2. Many people do not have any immunity to those novel viruses, which is why they can spread rapidly. The H3N2 flu virus was responsible for about one million people worldwide, including 100,000 people in the United States. Antigenic shifts do not happen often. Instead, changes to flu viruses, such as antigenic drift, are why people can get the flu more than once. Antigenic drift occurs as the flu virus slowly evolves so that it can continue to infect people. Getting an annual flu vaccine helps protect against the flu and its ever-changing nature. COVID-19 Is the Worst Pandemic in US History 1957–1958 Flu Pandemic Another flu pandemic, the "Asian flu" pandemic, began in East Asia in 1957. The culprit was the H2N2 flu virus, first detected in Singapore in February 1957. The virus made its way to Hong Kong in April 1957 and coastal cities in the United States during the summer of 1957. The H2N2 flu virus caused an estimated 1.1 million deaths worldwide, with 116,000 in the United States. 1918 Flu Pandemic An H1N1 flu virus caused the 1918 flu, or the "Spanish flu," pandemic. Research has found that the origin may have been avian (bird), though it's unclear exactly where the virus originated. The CDC estimates that the H1N1 flu virus infected 500 million people, or one-third of the world's population at that time. The H1N1 flu virus ultimately caused at least 50 million deaths worldwide, with about 675,000 in the United States. Much remains undocumented about the H1N1 flu virus. One widely-reported effect was rapid and severe lung damage, including: Fluid-filled lungs Inflammation of lung tissue Severe pneumonia In 2005, scientists replicated the 1918 H1N1 flu virus to evaluate its ability to cause disease and harm a host. That information helps health officials prepare for future pandemics. The Black Death The bubonic plague caused pandemic levels of illness during the 14th century with the Black Death, which started the second plague pandemic. An outbreak of the bubonic plague occurred in London in 1665, killing nearly 25% of London's population. The death toll was so high that people constructed mass graves. The outbreak eventually tapered off one year later. The bubonic plague exists in rural areas in the Western United States but is more common in parts of Africa and Asia. Humans typically contract the bubonic plague through the bite of infected fleas. Symptoms of the bubonic plague include: Boboes, or painful, swollen lymph nodesChillsFeverHeadacheWeakness Seek medical attention right away if you have those symptoms and suspect the bubonic plague. Antibiotics help successfully treat the infection. COVID-19 vs. Black Plague: What Do These Infectious Diseases Have in Common? A Quick Review Pandemics occur when an illness spreads rapidly across the world. Several pandemics preceding the COVID-19 pandemic have occurred throughout history, including three flu pandemics during the 20th century. Studying past pandemics helps prepare health officials for possible future ones. Pandemic preparedness may include diagnosing, preventing, and treating infectious diseases. Was this page helpful?

Download PDF Download PDF Vaccines have a tremendous impact on public health, and their importance has been emphasized by the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we provide an overview of the current state of research and development (R&D) on prophylactic vaccine candidates for infectious diseases globally.Technology platformsAs of 1 January 2023, the global vaccine R&D landscape includes 966 candidates, among which 23% (220) are traditional inactivated or attenuated vaccines (Fig. 1a,b). Advances in molecular technologies have led to the development of other platforms, such as recombinant protein vaccines, nucleic acid vaccines and viral vector vaccines, which have further diversified the pipeline.Fig. 1 | Landscape of vaccine candidates by technology platform, R&D phase and disease. a, The 966 vaccine candidates were classified into the categories shown based on the underlying technology platforms. Products with inadequate information for classification were included in an ‘Unknown’ group, and those not fitting into the main groups were included in an ‘Others’ group. b, All candidates excluding ‘Unknown’ and ‘Others’ are shown in the bar chart, classified by R&D phase. c, Proportion of vaccine candidates against different diseases. Diseases with less than ten candidates were included in the ‘Others’ group. d, Candidates for the top six diseases for vaccine development, by technology platform. HPV, human papilloma virus; IND, investigational new drug application; RSV, respiratory syncytial virus. See Supplementary information for details.Recombinant protein vaccines account for the largest proportion of the pipeline at 22% (215 candidates; Fig. 1a,b), supported by their well-understood safety profile, stability and ease of manufacturing. Almost 100 recombinant vaccine candidates are in phase I development, the highest number at this stage among all the platforms.The successful launch of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines has built momentum for nucleic acid vaccine platforms, which include RNA and DNA vaccines. Such platforms now make up the second largest segment of the overall pipeline, at 18% (173 candidates; Fig. 1a,b). Owing to the flexibility of these platforms in developing vaccine candidates for pathogens with high variability in the target antigens, many of these candidates are being developed for such pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2 (95 candidates), influenza (24 candidates) and HIV (21 candidates).Viral vector vaccines (133 candidates; 14%; Fig. 1a,b) have also garnered attention in recent years, owing to their potential to induce robust and durable immune responses. Various types of viral vectors are being used, including adenoviruses, retroviruses, lentiviruses and poxviruses. In particular, adenoviral vectors (82 candidates) have been widely applied in the development of vaccines for diseases including Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS-CoV-2. To circumvent the limitation of pre-existing immunity to adenovirus type 5 (Ad5), versatile adenoviral serotypes have been developed, such as Ad26, Ad35 and Ad11.Conjugate vaccines, which are the next largest group (109 candidates; 11%; Fig. 1a,b), have often been developed against pathogens such as meningococcus, pneumococcus and haemophilus influenzae. These vaccines are based on covalent linkage of immunogenic protein carriers (mostly tetanus toxoid, diphtheria toxoid or group B meningococcal outer membrane protein) to capsular polysaccharides or peptides to enhance immunogenicity and stability.DiseasesThe top three diseases for vaccine development are all caused by viruses: SARS-CoV-2 (246 candidates; 25%), influenza (104 candidates; 11%) and HIV (84; 9%) (Fig. 1c,d; Supplementary Fig. 1).SARS-CoV-2. In addition to over 50 vaccines that have received market approval or emergency use authorization (not included in this analysis), another 64 candidates had entered phase III or had a regulatory application submitted, of which 47% were mRNA vaccines. In the current pipeline, at least 14 nasal vaccines are in development, which are expected to stimulate immunity in the respiratory mucosa and reduce transmission.HIV infection. The high variability of the viral genome and the high level of glycosylation of the HIV envelope glycoprotein (gp), which often induces immune evasion, have hindered the development of successful HIV vaccines. However, there is hope of stimulating the production of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) by targeting conserved regions of envelope proteins with little variation between HIV strains, such as gp160, gp41 and gp120. Novel platforms such as viral vectors and mRNA offer a promising avenue for HIV vaccine development. For example, two mRNA vaccines to induce the production of bnAbs are now in a phase I trial (NCT05001373).Influenza. In contrast to the dominance of novel technologies in HIV vaccine development, 40% of influenza vaccine candidates were inactivated vaccines (Fig. 1d). Given the variety of influenza subtypes from antigenic drift, universal vaccines are being increasingly developed to reduce the need for frequent vaccination. The vaccines were designed based on highly conserved epitopes in the viral haemagglutinin, neuraminidase or other proteins. At the time of analysis, six universal influenza vaccine candidates were in phase III trials.Other diseases. Beyond the three diseases above, there are a substantial number of vaccines being developed for respiratory syncytial virus (31 candidates; 3%), supported by recent breakthroughs in targeting stable pre-F proteins. Notably, two recombinant protein vaccines, PF-06928316 and GSK3844766A, resulted in >80% protection in phase III trials, and received FDA approval in 2023, after the cut-off date for the analysis. An mRNA vaccine (mRNA-1345) has received breakthrough therapy designation from the FDA after also showing >80% protection in a phase III trial.Non-viral pathogens such as malaria (57 candidates; 6%) and pneumococci (40 candidates; 4%) also represent a significant area of interest (Fig. 1c,d). Conjugate vaccines are the primary focus for pneumococcal bacteria, while recombinant proteins and viral vectors are the main platforms for malaria vaccines. Vaccines are also being developed to prepare for potential future outbreaks of diseases such as Ebola.R&D distributionVaccine R&D is mainly concentrated in the USA (355 candidates), China (271 candidates) and western Europe (144 candidates) (Fig. 2a), in part due to their strong R&D capabilities and regulatory policy support. Some differences in technology platform preferences have been observed in these regions; the US pipeline features more nucleic acid vaccines, whereas the pipeline in China has more inactivated vaccines and fewer viral vector vaccines than the USA and western Europe. The majority (68%) of the candidates are being developed independently or collaboratively by private companies/industry, while 25% are being developed by academic or other non-profit organizations (Fig. 2b). Notably, candidates against HIV and malaria are being developed mostly by academic or other non-profit organizations.Fig. 2 | Distribution of vaccine candidates by geographic location and type of developer. a, Vaccine candidates with developers from the USA, China and western Europe, categorized by technical platform. b, Candidates for the top six diseases for vaccine development, by type of developer. See Supplementary information for details.OutlookThe success of vaccine development relies heavily on the identification of effective antigens and the use of appropriate technology platforms. In addition, international collaboration and coordinated efforts are crucial to efficiently achieve these goals. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of global cooperation in addressing public health emergencies, and has demonstrated the potential benefits of sharing resources and expertise to accelerate vaccine development and deployment. This includes sharing scientific resources and expertise, collaborating on R&D, and establishing coordinated mechanisms for outbreak preparedness and response.

The pigs began displaying symptoms on July 14 at the fair which took place July 7-16 at Springfield Oaks County Park in Davisburg and is organized and managed by the Oakland County 4-H Fair Association. The swine barn closed to the public that evening. No human cases of swine flu have been reported in Michigan this year. The Health Division is working with state partners and fair management to contact trace and monitor exhibitors and fair staff who were exposed. In the meantime, out of an abundance of caution, the county is notifying the public who may have visited the swine barn. “Fairgoers who visited the swine barn and develop respiratory symptoms are encouraged to talk to a health care provider and report potential exposure to infected swine,” said Dr. Russell Faust, Oakland County medical director. “Physicians are reminded to consider swine influenza in persons presenting with symptoms, even during the warmer months when seasonal influenza cases are low.” Swine influenza (flu) is a respiratory disease in pigs caused by type A influenza viruses. Swine flu viruses don’t usually infect humans, but human infections have been reported. People cannot get swine influenza from eating properly prepared pork or handling pork products – only from contact with an ill pig. Symptoms of swine flu in people are like seasonal flu and may include fever, cough, runny nose, and sometimes body aches, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. Symptoms usually appear within three days of exposure but can occur for up to 10 days. On rare occasions, swine flu in humans can lead to severe illness such as pneumonia or death. Those at higher risk of developing complications if they get swine influenza include children younger than 5 years, people 65 years and older, pregnant women, and people with certain chronic health issues, such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease, weakened immune systems and neurological conditions. There is no vaccine for swine flu, and the seasonal flu vaccine will not protect against it. Antiviral drugs such as Tamiflu and Relenza, however, are effective in treating swine flu. Early treatment works best and may be especially important for people with a high-risk condition. Additional subtyping, including whole genome sequencing, will be performed by the National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa. The expected turnaround time is approximately three weeks.

Since the flu season started in the southern hemisphere in late April, children have made up almost 75 per cent of those admitted to hospital, according to Australian health data.“There’s a red flag waving at us right now, saying to be on the alert and to get protected,” said Dr. John Yaremko, a Montreal-based pediatrician.So far, Australia’s flu season is not as bad as it was last year in terms of the number of cases, but what concerns Yaremko is the age group that is most affected.Although the flu season typically tends to impact the most vulnerable people, such as infants, seniors, those who are immune-compromised or pregnant people, Yaremko said a “high proportion” of children being hospitalized are in the five to 10 age group. Story continues below advertisement 2:25 Interior Health sends letter to parents outlining when to seek medical attention amid bad flu season Australian health data shows that since the flu season began, children aged five to nine have been the most impacted by the flu, followed by those under the age of five.“There’s no question that the pediatric population has been affected,” Yaremko said. “And usually, influenza tends to be worse for kids under five, especially kids under two. And what they’ve seen this year is that the five- to 10-year-olds get quite sick and then are hospitalized.”He said this is unusual as kids between five and 10 tend to “be healthy” and not have any underlying health conditions. Young children, particularly those under five, are the group most likely to be hospitalized with flu, he added.“And the reason for this, we don’t know, it’s not clear,” he said. “And that’s what we should be worried about in Canada.” Story continues below advertisement Low vaccination rates, flu strain The reasons behind the increased hospitalization of children in this age group compared with others are not yet fully understood, but there are theories among experts. And one is related to the low flu vaccination rate in Australia. Get weekly health news Receive the latest medical news and health information delivered to you every Sunday.

According to the country’s national immunization data system, in 2020 42 per cent of children aged from six months to under five years were vaccinated at this time, compared with 24 per cent now.And for children aged five to 15, just over a quarter (26 per cent) were vaccinated at this time in 2020, compared with 14.3 per cent now.“It seems that the vaccination rate in children has dropped considerably this year compared to previous years, and that’s probably the bigger factor that’s leading to hospitalizations rather than a particularly virulent strain or a more transmissible strain,” explained Barry Power, editor-in-chief of the Canadian Pharmacists Association. Story continues below advertisement Since COVID-19, he said many people have “vaccine fatigue,” which may explain the low immunization rates, however, he stressed the importance of getting the yearly flu shot.In Canada, the rate of flu shots increased from 39 per cent in 2021-22 to 43 per cent in 2022-23 and is now back to the pre-pandemic level, according to data from Health Canada.However, the numbers provided only presented data for individuals aged 18 and above, and not for children. 4:51 Health Matters: Vaccine booster fatigue ahead of cold and flu season “The vaccine doesn’t always prevent someone from getting the flu, but it can prevent them from getting really sick. And the bigger thing that it can do is prevent people from transmitting the flu,” Power said.Another possible explanation for the disproportionate impact of the flu season on children compared with adults is the specific strain that is currently circulating, explained Gerald Evans, an infectious disease expert at Queen’s University. Story continues below advertisement Since the flu season kicked off in Australia, the country has reported that influenza A made up for 65 per cent of cases and influenza B accounted for 32 per cent of cases.“What’s interesting about this year is they’re seeing a lot more influenza B,” Evans said. “They’re still seeing mostly influenza A, but the number of influenza B is much higher than it was last year. Last year was almost a completely dominant influenza A.”And influenza B tends to cause more severe illness in children, he added. What this means for Canada Trending Now From 300 lbs to 100K races: How this mom of 4 took up ultramarathons One person is dead and 16 are injured after a shooting at Tuskegee University Australia’s flu season, which typically runs from June to October, has long been looked at by Canadian health experts in preparation for flu season here, which usually begins anywhere between late October and early January.In an email to Global News, a spokesperson from the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) said officials are monitoring Australia’s flu season for situational awareness. Story continues below advertisement “Influenza activity in Australia appears to have stabilized after an increasing trend, with nearly all indicators now within historical averages for this time of year,” the spokesperson said, adding that reports showing that children in Australia have been disproportionately affected this flu season likely reflect a lack of natural immunity in this population. 2:09 Experts warn of nasty flu season ahead Because Australia’s flu season seems to disproportionately be impacting children, Yaremko recommends getting your child vaccinated against the flu when the shot is made available in Canada.“If you look at what is happening in Australia, it could easily happen here,” he said.“I’ll be much more proactive in this age group than I have been in the past and continuing to encourage the high-risk and continue to encourage everybody because it’s such an easy thing to do and it’s a safe thing to do.” Story continues below advertisement Is Canada ready? Last flu season, Canada had a scarcity of pediatric acetaminophen and ibuprofen due to the resurgence of respiratory illnesses like the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), as the pandemic eased and kids started going back to school.But Power believes the flu season in 2022 and early 2023 was an “unusual situation.” The combination of respiratory viruses with manufacturing delays created a shortage of pain medications.“Health Canada has worked very closely with the manufacturers of the child and infant products for pain and fever to increase the supply and also to put some measures in place that will help to prevent this from happening again,” he said.So far, he said pharmacies across Canada have not reported a shortage of medications, as supply has “significantly” increased.“Some of that is outside the consumer’s hands, but the consumers can do a couple of things. They can get vaccinated. They can get their children vaccinated and then practise all of the respiratory hygiene measures that we learned and used so effectively over the pandemic,” Powers said.

FluMist Quadrivalent is a live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) comprised of four influenza strains. It will be available for use in Japan in children 2-18 years of age for the 2023/2024 flu season.Yet four months on, awareness of FluMist Quadrivalent among healthcare providers remains limited and uptake of the vaccine may not be met with great success, says data and analytics company GlobalData.In Japan, FluMist Quadrivalent will be marketed by Daiichi Sankyo, which received an exclusive license from AstraZeneca to develop and commercialize the vaccine in this market in 2015.However, it was first approved as a trivalent vaccine, comprising three influenza strains, in the US and Europe in 2003 and 2011, respectively, and is now available as a quadrivalent vaccine in these markets.FluMist Quadrivalent reported 72% vaccine effectiveness among children 2-17 years of age in the UK during the 2021/2022 flu season. Stephanie Kurdach, infectious disease analyst at GlobalData, comments: “LAIVs such as FluMist Quadrivalent are particularly effective because of their route of administration. Unlike traditional vaccines that are administered as injections, LAIVs enter the body via the nasopharynx – the same route as the influenza virus – thereby allowing for an increase in mucosal immunity. LAIVs are also advantageous for the pediatric population, as young children can often be resistant to needles.”According to GlobalData, the approval of FluMist Quadrivalent in Japan has the potential to address an unmet need for more effective and convenient immunization of the pediatric population.However, key opinion leaders in Japan, who were interviewed by GlobalData in July, demonstrated limited awareness of the vaccine and did not express plans to use it for the upcoming flu season.Kurdach continues: “Perhaps the largest barrier for the uptake of FluMist Quadrivalent in Japan is the infrastructure surrounding health insurance policies.”With the exception of patients over 65 years, and patients aged 60-64 years with a qualifying underlying health condition, seasonal influenza vaccines are not covered by health insurance in Japan, so parents must pay to vaccinate their children.Additionally, doctors cannot choose which vaccine they administer to patients. Medical institutions calculate the number of vaccines needed for the entire influenza season and place an order from a single manufacturer.Kurdach concludes: “Medical institutions may be reluctant to order FluMist Quadrivalent, as it is only approved in a subset of patients who are not covered to receive the vaccine free of charge. The uptake of FluMist Quadrivalent in Japan may not be met with much success.” Copyright - Unless otherwise stated all contents of this web site are © 2024 - William Reed Ltd - All Rights Reserved - Full details for the use of materials on this site can be found in the Terms & Conditions Related topics Markets & regulation Related news Show more Moderna’s dual Covid and flu vaccine moves to final stages after positive data Moderna's updated COVID-19 vaccine receives positive CHMP opinion Vaxess announces $9 million in funding for mRNA vaccine patch Pfizer and BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine for children receives EU recommendation Show more Follow us Facebook Twitter Linkedin Webinars On-demand webinars Manufacturing Friendly Aggregate Clearance in Downstream Processing of Bispecific and Traditional Antibodies Using a Novel POROS Mixed-Mode Chromatography Media Thermo Fisher Scientific - Biosciences Headlines Aditum Bio and Leads Biolabs join forces in new company to fight autoimmune diseases Sarepta discontinues development of Duchenne ASO treatment vesleteplirsen Synaffix and BigHat Biosciences collaborate to develop AI-designed ADC EMA accepts Alvotech and Advanz Pharma’s Marketing Authorization Application for biosimilar of J&J’s Simponi AbbVie acquires Aliada Therapeutics in $1.4 billion deal Abzena announces major expansion of its biologics manufacturing facility Aldevron’s Anu Codaty on passion, leadership, and innovation AstraZeneca’s rare disease therapy Fasenra receives EU approval Follow us Facebook Twitter Linkedin BioPharma-Reporter Advertise with us Why Register?

Loss of smell—which can be partial or total—in itself is debilitating, but the distortion of sense of smell (parosmia) that can occur as a consequence of a viral upper respiratory tract infection (either alongside a reduction in sense of smell or as a solo symptom) can be very distressing for patients. Incidence of olfactory loss after SARS-CoV-2 infection has been estimated by meta-analysis to be around 50%, with more than one in three who will subsequently report parosmia. While early loss of sense of smell is thought to be due to infection of the supporting cells of the olfactory epithelium, the underlying mechanisms of persistant loss and parosmia remain less clear. Depletion of olfactory sensory neurones, chronic inflammatory infiltrates, and downregulation of receptor expression are thought to contribute. There are few effective therapeutic options, so support and olfactory training are essential. Further research is required before strong recommendations can be made to support treatment with steroids, supplements, or interventions applied topically or injected into the olfactory epithelium in terms of improving recovery of quantitative olfactory function. It is not yet known whether these treatments will also achieve comparable improvements in parosmia. This article aims to contextualise parosmia in the setting of post-viral olfactory dysfunction, explore some of the putative molecular mechanisms, and review some of the treatment options available.Back to topIntroductionOlfactory dysfunction can be categorised as being quantitative or qualitative (table 1). Quantitative dysfunction involves alterations in the strength or intensity of perception of odours; while qualitative dysfunction involves distortions (usually negative) to the quality and perception of odours. The two entities can coexist, with up to 60% of all patients with quantitative olfactory dysfunction experiencing some degree of qualitative dysfunction.1 2Table 1View inline|View popupQuantitative and qualitative dysfunctionsBack to topSources and selection criteriaWe searched PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Embase using the terms “olfactory dysfunction,” “anosmia,” and “parosmia” for articles published between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2022. These articles were reviewed and only those that specifically included patients with post-viral causes were included. We also reviewed reference lists from articles that we deemed to be high quality. Preference was given to randomised controlled trials, meta-analyses, international consensus guidelines, and systematic reviews that have informed these guidelines. We included smaller studies if they were of particular note or if other evidence was unavailable, for example, a case series that specifically included patients with parosmia owing to other available evidence being limited. In general, case reports and small case series were excluded.Back to topIncidence of post-viral olfactory dysfunctionLoss of smell after flu-like infection was first described in 1975.3 Since then, many reports and series have been published in the literature, and viral infections of the upper respiratory tract are now considered to be one of the most common causes of olfactory dysfunction, accounting for 18-45% of all cases.4–9 Viruses known to have the capability to induce olfactory dysfunctions include rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, influenza and parainfluenza viruses, enteroviruses, adenoviruses, and Epstein-Barr viruses.10–12 However, many patients seek assistance long after infection when the causative pathogen can no longer be determined. More recently, SARS-CoV-2 has been identified as a frequent cause of disruption to the sense of smell and has brought new focus to post-viral olfactory dysfunction.13–15 Incidence of olfactory dysfunction after SARS-CoV-2 infection has been estimated to be 47.9% by a meta-analysis that examined 83 studies of 27 492 patients.16 This one number fails to explain the variable incidence by geography, sex, SARS-CoV-2 variant, and subtype of olfactory dysfunction. The meta-analysis looked at each of these influences: studies performed in Europe showed a much higher rate of olfactory dysfunction than those in Asia (54.4% v 31.4%). Female individuals accounted for most patients—60.4%. Comparative analysis of olfactory dysfunction as caused by four different SARS-CoV-2 subtypes revealed that omicron was associated with fewer cases of olfactory dysfunction than the D614G, alpha, and delta variants.17Estimates of the frequency of parosmia after viral infection before SARS-CoV-2 are limited in the literature. One large Swedish population survey sampled 1713 individuals with questionnaires and structured interview regarding the presence of parosmia, and estimated a prevalence of self-identified parosmia of 3.9%,9 but the study lacked the ability to determine causality and temporal relation of parosmia to viral infection. The influence of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has seen an increase in the published estimates of parosmia—and yet, in the 2021 meta-analysis, the overwhelming contribution of data was from studies of quantitative olfactory dysfunction with only one study of qualitative loss suitable for inclusion. Individual studies that have followed patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who reported smell loss at the time of acute illness have suggested that 28-43% will have parosmia.18–20 Notably, many patients continued to have parosmia at six or 12 months.Back to topIdentification and quantification of olfactory dysfunctionTime constraints in the clinical environment can limit access to precise measurement of olfactory function, and in practice, we often rely on the patient’s response to the question “Have you noticed a change in your sense of smell?” While this first question is reasonable to open discussion, the sensitivity and specificity of an individual’s ability to detect loss of smell is variable. The usefulness of screening questions such as “Do you smell odours differently compared with previous experiences?” and “Do you smell odours in absence of an apparent source?” have been examined by Boscolo-Rizzo et al in an observational study of 98 patients21; the use of these screening questions suggested a higher prevalence of parosmia than would have been inferred through quantitative olfactory testing alone. In an observational study of 193 patients, Landis et al22 used a short structured questionnaire that not only indicated the presence or absence of parosmia, but also could be used to derive the severity of parosmia as low, medium, or high. Landis et al also followed this questionnaire with a further round of questions aimed at elucidating the impact of parosmia, and those patients with more severe parosmia had greater disruption to their function in eating behaviours and socialising, and were more likely to report weight loss.Psychophysical testing has proven to be more sensitive in detecting olfactory loss than subjective assessments, and measures the ability to detect validated odorant stimuli and to discriminate between different odours or thresholds for detection of certain odours. Several tests are commercially available, such as Sniffin’ Sticks, the University of Pennsylvania smell identification test, and the 12 item, brief smell identification test.23–25While radiological examination has a fairly minor role in the clinical evaluation of most patients with parosmia, some exploratory work using functional MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scanning26 has compared the activation patterns in the brains of patients with hyposmia and parosmia when presented with odours. While only a small group was examined, there were findings of interest in differential patterns of activation that might reflect the clinical symptoms shown by each group. Patients with hyposmia demonstrated seemingly typical olfactory stimulation patterns in the parahippocampal gyrus, insula, anterior cingulate cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex, which would be considered to show a so-called normal processing of olfactory stimuli, although reduced from the baseline of patients without hyposmia. By contrast, patients with parosmia showed stronger activation in the putamen—a structure that seems to be critical in recognition of signals of disgust—and the thalamus, which is thought to be responsible for regulating the direction of attention towards a stimulus. This functional MRI study therefore seems to offer objective correlation with the clinical symptoms reported by individuals with parosmia—that is, that they perceive odours as unpleasant and almost overpowering their ability to continue to function where others might perceive a pleasant odour but without it diverting attention from their daily tasks. Such studies are welcome in their addition to better understanding the consequences of olfactory dysfunction; the next section will further examine the underlying causes.Back to topMolecular mechanisms in non-SARS-CoV-2 post-viral olfactory dysfunctionAlthough post-viral anosmia has been recognised for many decades,3 investigative literature published before the covid-19 pandemic is scarce and based largely on small clinical series and experimental animal models.Transient loss of smell secondary to viral infections is often ascribed to the associated rhinitis causing inflammation and oedema of the nasal mucosa, resulting in physical impediment of odorant transit to the olfactory receptors. However, where post-viral olfactory dysfunction persists even after the acute nasal congestion, injury to the olfactory neuroepithelium or central processing pathways has been hypothesised to occur.4 27Initial investigations conducted in people with post-viral olfactory dysfunction consistently observed morphological and structural changes in the olfactory neuroepithelium. Particularly, ultrastructural findings revealed both a substantial reduction in the number of olfactory sensory neurons and microvillar cells, and also disorganisation of the epithelial architecture with olfactory sensory neurons possessing dendrites that did not reach the surface of the epithelium or that were devoid of sensory cilia.28 29 In an immunohistochemical study of 10 patients with olfactory dysfunction, neuron specific enolase immunoreactivity of the olfactory neuroepithelium was present in the early stage after common cold while completely absent in the late stage.30 Extensive scarring of the subepithelial tissue31 and pathological junctions between olfactory and respiratory epithelium have been identified, suggesting that respiratory metaplasia of the olfactory neuroepithelium might occur as a result of infection.28 However, no clear correlation exists between the severity of the ultrastructural and histological changes and the clinically detectable grade of olfactory dysfunction.28 32Reduction in the volume of olfactory neurons has been replicated in animal models where recombinant neurovirulent influenza A virus induced rapid tissue destruction of olfactory neuroepithelium and apoptosis of olfactory sensory neurons in mice.33 The induction of apoptosis was considered a strategy to prevent dissemination of neurovirulent viruses into the brain. However, a reduction in number of neurons alone does not fully correlate with clinical symptoms of olfactory loss, so further studies have sought to ascertain the effect of viral infection on the function of the remaining neurons. The effect of intranasal inoculation of Sendai virus (a murine counterpart of human parainfluenza virus, of which type 3 is the major suspected causative agent of post-viral olfactory dysfunction in humans34) was shown to impair the sense of smell. This impairment was caused by the virus weakening the ability of olfactory sensory neurons to take up calcium ions after stimulation by suppressing apoptosis of olfactory sensory neurons, thus impairing the normal regenerative ability of the olfactory epithelium. In this in vitro and in vivo model, Sendai virus was shown to persist in both olfactory neuroepithelium and bulb causing olfactory dysfunction but without easily detectable cytopathology.35Viral pathogens have evolved different strategies to invade the central nervous system, including the olfactory route. The detection of viral antigens, including influenza A virus, parainfluenza virus, and adenoviruses, within the olfactory mucosa and the olfactory bulb provided evidence for a potential route of virus entry into the central nervous system.36 Furthermore, damage to central olfactory pathways after intranasal inoculation of different viruses has been demonstrated in several animal studies.37 38 It is therefore not surprising for the olfactory neuroepithelium to have viral recognition systems. Animal models have shown that olfactory neuroepithelium and bulb can both mount an antiviral inflammatory response.36 39 40 Experiments conducted in zebrafish have shown that the interaction between receptors expressed by olfactory sensory neurons and fish rhabdoviruses glycoproteins led to a ultrarapid immune responses and the recruitment of non-conventional CD8 T cells to the olfactory mucosa from the olfactory bulb.39 By intranasal use of polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid, a synthetic analogue of viral double stranded RNA (which has been established as an immune model of viral infection), investigators observed that damage to the mouse olfactory neuroepithelium was attributed to the cytotoxic effect of elastase released by neutrophils that infiltrate the olfactory mucosa after an innate immune reaction depending on activation of toll-like receptor 3.40 This receptor is mainly expressed in the apical part of the supporting cells and in the cytoplasm of the acinar cells of Bowman’s glands. The olfactory ensheathing cells, Schwann cell-like glial cells, which supported olfactory sensory neurons axons from the olfactory neuroepithelium to the olfactory bulb, were identified as the source of innate cytokines and hypothesised to provide defence against neurotropic micro-organisms.36All these findings underly the importance of the olfactory neuroepithelium and bulb in surveillance and response to potential neuroinvasive viruses. However, the evidence suggests that this immune competence is counterbalanced by immune mediated inflammatory injury to the olfactory neuroepithelium and olfactory bulb. Figure 1 illustrates the putative mechanisms for viral infection induced hyposmia and anosmia.Request permissionFigure 1Putative mechanisms of post-viral olfactory dysfunction. CSF=cerebrospinal fluidBack to topMolecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 induced olfactory dysfunctionOlfactory dysfunction was found to be a highly prevalent symptom of SARS-CoV-2 infection41–43 during the early stages of the pandemic, although incidence has waned with more recent SARS-CoV-2 variants.17 Olfactory dysfunction is also one of the most predominant symptoms in long covid44–46; parosmia in particular has shown a tendency towards a drawn out natural history, with several studies confirming that a large number of patients will continue to have the condition more than six months after index SARS-CoV-2 infection.People infected with the early SARS-CoV-2 variants had a rapid onset and severity of anosmia with relatively little nasal congestion,15 44 which would argue against a conductive pathogenesis. MRI studies highlighted a selective inflammatory oedema of the olfactory cleft in the absence of obstacle to the air flow in the nasal cavities in a small number of patients, but other series showed that the olfactory cleft remained clear in the majority of patients.47–49Illustration of a relative lack of conductive blockade in SARS-CoV-2 related olfactory dysfunction has turned the spotlight to sensorineural mechanisms. Olfactory sensory neurons within the neuroepithelium are bipolar neurons that express the odorant receptors on numerous apical cilia that protrude into the nasal cavity and contain the molecular components for odour transduction.50 Olfactory sensory neurons are enveloped by sustentacular cells, a type of supporting column shaped cells. At the base of the olfactory epithelium are stem cells that are pluripotent and can replace both sustenacular cells and olfactory sensory neurons, forming a neurogenic niche with regenerative capabilities.51 52 Studies using single cell, RNA sequencing datasets and immunohistochemistry studies identified that sustentacular and pluripotent stem cells show the molecular makeup that makes these cells prone to SARS-CoV-2 infection—that is, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 2 receptor and transmembrane 2 serine protease (TMPRSS2). Conversely, these markers are not expressed by the olfactory sensory neurons.53–55 A hamster model of SARS-CoV-2 infection and human postmortem samples of olfactory neuroepithelium have correlated these findings—that sustentacular cells are the main target cells for SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication.56 57 The small number of infected neurons and lack of evidence of viral replication suggest that olfactory sensory neurons are not the prime direct target of SARS-CoV-2.58 Rather than direct injury, olfactory sensory neurons could be a downstream victim of sustentacular cell infection because the injured support cell is unable to sustain the olfactory sensory neuron function.The mechanism that leads to the damage of sustentacular cells after SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unclear. Syncytia formation has been hypothesised as one possible mechanism, based in part on extrapolation of findings of lung tissue in post mortem studies of patients who have died from acute SARS-CoV-2 infection.59–61 Syncytia formation are thought to contribute to viral replication through facilitating cell-cell spread while evading the extracellular environment and the innate immune system existent within it. SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interacts with the ACE2 receptor to produce virus-cell and cell-cell fusion with this process being amplified by the TMPRSS2 protease.59 The TMEM16F protein, a calcium-activated scramblase and ion channel60 has been shown to be involved in the formation of syncytia.61 ACE2 and TMEM16F were shown to be coexpressed both at RNA and protein levels in sustentacular cells, supporting the hypothesis of pathological syncytia formation.62Acute sustentacular injury might account for early phase olfactory dysfunction, but more widespread changes induced in the olfactory pathway by SARS-CoV-2 could account for longlasting symptoms. After infection, SARS-CoV-2 has been observed to disrupt the nuclear architecture and interfere with olfactory sensory neurons' transcriptome, influencing a persistent downregulation of olfactory receptor proteins and olfactory receptors signalling genes in human olfactory sensory neurons.58 Alterations in the central nervous system resulting from the inflammatory cascade associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection might also account for longlasting olfactory dysfunction, independent of direct viral induced injury. Initial concerns regarding the neurotropic potential of coronavirus facilitating retrograde spread through the olfactory system and into the central nervous system were refuted by the absence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in neural and glial bulbar and central compartments.56 63 64 Furthermore, ultrastructural and molecular alterations were rarely and inconsistently observed in central nervous system olfactory structures in patients with covid-19 who had died.56 64–66 In a post mortem assessment of olfactory bulb and tract tissues, axonal degeneration and microvascular endothelial injury were observed in the absence of viral infection, suggesting that these alterations might be the result of immune system activation and inflammation.66 Sampling of olfactory tissues from patients showing long term persistence of covid-19 associated anosmia revealed the presence of inflammatory transcriptional signature for interleukin (IL) 6, type I interferon, and CXC motif chemokine ligand (CXCL10).67 In another post mortem study, the olfactory bulb of patients with covid-19 showed a high degree of astrogliosis and microgliosis and a minor infiltration by cytotoxic T lymphocytes.68 T cell infiltration, partial depletion of olfactory sensory neurones, and the absence of detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA have also been seen in biopsies taken from patients with objectively proven persistent olfactory loss after covid-19.69By comparing MRI before and after SARS-CoV-2 infection, brain related abnormalities mainly affecting the limbic and olfactory cortical systems were observed.70 These alterations were interpreted as the consequence of repeated olfactory sensory deprivation rather than the cause of smell loss, with loss of sensory input leading to a loss of grey matter in these olfactory related brain regions. Similarly, the decreased olfactory bulb volume observed in several studies is likely due to the loss of trophic stimuli from the olfactory neuroepithelium.71Back to topPathophysiology of parosmiaFor many years, the most plausible hypothesis for parosmia was thought to be aberrant regeneration of olfactory neurons after the acute viral insult, with so-called miswiring, resulting in resulting in neurons that would normally be associated with foul smells being triggered by inoffensive odour molecules. This theory was described by Doty in 197972 and is an attractive hypothesis for several reasons—in particular, the observation that many instances of parosmia occur 45-60 days after viral infection, a timescale that parallels the period required for regeneration of olfactory receptors. This miswiring theory after injury to olfactory neurons has been shown in murine models,73 where transection of the olfactory nerve has been observed to result in the disruption of the odour map. Loss of the proper axonal organisation leads to incorrect projection of axons to their appropriate glomeruli targets and thus is thought to lead to central mischaracterisation of odours.Although this theory was held as plausible for several decades, the vast numbers of patients affected by SARS-CoV-2 associated olfactory dysfunction has refocused attention on the subject. Authors such as Parker et al74 have observed that key characteristics of parosmia are not entirely explained by the miswiring theory—for example, where aberrant axonal regeneration would be expected to be random and irregular, there is a typical battery of odours hat commonly trigger parosmia in individuals (such as coffee, meat, egg, garlic, and onion) that are consistently perceived as faecal and foul. Parker and colleagues attempted to expand on the current understanding of peripheral mechanisms of parosmia by testing the hypothesis that parosmia is due to incomplete characterisation of all the constituent components of an odour. They tested this theory using a group of patients with parosmia, both secondary to SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses, who identified coffee as a newly offensive odour. The study group was exposed to specific molecular components that comprised the coffee odour and asked to identify which component triggered parosmia. This study showed not only an incomplete characterisation of odours, but also a common set of compounds with low odour threshold (ie, they were detectable even at very low concentration) that tended to trigger parosmia in patients. This model of unopposed detection of highly volatile odour compounds without the counterbalance of detection of other, more pleasant, odour profile aspects could account for the regular and non-random range of triggers described by individuals with parosmia.Investigation of central causes of parosmia have been aided by the development of increasingly sophisticated imaging studies. MRI studies of parosmia in the early 2000s where simple volumetry showed a reduction in olfactory bulb volume in patients with qualitative loss compared with those with pure quantitative loss.75 76 These studies have evolved to those showing specific loss of grey matter in anatomical regions of patients with parosmia such as the anterior insula, anterior insulate complex, and hippocampus that are critical to odour discrimination and memory,77 as well as functional studies showing differential activation of central pathways in patients with parosmia on exposure to typically inoffensive odours.26 MRI has also been combined with fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) scanning to illustrate hypometabolism in insula and hippocampus in a case report of a patient with parosmia.78 Rapid development of ever more detailed imaging studies will no doubt continue to uncover further subtleties in the central pathways affected by parosmia. But whether these observed central changes reflect the cause or effect of parosmia remains unclear. However, an interplay seems likely between both central pathways and peripheral mechanisms of aberrant odour presentation that result in development of parosmia and its persistence in some individuals. Figure 2 illustrates theories of the pathophysiology of parosmia.Request permissionFigure 2Potential mechanisms of parosmia.

(B) Viral induced disruption of the neuroepithelium, with loss of olfactory sensory neurons, sustenacular cells, and basal cells. (C) In the so-called miswiring hypothesis of parosmia, aberrant neural regeneration leads to formation of random and incorrect axonal connection. (D) In the hypothesis of incomplete neural regeneration of parosmia, whereby correct axonal regeneration occurs but only for selected receptor types, leading to incomplete characterisation and misclassification of an odour owing to failure to detect all odour molecular componentsBack to topOutcomes after post-viral olfactory dysfunctionThe prognosis for patients with long term olfactory dysfunction is uncertain, with scope for spontaneous recovery at least three years from onset.79 80 Lee et al80 prospectively evaluated 63 patients with post-viral olfactory loss using telephone interviews. Patients were asked to subjectively evaluate their olfactory performance on a 100 point scale, and followed for a mean duration of 33.4 months. The researchers saw subjective improvement in olfactory dysfunction in 85.7% of patients, and a return to normosmia in 31.7% of patients. In a retrospective analysis of 791 patients with post-viral olfactory dysfunction evaluated using Sniffin’ Sticks testing, Cavazzana et al81 reported that 46% of patients who initially had anosmia showed clinically significant improvement in olfactory function, as did 35% of patients who initially had hyposmia. Mean follow-up for these patients was 23 months. Overall, a steady rate of recovery is noted up until around one year, after which the rate of recovery slows steadily. After covid-19, the reported prevalence of olfactory dysfunction was 27-60% at six months,44 82 83 26.5-46% at one year,83 84 and 8.3% at two years.20Mechanisms that underpin a prolonged recovery course are not fully understood, but some predictive factors have been associated with a higher recovery rate85: patients without coexisting nasal congestion; younger age,79 80 non-smokers,86 higher number of receptor cells and intact nerve bundles at the olfactory epithelium biopsy,32 presence of olfactory event-related potentials,87 and a narrow width of olfactory bulb when measured radiographically88; and lower severity and duration80 86 89 of olfactory dysfunction at the first visit. Female individuals have notably lower rates of recovery, although the reasons for this are not clear and might be influenced by baseline olfactory function and the influence of oestrogen on the ACE2 receptor.85Back to topOutcomes after parosmiaRecovery from parosmia runs a variable course. Some evidence indicates that presence of parosmia after a viral infection could be associated with increased likelihood of eventual olfactory recovery86 90 compared with those individuals with pure quantitative loss, but other studies have failed to replicate these findings.90 This heterogeneity might in part be due to baseline regenerative capacity, which declines with age91; cause of olfactory dysfunction; and duration and method of follow-up. It also reflects some fundamental research questions in the specialty—namely, how to objectively measure parosmia and how to define recovery as anything other than a binary presence or absence. Most studies have used measures of recovery using quantitative testing and have defined recovery of olfactory function in these quantitative terms, with difficulty in exploring the recovery of parosmia as a symptom.The vast number of patients affected by SARS-CoV-2 olfactory dysfunction has allowed large scale studies to help resolve some of these questions of recovery in this specific cohort. A prospective multicentric study studied 147 patients with olfactory dysfunction after self-reported upper respiratory tract infection, and were separated into those with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, and those without. Patients underwent testing with Sniffin’ Sticks at presentation and at first follow-up visit, at a mean of 3.4 months follow-up. In addition, patients were asked questions regarding the intensity, frequency, and functional consequences of parosmia. This study showed that patients with parosmia, and particularly younger patients with parosmia, were more likely to recover olfactory function than those without parosmia.92 Patients with and without SARS-CoV-2 showed a similar improvement over the two visits, although patients with SARS-CoV-2 had a higher baseline of olfactory function.There is reason for cautious optimism for most patients, because although recovery might be slow after initial SARS-CoV-2 infection (with large numbers still with parosmia at six months),44 about 85% of patients will no longer report qualitative olfactory dysfunction after two years.93Back to topManagement of post-viral olfactory dysfunctionNon-drug treatmentsTable 2 gives a summary of the evidence regarding non-drug treatments for post-viral olfactory dysfunction.Table 2View inline|View popupNon-drug treatment options for post-viral olfactory dysfunctionCounsellingPersistent olfactory disorders and their effects on patients' quality of life might be underestimated by both general practitioners and otolaryngologists.94 Ninety five per cent of patients report that they have not been able to obtain any counselling before referral to a tertiary centre with special interest in the treatment of smell disorders.95Olfactory dysfunction is associated with depression,96 and patients with more severe quantitative loss have more severe depression scores as measured by validated questionnaires such as the Beck depression inventory. Patients with parosmia and quantitative olfactory dysfunction show greater disruption to their daily life than patients with quantitative olfactory impairment alone; there are barriers to activities such as cooking, eating, and social interaction owing to an association with foul smell perception.97 Their overall quality of life is worse than those individuals with pure quantitative loss.Olfactory trainingFirst proposed by Hummel et al in a non-randomised controlled trial of 56 patients in 2009,98 evidence suggests that olfactory training might be useful in the treatment of both quantitative and qualitative post-viral olfactory disorders.99–103 The mechanisms underlying its effectiveness are not fully understood but has been hypothesised to either harness the regenerative capacity of neurons at the level of the olfactory epithelium through exposure to repeated olfactory stimuli104 105; or more plausibly to have a top-down effect is also possible because olfactory training also induces cortical thickening in the olfactory area of the brain,105 strengthening of olfactory, somatosensory and integrative networks,106 and volumetric increase in the olfactory bulb.107 The second hypothesis is also supported by the meta-analysis by Sorokowska et al,108 which analysed 11 studies totalling 879 patients. The investigators found that olfactory training has a significantly positive effect on olfactory ability as measured by the Sniffin’ Sticks test (Hedges g 1.10, 95% confidence interval 0.459 to 1.734). The effects are greatest in the ability to discriminate (0.89, 0.498 to 1.298) and identify (0.833, 0.264 to 1.402); and small to moderate in lowering the olfactory threshold for detection of odours (0.336, 0.103 to 0.569).In the classic olfactory training protocol, patients use four odorants and consciously spend 10 seconds smelling each, twice a day, for three months.98 Over time, modifications of this protocol have been proposed, extending the duration up to eight months,102 103 109 periodically changing the odorants102 or increasing their concentration103 with potential benefits on the effectiveness of the treatment.To date, olfactory training is the one treatment with effectiveness most solidly demonstrated for post-viral olfactory dysfunctions. For this reason, and because of the absence of side effects and the ease of access, olfactory training is recommended by expert consensus as the first line treatment for post-viral olfactory loss.110–113The application of olfactory training in parosmia has also been tested in a study of 153 patients with post-infection olfactory dysfunction,114 which showed that those with parosmia were more likely to benefit from meaningful improvement in their ability to identify and discriminate odours than patients with quantitative loss only. The authors of this study hypothesised that this finding could be related to central mechanisms of parosmia where incomplete or incorrect presentation of odour stimuli can be reordered through the top-down influence of olfactory training.Drug treatmentsTable 3 presents a summary of the evidence surrounding drug treatments in post-viral olfactory dysfunction.Table 3View inline|View popupDrug treatment options for post-viral olfactory dysfunctionCorticosteroidsThe use of both oral and topical corticosteroids in post-viral olfactory dysfunction has been investigated, although not with specific reference to parosmia. With the caveat of limited evidence, support is expressed for topical steroids delivered as a rinse, with significant improvement shown when used alongside olfactory training compared with use of olfactory training alone.115 Topical steroid rinses are generally well tolerated, with a relatively benign side effect profile including nasal drying and mild epistaxis. Topical steroid sprays, by contrast, have limited available evidence for evaluation. A double blind, randomised controlled trial has investigated the use of topical steroid sprays in 40 patients who were previously treated with oral steroids; no additional benefit was seen in those receiving topical sprays.116 For a systematic review of the use of corticosteroids in olfactory dysfunction after SARS-CoV-2 infection, researchers performed an analysis of all forms of intranasal corticosteroid delivery, both in rinse and spray form.117 They identified five studies for inclusion, totalling 696 patients studied, and found no significant difference (odds ratio 1.43, P=0.08) in the rate of recovery from olfactory dysfunction between the treatment and control groups.Oral steroid use receives only weak support from the international consensus document, with a recommendation for their use only after discussion regarding the risks and benefits for each individual patient.111 A randomised controlled trial that allocated 115 patients with post-covid-19 olfactory dysfunction to receive prednisolone or placebo showed no benefit in systemic steroids.118 Therefore, the use of systemic steroids has to be carefully considered in its risk/benefit profile for each patient with counselling regarding their well known adverse effects.Calcium buffersIntranasal sodium citrate is a calcium sequestrant, reducing free mucosal calcium with subsequent inhibition of negative feedback and increasing sensitivity to odours. It has a positive effect on olfaction that lasts minutes to hours, as seen in one randomised controlled trial119 and one relatively small trial where 49 patients acted as their own control using the contralateral nostril.120 The authors of this second trial performed a second follow-up study that followed patients using the same protocol over prolonged use of intranasal calcium citrate.121 Despite no effect noted on quantitative function, a reduction was seen in the proportion of patients reporting phantosmia (though not parosmia). This finding suggests that this treatment might be a promising avenue for investigation of the use of intranasal sodium citrate in olfactory dysfunction, and given its low side effect profile, remains an option for treatment in patients with post-viral olfactory dysfunction.Vitamin AVitamin A has been hypothesised to have favourable effects in neural regeneration, and as such has been studied in both topical/intranasal and systemic use in patients with post-viral olfactory dysfunction. Topical vitamin A seems to be the more promising format, as shown in a retrospective cohort trial (n=124) by Hummel et al.122 Patients with olfactory dysfunction after infection received both olfactory training and topical vitamin A, and their olfactory outcomes were compared with a cohort of patients receiving olfactory training alone. The addition of vitamin A resulted in significantly better quantitative olfactory function at 12 weeks, although with the noted limitation that no randomisation was performed in this cohort study. The same group of researchers did an earlier trial of systemic vitamin A in 52 patients with both post-infectious and post-traumatic olfactory loss with no evidence of benefit123; with no other high quality studies performed to counter this evidence. Therefore, while the evidence for intranasal vitamin A is weakly in favour, there are sufficient grounds for the International Consensus of Allergy and Rhinology authors to make recommendations against systemic vitamin A.Palmitoylethanolamide and luteolinPalmitoylethanolamide and luteolin (PEA-LUT) are hypothesised to reduce neuroinflammation by modulating microglia and reducing reactive oxygen species; and as such, have been applied to patients with post-viral olfactory dysfunction. In a double blind, randomised, placebo controlled trial of PEA-LUT, 92% of 130 patients in the intervention group showed an improvement in olfactory function versus 42% of 55 controls at 90 days.124 Further studies will be needed to understand by what mechanism PEA-LUT influences recovery of olfaction, and to replicate these results to support its efficacy in post-viral olfactory disorders.Omega 3Omega 3 are fatty acids that normally make up cell membranes. Omega 3 supplementation has a therapeutic potential via direct neuroprotective effects and increases production of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory amino acids. Its use has been proposed by Yan et al in a randomised controlled study of 87 patients in 2020125 for the treatment of olfactory dysfunctions resulting from endoscopic approaches to sellar and parasellar tumours. At three and six months, patients treated with the omega 3 supplement showed a significantly lower rate of persistent olfactory dysfunction than controls. Given the relatively minor and infrequent side effects, supplementation with omega 3 is a therapeutic option that can be taken into consideration, despite the need for larger studies to establish its effectiveness in post-viral olfactory dysfunctions.Platelet rich plasmaPlatelet rich plasma is an autologous biological product derived from the patient’s blood, and is rich in platelets and pro-regenerative factors. In a pilot study by Yan et al,48 ,126 platelet rich plasma was inoculated into the olfactory clefts of seven patients with severe post-viral olfactory disorders. These results were then consolidated with a follow-up study from the same group.127 The follow-up study randomised patients to either a course of three injections of plasma rich plasma to the olfactory epithelium delivered over a four week interval, or saline injections over the same interval. The results indicated that injection with platelet rich plasma resulted in a significantly improved olfaction score at three months as measured by threshold and discrimination scores of Sniffin’ Sticks. However, no difference was seen in the patients’ subjective assessment of their olfactory function. The authors also found no change in the proportion of patients reporting parosmia after platelet rich plasma. This well designed study illustrates the complex nature of olfactory dysfunction research, in that there is an imperfect correlation between objective improvement on observed measures but without meaningful impact on the patient. Nonetheless, the hypothesis tested in this study—that platelet rich plasma might have a positive influence on peripheral regeneration of olfactory epithelium—is promising and a potential avenue for further investigation.GabapentinAlthough not tested in a randomised or controlled trial, the use of gabapentin in a small case series of nine patients is worthy of mention because it specifically examined its use in patients with parosmia.128 In this case series, 12 patients with parosmia consented to an empirical trial of gabapentin, with titration from 100 mg daily to a maximum of 600 mg daily. This treatment was combined with topical steroid rinse and a form of olfactory training. Two patients were unable to tolerate gabapentin’s side effects, while one patient stopped taking it before the defined endpoint of three weeks of maximal tolerated dose. Of the nine patients who were able to tolerate the maximum dose of gabapentin for three weeks, eight reported clinically significant improvements in their symptom of parosmia. At follow-up, two patients who attempted to wean from gabapentin reported worsening of symptoms while one was able to stop without recurrence. Although this series of observed outcomes is very small, it holds interest for the use of neuromodulators in the treatment of parosmia. The relatively high dropout rate speaks to the difficulty that many patients will have in tolerating this treatment, and as such, it should be the subject of further robust investigation before an unequivocal recommendation for use.Back to topEmerging treatmentsTraditionally, treatments aimed at postviral olfactory dysfunction have often aimed at the presumptive inflammatory or conductive component, with corticosteroids delivered either topically or systemically. However, the emerging understanding of the central pathways of post-viral olfactory dysfunction and parosmia in particular have seen attention turn towards neuromodulators and agents that can positively influence neural regeneration. As described above, some promising evidence supports agents such as topical vitamin A, PEA/LUT, and platelet rich plasma injections to the olfactory mucosa. Gabapentin has only the very earliest suggestion of efficacy, but represents a notable angle on systemic neuromodulation. When combined with the top-down reordering of olfactory pathways as influenced by olfactory training, it seems certain that future developments in the treatment of olfactory disorders will address the peripheral and central neural pathways rather than inflammation at a purely mucosal level.Back to topGuidelinesAt present, limited therapeutic options are available for patients with post-viral olfactory disorders. There is a lack of randomised trials with appropriate controlled arms and reliable olfactory assessment. This paucity was mentioned in the 2022 guideline, the International Consensus Statement in Allergy and Rhinology: Olfaction.111 This guideline was the result of a wide ranging review that comprehensively looked at published evidence in olfactory therapeutics but with only one (olfactory training) reaching an outcome of unequivocal recommendation.111 The quality of evidence was noted to be particularly low in the specific question of parosmia. This consensus document, although exhaustive in its review of published data, is limited in its ability to rapidly respond to evolving evidence that emerges after its publication. Living reviews such as the Cochrane Review of post-SARS-CoV-2 olfactory dysfunction have attempted to resolve this limitation,112 by continually being updated according to the availability of data. Again, the evidence at this review was noted to be sparse when considering published randomised controlled trials. Case reports and cohort studies abound, but are limited in their interpretation owing to the natural history for parosmia to improve over time regardless of intervention. As such, this review will also limit its consideration to interventions with a specified control group, or systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the topic.Back to topConclusionsThe high prevalence of olfactory dysfunction after infection with SARS-CoV-2 has provided an unseen opportunity to study the underlying pathophysiological mechanism of post-viral olfactory loss, with considerable advances in the field, which could yield novel therapeutic options. However, the underlying mechanism and treatments for qualitative olfactory disordersr remain elusive, yet the large burden of disease following the pandemic makes this an important focus of future research.Questions for further researchWhat percentage of patients with olfactory dysfunction currently classified as idiopathic could have an identifiable cause if biomarkers of disease were present?What are the patient and disease predictors of olfactory recovery after viral infection?Could early use of interventions such as olfactory training in post-viral olfactory dysfunction prevent the development of parosmia?Patient involvementThe content of this article was reviewed by a fellow healthcare worker who had post-viral olfactory dysfunction and parosmia after contracting SARS-CoV-2 in the first wave of the pandemic in 2020. In addition, the present review references work from the UK charities AbScent and Fifth Sense, who have been heavily involved in high quality, patient centred, olfactory research.Back to topFootnotesReferencesPublication historyRapid ResponsesOverviewAbstractIntroductionSources and selection criteriaIncidence of post-viral olfactory dysfunctionIdentification and quantification of olfactory dysfunctionMolecular mechanisms in non-SARS-CoV-2 post-viral olfactory dysfunctionMolecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 induced olfactory dysfunctionPathophysiology of parosmiaOutcomes after post-viral olfactory dysfunctionOutcomes after parosmiaManagement of post-viral olfactory dysfunctionEmerging treatmentsGuidelinesConclusionsReferencesFootnotesPublication historyRapid ResponsesArticle metricsAltmetricDimensionsCONTENTLatest ContentArchiveBrowse by TopicTop Cited ArticlesJOURNALAboutEditorial TeamEditorial BoardSign up for email alertsThank you to our reviewersAUTHORSInstructions for authorsSubmit an articleEditorial policiesOpen Access at BMJHELPContact usReprintsPermissionsAdvertisingFeedback formWebsite Terms & ConditionsPrivacy & CookiesContact BMJCookie settingsOnline ISSN: 2754-0413Copyright © 2024 BMJ Publishing Group Ltd.

Image: MAGNIFIER via Shutterstock. AstraZeneca’s live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV), FluMist, is an intranasal inoculation that was first approved as a trivalent vaccine in the US and Europe in 2003 and 2011, respectively. On 27 March 2023, nearly a decade after Daiichi Sankyo received an exclusive licence from AstraZeneca to develop and commercialise FluMist Quadrivalent in Japan, the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare confirmed its approval, making it the first for an intranasal vaccine in Japan. FluMist Quadrivalent will be available for use in Japan for the 2023–24 influenza season for children aged 2–18 years.

Find out more Related Company ProfilesAstraZeneca PlcDaiichi Sankyo Co LtdView all LAIVs such as FluMist Quadrivalent are particularly effective because of their route of administration. Unlike traditional vaccines, which are administered as injections, LAIVs enter the body via the nasopharynx—the same route as the influenza virus. By administering the vaccine intranasally, this allows for an increase in mucosal immunity, thereby providing an increased first line of defence. LAIVs are also advantageous for the pediatric population, as young children can often be resistant to needles. FluMist Quadrivalent reported a 72% vaccine effectiveness among children ages 2–17 years in the UK during the 2021–2022 influenza season. AstraZeneca’s reported global sales for FluMist Quadrivalent for the 2022–2023 influenza season reached $175m. However, Europe dominated the market share with $151m (>86%) in sales. Following this, the US was responsible for $21m (12%) in sales, with the rest of the world (ROW) sales making up the remaining $3m (<2%). The approval of FluMist Quadrivalent in Japan has the potential to address an unmet need for more effective and convenient immunisation of the paediatric population. However, key opinion leaders (KOLs) in Japan who were interviewed by GlobalData in July demonstrated limited awareness of the vaccine and did not express plans to use it for the upcoming influenza season. One potential barrier to the uptake of FluMist Quadrivalent in Japan is the infrastructure surrounding health insurance policies. With the exception of patients ages 65 years and older, as well as patients ages 60–64 years with a qualifying underlying health condition, seasonal influenza vaccines are not covered by health insurance in Japan. As such, parents must pay to vaccinate their children. Additionally, doctors cannot choose which vaccine they administer to patients. Medical institutions calculate the number of vaccines needed for the entire influenza season and place an order from a single manufacturer. Medical institutions may be reluctant to order FluMist Quadrivalent, as it is only approved for a subset of patients who are not covered to receive the vaccine free of charge. FluMist Quadrivalent is almost exclusively administered to children aged 2–17 years in the UK, where it is sold under the name Fluenz Tetra. The National Health Service (NHS) runs an annual program in which the LAIV is offered to children through their school’s vaccination program. Children from reception (aged 4–5 years) through year 11 (aged 15–16 years) are eligible to receive the vaccine free of charge. How well do you really know your competitors?

KOLs from the UK considered the school immunization program to be highly beneficial, particularly as these types of programs are generally unavailable in other countries around the world. They cited numerous benefits to utilising the LAIV among children. These include the proven effectiveness of the vaccine, the mucosal immunity derived from the route of administration, the ease of administration, and the cost-effectiveness of the vaccine. Regarding the future of seasonal influenza vaccines, UK KOLs stated that they would like to see an increase in intranasal vaccine options, citing mucosal immunity as the top benefit. According to GlobalData’s pipeline product database, there are 24 intranasal vaccines in development for influenza infections globally, seven of which are LAIVs, indicating some degree of commercial interest in the further development of these vaccines.

Both adults and children are coming in with complaints of high fever, cold and cough, and in rare cases, stomach problems. MUMBAI: After about a month of rain in the city, doctors spoke about at least a 50% increase in patients presenting with flu-like illnesses, and a high percentage of respiratory samples testing positive for flu.Both adults and children are coming in with complaints of high fever, cold and cough, and in rare cases, stomach problems. Often individuals are experiencing prolonged flu episodes lasting from 8 to 15 days, leaving them extremely weak and fragile.The doctors are warning that the predominant strain appears to be the influenza A virus subtype H3N2, but influenza B viruses are also circulating (see box).Infectious disease expert Dr Vasant Nagvekar, who consults with Lilavati Hospital, said there was a tremendous rise in seasonal flu infections. "A majority of my patients are testing positive for H3N2," he said. The doctor has had to even hospitalise some patients, mostly senior citizens with comorbidities and severe flu symptoms. "It is important to start oseltamivir on time to prevent further complications,"said Dr Nagvekar.Physician Pratit Samdani concurred that oseltamivir should be started within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms to maximise therapeutic benefits. "Once H3N2 or H1N1 infection has been confirmed, it is imperative to initiate oseltamivir treatment without delay," he said.Early administration of oseltamivir significantly reduces the recovery time, Dr Samdani explained. On several occasions, valuable time is wasted in treating the flu with regular paracetamol during the initial days. The flu this season is marked by high fever. "Some patients have fainted due to high fever," he said.In March, a significant surge in H3N2 cases was observed, leading to the state's first reported mortality resulting from a combined infection of H3N2 and Covid-19. Physician Dr Hemant Thacker, who consults with Breach Candy Hospital, said it felt as if the flu season was starting up again. "Many flu patients are exhibiting both respiratory and gastric symptoms," he said, adding that H3N2 and influenza B viruses are driving the spread. In Thacker's experience, patients are presenting with persistent high fever lasting 3-4 days, accompanied by severe body aches and weakness.Children have not been spared by the flu, said paediatrician Bakul Parekh. His outpatient department has registered a 50% increase in footfall in the past week. "Children are coming with cold, cough, fever, and loose motion in huge numbers, but admissions are not very high," he said. Children are mostly recovering in 5-7 days, but many have a cough for weeks. Dr Thacker said going ahead, the intensity of rain will decide if vector-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue will triumph over viruses in the coming weeks.End of ArticleFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA Visual Stories Previous9 most unique and rare birds in the worldLifestyle10 foods that contain highest protein per 100 gramsLifestyle8 Indian cities where non-vegetarian food is bannedFoodHow to make South-Indian style Chicken PakoraFood10 lines from Shakespeare's sonnets that are profound life lessonsLifestyleMost beautiful hill stations in the Western Ghats for a serene vacationtravel8 yoga poses that can reduce waist size effectivelyLifestyle7 home remedies to remove yellow stains from teethLifestyle10 books that will help transform your life in the next 3 monthsLifestyleGanesh Chaturthi 2024: 10 South Indian dishes to make for Lord GaneshaFood Next123Hot PicksFastest Trains in the WorldWho is Jared IsaacmanAlberto FujimoriHaitian ImmigrantsStock Market TodayShimla Mosque ViolenceAyushman Bharat Insurance SchemeTOP TRENDINGCSIR UGC NET 2024 ResultsSitaram YechuryIphone 16 vs Iphone 15Vande Bharat Express TrainLargest Mammals in the WorldSunil GavaskarHamster Kombat Daily Cipher CodesShimla Mosque RowKing CharlesDiljit Dosanjh Concert Tickets OnlineTrending StoriesIn CityEntire WebsiteBreathtaking cosmic catwalk!

GC Biopharma said on Wednesday that its quadrivalent flu vaccine, GC FLU Quadrivalent inj. has been approved as a drug product by the Egyptian Drug Authority (EDA). (Credit: GC Biopharma) Egypt has one of the largest pharmaceutical markets in the African region, with the flu vaccine market estimated at $45 million in 2022. GC Biopharma is the largest manufacturer of seasonal flu vaccines for the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) and the United Nations Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF), supplying flu vaccines to 63 countries worldwide. GC FLU Quadrivalent inj. has been internationally recognized for its safety and efficacy based on its flu vaccine manufacturing technology, expanding the number of export countries and volumes annually. The company plans to expand its global territory from the existing flu vaccine market centered on Southeast Asia and Latin America to the Africa-Middle East region based on the approval of this item in Egypt. "The trend of switching to quadrivalent influenza vaccines is expanding not only in the procurement market of international organizations but also in individual countries overseas," said a company official. "By simultaneously targeting the procurement market of international organizations and the private market of individual countries, we will draw synergies to increase sales and improve profitability." The flu vaccine market is divided into the international organization procurement market, which is represented by PAHO and UNICEF. The private market accounts for the remainder which supplies medicines after approval of the product by each country. The international procurement market has the advantage of being able to supply large quantities to the National Immunization Program (NIP) market while the private market offers marginal profitability as the supply price is set according to the market environment of each country. "We will continue to increase our global market share based on our vaccine technology and manufacturing capabilities that we have been producing and supplying vaccines for half a century," said GC Biopharma CEO Huh Eun-chul. tweet Related articles Korea to create ‘Global Bio Campus’ to train foreign manufacturing workers ‘Training future workforce to develop next-gen mRNA therapeutics requires close collab’ SK bioscience, Sanofi's pneumococcal vaccine shows strong efficacy in p2 study GC Biopharma, Novel Pharma's Sanfilippo Syndrome treatment candidate receives orphan drug status in EU GC Holdings to establish diagnostic and interpretation institution in Vietnam Marianne Chang mchang@docdocdoc.co.kr See Other Articles Copyright © KBR Unauthorized reproduction, redistribution prohibited News That You Haven't Seen Mediwhale wins 1st place in MICCAI’s medical AI competition Falls and trips, primary reasons for older adults’ injuries, while youngsters must be careful about electric scooters [Interview] ‘Pediatric care will revive, so don't give up and stay with us’ Potential new cure found for treating glioblastoma resistant to immunotherapy Macular degeneration cases mark a 2.5-fold increase in 5 years Huons to acquire PanGen Biotech to boost biopharma R&D, CDMO biz Philips Korea to launch digital pathology reference site at Seoul Clinical Laboratories Mediwhale wins 1st place in MICCAI’s medical AI competition Comments Log In 작성자 비밀번호 댓글 내용입력 0 / 400 Submit 댓글 정렬 Newest Recommended Top Comments BEST Comments BEST Comments It is automatically exposed by adding up the number of replies and recommendations. 닫기 More Delete comments Deleted comments cannot be recovered.

Though invisible to the naked eye, these tiny pathogens have the power to upend societies, redefine cultural norms, and bring about seismic shifts in human history. In this article, we delve into the science behind seven of the deadliest viruses that have crossed paths with humanity. Their devastation is undeniable, but their existence also sparked remarkable strides in scientific research and medical innovation.1. HIV/AIDS: A Slow-Moving PandemicThe Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) incites Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), a disease that has claimed an estimated 32.7 million lives worldwide since its identification in the early 1980s. This retrovirus attacks the immune system, leaving the body vulnerable to opportunistic infections and diseases. Astonishingly, HIV integrates its genetic material into the host's DNA, making it incredibly difficult to eliminate.The science behind HIV has led to significant strides in antiretroviral therapy, turning a once fatal disease into a manageable chronic condition. Today, medical science continues its race to find a cure, aiming to eliminate the virus entirely from the body.2. Influenza: A Shape-Shifting AssassinInfluenza, commonly known as the flu, can trace its history back to the 16th century. Its deadliest strain, H1N1, known as the Spanish flu, decimated a third of the world's population in 1918. Its ability to mutate rapidly enables the virus to evade our immune system with ease.The challenge of combating influenza has resulted in leaps forward in viral genetics. Influenza's high mutation rate has led scientists to develop yearly vaccines, designed to keep up with the ever-changing strains. This research has paved the way for the development of mRNA vaccines, a tool that proved invaluable during the COVID-19 pandemic.3. Ebola: A Deadly InvaderEmerging from Central Africa, the Ebola virus wreaks havoc on the human body, causing severe fever, bleeding, and ultimately organ failure. Its zoonotic origin, spreading from animals to humans, is a stark reminder of our interconnected world.The science behind Ebola has been a study in urgency. The 2014-2016 West African outbreak expedited the development of the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine, marking a significant milestone in the fight against this deadly virus.4. Zika: A Silent TerrorThe Zika virus, transmitted primarily through the Aedes mosquito, was relatively unknown until the 2015 outbreak in Brazil, which was linked to a steep rise in microcephaly cases in newborns. The virus's ability to cross the placental barrier and impact fetal brain development highlighted the complexity of virus-host interactions.The urgent need to understand and combat Zika spurred on remarkable advancements in diagnostic methods, vector control strategies, and potential vaccine candidates.5. Smallpox: The Vanquished FoeSmallpox, an incredibly contagious and deadly disease caused by the Variola virus, plagued humanity for centuries before it was declared eradicated in 1980 through a worldwide vaccination programme - an unparalleled achievement in medical history.The science behind the smallpox vaccine not only led to the disease's eradication but also laid the groundwork for modern immunology, providing valuable lessons on global cooperation and public health strategy.6. Polio: An Enemy in RetreatPoliovirus, a pathogen that attacks the nervous system, often leading to paralysis, has been pushed to the brink of eradication, thanks to the development of effective vaccines. Despite its crippling effects, the struggle against polio demonstrated the power of global vaccination campaigns and international cooperation.The fight against polio also contributed to our understanding of the "herd immunity" concept, an essential aspect of infectious disease control.7. COVID-19: The Contemporary CrisisLast but certainly not least, SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, has swept the globe, causing widespread illness and disruption. This virus’s unique features, including its spike protein, which allows it to bind and enter human cells, has been the centre of intense scientific focus.The science behind COVID-19 has seen unprecedented progress in vaccine development, with multiple effective vaccines manufactured within a year of the virus’s emergence. The scientific and societal response to this virus will undoubtedly shape the way we approach pandemics in the future.From HIV to COVID-19, these seven viruses have caused significant human suffering, but they have also paved the way for remarkable scientific discoveries. Our ongoing battle with these pathogens underpins the crucial importance of continued investment and global cooperation in scientific research and healthcare infrastructure.As we look forward, let us hope that these hard-fought lessons will not only help us to mitigate the impact of viral diseases but also inspire further strides in the field of virology and beyond. After all, it is often our deadliest foes that push us to reach new heights.Also ReadClimate Crisis: 8 Shocking Realities of Climate ChangeADVERTISEMENTAdvertise with usHIVvirusAIDSInfluenzaEbolaZika virusCOVID-19polioSmallpoxpandemicADVERTISEMENTAdvertise with usMOST VIEWED STORIES1CryptocurrencyWazirX to launch a decentralised exchange and add new features to its existing platform2AnnouncementSupercharging developer work processes to drive digital innovation with Search AI 3NewsSridhar Vembu slams Freshworks layoffs; says cash-rich company can't expect employee loyalty if it prioritises shareholder buyback4NewsAwfis posts Rs 38.67 Cr profit in Q2 FY25 as revenue surges 40%5NewsUnicommerce to acquire ecommerce technology platform Shipway ADVERTISEMENTAdvertise with usADVERTISEMENTAdvertise with usBrandsThe CapTableHerStorySocial StoryEnterprise StoryThe Decrypting StoryYS LifeYS HindiYS TamilTopicspractomicrosoftolaswiggyzomatouberdelhiveryamazoncrednykaaResource HubGlossaryEverything AIHow-to’sknowledge baseOpinionUpcoming EventsTechSparks Bengaluru 2024DiscoverList Your StartupStartup SpotlightPitch To UsBrowse StartupsYS BuzzStart your day with impactful startup stories and concise news!

Hundreds of seabirds have been washed up on beaches on the South Pembrokeshire coast recently. The birds are being regularly removed, although more are being washed up between the clear-ups. Most are guillemots, although razorbills and gannets have also been reported. Testing has taken place on a sample of the dead birds, and Avian Influenza (bird flu) has this week been confirmed. A multi-agency response is in place to deal with the issue. Dead wild birds in public places should be reported by calling 01437 764551 (or out of hours 0345 601 5522) for Pembrokeshire County Council to arrange to collect safely. If you find any sick or injured wild birds (on public or private land), please contact the RSPCA on 0300 1234 999. Dead birds on private land should be reported to PCC on the numbers above for information gathering purposes but removal will be via DEFRA on 03459 33 55 77 or see https://www.gov.uk/guidanceeport-dead-wild-birds The organisations working together to deal with the issue are Pembrokeshire County Council, Pembrokeshire Coast National Park Authority, National Trust Cymru, Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales and Welsh Government. “Please do not handle any dead or sick birds if you come across them, and keep your dogs on leads,” said Cllr David Simpson, Leader of Pembrokeshire County Council. “Please have information to hand about where and when the bird or birds were discovered. Using a location finding app like what3words to record the location of the dead or sick bird(s) is also extremely helpful.” James Parkin, Director of Nature and Tourism at Pembrokeshire Coast National Park Authority said: “We are working with Pembrokeshire County Council and partner agencies to provide support across the county following reports of seabirds being washed up on Pembrokeshire’s beaches in the past week. “We anticipate an increase in the numbers of birds being washed ashore following the recent bad weather and we are urging people not to handle any dead or sick wild birds they may come across, to keep their dogs away, and to follow the advice provided in reporting any incidents.” Lisa Morgan from the Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales said: “It is really important that members of the public don’t touch dead or sick birds but also that they help us to understand the conservation impacts on our internationally important seabird populations by continuing to report any they might find.” A Welsh Government spokesperson said: “It is important that people do not pick up or touch any sick or dead wild birds and keep their dogs on leads to prevent them from also coming into contact. We would encourage the public to report any dead wild birds to DEFRA via their helpline or online form (03459 335577 or www.gov.uk/guidanceeport-dead-wild-birds ). Sick or injured birds should be reported to the RSPCA (0300 1234 999).” Rhian Sula, National Trust Cymru’s General Manager for Pembrokeshire added: “We are saddened by the discovery of dead birds across some of the beaches we care for in Pembrokeshire. “We know it's distressing for people to see sick and dead birds and will continue to work closely with partner organisations and government agencies to monitor the situation.” While no Avian Influenza Prevention Zone (AIPZ) is currently in place, Welsh Government advice is that bird keepers should to continue to complete the biosecurity self-assessment checklist. Scrupulous biosecurity is the most effective method of disease control available and all bird keepers should follow enhanced biosecurity measures at all times to prevent the risk of future outbreaks.

We are about halfway through Winter, and with Tasmanian schools returning next week, it is timely for a reminder of the actions we can all take to reduce the harms of respiratory infections. Every Winter, many respiratory infections circulate in the Tasmanian community. This year, COVID-19, influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are common. Director of Public Health, Dr Mark Veitch, encouraged Tasmanians to continue to prepare, plan and protect themselves and each other throughout the coming months. “Recent months have brought a substantial increase in several common respiratory infections,’’ he said. “Cases of COVID-19 in Tasmania have decreased recently, but cases of influenza and RSV have increased significantly. Influenza is affecting Tasmanians of all ages, with notifications highest among school-aged children, and younger children. Influenza will continue to circulate during Winter and early Spring. “I encourage all Tasmanians aged 6 months and older to get their annual flu vaccine, particularly those aged less than 5 years, those 65 years and older, pregnant women, those with medical conditions, and Aboriginal Tasmanians. “If you have not had a COVID-19 vaccine or illness this year, boosters are widely available at GPs and most local pharmacies. If you are at risk of severe illness, please plan with your GP about how you will get tested and access antiviral medication if you become sick. “People should also protect themselves and others by staying home if they are unwell, and keeping up simple behaviours like covering coughs and sneezes and washing hands. “Please consider wearing a mask in crowded indoor public spaces, particularly if you are at higher risk from respiratory infections, or if you have symptoms of respiratory infection. “As schools resume, and many Tasmanians return to workplaces, we should also remember the importance of staying away from school or work when you have a respiratory infection. This can help reduce the spread of infections in the community.” Department of Health Secretary and State Health Commander, Kathrine Morgan-Wicks, reminded Tasmanians that the successful COVID@homeplus program continues to provide high-quality virtual care to Tasmanians experiencing respiratory illnesses. “The COVID@homeplus team is there to support Tasmanians who test positive to COVID-19, as well as eligible Tasmanians who have symptoms of influenza and other respiratory infections who are at higher risk of severe illness,’’ she said. “This program has already supported more than 38,700 Tasmanians by providing them with virtual care to help manage their illness while they are in the comfort of their own home. This includes in situations where you are unable to quickly access your regular GP, with information on your treatment then being shared by the COVID@homeplus team with your GP.” The COVID@homeplus team can also help facilitate access to COVID-19, influenza and RSV PCR testing in certain circumstances for high-risk individuals, including children. Rapid antigen tests (RATs) for COVID-19 can also be accessed at pharmacies and by concession card holders through Service Tasmania centres. If you live in a rural or regional area and/or are unable to leave home (such as people with a disability), please contact the Public Health Hotline on 1800 671 738 to discuss options for accessing RATs. Testing is critical to ensure timely access for high-risk individuals to the correct anti-viral to manage the relevant respiratory illness and help prevent or reduce more severe consequences of the illness. Anyone with questions about COVID@homeplus in relation to COVID-19 or other respiratory illnesses can phone the team on 1800 973 663.

Five days later, he was dead.By Hayley TaylorThe final days before influenza claimed the life of an otherwise healthy Canberra father have been laid bare after the shock death plunged his wife and three sons into a period of “profound loss”.Mate Babic started to feel unwell earlier this month, but the 37-year-old died hours before his doctor’s appointment five days later.After first noticing symptoms on Friday, July 7, Mate made a TeleHeath call on the following Tuesday, a family friend and organiser of a GoFundMe supporting the family, Peta Harrison confirmed with 7NEWS.com.au.Know the news with the 7NEWS app: Download today The TeleHeath GP advised that Mate should book an in-person doctor’s appointment, which his wife Carla scheduled for the following day.Mate then went to his parent’s house and, after a feverish night, began to pour himself a bath.He laid down on a nearby bed while the bath filled, and then flooded the house, as he passed away in the early hours of Wednesday morning. Mate’s parents discovered him when they woke up.“His influenza had progressed to a bacterial pneumonia,” Harrison said.The one-word text teen sent before vanishing into bush2 min readDrastic move after Queensland girl’s death from flu2 min readCanberra father Mate Babic, 37, died of influenza B complications a week after he began feeling ill.

It would be absolutely devastating to lose it.“Our goal is to provide them with a financial safety net that will alleviate the immediate strain of funeral arrangement costs, household expenses, mortgage repayments, raising three boys on her own, and give them some breathing room to navigate this difficult time.”Donations to support the family can be made via the GoFundMe here.In the fortnight before Mate began feeling ill, there were 154 hospitalisations due to influenza across FluCAN sentinel hospital sites. Nine of those flu patients were admitted to ICU, according to the Department of Health Influenza Surveillance Report.In the ACT, between July 7 and 13, there were 96 influenza presentations from patients in Mate’s age group (20-64).Flu vaccinations across Australia between March and July 2023 have dropped almost 18 per cent compared with the same period in 2022, according to the Australian Immunisation Register, prompting national calls for vaccinations.- With AAPMum’s warning as newborn’s lungs collapse from common virus3 min readWoman discovers she has Down syndrome aged 23 but people refuse to believe her2 min readPlay VideoThe devastated family hopes their story will encourage others to get vaccinated.The devastated family hopes their story will encourage others to get vaccinated.The devastated family hopes their story will encourage others to get vaccinated.Stream free onACT NewsHealth & WellbeingPublic HealthTop HeadlinesMajor update after 71 cows found dead or dying at research facility 1 min readWoman dies in horrific crash on NSW road0 min read'Got her': Jury watches confronting moment cop fires taser at 95-year-old woman1 min readNSW town rocked by 4.1 magnitude earthquake0 min readKindergarten teacher’s family speaks out following her heroic death3 min readTraffic chaos as truck fire on major Melbourne freeway closes several lanes1 min readTwo people fighting for life after stolen car crashes on Victorian highway 0 min readAirfares rise after Rex collapses with some fares almost doubling2 min readTop HeadlinesMajor update after 71 cows found dead or dying at research facility 1 min readWoman dies in horrific crash on NSW road0 min read'Got her': Jury watches confronting moment cop fires taser at 95-year-old woman1 min readNSW town rocked by 4.1 magnitude earthquake0 min readKindergarten teacher’s family speaks out following her heroic death3 min readTraffic chaos as truck fire on major Melbourne freeway closes several lanes1 min readTwo people fighting for life after stolen car crashes on Victorian highway 0 min readAirfares rise after Rex collapses with some fares almost doubling2 min readOur Network7plus7BravoSunriseThe Morning ShowSpotlight7TWO7mate7Sport7RegionalThe NightlyThe West AustralianPerthNowTV GuideCoupons7MerchandiseOur PartnersView.com.auHealthengineHuddle InsuranceCarExpertRaiz InvestInstitchuStarts at 60IseekplantMadpawsWilled7NEWS AppStay informed with the free 7NEWS app. Available on iOS & Android.NewslettersBreaking NewsMorning EditionSports WrapConsumer AffairsLifestyleConnect With UsAbout UsContact UsAdvertise With UsFAQsPrivacy PolicyEditorial PolicyTerms & ConditionsFollow 7NEWS on FacebookFollow 7NEWS on InstagramEmail 7NEWSWatch 7NEWS on YouTubeFollow 7NEWS on TikTokFollow 7NEWS on TwitterFree flu jabs for all QueenslandersWatch TVNewsSportLifestyleTravelEntertainmentProduct ReviewsCouponsStanDomainDriveConnect with us Search NationalNSWVICQLDSAWAACTTASNTLatestUS Election 2024Israel-HamasCrimeTechnologyHealthFinanceExplainersCost of LivingPoliticsWorldAsiaEuropeNZUKUSAChinaAfricaVideosLiveToday ShowACA60 MinutesSportOlympicsAFLCricketFootballLive scoresNRLWeatherFinanceBusiness newsFind and comparePersonal financeSmall businessCelebrityEntertainment newsCelebrityRoyal newsTV guideAppApp StoreGoogle PlayMeet The TeamAbout 9NewsContact usMeet the teamPrivacyTerms of useYour location:SYDNEYSYDNEY, NSWPERTH, WAMELBOURNE, VICHOBART, TASBRISBANE, QLDDARWIN, NTADELAIDE, SACANBERRA, ACTYour web browser is no longer supported.

The seven-year-old now stuffs his father's jumper and tracksuit pants with a pillow, and sits it up next to him on the couch, with a controller on the lap, so he can still play with "daddy"."[Marko] is not doing so well, he's struggling," Mate's wife Carla Babic said. Her husband died on July 12. He was a hard-working father of three who was going through a health kick before he caught the virus. He stopped drinking alcohol, ate fruits and salad, and even signed up to a gym."He was healthy ... he was in the best shape and the fittest I'd seen him in a long time," Mrs Babic said. The Babic family pictured here together about one year ago. Mate and Carla Babic with their sons Luka, 3, Marko, 7, and Sebastian, 6. Picture suppliedHis untimely death has left her heartbroken. Mrs Babic said their family is "absolutely devastated". "I never in my wildest dreams thought that I'd be telling people I'm a widow, at 37," she said.Mr Babic was a big fan of the Canberra Raiders and the Brooklyn Nets. He had a "big personality" and loved making people laugh.She broke down when she described him as a "very involved" and "fun-loving" father. "Now my kids won't have a male role model in their lives anymore," she said.Mate Babic with his sister Matina Babic, mother Ana Babic, and father Marko Babic along with his youngest son, Luka. Picture suppliedMr Babic had had a cough for a few days, but "totally crashed" on Saturday, July 8. His wife and sons had fallen sick at the beginning of the school holidays. He was the last to fall ill.Mrs Babic said her husband had been at his parents' since Saturday. She said he did not want to go to the hospital because of previous experiences with long wait times.On Tuesday, Mr Babic was bedridden and had trouble talking. When he told his wife he wasn't doing well, she arranged a telehealth appointment for him.Mrs Babic said the doctor was "apprehensive" about prescribing medication and told her husband he needed to come in person. She then booked him a midday consult for the following day. In the early hours of Wednesday, Mr Babic woke up and drew a bath to soothe his aches. The water ran as he laid down to rest. Soon, the neighbours were banging on his parents' door. Their apartment had flooded and they discovered their son had died. The coroner's report revealed he died of bacterial pneumonia.The Babic family pictured here on holiday, in Pambula in January 2023. Picture suppliedMr and Mrs Babic had been getting their flu shots every year until this year. She now feels her husband should've gone to the hospital."He probably just kept thinking 'Tomorrow is going to be a better day'," she said. "It's not worth waiting and hoping when it can so quickly turn catastrophic."You keep replaying in your head - what if he would have just gone to the doctor, what if he had just had the flu vaccine?"READ ALSO:Govt abandons plans for elective surgery centre at UC hospitalMeasles alert after case visits airport and shopsI felt like a freak: Teen's struggle to find anorexia treatmentThe Babic family now finds themselves in financial peril. Mr Babic worked for Canberra Health Services doing shiftwork and had not collected much superannuation. He wanted to get life insurance but had been too busy to get around to it. He also spent every free moment building his family's home as well as renovating his parents'. "He built it to set us up for the future. It's his legacy and now we might have to potentially sell it," Mrs Babic said.She added the cost of living had made their situation harder and she was struggling to repay their mortgage."We weren't prepared enough for this," she said. "All for something that could have just been so easily prevented."Friends of the Babics have now started a GoFundMe page to raise funds in hopes of supporting the family through this challenging time.ShareFacebookTwitterWhatsappEmailCopyBageshri SavyasachiJournalistI am the police reporter for The Canberra Times.
