However, viral mutants that escape broadly neutralizing antibodies have been reported2,3. The identification of broadly neutralizing antibody classes that can neutralize viral escape mutants is critical for universal influenza virus vaccine design. Here we report a distinct class of broadly neutralizing antibodies that target a discrete membrane-proximal anchor epitope of the haemagglutinin stalk domain. Anchor epitope-targeting antibodies are broadly neutralizing across H1 viruses and can cross-react with H2 and H5 viruses that are a pandemic threat. Antibodies that target this anchor epitope utilize a highly restricted repertoire, which encodes two public binding motifs that make extensive contacts with conserved residues in the fusion peptide. Moreover, anchor epitope-targeting B cells are common in the human memory B cell repertoire and were recalled in humans by an oil-in-water adjuvanted chimeric haemagglutinin vaccine4,5, which is a potential universal influenza virus vaccine. To maximize protection against seasonal and pandemic influenza viruses, vaccines should aim to boost this previously untapped source of broadly neutralizing antibodies that are widespread in the human memory B cell pool.

However, most HA-binding antibodies target variable epitopes of the HA head domain, which provide limited protection against antigenically similar influenza virus strains3. Vaccine formulations that preferentially induce antibodies to conserved epitopes of the HA head and stalk domains could provide broad and potent protection against a wide array of influenza viruses. Several leading universal influenza virus candidates are designed to induce antibodies specifically to the stalk domain, but the spectrum of distinct epitopes on the stalk targeted by the human B cell repertoire remains to be determined. By analysing the specificities of B cells targeting the H1 stalk through the generation of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), our study reveals a new class of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) to an underappreciated epitope where HA anchors itself into the viral membrane. Next-generation vaccine platforms should take advantage of this finding to elicit antibodies to the conserved anchor epitope.Discovery of anchor epitope-binding mAbsTo investigate the specificities of HA-specific antibodies, we generated 358 mAbs from plasmablasts and HA+ memory B cells (MBCs) isolated from volunteers who were vaccinated against or naturally infected with seasonal influenza viruses or were participants in a phase I clinical trial of a chimeric HA (cHA) vaccine4,5. Of all mAbs tested, nearly half targeted the HA stalk domain, 21% of which targeted the well-characterized central stalk (CS) epitope (Extended Data Fig. 1a). Notably, stalk-binding mAbs were disproportionally isolated from the infected, 2009 pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) monovalent inactivated influenza vaccine, and the cHA vaccine cohorts (Extended Data Fig. 1b), as these exposure routes have previously been shown to induce antibody responses to the HA stalk5,8,9. To investigate which epitopes the remaining 79% of stalk-binding mAbs were targeting, we performed negative-stain electron microscopy with three non-CR9114 (ref. 10) competing stalk domain-binding mAbs: 047-09 4F04, 241 IgA 2F04 and 222-1C06. All three mAbs bound an epitope near the anchor of the HA stalk and were oriented at an upward angle towards the epitope (Fig. 1a, b, Extended Data Fig. 1c), suggesting that this epitope may be partially obstructed by the lipid membrane and may only be exposed for antibody binding as the HA trimers flex on the membrane. FISW84, a recently identified stalk-binding mAb11, targets an epitope that overlaps with the three identified anchor-binding mAbs (Extended Data Fig. 1d), suggesting that the anchor epitope is a common stalk epitope. Moreover, a proximal epitope was previously identified on group 2 viruses that is targeted by mAbs CR8020 (ref. 12) and CR8043 (ref. 13). Despite some overlap, the epitope targeted by the group 2 mAbs was considerably farther up and to the right on the HA stalk relative to the anchor epitope, and mAbs CR8020 and CR8043 targeted the stalk from above (Extended Data Fig. 1e, f), at an angle and positioning more akin to antibodies targeting the CS epitope. mAbs binding the CS epitope (CR9114 (ref. 10) and FI6v3 (ref. 14)) did not have overlapping footprints or compete for HA binding with the anchor-binding 047-09 4F04 mAb in an HA competition assay (Fig. 1c, d). In total, we identified 50 distinct mAbs that competed for binding to the anchor epitope from a total of 21 individuals (Fig. 1d, Extended Data Tables 1, 2). Of these, 34 anchor-binding mAbs from 15 donors were isolated from the cHA vaccine trial (Extended Data Tables 1, 2).Fig. 1: The anchor epitope is a common target of stalk-binding antibodies.a, Negative-stain EM of representative 2D class averages and 3D reconstructions of Fabs binding to A/California/7/2009 (E376K) HA. 047-09 4F04 was imaged at ×52,000 normal magnification and 222-1C06 and 241 IgA 2F04 were imaged at ×62,000 normal magnification. b, Juxtaposed 3D reconstructions of Fabs binding to A/California/7/2009 (E376K) HA. c, Binding footprints of anchor-binding Fabs relative to mAbs targeting the CS epitope (CR9114 and FI6v3). d, Competition of stalk-binding mAbs with CR9114 or 047-09 4F04 (bold mAbs). e, Neutralization potency of anchor-binding (n = 50) and CS-binding (n = 37) mAbs to A/California/7/2009.

See also Extended Data Figs. 1–3.Source dataFull size imageAnchor-binding mAbs were broadly reactive and broadly neutralizing to pre-pandemic and post-pandemic H1N1 viruses and a swine-origin H1N2 virus (Fig. 1e, Extended Data Fig. 1g, h). Notably, anchor-binding mAbs had similar neutralizing potency to pH1N1 relative to mAbs to the CS epitope (Fig. 1e, Extended Data Fig. 1i, j). Many stalk-targeting antibodies mediate protection via Fc-mediated functions, including antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity15,16. Anchor epitope-binding mAbs largely did not possess antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity activity (15 out of 18; Extended Data Fig. 1k–l), potentially due to the upward angle of approach of anchor-binding antibodies, which may position the Fc distantly from effector cells. Despite pan-H1 binding, anchor-targeting mAbs rarely cross-reacted with other HA subtypes tested, including H3, a group 2 subtype, other group 1 subtypes, including H2 and H5, and influenza B viruses (Fig. 1f, Extended Data Fig. 2a). Despite this, the 222-1C06 mAb cross-reacted with H2 and H5 HA (Fig. 1g, Extended Data Fig. 2b) and several anchor-binding antibodies could neutralize an H2N2 virus (Extended Data Fig. 2c), suggesting that antibodies targeting the anchor epitope can cross-neutralize other group 1 influenza A viruses. We recently demonstrated that bnAbs to the HA stalk are often polyreactive17, which may limit the activation of B cells expressing bnAbs. Relative to mAbs that target the CS epitope, we identified that anchor-binding mAbs were proportionally less likely to be polyreactive and those that were polyreactive had weaker relative affinity for lipopolysaccharide (Extended Data Fig. 2d, e). These data suggest that, although polyreactivity is selected for within the anti-anchor epitope B cell pool, it is not to the same level as B cells to the CS epitope.H1N1 viruses have acquired several mutations within the HA stalk domain, probably due to antibody selective pressures or to increase stability. To understand whether these mutations affect antibody binding to the anchor epitope, we screened mAbs against naturally occurring and experimentally identified viral escape mutants of mAbs binding to the CS epitope (Extended Data Fig. 2f, g, Extended Data Table 3). Anchor epitope-binding mAbs were mostly unaffected by these mutants, whereas most of the CS-binding mAbs showed reduced binding to at least one mutant (Extended Data Fig. 2g). Notably, most mAbs had reduced binding to A373V of HA2, which has recently been shown to preferentially grow in the presence of mAbs to the CS epitope2. While A373 is distant from the anchor epitope, the A373V mutation has been shown to affect the conformation of the HA stalk2, explaining the broad reduction of HA binding by antibodies targeting either stalk epitope. Anchor-binding mAbs only demonstrated a 10–30% reduction in binding (Extended Data Fig. 2g), indicating that they are still likely to neutralize viruses carrying the A373V mutation.To test whether mAbs targeting the anchor epitope were protective in vivo, we administered a cocktail of five mAbs targeting the anchor epitope or the CS epitope prophylactically and therapeutically (48 h after infection) to mimic a polyclonal response against these epitopes and infected mice with a lethal dose of a mouse-adapted pH1N1 virus (A/Netherlands/602/2009; Supplementary Table 1). Mice that received a prophylactic or therapeutic anti-anchor cocktail at 5 mg/kg experienced 100% protection from weight loss and lethal infection (Extended Data Fig. 3a, b). No differences in lung viral titres were detected in mice that received the anti-anchor cocktail prophylactically relative to mice administered the negative control mAb (Extended Data Fig. 3c). Anti-stalk antibodies do not provide sterilizing immunity but are known to neutralize subsequent rounds and limit disease progression18. As a result, lung viral titres do not necessarily reflect protection from morbidity and mortality. Finally, the anti-anchor cocktail given prophylactically provided 70% protection against lethal A/Fort Monmouth/1/1947 infection (Extended Data Fig. 3d), a virus that circulated before the birth of any of the donors in our study (Extended Data Table 1). Since anchor-binding mAbs do not engage in antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity for the most part, antibodies that target the anchor epitope probably provide protection in vivo through direct neutralization of the virus. Together, these data indicate that antibodies to the anchor epitope are pan-H1 neutralizing and protective in vivo.Structure of an anchor-binding antibodyAll anchor epitope-binding mAbs utilized one of four VH3 genes: VH3-23, VH3-30 or VH3-30-3, and VH3-48, in contrast to mAbs targeting the CS epitope, which commonly use VH1-69 (Fig. 2a, Extended Data Fig. 4a, b). Anchor epitope-binding mAbs also utilized a highly restricted light chain repertoire, with all mAbs utilizing a combination of VK3-11 or VK3-15 combined with JK4 or JK5 (Fig. 2b, Extended Data Fig. 4c, d). Furthermore, all but one light chain of the anchor-targeting mAbs were clonally related (Extended Data Table 2), indicating that the light chains were very similar across mAbs and study participants. We identified four distinct clonal expansions, with one public clone found across two donors (Extended Data Fig. 4e, f, Extended Data Table 2). Anchor epitope-targeting and CS-targeting mAbs exhibited similar levels of somatic hypermutations (Extended Data Fig. 4g). The κ-chain complementarity-determining region 3 (K-CDR3) length of anchor epitope-binding mAbs was highly restricted, with all K-CDR3s being ten amino acids long (Extended Data Fig. 4h).Fig. 2: Anchor-targeting mAbs bind to the HA fusion peptide via public binding motifs.a, b, VH (a) and VK (b) gene usage by anchor-binding mAbs.

Bold residues are contacts conserved with A/California/7/2009 H1N1 (k). The strain information used for conservation models in j and k are in Supplementary Tables 4, 5, respectively. See also Extended Data Fig. 4.Source dataFull size imageTo investigate the binding motif of anchor-targeting mAbs, we generated a high-resolution (3.38 Å) cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of 222-1C06 bound to A/California/7/2009 HA (Fig. 2c, Extended Data Fig. 4i–k). The broad paratope of 222-1C06 made extensive contacts across the HA fusion peptide19 (Fig. 2d, e), which mediates viral membrane fusion with the host membrane. Binding of the fusion peptide was largely mediated by an NWP motif within the K-CDR3, a Y58 directly following the H-CDR2, and a W99 in the H-CDR3, with these HA-binding motifs acting independently and in combination via an aromatic pocket (Fig. 2f, g, Supplementary Table 2). Moreover, both the K-CDR3 NWP and the H-CDR2 Y58 were found in all the anchor-binding mAbs and were germline encoded (Fig. 2h, i), which could have led to the selection of B cells utilizing these variable genes. Notably, FISW84 utilizes VH3-23 and VK3-15, and comparison of the paratopes showed that the NWP and Y58 motifs of FISW84 similarly form an aromatic pocket but orient towards the fusion peptide slightly differently than 222-1C06 (Extended Data Fig. 4l). Molecular dynamics simulations also showed that VH3-23-utilizing and VH3-30-utilizing mAbs from our study and FISW84 targeted the HA fusion peptide similarly to the cryo-EM structure of 222-1C06 via the aromatic pocket created by the K-CDR3 NWP and H-CDR2 Y58 motifs, albeit at different orientations (Extended Data Fig. 4m). Crucially, molecular dynamic and cryo-EM analyses revealed numerous intra-Fab interactions of hydrophobic and aromatic amino acids, including p-stacking of K-CDR3-P95 with K-CDR3-W94 and H-CDR2-Y58 that rigidified the paratope (Extended Data Fig. 4n, o, Supplementary Table 3).Broad analysis of human, swine and avian H1 viruses revealed that the side-chain contacts of 222-1C06 were highly conserved (94–100% conserved; Fig. 2j). In addition, the side-chain contacts were 100% conserved across 100 years of H1N1 virus evolution in humans (Extended Data Fig. 4p). Deep mutational scanning of potential H1 viruses at these contact residues indicated substantial permissibility (Extended Data Fig. 4q), although these mutations appear to not have been selected for in nature (Fig. 2j). The five side-chain contacts of this broad epitope were also highly conserved across group 1 viruses, with the W343 contact being 100% conserved across all group 1 viruses (Fig. 2k). Together, these data reveal that B cells targeting the anchor epitope utilized a highly restricted V(D)J gene repertoire, and the specific features within this repertoire made critical and extensive contacts with the conserved anchor epitope.The anchor epitope is a common targetOwing to the restricted repertoire features of anchor-targeting mAbs, we next determined the relative proportion of B cells with these features by interrogating single-cell repertoire sequencing of HA-specific B cells isolated from 20 human participants following cHA vaccination4,5. The cHA vaccine platform is intended to specifically induce antibodies to the stalk domain by retaining the stalk domain of H1 and replacing the head domain of HA with that of an avian subtype, either H8 (prime) or H5 (boost) for this trial4,5. To investigate the proportion of B cells with anchor epitope-binding repertoire features, we selected B cells that used VH3-23/VH3-30/VH3-30-3/VH3-48, VK3-11/VK3-15, JK4/JK5, a K-CDR3 ten amino acids in length, and possessed an NWP motif within the K-CDR3. We also segregated B cells expressing VH1-69 and a κ-chain, which are commonly used by B cells that target the CS epitope. We identified that B cells with features of antibodies binding the anchor epitope were abundant within the human B cell repertoire, with 6% of all B cells identified fitting within this defined repertoire (Fig. 3a). Moreover, all but one participant had at least one B cell with anchor-binding repertoire features (Fig. 3b). In addition, 32 out of 33 mAbs generated from the selected anchor-targeting B cell list competed for HA binding with 047-09 4F04 (Extended Data Fig. 5a), indicating that this population was greatly enriched for anchor-targeting B cells. Moreover, the anchor-binding B cells were highly mutated and were largely class-switched to IgG1 (Extended Data Fig. 5b, c), suggesting that these B cells were MBCs that had undergone affinity maturation and class-switch recombination. Together, these data indicate that the anchor epitope is a common target of the human MBC repertoire following cHA vaccination.Fig. 3: MBCs and serum antibodies commonly target the anchor epitope.a, Proportion of all cH5/1+ B cells with repertoire features of anchor-binding mAbs, VH1-69/κ (CS epitope) or with other repertoire features.

See also Extended Data Fig. 5.Source dataFull size imageTo confirm that anchor epitope-targeting mAbs were representative of the serum antibody response, we performed electron microscopy polyclonal epitope mapping (EMPEM)20 with serum antibodies from participants 236 and 241 from the 2014 quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine cohort (Extended Data Table 1). Both participants had detectable antibodies targeting the anchor epitope at days 7 and 14 post-vaccination (Fig. 3c, Extended Data Fig. 5d, e). Comparison of anchor epitope-binding polyclonal antibodies identified in participant 241 revealed that the 241 IgA 2F04 mAb strongly overlapped with the 241 polyclonal antibody (Fig. 3d), suggesting that the polyclonal antibody derived from this clonal expansion. Together, these data indicate that humoral immunity against the anchor epitope is common within the MBC pool and polyclonal serum antibody response after vaccination.cHA induces anchor-binding antibodiesTo investigate whether participants enrolled in a phase I clinical trial of the cHA vaccine (Fig. 4a) mounted an antibody response to the anchor and the CS epitope, we adapted the competition ELISA to detect serum antibody responses that could compete for binding with 047-09 4F04 and CR9114, respectively. Three different vaccine formulations were used in this trial, with participants being primed with either a cH8/1 inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) with an oil-in-water adjuvant (AS03) or a cH8/1 live-attenuated influenza vaccine followed by a boost with a cH5/1 IIV with or without AS03 (Fig. 4a). Only participants who received the IIV + AS03 on either the prime or boost were capable of seroconverting against both the anchor and the CS epitopes (Fig. 4b, c, Extended Data Fig. 6a, b). Participants who received the cH8/1 IIV + AS03 prime did not further increase serum antibodies to either stalk epitope after the cH5/1 + AS03 boost (Fig. 4c), suggesting that these B cells were refractory to continued activation. Serum titres against the anchor and CS epitopes (Extended Data Fig. 6a, b) closely matched that of serum neutralizing titres against a cH6/1N8 virus and an avian-swine H1N1 virus5, suggesting that the anchor-targeting and CS-targeting serum antibodies were responsible for neutralization.Fig. 4: cHA vaccination in humans robustly recalls MBCs targeting the anchor epitope.a, cHA vaccine trial design including vaccine groups (right; group 1 n = 10 participants; group 2 n = 7 participants; group 4 n = 7 participants; group 3 and 5 n = 6). i.m., intramuscular; i.n., intranasal; LAIV, live-attenuated influenza vaccine; PBS, phosphate buffered saline.

Individuals in the cHA (IIV + AS03) cohort were those who received the cHA vaccine with adjuvant (cH8/1 IIV + AS03 prime and cH5/1 IIV + AS03 boost; n = 17 donors) and the IIV cohort were those who received licensed IIV vaccines (2009 monovalent inactivated influenza vaccine, 2010 trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine and 2014 quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine; n = 11 donors). Data in b, c and e are mean ± s.d. The dotted line represents the limit of detection. Data in b and c were analysed by two-tailed non-parametric Kruskal–Wallis tests. Data in d were analysed by Fisher’s exact test. Data in e were analysed by two-tailed unpaired non-parametric Mann–Whitney test. See also Extended Data Fig. 6.Source dataFull size imageAll but one participant in the IIV + AS03 groups seroconverted against the anchor epitope (Fig. 4d) and had higher titres against the anchor epitope than participants who received the 2009 monovalent inactivated influenza vaccine or seasonal influenza virus vaccines (Fig. 4e). However, the precise role of the cHA immunogen versus the AS03 adjuvant in inducing anti-stalk antibody responses could not be resolved in our study. Notably, those individuals who received the IIV alone had weak plasmablast responses relative to those individuals who received the IIV + AS03 (ref. 4), suggesting that the oil-in-water adjuvant, not the cHA immunogen, was essential for robust activation of B cells and anti-anchor antibody responses. Moreover, considerable pre-existing antibodies may hinder recall of B cells to the stalk. Individuals first exposed to the 2009 pH1N1, a virus for which individuals had low pre-existing humoral immunity, had proportionally more isolated mAbs to the stalk and were more likely to have an anti-anchor mAb than individuals who had repeatedly been exposed to the pH1N1 virus in subsequent influenza seasons (Extended Data Fig. 6c, d), therefore suggesting that pre-existing antibodies may limit antibody responses to the HA stalk. Despite robust recall of antibodies to the anchor and CS epitopes by the adjuvanted vaccines, titres decreased 1 year after vaccination (day 420; Extended Data Fig. 6e, f). Together, these data indicate that the adjuvanted inactivated cHA vaccine can robustly induce antibodies to multiple stalk epitopes, including the anchor.Headless HA antigens, including mini-HA21, are attractive universal influenza virus vaccine antigens, as these antigens lack the immunodominant epitopes of the HA head21,22. However, only 1 out of 50 anchor-binding mAbs bound the mini-HA antigen21, whereas all anchor epitope-binding mAbs bound cH6/1 (Extended Data Fig. 6g). Compared to full-length HA, the membrane-proximal region of the mini-HA splays by approximately 14.5 Å (ref. 21), which may disrupt the antigenicity of the anchor epitope. To understand whether anchor epitope-targeting antibodies could bind to the mini-HA in a more native setting, we generated a membrane-bound mini-HA and observed that mAbs targeting the anchor and CS epitopes readily bind to both the full-length membrane-bound A/California/7/2009 HA and the membrane-bound mini-HA (Extended Data Fig. 6h), indicating that the mini-HA is antigenic when natively presented. Furthermore, we demonstrated that anchor epitope-targeting antibodies bound HA with a fibritin but not a GCN4 trimerization domain (Extended Data Fig. 6i), highlighting selection of the trimerization domain as an important factor for vaccine design. Together, these data demonstrate that native-like HA antigens, such as the cHA vaccine, can recall MBCs that target the anchor epitope.DiscussionIn this study, we identified a public class of bnAbs that target an epitope at the anchor of the HA stalk domain near the membrane. The anchor-targeting mAbs were public clonotypes across participants, with all antibodies possessing two conserved, germline-encoded binding motifs: a Y58 directly following the H-CDR2 and an NWP motif within the K-CDR3. The neutralizing activity of anchor epitope-targeting mAbs to pre-pH1N1 and post-pH1N1 viruses and a swine-origin H1-expressing virus indicates that the anchor epitope is an important target for pan-subtype neutralizing antibodies. As two of the last four influenza virus pandemics were caused by H1N1 viruses and a recent report has shown that antigenically novel H1-expressing viruses commonly spill over from swine into humans23, it is critically important to generate pan-H1 vaccines to prevent the next influenza pandemic. Moreover, the ability of anti-anchor antibodies to neutralize an H2 virus and the general conservation of contact residues suggests that anchor-targeting antibodies have the potential to acquire cross-neutralization against group 1 viruses.Our study highlights an additional broadly protective epitope of the HA stalk and provides guidance on how vaccines can be designed to drive broadly protective antibodies to multiple distinct epitopes, which can work cooperatively to provide optimal protection while avoiding the generation of antibody escape mutants. Notably, studies in the HIV-1 field have shown that bnAb monotherapy can lead to the develop-ment of antibody-resistant viral variants24,25,26, whereas combination bnAb therapy does not27. In addition, immune focusing towards a single epitope can lead to the generation and selection of viral escape mutants at these highly conserved epitopes2,3,28,29. Therefore, it is critical that future universal influenza virus vaccines elicit antibodies to multiple conserved epitopes to prevent the generation of bnAb escape viruses.The angle of approach of anchor-binding mAbs and the proximity of the epitope to the viral membrane suggest that this epitope is typically obstructed, limiting antibody recognition and B cell activation. However, membrane-bound HA typically flexes between 0° and 25° and up to 52° on its threefold axis11, suggesting antibodies and B cells can easily access the anchor epitope during this flexing process. Moreover, H1 viruses possess a highly conserved glycosylation site on the HA stalk that lies above the anchor epitope11,30, which may obstruct antibodies from targeting this epitope from above. Similarly, a neutralizing mAb to the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus targets an epitope on S2 from an upward angle to avoid glycans31. Therefore, the upward angle of approach may be a common feature of antibodies that recognize epitopes below glycans.Our study shows that humans have pre-existing immunity against the anchor epitope and influenza virus vaccination can recall MBCs to secrete antibodies to this epitope. However, vaccine HA antigens must have a native-like conformation near the transmembrane domain, as trimer splaying potentially due to the GCN4 trimerization domain ablates antibody binding to the anchor epitope. Moreover, our study reveals that the cHA vaccine strategy recalled MBCs to the anchor and CS epitopes, as these MBCs do not need to compete against MBCs that target the immunodominant variable HA head epitopes3,9,17,32. Similarly, the mini-HA/headless HA vaccine strategy has the potential to also recall MBCs to multiple epitopes of the HA stalk domain, if displayed natively22,33. The addition of an oil-in-water AS03 adjuvant to the cHA was critical for recalling MBCs to the anchor epitope. Oil-in-water adjuvants largely function to emulsify antigen, which may prevent sequestration of antigen by circulating antibodies, increase delivery of free antigen to lymph nodes, and help to stimulate innate immune receptors34,35. Notably, an oil-in-water adjuvanted inactivated H5N1 vaccine induced higher neutralizing antibody titres, antibodies to more HA epitopes, and higher avidity antibodies36. Therefore, the inclusion of oil-in-water adjuvants may have an important role in generating bnAbs and may improve vaccine effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccines. Together, our study shows that influenza vaccination strategies, such as the cHA vaccine with the AS03 adjuvant, have the capability to robustly induce antibodies to the previously underappreciated anchor epitope and can provide broad protection against H1 viruses.MethodsStudy approvals, cohorts and human materialsHuman peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and serum were obtained from multiple donors from multiple cohorts, which is outlined in Extended Data Table 1. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. All studies were performed with the approval of the University of Chicago Institutional Review Board (IRB; ID #09-043-A). The 2009 pH1N1 infection and 2009 monovalent inactivated influenza vaccine (MIV) cohorts were also approved by the IRB at Emory University. The chimeric HA vaccine study cohort is identified as clinical trial NCT03300050 and further details on trial design are outlined elsewhere4,5. The study was approved by IRBs at local clinical sites, including Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, Duke University, and Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center. All experiments performed with mice were done in accordance with the University of Chicago and Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees.Cell linesHuman embryonic kidney HEK293T (female, #CRL-11268), Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK; female, #CCL-34, NBL-2) and human A549 (#CCL-185) cells were purchased and authenticated by the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). MDCK-SIAT1 cells were generated previously37. All cells were maintained in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. HEK293T cells were maintained in advanced-DMEM supplemented with 2% ultra-low IgG fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen), 1% l-glutamine (Invitrogen) and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic (Invitrogen). MDCK, MDCK-SIAT1 and A549 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS (Invitrogen), 1% l-glutamine (Invitrogen) and 1% penicillin–streptomycin (Invitrogen). Jurkat cells expressing FcgRIIIa and FcgRI with a NFAT-driven luciferase reporter gene (#G7010) were acquired and validated by Promega and were directly used for antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) assays. Cell lines were not authenticated after receiving from suppliers and were not tested for mycoplasma.Monoclonal antibody productionMonoclonal antibodies were generated as previously described38,39,40. Peripheral blood was obtained from each donor approximately 7 days after vaccination or infection or obtained 28+ days post-vaccination. Lymphocytes were isolated and enriched for B cells using RosetteSep. Total plasmablasts (CD3−CD19+CD27hiCD38hi; all cohorts except 2014 quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (QIV)), IgG+ plasmablasts (CD3−CD19+IgM−CD27hiCD38hiIgG+IgA−; 2014 QIV), IgA+ plasmablasts (CD3−CD19+IgM−CD27hiCD38hiIgG−IgA+; 2014 QIV cohort), or HA+ bait-sorted MBCs (CD3−CD19+CD27+CD38lo/+HA+; for 030-09M 1B06) were single-cell sorted into 96-well plates. Genes encoding immunoglobulin heavy and light chains were amplified by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT–PCR), sequenced, cloned into human IgG1, human κ-chain, or human λ expression vectors, and co-transfected into HEK293T cells. Secreted mAbs were purified from the supernatant using protein A agarose beads. For mAbs generated from the 2014 QIV cohort, mAb names include the original isotype of the sorted plasmablast, and all mAbs were expressed as human IgG1. cH5/1-binding B cells (CD19+CD27+cH5/1+) were sorted from donors 28 days after cH5/1 vaccination (NCT03300050). Cells were sorted with A/California/04/2009 HA probe (for 030-09M 1B06) or cH5/1 probe, each with a Y98F mutation to ablate non-specific binding to sialic acids on B cells. mAb heavy chain and light chain sequences were synthesized from single-cell RNA sequencing data of cH5/1-baited B cells (IDT), and cloned into the human IgG1, human κ-chain or human λ expression vectors. B cell clones were determined by aligning all the V(D)J sequences sharing identical progenitor sequences, as predicted by IgBLAST using our in-house software, VGenes. Consensus sequence analysis was performed using WebLogo41 and sequence alignments were determined using Clustal Omega.Viruses and recombinant proteinsInfluenza viruses used in all assays were grown in-house in specific pathogen free (SPF) eggs, harvested, purified and titred. Recombinant HA, cHA and mini-HA were obtained from BEI Resources or generated in-house. Recombinant HA mutant proteins used in Extended Data Fig. 2 were generated with identified mutations from the deep mutational scanning experiments (see below) or with known mutations that have arisen naturally or were identified in other studies2,10,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52 (Extended Data Table 3). All mutations were made on HA from A/California/7/2009 and were expressed in HEK293T cells and purified using Ni-NTA agarose beads (Qiagen).Antigen-specific ELISAHigh protein-binding microtitre plates (Costar) were coated with 8 haemagglutination units (HAU) of virus in carbonate buffer or with recombinant HA, including HA mutants described below, at 2 μg ml−1 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) overnight at 4 °C. Plates were washed the next morning with PBS 0.05% Tween and blocked with PBS containing 20% FBS for 1 h at 37 °C. Antibodies were then serially diluted 1:3 starting at 10 μg ml−1 and incubated for 1.5 h at 37 °C. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-human IgG antibody diluted 1:1,000 (Jackson Immuno Research) was used to detect binding of mAbs, and plates were subsequently developed with Super Aquablue ELISA substrate (eBiosciences). Absorbance was measured at 405 nm on a microplate spectrophotometer (Bio-Rad). To standardize the assays, control antibodies with known binding characteristics were included on each plate, and the plates were developed when the absorbance of the control reached 3.0 optical density (OD) units. All ELISAs were performed in duplicate twice. To define antibodies as targeting the H1 stalk, mAbs were tested for binding to cH5/1, which utilizes the head domain from H5-expressing viruses and the stalk domain from the pH1N1 virus53, and for haemagglutination inhibition (HAI) activity against pH1N1 (A/California/7/2009). mAbs that bound the cHA and lacked HAI activity were classified as those binding the HA stalk domain. To classify antigen specificity, mAbs that did not definitively bind to the HA head or stalk are listed as binding unknown HA+ epitopes. Affinity measurements, as represented as dissociation constant (Kd) at a molar concentration (M), were calculated using Prism 9 (GraphPad) by performing a non-linear regression. All experiments were performed in duplicate and technically replicated twice.Competition ELISAsPlates were coated with 50 µl of A/California/7/2009 HA at a concentration of 1 µg ml−1 and incubated overnight at 4 °C. To biotinylate the antibodies with known epitope specificities, CR9114 (CS epitope) and 047-09-4F04 (anchor epitope) were incubated at 4 °C with EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-Biotin (Thermo Scientific) for 24 h or 48 h before use, respectively. After blocking the plates with PBS containing 20% FBS for 1 h at 37 °C, serum samples were incubated (starting dilution of 1:50 for human serum or 20 μg ml−1 for mAbs) in the coated wells for 2 h at room temperature. Either biotinylated CR9114 or 047-09 4F04 was then added at a concentration equal to twice its Kd and incubated in the wells with the serum or mAbs for 2 h at room temperature. The biotin-ylated antibodies were desalted before addition to remove free biotin using Zeba spin desalting columns, 7 k MWCO (Thermo Scientific). After washing the plates, wells were incubated with HRP-conjugated streptavidin (Southern Biotech) at 37 °C for 1 h for detection of the biotin-ylated antibody. Super Aquablue ELISA substrate (eBiosciences) was then added, and absorbance was measured at 405 nm on a microplate spectrophotometer (Bio-Rad). To standardize the assays, biotinylated CR9114 or 047-09 4F04 was incubated in designated wells on each plate without any competing serum or mAb, and data were recorded when the absorbance of these wells reached an OD of 1–1.5 units. After subtracting background, percent competition by serum samples was then determined by dividing the observed OD of a sample by the OD reached by the positive control, subtracting this value from 1, and multiplying by 100. For the serum data, ODs were log transformed and analysed by non-linear regression to determine EC50 values using Prism software (GraphPad). For Fig. 4 and Extended Data Fig. 5, only donors with serum for all timepoints were included. All experiments were performed in duplicate and technically replicated twice.Polyreactive ELISAsHigh-protein binding microtitre plates (Costar) were coated with 10 μg ml−1 calf thymus double-stranded DNA (dsDNA; Thermo Fisher Scientific), 2 μg ml−1 Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium flagellin (Invitrogen), 5 μg ml−1 human insulin (Sigma-Aldrich), 10 μg ml−1 KLH (Invitrogen) and 10 μg ml−1 Escherichia coli LPS (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS. Plates were coated with 10 μg ml−1 cardiolipin in 100% ethanol and allowed to dry overnight. Plates were washed with water and blocked with PBS, 0.05% Tween and 1 mM EDTA. mAbs were diluted 1 μg ml−1 in PBS and serially diluted fourfold and added to plates for 1.5 h. Plates were washed and goat anti-human IgG-HRP (Jackson Immunoresearch) was diluted 1:2,000 in PBS, 0.05% Tween and 1 mM EDTA. Plates were washed with water and were blocked with PBS, 0.05% Tween and 1 mM EDTA for 5 min. Plates were washed again with water and were developed with Super Aquablue ELISA substrate (eBioscience) until the positive control mAb, 3H9 (ref. 54), reached an A450 of 3. All experiments were performed in duplicate and technically replicated twice.Deep mutational scanning for stalk domain mutantsThe mutant libraries used herein were previously described55. The libraries consist of all single amino acid mutations to A/WSN/1933 (H1N1). The experiments were performed by using biological triplicate libraries. The mutational antigenic profiling of 045-09 2B06, a CS epitope-binding mAb, was performed as previously outlined56. In brief, 106 tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID50) of two of the virus library biological replicates was diluted in 1 ml in IGM (Opti-MEM supplemented with 0.01% FBS, 0.3% BSA and 100 mg ml−1 calcium chloride) and incubated with an equal volume of 045-09 2B06 antibody at a final concentration of 50 or 25 μg ml−1 for 1.5 h at 37 °C. MDCK-SIAT1 cells were infected with the virus antibody mixtures. Two hours post-infection, the media were removed, the cells washed with 1 ml PBS, and 2 ml of fresh IGM was added. Fifteen hours post-infection, viral RNA was extracted, reverse-transcribed using primers WSNHA-For (5′-AGCAAAAGCAGGGGAAAATAAAAACAAC-3′) and WSNHA-Rev (5′-AGTAGAAACAAGGGTGTTTTTCCTTATATTTCTG-3′), and PCR amplified according to the barcoded-subamplicon library preparation as previously described55. The overall fraction of virions that survive antibody neutralization was estimated using quantitative RT–PCR (qRT–PCR) targeting the viral nucleoprotein (NP) and cellular GAPDH as previously described56. Using tenfold serial dilutions of the virus libraries, we infected cells with no antibody selection to serve as a standard curve of infectivity. qPCR Ct values from the standard curve samples compared to the virus–antibody mix samples were determined for NP and GAPDH. We then generated a linear regression to fit the difference between the NP and GAPDH Ct values for the standard curve samples, and then used this curve to interpolate the fraction surviving for the antibody–virus selection samples. Across the three library replicates, the fraction of virus surviving antibody selection was 0.17, 0.1 and 0.14.Illumina(R) deep sequencing data were analysed using dms_tools2 version 2.4.12 software package57, which can be found at https://github.com/jbloomlab/dms_tools2. The computer code used is at https://github.com/jbloomlab/2B06_DMS, and the Jupyter notebook that performed most of the analysis is at https://github.com/jbloomlab/2B06_DMS/blob/master/analysis_notebook.ipynb. The sequencing counts were processed to estimate the differential selection for each mutation, which is the log enrichment of that mutation in the antibody-selected condition versus the control56. The numerical measurements of the differential selection that 2B06 imposes on each mutation can be found at: https://github.com/jbloomlab/2B06_DMS/blob/masteresults/diffselidy_diffsel.csv.Deep mutational scanning for H1 variantsAmino acid preferences for the HA of A/WSN/1933 (H1N1) were previously determined55. In brief, deep mutational scanning was performed by passaging virus libraries at a low multiplicity of infection in MDCK-SIAT1 cells. Following deep sequencing of the resulting virus, amino acid preferences were determined using the Python package dms_tools (http://jbloomlab.github.io/dms_tools/), version 1.1.12. This program aligns subamplicon reads to the reference HA sequence, counts the number of mutations at each amino acid site, and determines amino acid preferences based on the mutation counts pre-selection and post-selection.Microneutralization assaysMicroneutralization assays for mAb characterization were carried out as previously described58,59. MDCK cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin–streptomycin, and 1% l-glutamine at 37 °C with 5% CO2. The day before the experiment, 25,000 MDCK cells were added to each well of a 96-well plate. Serial twofold dilutions of mAb were mixed with an equal volume of 100 TCID50 of virus for 1 h and added to MDCK cells for 1 h at 37 °C. The mixture was removed, and cells were cultured for 20 h at 37 °C with 1X MEM supplemented with 1 μg ml−1 tosyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin and appropriate mAb concentration. Cells were washed twice with PBS, fixed with 80% ice-cold acetone at −20 °C for at least 1 h, washed three times with PBS, blocked for 30 min with 3% BSA–PBS, and then treated for 30 min with 2% H2O2. Cells were incubated with a mouse anti-NP antibody (1:1,000; Millipore) in 3% BSA–PBS for 1 h at room temperature, followed by goat anti-mouse IgG HRP (1:1,000; Southern Biotech) in 3% BSA–PBS for 1 h at room temperature. The plates were developed with Super Aquablue ELISA substrate at 405 nm until virus-only controls reached an OD of 1. The signal from uninfected wells was averaged to represent 100% inhibition. The signal from infected wells without mAb was averaged to represent 0% inhibition. Duplication wells were used to calculate the mean and s.d. of neutralization, and the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) was determined by a sigmoidal dose–response curve. The inhibition ratio (%) was calculated as: ((OD positive control – OD sample)/(OD positive control – OD negative control)) × 100. The final IC50 was determined using Prism software (GraphPad). All experiments were performed in duplicate and technically replicated twice.H2N2 neutralization assaysTwenty thousand MDCK cells were seeded per well in a 96-well cell culture plate (Corning) and the cells were used the next morning to perform the neutralization assay. Antibody dilutions were prepared starting at 30 μg ml−1 with threefold subsequent dilutions in 1X MEM. Each respective dilution was mixed with 10,000 plaque-forming units (PFU) of cold-adapted A/Ann Arbor/6/1960 (H2N2) virus for 1 h at room temperature. After 1 h, cells were washed with PBS and 100 μl of antibody–virus mixture was added onto the cells for 1 h at 37 °C. Next, the antibody–virus mixture was removed and 60 μl of 1X MEM containing TPCK was added to each well. Of each corresponding antibody dilution, 60 μl was also added to each well and the cells were incubated at 33 °C for 3 days. On the third day, a haemagglutination assay was performed using turkey red blood cells to assess the HAU at each antibody dilution.In vivo challenge infectionsmAb cocktails (Extended Data Fig. 2b) were passively transferred into 6–8-week-old female BALB/c mice (Jackson Laboratories) by intraperitoneal injection of 0.2, 1 and 5 mg per kg mAb cocktail, which are further detailed in Supplementary Table 1. Negative control mice received 5 mg per kg of the anthrax-specific mAb 003-15D03 as an isotype control. mAbs were administered 2 h before infection for prophylactic treatment and 48 h post-infection for therapeutic treatment. For prophylactic mAb studies with A/Netherlands/602/2009 (Extended Data Fig. 3a), mice were anaesthetized with isoflurane and intranasally challenged with 10 lethal dose 50 (LD50) of mouse-adapted A/Netherlands/602/2009 H1N1 virus, with 10 μl of virus administered into each nostril (20 μl total). For therapeutic treatment of A/Netherlands/602/2009 and prophylactic treatment of A/Fort Monmouth/1/1947, mice were anaesthetized with a ketamine–xylazine–water cocktail (0.15 mg ketamine per kg and 0.03 mg per kg xylazine; 100 ml intraperitoneally) and infected with 10 LD50 of A/Netherlands/602/2009 or A/Fort Monmouth/1/1947. As a read out, survival and weight loss were monitored 1–2 times daily for 2 weeks. Mice wereeuthanized upon 25% weight loss or at the end of the experiment (14 days post-challenge). Five mice per condition per experiment with two biological replicates were utilized based on a previously performed power analysis. Data were pooled for analysis.To determine differences in lung viral load, 5 mg per kg of the antibody cocktails was administered prophylactically as described above. Two hours after mAb administration, mice (n = 5 mice per group) were anaesthetized and intranasally challenged with 1 LD50 of A/Netherlands/602/2009. Lungs were collected at day 3 and day 6 post-infection, homogenized and viral load was determined via plaque assay. All experiments were done in accordance with the University of Chicago and Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees. Animals studies were not blinded or randomized.Plaque assayFor determination of viral load in mouse lung tissues a standard plaque assay was performed. Confluent monolayers of MDCK cells were infected with serial dilutions of homogenized lung tissue ranging from 1:10 to 1:1,000,000 diluted in 1X MEM (1% penicillin–streptomycin antibiotics mix, 1% HEPES, 1% l-glutamine and 1% sodium-bicarbonate (Gibco)) for 1 h at 33 °C, with shaking every 15 min. Afterwards, an overlay containing 2% Oxoid agar (Thermo Fisher), H2O, 2X MEM, DEAE and TPCK-treated trypsin was added to the cells. The plates were incubated at 33 °C for 3 days and then fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4 °C. Plaques were visualized by immunostaining. Here, the agar overlay was removed and the plates blocked with 3% milk and PBS. The blocking solution was removed and primary antibody ((H1N1 guinea pig anti-sera (generated in house)) diluted 1:3,000 in 1% milk and PBS was added for 1 h. The plates were washed three times with PBS and secondary antibody (anti-mouse IgG H&L peroxidase-conjugated (Rockland) diluted 1:3,000 in 1% milk and PBS was added for 1 h. The plates were washed three times with PBS and developed by using KPL TrueBlue Peroxidase Substrate (SeraCare).Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity reporter assayA549 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 10 U ml−1 penicillin, and 10 mg ml−1 streptomycin) and were plated in 96-well, white-walled plates (Costar) at 2.5 × 105 cells per ml overnight at 37 °C with 5% CO2. The following day, cells were washed with PBS and infected with A/Netherlands/602/2009 at a multiplicity of infection of 5 in UltraMDCK media (Lonza) for 24 h in the absence of TPCK-treated trypsin. mAbs were serially diluted in assay buffer (RPMI 1640 supplemented with 4% ultra-low IgG FBS; Gibco), starting at 60 μg ml−1 and diluted threefold. Cell medium was aspirated and 25 μl of assay buffer and 25 μl of diluted antibody were added to each well. Jurkat cells expressing human FcgRIIIa with a NFAT-driven luciferase reporter gene (Promega) were diluted to 3 × 106 cells per ml, 25 μl of cells was added to each well and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 6 h. Plates were removed from the incubator and placed at room temperature for 15 min. Of the BioGlo luciferase substrate (Promega), 75 μl was added to each well and luminescence was read immediately using a Syngery H1 hybrid multimode microplate reader (Biotek). EC50 values were determined using Prism 8 (GraphPad).HA–antibody binding footprint mappingThe footprints of three mAbs (FISW84 (PDB: 6HJQ), CR9114 (PDB: 4FQI) and FI6v3 (PDB: 3ZTN)) were mapped onto one HA protomer (A/California/4/2009, PDB: 4M4Y) using UCSF Chimera60 and Adobe Photoshop. Negative-stain EM maps of HA–Fab complexes were aligned in UCSF Chimera and estimated footprints were mapped onto one HA protomer. Individual protomers of the HA trimer are indicated in different shades of grey.Negative-stain EMImmune complexes were prepared by incubating Fab with HA (A/California/04/2009 with E376K or E376G stabilizing mutations) at greater than 3:1 molar ratio for 2 h at room temperature. Samples were deposited at approximately 10 μg ml−1 on glow-discharged, carbon-coated 400 mesh copper grids (Electron Microscopy Sciences) and stained with 2% w/v uranyl formate. Samples were imaged at ×52,000 magnification, 120 kV, on a Tecnai Spirit T12 microscope equipped with an Eagle CCD 4k camera (FEI) or ×62,000 magnification, 200 kV, on a Tecnai T20 microscope equipped with a CMOS 4k camera (TVIPS). Micrographs were collected with Leginon, single particles were processed with Appion, Relion and XQuartz, and footprints were mapped with UCSF Chimera, and figures were made with UCSF Chimera60,61,62,63.Cryo-EM222-1C06 and 045-09 2B05 Fabs were incubated at greater than 3:1 molar ratio with HA (A/California/7/2009, E376K) for 1 h at room temperature. 045-09 2B05 Fab, targeting the lateral patch, was added to the immune complex to induce particle tumbling and increase angular sampling3. Using a Thermo Fisher Vitrobot, the immune complex (0.5 mg ml−1) incubated with lauryl maltose neopentyl glycol (5 µM, Anatrace) was deposited onto glow-discharged Au 1.2/1.3 300 mesh grids (Electron Microscopy Sciences), blotted for 7 s, and plunge-frozen in liquid ethane. Samples were imaged at ×36,000 nominal magnification on a 200 kV Talos Arctica electron microscope (FEI) with a CETA 4k CMOS camera (FEI, total dose 49.92 e/Å2) and Gatan K2 Summit detector in counting mode. 2,243 micrographs were collected, aligned and CTF-corrected using Leginon, MotionCor2 in Appion, and Patch-CTF in CryoSPARC2, respectively61,62,64,65. In CryoSPARC2, particles were picked using apo HA templates, selected through reference-free 2D classification, and reconstructed through 3D classification and refinement. The final map resolved to a global 3.75 Å resolution with C3 symmetry and 44,224 particles. Figures were made in Prism 8 (GraphPad) and UCSF Chimera60.Model building and refinementA predicted model of 222-1C06 Fab was generated using abYsis (http://www.abysis.org/abysis/) and docked into EM density along with an initial model of CA09 H1 HA + 045-09 2B05 (PDB: 7MEM). The initial model was iteratively refined using COOT and Rosetta66,67. The final model was numbered using the H3 and Kabat numbering schemes. The final model and map were evaluated using MolProbity, EMRinger68,69, Phenix and the PDB validation server. After modelling the immune complex, we segmented the Fab density from HA in the cryo-EM map and mapped the footprint of the 222-1C06 model in the HA density. Cryo-EM data collection and refinement statistics are included in Extended Data Table 4.Electron microscopy polyclonal epitope mappingHuman serum samples were heat-inactivated at 55 °C for 30 min before incubating on Capture Select IgG-Fc (ms) Affinity Matrix (Fisher) to bind IgG at 4 °C for 72 h on a rotator. Samples with IgG bound to resin were centrifuged at 4,000 rpm and supernatant was collected. IgG samples were washed three times with PBS followed by centrifugation to remove supernatant. Samples were buffer exchanged into buffer containing 100 mM Tris, 2 mM EDTA and 10 mM l-cysteine through centrifugation with Amicon filters, then incubated with papain for 4 h at 37 °C, shaking at 80 rpm. The digestion reactions were quenched with 50 mM iodoacetamide, buffer exchanged to TBS and separated by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) with a Superdex 200 increase 10/300 column (GE Healthcare). Fab and undigested IgG were collected and concentrated, and 500 μg Fab was complexed with 10 μg HA for 18 h at room temperature. Reactions were purified by SEC and immune complexes were collected and concentrated. Negative-stain EM grids were prepared as described above.Membrane-bound HA and mAb stainingHEK293T cells were plated into a six-well plate and transfected overnight with 0.2 μg of plasmid and 10 μg ml−1 PEI. After 12–16 h, media were replaced with PFHM-II (Gibco) and cells were rested for 3 days. Transfected cells were trypsinized, washed and aliquoted. Cells were stained with 10 μg ml−1 of individual mAbs for 30 min. Cells were washed and stained with anti-human IgG Fc-BV421 for 30 min. Cells were washed two times and run on a BD LSRFortessa and collected with BD FACSDiva software. Data were analysed using FlowJo v10.Single-cell RNA sequencing and repertoire analysiscH5/1+ memory B cells (CD19+CD27+HA+) were bulk sorted and partitioned into nanolitre-scale gel bead-in-emulsions (GEMs) to achieve single-cell resolution using the 10x Genomics Chromium Controller and according to the manufacturer’s instruction (10x Genomics). The sorted single cells were processed according to 5′ gene expression and B cell immunoglobulin enrichment instruction to prepare the libraries for sequencing. Libraries were sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq 4000 at Northwestern University or an Illumina NextSeq 500 at the University of Chicago. Cellranger Single-Cell Software Suite (version 3.0) was used to perform sample demultiplexing, barcode processing, and single-cell 5′ and V(D)J counting, and Cellranger mkfastq was used to demultiplex raw base call (BCL) files into sample-specific fastq files. Subsequently, GRCh38-1.2.0 and cellranger-vdj-GRCh38-alta-ensembl-2.0.0 were used as references for the transcriptome and V(D)J assembly, respectively. Cellranger counts and Cellranger vdj package were used to identify gene expression and assemble V(D)J pairs of antibodies.Single-cell datasets were analysed using Seurat 3 toolkit (Version 3.2.0). We performed conventional pre-process steps for all 20 donors including cell quality control (QC), normalization, identification of highly variable features, data scaling and linear dimensional reduction. More specifically, we only kept cells with more than 200 and less then 2,500 detected genes for the QC step. We also filtered out cells with high mitochondrial gene expression using a ‘softThreshold’ function in the R package LinQ-View (version 0.99)70. We normalized the RNA data using conventional log normalization. We identified 2,000 highly variable genes for each dataset and performed principle component analysis (PCA) in linear dimensional reduction step. We then integrated all 20 single-cell datasets from vaccinated participants to remove batch effects using the Anchor method in Seurat 3. In this analysis, we filtered our dataset and only kept cells with both transcriptome and full length and paired heavy and light chain V(D)J sequences (n = 1,952). From these cells, we identified a group of ‘VH1-69/κ’ B cells that used the VH1-69 gene and κ-light chain, which is enriched for B cells targeting the BN stalk epitope. We also identified a group of ‘anchor epitope’-specific B cells by the following rules: (1) VH locus: VH3-23, VH3-30, VH3-30-3 or VH-3-48; (2) VK locus: VK3-11 or VK3-15; (3) JK locus: JK4 or JK5; (4) K-CDR3 length equal to 10; and (5) a ‘NWP’ pattern in the K-CDR3 peptide.HA conservation modellingPan-H1 conservation models are based on consensus strains (listed in Supplementary Table 4) of distinct H1 clades isolated from humans, swine and avian sources, as described in Zhuang et al.71 and inclusion of the Eurasian swine-like A/swine/Jiangsu/J004/2018 (ref. 23). To generate the group 1 HA conservation model, we selected one representative sequence for each group 1 HA subtype from FluDB (https://www.fludb.org/; Supplementary Table 5) according to a previous study72. A multiple sequence alignment from these HA protein sequences was generated using MUSCLE73 and the conservation of each residue was quantified using an entropy model41. Seasonal H1 conservation models are based on consensus strains of H1N1 viruses (59 strains total) circulating between 1918–1957 and 1976–2019, which was previously described3. Amino acid alignments and H3 numbering were performed using Librator74 and Burke and Smith HA numbering72.Structure predictionTo predict the structures of the investigated Fv fragments (222-1C06, FISW84, 241 IgA 2F04 and SFV009 3G01) with A/California/4/2009 E47G HA (PDB: 7MEM), we applied the program RosettaAntibody67,75,76. The Fvs were protonated using the Protonate 3D tool77,78. Charge neutrality was ensured by utilizing the uniform background plasma approach in AMBER79,80. Using the tleap tool of the AmberTools20 (ref. 81) package, the structure models were soaked in cubic water boxes of TIP3P water molecules with a minimum wall distance of 10 Å to the protein82. Parameters for all antibody models derive from the AMBER force field 14SB83. The Fvs were carefully equilibrated using a multistep equilibration protocol84.Metadynamics simulationsTo enhance the sampling of the conformational space, well-tempered bias-exchange metadynamics85,86,87 simulations were performed in GROMACS88,89 with the PLUMED 2 implementation90. We chose metadynamics as it enhances sampling on predefined collective variables. The sampling is accelerated by a history-dependent bias potential, which is constructed in the space of the collective variables85,86,91. As collective variables, we used a well-established protocol, boosting a linear combination of sine and cosine of the ψ torsion angles of all six CDR loops calculated with functions MATHEVAL and COMBINE implemented in PLUMED 2 (ref. 90). As discussed previously, the ψ torsion angle captures conformational transitions comprehensively92. The underlying method presented in this paper has been validated in various studies against a large number of experimental results93. The simulations were performed at 300 K in an NpT ensemble using the GPU implementation of the pmemd module94 to be as close to the experimental conditions as possible and to obtain the correct density distributions of both protein and water. We used a Gaussian height of 10.0 kJ mol−1 and a width of 0.3 rad. Gaussian deposition occurred every 1,000 steps and a biasfactor of 10 was used. 500 ns of bias-exchange metadynamics simulations were performed for the prepared Fv structures. The resulting trajectories were aligned to the whole Fv and clustered with the program cpptraj80,95 using the average linkage hierarchical clustering algorithm with a RMSD cut-off criterion of 1.2 Å resulting in a large number of clusters. The cluster representatives for the antibody fragments were equilibrated and simulated for 100 ns using the AMBER 20 (ref. 81) simulation package.Molecular dynamics simulationsMolecular dynamics simulations were performed in an NpT ensemble using the pmemd.cuda module of AMBER 20 (ref. 80). Bonds involving hydrogen atoms were restrained with the SHAKE algorithm96, allowing a time step of 2.0 fs. Atmospheric pressure (1 bar) of the system was set by weak coupling to an external bath using the Berendsen algorithm97. The Langevin thermostat98 was used to maintain the temperature during simulations at 300 K.With the obtained trajectories, we performed a time-lagged independent component analysis (tICA) using the Python library PyEMMA 2, using a lag time of 10 ns. tICA was applied to identify the slowest movements of the investigated Fab fragments and consequently to obtain a kinetic discretization of the sampled conformational space99. On the basis of the tICA conformational spaces, thermodynamics and kinetics were calculated with a Markov-state model100 of all six CDR loops by using PyEMMA 2. The resulting kinetically dominant ensemble in solution was further used to predict the interactions of H1 with the Fvs. To model the complex and to predict interactions in the binding interface, we used the crystal structure of the full-length influenza HA (PDB: 7MEM) as template structure. In addition, the obtained complex structure was further minimized and equilibrated.Statistical analysisAll statistical analyses were performed using Prism software (GraphPad versions 8 and 9) or R. Sample sizes (n) for the number of mAbs tested are indicated in corresponding figures or in the centre of pie graphs. The number of biological repeats for experiments and specific tests for statistical significance used are indicated in the corresponding figure legends. P values less than or equal to 0.05 were considered significant: *P ≤ 0.05, **P ≤ 0.01, ***P ≤ 0.001 and ****P < 0.0001.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this paper.

By José A. Álvarez, County of San Diego Communications OfficeDec. 22, 2021 | 11:00 AMDec. 23, 2021 | 11:01 AM Reading Time: 2 minutesThe number of influenza cases in the San Diego region continues to increase, week after week. The County Health and Human Services Agency is reporting 191 lab-confirmed influenza cases for the week ending Dec. 18, a 34% increase from the previous week when 143 flu infections were reported. “More influenza cases are expected for this time of the year since more people are getting together and they’re gathering indoors,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “Protect yourself and your loved ones. Get vaccinated now.” The County Health and Human Services Agency publishes the Influenza Watch weekly report, which tracks key flu indicators and summarizes influenza surveillance in the region. For the week ending Dec. 18, 2021, the report shows the following: Emergency department visits for influenza-like illness: 4% of all visits (compared with 4% the previous week) Lab-confirmed influenza cases for the week: 191 (compared to 143 the previous week) Total lab-confirmed cases to date: 862 (compared to 44 at the same time last season and a 961 prior 5-year average during the same week) Total influenza deaths to date: 0 (compared to 0 at this time last season) How to Prevent the Flu The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone 6 months and older get a flu shot every year. It takes about two weeks for immunity to develop. The CDC also indicates you can get a flu and COVID-19 vaccination at the same time, including a booster dose. The coronavirus vaccine does not work against influenza and vice versa. The flu vaccine is especially important for people at higher risk of having serious complications from the virus. They include: People with chronic medical conditions like asthma, diabetes, and lung disease, even if symptoms are under control Pregnant women People aged 65 years and older People who live with or care for others who are at higher risk The influenza vaccine is now available at doctors’ offices and retail pharmacies and is covered by medical insurance. People with no health care coverage can get vaccinated at one of the County’s six public health centers or a local community clinic. To find the nearest location, visit the County’s Flu Vaccine Locations page or call 2-1-1 San Diego. In addition to getting vaccinated, people should also do the following to avoid getting sick: Wash hands thoroughly and often Use hand sanitizers Stay away from sick people Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth Clean commonly touched surfaces If you are sick, stay home and avoid contact with others In 2020, a total of 848 influenza cases were reported in San Diego, including two deaths. In 2019, a total of 108 San Diegans died from influenza and more than 20,700 flu cases were reported. Related: fluflu vaccinationsinfluenzainfluenza vaccine José A.

Donate and DOUBLE your impact We celebrate the anniversary of the first COVID-19 vaccines this winter—and progress in controlling the virus. With vaccines readily available and recommended for everyone age 5 years and older, more people are traveling and including travel in their holiday plans.While we welcome the return of more human connection, one unwelcome consequence is an increase in influenza activity. With COVID-19 prevention measures in place, the 2020–21 influenza season was marked by historically low influenza virus circulation. However, influenza activity is on the rebound for 2021–22. With the return of influenza comes both mild and severe illness in all ages, including infants, pregnant people, older adults, and people with chronic health conditions. Influenza vaccines are readily available. However, vaccination rates for influenza and other routinely recommended vaccines have dropped substantially compared to last year and the year before.3 Lower vaccination rates for influenza with widespread circulation of influenza viruses could increase the magnitude of the wave of sick people requiring virus testing, outpatient visits, lost school time, and hospitalizations, further taxing our healthcare workers and causing unnecessary illness and suffering.For many reasons, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we are seeing a decline in influenza vaccination rates to date in all age groups and pregnant people. Comparing the week ending November 27, 2021, with the same time last season, vaccination rates are 7 percentage points lower for all children this season, 14 percentage points lower for pregnant persons, and 17 percentage points lower in the Medicare fee-for-service >65 population.3 And fewer people have been vaccinated at their pharmacy or doctor’s offices compared to this time last year.3 Not surprisingly, the numbers are even lower for children and adults in racial and ethnic minority communities.We must act quickly to turn this around. While influenza disease burden is low right now, we’re seeing outbreaks return, mostly in southern states and on college campuses.4 Now is the time to vaccinate. While influenza most often peaks in February, influenza can spread very quickly once transmission starts in an institution or community setting.The burden of influenza is not to be taken lightly. While it varies widely each year, the CDC estimates that in the last decade, each influenza season has resulted in anywhere from 9 to 41 million illnesses, 140,000 to 710,000 hospitalizations, and 12,000 to 52,000 deaths.5 The average annual total economic burden due to influenza is estimated to be $11.2 billion.6Healthcare providers’ reminders and recommendations are key to improving uptake of vaccines, including influenza. Recent surveys from the National Foundation for Infectious Disease show that less than half of adults with a chronic condition report having received an influenza vaccine as of early November. Additionally, less than a third of healthcare providers say they recommend annual influenza vaccines to all of their patients with chronic health conditions. With many people focused on getting COVID-19 vaccine boosters for themselves or COVID-19 vaccine primary series for their children, influenza vaccination must be on the to-do list as well.Influenza and COVID-19 vaccines may be given at the same time, a practice that CDC has advised is both safe and effective. Co-administering vaccines is key to helping patients get caught up on needed vaccines efficiently while reducing unnecessary visits.

Download PDF Copy By Hidaya Aliouche, B.Sc.Reviewed by Sophia Coveney The 'Twindemic' refers to the co-occurrence of both the flu and the novel coronavirus. Although these viruses differ in their pathogenesis, there is a cooperative effect thought to be induced causing both flu and COVID-19 cases to rise simultaneously and overwhelm healthcare resources. Image Credit: Dmitry Demidovich/Shutterstock.com Currently, many countries across the world have observed the lowest influence levels in recent history. However COVID-19 continues to persist and with the easing of restrictions related to the pandemic, several countries risk an increase in case numbers for both COVID-19 and influenza. This phenomenon has been termed the 'Twindemic'. When did the term 'Twindemic' appear? The term 'Twindemic' first appeared in August 2020 in a New York Times article. The Times attributed the coinage of the term to Chief Strategy Officer For the Immunisation Action Coalition, LJ Tan Ph.D. The coalition is a non-profit group to increase vaccine uptake. Theories to explain low rates of influenza in 2020 In winter 2020, countries across the world, including Chile, Australia, South Africa, and Europe, experienced one of the mildest flu seasons recorded. For example, the annual number of cases in Australia is typically between 80,000 and 250,000 (as confirmed by lab testing), however, in 2020, the figure was approximately 20,000, leading to the belief that influenza had minimal impact. Indeed, the World Health Organisation reported that <0.2% of respiratory swab specimens tested from people globally between September 2020 on January 2021 were positive for influenza viruses. This contrasts significantly with the three previous seasons from September 2017 to 2020 demonstrating an average of 17% positive testing for the influenza virus. Theories regarding the relatively low rates of Influenza include population immunity due to lower prevalence of circulating strains, or reduced variance in the circulating strains. However, the most popular theory attributes the reduced incidence of influenza to the measures put in place to stop the spread of COVID-19, particularly in the Northern Hemisphere. This includes social distancing, mandatory mask-wearing, along with border closing, quarantines, hand washing campaigns, and the shutting down of non-essential public places each reduced the exposure and spread. This is related to the term “flattening the curve”, which has been used within periods of pandemics; specifically, the great influenza of 1918 which killed 50 million people across the world. Measures designed to quarantine and isolate infected individuals were shown to be effective, causing death rates from influenza to drop in cities that rigorously implemented these measures. In 2021, the most effective means of protection of vaccines. Reports from the southern hemisphere demonstrated surges in influenza vaccinations over the winter of 2020. Reasons for the occurrence of a 'Twindemic' in 2021 Although the delta continues to be highly transmissible, easing of restrictions has resulted in increased mixing within populations across the world. Consequently, lax approaches to social distancing and mask-wearing are unlikely to increase rates of transmission. Moreover, low influenza infections in 2020 have resulted in reduced immunity for the subsequent year, and the production of an efficacious vaccine has been difficult. Together, increased rates of transmission are expected due to increased exposure to more virulent strains of influenza.

This forewarns an increased number of influenza infections over the 2021 winter. The importance of vaccinations in preventing a 'Twindemic' In the United States, the center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) updated flu guidelines in an attempt to mitigate the effects of the 'Twindemic'. In conjunction with the revised guidelines, the introduction of the COVID-19 vaccine is considered to be a key means of mitigating surges in both influenza and influenza-like illnesses during the coming year. The most salient update to the CDC immunization guidelines mandate that all vaccines add ministered must be quadrivalent, that is, capable of protecting against all four of the most viral strains of influenza. These include influenza A through D, to ensure an enhanced level of protection for vaccine recipients relative to earlier years. The immunity to influenza is determined by several variables which include previous exposure to influenza, vaccination history, and the prevalence of the strain relative to commonly circulating strains in earlier seasons. Influenza seasons also vary in severity and length, and this is dependent on the predominant viral strain in conjunction with the immunity of the population. The impact of vaccinations on the 'Twindemic' Vaccination coverage tends to vary by country, however, influenza vaccination tends to be administered to infants, those who are considered to be at risk (that is, those who are immunocompromised, have chronic health conditions, are over the age of 50, are pregnant, or work in the healthcare sector). This year, vaccination coverage is thought to be more expansive, routinely being recommended to anybody over the age of six months (as in the US) without any underlying comorbidities. Recently, a clinical trial to assess committing administration of any vaccine with the COVID-19 vaccine or adenoviral vaccine demonstrated that the combination with the influenza vaccine is safe, and produces immunogenicity after a level comparable to separate vaccinations. This subsequently supports combination vaccines as a safe and efficacious intervention to prevent a possible 'Twindemic'. As such, the uptake of the influenza vaccine represents a key intervention for the reduction in the severity of acute respiratory illnesses and preventing associated morbidity and mortality. The role of vaccine hesitancy in the risk of the 'Twindemic' The World Health Organisation, however, has reported significant declines in the receipt of the COVID-19 vaccine, reflecting vaccine hesitancy. This is defined, by the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts, as a “delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccination despite the availability of vaccination services”. Across the world, vaccine hesitancy has increased with a decrease in vaccination rates which has led to an increase in the outbreak of vaccine-preventable diseases. As such, efforts are urgently needed to tackle vaccine hesitancy and improve vaccine acceptance among populations across the world. Several recommendations to approach this include partnership of researchers and local health workers to produce culturally sensitive vaccination education programs, create and distribute vaccine educational material, the use of fact sheets to prevent misinformation and tackle myths regarding the COVID-19 and influenza vaccines, and efforts to ensure that vaccines are equally accessible.

Twitter Email Vaccination after CAR-T-cell therapy From the Hill group, Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division and the UW/Fred Hutch Cancer Consortium December 20, 2021 • By B Traxinger Chimeric antigen receptor-modified T (CAR-T) cell therapies are an effective treatment for some blood cancers such as B cell-lineage lymphoma and leukemia. Although often successful in the elimination of tumors, CAR-T cellsâwhich are T cells taken from the patient and engineered to recognize and attack tumor antigensâoften have widespread effects, collaterally destroying non-malignant B cell-lineage cells. This side effect, along with the cancer itself or underlying anti-tumor treatments, âcan lead to long-standing B cell depletion and hypogammaglobulinemia and can put individuals at risk for infection for months and maybe years after CAR-T cell therapy, even when the underlying malignancy has been cured,â said Dr. Carla Walti, the lead author on a recent Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer publication. Vaccination is generally the most successful strategy to prevent respiratory infection, illness, and death, but the efficacy of vaccination before and after CAR-T-cell therapy is unknown, as CAR-T cell patients may have impaired immune responses that are not well primed by vaccines. Specifically, patients with B cell-lineage cancers may have impaired antibody production, as antibodies are made by a subset of B cells. To study this question, Dr. Walti from Dr. Joshua Hillâs group in the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division and collaborators from Fred Hutch and the University of Washington performed a study of the humoral immunogenicity elicited by the inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) in CAR-T-cell therapy patients compared to non-immunocompromised controls. The subjects were immunized either before or after CAR-T-cell therapy and their blood subsequently tested for the increased presence of vaccine-elicited antibodies compared to baseline. Summary of longitudinal influenza antibody kinetics and geometric mean titers (GMTs). Image from publication. Â In the group receiving IIV before CAR-T-cell treatment, 40% of people generated neutralizing antibody responses to at least one out of four influenza vaccine strains out to day 30 post-CAR-T treatment, with one patient retaining neutralizing titers over 100-days post treatment. Of the remaining 60%, one generated an increase in antibody titers at day 30 post-treatment. In the group receiving immunization after CAR-T-cell therapy, 31% of the group robustly responded to at least one IIV strain at 30 days post-immunization, while an additional 46% generated a moderate response. Together, these results suggest that both cohorts experienced a modest average increase in IIV-induced antibody titer, although those who were immunized pre-CAR-T-cell therapy experienced a relatively rapid decrease in antibody titers. The authors further explored possible predictors of immunogenicity to IIV, but found that factors such as age, sex, type of malignancy, or time post-CAR-T-cell therapy did not correlate with immunogenicity and importantly, low B cell counts and hypogammaglobulinemia did not preclude responses. This study is the first to investigate pre-CAR-T-cell therapy vaccination and one of the first to test vaccine immunogenicity after CAR-T-cell therapy. Together, this work demonstrated that despite substantial tumor- and anti-tumor treatment-induced immunodeficiencies, vaccination against influenza either before or after CAR-T-cell therapy induced robust antibody responses to at least one vaccine strain in 31-40% and partial responses in 60-77% of individuals in the study. âAlthough more work is needed, we believe that this data supports consideration for vaccination before and after CAR-T cell therapy and irrespective of B cell depletion and hypogammaglobulinemia,â said Dr. Walti. Going forward, the authors are âcurrently working on studies investigating vaccine responses to additional vaccines in a larger cohort,â and further studies are necessary to identify predictors of vaccine-induced immunity, Dr. Walti said. However, this work also âilluminated relatively impaired antibody responses to the seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine in CAR-T cell therapy recipients. This indicates suboptimal protection from infection and the need for additional infection-prevention strategiesâ in this vulnerable cohort, Dr. Walti explained. âThe data from our study have illuminated relatively impaired antibody responses to the seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine in CAR-T cell therapy recipients. This indicates suboptimal protection from infection and the need for additional infection-prevention strategies,â Dr. Walti said.

Here’s what happened with the last ones Volunteer nurses from the American Red Cross tend to influenza patients in the Oakland Municipal Auditorium in 1918. (Library of Congress ) By Jessica RoyAssistant Editor, Utility Journalism Dec. 23, 2021 5 AM PT Share Share via Close extra sharing options Email Facebook X LinkedIn Threads Reddit WhatsApp Copy Link URLCopied! Print This started as a story about what happens after a pandemic ends.I pitched my editor on the idea in early May. Every adult in America could get a vaccine. COVID numbers started to fall. If the Roaring ’20s came after the Spanish flu a century ago, did that mean we were on track for another Roaring ’20s now? Would “Hot Vax Summer” give way to Decadent Gatsby Party Autumn?I started to dig in. A number of compelling parallels emerged: America 100 years ago had staggering income inequality. A booming stock market. Racial uprisings. Anti-immigrant sentiment. A one-term president plagued by scandals after he left office. Plenty of material for a story.Then the pandemic didn’t end.Vaccinations stalled. The Delta variant fueled new waves of infections, hospitalizations and deaths. By September, some states had more hospitalized COVID patients than they did during the winter surge. The economic outlook for this decade has gone from “champagne-soaked” to “room temperature.” In late November, the World Health Organization announced a new “variant of concern”: Omicron, which is currently on the cusp of pummeling California. Advertisement I called a meeting with my editor. I said I didn’t think it was a good time to write a story in which the premise was “this pandemic is over, now what?”The pandemic wasn’t ending. Would it ever? Science & Medicine One year of vaccines: Many lives saved, many needlessly lost The first full year of the biggest vaccination drive in American history has saved many lives but has left many behind.Dec. 13, 2021 This is not humanity’s first time staring down a seemingly unstoppable disease. Pandemics (a disease affecting a large number of people in multiple countries or regions around the world, per the World Health Organization), epidemics (a disease affecting people in a country or region) and outbreaks (a sudden occurrence of an infectious disease) have plagued us throughout history. Just in the past century, we’ve survived a few. How did those end? And how might we get ourselves out of this one?Spanish flu This photo made available by the Library of Congress shows a demonstration at the Red Cross Emergency Ambulance Station in Washington during the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic. (Library of Congress ) Advertisement How it started: Unclear, but probably not in Spain. It was a particularly deadly strain of H1N1 influenza and first took root in the U.S. in Kansas.The disease was so virulent and killed so many young people that if you heard, “‘This is just ordinary influenza by another name,’ you knew that was a lie,” said John Barry, the author of “The Great Influenza.” There was “zero partisanship” over the virus, Barry said. If the flu did hit your town, it hit hard: A young person could wake up in the morning feeling well and be dead 24 hours later. Half the people who died of the flu in 1918 were in their 20s and 30s. Advertisement “It was a spooky time,” said Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Assn.So how did we, as a species, beat the Spanish flu? We didn’t. We survived it. It torched through individual communities until it ran out of people to infect. A third of the world’s population was believed to have contracted the Spanish flu during that pandemic, and it had a case-fatality rate of as high as 10-20% globally and 2.5% in the United States. (Johns Hopkins University reports the COVID-19 case fatality rate in the U.S. is 1.6% as of December 2021.) Roughly 675,000 people in America died out of a population of 103.2 million, a number recently surpassed by COVID-19 victims of a 2020 U.S. population of 329.5 million. Flu vaccines wouldn’t be developed until the 1930s and wouldn’t become widely available for another decade.Ultimately, the virus went through a process called attenuation. Basically, it got less bad. We still have descendent strains of the Spanish flu floating around today. It’s endemic, not a pandemic. As a society, we accept a certain amount of death from known diseases. The normal seasonal flu usually kills less than 0.1% of people who contract it. Deaths have been between 12,000 and 52,000 people in the U.S. annually for the past decade.The regular seasonal flu is both less contagious and less deadly than COVID-19. That people were washing hands, working from home and socially distancing in the winter 2020 flu season likely contributed to the fact that it was a comparably light flu season. Though business and school closures weren’t enough to stave off the devastating winter surge of COVID, the measures were sufficient to keep the flu at bay. One strain may have been completely extinguished. As places reopen and people feel more confident about socializing and traveling again, the flu could make a calamitous comeback. (By the way, have you gotten your flu shot yet?)How it ended: EndemicPolio In this April 1955 file photo, first- and second-graders are inoculated against polio in Los Angeles. (Associated Press) Advertisement How it started: The first documented polio epidemic in the United States was in 1894. Outbreaks occurred throughout the first half of the 20th century, primarily killing children and leaving many more paralyzed.Polio reached pandemic levels by the 1940s. There were more than 600,000 cases of polio in the United States in the 20th century, and nearly 60,000 deaths — a case fatality rate of 9.8%. In 1952 alone, there were 57,628 reported cases of polio resulting in 3,145 deaths. “Polio was every mother’s scourge,” Benjamin said. “People were afraid to death of polio.”Polio was highly contagious: In a household with an infected adult or child, 90% to 100% of susceptible people would develop evidence in their blood of also having been infected. Polio is not spread through the air — transmission occurs from oral-oral infection (say, sharing a drinking glass), or by “what’s nicely called hand-fecal,” Paula Cannon, a virology professor at the USC Keck School of Medicine, told me. “People poop it out, and people get it on their hands and they make you a sandwich.”Polio, like COVID, could have devastating long-term effects even if you survived the initial infection. President Franklin Roosevelt was among the thousands of people who lived with permanent paralysis from polio. Others spent weeks, years, or the rest of their lives in iron lungs.Precautions were taken during the polio pandemic. Schools and public pools closed. Then, in 1955, a miracle: a vaccine. A two-dose course of the polio vaccine proved to be about 90% effective — similar to the effectiveness of our current COVID vaccines. Vaccine technology was still relatively new, and the polio vaccine was not without side effects. A small number of people who got that vaccine got polio from it. Another subset of recipients developed Guillain-Barre syndrome, a noncontagious autoimmune disorder that can cause paralysis or nerve damage. A botched batch killed some of the people who received it. Advertisement But there were no masses of polio anti-vaxxers. It was a “whole sense of the greater good, that this was the only way out of this terrible scourge,” Cannon said. “You would have had to have been a psychopathic monster to not want to be part of the solution.”Benjamin said the polio vaccine campaign became a moment of national unity: “Jonas Salk and the folks that solved the polio problem were national heroes.” By 1979, polio was eradicated in the United States.How it ended: Vaccination Science & Medicine Research shows huge benefit of COVID-19 booster shots In a large study, the risk of a breakthrough infection was 10 times lower for people who got a COVID-19 booster shot than for people who hadn’t.Dec. 9, 2021 SmallpoxHow it started: The disease had been observed in the Eastern hemisphere dating to as early as 1157 BCE, and European colonizers first brought smallpox to North America’s previously unexposed Native population in the early 1500s. A 2019 study suggested smallpox and other viruses introduced by colonizers killed as much as 90% of the indigenous population in some areas. Globally, smallpox is estimated to have killed more than 300 million people just in the 20th century. The case fatality rate of variola major, which caused the majority of smallpox infections, is around 30%.Outbreaks continued in North America through the centuries after it arrived here, at one point infecting half the population of the city of Boston. We fought back by trying to infect people with a weakened version of it, long before vaccines existed. An enslaved man named Onesimus is believed to have introduced the concept of smallpox inoculation to North America in 1721 when he told slave owner Cotton Mather that he had undergone it in West Africa. Mather tried to convince Boston doctors to consider inoculating residents during that outbreak, to limited success. One doctor who inoculated 287 patients reported only 2% of them died of smallpox, compared to a 14.8% death rate among the general population.In 1777, George Washington ordered troops who had not already had the disease to undergo a version of inoculation in which pus from a smallpox sore was introduced into an open cut. Most people who were inoculated developed a mild case of smallpox, then developed natural immunity. Some died, though at a far lower rate compared with other ways of contracting the disease. The practice of inoculation was controversial enough — some skeptics said it was not sufficiently tested, some argued it was doctors “playing God,” others theorized that it was a conspiracy from slaves to trick white slave owners into killing themselves — that it was banned in several colonies.Edward Jenner first demonstrated the effectiveness of his newly created smallpox vaccine in England in 1796. Vaccination spread throughout the world, and deaths from smallpox became rarer over time: In a century, smallpox went from being responsible for 1 in 13 deaths in London to about 1 in 100. Advertisement But while early vaccines reduced smallpox’s power, it still existed: An outbreak hit New York City in 1947. It demonstrated that the vaccines were not 100% effective in everyone forever: 47-year-old Eugene Le Bar, the first fatality, had a smallpox vaccine scar. Israel Weinstein, the city’s health commissioner, held a news conference urging all New Yorkers to get vaccinated against smallpox, whether for the first time or what we would now call a “booster shot.”The mayor and President Truman got vaccinated on camera. In less than one month, 6.35 million New Yorkers were vaccinated, in a city of 7.8 million. The final toll of the New York outbreak: 12 cases of smallpox, resulting in 2 deaths.Our country’s final outbreak affected 8 people in the Rio Grande Valley in 1949.In 1959, the World Health Organization announced a plan to eradicate smallpox globally with vaccinations. The disease was declared eradicated in 1980. Of all the diseases our species has tackled, “the only one we’ve ever been really successful to totally eradicating is smallpox,” Benjamin said. The only remaining smallpox pathogens exist in laboratories.How it ended: Vaccination California One woman helped move the needle on Black vaccination in South L.A. She’s ‘Mama Tsega’ She’s called “Mama Tsega,” a determined community activist and City Hall confidant who speaks five languages and uses all of them to push for change.Dec. 10, 2021 HIV/AIDS Advertisement How it started: In 1981, the CDC announced the first cases of what we would later call AIDS. Roughly half of Americans who contracted HIV in the early 1980s died of an HIV/AIDS-related condition within two years. Deaths from HIV peaked in the 1990s, with roughly 50,000 in 1995, and have decreased steadily since then: As of 2019, roughly 1.2 million Americans are HIV-positive; there were 5,044 deaths attributed to HIV that year.The Reagan administration did not take HIV seriously for years. Unlike COVID, which was quickly identified as a respiratory disease, HIV spread for years before scientists knew for sure how it was transmitted. Gay activists who encouraged their community to use condoms in the early 1980s were criticized as “sex-negative.” Today, we know how to prevent the spread of HIV, and treatments for it have progressed to the point where early intervention can make the virus completely undetectable. “If you’re HIV positive, the HIV pandemic never went away for you,” said Cannon, who’s spent much of her career studying the virus. She described it as a “great irony” that we identified the cause of COVID and developed a vaccine within a year, only to have people refuse it: “Anybody with HIV would tell you that the opposite is true for HIV, where despite decades now of research, we have not been able to come up with vaccines that work against this shapeshifter of a virus that is HIV, and people would be desperately pleased if there were vaccines.”Around 700,000 people in the U.S. have died of HIV-related illnesses in the 40 years since the disease appeared. In less than two years of the COVID-19 pandemic, we’ve surpassed 800,000 COVID deaths.How it ended: Endemic Science & Medicine Did failure to adequately treat HIV patients give rise to the Omicron variant? The Omicron variant was probably incubated in a person with poorly controlled HIV who struggled to clear a coronavirus infection.Dec. 2, 2021 SARSHow it started: SARS first appeared in China in 2002 before making its way to the United States and 28 other countries. Advertisement Severe acute respiratory syndrome — quickly shortened to SARS in headlines and news coverage — is caused by a coronavirus named SARS-CoV, or SARS-associated coronavirus. COVID-19 is caused by a virus so similar that it’s called SARS-CoV-2.Globally, more than 8,000 people contracted SARS during the outbreak, and 916 died. (By comparison, there were 10 times more cases of COVID-19 than that registered globally by the end of February 2020.)One hundred fifteen cases of SARS were suspected in the United States; only 8 people had laboratory-confirmed cases of the disease, and none of them died.Like COVID-19, fatality rates from SARS were very low for young people — less than 1% for people under 25 — up to a more than 50% rate for people over 65. Overall, the case fatality rate was 11%.Public anxiety was widespread, including in areas unaffected by SARS.SARS and COVID-19 have a lot in common. But the diseases — and the way the government responded to them — weren’t exactly the same, said Benjamin, who worked for the CDC during the SARS epidemic. Advertisement “There wasn’t asymptomatic spread. Early on we had a functional test. We had a public health system that was in much better shape than it is today. All those things went wrong this time,” he said. “And [COVID-19] turned out to be much more infectious, it turned out to have asymptomatic spread. ... [In 2020] you had a public health system which wasn’t ready for prime time because it hadn’t been invested in.”Conversely, he said, the response to SARS was robust and immediate. The WHO issued a global alert about an unknown and severe form of pneumonia in Asia on March 12, 2003. The CDC activated its Emergency Operations Center by March 14, and issued an alert for travelers entering the U.S. from Hong Kong and parts of China the next day. Pandemic planning and guidance went into effect by the end of that month.“When [public health organizations] had the actual genetic sequence mapped out and then they made a test for it, they rapidly got that test out to state and local health departments, they began screening, doing surveillance, we contained it very quickly, we communicated effectively to the public, and it worked,” he said.In the case of SARS, the disease stopped spreading before a vaccine or cure could be created. Scientists knew another coronavirus could emerge that was more contagious. They laid the groundwork for developing the COVID-19 vaccines we have now.How it ended: Died out after being controlled by public health measuresSwine flu Passengers wait inside a subway station in Mexico City in 2009 after a government-ordered shutdown designed to contain the swine flu outbreak. (Brennan Linsley / Associated Press) How it started: Both the Spanish flu and swine flu were caused by the same type of virus: influenza A H1N1. Advertisement Ultimately, according to the CDC, there were about 60.8 million cases of swine flu in the U.S. from April 2009 to April 2010, with 274,304 hospitalizations and 12,469 deaths — a case fatality rate of about 0.02%. So there were millions more cases of swine flu than there were of COVID-19 in the same time period, but a fraction of the fatalities. Eighty percent of swine flu deaths were in people younger than 65.It was first detected in California on April 15, 2009, and the CDC and the Obama administration declared public health emergencies before the end of that month. As with COVID-19, hospital visits spiked. Hundreds of schools closed down temporarily. In Texas, a children’s hospital set up tents in the parking lot to handle emergency room overflow; several hospitals in North Carolina banned children from visiting. Hospitals near Colorado Springs, Colo., reported a 30% increase in flu visits. Three-hundred-thousand doses of liquid Tamiflu for children were released from the national pandemic stockpile.In the same month cases were first detected, the CDC started identifying the virus strain for a potential vaccine. The first flu shots with H1N1 protections went into arms in October 2009. WHO declared the swine flu pandemic over in August 2010. But like Spanish flu, swine flu never completely went away.How it ended: EndemicEbolaHow it started: From 2014 to 2016, 28,616 people in West Africa had Ebola, and 11,310 died — a 39.5% case fatality rate. Despite widespread fears about it spreading here — including close to 100 tweets from the man who would be president when the COVID-19 pandemic began — only two people contracted Ebola on U.S. soil, and neither died.So how did we escape Ebola? Unlike COVID, Ebola isn’t transmitted in the air, and there’s no asymptomatic spread. It spreads through the bodily fluids of people actively experiencing symptoms, either directly or through bedding and other objects they’ve touched. If you haven’t been within three feet of a person with Ebola, you have almost no risk of getting it. Advertisement Part of the problem in Africa, Benjamin said, was that families traditionally washed the bodies of the deceased, exposing themselves to infected fluids. And healthcare workers who treated patients without proper protective equipment or awareness of heightened safety procedures were at risk. Once adequate equipment was delivered to affected areas and precautions were taken by healthcare workers and families of the victims, the disease could be controlled. People needed to temporarily change their behavior to respond to the public health crisis, and they did.While this particular outbreak ended in 2016, it’s very possible we will see another Ebola event in the future. An Ebola vaccine was approved by the FDA in 2019.How it ended: Subsided after being controlled by public health measuresHow will COVID end? More than 27,000 people had died of COVID-19 in Los Angeles County, and nearly 800,000 in the U.S., as of mid-December. Here, flags at the Griffith Observatory memorialize L.A.’s dead. (Luis Sinco / Los Angeles Times) Big picture, “pandemics end because the disease is unable to transmit itself through people or other vectors that allow the transmission of the disease,” Benjamin said. The most likely outcome at this point is that COVID-19 is here to stay, he said: “I think most people now think that it will be endemic for a while.” On Twitter, his colleagues in epidemiology and public health seem to agree. COVID has a lot going for it, as far as viruses go: Unlike Ebola and SARS, it can be spread by people who don’t realize they have it. Unlike smallpox, it can jump species, infecting animals and then potentially reinfecting us. Unlike polio, one person can unwittingly spread it to a room full of people, and not enough people are willing to get vaccinated at once to stop it in its tracks. It’s less contagious than swine flu, and less deadly than Ebola, landing it in a sort of perverse sweet spot where it infects a lot of people but doesn’t kill enough of them to run out of victims. For many people, it’s mild enough that it convinces others they don’t have to take the disease or precautions against it seriously. No one thought that about smallpox or Ebola. Advertisement In a conversation I had with Cannon for a different story in May 2020, she told me if someone were designing a virus with the maximum capacity to succeed, it would look a lot like this coronavirus.“One of the really superpower things about this virus is its stealthiness,” she told me then. “So you can feel fine, you can go hang out with friends and not obey the six-foot rule and the next morning you feel like death and you’re like, ‘oh crap.’” Back then, she contrasted it with the way we shut down SARS: “The reason we could stop it is everybody who had SARS, you were only infectious while you were sick. You woke up one day feeling like death and that was the day you were infectious. Infected people couldn’t walk among us. ... With this coronavirus, they walk amongst us.”So what happens next? In some populations, enough people will get vaccinated to achieve something like herd immunity. In others, it will burn through the population until everyone’s had it, and either achieves naturally gained immunity (which confers less long-term protection than vaccination) or dies. People still die from influenza and HIV in the United States; a disease becoming endemic isn’t exactly a happy ending.“We tolerate the tragedy a lot better when it’s a disease that we’ve seen before,” Benjamin said. “It is less scary to us.”Based on where we are now, “I don’t think COVID-19 will ever go away,” Cannon said. We’re still learning about the Omicron variant. Early reports out of South Africa suggest it may be a more contagious but milder version of the disease, though it’s too early to say for sure. In a perfect world, COVID would go away entirely; with that possibility almost certainly off the table, an attenuated strain that displaces the Delta variant and turns COVID into an illness that rarely requires hospitalization is perhaps the best we can hope for at this point.How it ends: A combination of vaccine- and naturally-gained immunity, attenuation, availability of rapid testing, and improvements in treatment for active cases could turn it into what skeptics wrongly called it to begin with: a bad cold or flu.

Iwasaki, who is Waldemar Von Zedtwitz Professor of Immunobiology and professor of molecular, cellular, and developmental biology and of epidemiology (microbial diseases), discusses her new research, which was published December 10 in Science Immunology.People have been getting flu shots for 40 years or more, and more recently COVID-19 vaccinations, but your research suggests that a nasal vaccine may be a more effective approach to stopping respiratory virus. What did you find?Akiko Iwasaki: We found that local mucosal immunity that's established by intranasal vaccination elicits a much more robust and cross reactive, cross protective immunity than a conventional vaccine that uses intramuscular injection. And the way we got to this knowledge is that we were comparing different routes of vaccine administration and found that only after the intranasal vaccination, there are these antibodies that are secreted into the mucosa known as IgA. And this IgA coats the mucus membrane and mucus surface and protects the host by preventing the virus from entering the body. So it's like putting the guard outside of the door instead of inside the door where antibodies normally work, inside the body.What is special about mucosal linings as a system for delivery as opposed to delivering a vaccine systemically through injection? Iwasaki: Essentially there are really two compartments of the immune system. One is the systemic circular compartment where T cells and B cells and antibodies circulate and survey for infection. And an entirely different compartment is the mucosal compartment where you can immunize and induce immune responses within those particular mucosal surfaces. That allows for local immune response to be elicited. So antibody T cells and B cells are now focused in that particular mucosal membrane. And because they're right there at the right place where the pathogen enters, they can act much more quickly and much more effectively and more broadly across different variants of viruses. This study focused on influenza virus, but might your findings be applicable to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID?Iwasaki: Yes, absolutely. This study is really understanding the basics of the immune system and how it works within the mucosal tissue. And we can apply nasal vaccine strategy to any other virus, including SARS-CoV-2. And that's essentially what we're doing. We have a study that we're writing up to be able to publish soon where we are combining some of the mucosal strategy to elicit local immunity against SARS-CoV-2, essentially to establish this cross protective, long-lasting immunity within the respiratory mucosa. Universal flu vaccine is a goal in society and the scientific community. Does this research on nasal flu vaccination help us get there? Iwasaki: I think mucosal vaccines will provide us with the tool to develop the universal flu vaccine, or maybe universal coronavirus vaccine, and [vaccines for] many other respiratory infections. This research is supported through a National Institutes of Health mechanism to develop universal flu vaccine. The reason for the promise of the mucosal vaccine is that it provides local immunity and the fact that this IgA, which is a dimer (a structure consisting of two identical components) of an antibody, has four binding sites instead of two binding sites. And so it allows that antibody to bind to surfaces of the virus even after a little bit of mutations accumulate. It’s much more resistant to variations on the viral surface. So I think combined with that, with the right kind of immunogen, we should be able to achieve the goal of universal flu vaccines or universal viral vaccines of other types.Would a nasal vaccine need to be delivered more often than an injected vaccine, or is there a mechanism by which the protection lasts?Iwasaki: The beauty of the local mucosal vaccine is that not only does it provide protection acutely, but also it’s a long-lasting immunity. What happens is that these T cells and B cells come into that mucosal surface and they remain there and they become what’s known as tissue-resident memory cells.What work had been done at Yale, whether in your lab or elsewhere, to set the stage for nasal vaccines against viruses? Iwasaki: There were just many, many findings over the years. It's not something that we just came up with overnight. My lab started 21 years ago trying to understand how herpes simplex virus infects the host and how we can manipulate the immune system to block that process. So we have this “prime and pull” strategy to be able to block primary infection as well as potentially therapeutic vaccines against existing genital herpes. Other applications include a vaccination strategy with a cervical cancer vaccine. We have a collaboration with Dr. Alessandro Santin here at Yale, where we are using that strategy to establish immune response within the cervix of women who have pre-cancerous lesions with HPV. For those two viruses, presumably it isn’t an intranasal approach. Iwasaki: With the genital herpes and the cervical cancer vaccine, the mucosal immunity is in the genital mucosa. The application is obviously through different routes, but the concept is the same.Is there anything else you want to add?Iwasaki: I think that the mucosal vaccine will supplement and complement the existing vaccines against COVID, and it might help people who are afraid to take the needle because the nasal vaccine is basically going to be a spray. So you just take it as nasal spray and it's a little bit less scary. So hopefully that will increase the number of people who want to vaccinate themselves.TagsBasic Science ResearchFacultyCoronavirusFeatured in this articleAkiko Iwasaki, PhDSterling Professor of Immunobiology and Professor of Dermatology and of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology and of Epidemiology (Microbial Diseases); Investigator, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, (HHMI)Yale School of Medicine333 Cedar StreetNew Haven, CT 06510Maps & DirectionsPioneeringEducation, Patient Care& ResearchSupport Us420 Eventsyou could attend in November 2024CalendarContact UsIntranetSite EditorAccessibility at YSMNondiscrimination & Title IXSafety & SecurityTerms & Privacy StatementYale UniversityLibrary & ReferenceManage Cookie Preferences© 2024 Yale School of Medicine.

Please look at the time stamp on the story to see when it was last updated. Flu season may be especially bad over the next few months due to a “mismatch” in this year’s annual vaccine, StudyFinds.org reports. According to scientists examining this year’s vaccine and its ability to stop 2021’s dominant flu strains, the team finds the shot is unable to beat a mutation in the flu which will likely be the main variety infecting people this winter. It’s important recognize these findings are being shared in a pre-print study — meaning the paper is still awaiting peer-review and should not yet be used to guide clinical advice. Researchers say a mutation in the H3N2 subtype of the influenza virus is spreading worldwide. The flu vaccination doctors created for this season, the 2021-2022 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccine, appears to do a poor job of neutralizing this particular mutation of H3N2. Simply put, people getting the annual flu shot may still get sick because the vaccine antibodies don’t line up with virus strains circulating. Scientists are calling this H3N2 “clade” — a split in the virus’s family tree — “3C.2a1b.2a2” (or 2a2). “3C.2a1b.2a2 H3N2 viruses efficiently replicate in human cells and could potentially cause an antigenic mismatch if they continue to circulate at high levels during the 2021-2022 influenza season,” reports corresponding author Scott Hensley from the University of Pennsylvania in the pre-print server medRxiv. The team adds that 2a2 has been circulating “at elevated levels” across the United States over the last few weeks in November and December 2021. “This clade emerged early in the COVID-19 pandemic and almost completely displaced other H3N2 clades in Europe, Oceania, South Asia, West Asia, and North America in 2021,” study authors add. Why don’t flu shots defend against all flu strains? It’s an age-old question: why does the annual flu shot only protect against some varieties of the flu? Although scientists continue to work on creating a universal flu vaccine, the seasonal inoculation works much differently. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, scientists try to pinpoint which strains of the flu will be the most dominant throughout an upcoming season and then tailor that year’s vaccine to work against those varieties. In the U.S., all seasonal flu vaccines are “quadrivalent” vaccines — meaning they stop four different flu viruses. These include an influenza A(H1N1) virus, an influenza A(H3N2) virus, and two influenza B viruses. Despite taking their best guess, even health officials admit the annual shot varies widely from year to year. “The protection provided by a flu vaccine varies from season to season and depends in part on the age and health status of the person getting the vaccine and the similarity or ‘match’ between the viruses in the vaccine and those in circulation,” the CDC writes. Vaccinations are still vital, even with the mismatch In the pre-print review, researchers studied 40 healthy people after they received the annual flu vaccine. Those tests reveal more than half of the vaccine recipients had poor protection against the new H3N2 clade. In fact, Hensley notes on Twitter that 55 percent of the vaccines “had undetectable levels of neutralizing antibodies against 2a2 H3N2 after vaccination.” Despite the apparent mismatch in this season’s flu shot, the researchers still encourage people to get a flu shot this winter. They add that even in years where the shot does a below-average job of blocking certain flu strains, they do keep more people from developing serious and potentially fatal symptoms. “Studies have clearly shown that seasonal influenza vaccines consistently prevent hospitalizations and deaths even in years where there are large antigenic mismatches,” Hensley concludes.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported about 2,500 cases from clinical tests nationwide for the week that ended Dec. 11. That number is typical for this time of year, but it also represents a level of cases that has not been seen since before the coronavirus pandemic. New weekly flu cases in the United States Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Note: Figures reflect specimens tested at clinical laboratories. Public health laboratories reported about an additional 500 cases in the week ending Dec. 11, which are not reflected in the chart. It is a bad time for the flu to re-emerge, as the Omicron variant causes a surge in coronavirus cases and with travel expected to increase over the holidays. “We have seen how surges in Covid-19 infections can overwhelm hospitals, and influenza infections could further stress health care systems,” said Sonja Olsen, an epidemiologist at the C.D.C. “If both viruses continue to circulate and increase in activity, the situation could get worse.” The agency considers several factors when assessing influenza activity, including the number of overall patients who report respiratory illnesses, the number of long-term care facilities with at least one case of the flu, the share of flu tests that come back positive and the number of flu patients admitted to hospitals. In recent weeks, all of these indicators have gone up. Since early September, the share of flu tests that have come back positive has risen to 3.5 percent from 0.05 percent. That positive rate is still below the prepandemic average, which may mean that there has been less flu in circulation in recent weeks than what was typical in recent years, Dr. Olsen said. Positive flu tests Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Note: Figures reflect specimens tested at clinical laboratories. The average number of patients with the flu who are admitted to hospitals each day has also risen, to 243 from 43 in early September. For context, the average number of patients with confirmed cases of Covid being admitted to hospitals each day is about 8,200. New hospital patients with influenza Source: Department of Health and Human Services In recent years, the flu season has peaked at an average of 12,500 diagnosed weekly cases, usually in late January or February, but most cases go undiagnosed. The C.D.C. estimates the number of annual flu cases over the past decade has been between nine million and 41 million. It is not yet clear how severe this season will be, but the virus will most likely continue to spread in the weeks to come, Dr. Olsen said, and the flu strain that is now the most dominant in the U.S. has in the past been linked to more-severe flu seasons. That dominant virus, which is a strain of H3N2, is not among the types of flu that this season’s vaccine specifically guards against. That means the flu vaccine may be less effective against that strain, said Richard Webby, a virologist at the St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis. But, he said, it is still worth getting immunized. “Even though it's not a perfect match, and it may not provide you with that protection from getting infected, it's still going to protect you from getting more severe disease,” Dr. Webby said. Dr. Olsen laid out several possible scenarios for the coming flu season. Cases could peak later in the year than usual, or they could drop off sooner than expected. Or there is still a chance that cases remain lower than what was normal before the pandemic. “Of course, we could also experience a more typical season,” she said. “It is too soon to know.” Share full articleAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTSite IndexSite Information Navigation© 2024 The New York Times CompanyNYTCoContact UsAccessibilityWork with usAdvertiseT Brand StudioYour Ad ChoicesPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleSite MapCanadaInternationalHelpSubscriptionsManage Privacy PreferencesCovid: Hyde Park Picture House archive details 1918-19 flu pandemic - BBC NewsBBC HomepageSkip to contentAccessibility HelpYour accountHomeNewsSportEarthReelWorklifeTravelMore menuMore menuSearch BBCHomeNewsSportEarthReelWorklifeTravelCultureFutureMusicTVWeatherSoundsClose menuBBC NewsMenuHomeIsrael-Gaza warWar in UkraineClimateVideoWorldAsiaUKBusinessTechMoreScienceEntertainment & ArtsHealthWorld News TVIn PicturesBBC VerifyNewsbeatEnglandRegionsLeeds & West YorkshireCovid: Hyde Park Picture House archive details 1918-19 flu pandemicPublished24 December 2021Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage source, Hyde Park Picture HouseImage caption, "Influenza epidemic - soldiers, sailors and children barred" - the 1918 restrictions amid the Spanish flu pandemicOne of the country's oldest surviving cinemas has dug through its logbooks and found evidence of its response to a pandemic more than 100 years ago. Hyde Park Picture House, in Leeds, kept a fastidious daily record of takings, ticket sales and film showings after it opened in 1914.About five years ago, a mystery woman dropped off a bin bag filled with almost 30 old ledgers detailing about 40 years of early activity at the picture palace.The scrupulous logs cover the titles being shown, the daily takings and other observations, such as the day's weather."Reading through the logs draws you in, it is quite evocative," says Ollie Jenkins, from the Picture House.Not long after the cinema opened the 1918-19 Spanish flu pandemic was to have a remarkable effect on daily life in Leeds. Image source, Tom MorrisImage caption, Some of the journals were supplied by Jowett and Sowry, LeedsOn its opening day, on Monday 2 November, staff sold 429 tickets across two screenings of My Only Son, taking just under Â£9.As World War One took hold, the cinema continued to open its doors, screening patriotic dramas and newsreels to boost morale in its gas-lit auditorium.It is October 1918 - a month before the Hyde Park Picture Houses' fourth birthday - when the logs first make mention of the Spanish Flu with an entry containing two stark words: "influenza epidemic".On 13 November, two days after the end of the war - which is marked by a special Armistice Day stamp in the ledger - the disease had reached the cinema. The cinema management took measures to try to stop the spread of the virus, as denoted by a logbook entry which reads "soldiers, sailors and children barred". By 25 November 1918 there is a change of heart and the ledger duly notes: "Soldiers and children admitted, influenza still bad"."The flu crisis felt like a very sad time as it combined with the end of World War One," says Mr Jenkins."The war followed by that illness contained a long period of disruption for the cinema and customers, but a big function of the picture house was to show the news reels and boosting morale with patriotic films."There are lots of similarities with what we've gone through with Covid," says Mr Jenkins. "It shows some of the equivalents to our restrictions, including measures on soldiers and sailors who would have been travelling across borders in packed conditions."The 1918-19 epidemicImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Red Cross nurses in 1918 wearing masks to stop the spread of the deadly diseaseKnown as Spanish flu, the virus was thought to have begun in cramped, crowded and unsanitary army training camps on the Western Front - though the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, external says there is no scientific consensus on its origin.It is estimated about one-third of the world's population became infected with the virus. Fatalities were estimated at least 50 million worldwide, it added.Records at the University of Leeds, external show an "astounding 1,401 deaths in Leeds alone" in 1918, (a death rate of 3.28 per 1000 of the population). The following year in 1919, the number of deaths from influenza was still high at 623.The end of the war had left people undernourished and vulnerable, contributing to the severity of the 1918-19 pandemic, according to the university.Children, pregnant women and nursing mothers were particularly affected. The daily logging of life at Hyde Park Picture house continued, unabated and cinema records show royal events such the Prince of Wales' visit to the city in 1923 and a rare day's closure for the death of King George V in 1936.During World War Two air raids and gunfire were mentioned alongside cinema attendances.Image source, Hyde Park Picture HouseImage caption, Did the dry, cold moonlit conditions contribute to the air raid siren and guns sounding on 12 December 1940?The records come to a halt in 1958 and cinema staff hope in future to digitise and properly research the treasure trove. The Grade II listed cinema closed for refurbishment just as the Covid-19 pandemic hit and is due to re-open in September.Image source, Tom JoyImage caption, The Grade II cinema still has gas lighting as it did in 1914A community fundraising drive to pay for renovations has already raised about Â£35,000 and has a target of Â£40,000 by Christmas Eve.The money donated will sponsor the cinema's famous gas lamps and help with upkeep of the Grade II listed lamp-post outside the front door.Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, external, Twitter, external and Instagram, external.

Substantial clinical experience of effectiveness and a well-established safety profile, along with the ease of manufacturing have established emulsion adjuvants as one of the leading platforms for the development of pandemic vaccines. Emulsion adjuvants allow for antigen dose sparing, more rapid immune responses, and enhanced quality and quantity of adaptive immune responses. The mechanisms of enhancement of immune responses are well defined and typically characterized by the creation of an “immunocompetent environment” at the site of injection, followed by the induction of strong and long-lasting germinal center responses in the draining lymph nodes. As a result, emulsion adjuvants induce distinct immunological responses, with a mixed Th1/Th2 T cell response, long-lived plasma cells, an expanded repertoire of memory B cells, and high titers of cross-neutralizing polyfunctional antibodies against viral variants. Because of these various properties, emulsion adjuvants were included in pandemic influenza vaccines deployed during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, are still included in seasonal influenza vaccines, and are currently at the forefront of the development of vaccines against emerging SARS-CoV-2 pandemic variants. Here, we comprehensively review emulsion adjuvants, discuss their mechanism of action, and highlight their profile as a benchmark for the development of additional vaccine adjuvants and as a valuable tool to allow further investigations of the general principles of human immunity.

Since its inclusion in routine childhood vaccines, Alum has accumulated an impressive safety record, with the administration of billions of doses over many decades. However, the impressive safety record of Alum has probably served as a barrier to newer approaches. Nevertheless, Alum continues to provide an important benchmark against which all new adjuvants must be evaluated, as it is safe, effective, and well tolerated, and it remains an invaluable option1. The lower potency of Alum in some situations, such as in combination with vaccines containing highly purified recombinant antigens or those targeting complex pathogens, has triggered an extensive search for new and improved adjuvants. However, progress has been slow, with a single new adjuvant (MF59) included in a licensed vaccine in the late 1990s, two new adjuvants in the 2000s (AS04 and AS03), and two more since (AS01 and CpG1018)2. Consequently, the development of novel adjuvants has been described as one of the slowest processes in medical history3.Two of the novel adjuvants currently included in licensed vaccines for use in humans are the oil-in-water emulsions MF59 and AS03. These adjuvants were widely used during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic and were developed based on a long history of using emulsion adjuvants in humans, dating back to the 1930s4. Water-in-paraffin oil emulsions were briefly included in vaccines licensed for humans in the early 1960s but were subsequently removed from the market because of concerns around reactogenicity and safety4. However, the introduction of biodegradable and biocompatible oils in the 1990s once more opened the door to the use of emulsions as vaccine adjuvants5. The extensive experience now available with emulsion adjuvants in human vaccines attests to the efficacy and safety of this adjuvant platform, and emulsions are now being investigated in vaccines targeting SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-196,7,8,9,10. As a result, we have likely reached a major “tipping point”, supporting the extensive development and licensure of new vaccines containing emulsion adjuvants. In this context, it is timely to review the emulsion adjuvants currently included in licensed vaccines, i.e., MF59 and AS03 (and AF03, although this was never marketed). Here, we review how AS03 and M59 have been used to date, what we know about how they work, and the advantages that they bring.What is an emulsion adjuvant?An emulsion is a mixture of two or more liquids that are normally immiscible, stabilized by the presence of a surfactant. In an oil-in-water emulsion, the oil is the dispersed phase, in water. The most commonly used oil in human adjuvants is squalene, a naturally occurring molecule found in plants and animals, including humans, in whom it is essential for the production of cholesterol, steroid hormones, and vitamin D. Squalene is a component of all the major emulsion adjuvants (Table 1)11,12 and is currently derived from a natural source (shark liver oil), although alternative sources are being explored2 and advances have been made using both synthetic biology techniques13 and plant sources14,15. Squalene-based emulsions are currently mainly manufactured using microfluidizers or high-pressure homogenization. However, emulsions can be formulated using simpler techniques such as self-emulsification16. It is important to highlight that squalene alone is not an adjuvant, but emulsions of squalene combined with surfactants as stabilizers can form effective adjuvants when added to antigens. Emulsion adjuvants generally do not require any physical association with the antigen, although co-administration as a mixed formulation of the two concurrently is important to performance17,18. AS03 contains squalene and α-tocopherol (vitamin E), an immune potentiating component, whereas MF59 comprises squalene and surfactants only19. Vitamins such as vitamin E have been extensively used as immune supplements20,21, although little is known about their mechanisms of immunomodulation. Vitamins A, B, C, D, and E, have been tested in preclinical models either as immune supplements (administered separately to a vaccine) or as adjuvants22,23,24,25,26,27. Vitamin E is used as an adjuvant in some veterinary vaccines28,29,30,31 and was initially added to AS03 due to its anti-oxidant properties, to prevent squalene degradation, but it shows immuno-potentiating effects at higher concentrations18. In contrast to the successful track record observed with oil-in-water emulsions, water-in-oil emulsions have also been evaluated as vaccine adjuvants but have not achieved wide success, predominantly because they are much less well tolerated.Table 1 Composition of emulsion adjuvants.Full size tableLicensed emulsion adjuvantsMF59MF59 is an oil-in-water emulsion adjuvant that was first approved in Europe in 1997, in an improved influenza vaccine for adults aged 65 years and older; the adjuvanted vaccine showed enhanced functional antibody responses compared to non-adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccines32. Currently licensed in more than 30 countries, the improved effectiveness of the MF59-adjuvanted versus non-adjuvanted influenza vaccine in older adults was demonstrated in a large observational study of 170,000 adults aged 65 years and over. Vaccination of older adults with MF59-adjuvanted influenza vaccine resulted in a 25% reduction in the risk of hospitalization due to influenza and pneumonia, compared with an unadjuvanted influenza vaccine33. In 2017, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunization in the United Kingdom (UK) recommended that Fluad (Seqirus) should preferentially be given to subjects aged above 65, due to its established record of enhanced effectiveness34. In 2015, the same product was also licensed as Fluad in the United States (US) for use in older adults. Licensure was based on demonstrating serological non-inferiority to an already licensed influenza vaccine35, with evidence of superior effectiveness accumulating after licensure36.This has become a common approach to licensure in the US for next-generation influenza vaccines, including those that have the potential for superiority relative to the established vaccines. The first licensure can be obtained by showing non-inferiority versus a “standard” vaccine; then, any data to show superiority, usually involving effectiveness, can be obtained during post-licensure studies. This approach has also been adopted by other manufacturers, such as Sanofi for their high-dose vaccine for older adults, with a relative efficacy trial performed post-licensure37, and Novavax, with their matrix-M adjuvanted vaccine38.MF59 also has an acceptable safety profile in infants and young children and, compared with non-adjuvanted vaccines, significantly enhances immune responses against homologous and heterologous influenza virus strains39. MF59 adjuvant increased influenza vaccine efficacy from 43 to 89% in young children40 and is an effective adjuvant for influenza vaccines in this population41. Phase III studies of MF59 quadrivalent seasonal influenza vaccines in young children have been completed in Europe42 and are ongoing in the US (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT0134659243).MF59 also significantly improves the immunogenicity of pandemic influenza vaccines and has enabled vaccines to achieve neutralizing titers that would be expected to offer protection with lower antigen doses, and with potentially fewer doses, compared with non-adjuvanted vaccines5. The 2009 MF59-adjuvanted H1N1 influenza vaccine was approved in Europe for use in all persons aged 6 months and older. Approximately 100 million doses of the H1N1 pandemic vaccines containing MF59 (Focetria and Celtura, Novartis) were distributed commercially.AS03AS03 is an adjuvant system (AS) containing DL-α-tocopherol and squalene in an oil-in-water emulsion that was first developed with the aim of developing an improved influenza vaccine. However, the manufacturer, GSK, took a different approach to clinical development and committed to undertake a large phase III efficacy study in older adults. The trial was inspired by the confidence in the performance of the adjuvant based on earlier studies with avian H5N1 influenza44. This study (Influence65) was designed as a relative efficacy trial incorporating two consecutive influenza seasons and involving more than 40,000 adults ≥65 years of age, in stable health, located across 15 countries. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive influenza vaccine with AS03 or the same vaccine (Fluarix, GSK) without adjuvant45. All participants were then followed through two influenza seasons (2008/2009 and 2009/2010), with a primary endpoint based on the relative rates of RT-qPCR-confirmed influenza infection (nasal and throat swabs). Unfortunately, the study failed to meet its primary endpoint, and enhanced efficacy against influenza A and/or B infection was not demonstrated. The Influence65 study illustrated the challenges associated with influenza vaccine efficacy trials, which can be confounded by multiple circulating virus subtypes, year-to-year virus strain drifts, the unpredictable effects of previous vaccination and natural exposure, along with the inability to accurately predict transmission intensity. The biggest challenge for the Influence65 study was that it began just before an influenza pandemic, which meant that the data collected for one of the years was not evaluable for the main analysis. However, even though the primary endpoint was missed, clear benefits were observed in secondary and exploratory readouts. Specifically, efficacy against A/H3N2 influenza infection as well as all-cause mortality and pneumonia was demonstrated in a post hoc analysis45,46. Hence, although the Influence65 study did not support licensure, the study did highlight the potential benefits of an adjuvanted influenza vaccine for older adults, even during seasons with partially mismatched influenza strains. AS03-adjuvanted influenza vaccine subsequently showed enhanced relative efficacy against H1N1 pandemic influenza in young children compared with the non-adjuvanted vaccine47.The safety profile of the AS03-adjuvanted H1N1 pandemic vaccine produced in Europe (Pandemrix, GSK) was investigated following reports of narcolepsy in adolescents and children, primarily in Finland and Sweden48. Epidemiological studies revealed an increased risk of narcolepsy following vaccination with Pandemrix, with relative risk estimates ranging from 1.5 to 25.0 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.3–48.5) in children and from 1.1 to 18.8 (95% CI 0.6–207.4) in adults49. In 2013, an increased risk of narcolepsy was also reported in the absence of pandemic vaccination, e.g., in China, Taiwan, and several European countries50,51,52, suggesting a role for the circulating H1N1 influenza virus. One hypothesis for the apparent association between H1N1 and narcolepsy was that of “molecular mimicry”, whereby CD4+ T cells to influenza hemagglutinin antigen (HA) from H1N1 (from vaccine antigen or circulating virus) cross-reacted with hypocretin, a human neuropeptide hormone, triggering narcolepsy. This hypothesis is currently being evaluated using specific HLA-DQB1*06:02 tetramers, and preliminary data indicate that antigenic mimicry exists at the CD4+ T cell level53,54,55. While further evidence is needed, a CD4+ T cell-based mechanism54,56,57 would be consistent with the importance of the HLA-DQB1*06:02 allele and the existence of risk alleles in the T cell receptor58, and would support the lack of evidence for a direct role played by the AS03 adjuvant59. The involvement of antigen-specific immune responses was also suggested, based on findings using a transgenic mouse model in which HA was expressed in hypocretin-secreting neurons and in which adoptive transfer of HA-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells triggered narcolepsy-like symptoms60. Other studies have identified cross-reactive antibodies between influenza virus nucleoprotein and human hypocretin receptor 261, although several aspects of this work remain controversial62,63. A final report from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) following an evaluation of all available data stated that hypotheses involving a role for the antigens were more plausible than hypotheses based on a direct role of the adjuvant53.Since 2006, more than 55,000 participants have been vaccinated with at least one dose of an AS03-adjuvanted influenza vaccine in controlled clinical trials (~25,000 with pandemic and 30,000 with seasonal influenza vaccines). In addition, during the H1N1 influenza pandemic in 2009, more than 90 million doses of the AS03-adjuvanted H1N1 vaccine were administered worldwide49. Following authorization, extensive pharmacovigilance data was obtained and the outcomes of these data, including post-authorization safety studies, supported a favorable benefitisk profile for these vaccines in several populations.Summary of clinical exposure to AS03 and MF59Following the initial licensure of MF59 in an improved influenza vaccine in Europe in 1997, emulsion adjuvants continued to have a relatively low profile, with only a few million doses being administered each year in older adults. This changed dramatically during the 2009–2010 H1N1 influenza pandemic, with the distribution of a combined total of more than 190 million doses of vaccines formulated with emulsion adjuvants (MF59 and AS03)49,64.Evaluations of vaccine effectiveness have shown that adjuvanted influenza vaccines (including AS03 and MF59) are significantly more effective than non-adjuvanted vaccines in children65 and other populations. Moreover, extensive evaluations have consistently shown that MF59 and AS03 have acceptable safety profiles49,66,67,68. Across study groups comprising different populations (children, adults, and older adults), the most frequently reported adverse events following vaccination with AS03- or MF59-adjuvanted vaccines were injection-site pain, fatigue, headache, and muscle aches. Although more reactogenic than the comparable non-adjuvanted vaccines, most symptoms were generally mild to moderate in intensity and of short duration68,69,70.AS03 and MF59 have been widely used in licensed pandemic (H1N1) and pre-pandemic (H5N1) influenza vaccines, for stockpiling and preparedness. This widespread utilization followed demonstrations of the antigen-sparing capabilities, along with the induction of broad and potent immune responses with both AS03 and MF5932,68,71,72,73. In one study, MF59 and/or AS03 were administered with stockpiled H7N9 antigens to evaluate the potential of using one or the other of these adjuvants with a range of vaccines from different suppliers72. The study’s findings suggested that using adjuvants from different manufacturers with stockpiled influenza antigens was well tolerated and immunogenic. The ease of manufacturing emulsion adjuvants at scale has important ramifications when planning and implementing a rapid global response to a pandemic. Given the substantial clinical and post-licensure safety database, it is our view that emulsion adjuvants should continue to be considered the preferred adjuvants for influenza pandemic responses.AF03AF03 is an alternative oil-in-water emulsion adjuvant (Table 1). AF03 was licensed for use during the H1N1 pandemic in a vaccine called Humenza (Sanofi) but was never commercialized. Like other emulsion adjuvants, the AF03-adjuvanted influenza vaccine demonstrated antigen-sparing and induced a stronger immune response than the non-adjuvanted vaccine74. More recently, AF03 has been tested in a phase I/II clinical trial for the development of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine75. AF03 is manufactured using a unique approach that has been described in the literature76. AF03 also constitutes the delivery system for another emulsion adjuvant, AF04, which is a formulation including a synthetic molecule (E6020) that is claimed to mimic the performance of the natural product monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL). As previously observed with glucopyranosyl lipid adjuvant (GLA)-stable emulsion (SE) adjuvant, the TLR4 agonist E6020 synergizes with the emulsion to augment antibody and cellular immune responses in mice76,77. GLA and second-generation lipid adjuvant (SLA) are alternative synthetic MPL-like molecules that are also TLR4 agonists. GLA and SLA adjuvants are being evaluated in emulsion formulations (SE) in clinical trials of vaccines targeting tuberculosis, schistosomiasis, leishmaniasis, and leprosy; but they have also been evaluated in H5 influenza vaccines78,79.Emulsions under developmentThe composition of emulsions plays an important role in their performance, but an additional way to innovate is by advancing alternative approaches to manufacturing which may have advances for widespread distribution16,80. As described above, emulsions can also be used to deliver additional immune potentiators16, an approach that has been described for SE81,82. SE is an emulsion adjuvant originally developed by Edgar Ribi, but subsequently advanced by the Infectious Diseases Research Institute in the US. It is similar to MF59 but contains a lower squalene content, a phospholipid emulsifier, and low concentrations of α-tocopherol (0.01% v/v)83,84. SE was evaluated in clinical studies of pandemic H1N1 influenza but was never licensed. However, the manufacturing process for SE was successfully transferred to alternative sites to promote local vaccine production84, and innovations in its manufacturing have continued, with a view to the eventual global production of pandemic influenza vaccines7,85.In addition to those described above, Sepivac SWE, an alternative squalene-in-water (SWE) emulsion with the same composition as MF59, has been recently developed by researchers at Seppic and the Vaccine Formulation Institute in Switzerland; it is prepared at cGMP-grade and is being made available to the entire vaccine community under open-access terms. Sepivac SWE is currently under clinical evaluation in a seasonal influenza vaccine86 and in a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine7,87,88.CoVaccine HT (Soligenix Inc.) is an alternative adjuvant, which contains sucrose fatty acid esters formulated in sub-micron size squalane-in-water emulsions89. Squalane is completely saturated and is more resistant to oxidation than unsaturated squalene. However, little is known about the adjuvant activity or mechanism of action of CoVaccine HT, although it out-performed other adjuvants used for comparison, including SE/GLA-SE90. CoVaccine HT has also been evaluated in preclinical models for a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and showed improved immune responses when compared with Alum91.The mechanism of action of emulsion adjuvantsThe innate immune responseOil-in-water emulsions induce rapid recruitment of monocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, and dendritic cells (DCs) to the injection site and subsequently to the draining lymph node (dLN). Preclinical models suggest that cellular recruitment is most likely orchestrated by the induction of chemokines, which are upregulated following exposure to emulsions18,92. Within hours of being injected, emulsion adjuvants induce the recruitment of antigen-loaded monocytes and DCs to the dLN18,93, and they rapidly accumulate in the subcapsular region94,95. It has been proposed that the role these subcapsular sinus macrophages (SCMs) play in mediating adjuvanticity may differ according to the type of emulsion adjuvant administered. Emulsion adjuvants may promote the accumulation of unprocessed antigen trapped in immunocomplexes within SCMs, enhancing its subsequent deposition onto non-cognate B cells and then follicular DCs, as seen with MF5994. Overall, these data are consistent with the central role played by SCMs in promoting immunity following administration of adjuvanted vaccines96.In addition to mobilizing resident dLN cells, emulsion adjuvants have been shown to enhance the number of activated myeloid DCs in mouse LNs and activate human myeloid DCs in vitro18,94. The relative importance of the different myeloid cells in promoting immunity following immunization with emulsion adjuvants is yet to be determined. Very similar dynamics of innate immune activation in the lymph node have been described in nonhuman primates (NHPs) in comparison to mice for MF59, suggesting that the innate response to emulsion adjuvants is conserved across species97. Overall, the ability of emulsion adjuvants to activate innate immunity and to promote antigen uptake and presentation is likely to be central to the improved quality and quantity of the adaptive immune response observed for vaccines adjuvanted with emulsions (Fig. 1).Fig. 1: Mechanisms of action of oil-in-water emulsion-adjuvanted vaccines.Intramuscular injection of oil-in-water emulsion-adjuvanted vaccines generates an immunocompetent environment at the muscle injection site characterized by secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, induction of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMP)-signaling, and recruitment of innate immune cells such as neutrophils, eosinophils, dendritic cells, monocytes, and macrophages. Innate immune cells capture the antigen and migrate to the draining lymph node. Antigen and the emulsion adjuvant co-localize with subcapsular sinus macrophages right outside the B cell follicles, as well as with dendritic cells in the medulla. The antigen is transferred to the B cell follicles where germinal center B cells, helped by T follicular helper cells, undergo the processes of extensive somatic hypermutation and affinity maturation, and differentiate into plasmablasts or memory B cells. Antigen-loaded dendritic cells activate T cells which develop a mixed Th0/Th1/Th2 phenotype. Overall, these immunological mechanisms result in increased circulating vaccine-specific T cells, a broadly diverse repertoire of memory B cells as well as high titers of polyfunctional and cross-neutralizing serum antibodies.Full size imageAdaptive immune responseCentral to the innate–adaptive immune response axis is the enhanced induction of germinal centers (GC) and follicular helper T cells (TFHs) induced by emulsion adjuvants. MF59-adjuvanted vaccines induce high frequencies of TFHs in mice, resulting in improved formation of GCs and antigen-specific GC B cells, which can persist for at least 4 months98. Similar enhancement of antigen-specific B cell responses has been reported in young and aged mice99,100 and in infant and adult NHPs97,101. Similarly, AS03 promoted a strong TFH response in mice immunized with hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), via an IL-6-dependent mechanism102, and in NHPs immunized with a nanoparticle-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine7. GLA-SE was also shown to improve TFH responses95, but with a mechanism most likely resulting from the combined activity of the emulsion and the stimulation of TLR42,103,104. TFH induction by GLA-SE was independent of SCM activation, in contrast to humoral or Th1 responses, suggesting that multiple innate immune mechanisms are required for an optimal adaptive immune response to this adjuvant95. Additionally, although detailed kinetics of TFH and GC induction are not available for other emulsion adjuvants, GLA-SE induced TFH and GC formation faster than other non-emulsion adjuvants, resulting in the earlier differentiation of B cells into plasma cells105.In addition to inducing potent and persistent humoral responses, emulsion adjuvants also consistently induced strong CD4+ T helper cell responses in rodents18,95,106,107. The efficient induction of T and B cell differentiation by emulsion adjuvants results in potent antigen-specific and cross-protective humoral responses. For instance, multiple studies in ferrets have shown that AS03-adjuvanted influenza vaccines induce both heterologous and homologous antibody responses108,109.Emulsion adjuvant-induced transcription profiles MF59 Emulsion adjuvants activate multiple, distinct molecular pathways, and transcriptomics approaches have been used to shed some light on their molecular targets. The response to MF59 has been well characterized by applying microarray technology to evaluate the transcription profile at the injection site in mice. Mosca et al. demonstrated that MF59 targets muscle cells, which are activated to launch a complex pro-inflammatory response. While some of this response is shared with other adjuvants, such as CpG and Alum, the action of MF59 was more potent, resulting in the rapid recruitment of CD11b+ blood cells into muscle92. As the expression in muscle of genes that control leukocyte transendothelial migration was correlated with antigen-specific IgG titers in a mouse model of influenza vaccination, it is likely that MF59-mediated activation of muscle cells is important for downstream humoral responses110. Further studies by Vono et al. showed that MF59 induces the release of ATP from muscle cells111. ATP is released following cell damage and can serve as a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP), triggering the activation of immune cells via pattern recognition receptor (PRR) stimulation. However, the specific PRR(s) implicated in MF59 signaling have not yet been identified. MF59 does not activate Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in vitro, and MF59 adjuvanticity was preserved in knock-out mice whose macrophages lacked the ability to respond to cell damage (NLRP3−/− or caspase 1 −/− mice). However, MF59 adjuvanticity is dependent on the apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing CARD (ASC) adaptor protein, another inflammasome component112,113. MF59 adjuvanticity is mediated in vivo by MyD88, an adapter protein downstream of many TLRs, although the exact function of MyD88 signaling in MF59 adjuvanticity is yet to be elucidated. AS03 As with MF59, AS03 induces transcriptional changes at the injection site and the dLNs18. Morel et al. showed that AS03, like MF59, triggers the transient production of cytokines, leading to enhanced recruitment of granulocytes at the injection site, and dLNs, together with increased antigen-loaded monocytes in the dLNs18. Similar activity has been confirmed by transcriptomic analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in humans114,115. Studies with AS03 have shown that α-tocopherol is essential to enhance antigen loading in monocytes and granulocytes and support migration to the dLN18. As described for MF59, DAMP-mediated signaling seems to be important for AS03 adjuvanticity, specifically associated with changes in lipid cell metabolism102. A combination of gene expression analysis and shotgun lipidomics demonstrated that AS03 induced a rapid perturbation of lipid metabolism in monocytic cells, leading to endoplasmic reticulum stress, and activation of the unfolded protein response pathway, ultimately resulting in increased TFH responses and improved antibody avidity102. A distinct difference in the kinetics of the gene expression profile was recorded at the injection site and the dLN and, while a response in injected muscle was detected after 4 h, meaningful changes in the gene expression pathways linked to lipid metabolism were detected in the dLN as early as 2 h post-injection, suggesting spatiotemporal modulation of DAMP-mediated signaling following AS03 injection102. Lipid metabolism has also been implicated in the mechanism of action of MF59116; more broadly, the integration of metabolic stress signals has emerged as a critical path in the induction of enhanced responses to vaccination117,118 and may be generally important for lipid-rich adjuvants. Overall, although these findings do not identify direct molecular targets for emulsions, they point to an important role for DAMP-mediated signaling in the mechanisms of action for both MF59 and AS03. GLA-SE The molecular mechanism of action of GLA-SE is perhaps more clear than other emulsions, due to the inclusion of a TLR4 ligand. GLA-SE adjuvanticity is dependent on MyD88 and TRIF, both adapter molecules downstream of TLR4 activation119. In contrast to MF59111, GLA-SE adjuvanticity is dependent on interferon-alpha (IFNα) production in the dLN, presumably to trap cells by CD69 expression and to augment early innate IFNγ production by CD8+ T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. In parallel, GLA-SE induces the production of IL-12 in vivo, which synergizes with the effects of IFNα to promote the expression of the transcription factor T-bet and a Th1 commitment120. Transcriptomics analysis has shown that GLA-SE also induces a pro-inflammatory expression profile in the dLN, particularly centered around innate inflammation, phagocytosis, and innate immune cell migration105. Common themes and emulsion-specific immune enhancementCommon themes that emerge from the analysis of the mode of action of emulsion adjuvants are: (1) Rapid draining of the adjuvants from the muscle to the dLN, with no evidence of a “depot effect”; (2) rapid, coordinated, and potent activation of innate immune cells in the dLN; (3) increased induction of CD4+ T cells, TFHs, and GCs, resulting in a humoral immune response of enhanced quantity and quality; and (4) a complex pattern of DAMP-mediated PRR activation. Despite these common pathways, each adjuvant differs in its specific immune induction profile. As different patterns of PRR expression emerge in different innate immune cells, the activation by multiple DAMPs in emulsion adjuvants will involve different signal integration patterns, resulting in a complex inflammatory milieu.MF59 directly activates muscle cells to induce multiple inflammatory and host defense transcriptional pathways at the injection site92,110,111 (Fig. 1). AS03 appears to clear more rapidly from the injection site into the dLN than MF59, a feature that has been associated with more potent induction of immune responses121,122. For example, AS03 was more potent in comparison with MF59 for an H7N9 influenza vaccine in man72. This is likely due to the additional immune potentiating effect of AS03, due to the inclusion of α-tocopherol, which was also highlighted in a study involving NHPs7, which compared AS03 with SWE for a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.Knudsen et al. compared MF59 and GLA-SE together with three other adjuvants (Alum, CAF01, and IC31), using different antigens and standardized protocols to test immunogenicity and protection in models of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, influenza, and chlamydia in mice123. Each adjuvant induced a unique “immunological signature” in each model, highlighting the importance of adjuvants in “skewing” the adaptive immune responses. MF59 and GLA-SE both induced strong antibody responses, with MF59 inducing more potent hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titers in the influenza model. MF59 resulted in a mixed Th1/Th2 cellular response, while GLA-SE induced a more consistent Th1 bias across the different models and resulted in better protection against chlamydia, with both adjuvants reducing bacterial burden upon challenge with M. tuberculosis. Although designing head-to-head studies is challenging because of uncertainties regarding dose and scheduling comparisons, studies such as this are invaluable tools to help understand the potential of different adjuvants and to optimally implement the approaches available.Immunological features of emulsion adjuvants in humansMF59 and AS03-adjuvanted influenza vaccines induce high titers of functional antibodies against endemic and pandemic influenza viruses in different populations, including children and older adults. Some head-to-head comparisons of MF59 and AS03-adjuvanted vaccines have been conducted, with AS03 consistently inducing the higher titers72,124. While HA-specific antibodies are crucial in inducing protection against influenza infection, T cells also play a critical function in promoting effector functions to limit infection, including the killing of infected target cells and orchestration of B cell responses. Both AS03 and MF59 are able to induce potent, multifunctional, and long-lasting CD4+ T cell responses following influenza immunization69,71,125,126,127,128,129. The induction of enhanced TFH responses has been demonstrated in humans for MF59-adjuvanted vaccines, and this increase was associated with improved antibody responses128. Similar results were obtained in NHPs for an AS03-adjuvanted SARS-CoV-2 vaccine7,130.A consistent signature pattern of early post-vaccine activation of myeloid and lymphoid cells following administration of emulsion adjuvants has emerged across multiple studies in humans. Many of these data are also consistent with findings from animal models, highlighting that emulsion adjuvant-mediated immune effects are conserved across species. In both children and adults vaccinated with MF59-adjuvanted influenza vaccine, vaccination induced the expression of multiple innate immune activation transcriptional modules, suggesting the activation of monocytes, DCs, and neutrophils, as well as a strong antiviral IFN signature at day 1 post-immunization131. The early induction of IFN and IFN-related cytokines, such as IP-10, has also been observed with AS03 in influenza vaccine studies, and this correlated with the induction of humoral responses. Similarly, activation of myeloid and lymphoid cells 1-day post-vaccination was observed with AS03-adjuvanted vaccines115,132,133,134.Cross-protectionMost influenza viruses differ in the globular head of their surface protein, HA, while the stem region is quite conserved across different strains. Therefore, humans often have preexisting immunity against HA stem epitopes. This represents a major challenge for the design of pandemic influenza vaccines because, after a lifetime of repeated exposures (through seasonal infections or vaccines), adults have an enriched pool of stem-specific memory B cells that can give rise to suboptimal responses when encountering new pandemic mutants. It is possible that a similar scenario will occur in the medium- to the long-term phase of the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Indeed, given current trends, most of the global population will have developed, either through infection or vaccination, immunity against SARS-CoV-2, while still facing the threat of the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 mutants. Emulsion adjuvants have been shown to be particularly useful in the development of vaccines against emerging viral mutants. MF59 and AS03-adjuvanted vaccines are characterized by the induction of cross-binding and cross-neutralizing antibodies with improved avidity, in addition to an expanded antibody repertoire, when compared with non-adjuvanted vaccines. Using a phage display approach to track the specificity of HA-specific antibody responses following vaccination, Khurana et al. showed that MF59 selectively enhanced antibody responses to the HA globular head, relative to the more conserved HA stem domain, as well as inducing a more diverse antibody repertoire135,136. Compared with the unadjuvanted vaccine, MF59 also induced expanded frequencies of memory B cells and improved affinity maturation, especially in immunologically naïve individuals, such as young children125,136. The characterization of serum antibody responses has confirmed the unique ability of MF59 to induce antibody diversity and cross-neutralizing responses against multiple clades of H5N1 and H1N1137,138. Similar immune features were observed in clinical studies with AS03-adjuvanted vaccines. In a study assessing the impact of seasonal vaccination on the immune responses to an AS03-adjuvanted H1N1 pandemic influenza vaccine, AS03 induced increased levels of vaccine-homologous and -heterologous hemagglutinin-inhibition (HI) and -neutralizing antibodies, homologous memory B cells, and plasmablasts, compared with non-adjuvanted vaccines139. Using the phage display approach described earlier, Khurana et al. showed that an AS03-adjuvanted H5N1 pandemic vaccine induced antibody epitope diversity to HA, with an enriched repertoire toward the HA globular head, which correlated with neutralization titers against both vaccine and heterologous H5N1 strains140. In a more recent study, a HA microarray was used to directly compare the cross-binding antibody responses induced by AS03 and MF59; both adjuvants induced increased broad homo- and hetero-subtypic HA responses, with AS03 achieving a higher titer and greater breadth of IgG responses relative to MF59141. In addition, both MF59 and AS03-adjuvanted vaccines resulted in robust HA-specific antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC)-mediating antibodies against antigenically drifted H7N9 viruses142. A meta-analysis of available data showed that oil-in-water adjuvanted H5N1 influenza vaccines induced cross-clade reactive antibodies, although the results varied depending on the serological assay used (HAI, MN, or SRH)143. Given their unique ability to shape the antibody repertoire against viral mutants, emulsion adjuvants would appear to represent a key asset in the design of viral pandemic vaccines.Several research groups have provided key insights to explain how emulsion adjuvants can achieve a broad and functional antibody diversity, revealing that these adjuvants use a bimodal mechanism. Emulsion adjuvants appear to induce the activation of naïve B cell responses against new epitopes of viral mutants combined with the re-activation of preexisting memory B cells, which further improves their affinity toward previously encountered epitopes (Fig. 2). In a study by Galson et al., the authors investigated the effect of AS03 adjuvant on the plasma cell repertoire following H1N1 influenza vaccination in individuals previously vaccinated with a seasonal influenza vaccine144. By analyzing mutation levels in the heavy chain variable region of the B cell receptor, they were able to distinguish sequences from cells that had been recently activated from naïve B cells, from those that were activated by memory recall, showing the combined activation of vaccine-specific naïve and memory B cells. First, AS03 stimulates increased activation of naïve B cells, thus reducing immune interference with previous vaccine responses; second, it increases the adaptability of the recalled cells to give improved specificity to the new vaccine antigen, probably through further rounds of GC reactions145. Ellebedy et al. reported similar findings for an AS03-adjuvanted H5N1 vaccine, providing insights into the temporal dynamics of B cell responses following a first or second vaccination146. The immune response to the first dose was exclusively directed at the conserved HA stem region and came from memory B cells developed through a history of seasonal vaccinations or infections; monoclonal antibodies from these memory B cells had increased levels of somatic hypermutation and recognized multiple influenza strains. The immune response following the second dose was characterized by plasmablasts with a low level of somatic hypermutation that were specific to the HA head region of the pandemic H5N1 variant, indicating that these had been recruited from a pool of naïve B cells. Importantly, the antibody response to the H5 HA stem region was much lower after the second immunization, most likely because of the blocking of these epitopes by stem-specific antibodies induced by the first immunization. Together, these data showed that emulsion adjuvants substantially increase antibody responses in humans by effectively recruiting preexisting memory B cells as well as naïve B cells to the response. Furthermore, by shaping the B cell responses toward a more diverse antibody repertoire, emulsion adjuvants may overcome the negative effect of less-functional preexisting antibodies. Consistent with the improved selection of B cells, the AS03-adjuvanted hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccine induced superior titers of high affinity antibodies, and achieved an overall better affinity maturation than the Alum-adjuvanted vaccine in a clinical trial involving naïve adults. The same study demonstrated that AS03, similar to other adjuvant systems except for Alum, improved memory B cell quality and persistence147. All of these immune properties are particularly desirable in a pandemic vaccine to counter the worldwide spread of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.Fig. 2: Emulsion adjuvants promote functional antibody responses against pandemic variants.An history of infection or vaccinations leads to an enrichment of circulating memory B cells that are specific toward conserved but subdominant viral epitopes. Conventional vaccination strategies aim at eliciting these memory B cells that will differentiate into plasmablasts and secrete high affinity antibodies after antigen reencounter but only against epitopes for which they had some specificity; these antibodies are typically able to prevent infection by one or few closely related viral mutants but not by very diverse mutants. By contrast, vaccination with emulsion-adjuvanted vaccines shapes the antibody responses in two ways: first preexisting memory B cells re-activate and undergo new rounds of germinal center reactions, further improving their antigenic affinity. Secondly, new naïve B cells targeting viral variants are recruited into the responses and also undergo germinal center reactions and differentiate into plasmablasts that secrete antibodies against new viral epitopes. The resulting effect is greater antibody diversity and higher overall quality of the antibody and B cell responses that are able to prevent infection by multiple and diverse viral mutants.Full size imageSystems serology analyses of the induced antibody Fc functionalities have further revealed the serological fingerprints of emulsion adjuvants, providing key insights into the mechanisms of antibody-mediated immune cell engagement and clearance of infection. Systems serology comprises a combination of high-throughput experimental techniques aimed at dissecting antibody features and functions, followed by a range of computational methods to help mine and provide an understanding of the profiled antibodies at an unprecedented depth148. By applying systems serology, shared serological features associated with emulsion adjuvants have been identified in human and NHP studies (Fig. 3). AS03 and MF59 induce a high degree of antibody polyfunctionality, characterized by changes in the antibody Fc glycan chain and the binding to Fc receptors, as well as in the ability of vaccine-specific antibodies to selectively recruit innate immune cells. In two separate NHP studies with MF59-adjuvanted HIV vaccines, MF59 was shown to modulate antibody Fc glycoprofiles, leading to the enrichment of sialylated vaccine-specific IgG antibodies149,150. Remarkably, sialylated antibodies promote enhanced immune complex deposition in GCs through complement proteins or Fc receptors, leading to the maturation of B cells with increased affinity151,152. These findings suggest that sialylated antibodies could play a role in mechanisms through which emulsion adjuvants modulate B cell responses and trigger repertoire diversification.Fig. 3: Serological barcode of oil-in-water emulsion adjuvants.The antibody responses to emulsion-adjuvanted vaccines possess peculiarities that constitute a serological fingerprint of emulsion adjuvants. As observed across multiple species and in combination with different vaccine antigens, emulsions induce high antibody titers, with a broad repertoire and a cross-neutralizing activity against multiple antigenic variants. Furthermore, systems serology analysis of serum vaccine-specific antibodies in human have revealed new important features of Fc-mediated polyfunctionality. Emulsion adjuvants modulate the Fc glycan chain of serum IgGs, induce antibodies that better bind to Fcγ receptors, and increase Fc-mediated activation of innate immune cells, including neutrophils, monocytes, and natural killer cells. Fc fragment crystallizable region, FcγR fragment crystallizable receptor for IgG, FcγRIIA Fc receptor IIA for IgG.Full size imageUsing systems serology, Boudreau et al. assessed changes in antibody functional profiles in individuals who received H5N1 avian influenza vaccine administered with MF59, with Alum, or without adjuvant153. As observed in NHPs, MF59 elicited antibody responses with better binding to FcγRIIA and stimulated robust neutrophil phagocytosis and complement activity. AS03 also induced a broad spectrum of antibody functionalities, dominated by features such as the activation of phagocytosis by innate cells and of NK cell-related responses. This correlates well with the fact that IFN- and NK cell-related blood transcriptional responses were detected in the same clinical trial115. Notably, MF59-driven responses lacked NK cell and monocyte phagocytic features, hinting at the potential role of differential activation of Fc functions by different emulsion adjuvants. Overall, these findings point to a combination of selected serological features that represent a distinctive fingerprint of emulsion adjuvants.Emulsion adjuvants and the SARS-CoV-2 pandemicThe accumulated experience with emulsion adjuvants, including vaccine effectiveness, induction of cross-protective immune responses, extensive documentation of the safety profile, and ease of manufacture, including rapid scale-up, has served to highlight the potential of emulsion adjuvants for vaccine development in response to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Emulsion adjuvants were previously used in the preclinical evaluation of a MERS-CoV vaccine (MF59)154 and a SARS-CoV-1 vaccine (AS03)155. In addition, Addavax (InvivoGen), a commercially available adjuvant that has the same composition as MF59, was used in the assessment of multiple SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in mice, guinea pigs, and ferrets156,157,158,159,160.Efforts to develop a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine have centered around the spike protein antigen, delivered in a wild-type or stabilized form with RNA or adenovirus platforms, or as an adjuvanted recombinant protein. Both MF59 and AS03 are currently being evaluated in investigational SARS-CoV-2 pandemic vaccines. MF59 was initially tested with a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein stabilized by a “clamp” in a pre-fusion conformation. While the vaccine elicited strong immune responses and had a promising safety profile, the study was halted because the clamp antigen led to interference with diagnostic assays for HIV, a possible barrier to the widespread use of the vaccine161. More recently, a phase I/II clinical trial has begun to assess the safety and efficacy of IVX-411, a new, MF59-adjuvanted SARS-CoV-2 vaccine that uses a self-assembling nanoparticle with a multicopy display of the spike glycoprotein receptor-binding domain162. AS03 is also being tested in preclinical models of SARS-CoV-2 infection and in clinical studies. In a study by Liang et al., AS03 induced robust, high-level induction of both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses to a native-like trimeric subunit vaccine candidate for SARS-CoV-2 in rodents and NHPs163. In a separate study investigating the efficacy of soluble pre-fusion-stabilized spike trimer in NHPs, AS03 was critical for the induction of high-magnitude spike-specific IgG, neutralization titers, and IgA and IgG B cell responses8. AS03 enhanced the quality of the response, supporting the production of antibodies that mediated enhanced Fc functions. Soluble spike trimers formulated with AS03 induced a mixed CD4+ T cell response comprising Th0, Th2, and TFH. Post-challenge with SARS-CoV-2, vaccinated monkeys developed a vaccine-induced response in the lung that was able to control the infection before a significant primary T cell response could be generated. Lung mucosal IgG levels increased rapidly in vaccinated animals, as early as day 2 post-challenge, resulting in a reduction of viral replication in both the upper and lower airways. Animals receiving the highest dose of vaccine were protected from infection by day 48. In a model of passive immunization, vaccine-induced IgG antibodies were sufficient to protect hamsters from the SARS-CoV-2 challenge8.The value of AS03 to induce potent immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 was highlighted in a head-to-head evaluation of AS03, SWE, AS37 (TLR7 agonist absorbed to Alum), CpG1018-Alum (TLR9 agonist with Alum), and Alum adjuvants, combined with a structurally designed nanoparticle SARS-CoV-2 antigen (RBD-NP, the spike protein receptor-binding domain displayed on a two-component protein nanoparticle) in a nonhuman primate study7. While all five adjuvants induced neutralizing antibodies and CD4+ T cell responses following two immunizations, AS03 induced the highest neutralization titers and CD4+ T cell responses, which were once again “mixed” in profile, including mostly IL-2- and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α-producing cells, and TFHs. Neutralizing titers were also measured against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. While AS03-, AS37-, and CpG-Alum-adjuvanted vaccines all induced neutralizing antibodies against the B1.1.17 and B.1.351 variants, the AS03 group induced the highest neutralizing titer. None of the animals in the AS03 group that were challenged with SARS-CoV-2 had detectable viral RNA in pharyngeal swabs at any time, and only one animal had detectable viral RNA in nasal swabs, at very low levels. In contrast, at least one animal in all the other vaccination groups had detectable viral RNA in both pharyngeal and nasal swabs. Animals in all vaccinated groups had undetectable viral loads in their bronchoalveolar lavage. Although the number of animals per group was relatively small (n = 5 per group), these data suggested that uniquely among the adjuvants tested, AS03 provided protection from challenge in both the upper and lower respiratory tract. Systems serology analysis showed that all adjuvants improved the ability of antigen-specific antibodies to mediate effector functions, yet each adjuvant group mounted a distinct profile of antibody response that correlated somewhat differently with protection against the virus. For AS03 in particular, the best correlation at day 2 was found for neutralizing and binding antibodies; spike-specific IgG4, IgG2, IgG3, and IgA titers; and antibody-dependent neutrophil phagocytosis. Antibody-dependent neutrophil phagocytosis correlated with protection for SWE in this study, which had previously emerged as a key feature of the response to MF59-adjuvanted influenza vaccination153, raising the possibility that different emulsion adjuvants may share the ability to promote this effector function via the induction of antigen-specific antibodies. Otherwise, SWE and AS03 behaved quite differently in terms of the quality of the response induced, along with potency and efficacy, suggesting that key features of AS03 beyond the presence of squalene in the formulation mediate its functions. As discussed previously, AS03 is unique among the emulsion adjuvants in containing a significant dose of the immune potentiator α-tocopherol.Innate immune training to complement vaccine-specific responses“Trained immunity” is the ability of innate immune cells to acquire memory-like capabilities following stimulation and has recently emerged as a key feature of the overall immune response against infection164. Trained immunity is also likely to be involved in the nonspecific protective effects of live attenuated vaccines, such as Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) and measles165. The capacity of adjuvanted vaccines to induce trained immunity has yet to be fully understood.The induction of trained immunity by BCG relies on two pillars: (1) The vaccine induces strong activation of innate immunity and (2) also induces distinct epigenetic and metabolic reprogramming. Vaccination with emulsion adjuvants also results in profound changes in the innate immune cell compartment. In addition, alongside the evidence from animal models, several investigations in humans have highlighted the central role played by innate immunity in the response to emulsion-adjuvanted-vaccines, and a consistent signature of early activation of myeloid and lymphoid cells following vaccination has emerged. Additionally, an early (24 h) IFN response was observed in several studies using emulsion adjuvants and is often correlated with the later adaptive immune response115,132,133,134. Both type I and type II interferons have been shown to induce lasting and specific transcriptional memory in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, HeLa cells, and macrophages in vitro166,167. The totality of information known about the mechanism of action of emulsion adjuvants points to strong activation of innate immunity in humans, with some evidence supporting a role for emulsion adjuvants in modulating the epigenomic and metabolic profile of innate immune cells. Lipidomic analysis of the responses to an AS03-adjuvanted vaccine in mice hints at a role for metabolic reprogramming in its mode of action, involving pathways central to the induction of trained immunity102,164. Wimmers and colleagues directly assessed the effect of vaccination with the AS03-adjuvanted pandemic influenza vaccine on the epigenomic landscape of innate immune cells168. Similar to a trivalent inactivated vaccine, the AS03-adjuvanted H5N1 vaccine induced persistent epigenetic changes, resulting in reduced accessibility to AP-1 targeted loci and impaired cytokine response to TLR stimulation. However, in contrast to seasonal influenza vaccination, AS03-H5N1 increased the accessibility of IFN response factor loci, resulting in elevated type 1 IFN production and increased cellular resistance to viral infection in vitro. These data support the hypothesis that vaccines adjuvanted with emulsion adjuvants, and AS03-adjuvanted vaccines, in particular, can promote trained immunity. However, some crucial pieces of evidence are still missing. First, the nonspecific protective effects of adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted subunit vaccines are yet to be investigated. Post hoc analyses of the Influence65 study showed the efficacy of the AS03-adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccine against all-cause death and pneumonia. The cause of these effects has been debated46, but they could at least in part be explained by the induction of trained immunity. Overall, the findings of several studies suggest that vaccines adjuvanted with emulsion adjuvants could cause a persistent change to the metabolic and epigenomic status of innate immune cells, leading to trained immunity. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved remain to be elucidated and any clinical effects of such changes assessed in clinical trials.Emulsion adjuvants are invaluable “tools” to enable investigations into human immunityGiven the limitations of animal models in replicating human immune responses169,170, licensed vaccines provide a unique opportunity to better understand human immunity, since they can be used to probe the immune system of healthy individuals. Increased emphasis by regulatory authorities to understand the mechanisms of action of novel adjuvants, combined with the availability of advanced immunological readouts and -omics technologies, has enabled an unprecedented and deep scientific inquiry into the kinetics and mechanisms of the innate and adaptive immune responses that are enhanced in the presence of adjuvants. In this context, licensed adjuvanted vaccines should be considered, beyond their role in public health, as experimental tools with which to address fundamental questions about the interactions between innate and adaptive immunity. The development of noninvasive monitoring techniques, such as high-resolution positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scanning using tissue-specific and nonspecific radioligands and deuterium labeling of proliferating cells, allows direct in vivo or ex vivo monitoring of the nascent immune response following vaccination. For example, an exploratory PET/CT scanning study of recipients of an MF59-adjuvanted vaccine was able to recapitulate known features of the immune response to vaccination171. Biopsies of muscle and lymph node tissue following immunization can be done more efficiently by using radiological guidance to identify activated lymph nodes171,172. Non-live vaccines such as emulsion adjuvants can be used safely in immunocompromised patients and older adults173 and could provide a platform for exploratory trials in patients with specific deficiencies of the immune system. In these individuals, adjuvanted vaccines could be a safe proxy for infection or, more generally, immune activation, enabling the dissection of specific facets of the immune response in vivo. An-omics approach to such trials could provide insights into important immune functions, even in small trials, particularly if machine learning approaches adapted to longitudinal studies—which can reduce the impact of interindividual variability—were applied.Vaccination of healthy individuals is also being used to interrogate relationships between immunogenicity and reactogenicity and to understand why and how adverse reactions to vaccines occur. Orthogonal experimental techniques could be combined to define individuals who experience post-vaccine reactions, which could then be validated prospectively. For instance, -omics techniques were able to identify correlates of general but not local adverse events following AS03-adjuvanted immunization134,174. These in vivo approaches could be complemented by ex vivo model systems to accelerate and de-risk vaccine development175. Additionally, more objective and precise measurements of local and systemic reactogenicity than participant-recorded diary cards could improve clinical monitoring and correlates analysis, as recently demonstrated for MF59-adjuvanted influenza vaccine171.Emulsion adjuvants are a versatile adjuvant approach for vaccine developmentThe accumulated evidence that we have presented here establishes that emulsion adjuvants are the best approach to take to improve influenza vaccines, including for pandemic influenza. However, there is also a considerable body of clinical evidence to suggest that emulsion adjuvants have great potential to be safe and effective adjuvants for a range of different vaccines. In an early study with a recombinant antigen (HBsAg), MF59 was shown to enable the creation of a two-dose vaccine against HBV176, an approach that was subsequently commercialized using an alternative adjuvant, CpG177. In addition, MF59 was used to show that a recombinant protein (gB) vaccine against cytomegalovirus (CMV) had significant efficacy in a phase II trial and offered protection against infection in 50% of the maternal population evaluated178. However, the HBV and CMV vaccines adjuvanted by MF59 were never commercialized, in common with several other vaccines that were evaluated in the clinic and showed good potency, along with an encouraging safety profile5. In addition, AS03 has also been evaluated in the clinic with a number of vaccines, including vaccines based on recombinant proteins and on the whole virus, and has repeatedly exhibited an excellent safety and tolerability profile, along with enhanced immune responses49. Hence, the use of emulsion adjuvants in licensed products179 and in a range of ongoing clinical evaluations6 highlights that they are a practical and attractive solution for the current pandemic.Pathways to licensureAdjuvants contain immune stimulants and are designed to enhance the immunogenicity and efficacy of vaccines. However, theoretical concerns that the immune-stimulatory activity of adjuvants could induce or exacerbate immune-mediated diseases in susceptible individuals triggered the development of new guidelines and standardized safety monitoring by regulatory authorities and manufacturers, who were seeking to comprehensively characterize the safety profile of adjuvanted vaccines180,181,182. Regulatory guidelines issued by the World Health Organization and EMA now require that the mechanism of action of novel adjuvants on the immune response be understood as part of licensure requirements182,183. Authorities require the assessment of potential immune-mediated toxicity and adverse events of special interest, such as neuroinflammatory, musculoskeletal, connective tissue, and gastrointestinal disease. To this end, manufacturers have moved toward greater standardization of clinical safety monitoring, with the development of specific tools and guidelines to ensure comprehensive data capture180,181.Although the current pandemic has created both the need and the opportunity for additional adjuvants to advance quickly through clinical evaluations, only Matrix-M has been so far approved for Emergency Use Authorization in Indonesia184 and appears close to an initial Emergency Use Authorization from the WHO. CpG1018 from Dynavax is in late-stage clinical evaluations, usually in combination with Alum, for several vaccine candidates185,186, while a very new adjuvant candidate, a novel TLR7/8 agonist, is being used in a product in India and appears likely to be part of the COVAX initiative for wider vaccine distribution187. However, based on the accumulated evidence we have summarized here, we believe that emulsion adjuvants have a much more established record of safety and high performance, due to their already extensive use in human vaccines. To summarize, this includes: (1) The inclusion of an emulsion adjuvant in a licensed product in Europe for more than 20 years; (2) the extensive use of emulsion adjuvants worldwide during a previous pandemic, i.e., the H1N1 influenza pandemic in 2009 (~200 million doses administered to diverse populations); (3) the extensive accumulated safety database over decades of use, as a consequence of (1) and (2), above; and (4) the many insights that have come from translational medicine studies in humans, which have closely interrogated the mechanism of action of emulsion adjuvants and have generally confirmed what we have learned from animal studies, while also highlighting additional opportunities to exploit the potential of emulsion adjuvants. Importantly, the manufacture of emulsion adjuvants has been shown to be robust and stable, with GSK able to commit to potentially producing 1 billion doses in 2021188. Moreover, it has been established through the stockpile approach of the US government as part of their influenza pandemic preparations that emulsion adjuvants can be successfully mixed with vaccine antigens from different manufacturers without impairing the performance of the vaccine candidate124. This capability of scale, along with a robust approach to flexible combinations, will likely be key to overcoming the challenges of the current pandemic.ConclusionsEmulsion adjuvants are well established and are included in licensed influenza vaccines. The safety profile of emulsion-adjuvanted vaccines has been thoroughly characterized, their potency and efficacy are better than that of non-adjuvanted vaccines, they allow dose sparing, and they can be manufactured at a large scale in response to increased demand. Emulsions are effective adjuvants in humans when combined with a range of antigens and have become the adjuvant of choice for influenza vaccines, including for pandemic responses. They consistently demonstrate the ability to induce a broad immune response against homologous and heterologous viral strains. As a consequence of these features, emulsion adjuvants are now being investigated for inclusion in protein-based vaccines as part of the medium- to long-term response to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Emulsion adjuvants are capable of meeting the needs of a pandemic response that necessitates minimizing antigen content and maximizing vaccine doses (dose sparing), along with a rapid and robust manufacturing process. Emulsion adjuvants can be easily combined with recombinant proteins, engineered nanoparticles, and whole inactivated viruses, although the impact on antigen integrity needs to be monitored on a case-by-case basis. MF59- and AS03-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are now moving into the late stages of development7,9,162,189,190. Emulsion-adjuvanted SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are therefore expected to form a major part of the solution to the global pandemic.In the context of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, where the antigenic shift is evident, the potential for emulsion adjuvants to induce a broad, potentially cross-protective immune response could provide considerable advantages, and will continue to be closely monitored. While initial data are encouraging191, careful evaluation of the immune response induced by emulsion-adjuvanted vaccines relative to alternative vaccine approaches will be needed moving forward. The ability to design optimal antigenic structures through protein engineering will also be critical for success7,192. Two decades of global experience using emulsion adjuvants, including their key role in managing an influenza pandemic, provide a solid foundation on which to build a platform of emulsion-adjuvanted vaccines. Because of their long history of safe use in humans and their known mode of action, emulsion adjuvants represent a benchmark for the development of novel vaccine adjuvants. Emulsion adjuvants are likely to remain the preferred adjuvant for pandemic responses, including pandemics caused by influenza and other emerging pathogens.

FAO procured the items including 1 desktop computer and printer, 3 laptops and 15 android tablets through an FAO funded Technical Cooperation Programme (TCP) titled “Integrated National Emergency Response to Avian Influenza in The Gambia”. The motorcycles are meant to strengthen extension service delivery and disease surveillance at border posts whilst the IT equipment are meant to enhance data collection and reporting. Mr. Mustapha Ceesay, Assistant FAO Representative and Head of Programmes handed over the items to Mr. Abdou Ceesay, Director General, DLS at a brief ceremony at the Department’s Complex in Abuko. In his statement, Mustapha Ceesay said the TCP is one of the areas through which FAO assists the Member States to build capacities for improved delivery for food and agriculture and meet the Sustainable Development Goals.. He noted that the hand-over aimed at strengthening the capacity of the DLS for effective service delivery and safeguarding public health, livelihoods, food security and nutrition in the Gambia. . He explained that the TCP titled “Integrated National Emergency Response to Avian Influenza in The Gambia” has a budget of GMD 12 million. The TCP addresses the FAO Country Programming Framework and the National Development Plan (NDP) Outcome 3.2: Value chains enhanced for Agriculture and Livestock Transformation; Outcome 11.2: Emergency and Disaster Risk Reduction and Response strengthened at all levels as well as the NDP Result Area 2: Increased livestock production for food self-sufficiency in animal and animal products. “FAO hopes that the intervention will enable the country to fully prepare against the highly infectious and deadly avian influenza ravaging the poultry industry and livelihoods across the world,” Mr. Ceesay said. “The TCP has supported mass public awareness activities across the country. It has also facilitated a study tour to neighbouring Senegal by the staff of the DLS to help strengthen their capacities.” For his part, Mr. Abdou Ceesay expressed profound appreciation and gratitude to FAO on behalf of the Ministry of Agriculture for the gesture. He described the TCP as timely, noting that FAO remains a true and consistent partner and supporter of the Ministry of Agriculture and his Department. He explained that through the TCP’s support, poultry farmers and stakeholders across the country have been sensitized on the prevention, control and management of Avian Influenza and to strengthen the risk management of the poultry value chain. “The motorbikes and IT equipment will help enhance the surveillance and reporting on all transboundary diseases,” he said expressing optimism that the intervention will contribute to the successful implementation of the project activities. “Mobility and accurate and timely data are key to the attainment of the project objective and we will make sure that the donated items are utilized effectively for the intended purpose”. Project Background The Gambia has endorsed the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially SDG 2 “End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture” and is thus highly committed to addressing the food and nutrition challenges.. The poultry industry provides employment opportunities to address food and nutrition insecurity.. Increased poultry production and productivity provide a platform for youth and women employment, income generation, poverty reduction and attainment of food self-sufficiency. National imports for poultry products in 2018 and 2019 stood at 20 928 and 429 525 Mt respectively for chicken meat, while eggs stood at 5 368 Mt and 79 011 Mt respectively. There may be a market dependency on imports because of limitations in national production capacity in terms of infrastructure and the high cost of production inputs, and the high mortality of chicks. To improve their livelihood status more support is required for, routine disease control such as for the highly pathogenic Avian Influenza and other veterinary services, inputs, advisory and training. In January 2021, the Ministry of Agriculture and the National Disaster Management Agency (NDMA) announced the outbreak of the highly pathogenic Avian Influenza (bird flu) H5N1 in the neighbouring Republic of Senegal. This led to a national ban on the import of poultry and poultry products to prevent the spread of the disease in the country. To address the issue, which is a threat to national food security, the country constituted a National Working Group on poultry and poultry products. The body comprises the Ministry of Agriculture, the Department of Livestock Services, the Gambia Livestock Marketing Agency, the National Poultry Cooperative, the National Livestock Owners Association, the Young Poultry Farmers Association and the Ministry of Trade, Industries and Employment. The Ministry of Agriculture also solicited support from FAO through a TCP to support national preparedness to respond to the emergency.

Ohio Ohio Health breaks down flu cases in Ohio by: Kenya Ramirez Posted: Dec 20, 2021 / 11:45 AM EST Updated: Dec 20, 2021 / 11:52 AM EST by: Kenya Ramirez Posted: Dec 20, 2021 / 11:45 AM EST Updated: Dec 20, 2021 / 11:52 AM EST SHARE COLUMBUS, Ohio (WCMH) – As COVID-19 cases rise in Ohio, doctors are also concerned about another illness that comes around this time of the year—the flu. Infectious Disease Specialist, Dr. Joseph Gastaldo, says he usually doesn’t see flu-related hospitalizations until late January or February. However, this year that’s all changed. He says many of these confirmed flu cases are coming from students. Hits ‘keep coming’: Hospitals struggle as COVID beds fill “In our country, we are seeing some unusual outbreaks of Influenza A at college campuses. University of Michigan during the big game was going through a major outbreak of Influenza A,” he said. Dr. Gastaldo says it’s the type of flu strain that has the potential to lead to more hospitalizations. “The CDC is reporting that most of what we’re seeing us influenza A type H3N2,” he said. “In previous years, when we have seen that that usually correlates with a significant hospitalization season in influenza.” Staff shortages hit medical centers as COVID-19, flu cases increase As of this week, the state of Ohio is seeing more than 70 flu cases. A number they normally don’t see in the month of December. “As of the last ODH update, there are 76 confirmed cases of influenza hospitalizations in the state of Ohio,” said Gastaldo. Dr. Gastaldo is urging Ohioans to get their flu shot as soon as possible to keep themselves and their loved ones healthy. Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

Presence of migratory birds has been cited as reason for recurring instances of avian influenza in the state. Photo: Syed Shiyas Mirza K A ShajiPublished on: 19 Dec 2021, 10:12 pmCopiedThe bird flu scare is back in Kerala: It has, once again, put the spotlight on the urgency to find the underlying reason for its recurrence. Several ducks and local birds in Alappuzha perished during the second week of December. This was followed by a mass culling of ducks in Kottayam district, as the state animal husbandry department issued an alert.Over 27,000 ducks have been culled in the two districts since December 15, according to the latest figures from the animal husbandry department.Earlier this year, Kerala government confirmed an outbreak of avian influenza in the Alappuzha and Kottayam districts January 4, 2021. As many as 12,000 ducks had died due to the infection in parts of Alappuzha and Kottayam, forest and animal husbandry minister K Raju had said. What has prompted the sudden rise in cases again? The presence of migratory birds may have a role to play. Kumarakom Bird Sanctuary is at a little distance from Vechur, Ayamanam and Kallara Grama Panchayats in central Kerala’s Kottayam district, where the presence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) was confirmed December 16, 2021, prompting large-scale culling of ducks. The sanctuary is frequented by several avian species throughout the year.The Panchayats also share a border with Vembanad lake, India’s second-largest wetland ecosystem, where migratory birds flock at regular intervals. While authorities are yet to find the source of the virus, the geographical location and the presence of migratory birds have been cited as the reason for recurring instances of avian influenza, which is now an annual affair.Kumarakom Bird Sanctuary is at a little distance from Vechur, Ayamanam and Kallara Grama Panchayats in central Kerala’s Kottayam district. The Panchayats there share a border with Vembanad lake, India’s second-largest wetland ecosystem. The northern Kuttanad region of the adjacent Alappuzha district also has a high disease prevalence. The samples sent to the National Institute of High-Security Animal Disease, Bhopal, tested positive for HPAI. Waterlogged islands of Kuttanad also spread in the Vembanad Lake. The state government has banned the use and sale of eggs, meat and manure of ducks, chickens, quails and other domestic birds in Champakulam, Nedumudi, Muttar, Veeyapuram, Karuvatta, Thrikkunnapuzha, Thakazhi, Purakkad, Ambalapuzha South, Ambalapuzha North and Edathua panchayats and Haripad municipality area.All these areas are frequented by migratory birds. Action neededThe lackadaisical attitude of the state government has made the situation worse, said VJ Sebastian, a duck farmer of Karuvatta village, which was the epicenter of the outbreak in 2020.“The system acts only when new cases are reported. The authorities maintain no advance vigil. We have been provided with no scientific advice to handle such situations,” he said.According to B Rajasekharan, president of Kerala Duck Farmers’ Association’s Alappuzha district committee, it takes at least two weeks to send samples to Bhopal and confirm the presence of the virus. “The virus outbreak has turned into an annual affair; Alappuzha requires facilities to test and confirm its presence. Early confirmation can help limit culling to smaller areas and avoid massive economic losess to farmers,” he said.When contacted, Animal Husbandry Department joint director PK Santhosh Kumar said no dead migratory bird was spotted in any part of the Kottayam and Alappuzha districts. He added the species that are possibly spreading the disease needed to be spotted. Those who frequently visit the Vembanad lake include Siberian cranes, various herons, darters, bitterns, Brahminy kites, marsh harriers, teals, larks and flycatchers.“There is no vaccine to prevent avian influenza. Farmers have been rearing ducks strictly according to the government guidelines. We are investing heavily in it. So the losses are huge,” said Rajasekharan. Last year, Kuttanad’s duck farms reported several fowl cholera cases caused by Pasteurella multocida and infection of Riemerella anatipestifer, an antibiotic-resistant bacteria. These haven’t been reported so far this year.“We suspect the immunity level of ducks in the region has been on a decline due to the fowl cholera and Riemerella. They have become susceptible to the avian flu virus,” said Kumar.Culling of a duck older than two months entails a compensation of Rs 200; it is Rs 100 for ducks below two months. Farmers allege the rates are very nominal. The first significant outbreak was in 2014, and several duck farmers of the region shifted to other jobs as it eventually turned into an annual affair. A round-the-year surveillance mechanism for migratory birds is essential to fix their role scientifically, according to PO Nameer, a professor with the Department of Wildlife Sciences, Kerala Agriculture University.“Regular monitoring of wild aquatic birds and the wild bird-poultry-wetland interface is essential to understanding avian influenza viruses’ prevalence,” he said.The local communities, too, are on the receiving end: They are bound to face substantial economic losses during Christmas and New Year.“Unlike other parts of Kerala, Kuttanad and Kumarakom regions have been attracting several migratory avian species. The backwaters and water bodies of the region are feeding them. The rearing of ducks is a major source of income for the local community, so the risk of HPAI is high. The situation prompts us to conclude that birds from other countries carry the virus, though more research is needed. Right now, mass culling is the only option,” said Shaji Panikkassery, district coordinator, Disease Control Project, Kerala Animal Husbandry Department.Kerala forest minister AK Saseendran told Down to Earth that the Department of Social Forestry has been directed to monitor migratory birds in and around Alappuzha and Kottayam. He added that massive surveillance against migratory birds dying unnaturally has been in place. Restrictions on fishing in the backwater regions of Alappuzha have also been enforced.IndiaWildlife & BiodiversityKeralaAvian Flubird fluAvian influenzaBird cullingMigratory BirdsAlappuzha districtKottayamShow CommentsRelated StoriesNo stories found.
